<b></b><p>Coming into the 2016 Parading Season, we're entering the final stretch to finish our new, top-secret float. It's going to be the biggest, most imaginative creation we've dreamed up.  We will debut her during Carnival, but our long-term intent is to share her with the larger community. We want to create educational opportunities to engage, influence &amp; inspire people of all ages in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Countless studies have shown that creative problem-solving improves brain function for people of all ages.  Studies also show that when you take art away from kids, their performance in Math and Science correspondingly go down.  A list of developmental benefits of art from PBS can be seen at <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/parents/education/music-arts/the-importance-of-art-in-child-development/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.pbs.org/parents/education/music-arts...</a></p>
<p>We want to show people of all ages that they can gather some friends, find some re-purposed materials, and build something magical.</p>
<p>Initially we will work with 501c3 not-for-profit Chewbacchus and Ignition Event Management LLC to create educational opportunities to engage the community.</p>
<p>Our intent is to later partner with some local schools and other organizations to share our project with people from the community, give a presentation about our process from design to materials and execution, and allow them to interact with and explore our creation.</p>
<p>As our krewe expands, our goal is to host free workshops to teach fundamental construction and crafting techniques, providing hands-on building experience that can be utilized in countless ways.  </p>
<p>In order to start this journey we need to have the ability to house our creation and a way to transport her to these opportunities.</p>

Interrobang Parading Krewe is a diverse group of creators; artists, builders, musicians, fire breathers, DJ’s, dancers, cooks, mechanics, engineers, and dreamers. We have different visions, different voices. 
But together we found a common goal: 

Creating large-scale kinetic art to share with the community during Carnival and beyond...

In order to start this journey we need to have the ability to house our creation and a way to transport her to these opportunities.
And we could use your help. 






We've set up a special account to specifically cover these costs:



Housing solution and storage to keep our new float shielded from the elements


Transportation materials to increase the mobility of the float for sharing it with a wider section of the community (without having to hand-push it there!)


Dependable power source for light and sound (non-borrowed)

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Summary</h3> <p>I never imagined that a single tree could change my life or the lives of others.</p>
<p>I'm Mike Pach, and I'm a photographer from Colorado Springs. I am the founder of the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/cplg1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Colorado Photography Learning Group</a>, and I teach photography and Photoshop classes. I also volunteer for <a href=""http://www,kcmj.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KCMJ 93.9 FM</a> where I have 2 shows on Monday nights (<a href=""http://kcmj.org/photoshow/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Photo Show</a> and <a href=""http://kcmj.org/3rdgroove/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">3rd Groove</a>).</p>
<p>On January 11th, 2015 a storm brought ice, snow and fog to Colorado Springs. The next day, I was drawn to a tree behind my home. I couldn't help but notice how beautiful it looked, covered in snow and ice, so I photographed it from my yard.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460515104/12_IMG_6423a_if0xoe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Later that day, the idea came to me of photographing the tree every day for a year. I set a goal for myself to create a unique image of this tree each day, and I reached that goal on January 11th 2016. All of those photos can be viewed on the <a href=""https://sametreedifferentday.wordpress.com/this-blogs-story/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Same Tree, Different Day blog</a>.</div><div>
<br/><p>What started out as an exercise in creativity ended up being much more than a collection of photographs. I realized that my story and the story of the tree could have a huge impact on people in communities everywhere. The method I used to reach my goal and the lessons I learned throughout this project have become just as important as the photographs themselves. Contributing to this campaign will allow me to bring this story to anyone in need of inspiration.</p>
<p>One tree and one year is what it took for me to find my voice. I want to share this experience with as many people as possible.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I will need $10,000 to frame and print the photos I want to have in a gallery display. This includes my favorite images from each month, large prints that contain all the photos from each month and a large mosaic made from all of the photos I took throughout the year. I was rather shocked when I crunched the numbers, but if you are a photographer or artist, you know that framing is expensive!</p>
<p>In exchange for your generous contributions, I will offer prints of any photo from this project. You get to choose any photo found on the <a href=""https://sametreedifferentday.wordpress.com/this-blogs-story/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Same Tree, Different Day blog</a>. Perhaps you'd like the photo taken on your birthday, an anniversary or another special day in your life. Prints include free shipping within the United States. I will also offer one-on-one photography or Photoshop instruction if you are willing and able to come to beautiful Colorado Springs. </p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of perks:</p>
<p>$50 = One 10""x 15"" photo print<br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">$100 = One 12""x 18"" photo print<br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">$150 = One 16""x 20"" photo print</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><br/>$250 = One 20""x 30"" photo print<br/>$500 = 4 hours of one-on-one photography or Photoshop instruction<br/>$1000 = 8 hours of one-on-one photography or Photoshop instruction</span></p>
<p>If I do not reach my entire goal, I will still use the money to print and frame some photos, but the work will have to be done in stages. I will also look to get funding from grants through organizations like the Colorado Tree Coalition.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>

</div></div>","Summary I never imagined that a single tree could change my life or the lives of others.
I'm Mike Pach, and I'm a photographer from Colorado Springs. I am the founder of the Colorado Photography Learning Group, and I teach photography and Photoshop classes. I also volunteer for KCMJ 93.9 FM where I have 2 shows on Monday nights (The Photo Show and 3rd Groove).
On January 11th, 2015 a storm brought ice, snow and fog to Colorado Springs. The next day, I was drawn to a tree behind my home. I couldn't help but notice how beautiful it looked, covered in snow and ice, so I photographed it from my yard.

Later that day, the idea came to me of photographing the tree every day for a year. I set a goal for myself to create a unique image of this tree each day, and I reached that goal on January 11th 2016. All of those photos can be viewed on the Same Tree, Different Day blog.
What started out as an exercise in creativity ended up being much more than a collection of photographs. I realized that my story and the story of the tree could have a huge impact on people in communities everywhere. The method I used to reach my goal and the lessons I learned throughout this project have become just as important as the photographs themselves. Contributing to this campaign will allow me to bring this story to anyone in need of inspiration.
One tree and one year is what it took for me to find my voice. I want to share this experience with as many people as possible.   What I Need & What You Get I will need $10,000 to frame and print the photos I want to have in a gallery display. This includes my favorite images from each month, large prints that contain all the photos from each month and a large mosaic made from all of the photos I took throughout the year. I was rather shocked when I crunched the numbers, but if you are a photographer or artist, you know that framing is expensive!
In exchange for your generous contributions, I will offer prints of any photo from this project. You get to choose any photo found on the Same Tree, Different Day blog. Perhaps you'd like the photo taken on your birthday, an anniversary or another special day in your life. Prints include free shipping within the United States. I will also offer one-on-one photography or Photoshop instruction if you are willing and able to come to beautiful Colorado Springs. 
Here is the breakdown of perks:
$50 = One 10""x 15"" photo print$100 = One 12""x 18"" photo print$150 = One 16""x 20"" photo print$250 = One 20""x 30"" photo print$500 = 4 hours of one-on-one photography or Photoshop instruction$1000 = 8 hours of one-on-one photography or Photoshop instruction
If I do not reach my entire goal, I will still use the money to print and frame some photos, but the work will have to be done in stages. I will also look to get funding from grants through organizations like the Colorado Tree Coalition.   The Impact 
As someone who deals with 3 disabling illnesses (fibromyalgia, depression and chemical sensitivities) I strongly believe that this project has the power to inspire others to achieve their goals and live lives full of awareness.
If one tree can have this much of an impact on me and those who become aware of this project and its lessons, imagine what 1,000 trees or 1,000,000 trees could do to change our world in a positive way.Your contributions will help bring the messages of this project to more people and inspire others to create similar projects with their own positive messages.  This project and the slideshow I created with all of the photos from the year were debuted on April 15, 2016 during an Arbor Day event that I hosted at Library 21c in Colorado Springs. The event was a collaboration between myself, the Trails and Open Space Coalition, the Council of Neighbors and Organizations, the Colorado Springs Conservatory, the Therapeutic Recreation Program of Colorado Springs, the Pikes Peak Library Distrct and Jay Billup's Creative Magazine.Here's what people had to say about the presentation:""This was a wonderful evening. Very thought provoking and inspiring. Mike, your insights into your journey with this project were profound. Thank you for sharing it with us. I loved the quote you showed at the beginning of the program and will make a point to follow it each day and remind myself to be open and really see the beauty that is right in front of us.

<p>Hello everyone! <b>GOT FRAMED</b> is exciting and playful art installation we can bring to Burning Man this year! Picture this - an 12ft tall picture-frame for people to dress up with their friends and play in while someone captures the moment from outside. Swing and hang from monkey bars across the top, climb up the side ladders and jump in the center! Snap a pic from outside and the moment lives as a souvenir forever. The highly interactive design promotes community participation, encouraging PEOPLE to BE THE ART. Inspired by my Grandmother, whose 91 years have been spent living in the moment, Got Framed invites you to do the same!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432402582/n3mn5wenbr87fljeqfk1.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 313.63981042654px; height: 406px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432402614/lfnu71jngcml3ywnvhpw.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 305.668292682927px; height: 388px; background-color: initial;""/></p><p></p><ul>

</ul><p>What’s more, the unfinished walls inside of the frame allows people to write a message, leave a signature or share their favorite memory for others to enjoy reading. Bringing community together is the idea that fuels this project. By contributing to Got Framed, you will add life to the city, inspire creativity, self expression and allow people to snap a pic and keep that moment forever. The initial vision for Got Framed occurred to me while driving back from Burning Man in 2013. </p>

</span></p><p>The idea spurred from the thought of my addiction to taking
pictures but never framing them. The act of framing a memory adds another level
of significance to it. Take a second to think of a moment in time that you feel
deserves to be framed, whether in your past or present. Got Framed provides the
opportunity to frame these memories, while truly appreciating and enjoying the
present! We live in a society where we often forget to live in the moment. Got
Framed brings us back to the pure joy of now, connecting us with friends,
family, and strangers to cherish this moment with or without a camera. I need
your help to create this inspiring piece of art! Once Burning Man is complete,
I will bring itback to Los Angeles for you and the entire community to enjoy!
The funding will cover all tools, materials, professional labor and consulting,
space rentals for building and transportation. From someone who chooses to
celebrate his birthday volunteering (for 6 years in a row) and invites friends
to join, there are additional ways for you to help and get involved! Please
feel free to approach me, sign up on our VOLUNTEER list and have
fun with us!</p>

talented network of experienced builders, Got Framed would be made of
recycled/reclaimed materials with baroque style and rose motif. It would

</div>","Hello everyone! GOT FRAMED is exciting and playful art installation we can bring to Burning Man this year! Picture this - an 12ft tall picture-frame for people to dress up with their friends and play in while someone captures the moment from outside. Swing and hang from monkey bars across the top, climb up the side ladders and jump in the center! Snap a pic from outside and the moment lives as a souvenir forever. The highly interactive design promotes community participation, encouraging PEOPLE to BE THE ART. Inspired by my Grandmother, whose 91 years have been spent living in the moment, Got Framed invites you to do the same!

Got Framed Prototype & 2D Plans

Got Framed Concept on the playa
What’s more, the unfinished walls inside of the frame allows people to write a message, leave a signature or share their favorite memory for others to enjoy reading. Bringing community together is the idea that fuels this project. By contributing to Got Framed, you will add life to the city, inspire creativity, self expression and allow people to snap a pic and keep that moment forever. The initial vision for Got Framed occurred to me while driving back from Burning Man in 2013. 

The idea spurred from the thought of my addiction to taking
pictures but never framing them. The act of framing a memory adds another level
of significance to it. Take a second to think of a moment in time that you feel
deserves to be framed, whether in your past or present. Got Framed provides the
opportunity to frame these memories, while truly appreciating and enjoying the
present! We live in a society where we often forget to live in the moment. Got
Framed brings us back to the pure joy of now, connecting us with friends,
family, and strangers to cherish this moment with or without a camera. I need
your help to create this inspiring piece of art! Once Burning Man is complete,
I will bring itback to Los Angeles for you and the entire community to enjoy!
The funding will cover all tools, materials, professional labor and consulting,
space rentals for building and transportation. From someone who chooses to
celebrate his birthday volunteering (for 6 years in a row) and invites friends
to join, there are additional ways for you to help and get involved! Please
feel free to approach me, sign up on our VOLUNTEER list and have
fun with us!
My name is NiNO, I was born and raised in Puerto Rico. Attracted to American culture via TV, I had to figure out a way to move. I joined an exchange program my sophomore year and transferred to IPFW in IN where I finished my B.A. in Graphic Design, with a minor in Performing Arts. After graduation I moved to LA. In the last 10 years, I've been art directing and set designing for stage, film &amp; TV, including a team member of the Design Producer Crew for NBC's reality show American Dream Builders. Recently I had an awakening and a change of path of wanting to pursue my talent as an artist again. It started with painting a nursery mural as a gift tofriends. After that, I created several more murals. I found myself feeling a different satisfaction for big canvases and enjoying the freedom to imagine in a bigger scale.

<div>Hello everyone, Ben Revord here! I'm an independent artist from Pittsfield, Massachusetts. I'm in the process of re-booting my business in the state of Hawaii. Recently, I transplanted from the bay area of California, to Kailua, Oahu. I own and operate a 40 Watt Full Spectrum Laser Engraver/Cutter/Etcher, and am equipped to take on a large variety of projects. I've been in operations since February of 2014, but have only been able to casually make and sell my creations. Initially, I was an artist with only a pencil, paper, and drafting tools. Now I am striving toward the bright horizons of graphic design, precision pyrography, and the commodification of my arts. I have a developing focus of working with eco-friendly, sustainable, green, rescued, and/or recycled materials. My dream is to be able to lean fully on my arts as a source of income and inspiration for others. I've gotten my feet wet in the vending circuit over the years and want nothing more than to dive in deep. But first I need stock/inventory/materials.<span><br/></span><span><span><h3><br/></h3>

</div></div>","Aloha!

Hello everyone, Ben Revord here! I'm an independent artist from Pittsfield, Massachusetts. I'm in the process of re-booting my business in the state of Hawaii. Recently, I transplanted from the bay area of California, to Kailua, Oahu. I own and operate a 40 Watt Full Spectrum Laser Engraver/Cutter/Etcher, and am equipped to take on a large variety of projects. I've been in operations since February of 2014, but have only been able to casually make and sell my creations. Initially, I was an artist with only a pencil, paper, and drafting tools. Now I am striving toward the bright horizons of graphic design, precision pyrography, and the commodification of my arts. I have a developing focus of working with eco-friendly, sustainable, green, rescued, and/or recycled materials. My dream is to be able to lean fully on my arts as a source of income and inspiration for others. I've gotten my feet wet in the vending circuit over the years and want nothing more than to dive in deep. But first I need stock/inventory/materials.

Here Are Some Examples Of My Work:

me, including recognizing my strength in art as well as supporting and
encouraging me to pursue my Master of Fine Art in
Animation and publish my book GUWLKY.</p>
<p>Without

I had the dream to turn my book into animation since the 1st edition GUWLKY was
published in 2000 after I graduated from NAFA. I shared with many people. Many
laughed. Some shook their heads and said it was very expensive and impossible.

</p><p>I went
around talking to different studios and publishers to ask if they were
interested. I received no positive reply. It was just a wild dream then.</p>
<p>Subsequently,
I decided to pursue a degree in animation on scholarship. After I completed my
master in animation in 2007, I started to ask for support, be it sponsorship or
grant/funding in my animation project again. As you may have guessed,
there were no positive replies again.</p>
<p>Opportunities knocked, but in a different way.
I decided to write and illustrate the second edition of ""Growing up
with Lee Kuan Yew"" in 2013. This second edition was well received and
became the bestseller. This motivated me to apply for the SG50
Celebration Fund. This time round, I received its approval. While SG50
Celebration Fund supported me with 50% of my project expenditure, I am going to
raise the remaining 50% of the remaining project expenditure.</p>

almost gunned down then while I was moonlighting as a street artist at Savannah

appreciate the affordable enrichment classes, piano class, violin class,
swimming class, Taekwondo class that my 7 years old daughter and 5 years old
son are having. I do not own a car but appreciate that I just need to wait for
2 minutes for our MRT train though I feel it is as packed as Japan and we
should learn more train etiquette. <br/>

   Challenges Rest assured, I will be doing everything in my power to keep the costs low, and the adventure interesting, so that the effectiveness of your donations are maximized. This includes, but is not limited to:  Staying in the free-est and/or cheapest possible, but still relatively safe couches, hostels, and Airbnb's.
Eating and drinking frugally, unless there is reason to splurge for the cause of experiencing the culture and/or providing content for the zine. 
Finding everything from odd jobs to au pairing to keep the money flowing and the adventure going and the book growing. 


I'm going to be completely honest with you...
This project is as much about...



fully realizing my writing and artistic style as it is about... 


producing the best possible product for others to enjoy as it is about...


creating an undeniable portfolio for when I get home and need to re-join the world as it is about...

raising money prolong and intensify the adventure I have always dreamt about.
So there are a couple of selfish reasons in there, sure, but each one of these goals only serves to increase the effort of realizing the others, and I have no doubt in my mind that the growth seen in me from the first page to the last will be just as interesting to see as any drawing, photograph, or story found within. 
   Other Ways to Help
No one understands better than I do right now that sometimes you just can't part with a dollar. If this is the case, hopefully you can be of other assistance...  If you know of anyone in Europe that would be willing to let me stay at their place for free/cheap/cleaning services, regardless of where they are, or what the sleeping arrangement is, I would love to add another stop to my journey.

Help me get the word out and I'll definitely remember it when it comes time to sell the final product.

If you have been to any of these places and have recommendations, I would love to hear them, or if there is somewhere you think I absolutely must visit, let me know and let me know why.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

10years of my artistic practice in the VFX Animation Industry, personal unique
art style development, and hosting large &amp; intimate scale community events
for cultural artistic advancement. As of the summer of 2014 I made a transition
into personal studies of the visual development behind character illustration
in a contemporary unique style through painting, sculpture, and drawing. I
am now positioned to dedicate full-time to my personal art, community practice,
documentation, research, and development. I
host workshops, lectures, and events in Utah and across the nation. My style
of art: illustration tells a story; stories hold lessons, inspiration, and
dreams- I plan to take this next chapter to reside in Utah, travel across
cities and develop public art pieces which enlighten lives, the imagery and
style is designed to connect with every age of our society. Your contributions  are a

If need arise, you can e-mail me, or leave a private comment on the campaign page. All the art in the list was made during the last year in college, so it was a culmination of all my work at the time, and it indeed felt so. They will be a reminder of my gratitude to you, and possibly more than that.OTHER INFORMATIONThe rest of the money raised will go to pay off the campaign, which will consist of making, printing and shipping of art, paying the necessary percentage to Indiegogo, etc. All the finished works offered as perks are stored in Sarasota, Florida, so if you are around, it'd be great if you could pick up your piece yourself; contact me. Otherwise, it will be shipped to you after the campaign is over, either as it is, or unstretched, depending on the distance, and money available.In case we go over the goal, or if anything is left after I paid for the campaign, I will spend the money to ship the work that is left home, from the US to Belarus. THANK YOU! PS Please, share the campaign on your social networks./////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////ХТО, ШТО І ЧАМУМяне завуць Макар Маліноўскі.

<p>Across Zimbabwe,
there is a shortage of professionally trained visual arts curators. Whilst
there have been a number of positive developments in the exhibiting of art in
Zimbabwe, it nevertheless remains the case that there is still much to be done,
to create a network of professionally-trained curators and art administrators,
able to carry forward the project of ensuring that art in Zimbabwe becomes an
ever-greater part of the culture of our nation. Developing curatorial expertise
in Africa and across Zimbabwe in particular is a key part of this step forward.
I am confident that this opportunity, to study in London, will further equip me
to carry forward my commitment to art in Zimbabwe and the project of gaining
ever-greater respect for the fantastic work that our artists make.</p>
<p>Since 2005 Kingston
University has developed a growing relationship with the National Gallery of
Zimbabwe through Raphael Chikukwa, an alumnus of the programme.  In 2012 we welcomed 3 members of staff from
Kingston University to help deliver a project brief with basket makers in
Lupane.  During this visit I was
fortunate enough to work closely with these people and saw first-hand the ways
in which professional training of curators can have such a wonderful and
beneficial effect on so many aspects of art and culture. I had the opportunity
for an interview with Professor Catherine McDermott, the Kingston University
course director and we both feel confident that London and its connections with
international art will offer an invaluable experience for me that will not only
enrich my own professional life, but will also make major and long-lasting
contributions to art and culture in Zimbabwe, and the institutions established
to support creativity in our country.</p>
<p>The international
profile of Zimbabwean Art was raised enormously through the inaugural
Zimbabwean Pavilion in 2011 at the Venice Biennale. One of our greatest
challenges is to build on this triumph by increasing the pool of professional
curators who are able to represent Zimbabwe, both within and beyond the
country. It is for this reason that I am keen to avail myself of the
opportunity to study at this important London College.</p>
<p>My experience as a
curator includes being assistant and supporting intern at the 54th
international Venice Biennale 2011. This was a fabulous opportunity that
enabled me to further consider the ways in which the curator can make no end of
important contributions, on so many different fronts. </p>
<p>In May 2012, I spent
a week with other emerging African curators from countries such as Kenya,
Burundi, Uganda and Angola, in the 10th Dakar Biennale, the Continent’s most
established large-scale international exhibition. I am ready to further acquire
much needed skills and qualifications, to enable me to better serve Zimbabwean
artists.</p>
<p>In September and
October of 2013 I travelled to the London and Wales for a 10 day curatorial and
artists’ workshop. The UK presented a great opportunity to visit galleries and
exhibitions that took place around the UK</p>
<p>Outside my curatorial
work, I chair the Visual Artists Association of Bulawayo, a body of artists
that meets and decides how the arts in the region should be administered. I
have created partnerships with the National Gallery in Bulawayo and other galleries
in South Africa and Botswana. I served in various creative sector committees
like the Culture fund of Zimbabwe Trust, Limpopo Spatial Development Committee
Creative sector and give advice to Mzilikazi Art and Craft centre and the
Bulawayo Poly Art School.</p>
<p>The experience I gain
from studying in London will be invaluable. I intend to work on developing
professional curatorial practice that will see the appreciation of contemporary
curating through the delivery quality of exhibitions facilitation of workshops
and network lines throughout the country and the region especially in countries
like Botswana, Zambia and Malawi. I intend to hold workshops in the gallery on
curating/ work with the course to create a legacy and connections with London
and Kingston that will support my work and the work of colleagues in Zimbabwe.
The country’s policy on freedom of expression has been a challenge to an
affective creative sector and the regional politics should inspire new
engagements and interrogations. In February 2013 the NGZ will be organising the
first curatorial workshop in Zimbabwe and Bulawayo will host the workshop.</p>
<p>In 2014 I
participated in the 35day ASIKO International Art School in Dakar Senegal
through the Centre for Contemporary Arts of Lagos Nigeria (CCA, Lagos) run By
Bisi Silva. The 4th edition was titled “A History of contemporary arts in Dakar
in 5 weeks” the ASIKO school was held alongside Africa’s contemporary art
space, the 11<sup>th</sup> edition of the Dak Art Biennale.</p>

</h3> <p>My name is Megan, and my passion is art. In High School I was in a 3-D Art concentration class for two years, and I found that I was really able to express myself, have fun, and make amazing works of art. One medium of work really stuck out to me, and something that I loved working with, was glass. Working with glass in anyway possible, it was a calling that I would sorely miss after graduating.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1418499/files/20150427063848-IMG_1420.JPG?1430141928"" src="""" style=""width: 352.696817420436px; height: 470px;""/> </p>
<p>I've created a large window hanging or my own design, incorporating Kanji from the Japanese language, with an included Copper Repousse piece in the middle. I've also designed and constructed a glass and mirror vase, with a design influenced by the shape of a handheld harp. For a Hispanic Heritage project I constructed a stained glass necklace, that doubles as a decorative piece, and a functional piece of jewelry. And something that I use everyday, still, is a mosaic coffee table, made from a wooden coffee table that was going to be discarded.</p>
<p>With this campaign I'd like to raise the funds to make a studio so i can start working with glass again. There's no design to out there, no idea too hard, I want to experiment and to make, to give a little beauty to the world. I want to keep learning about more glass techniques, like glass blowing, glass fusing, bead making.</p>

</p><p>·<span>  </span>Have you ever tried to find our Armenian
national epic online as an e-book?  </p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Have you ever thought of our national epic
when trying to buy one of the first fairy tale books for your children? </p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Have you ever thought how powerful our national
epic is and how could it actually change our children's mindset?</p>
<p>A very
simple, yet very powerful and impactful project - <b>to publish the 1st fully illustrated print book and the first ever
e-book of The Daredevils of Sassoun in Armenian and in English, both as a
hardcover/paperback book and an e-book.</b>  We
have done an extensive research on all the publications of the Armenian national
epic and here is what we found out: </p>
<p>·<span>  </span>There is no e-book, </p>
<p>·<span>  </span>There is no edition that would have a full
list of illustrations (for 4 chapters) with characters that could inspire
children and make them believe in the power of the Armenian
""dyutsazunner"".</p>
<p>So why not
to revive the soul of the often forgotten heroes from our national epic for
thousands of children in Armenia and abroad? 
</p>
<p>Back in
1990s our father, Khoren Hakobyan, thought of this (he is children's book
illustrator and he has illustrated more than 100 books).  So he created probably the first and the only
full series of illustrations, covering the entire story - every character and
every episode. This was a result of over 10 years of dedicated work.  </p>
<p>Today, on
the threshold of our father's 70th anniversary, our family  (David Hakobyan, the son, Anna Hakobyan and
Rebecca Hakobyan, the daughters) would like to fulfill our father's dream: TO
BRING THE DAREDEVILS OF SASSOUN CLOSER TO CHILDREN AND HAVE THEM INSPIRED WITH THE ARMENIAN EPICAL HEROES. We want to publish the 1st fully illustrated
edition of the epic that would help our children see our national epic in
vibrant characters from the beginning to the end. </p>
<p><b>Investment Needs</b></p>
<p>Today we are fundraising for the entire
cycle of print and e-book publication, as well as for marketing costs that
would help us spread out the word about this special and unique edition of the
Armenian national epic.  </p>
<p>·<span>  </span>USD 6500 will be required to print 1000 copies of the books.</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>USD 2000 will be dedicated to design, programming, text editing
and other miscellaneous production costs.</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>USD 2000 will be streamed towards on-site and online marketing
(i.e. posters design and printing, FB ads, web banner design and web
advertising on targeted websites, etc.)</p>
<p>In case we are not able to reach the targeted funding, we will
use the available funds primarily for production costs and printing (the
quantity would depend on the available funds). 
</p>
<p><b>Reporting</b></p>
<p>We would like to assure that we are ready to be very transparent
and to report to our  contributors about
the expenses and project progress on regular basis. Should you be willing to

<br/></div>","·  Have you ever tried to find our Armenian
national epic online as an e-book?  
·  Have you ever thought of our national epic
when trying to buy one of the first fairy tale books for your children? 
·  Have you ever thought how powerful our national
epic is and how could it actually change our children's mindset?
A very
simple, yet very powerful and impactful project - to publish the 1st fully illustrated print book and the first ever
e-book of The Daredevils of Sassoun in Armenian and in English, both as a
hardcover/paperback book and an e-book.  We
have done an extensive research on all the publications of the Armenian national
epic and here is what we found out: 
·  There is no e-book, 
·  There is no edition that would have a full
list of illustrations (for 4 chapters) with characters that could inspire
children and make them believe in the power of the Armenian
""dyutsazunner"".
So why not
to revive the soul of the often forgotten heroes from our national epic for
thousands of children in Armenia and abroad? 

Back in
1990s our father, Khoren Hakobyan, thought of this (he is children's book
illustrator and he has illustrated more than 100 books).  So he created probably the first and the only
full series of illustrations, covering the entire story - every character and
every episode. This was a result of over 10 years of dedicated work.  
Today, on
the threshold of our father's 70th anniversary, our family  (David Hakobyan, the son, Anna Hakobyan and
Rebecca Hakobyan, the daughters) would like to fulfill our father's dream: TO
BRING THE DAREDEVILS OF SASSOUN CLOSER TO CHILDREN AND HAVE THEM INSPIRED WITH THE ARMENIAN EPICAL HEROES. We want to publish the 1st fully illustrated
edition of the epic that would help our children see our national epic in
vibrant characters from the beginning to the end. 
Investment Needs
Today we are fundraising for the entire
cycle of print and e-book publication, as well as for marketing costs that
would help us spread out the word about this special and unique edition of the
Armenian national epic.  
·  USD 6500 will be required to print 1000 copies of the books.
·  USD 2000 will be dedicated to design, programming, text editing
and other miscellaneous production costs.
·  USD 2000 will be streamed towards on-site and online marketing
(i.e. posters design and printing, FB ads, web banner design and web
advertising on targeted websites, etc.)
In case we are not able to reach the targeted funding, we will
use the available funds primarily for production costs and printing (the
quantity would depend on the available funds). 

Reporting
We would like to assure that we are ready to be very transparent
and to report to our  contributors about
the expenses and project progress on regular basis. Should you be willing to
receive progress reports and final report of this project, please send a short
message to daredevilsofsassoun@gmail.com.

Benefits for Investors
We will highly appreciate any invested amount. Furthermore, we are delighted to provide a wide range of benefits to
our potential investors, including special sponsorship packages with exclusive rewards.  
THANK YOU!
We would like to thank you for your interest
and shared enthusiasm.  We would greatly
appreciate if you could share the information about this project via
Indiegogo share tools, social media or in any other format.  
Thank you once again!

<p>SlutWalk Ecuador re appropriates the insult ""slut,"" with its loaded meaning as an insult dedicated to women and other femininities, to expose and subvert the burden that it carries. In doing so, we demand an end to the practice of blaming the victims of sexualized violence for ""provoking"" their own abuse. We demand that our call for the eradication of inequality and gender violence be a requirement to any and all political and social justice agendas. We affirm the sexual and reproductive rights of transgender people and people who engage in sex work.</p>
<p>""SlutWalk"" was born in Canada in April 2011, following the statements of police officer Michael Sanguinetti during a conference on public safety in the Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto. The officer said that ""women should avoid dressing like ""sluts"" to avoid being victims of sexual violence."" The ""Slutwalk"" (as the first march was called) is a public denouncement of all forms of violence against women, as well as the social and institutional structure that reproduces and justifies such violence. The movement has reached more than 60 countries so far, with particular strength in Latin America.</p>
<p>In Ecuador, the SlutWalk has become a permanent platform for feminist thought and action (thereby bearing the same name and permanent collective annual event). The platform brings together men, women and people of all of different sex-gender identites to engage in trainings, political lobbying on policies surrounding equality, public actions to denounce gender violence and, of course, the organization of the annual Slutwalk, which begins in El Parque del Ejido and ends in the Plaza Foch with the “El Festival Emputado” or, ""Slut Festival"".</p>
<p>The feminist activists of Slutwalk Ecuador are seeking to raise $600 for the production of the festival. The main highlight of SlutWalk, “El Festival Emputado” has been carried out for three consecutive years and each year the quality of the festival has grown enormously. Our fourth festival will take place on Saturday March 21st 2015.</p>
<p>Costs</p>
<p>We are installing a stage in Quito’s Foch Plaza, where we are expecting nearly 7,000 people to gather after the march. Like every year, women, trans people will fill the stage as feminist bands and artists preform. Traditionally, there is a strong presence of feminist hip hop artists from southern Quito. El Festival Emputado is a feminist party where we denounce gender-based violence, and celebrate aesthetic, sexual, and gender freedom. We hold public institutions responsible for implementing policies that promote equality and prevent against gender-based violence. We collectively read from our self-written Slutwalk Manifesto. Each year, the Festival brings a guest artist from another country. This year's guest is the female hip hop artist Vasca “Furia Soprano.” Because we are a militant feminist movement, we do not receive any institutional support. For this reason, and the costs of the stage and the sound equipment is raised solely by activists. This crowd funding page is our way of helping to cover some of these costs.</p>

<p>100% of <i>all</i> money raised through this campaign will go toward paying the tuition fees, which are £20k. This pays for two years’ full-time study. I am covering my living costs, which I predict to be in the region of £25k for two years.</p>
<p>I have included images here from various recent projects of mine.</p>
<p>One of the stipulations of this campaign is that I offer “perks” to donors. This actually fits well with my art practice, which is collaborative and participatory. In previous projects I have entered the homes of strangers, gifted and installed artworks in their homes and then had a conversation with them about art, arts function and arts value.</p>

<p>I would like to use this idea for this campaign. If you donate £1000 or more, I will produce an artwork for you and for those of you who live in Sheffield or London, I would like the opportunity to visit your home to present and install the artwork. For those of you living elsewhere this may be tricky but I’m open to discussing an alternative. Other great perks are available for smaller donations.</p>

<p>I believe that my time and my skills are best spent making and sharing art. After starting out in a career that wasn’t suited for me, I have finally found something that I’m passionate about and that I want to do for the rest of my life. Art has enriched my life with so much meaning.</p>
<p>It’s important for me to say that I’ve already worked extremely hard to get to where I am now. I’ve worked night shifts while attending my foundation course during the day. I’ve worked every holiday and every summer to fund my last four years at university. As a masters student, there are now much fewer funding options. Getting your support will mean so much to me and I absolutely <i>will</i> make the most of the opportunities it will give me.</p>

<p>In the last five years I have exhibited internationally in the UK, France, Norway, Turkey, Thailand and China. I have taken part in art residencies in the UK, Norway and China. I have also worked as an assistant to four artists and designers. I have just held my first solo exhibition in my hometown of Sheffield, for which I produced and curated 62 new artworks and managed my own publicity. This exhibition is a springboard for this crowdfunding campaign. I’m enthusiastic, proactive and I want to continue the momentum that I currently have and take it to the Royal College of Art, one of the most challenging and stimulating learning environments in the world.</p>

</div></div>","100% of all money raised through this campaign will go toward paying the tuition fees, which are £20k. This pays for two years’ full-time study. I am covering my living costs, which I predict to be in the region of £25k for two years.
I have included images here from various recent projects of mine.
One of the stipulations of this campaign is that I offer “perks” to donors. This actually fits well with my art practice, which is collaborative and participatory. In previous projects I have entered the homes of strangers, gifted and installed artworks in their homes and then had a conversation with them about art, arts function and arts value.
 
I would like to use this idea for this campaign. If you donate £1000 or more, I will produce an artwork for you and for those of you who live in Sheffield or London, I would like the opportunity to visit your home to present and install the artwork. For those of you living elsewhere this may be tricky but I’m open to discussing an alternative. Other great perks are available for smaller donations.

I believe that my time and my skills are best spent making and sharing art. After starting out in a career that wasn’t suited for me, I have finally found something that I’m passionate about and that I want to do for the rest of my life. Art has enriched my life with so much meaning.
It’s important for me to say that I’ve already worked extremely hard to get to where I am now. I’ve worked night shifts while attending my foundation course during the day. I’ve worked every holiday and every summer to fund my last four years at university. As a masters student, there are now much fewer funding options. Getting your support will mean so much to me and I absolutely will make the most of the opportunities it will give me.

In the last five years I have exhibited internationally in the UK, France, Norway, Turkey, Thailand and China. I have taken part in art residencies in the UK, Norway and China. I have also worked as an assistant to four artists and designers. I have just held my first solo exhibition in my hometown of Sheffield, for which I produced and curated 62 new artworks and managed my own publicity. This exhibition is a springboard for this crowdfunding campaign. I’m enthusiastic, proactive and I want to continue the momentum that I currently have and take it to the Royal College of Art, one of the most challenging and stimulating learning environments in the world.

 
Any support you can give is appreciated. If you cannot donate, you can still help in a big way by sharing this campaign on social media. Thank you very much for your time.

<h3>Bridget Bishop Presents: The Salem Bitch Trials</h3>
<p>Please help the Haus of Bishop team as we embark on our Off-Broadway premiere. Originally created as a work for Jared Rubin-Sprowls' undergraduate thesis, The Salem Bitch Trials is an experimental means of adapting drag culture for a conventional theater audience with no water added. We'll get our hands dirty with issues of authenticity and identity -- but we're also going to dish out the fun and serve up the shade, all to the tune of Donna Summers' greatest hits. This play hopes to give crucial visibility to LGBTQ issues, as well as show you an exciting new side of theater that you never even knew you needed.</p>
<p>Thanks to a grant from The Araca Group, we have the space -- but now we need the $$$ to make the show happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're a scrappy show -- but we want to do right by the people who believe in us. We believe the arts should be accessible to all, and that the people making the art are our most valuable asset -- so we're paying our actors a living wage to put our money where our mouth is. Approximately 85% of our budget will go to the salaries of the actors as well as the creative team. Here's the rest of the breakdown:</p>
<p>7%: Set pieces and Sound/Lighting rentals</p>
<p>1.5%: Marketing</p>
<p>1.5%: Concessions</p>
<p>5%: Travel</p>
<p>We will put on this show no matter the budget, but 5,000 is what we need in order to fulfill our financial obligations and pay our artists what they deserve. </p>
<p>There are some perks!</p>
<p>$10 and higher: A personalized thank you note from the producers.</p>
<p>$25 and higher: A personalized thank you note with a little somethin' special from our team.</p>
<p>$50 and higher: A personalized thank you note with a poster with a signature and the smooch from the cast. </p>
<p>$100 and higher: A personalized thank you note, a signed poster with a smooch, AND a meet and greet with the queens prior to the show.</p>
<p>$250 and higher: You will not only be reserved front-row seats, but you will also receive a personal invitation to our fundraiser, where a QUEEN will lip sync a song of your choice! In addition, you will get to meet the queens and you will receive a signed poster with a smooch as well as a personalized thank you note.</p>
<p>$1000 and higher: A personalized thank you note, a a signed poster with a smooch,  a meet and greet with the queens prior to the show, AND an executive producer title.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Don't have money to spare? We totally get it, neither do we. You can still:</p>
<p>- Volunteer a space for us to do auditions. We are looking for FREE spaces to hold our rehearsals as another means to cut down on costs. If you have a free room, let us know!</p>

<p><b>The Project </b></p>
<p>I’m honored to have been offered an artist residency at <a href=""http://muongstudio.vn/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Muong Studio</a> just west of Hanoi, Vietnam in November 2016, with the support of the Indochina Arts Partnership as the sponsoring agency. I’ll be working with local artisans to transform small compositions based on my “vines” series into large-scale sculptures made from local bamboo, an abundant and natural material in that region. I plan to experiment with both scale and material in creating these sculptures. There’s also a dialogue and a narrative within these works I’m looking to explore in the context of both the ethnic Muong culture as well as that of contemporary Vietnamese. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Another project I’ll be doing there builds on my recent experiences at residencies at MassMOCA (N. Adams, MA) and SpreadArt (Detroit). I’ll be creating a performance with Vietnamese choreographers and dancers. This will combine images of my artwork with movement, music, and culminating in a staged performance in the Hanoi area. Some of the bamboo sculptures may remain in Vietnam, and the performance will be for the benefit of their local community and cultural programs. For more on my recent work and how it relates to the forthcoming project, please visit <a href=""http://www.tabakart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my website</a>. </p>

<p>I was still in art school in NYC, barely out of high school when I found myself in uniform as a U.S. soldier in Vietnam. It was 1968 and while the protests back home against the war were growing, I was struggling to make sense of it all and survive. The level of destruction to the Vietnamese and to populations in adjoining countries was horrific. The loss of American lives and the experience has haunted me ever since. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It is both humbling and exciting to be able to return to Vietnam as an artist. It’s an amazing opportunity for reconciliation and starting a new journey. Several Vietnamese I met and connected with in developing this project have already extended their warm welcome to me, embracing my visit and collaborative art projects. I hope you’ll contribute to my effort and be part of this exchange of ideas and reconciliation. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469892385/Indie-sculpture_studies_behdjw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>What is needed and what you get</b></p>
<p>The funds raised in this campaign will help me with the costs of supplies and paying wages to local artisans who will assist in building the bamboo sculptures. The funds will also pay for a choreographer, dancers, and musicians for a performance in Hanoi. I’m also responsible for paying my travel, room and board at the residency and in Hanoi for up to six weeks to complete my goals. I hope to be able to hire a videographer to document the construction of the sculptures as well as to create a short film of the dance performance. Any additional funds raised beyond my expenses will stay in Vietnam to support the furthering of arts programs and cultural exchanges via the<a href=""www.indochinaartspartnership.org%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Indochina Arts Partnership</a>, a nonprofit with three decades of history working with Vietnamese artists. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470346806/1449002983592_qrejsx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">All donations from the $25 level and up will be rewarded with my recent artworks.

I’m honored to have been offered an artist residency at Muong Studio just west of Hanoi, Vietnam in November 2016, with the support of the Indochina Arts Partnership as the sponsoring agency. I’ll be working with local artisans to transform small compositions based on my “vines” series into large-scale sculptures made from local bamboo, an abundant and natural material in that region. I plan to experiment with both scale and material in creating these sculptures. There’s also a dialogue and a narrative within these works I’m looking to explore in the context of both the ethnic Muong culture as well as that of contemporary Vietnamese. 


Another project I’ll be doing there builds on my recent experiences at residencies at MassMOCA (N. Adams, MA) and SpreadArt (Detroit). I’ll be creating a performance with Vietnamese choreographers and dancers. This will combine images of my artwork with movement, music, and culminating in a staged performance in the Hanoi area. Some of the bamboo sculptures may remain in Vietnam, and the performance will be for the benefit of their local community and cultural programs. For more on my recent work and how it relates to the forthcoming project, please visit my website. 




Why Vietnam?
I was still in art school in NYC, barely out of high school when I found myself in uniform as a U.S. soldier in Vietnam. It was 1968 and while the protests back home against the war were growing, I was struggling to make sense of it all and survive. The level of destruction to the Vietnamese and to populations in adjoining countries was horrific. The loss of American lives and the experience has haunted me ever since. 


It is both humbling and exciting to be able to return to Vietnam as an artist. It’s an amazing opportunity for reconciliation and starting a new journey. Several Vietnamese I met and connected with in developing this project have already extended their warm welcome to me, embracing my visit and collaborative art projects. I hope you’ll contribute to my effort and be part of this exchange of ideas and reconciliation. What is needed and what you get
The funds raised in this campaign will help me with the costs of supplies and paying wages to local artisans who will assist in building the bamboo sculptures. The funds will also pay for a choreographer, dancers, and musicians for a performance in Hanoi. I’m also responsible for paying my travel, room and board at the residency and in Hanoi for up to six weeks to complete my goals. I hope to be able to hire a videographer to document the construction of the sculptures as well as to create a short film of the dance performance. Any additional funds raised beyond my expenses will stay in Vietnam to support the furthering of arts programs and cultural exchanges via the Indochina Arts Partnership, a nonprofit with three decades of history working with Vietnamese artists. All donations from the $25 level and up will be rewarded with my recent artworks. From photo art prints and silkscreen prints, to sculptures. Top reward levels include a selection of artwork, a tour of my Hudson Valley studio and meals for two at my home prepared by my wife, vegan cookbook author, Nava Atlas. If you’re planning to be in Hanoi while I’m there, dinner and a visit to the Muong Studios and local artists can be one of the perks for a contribution. 
Additional perks for other than the above list can be arranged through a studio visit. Contact Harry at Tabak@Tabakart.comHow you can helpPlease spread the word about this campaign to anyone you think may be interested. Forward the link via e-mail or post it to your social media. This fundraiser is flexible, which means that all contributions can be used for this project, even if the goal isn't reached. All contributors receive the perks offered. Any additional funds raised beyond the goal will benefit the arts community in Vietnam. Here's a sampling of some of the perks:",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>BECOMING A DISORIENTER</strong></h3>
<p>Disorient is a concept that takes you beyond ephemeral definitions and boxes of impermanent identities.  All possible definitions and labels that we are coming across on daily basis (related to place of birth, religion, gender, politics etc…) are not what definitions and labels say. Only our actions build our identity that has an ever-changing, spiraling nature.</p>
<p><br/><strong>What happens when we lose our perimeters, our orientating devices, our socio-cultural or emotional pillars?  How do we cope with facing an archetypal movement, a repetition that can entrance us so that we lose ground?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For Disorienters, loosing the ground of exterior perimeters is the coming back to one self, to the conscience of our own humanity. The spiraling movement and inter-connection of medias creates a vortex in which we encounter and mirror our essence. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHO ARE THE DISORIENTERS? </strong></h3>
<p>We are the two artists that create from this concept of healthy, creative disorientation and who invite YOU to become part of it in case you feel that you can identify with the concept.</p>

While she pursued her collaboration with vocal artist Yvon Bonenfant [B(earth), intimacies and Beacons were presented and/or exhibited in France, UK, Spain, Finland, Brazil, Slovakia…], “Wordless:”, her collaboration with contemporary and experimental composer Julius Fujak was exhibited in Italy, Slovakia and Spain. her work with British Choreographer Rosemary Lee the Suchness of Heni and Eddie has been released on DVD by ResCen and PARIP (http://www.rescen.net).
She also writes theoretical essays on Art and has published books with l’Harmattan in France and Palgrave-Macmillan in UK.

<p>Fractured- all female live art performance and skill sharing workshops.</p>
<p>Kinsukuroi is the Japanese art of applying gold or silver paint within the cracks of broken ceramics. It is believed that the object becomes more beautiful after it has been broken. Taking this idea as a metaphorical concept Fractured explores notions of the broken, the beautiful and the journey from one to the other. Fractured is a fully live, 1 hour long piece of performance art that has an entire album created for it.</p>
<p>Through our creative offering we hope to inspire and empower other humans (females especially!) to bring their art to this industry with confidence and a whole hearted understanding of just how vitally important these artworks are for our entire community.</p>
<p>We are asking for the financial support of just $5000 from our communities to breath life into this vision. So far in our individual creative journies we have always funded our projects ourselves. We are artists, mothers (7 children between us all!) and feminists and with financial support we can keep this collaboration moving forward and deliver performance art that is truly next level, also addressing the glaringly obvious gender inequality that exists within this industry. Statistics show that there hasn't been much of a shift in this issue in the last 20 years or so and we feel there is much to be gained from this creation and furthermore from activating skill sharing workshops for women to learn and collaborate.</p>
<p>Every single dollar you choose to donate will be received with such gratitude and will be poured directly into this vision. From the purchasing of much needed equipment to sublimation printing of artwork to fabric every single dollar will help us get there!</p>
<p>Fractured will debut early January 2017 with a performance evening that will showcase our collaboration and that of other female artists within the industry. Continuing on with a full Summer season of festival performances, workshops, forums and gigs with a view to tour our collaboration overseas in the second half of 2017.</p>
<p>We thank you in advance for your support and look forward to sharing this amazing and important creative immersion with you all as it unfolds.</p>

assez atypique.Pour avoir une ligne de conduite, j'ai décidé de me baser sur une partie de son enfance, il m'a tout de suite semblé évident d'élargir le projet et de trouver d'autres personnes pour réaliser cet exercice.Je n'avais pas d'attente mis a part de découvrir avec eux l'enfant qu'ils étaient, chaque personne m'a donné des pistes sur ce qu'allait devenir le film.Une thérapeute a guidé les interviews, Julie Lanvin et ce que nous avons découvert ensemble avec les premiers entretiens nous a surpris et a modifié le sens qu'allait prendre notre travail.Ce n'est pas simplement un documentaire car mon envie de mise en scène me pousse à y ajouter de la fiction, pour un rendu, je l'espère aussi esthétique qu'authentique Qui je suis? Je m'appel Lilly Evers, je suis une jeune comédienne de 24 ans, je vis actuellement sur Marseille.J'ai débuté mon expérience de comédienne à l'âge de 15 ans pour la compagnie de théâtre de Hervé Urbani, en corse puis à Metz.A 16 ans je suis partie faire des études de comédienne au Cours Florent.Lors d'un exercice dans le cadre de mes études, j'ai réalisé mon premier court métrage,« Elle et Lui », j'ai alors découvert une nouvelle passion pour l'image.Ayant toujours un fort attrait pour le jeu, à la fin de mon apprentissage au Cours Florent, je suis parti pour New York étudier avec le metteur en scène John Strasberg.A mon retour de New York, j'ai continué avec la réalisation de mon deuxième court-métrage,« Bombe » à Paris avec le photographe Pascal Gentil.Par la suite j'ai décidé de m'installer à Marseille, j'ai très vite fait la rencontre de L 'association Kino Fada qui m'a permis de réaliser trois courts-métrages, ""Modern reality"", ""Human contact"" ainsi que ""Time Off"".Renforcée par ces expériences j'ai alors décidé de me lancer dans la réalisation d'un projet plus conséquent avec le documentaire/fiction « Dans tes yeux » qui s'inscrit plus que jamais dans ma démarche artistique. Note d'intention Je m'intéresse énormément à notre fonctionnement en société, la façon dont nous nous comportons les uns envers les autres. Je me suis toujours questionnée sur qui nous somme au-delà de nos masques sociaux.Etant passionnée par la psychologie humaine, il m'a semblé logique de me baser sur l'enfance, celle-ci étant le point de départ de tous questionnements personnels.J'ai fait appel à Julie Lanvin, sophrologue, à qui j'ai confié la tâche de guider les interviews, nous avons utilisé ses connaissances de thérapeute pour ce tête à tête avec des inconnus face caméra.Je n'avais aucune attente, ce sont eux qui allaient me guider dans ce projet et non l'inverse.Ce que nous avons trouvé nous a dépassé car cela ne se résumait pas à l'idée classique du traumatisme d'un enfant mais au contraire à une soif de vie et à une lutte pour leurs soutiens personnels. Il en a résulté une forte sensation de connexion, comme si je reconnaissais quelque chose de moi en eux.Ces 9 personnes m’ont énormément inspiré et j’aimerais partager ce qu’ils m’ont apporté!Je fais appel à vous aujourd'hui car je voudrai finaliser ce projet comme il se doit, je veux lui donner la chance d'être. Parti pris de réalisation Je m'inscris dans une démarche de documentaire ponctué par des scènes de fictions qui ajouteront de l'esthétisme.Je souhaite également que les propos bruts soient mis en avant par l'intermédiaire de la photo et de la musique.Je travaillerais ainsi avec plusieurs cadreurs pour des raccords parfaits donnant une rythmique fluide aux scènes de fiction.Différents moyens de captation seront mis en place, utilisant autant des images de téléphone portable, appareil photo, caméra ainsi que drone.La musique aura également une place à part entière car je fais appel à des compositeurs pour que celle-ci soit complètement adaptée au film. EquipeRéalisation : Lilly EversCadre : Lilly Evers, Marielle dermerjian, David ChamakSon : Orphée szinetarMusique : Julien Grenaro, Sarah Krieg Avec la participation de Maïlyss PoherJonathan SaboureuxValérie BélouTouréGéraldine CabarotDavid ChamakFlavie Chêne du bois Budget 2000 eurosLocation matérielle 400 euros Envoi en festival+projection 250 euros Post production 350 euros Défraiement équipe 300 euros Pressage DVD 200 euros Musique originale 300 eurosCréation décor200 euros Si cependant le montant demandé venait à être dépassé, le projet connaîtra une promotion plus importante et une diffusion plus large. Vous pouvez suivre l'avancée du projet sur la page Facebook :https://www.facebook.com/lillyeverspro/?fref=ts Pour toute information complémentaire :Lilly Evers/réalisatrice : Lillyeversprod@gmail.com   ContrepartiePour 5 euros : un grand merci. Pour 10 euros : un grand merci, votre nom au générique Pour 15 euros : un grand merci, votre nom au générique plus lien privé vers le film. Pour 25 euros : un grand merci, votre nom au générique, lien privé vers le film plus une affiche du film. Pour 50 et plus : un grand merci + votre nom au générique + lien privé vers le film + affiche du film+ DVD+ invitation à la projection Pour 100 et plus : un grand merci + votre nom au générique + lien privé vers le film + affiche du film+ DVD + invitation à la projection du film+ lien vers des videos et photos inédites du tournage. Pour 200 et plus :Crédité en tant que coproducteur du filminvitation à la projectiontee-shirtDVD du film   Calendrier Novembre et décembre 2016Préparation tournageRecherche de financementsComposition de la musique originale avec Gaio et Sarah.Janvier 2017 Tournage Février 2017 montage et post-production.Mars 2017 projection du film au Variété à Marseille ainsi que d'autres lieux à venir.Juin 2017Envoi du film en festival Merci d'avance a chaque participant que ce soit en faisant un don ou en partageant le projet avec leurs réseaux!!!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our mission is to represent, present, promote, and sell work of local contemporary artists. As champions of free speech, we do not censor our artists’ work or written statements. We are dedicated to representing critical perspectives that challenge and illuminate our culture and enrich our aesthetic experience.Our History Founded by 8 artists in 2003, KLG is New Haven’s longest running retail gallery to date, though KLG has always been more than just a store. An outgrowth of the Westville-based arts renaissance, KLG has anchored such beloved local arts events as the Westville Artwalk, the Halloween Parade and the Holiday Open House. Additionally, KLG has hosted a wide breadth of public programming charged by the excitement of cross-disciplinary collaborations, including projects with musicians, theatre troupes, filmmakers and authors.Our VisionWith more than a decade under our belt, KLG is looking to an even brighter future. In addition to presenting monthly high-quality art exhibitions – always free and open to all – we will expand gallery programming with a robust schedule of free and low-cost community arts programs and events for children, young people, adults and families.Artists will lead monthly story-time events, family movie nights, portfolio review days, artist talks, workshops, demos and more. An apprenticeship program will be established for students seeking to gain experience in a retail gallery. We are also actively seeking out additional partnerships to activate the gallery in new and exciting ways and to offer more artists the opportunity to share in our space for creative expression. In the last several months, we have started to present our ideas to the community. The response has been overwhelmingly positive.Our Funding PlanTo produce this programming, KLG is partnering with the ArtEcon Initiative, a new neighborhood-based non-profit. We are thrilled to announce our team has been awarded a Mayor's Neighborhood Cultural Vitality Grant from the City of New Haven. This campaign is our next step. Funds will support: part-time Arts + Programming Coordinator ($4,500); artist honorariums ($3,350), free materials and supplies for program participants ($2,200,), outreach and marketing ($800), space use and occupancy ($4,150). Your donations will significantly contribute to our first year of community arts programming.Our PerksWe are offering some fantastic perks in exchange for your generous support. Artists have donated numerous artworks — many at bargain prices. In addition, our dedicated volunteers are offering curated brunches and cocktail parties at the gallery – all you have to do is show up! Please note: We welcome financial contributions in any amount.

Därför har jag nu ändrat den här kampanjen från att vara enbart på engelska till att bli dubbelspråkig, svenska och engelska, svengelska kanske man kan kalla det. Introduktionsvideon och kampanjnamnet Europe by Foot bibehålls dock på engelska.</p><p>De olika understöden du kan bidra med till höger och de ""perks"" (förmåner) du får i utbyte kan inte längre ändras språkligt, men du ser dem på svenska under rubriken För Dig längre ner här på sidan.</p><p><strong>Since the campaign has been running a bit slow I decided to change the setup, so it is now running in both Swedish and English, or in Swenglish, one may say.</strong></p><h2>Gräsrotsfinansiering – Ett enkelt sätt att stöda</h2><p>Eftersom många av er kanske inte är bekanta med gräsrotsfinansiering och hur man gör om man vill understöda ett projekt gjorde jag en kort video som visar hur det går till (se nedan).</p><p>Gräsrotsfinansiering ger vem som helst, som du och jag, möjlighet att bidra till att ett projekt kan förverkligas. Det är samtidigt ett sätt att kunna förverkliga projekt som kanske annars inte skulle bli av.</p><p>Alla summor är välkomna och bidrar till att göra vandringen möjlig, stora som små, inget är för smått och inget är för stort. Det är helt och hållet upp till dig vad du bidrar med om du vill vara med och förverkliga vandringen. Allt tas emot med tacksamhet och uppskattning!</p><p>Förutom de alternativ som finns till höger kan du också ge en helt valfri summa genom att klicka på BACK IT, fylla i summan och sedan klicka på Check Out, vilket tar dig till betalningssidan. Även här ingår förmåner, beroende på summans storlek.</p><p>På betalningssidan (gäller även dem som valt ett av de färdiga alternativen) fyller du i ditt namn, din e-postadress och leveransadress, vart du vill ha skickat de fysiska förmåner som ingår om du valt ett sådant alternativ, och till sist betalningsuppgifterna.</p><p>Vill du hellre understöda på något annat sätt går det också att ordna, bara skicka ett mejl åt mig på tom.sorhannus@gmail.com så kommer vi överens om hur det ska gå till.</p><p>Har du frågor om finansieringen och hur det går till att understöda får du också gärna mejla. Jag förstår att det kan vara knepigt att få grepp om det hela, och jag lär mig själv någonting nytt varje dag, så fråga gärna.</p><p>Det är bara tillsammans vi kan göra det här möjligt.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/kbB2TQOzRbM?ecver=1?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h2>Crowd Funding - A Simple Way to Contribute</h2><p><strong>Since many of you might not be familiar with crowd funding and how to contribute I made a short video on how it works.</strong></p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jAAKzgfdzw?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""><br/></iframe></div></div><h2>Målet / The Target</h2><p>Målet för kampanjen är satt till 5000 €, och når vi dit under maj månad kan den fortsätta utan avbrott ända till Gibraltar. Annars måste planen ändras. Det här kan enbart nås med DIN hjälp. Är du med och gör det möjligt?</p><p>Även om kampanjen går i Euro är det fullt möjligt att delta också från Sverige.</p><p><strong>The target for the campaign is set to 5000 €, and if we reach that level in may it can continue without interruption all the way to Gibraltar. Otherwise the plan will have to be changed. This is possible only with YOUR support. Will you participate in making it possible?</strong></p><h2>När och hur / When and Where</h2><p>Vandringen är tänkt att starta under juni månad 2017. Den börjar i Pjelax, Närpes och målet är Gibraltar, nästan så långt söderut man kan komma i Europa.</p><p>Distansen är uppskattningsvis drygt 4000 km, och beräknas ta ett halvår att genomföra. Det här är ändå inte ett äventyr för att bevisa något utan för att utforska, uppleva och uttrycka något, så tidtabellen är flexibel och flytande.</p><p><strong>The walk will get under way in June 2017. It will start in Narpes, a place known for its tomatoes and cucumbers, located in western Finland, and end in Gibraltar in the very south of Europe, on the border to Africa.</strong></p><p><strong>The distance is approximately 4000+ kilometers, and the estimated time to get it done is half a year. However this is not about perfoming to prove something, but performing to explore, experience and express something, so the time table is flexible and fleeting.</strong></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494272147/oxsekmszphm7owfooblc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2>Utforska, uppleva, uttrycka och skapa / Explore, Experience, Express and Share</h2><p>Jag kallar mig själv levnadskonstnär, vilket i praktiken betyder att utforska, uppleva, uttrycka och dela, och jag vill dela det här äventyret med dig. Det betyder att du kommer att kunna ta del av sådant som skapas under äventyret</p><p>...såsom texter, dikter, foton och videon.</p><p>Att vandra till fots är ett utmärkt sätt att utforska världen, både den yttre och den inre världen (vilka i verkligheten är en värld).</p><p>Det är också ett utmärkt sätt att uppleva det tidlösa och gränslösa. När man är där ute och vandrar försvinner både tid och gränser.</p><p>Att vandra och att skriva är två naturliga sätt för mig att ge uttryck för det som livet gett mig. På något sätt är vi alla konstnärer, och att dela med oss av våra naturliga gåvor och att växa som människor är allt vad det här livet egentligen handlar om.</p><p><strong>I call myself a life artist, which practically speaking means exploring, experiencing, expressing and sharing, and I want to share this adventure with you. That means you will be able to take part of creations coming up along the road, such as</strong></p><p><strong>...texts, poems, pictures and videos.</strong></p><p><strong>Walking by foot is an excellent way of exploring the world, both the outer world and the inner world, and it brings one close up to both these worlds (which in reality are one world).</strong></p><p><strong>It is also an excellent way to experience the timeless and boundless true reality, which we all are parts of.

Allt sant skapande, allt konstnärskap, handlar om att ge uttryck för livets djupare och högre dimensioner.</p><p>Videon nedan är på engelska, och innebörden är att det hela handlar om vår inneboende potential, om den inre kraften vi alla har och som driver allt samt om att upptäcka att den här jorden vi bor på är ett paradis.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/pkxhZqCpFQc?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p><strong>As every true creation this is not first and foremost about the one creating, but there is something bigger behind it. Running at the centre of this adventure and creation is what I call the 3 P´s.</strong></p><p><strong><u>The Human Potential</u>, inborn in everyone of us.</strong></p><p><strong><u>The Inner Power</u>, running through all of us, and being the driving force behind everything that is.</strong></p><p><strong><u>This Paradise</u>, that we are living in. Earth is a paradise, we just need to adjust our eyes and our vision to be able to see it.</strong></p><p><strong>Leading up to the fourth P - Peace.</strong></p><h2>Kul / Fun</h2><p>Naturligtvis handlar det här också om att ha kul. Varför annars göra något sådant här?</p><p>Kärlek, glädje och skratt är vad det mänskliga livet och mänskligt välmående är baserat på, och det är sådant vi alltid borde ha med oss.</p><p>Sant skapande är konstruktivt, och kommer ur en källa av kärlek och lekfullhet.</p><p>Livet självt är ett evigt pågående äventyr och skapande.</p><p><strong>Of course, this is also about having fun. Why otherwise do something like this?</strong></p><p><strong>Love, joy and laughter are the trinity of life, and should be with us in everything we do. They are the basic elements of human life and human wellbeing. Isn´t wellbeing something we are looking for in everything?</strong></p><p><strong>True creation is constructive, and comes out of love and fun.</strong></p><p><strong>Life itself is an ever ongoing funny adventure and creation.</strong></p><h2>Bakgrund / Background</h2><p>Idén till det här äventyret föddes under en vandring längs pilgrimsleden till Santiago de Compostela våren 2009. Det var där jag insåg att människor vandrat till fots genom Europa redan för hundratals år sedan, så jag tänkte...</p><p>...om de kunde göra det då, borde det vara möjligt att göra det i dag också.</p><p>Det var där ute på den spanska landsbygden jag verkligen fann det här med vandring och den känsla som kommer när man är där ute i det öppna, vidsträckta, eviga. Det är ett sätt att sakta ner och komma i kontakt med livets verkliga rytm, den som går från ögonblick till ögonblick, steg för steg.</p><p>Så sommaren 2011 startade jag en vandring som skulle ta mig från Närpes till Gibraltar, men den gången slutade vandringeni Saarbrücken i södra Tyskland med avsikten att någon dag fortsätta och fullfölja den.</p><p>Eftersom den nu aktuella vandringen är ett helt nytt projekt bestämde jag mig för att börja om från början och fullfölja vandringen på det sättet.</p><p>De tidigare vandringarna har fört det med sig att jag har en hyfsat bra uppfattning om vad som krävs för att kunna genomföra ett äventyr som det här.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494323390/giedvclnfnh9bkwxntzg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494323429/wjykotqpfuuo9pwzx98q.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>It is hard to point out exactly when all this started, probably when I was born, but the idea of this walk grew during a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Spain in the spring of 2009. I then realized that people had walked by foot across Europe hundreds of years ago, and I thought...</strong></p><p><strong>...if it was possible then it should be possible today.</strong></p><p><strong>The walk in Spain woke something in me, a dormant love for walking and nature and the open, free, eternal space one experiences when out there in our natural habitat. It is a way of slowing down and getting in touch with the true pace of life, which moves moment to moment, step by step.</strong></p><p><strong>So in 2011 I started a walk that would take me by foot from Narpes to Gibraltar, but I got only half way. It ended in Saarbrücken in southern Germany, but with an aim of some day continuing and fulfilling it.</strong></p><p><strong>This new walk is a way of completing something I started back then.</strong></p><p><strong>However, now those days feels like a distant memory, and since this is a completely new walk I decided to start it all over to make it a whole journey from the beginning.</strong></p><p><strong>Gibraltar being the destination because it is (almost) as far south as one can get on the mainland of Europe, and because I have been there once before and want to re-visit this cliff hanging out of the continent.</strong></p><p><strong>With this background I have a pretty good idea of what is required to do such a long-distance walk, although every walk is new, and every day is new so you never know what happens.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494323607/el4wwjj7hzczabmfmmji.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494323661/njzyzquqazrwh0kwgppm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2>Budgeten / The Budget</h2><p>Det finns två huvudsakliga utgifter i det här projektet, dels vandringen i sig själv och dels de böcker och annat som ska produceras och publiceras efteråt.</p><p>Om summan i kampanjen inte helt nås är planen ändå att komma iväg på vandringen, men den måste i sådana fall planeras om och eventuellt förkortas.</p><p>Det kommer också att vara möjligt att ge understöd under vandringens gång.</p><p>Har du inte möjlighet att understöda finansiellt finns det också andra sätt att göra det på, som att sprida budskapet om vandringen, och du kanske har någon egen idé hur du kan bidra.</p><p><strong>There are two main expdenditures for this project, one being the walk in itself and the second being the book(s) that will be produced and published after the walk.</strong></p><p><strong>If the targeted sum is not totally reached the plan is to still get off on a walk, if necessary a shorter version.</strong></p><p><strong>It will also be possible to contribute during the walk.</strong></p><p><strong>If you aren´t able to contribute financially there are other ways to do it, by spreading the word, or you may have your own idea of how you can contribute.

Därför har jag nu ändrat den här kampanjen från att vara enbart på engelska till att bli dubbelspråkig, svenska och engelska, svengelska kanske man kan kalla det. Introduktionsvideon och kampanjnamnet Europe by Foot bibehålls dock på engelska.De olika understöden du kan bidra med till höger och de ""perks"" (förmåner) du får i utbyte kan inte längre ändras språkligt, men du ser dem på svenska under rubriken För Dig längre ner här på sidan.Since the campaign has been running a bit slow I decided to change the setup, so it is now running in both Swedish and English, or in Swenglish, one may say.Gräsrotsfinansiering – Ett enkelt sätt att stödaEftersom många av er kanske inte är bekanta med gräsrotsfinansiering och hur man gör om man vill understöda ett projekt gjorde jag en kort video som visar hur det går till (se nedan).Gräsrotsfinansiering ger vem som helst, som du och jag, möjlighet att bidra till att ett projekt kan förverkligas. Det är samtidigt ett sätt att kunna förverkliga projekt som kanske annars inte skulle bli av.Alla summor är välkomna och bidrar till att göra vandringen möjlig, stora som små, inget är för smått och inget är för stort. Det är helt och hållet upp till dig vad du bidrar med om du vill vara med och förverkliga vandringen. Allt tas emot med tacksamhet och uppskattning!Förutom de alternativ som finns till höger kan du också ge en helt valfri summa genom att klicka på BACK IT, fylla i summan och sedan klicka på Check Out, vilket tar dig till betalningssidan. Även här ingår förmåner, beroende på summans storlek.På betalningssidan (gäller även dem som valt ett av de färdiga alternativen) fyller du i ditt namn, din e-postadress och leveransadress, vart du vill ha skickat de fysiska förmåner som ingår om du valt ett sådant alternativ, och till sist betalningsuppgifterna.Vill du hellre understöda på något annat sätt går det också att ordna, bara skicka ett mejl åt mig på tom.sorhannus@gmail.com så kommer vi överens om hur det ska gå till.Har du frågor om finansieringen och hur det går till att understöda får du också gärna mejla. Jag förstår att det kan vara knepigt att få grepp om det hela, och jag lär mig själv någonting nytt varje dag, så fråga gärna.Det är bara tillsammans vi kan göra det här möjligt.Crowd Funding - A Simple Way to ContributeSince many of you might not be familiar with crowd funding and how to contribute I made a short video on how it works.Målet / The TargetMålet för kampanjen är satt till 5000 €, och når vi dit under maj månad kan den fortsätta utan avbrott ända till Gibraltar. Annars måste planen ändras. Det här kan enbart nås med DIN hjälp. Är du med och gör det möjligt?Även om kampanjen går i Euro är det fullt möjligt att delta också från Sverige.The target for the campaign is set to 5000 €, and if we reach that level in may it can continue without interruption all the way to Gibraltar. Otherwise the plan will have to be changed. This is possible only with YOUR support. Will you participate in making it possible?När och hur / When and WhereVandringen är tänkt att starta under juni månad 2017. Den börjar i Pjelax, Närpes och målet är Gibraltar, nästan så långt söderut man kan komma i Europa.Distansen är uppskattningsvis drygt 4000 km, och beräknas ta ett halvår att genomföra. Det här är ändå inte ett äventyr för att bevisa något utan för att utforska, uppleva och uttrycka något, så tidtabellen är flexibel och flytande.The walk will get under way in June 2017. It will start in Narpes, a place known for its tomatoes and cucumbers, located in western Finland, and end in Gibraltar in the very south of Europe, on the border to Africa.The distance is approximately 4000+ kilometers, and the estimated time to get it done is half a year. However this is not about perfoming to prove something, but performing to explore, experience and express something, so the time table is flexible and fleeting. Utforska, uppleva, uttrycka och skapa / Explore, Experience, Express and ShareJag kallar mig själv levnadskonstnär, vilket i praktiken betyder att utforska, uppleva, uttrycka och dela, och jag vill dela det här äventyret med dig. Det betyder att du kommer att kunna ta del av sådant som skapas under äventyret...såsom texter, dikter, foton och videon.Att vandra till fots är ett utmärkt sätt att utforska världen, både den yttre och den inre världen (vilka i verkligheten är en värld).Det är också ett utmärkt sätt att uppleva det tidlösa och gränslösa. När man är där ute och vandrar försvinner både tid och gränser.Att vandra och att skriva är två naturliga sätt för mig att ge uttryck för det som livet gett mig. På något sätt är vi alla konstnärer, och att dela med oss av våra naturliga gåvor och att växa som människor är allt vad det här livet egentligen handlar om.I call myself a life artist, which practically speaking means exploring, experiencing, expressing and sharing, and I want to share this adventure with you. That means you will be able to take part of creations coming up along the road, such as...texts, poems, pictures and videos.Walking by foot is an excellent way of exploring the world, both the outer world and the inner world, and it brings one close up to both these worlds (which in reality are one world).It is also an excellent way to experience the timeless and boundless true reality, which we all are parts of. When you are out there walking time and borders simply disappear.Walking and writing are two natural ways for me to let life express itself. In some way we are all artists, and sharing our natural gifts and growing as humans is really what this life is all about.För Dig / For YouGräsrotsfinansiering handlar inte bara om att ge understöd, utan det är ett utbyte så du får också något tillbaka.Först och främst kommer du med ditt understöd att göra äventyret möjligt, och därmed kunna följa det och ta del av sådant som skapas under resans gång, texter, dikter, foton, videon, och allt det här kommer att finnas tillgängligt på bloggentomsorhannus.life...och via sociala medier.Ge 5 € eller mera och du hjälper till att göra det hela möjligt och kan följa det.Ge 10 € eller mera och få ett signerat digitalt tack kort.Ge 20 € eller mera och få ett signerat fysiskt tack kort sänt hem till dig.Ge 30 € eller mera och få en e-bok från resan + ett signerat digitalt tack kort.Ge 60 € eller mera och få en inbunden bok från resan + ett signerat fysiskt tack kort.Ge 100 € eller mera och få en inbunden bok från resan + en extra mindre bok + ett signerat fysiskt tack kort.Ge 150 € eller mera och få 2 inbundna böcker + en extra mindre bok + ett signerat fysiskt tack kort.Alla de här tack korten och böckerna har en uppskattad leveranstid i maj/juni 2018, men det här är väldigt preliminärt och kan förändras.Det kommer också att vara möjligt att ge understöd under resans gång.Notera att det tillkommer en avgift för frakt på 5 € inom EU och 10 € resten av världen för de fysiska böckerna. Det här för att täcka en del av fraktkostnaderna.Crowd funding is not only about contributions, it is an exchange.What´s then in it for you? First of all you will be able to follow the journey through the blog tomsorhannus.life and through social media and take part of what is created along the road, such as texts, poems, pictures, videos and so on.This will all be avaliable to you for free, but by supporting the journey and contributing to it and make it happen there is more in it for you.Pledge 5 € or more and Be able to follow itPledge 10 € or more and get A signed digital thank you card.Pledge 20 € or more and get A signed physical thank you card sent to you.Pledge 30 € or more and get an E-book from the journey + A signed digital thank you card.Pledge 60 € or more and get A hardcover book from the journey + A signed physical thank you cardPledge 100 € or more and get A hardcover book + A special small book (physical) + A signed physical thank you cardPledge 150 € or more and get 2 hardcover books + A special small book (physical) + A signed physical thank you cardThe estimated delivery dates for the perks (see list to the right) are at this point very preliminary, and may change.It will also be possible to contribute during the walk.Note: there will be a shipping fee of 5 € in the EU and 10 € in the rest of the world added to the physical books, to cover some of the shipping costsThe 3 P´sDet här äventyret handlar inte om mig, utan det är ett sätt att ge uttryck för något större. Allt sant skapande, allt konstnärskap, handlar om att ge uttryck för livets djupare och högre dimensioner.Videon nedan är på engelska, och innebörden är att det hela handlar om vår inneboende potential, om den inre kraften vi alla har och som driver allt samt om att upptäcka att den här jorden vi bor på är ett paradis.As every true creation this is not first and foremost about the one creating, but there is something bigger behind it. Running at the centre of this adventure and creation is what I call the 3 P´s.The Human Potential, inborn in everyone of us.The Inner Power, running through all of us, and being the driving force behind everything that is.This Paradise, that we are living in. Earth is a paradise, we just need to adjust our eyes and our vision to be able to see it.Leading up to the fourth P - Peace.Kul / FunNaturligtvis handlar det här också om att ha kul. Varför annars göra något sådant här?Kärlek, glädje och skratt är vad det mänskliga livet och mänskligt välmående är baserat på, och det är sådant vi alltid borde ha med oss.Sant skapande är konstruktivt, och kommer ur en källa av kärlek och lekfullhet.Livet självt är ett evigt pågående äventyr och skapande.Of course, this is also about having fun. Why otherwise do something like this?Love, joy and laughter are the trinity of life, and should be with us in everything we do. They are the basic elements of human life and human wellbeing. Isn´t wellbeing something we are looking for in everything?True creation is constructive, and comes out of love and fun.Life itself is an ever ongoing funny adventure and creation.Bakgrund / BackgroundIdén till det här äventyret föddes under en vandring längs pilgrimsleden till Santiago de Compostela våren 2009. Det var där jag insåg att människor vandrat till fots genom Europa redan för hundratals år sedan, så jag tänkte......om de kunde göra det då, borde det vara möjligt att göra det i dag också.Det var där ute på den spanska landsbygden jag verkligen fann det här med vandring och den känsla som kommer när man är där ute i det öppna, vidsträckta, eviga. Det är ett sätt att sakta ner och komma i kontakt med livets verkliga rytm, den som går från ögonblick till ögonblick, steg för steg.Så sommaren 2011 startade jag en vandring som skulle ta mig från Närpes till Gibraltar, men den gången slutade vandringeni Saarbrücken i södra Tyskland med avsikten att någon dag fortsätta och fullfölja den.Eftersom den nu aktuella vandringen är ett helt nytt projekt bestämde jag mig för att börja om från början och fullfölja vandringen på det sättet.De tidigare vandringarna har fört det med sig att jag har en hyfsat bra uppfattning om vad som krävs för att kunna genomföra ett äventyr som det här.It is hard to point out exactly when all this started, probably when I was born, but the idea of this walk grew during a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Spain in the spring of 2009. I then realized that people had walked by foot across Europe hundreds of years ago, and I thought......if it was possible then it should be possible today.The walk in Spain woke something in me, a dormant love for walking and nature and the open, free, eternal space one experiences when out there in our natural habitat. It is a way of slowing down and getting in touch with the true pace of life, which moves moment to moment, step by step.So in 2011 I started a walk that would take me by foot from Narpes to Gibraltar, but I got only half way. It ended in Saarbrücken in southern Germany, but with an aim of some day continuing and fulfilling it.This new walk is a way of completing something I started back then.However, now those days feels like a distant memory, and since this is a completely new walk I decided to start it all over to make it a whole journey from the beginning.Gibraltar being the destination because it is (almost) as far south as one can get on the mainland of Europe, and because I have been there once before and want to re-visit this cliff hanging out of the continent.With this background I have a pretty good idea of what is required to do such a long-distance walk, although every walk is new, and every day is new so you never know what happens.Budgeten / The BudgetDet finns två huvudsakliga utgifter i det här projektet, dels vandringen i sig själv och dels de böcker och annat som ska produceras och publiceras efteråt.Om summan i kampanjen inte helt nås är planen ändå att komma iväg på vandringen, men den måste i sådana fall planeras om och eventuellt förkortas.Det kommer också att vara möjligt att ge understöd under vandringens gång.Har du inte möjlighet att understöda finansiellt finns det också andra sätt att göra det på, som att sprida budskapet om vandringen, och du kanske har någon egen idé hur du kan bidra.There are two main expdenditures for this project, one being the walk in itself and the second being the book(s) that will be produced and published after the walk.If the targeted sum is not totally reached the plan is to still get off on a walk, if necessary a shorter version.It will also be possible to contribute during the walk.If you aren´t able to contribute financially there are other ways to do it, by spreading the word, or you may have your own idea of how you can contribute. Just remember if you do it online to use the Indiegogo share tools.Vägen / The RoadDet här är ingen asketisk vandring och inte heller en vandring i ren vildmark. Den kommer att gå längs landsbygden, men också genom byar och städer, och jag kommer att använda mig av bekvämligheter för till exempel mat och övernattning.Jag kommer att ha med mig ett tält och en sovsäck samt en hängmatta, men jag kommer också att tillbringa nätter under tak. Jag bestämmer från dag till dag hur det blir.This is not an ascetic walk and it is not a walk in real wilderness. It will go on the countryside and along lonely roads, but it will also go through populated areas, villages, towns and cities, and I will use comforts (for food and sleep) along the road.Some parts may go along walking trails, but the main part will go along ordinary roads, preferably smaller ones, bicycle paths and similar. This means I will have to find my own overnight stays, and other conveniences.I will carry with me a tent and a sleeping bag, and a hammock, but I will also spend nights under roofs, and I decide from day to day how I spend the nights. Övrigt / MoreDet finns naturligtvis inga garantier för att det här projektet kommer att lyckas. Allt kan hända i det här äventyret vi kallar livet, men det finns ingen orsak att oroa sig på förhand eller att måla upp problem. Situationer i livet är till för att genomlevas, och ibland händer det att vi helt enkelt tvingas ändra riktning. Det kan jag i alla fall lova, att jag kommer att göra mitt bästa för att uppfylla det här äventyret.Kom ihåg att den här presentationen bara är ett litet, litet frö, som innehåller så mycket, mycket mera, om vi får det att gro och växa. Det kan bli en vacker planta med njutbara frukter.Så genom att understöda vandringen hjälper du fröet att gro och växa, och du blir en del av det här ävetyret som kallas Europe by Foot.Tiden för kampanjen är ganska kort så agera snabbt, och sprid gärna budskapet om den.Tack för att du tagit dig tid att läsa det här och om du bestämmer dig för att bidra och göra äventyret möjligt är jag väldigt tacksam! Alla bidrag räknas, stora som små.Of course there is no guarantee that this project will succeed. Anything can happen in this adventure we call life, but there is no reason to worry or paint pictures of negativity beforehand. Situations are there to be lived through, and sometimes it just happens that we have to change our direction, but one thing I can assure you, I will do the best I can to fulfill this creation.I know there will be days with rain, I know there will be days with sun, I know there will be hard days, and I know there will be days with fun. I know I sometimes will be lost, but I also know that most of the time I will find my way.Remember that this presentation is just a tiny, tiny, tiny small seed, and it contains so much, much, much more if we get it to sprout and grow.It can become a beautiful plant, with tasty fruits.So by contributing you will be a part of making it grow, and be a part of this adventure called Europe by Foot.Note that the campaign running up to the project is pretty short, so act fast.And spread the word about it around you and over the world.Thank you for taking your time to read this and if you want to contribute and make the journey possible I am very grateful!

The owner of the Babes received notice that the venue was shutting down in 24 hours and that all shows and events anyone, including the Babes, had planned were canceled. Which forced us to have to cancel our end-of-the-year event because we did not have the funds to pay another venue in less than two weeks.                (On the bright side we got to do our Christmas show)Ms. Laveau's Snow Wonders belly danceWe lost:
Venue 
PA System 
Money 
Planned Events 
Some of the Babes props 
We Gained
New followers/Fans
Venue
Hope 
We were able to find a new venue that would allow us to book a few dates to perform in 2017 but we no longer have a PA system for our music. A prop that was gifted to us from an audience member was ""lost"" from the old venue. We also lost donated money (part of an agreement to perform at the venue) and dates that were tied to the old venue. (We love to pull people on stage with us) Our first Burlesque show is in February and we are hoping with the love and support from our community, fans, and family, that we Babes will be able to reach our goal-if not more. We are not asking for a lot just enough so we can get back what we lost and improve what we already have. We need:
Portable PA system with mic (we have beautiful singers)
Replace our props
Wood
Paint
 Things we need to improve:  
Wardrobe 
 Curtains
 Props
Ms. Kitten loves to singHow can you do all that with so little?                         (The owner is the queen of getting good deals)We know how to function with what we have but we don't want our audience and fans to suffer. Sure we can hook up a laptop to some computer speakers and hope for the best but we would be compromising the quality of what we give at our shows and we do not want to go down that route. We are not looking for a brand new 2017 PA system. We just need something that will sound amazing for a good price (Thank you Amazon & Ebay) and will last us for a while.We could not recreate the lovely silhouette tease that Ms. Cyber and Miss Lust performed for the Christmas show again. They and the other babes had a lot of plans for that prop in future shows.  Even though it was a gift we can probably fine another one or make one. It just wont be the same because it was a gift.  Ms. Cyber and Miss Lust silhouette strip tease Our new venue, is new and it needs a little TLC and us babes always help out in anyway we can in support of the people who help us. Which is why we need wood and paint to build stairs and an extension for the stage. It wouldn't be only for us babes to use but for anyone who uses that venue space. (It's hard stepping up on a high stage with no stairs in 4 inch heels) We love our curtains but we have been trying to raise money on our own at shows but venue expenses and other things have kept us from meeting the goal of fixing the curtains. (Do not let a short person measure curtains they will come out short, true story.) We are just trying to extend the curtains so they reach the floor and fix one completely.  Ms. Gunz and her acrobatic skills Wardrobe and props go hand in hand. We raid each others closets and our wardrobe artist's closet to put together our looks for shows. We have a lot of amazing theme shows but only so little wardrobe.

<p>Hello my name is David Graziano. I am an industrial designer and entrepreneur. I spent the last 25 years of my life designing hospitality venues and businesses. I have a love for sculpting and my passion is centered around creating concepts for people to enjoy. Burningman has had a very strong impact on my desires to contribute to the art world. What I find most interesting about the art at Burningman is the ability to share it with so many people on an interactive platform. Balanceville was an idea that started nine years ago.</p>
<p>The original concept was to build a beautiful art car that could move across the playa and raise way into the air giving its guest a different perspective of the playa and BM. So I set out on a quest to purchase the largest scissor lift available and began developing a sort of Willy Wonka Dr. Seuss sleigh that could carry people into the sky.</p>
<p>The process has been evolving over eight years.  Ninety-five percent (95%) of all the metal used for Balanceville has been hand bent without the use of heavy machines.  Balanceville has been a sculpture project that is constantly evolving each year it returns to the playa. After five years of driving Balanceville with its original scissor lifts chassis at a painstakingly slow speed of 2 miles an hour, I decided we needed to incorporate a new vehicle with the scissor lift that would allow Balanceville to drive the speed limit of 5 miles an hour on the playa. This new idea of merging the scissor lift with another vehicle was also designed to allow Balanceville to pack up and be street legal on the highway, thus saving thousands of dollars in transportation each year. So my great friend Tom Toulec, who has been helping me build the car from its inception, suggested using a fire engine truck chassis. This was absolutely perfect, the fire engine truck already comes with its hydraulics, as well as, a chassis designed to hold large amount of weight. So three years ago, we purchased a 1990 fire engine truck. We completely dismantled the fire engine truck and cut the back axle so we could drop the scissor lift crane into the mainframe of the fire engine truck making both vehicles into one vehicle. The following three years of this large mechanical undertaking has been a sculpture project to change the frame of the original fire truck into a completely new vehicle that will complement Balanceville's original sleigh frame. The result has been incredibly rewarding. Balanceville now has a portion of the Vehicle which raises 52 feet into the air, and then once lowered, it nests perfectly into the base chassis, creating an illusion, when down, that the car is just one vehicle.</p>
<p>Balanceville is a project designed to deliver an incredibly unique experience to every guest who boards vehicle. Myself and the few very dear friends of mine have been building Balanceville every year since 2009. We have put a lot of love and care into building Balanceville with the hope that each year at Burningman we can inspire, and share many magical experiences with the beautiful people of the playa. I have personally witnessed so many incredible moments of joy over these past seven years of attendance at the Burn. There have been weddings on Balanceville, engagements, first kisses, jaw-dropping facial expressions, and many other amazing emotions from the view atop.  Many people who enter the vehicle for the first time are completely unaware that the sleigh portion of the vehicle raises five stories in the air. It isn't until after a very slow movement upward, that the guests begins to realize that they have changed their altitude as the sleigh portion of the vehicle slowly rises. I believe very much in the power of art and how art can be so inspirational. Balanceville's goal is to capture the imagination of anybody who encounters the vehicle through its whimsical and playful design. Balanceville and its hard-working team members want to see your smile, your joy while you rise above the playa for a view of like no other, come ride with us at Burning Man 2018.</p>
<p>Education teachersIt's been an amazing educational  journey building Balanceville. Constructing an art car of this size with so many mechanical parts does not come without its challenges. Just to store and move Balanceville safely each year is quite a large undertaking. When we first started building Balanceville we took off 1600 pounds of steel that was the railing and steel plate floor for the lift. Next we were going to build a new decorative frame made up of steel tubing to replace the factory steel railing and extended floor plate. One of the challenges was that we were going to redistribute the weight on the lift. We had to make sure that we balanced the sides, as well as, so that we did not create an uneven weight distribution for the lift, which can lift about 15 people at a time. There is a tremendous amount of safety awareness that needs to constantly be thought of while building Balanceville.  Every piece of metal we add to the vehicle we need to calculate its shape and weight distribution so that we don’t offset the vehicles balance. It's hard to explain in words how many parts both sculptural and mechanical need to be taken apart and put back together each year for the vehicle to be ready and safe for the playa. The good news is the team that has been working on Balanceville has been the same team for most of its life.  This certainly helps with all aspects of operating and building Balanceville. Just to pack the vehicle up from its workshop to the time it gets fully assembled at Burningman is about two weeks with four people working around the clock.</p>
<p>Now that Balanceville is a 52-foot scissor lift and a full-size fire engine truck chassis, its home during the months between Burningman needs to be a large enough space to work on the vehicle.  So obviously the cost associated with just storing, maintaining and operating the vehicle during Burningman has become a large responsibility and expense each year. This does not include the expense of finishing Balanceville’s decorative framework each year, which we hope to finish in the next two years.

</div></div>","Hello my name is David Graziano. I am an industrial designer and entrepreneur. I spent the last 25 years of my life designing hospitality venues and businesses. I have a love for sculpting and my passion is centered around creating concepts for people to enjoy. Burningman has had a very strong impact on my desires to contribute to the art world. What I find most interesting about the art at Burningman is the ability to share it with so many people on an interactive platform. Balanceville was an idea that started nine years ago.
The original concept was to build a beautiful art car that could move across the playa and raise way into the air giving its guest a different perspective of the playa and BM. So I set out on a quest to purchase the largest scissor lift available and began developing a sort of Willy Wonka Dr. Seuss sleigh that could carry people into the sky.
The process has been evolving over eight years.  Ninety-five percent (95%) of all the metal used for Balanceville has been hand bent without the use of heavy machines.  Balanceville has been a sculpture project that is constantly evolving each year it returns to the playa. After five years of driving Balanceville with its original scissor lifts chassis at a painstakingly slow speed of 2 miles an hour, I decided we needed to incorporate a new vehicle with the scissor lift that would allow Balanceville to drive the speed limit of 5 miles an hour on the playa. This new idea of merging the scissor lift with another vehicle was also designed to allow Balanceville to pack up and be street legal on the highway, thus saving thousands of dollars in transportation each year. So my great friend Tom Toulec, who has been helping me build the car from its inception, suggested using a fire engine truck chassis. This was absolutely perfect, the fire engine truck already comes with its hydraulics, as well as, a chassis designed to hold large amount of weight. So three years ago, we purchased a 1990 fire engine truck. We completely dismantled the fire engine truck and cut the back axle so we could drop the scissor lift crane into the mainframe of the fire engine truck making both vehicles into one vehicle. The following three years of this large mechanical undertaking has been a sculpture project to change the frame of the original fire truck into a completely new vehicle that will complement Balanceville's original sleigh frame. The result has been incredibly rewarding. Balanceville now has a portion of the Vehicle which raises 52 feet into the air, and then once lowered, it nests perfectly into the base chassis, creating an illusion, when down, that the car is just one vehicle.
Balanceville is a project designed to deliver an incredibly unique experience to every guest who boards vehicle. Myself and the few very dear friends of mine have been building Balanceville every year since 2009. We have put a lot of love and care into building Balanceville with the hope that each year at Burningman we can inspire, and share many magical experiences with the beautiful people of the playa. I have personally witnessed so many incredible moments of joy over these past seven years of attendance at the Burn. There have been weddings on Balanceville, engagements, first kisses, jaw-dropping facial expressions, and many other amazing emotions from the view atop.  Many people who enter the vehicle for the first time are completely unaware that the sleigh portion of the vehicle raises five stories in the air. It isn't until after a very slow movement upward, that the guests begins to realize that they have changed their altitude as the sleigh portion of the vehicle slowly rises. I believe very much in the power of art and how art can be so inspirational. Balanceville's goal is to capture the imagination of anybody who encounters the vehicle through its whimsical and playful design. Balanceville and its hard-working team members want to see your smile, your joy while you rise above the playa for a view of like no other, come ride with us at Burning Man 2018.
Education teachersIt's been an amazing educational  journey building Balanceville. Constructing an art car of this size with so many mechanical parts does not come without its challenges. Just to store and move Balanceville safely each year is quite a large undertaking. When we first started building Balanceville we took off 1600 pounds of steel that was the railing and steel plate floor for the lift. Next we were going to build a new decorative frame made up of steel tubing to replace the factory steel railing and extended floor plate. One of the challenges was that we were going to redistribute the weight on the lift. We had to make sure that we balanced the sides, as well as, so that we did not create an uneven weight distribution for the lift, which can lift about 15 people at a time. There is a tremendous amount of safety awareness that needs to constantly be thought of while building Balanceville.  Every piece of metal we add to the vehicle we need to calculate its shape and weight distribution so that we don’t offset the vehicles balance. It's hard to explain in words how many parts both sculptural and mechanical need to be taken apart and put back together each year for the vehicle to be ready and safe for the playa. The good news is the team that has been working on Balanceville has been the same team for most of its life.  This certainly helps with all aspects of operating and building Balanceville. Just to pack the vehicle up from its workshop to the time it gets fully assembled at Burningman is about two weeks with four people working around the clock.
Now that Balanceville is a 52-foot scissor lift and a full-size fire engine truck chassis, its home during the months between Burningman needs to be a large enough space to work on the vehicle.  So obviously the cost associated with just storing, maintaining and operating the vehicle during Burningman has become a large responsibility and expense each year. This does not include the expense of finishing Balanceville’s decorative framework each year, which we hope to finish in the next two years. The support we are looking for this year is not for the sculptural part the car. That expense is being covered by myself and a few friends. The financial support we’re looking for is just to cover the cost of storage, maintenance, transportation, and for its operational team during Burningman.
In the end, it is important for me to express my immense joy for this yearly project.  After sharing experiences on the car, I find it really gratifying to say, at the end of each Burningman, three things that usually don’t go together - “I’ve never spent so much money, worked so hard, and been so satisfied all at the same time.”",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Looky Here Art Space: Community Risograph </h3>
<p>Looky Here is a multi-functional Art space serving the community of Western Massachusetts and Southern Vermont. We support artists living in the community by providing affordable used and donated art supplies and music equipment. Our programming, including workshops, events and gallery shows seeks to cultivate interest and appreciation of the arts, as well as build skills, confidence and relationships needed to sustain a creative life.</p>
<p>Part of our mission is to host equipment in our space that provides artists access to mediums which otherwise require a large investment. In response to expressed interest, we are planning a collective rental of a Risograph printing machine, which visual artists and bookmakers revere for its high quality image reproduction. Risos are dynamic art making machines, and we polan to host workshops by expert Riso-artists, as well as train and pay a monitor to help people use the Riso during open hours. This project will serve the artists in a 50 mile radius of Greenfield by offering access to a high quality art and book reproduction, and providing space for artists to meet, exchange and collaborate.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Risograph:</h3>
<p>A Risograph printer is an affordable, eco-friendly digital duplicator that works in a similar way to a xerox printer but produces an image closer to a screenprint. Risograph is a form of Mimeograph printing, which utilizes a rotating ink filled drum that lays an impression onto a piece of paper. Riso prints individual colors at a time using a rice bran oil based ink, which produces a monotone image that can include values. Multi-color prints are made by sending the paper through the machine multiple times and switching out the ink drum, when the colors overlap the translucency of the ink blends together to produce wider range of color options. Riso comes in a variety of color options that will blend and layer to turn your image into a beautiful art print.</p>
<p>After purchasing an old broken model, we are now interested in leasing a new SF5130 duplicator from Riso Inc. in Boston. This model features:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 different color drums (which must be changed between prints)</li>
<li>scanning bed with job/color seperation functions</li>
<li>ability to print 130 copies per minuite</li>
<li>ability to print 13lb to 110lb paper including: paper stocks, construction paper, newsprint, postcards and envelopes frpm 4""x6"" to 8.5""x 14""</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Financing Plan</h3>
<p>The Risograph costs $187.29 per month to lease. This includes the first 4 color drums and roll of masters. We estimate that our annual expense for the machine, and new inks and masters would total <strong>$2,400.</strong></p>
<p>While Looky Here is currently run by the Board of Directors on a volunteer basis, it is part of our mission to employ area artists. To hire one staff member to run the Risograph, as well as work our resale store, for 7 hours a day, 5 days a week at $15 an hour, we would need to ensure<strong> $30,000 </strong>for their annual stipend.</p>
<p>This means that we hope to be pulling in about <strong>$2,700 a month</strong>.</p>
<p>While we plan to take custom orders for a fee, our vision is to create a community of artists who all have access to unlimited printing. This would mean creating a membership program that would divide and share the cost of leasing and staffing the Community Risograph. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>IMPORTANT NOTE FOR INTERESTED MEMBERS!</h3>
<p>Membership has potential to work in many ways, and as investors in this Community Risograph project, your input on membership plans is important, as we are trying to make this as affordable as possible. While paying a staff member is one of our long term goals, we recognize the strain it puts on the membership fee, and our Board is willing to continue to volunteer, as well as accept volunteer work to make this happen.</p>
<p>The monthly or annual membership fee will differ depending on how many members enroll. </p>
<p>At <strong>$2,700 a month, </strong>including the employee stipend:</p>
<p>the monthly membership fee would be <strong>$54, </strong>if 50 members join.</p>
<p>However, if 25 members join, the monthly fee would be <strong>$108</strong></p>
<p><b>To understand if leasing the Risograph will be a financially stable investment for Looky Here, we are asking potential members to contribute to the cost of an annual membership if possible. </b></p>
<p>If membership is desired, pease specify in your donation comments, and we will calculate the cost divided by members once our monetary goal is met, and make up the difference if necessary.   </p>

     We are a team of recent converts to the mind-blowing experience that is Burning Man.  After participating in the festival largely as spectators last year, We feel deeply inspired to bring the most important, moving work we can to share with the many 100,000's of individuals that make up this creative, global community.
What is our campaign about?
Our campaign is about bringing Sacred Space to Burning Man this year to enhance the theme of ""Radical Ritual"".  We hope to touch thousands of lives in a way that will inspire individuals to stop and consider what they truly are ""Here to do"" on our little, shared planet.
What your financial help means to us:
Your contribution, in whatever amount, will give us the funds we need to transport this 11oolb sculpture cross-country and build a meaningful, sacred space in which it may be experienced.  
What is our Campaign Goal and where will the money go?

We have set a goal of $4300!  Your contribution will go towards:
*3 week Rental of a Heavy duty towing vehicle to haul 5,000 pounds of pure Messenger Shrine love across the country and back! ~$1850
 *Gas to Power this Tow Vehicle (yes, we know--not a zero-carbon footprint campaign here unfortunately)  ~$1100

<h2>I mille volti di San Nicola</h2>
<p>Bari è la città di San Nicola. Qui, dal 1087, si trovano le sue reliquie che ancora oggi richiamano devoti da tutto il mondo. Portano il suo nome chiese, strade, quartieri, strutture d’ogni tipo, perfino lo stadio cittadino. Eppure molti baresi sembrano non conoscere del tutto l’identità del loro santo patrono. Anche fuori dalla città, sono pochi quelli che collegano la figura di San Nicola a quella di Santa Claus, il santo più famoso del mondo. Il vescovo di Myra, nell’attuale Turchia, divenuto nei secoli protettore dei commercianti, dei marinai, dei farmacisti, dei sarti, dei birrai e di innumerevoli altre categorie, è sempre stato prima di tutto protettore degli innocenti e, in particolare, dei bambini. È questo che ha permesso al suo culto di diffondersi ovunque, sopravvivendo a riforme, controriforme e rivoluzioni. Questo ci ha spinto a dar vita, nel 2014, alla Fondazione Myrabilia, per la promozione di attività culturali/pedagogiche incentrate sulla figura del Santo dei Bambini. La nascita del MUMBAM, rappresenta una tappa fondamentale del nostro progetto: dotare la nostra città di una mostra-museo-laboratorio permanente, interamente dedicata a San Nicola dei Bambini.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>The many faces of Saint Nicholas</i></h3>
<p><i>Bari is the city of San Nicola, and it is here, ever since 1087, that his relics have been attracting devotees from all over the world. Churches, streets, neighborhoods, various types of facilities and even the city’s football stadium have all been named after him. Yet many people from Bari don’t even seem to know exactly who their patron saint was. And even outside the city, few people connect the figure of St. Nicholas to that of Santa Claus, the most famous saint in the world. The bishop of Myra, in modern-day Turkey, who over the centuries became the protector of traders, sailors, pharmacists, tailors, brewers and countless other categories, was always mainly a protector of the innocent – and of children in particular. That is what led to him having devotees worldwide, surviving various reforms, counter-reforms and revolutions. And that is also what led us, in 2014, to set up the Myrabilia Foundation, to promote cultural and educational activities around the figure of the Children’s Saint. Founding MUMBAM was a key step in our plan to give our city a permanent exhibition-museum-workshop, entirely dedicated to St. Nicholas and the Children.</i></p>

<h2>Che cosa otterrai sostenendo il MUNBAM? </h2>
<p>Fare una donazione al donatore per antonomasia non è certo un’occasione che capita tutti i giorni. Anche perché San Nicola non ama essere ricompensato in alcun modo per la sua generosità, che è per definizione anonima e gratuita. Ce lo ricorda uno specifico episodio della sua vita, dal quale deriva il simbolo delle tre sfere dorate. Ognuna di esse rappresenta infatti il dono fatto dal Santo alle tre figlie di un padre caduto in miseria. Per tre notti Nicola, erede di una grande ricchezza, gettò di nascosto nella loro in casa un sacco di monete d’oro. Ciascuna delle fanciulle ebbe così la dote per maritarsi, sfuggendo alla miseria e alla prostituzione. Scoperto dal padre ansioso di ringraziare il suo benefattore, San Nicola gli fece giurare di mantenere il segreto finché fosse rimasto in vita. Nacque così la figura del misterioso dispensatore di doni che s’intrufola nottetempo nelle case per fare felici i bambini. Per essere coerenti con i suoi principi, <strong>non ti offriremo alcun vantaggio tangibile</strong> in cambio del tuo sostegno al MUNBAM. Possiamo invece dirti quel che diventerai: un aiutante di San Nicola in piena regola, con tanto di attestato che ti verrà consegnato dall’associazione Myrabilia. E insieme a questo, naturalmente, riceverai un immenso grazie da parte nostra, dei piccoli e grandi visitatori del MUNBAM e in ultimo, ma non per ultimo, di San Nicola o, se preferisci, di Babbo Natale.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>What will you get by supporting MUNBAM? </i></h3>
<p><i>Donating to the donor par excellence is certainly not an opportunity you get every day. That’s also true because St. Nicholas doesn’t like being rewarded in any way for his generosity, which is by definition anonymous and gratuitous. There is a specific episode from his life that reminds us of this, and was the origin of the three golden spheres he is associated with. Each sphere represents the gift which Nicholas gave to the three daughters of a man who had fallen on hard times. For three nights, Nicholas, who was heir to great wealth, secretly threw a bag of gold coins into their home. Each of the girls thus had a dowry to get married with, thus escaping poverty and prostitution. Discovered by their father, who couldn’t wait to thank his benefactor, St. Nicholas made him swear to keep the secret as long as he lived. That gave rise to the legend of the mysterious dispenser of gifts who sneaks into houses at night to make children happy. In compliance with his principles, <strong>we won’t be offering you any tangible benefits</strong> in exchange for your support for MUNBAM. However, we can assure you that it will make you a full-blown St. Nicholas’s assistant, as proven by a certificate that will be sent to you by the Myrabilia association. And together with this, of course, you will be receiving many thanks on our part, from visitors young and old to MUNBAM and last but not least, from San Nicola or, if you prefer, from Santa Claus.</i></p>

<p><u><strong>Your donations will directly support the residents and the running of pIAR 2019</strong></u></p>
<p>Due to our logistical  inability to fully fund our diverse and talented selection of participants, we are appealing to our audience, fans, organisation, art enthusiasts and the general public for gap funding. With this gap funding, pIAR 2019 will be able to move forward and enhance Kumasi and surrounding regions with an influx of creative energies, projects, and dialog from fellow artists from all over the world. Without this support, the residency program will require participating artists  to host themselves, unduly weighting the pool of participants to non-African participants from wealthier nations. We would be glad to accept any contributions so that the program can run effectively and encourage this critical cultural project of artistic development and cultural exchange.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What we have already achieved:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We rented a six bedroom house with a large open space.</li>
<li>We painted all rooms</li>
<li>We recruited volunteers to assist and work with the selected artists</li>
<li>We renovated the common spaces - bathroom, bedrooms, living room and kitchen</li>
<li>Now we're working on the movable wardrobes for each room.</li>
<li>In few days Vodafone will complete the installation of new wifi</li>
</ul>

<p><strong> What We Need for pIAR 2019: </strong></p>

<div>
<p><u>Breakdown detail for over 20 artists from January to August:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Travel Cost for artists from African countries</strong> who could not afford their travel expenses (Zimbabwe _1, Nigeria_4, Cameroon_2 and Togo_1). <u><i>Artists coming from outside Africa are advised to seek for funding from alternative organisations for their return flights</i></u>
</li>
<li>
<strong>6 new beds to be purchased for the newly rented apartments</strong>: We have already spent a great deal of funds to rent a large  new space for the residency. We are working on painting, furnishing and equipping the rooms for convenient stay but yet to purchase comfortable mattresses for each room.</li>
<li>
<strong>Feeding of artist and interns daily:</strong> Though cost of living in Ghana is not so high it will best to reduce any financial burden on the participating artist and interns by providing them with daily meal should we hit our goal.</li>
<li>
<strong>Material costs:</strong> We will be able to cover reasonable production and research cost for artists in residency should we hit our full campaign target.</li>
<li>
<strong>Utilities (Wifi, Gas, Water, Electricity):</strong> It will be important for constant internet availability and access to facilitate research and internet activities for the artists. We are on prepaid electricity system that required regular loading of credit for usage.</li>
<li>
<strong>Organising Artist Talk, Public Presentations and Workshops:</strong> We understand the financial commitments in organising these activities that demand the provision of refreshment (water, drinks, snacks) and printing of materials.</li>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p><strong>S</strong>ince its beginning in 2010, the Graffiti of War Project has been working tirelessly documenting rarely seen art created by veterans, local nationals, and even civilians specifically originating in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait.  Through our outreach efforts, thousands of images have poured in from all corners of the world submitted via our website and social-media pages. As the interest exploded, project founder, Jaeson Doc Parsons, a former combat medic, traveled to Iraq and Kuwait to document as much as possible before they were destroyed following the withdrawal of Coalition Forces.</p>
<p><strong>T</strong>his tour will feature the artwork we captured through our expedition overseas which we are presenting on unconventional mediums (Graffiti Canvas) and in astonishing sizes. Many of these murals were created in excess of 40 feet by 20 feet. A truly extraordinary event providing a unique perspective on conflicts which have affected the entire world since September 11th, 2001.</p>
<p><strong>T</strong>he ultimate aim for this project is to raise awareness for those men and women, soldier and civilian that suffer the silent wounds of war, PTSD &amp; TBI. Our goal is to promote and advance alternative therapies for these unseen wounds such as arts therapy. We believe this book and the tour will be a bridge over the ever-widening gap between military members and civilians providing healing for both the artist and the spectator. Proceeds from every book and piece of art sold will go directly to partnering organizations to help them fund alternative therapies for PTSD.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>A</strong>s this war continues, our nation has become silently divided, the widening divide between soldier and civilian grows with each year. It has become more and more difficult to understand the life and trials of a deployed soldier and their family. Although most Americans support our brave men and women, they don’t grasp the magnitude of what effect this conflict and subsequent deployments have on the families as well as the mind and soul of the soldier. </p>
<p><strong>I</strong>n documenting and showcasing these images created by soldiers, marines, and airmen as well as local nationals in Iraq and Afghanistan, our aim is to give a unique glimpse into the minds of those who endured these conflicts. To provide America an inside look at what has gone almost entirely unseen to the vast majority of the public. Many of these images are raw and created in the moment on unconventional canvases in a very unconventional war. Exhibiting this artwork will help civilians get a better understanding of how it is to be separated from family, to lose one of your own in a blink of an eye, to get a feel, a taste of what 15 months fighting a very unpopular war is like. To bring understanding to Americans not familiar with the emotions of war.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>T</strong>he bold ambitions and objectives of this Project, like anything worthwhile, will not be accomplished without a price, and the burden of our short-term and long-term goals are too much for our team to shoulder alone if we are to ensure the resounding success of what we have set out to achieve.  </p>
<p><strong>T</strong>hese needs are not ours, but the needs of those brave warriors, this Nation’s citizen soldiers, who were affected by the conflicts of our world.  They willingly answered with service and sacrifice to a Nation that called, and now we united citizens of that Nation must answer the call to help these wounded warfighters in return.  This project is committed to that mission, and we are searching for individuals and organizations throughout the U.S. and the world that are ready to stand with us in that commitment . . . Semper Fidelis.</p>

In the spirit of old skool album cover art, each print is 12"" x 12"" in size. With key words selected by LondonBaby added to each image.  The end  result is a series of mini billboard-like pieces of art that can be held in the hand, framed or placed anywhere in home or office.</p>

I want to play with gaze, the concept of who this “vanity” is actually working for, as well as representation of women and how it continues in mainstream culture today.</p><p>These paintings relate to another project I want to begin, based around Instagram/blog photographers, and this new wave “Renaissance” idea of representation of women as art.

The location of the residency would allow me to visit multiple museums and galleries, taking in an immense amount of art history in nearby Barcelona, as well as Madrid.I’m currently interested in the idea of vanity and publicized glamour, specifically discussed in John Berger’s book and TV series, “Ways of Seeing.” Between the studio time and surrounding museums, Can Serrat would be an excellent place to begin this series of paintings. I’m interested in using my own body and personal perspective, as well as painting your average blow up “Judy” doll in place of Venetian goddesses or women of wealth in these satirical paintings. I want to play with gaze, the concept of who this “vanity” is actually working for, as well as representation of women and how it continues in mainstream culture today.These paintings relate to another project I want to begin, based around Instagram/blog photographers, and this new wave “Renaissance” idea of representation of women as art. This project and research plays with the debate of the male gaze, representation of women, the nude, and what makes something ""art.” At Can Serrat I plan to continue researching and developing the parameters for this project, and to experiment with whether painting or another medium will function best.The funding I’m asking for covers the cost of the residency (1140 Euros), airport shuttle (100E), and estimated cost for the flight ($1000), plus the Indiegogo percentage (5% if funds fully raised-8%partial). Anything extra that comes from this campaign will go to extra travel costs (bus and train tickets to Barcelona and Madrid), materials (paints, paper, canvas, etc.), and food. Everything donated to this campaign will go to getting me to Spain. In the event I don’t raise a substantial amount and can not attend, the money raised will go back into my art for studio and supply costs.In return, I’m offering a range of perks! From social media shout outs, thank you notes with personal photographs from my trip, art cards, prints, studio sketches, and more! Check them out!By contributing to this campaign, you will help me get to El Bruc, Spain! This will allow me to focus on my practice, continue to experiment in the studio, and question my processes. Working in a community of other artists will help me to think critically about my decisions, step back and reevaluate.This is the first time that I will be traveling to Europe, and what better way to do it than spend 4 weeks making art in a creative community! I've had to turn down study abroad opportunities in the past, and don't wish to do the same for this residency. Can Serrat is a beautiful non profit program that promotes “art production focused on contemporary practices and research.” All the funds go directly back into the residency for grants, maintaining the grounds, studios, etc. so it's money well spent!The risk and challenges with this project are financial. Neither the residency, nor the cost of travel, supplies, or living are paid for. With short notice of being accepted, I am having difficulty coming up with the necessary funds to cover the deposit, flight, residency amount, and estimated costs while abroad. On top of bills such as student loans and car payments, paired with costs of graduate applications and visits, this is not an easy amount to cover.This is an amazing opportunity to travel, and work in a beautiful location in Spain. If I can't raise the necessary funds to attend, I will lose out on my deposit and travel. I’ve never used a crowd funding source before, but I hope that this first experience is a great and successful one! Please help me achieve this goal!Thank you!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>In Short, What We're Doing:</h3>
<p>We've got a crazy idea to build something beautiful for a couple weeks this summer with a curated group of other young people... sort of like an artist's residency, social experiment, exercise in community and intellectual exchange, and more.</p>
<p><i>We've finalized the group and location, and just need to close out some funding.</i></p>
<p><strong>In order to make this happen, we need your support. We're raising $5,000 to help fund the program (which will cover materials, transportation, and hefty scholarships to the program).</strong></p>

We will all live together in a house in upstate NY, and <strong>each resident will have an established creative project to start and finish during their stay</strong>. “Weekdays” (Mon-Thu) will be structured around independent work time, shared meals, and bi-weekly  workshops led by each individual, respectively. “Weekends” (Fri-Sun) surround creative collaboration (each participant has a designated weekend slot wherein other members are made accessible resources for their project); “hive mind” sessions, a space for sharing progress and feedback on everyone’s work; ceremonious meal time; sleep ins; adventuring and release; movie watching, dance parties, leisure time. Circulate creates a space conducive to self-care, processing and reflection, individual and co-evolution, healthy and constructive criticism of each other’s work and of society, life-affirming creation and connection, and whatever other values we define as a collective come our union.<strong> By the end of the experience</strong>, everyone will have completed and shared their projects with the collective.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Intentional Limitations</span></h3>
<p>We believe there is liberty in limitation. Here are a few things we're setting as guiding principles from the start:</p>
<p><strong>Presence:</strong></p>
<p>We are interested in fresh and raw and right now. This is an opportunity for a dedication to the environment and experience at present that most of us are profoundly NOT used to in our normal lives. We are freezing time together and creating a micro-world, indulging in a fleeting illusion that only we and now exist. Of course, now is a product of the past, and our respective current make-ups have been hyper informed by the recent past (seeping into present, also still going on) i.e. COVID-19. In short -- we are encouraging ourselves to show up AS WE ARE, and to pour whatever that is and means into this time, this community, this masterpiece.</p>
<p>We are fully committed to this time and space, which means no one can be working on anything else while they're here. No side projects, no internships. No phone calls, no virtual communication with the outside world. </p>
<p><strong>Technology:</strong></p>
<p>No phones or personal computers for the entire time. No WiFi, texting, or online researching. There will be a shared computer and a typewriter for use (writing, editing, etc.). </p>
<p><strong>We have finite materials:</strong></p>
<p>Anti-excess, anti google rabbit holes; we have a specific amount of resources. We don’t need an infinite web when we are infinite humans. We will each bring books, music, supplies, and create shared libraries of multimedia. There's a general culture of sharing.</p>
<p>This is what we know for now. Everything else is coevolving with the group.</p>
<h3>Who's Behind This?</h3>
<p>We are Lola Lafia (20) and Amira Stone (22). We’re friends, co-creators, co-dreamers. </p>
<p>A lot of our friendship and partnership has existed across space and time. Covid was an ultimate example of this, as we were both jumping between different worlds, observing, feeling and creating amidst the insane happenings of 2020. We managed to reflect and dream together via spontaneous phone calls, email, and other web-spaces, until we saw that there was something urgent and fervent here demanding our attention. We were like... we’re asking such similar questions and longing for such similar things, but we are worlds apart. Why? Let’s do something about this. We took what we’ve experienced this year, and years before, carved out a tiny piece from the middle of this encompassing venn diagram, and started building something together. We discovered that a breathing, multi-dimensional project would be the best medium: an environment that we are fostering together, with others. An experimental ground, a real time living white board. From this, Circulate emerged. </p>
<p>Circulate is just one iteration of the kinds of spaces, projects and communities we hope to foster and engage with for the rest of our lives. In birthing it into existence, we hope we inspire others to do the same. We dream of Circulate-esque experiences everywhere, always.</p>

In December, I moved to San Francisco and have been living in intentional communities around the city (giant houses with 12 adults where everyone has their own room but shares everything else - not just food and bathrooms, but conversations, salons, workshops, projects, using our shared space as a prototype for how we want to organize and socialize and make decisions). I also run Schefs (a platform for young people like us to lead and join in on intimate, themed conversations on topics of their choice - from climate change to consciousness), intersperse performance art into my daily life, and put on dining experiences with my 15 year old brother.</p>
<p><i>Amira Stone - </i>Hello hello hello! I’m from Minnesota, but I mostly grew up at summer camp in Northwoods Wisconsin.

It all circles back to this little sphere of grass and lake where phones don’t exist, rules are made to be broken, and college-aged students are your authority figures. This environment instilled in me a relentless and perpetual desire to learn, grow and engage in community, and to create spaces of my own. And ah, here we are. I observe, process and generate through filmmaking, traveling, writing, romance, movement, cooking, and of course, there’s more, more and more. I’m currently living in NYC, working at a k-12 school where my job is mostly to make sure kids don’t tackle each other, and to remind them to say ‘thank you’.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Welcome to The Denver Vendor!</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p>My name is Brenna Bigelow, and I am a Denver native with two passions: art and investing in my community! After seeing an art vending machine in New Mexico, I was determined to bring the concept to my hometown, but with an emphasis on <strong>local charity</strong>! Thus, <strong>The Denver Vendor</strong> was born!</p>
<p>The project began in August of 2019 with the purchase of a vintage candy machine (yes, it still works!). The machine has been sitting in my uncle's backyard in the process of becoming a <strong>charitable art installation</strong> ever since. We now have over 30 Denver artists that are participating in this project.</p>
<p>Progress has been made, however, because the project has primarily been independently funded by myself, the process has been slower than ideal. This is where you come in! The Denver Vendor team would love to have your financial assistance to speed up the process, and alleviate some of the heavy costs off my shoulders.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Cost Breakdown</strong></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>So far, the total cost has been $975.65, and more costs are to come. The current costs include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The machine $100</li>
<li>Moving costs $120</li>
<li>Paying an artist (fairly!) to paint the machine ($200+ continual cost)</li>
<li>A card reader ($446.32)</li>
<li>Website ($48)</li>
</ul>
<p>Expected costs are things such as monthly maintenance, moving costs, setting up the card reader, and more. As you can see, The Denver Vendor needs help from the community (you) so we can give back!</p>
<p>The truth is, no matter how long it's gonna take, I'm determined to launch The Denver Vendor project, so any investment you make will not be lost. I have big dreams for this art installation, and plan to plant as many machines around the Denver-metro area as possible. Ideally, donations will surpass the goal so The Denver Vendor can continue to grow.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Perks</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>So what do you get out of it for donating? The most rewarding perk of course is enriching our community, but if you need more incentives, there are a few.</p>
<p>Regardless of the amount, if you donate, you will get first dibs at using the machine at our release party AND you get to deduct that charitable donation on your taxes. Woohoo!</p>
<p>If you donate $30-$49, you will get two free tickets to see The 8-Bit Kids comedy show, any show date of your choice.</p>
<p>$50-$99 you will get the previous prizes AND a free gift-bag full of handmade art.</p>
<p>Any donations over $100 will get all that good stuff previously mentioned, AND your name (or name of your choice) on the machine itself! You will also be listed as one of our sponsors on our website.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">More Ways to Help</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Even if you cannot help us financially, we would love your help spreading the word! Be sure to use the Indiegogo share tools.</p>
<p>We are still accepting offers from indoor locations that want to host the machine. Ideally, the machine will go somewhere with lots of foot traffic.</p>
<p>If you'd like to learn more about The Denver Vendor, or just want to reach out and say hello, or even to become a Denver Vendor artist, visit us on our website thedenvervendor.com or on our social medias @thedenvervendor.</p>

<h3>The ShopArt ArtShop Story</h3>
<p><strong>As art enthusiasts, we are intrigued by the immense power of art to cross boundaries, build bridges, offer creative solutions and encourage thought. So when we started ShopArt ArtShop (SAAS) in 2013 with the idea to host a residency+festival in our village, we had no doubt that the project would have an enormous effect on a multitude of levels. Yet we were totally surprised by the huge resonance it created.</strong> </p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/MF9fkZXvyZ8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>The concern of SAAS is that in today's world, art has become a commodity; and so, for art to be relevant again beyond the economic aspect, it needs to be taken out of traditional 'art-spaces' such as art galleries, museums etc. and presented in a totally new and accessible manner.</p>
<p><strong>Which is why we take over all the empty shop-spaces in the Himalayan village, Gunehar, and turn these into open ateliers. We invite artists to present us with ideas about a conceptual art project they would like to create in these 'ArtShops' (hence the name of the project, ShopArt ArtShop-- or SAAS in short). The work need to be relevant (and find acceptance) among local people as well as a broader, art-interested public. We fund the selected artists and their projects by inviting them to the village for a month-long residency that culminates in a week-long, village-wide, FREE art festival.</strong></p>
<p>During the first two editions, we ourselves were surprised by the immense success (15000 visitors!). SAAS-1&amp;2 proved that a well thought-out, process-oriented, fully transparent and open art event has the power to transcend pre-existing notions about rural-urban, traditional-modern, first world-third world preconceptions.</p>
<p>This makes it necessary to continue the effort. So <strong>here we are now, shortly before the third edition of the trienniale!</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555259416/j75zdhirkx45l5mque5u.png"" src=""""/></p>
<div><h3>Why this project is unique</h3></div>
<p>Art is universal, but it can only be relevant if it is accessible to the larger public indiscriminately and in a manner that transcends boundaries. The unique <a href=""http://the4tablesproject.com/current-project"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">'SAAS-Method for Artists'</a> that we have designed and all our artists must follow is created to overcome barriers between art and public, artist and visitor, poor and rich, city folks and villager. </p>
<p><strong>SAAS is a triennial, month long event that takes place across the entire village, turning the whole</strong> <a href=""https://thewire.in/the-arts/how-artists-are-transforming-a-remote-kangra-village"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">village into an art destination</a><strong>. </strong>The first 3 weeks is conducted as an open residency, during which the artists work on their individual projects and visitors/villagers get a chance to follow the work process and, if willing, become assistants or even partners of the artists.</p>
<p><strong>The last week is reserved for the Art-Festival</strong>, which is village-wide and is accompanied by music concerts, film screenings, discussions, performances etc. </p>
<p><strong>The whole event is entirely free for public!</strong></p>

<h3>What happens next</h3>
<p>Our organisation team will assemble in Gunehar in the first week of May to set the stage. After that, all the artists will arrive on the 14th and will be given quarters across the village. On the 15th, the residency will start. </p>
<h3>Our financial situation</h3>
<p>For us, keeping SAAS alive is a responsibility, because SAAS fulfils many necessary functions and giving up now is not an option. It feels like in that case, years of hard work will be wasted!</p>
<p>Despite many difficulties, particularly in regards to funds, we have gone ahead with the planning for this edition. Over the years, we have tried and mostly failed to attract sponsors, government and institutional support, grants and such. This is surely because in India, there is still no appreciation or understanding of the arts and no culture yet of supporting arts and artists. We feel that by keeping up what we do, we can, in the long run, also change this perception.</p>
<p>So far, for our four art events, i.e SAAS - 1 and 2 and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-J0C3Yaoxc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">IN THE WOODS</a> - 1 and 2, we have spent a total of about 4000000,- Indian Rupees, which is just 55000,- US$.</p>
<p>Out of this, around 20% came from crowdfunding, and only 5% from the State Government. The rest of the budget was raised through Frank's private savings (which are now gone!) and the meagre income of our<strong> </strong><a href=""http://the4tablesproject.com/bir-billing-cafe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cafe</a> and <a href=""http://the4roomshotel.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mud house guest house</a>.</p>
<h3>What we need </h3>
</div><div>
<p>These are the three scenarios:</p>
<p><strong>1) If we can not raise the minimum goal:</strong> In this case, we will still go ahead with the residency on a budget-on-strings and will have to compromise heavily on materials, logistics and publicity... and most unfortunately, strike the final festival. Luckily, this campaign is flexible, so whatever you donate will help!</p>
<p><strong>2) If, with your help, we can raise the minimum amount: </strong>This will take care of all our requirements. Our total budget requirement for SAAS-3 is 1460000 Indian rupees, or 20857 US$. Indiegogo fees and reserve funds roughly make up an additional 10%! <strong>So we need to raise a total of 22857 US$.</strong> <strong>That is only 1904 US$ per artist/individual art project!</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555325450/zqkapgtmxwowoju8my3x.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>3) If, we end up raising more than the minimum amount: </strong>In this case, the extra money raised would go towards our next project, IN THE WOODS-3, in 2020. This is why we will keep this campaign alive on Indiegogo InDemand.</p>

</div></div>","The ShopArt ArtShop Story
As art enthusiasts, we are intrigued by the immense power of art to cross boundaries, build bridges, offer creative solutions and encourage thought. So when we started ShopArt ArtShop (SAAS) in 2013 with the idea to host a residency+festival in our village, we had no doubt that the project would have an enormous effect on a multitude of levels. Yet we were totally surprised by the huge resonance it created. 

 
The concern of SAAS is that in today's world, art has become a commodity; and so, for art to be relevant again beyond the economic aspect, it needs to be taken out of traditional 'art-spaces' such as art galleries, museums etc. and presented in a totally new and accessible manner.
Which is why we take over all the empty shop-spaces in the Himalayan village, Gunehar, and turn these into open ateliers. We invite artists to present us with ideas about a conceptual art project they would like to create in these 'ArtShops' (hence the name of the project, ShopArt ArtShop-- or SAAS in short). The work need to be relevant (and find acceptance) among local people as well as a broader, art-interested public. We fund the selected artists and their projects by inviting them to the village for a month-long residency that culminates in a week-long, village-wide, FREE art festival.
During the first two editions, we ourselves were surprised by the immense success (15000 visitors!). SAAS-1&2 proved that a well thought-out, process-oriented, fully transparent and open art event has the power to transcend pre-existing notions about rural-urban, traditional-modern, first world-third world preconceptions.
This makes it necessary to continue the effort. So here we are now, shortly before the third edition of the trienniale!

Why this project is unique
Art is universal, but it can only be relevant if it is accessible to the larger public indiscriminately and in a manner that transcends boundaries. The unique 'SAAS-Method for Artists' that we have designed and all our artists must follow is created to overcome barriers between art and public, artist and visitor, poor and rich, city folks and villager. 
SAAS is a triennial, month long event that takes place across the entire village, turning the whole village into an art destination. The first 3 weeks is conducted as an open residency, during which the artists work on their individual projects and visitors/villagers get a chance to follow the work process and, if willing, become assistants or even partners of the artists.
The last week is reserved for the Art-Festival, which is village-wide and is accompanied by music concerts, film screenings, discussions, performances etc. 
The whole event is entirely free for public!
During the last two editions of SAAS, more than 15000 people from all walks of life visited the village! Both editions were also highly praised in national media. 
For an impression of what the news media said, here is a link to one of the articles.


 
The curatorial theme of the current edition

The theme this time around is BORDERLINES. You can read the whole elaboration by following this link, and scrolling down. But let's quote a paragraph from the brief, because it is not only relevant to current, world-wide developments, but a natural thematic point we at SAAS have arrived at:

After a thorough selection process during which artists from all over India were requested to present a concept that would address the curatorial theme ""BORDERLINES"", we have finally selected 12 artists. These are: Sultana Zana (Multi Media/Film), Imon Raza (Installation), Pramila Chaudhary (Fashion and Textiles), Sarban Choudhury (Ceramics/Sculptures), Asmita Sarkar (Painting), Amritah Sen (Visual Narratives), KM Lo (Film), Frank Schlichtmann (Installation), Found On All Fours (Story-telling/Performance), Devyani Smith (Ceramics/Installation), Gaurav Gokhale (Documentary) and Yash Sahai (Music).

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Does Vladimir Putin have video footage of Donald Trump paying Russian escorts to pee on him or on each other, and is Putin using it as leverage to control Trump? Probably.</p>
<p>We don't know for sure, but it would explain a lot of otherwise inexplicable things.</p>
<p>Even if this footage is never found, would it be amusing to see dogs around the world pee on tiny likenesses of Donald Trump? Definitely.</p>
<p>Additionally, there's a very practical use for the Pee-on-me Trump. If you want to encourage dogs to pee somewhere besides your prized flower bed, just place one of these little guys nearby,  spritz them with a doggy potty-training aid or just a few drops of Windex or other ammonia-based cleaner, and you'll be giving neighborhood hounds a perfectly appropriate place to pee. The Pee-on-me Trump is ideal for people who are anti-Trump, pro-dog, and pro-flower.</p>
<p>We have already achieved success with dogs peeing on Trump in New York City, and the handful of statues here have made headlines around the world. We're already making as many as we can to send to other states and other countries, but it has become very clear that we must scale up production to make the dream of peeing on Trump as real as possible for as many as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How Funds Will Be Used</h3>
<p>Once production is up and running, it will be self-sustaining – but I need the initial capital to get started.</p>
<p><strong>Funds will be used to:</strong></p>
<p>– redesign for efficient mass production</p>
<p>– prototype development</p>
<p>– produce the first run of Trumpee Stumps</p>
<p>– dedicate time to managing production, final assembly and finishing, shipping and PR</p>
<p>– add production staff</p>
<p>– strategically place existing prototypes in key cities around the world </p>
<p>– bring Pee-on-me Trumps to various art festivals in the US</p>
<p>We have some great perks that also commemorate this shitstorm of a Presidency in other creative ways, including 2019 Trumpspiration calendars, a few one-off Trump-mocking pieces, and some beautiful historical moments and quotes printed on metal.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Can Achieve</h3>
<p>The publicity around the first batch of statues has been really fun. But it has also helped boost interest in other articles about the very real possibility of the pee tapes. So if we can make mass production a reality, we'll be encouraging comedy, performance art, and canine etiquette while also reminding people about a very real issue with international implications.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The main challenge is just the up-front production costs and making time to manage the operation. But there seems to be enough momentum to make it happen.</p>

What We Can Achieve
The publicity around the first batch of statues has been really fun. But it has also helped boost interest in other articles about the very real possibility of the pee tapes. So if we can make mass production a reality, we'll be encouraging comedy, performance art, and canine etiquette while also reminding people about a very real issue with international implications.
 

Challenges
The main challenge is just the up-front production costs and making time to manage the operation. But there seems to be enough momentum to make it happen.

<p>Hello everyone, my name is Levi Bettwieser.  I’m the founder and film technician for The Rescued Film Project, rescuedfilm.com.  For those who
don’t know, The Rescued Film Project is an archive of images that we rescued
from lost and forgotten rolls of film, from all over the world.  To date, we’ve rescued over 18,000
images.  We could not have done this
without the support of all of you.</p>
<p>We started this campaign, because we need your help
again.  Around 1 year ago, we acquired 66
bundles of film.  Each bundle contains
anywhere from 8-36 rolls of film, totaling what we’re estimating to be about
1,200 rolls, all shot by the same photographer in the 1950s.  Now that fact in itself is intriguing, but
even more interesting is the way in which this film was packaged.  Each roll once shot, was placed back in it’s
box with a hand written note detailing what was shot.  Then the box was wrapped in several layers of
aluminum foil, then athletic tape.  Then
the photographer wrote on the athletic tape what was on the film.  Once the photographer had enough rolls
like this, they were packed tightly in a cigar box then the cigar box was wrapped in multiple
layers of newspaper, aluminum foil, and athletic tape and then once again
labeled with the contents.  Recently I
had an amazing group of volunteers come help unpack and catalog the rolls and
in 6 hours, 8 of us were only able to get through 22 of the 66 bundles because
of this packaging.</p>
<p>I’m asking for your help because this is way more film than
I can process myself.  I’ve actually
processed one roll and you’ll see that while the film has images, it is
degraded.  This film was shot in the
1950s, and every day it goes unprocessed, it deteriorates a little more.  So we’re partnering with Blue Moon Camera in
Portland to process the majority of this film for us.  Unlike our project which is just done in our
spare time outside of our full time jobs, Blue Moon Camera can add this film to
their daily processing queue and rescue this film much faster than we
could.  They’ve also been generous enough
to grant us a large discount.  But, it
still is going to cost money for time, chemicals and disposal, envelopes,
archive sleeves, shipping, and travel. 
So please help fund this project so we can rescue these images and
ensure that the photographers memories and dedication to preserving them aren’t
lost.  If everyone who follows us on
social media and enjoys seeing the images we rescue gives just $1, we will have
more than enough to save this film.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for the support, please share this video
with others.  We will be documenting this
process along the way so everyone will know exactly what’s going on.</p>

meet the real needs and aspirations to some of the most vulnerable and
disadvantaged people in our society. Our approach is to develop enterprise so

start with soft skills such as communication, team work, confidence,
discipline, sense of purpose, improved self-worth. Our work aims to tackle
these issues by providing a safe and welcoming environment to develop the
necessary skills to increase voluntary and employment opportunities as well as
contributing to their local community.

The Team:
The Can
Do Man


The can-do
man is the man with plan, the origin of the outrageous ambition began with him.
He works closely with the head of happiness and the thistle blower to make his
ambition shared and possible.
Head Of
Happiness
Our head of
happiness has the amazing job of improving the health and well-being of the
people who come to the hub. Wants to make a positive change to people’s lives
through the hub, whilst making all those who come here happy.
Ninja Mouse
The ninja
mouse is our digital arts developer, she is extremely adept at manipulating the
mouse to create some amazing pieces of art. She helped us design a few areas of
the website as well as a few other bits and pieces. Examples of her brilliant
work are on our Outrageous Crew page, all the characters on that page were
designed by the Mouse Ninja herself, based on the real life individuals.
Head of
Smile Distribution
Our Head of
Smile Distributions is also one of the inspirations for Outrageous Ambition.
You may have read about her on our Outrageous Journey? The head of smile
distributions uses her bubbly personality and sense of humour to makes
everyone’s day in the space that little bit brighter. If it weren’t for Chloe
we may all not have come together at the Outrageous Hub.
The
Conductor Of Creations
The
Conductor of creations is our on site budding artist with a creative mind. He
has made a number of creations which will ultimately be introduced to our store
once we are up and running. He has created some brilliant pieces using a wide
range of media, from making 80’s retro creations from perler beads to some
origami masterpieces. In fact you may recognise a couple pieces of his work as
the origami swan and origami tree on our Outrageous hub page.


The ImpactThe
social impact of our work is measured in the health and well-being of those
involved. Many disabled and disadvantaged people lack a sense of purpose,
have limited opportunities and face problems such as; a lack of confidence; low aspirations; social
isolation; depression and other mental health problems; limited skills and job
opportunities.

We will not pay ourselves and promise to use the most cost-effective services, while maintaining highest possible quality, to maximize donations. All expense and donation information will be disclosed to our donors. When we reach our goal we will open up an online store, take on team members (check rewards section!), and continue to grow our community and sticker collection throughout 2016. Again, these will be voluntary efforts and we will use every penny to support Bernie's campaign.A big THANK YOU in advance to all future donors, Instagram followers, and current Bernie Sanders supporters out there! Follow us on Instagram @StickWithSanders !Contact Us at StickWithSanders2016@gmail.com !If you support Bernie but decide not to donate today, help us spread the word about our Indiegogo page! Let's put Bernie Sanders in the White House!Sticker Dimensions:Not sold on our stickers but still want Sanders swag?

<h3>WHO AM I?</h3>
<p>Hello fellow Rider fans!  My name is Jeremy Bresciani.  I am a professional sports artist with a love for Rider football.  I grew up in Regina, in a large, hardcore Rider family and despite moving to Edmonton 30 years ago, and the Vancouver area 6 years ago, I am still, and ALWAYS WILL BE, a Rider Fan!  </p>
<p>I have been drawing Rider pieces since 2010 with a focus on creating pieces that bring the fans to the forefront.  All of my artwork is based on REAL fans.  I have spent as much as 900 hours working on a single piece of art and have drawn as many as 504 real fans in full, recognizable detail, into a single piece of art. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?</h3>
<p>I want to create the ultimate Rider Pride piece of art and give YOU and your fellow Rider fans the chance to be a part of it!  This will be my most customizable piece to date, giving Rider fans many different ways to be a part of the artwork and personalizing it just for them!  Ideally, I would like all of you to own a unique piece (a one-off just for you!) that is unlike any artwork your fellow Rider fan's may own.  I will explain that in more detail below.  </p>
<p>The first Rider piece of art I ever drew was titled ""Three Generations of Pride"".  Although, I am very happy with that piece, I want to take the concept of ""Game Day"" to a new level.  We have another Grey Cup, a new stadium and a lot of history I didn't touch on in my previous work.  My goal is to incorporate every historical moment, pay tribute to every Legend and celebrate every detail of what it means to be a part of Rider Nation and have RIDER PRIDE!  Help me make this possible Rider Nation!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>PERSONALIZATION (YOU'RE GOING TO DRAW ONE JUST FOR ME?)</h3>
<p>Yes.  Here are SEVERAL ways I can make this artwork just for you!</p>
<p><u><strong>(1) YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES WALKING TO THE GAME!</strong></u>  The first one is pretty simple.  EVERYONE that supports this project will have the opportunity submit photos of themselves walking away from the camera while wearing their Rider gear.  I will draw them into the artwork as if they were walking to the game.  No exclusions.  EVERYONE that supports this project WILL be in the artwork!</p>
<p><u><strong>(2) YOUR NAMES ON JERSEYS!</strong></u>  EVERYONE that supports this project can ask for names to be added to the jerseys on up to 5 fans in the artwork they ordered.  Once the prints are made, I will personally add your family names onto the backs of the fans in your print(s).  </p>
<p><u><strong>(3) YOUR FACE ON THE BIG SCREEN!</strong></u>  If you support this project by purchasing an XL 24""x30"" print, you can submit any photo you'd like and I will draw you onto the Jumbo Video Screen in the stadium!   Yes, your artwork would be the only one that has YOU on the big screen!  OR it could be a Game highlight of your choosing! </p>
<p><u><strong>(4) Personalize it to YOUR OWN HISTORY!</strong></u>  If you support this project by purchasing an XL 24""x30"" print, you can ask me to draw any Rider player, game stats, game score and opponent on the appropriate areas of the jumbo tron video screen!  You can make this GAME DAY any game you wish!  It could be any of the Grey Cup games in our history, or maybe a Labour Day classic, or maybe a special game you shared with a loved one! </p>
<h3>AUTOGRAPHED BY RIDER LEGENDS!</h3>
<p>I am honoured to say that Ray Elgaard, Jeff Fairholm, Don Narcisse, Roger Aldag, Tim McCray, Dale West, Al Ford and Dave ""Robokicker"" Ridgway will be signing 100 of the XL 24""x30"" Personalized Limited Edition Prints!  Anyone supporting this project by purchasing one of these prints will receive ALL 8 LEGEND AUTOGRAPHS on their print!  GO RIDERS!!!!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>HOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE TO DRAW?</h3>
<p>This piece will take me 3-6 months to draw and you will be updated on its progress every step of the way.  I will do many Facebook Live feeds while I draw it and I will post photo updates on my Facebook page as well.  You can opt in to receive these updates by e-mail, if you'd prefer.</p>
<h3>HOW CAN YOU HELP ME?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>This is a very large project to undertake.  Having completed many even larger projects in the past for the Riders and many hockey teams, I know the time commitment that lay before me.  This is the reason I set up this Indiegogo page.  With a 2-year old son and a second baby on his or her way, I cannot afford the luxury of drawing for months on end without knowing if anyone is interested in purchasing the artwork or prints when I have completed it.  If this campaign reaches its funding goal, I will be able to put the time into drawing this complex piece with the piece of mind that I can still support my family while I do so.</p>
<p>Please note that I am licensed by the Saskatchewan Roughriders which means a portion of all sales goes directly to the team.  </p>
</div><p>If you are not able to support this project through funding, PLEASE help my sharing it via Indiegogo's sharing tools,  other social media or word of mouth.  Thank-you VERY MUCH Rider Nation!  GO RIDERS!!!!!</p><p> </p></div>","WHO AM I?

<h3>About the Exhibition</h3>
<p>This is a limited-run installation, running from April 9th-19th at the EnclaveLab in London. Emma Reinhardt is an American independent curator based in London. She has previously partnered with  Marc Straus gallery in New York City, Maccarone Los Angeles,  and the Hong Kong Contemporary Art Foundation as part of her curatorial practice. Currently, she is studying Masters of Fine Art in Curating at Goldsmiths, University of London. For this exhibition, she has teamed up with artists Louis Mason and Zoe Jackson to create a one-of-a-kind show which brings together the mediums of painting, drawing, sculpture, and written word. This exhibition features a series of performances during the opening night, where Mason and British artist Lorde Selys will read aloud the pieces they have written in response to the works. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Artist's Bios</h3>
<p>Louis Mason is a Polish-Australian artist and writer based in London. He has shown and published extensively in Australia and the UK, and is currently engaged in postgraduate study at Goldsmiths College. In 2012 he was a co-founder of Knight St Art Space, and was the director of that space over the course of its operation. Examples of his writing and previous artworks can be found at <a href=""http://www.louis-mason.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.louis-mason.com/</a>. </p>
<p>Zoe Jackson is a practicing artist from Melbourne, Australia. She finished her BAFA this year at RMIT University. She primarily uses drawing and various textile approaches to manipulate and come to terms with images of women she sources from Instagram and popular culture. Actualised in their installation and display, the works push and pull between attraction and repulsion, acceptance and refusal.</p>
<p>Lorde Selys is an artist working collaboratively with words, lenses, multi-definitions of space, their users and inhabitants. Her works, including texts, screenings, performances, and installations were presented internationally. Between 2006 and 2010 she collaborated with the Aether9 group – an online platform for transnational story-telling and real-time performance – as a scriptwriter, actor, and photographer. She currently researches human versus nonhuman logics of memory, their dramaturgic, and political form of cohabitation at the Visual Culture department at Goldsmith College, London.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Budget Breakdown</h3>
<p><strong>£400</strong></p>
<p>This is to pay me and each of my artists £100 each. We are all contributing tireless hours to this exhibition and even if I cannot pay myself, I owe it to my artists to cover the cost of their labour. They deserve so much more than this small amount. </p>
<p><strong>£140</strong></p>
<p>This is to cover shipping costs. Zoe Jackson is based out of Melbourne, Australia and in a perfect world, this campaign would be able to make enough money to cover her flights. However, at the very least the cost of sending her magnificent drawings to and from London needs to be covered if this exhibition is to be rendered whole.</p>
<p><strong>£100</strong></p>
<p>This is to cover material fees. That includes: exhibition books, flyers, construction materials, power cables, and more. The small, behind-the-scenes things that are necessary but not always pretty.</p>
<p><strong>£60</strong></p>
<p>This covers opening night costs which <u>most importantly</u> covers drinks and photography. </p>

Examples of his writing and previous artworks can be found at http://www.louis-mason.com/. 
Zoe Jackson is a practicing artist from Melbourne, Australia. She finished her BAFA this year at RMIT University. She primarily uses drawing and various textile approaches to manipulate and come to terms with images of women she sources from Instagram and popular culture. Actualised in their installation and display, the works push and pull between attraction and repulsion, acceptance and refusal.
Lorde Selys is an artist working collaboratively with words, lenses, multi-definitions of space, their users and inhabitants. Her works, including texts, screenings, performances, and installations were presented internationally. Between 2006 and 2010 she collaborated with the Aether9 group – an online platform for transnational story-telling and real-time performance – as a scriptwriter, actor, and photographer. She currently researches human versus nonhuman logics of memory, their dramaturgic, and political form of cohabitation at the Visual Culture department at Goldsmith College, London. 

Budget Breakdown
£400
This is to pay me and each of my artists £100 each. We are all contributing tireless hours to this exhibition and even if I cannot pay myself, I owe it to my artists to cover the cost of their labour. They deserve so much more than this small amount. 
£140
This is to cover shipping costs. Zoe Jackson is based out of Melbourne, Australia and in a perfect world, this campaign would be able to make enough money to cover her flights. However, at the very least the cost of sending her magnificent drawings to and from London needs to be covered if this exhibition is to be rendered whole.
£100
This is to cover material fees. That includes: exhibition books, flyers, construction materials, power cables, and more. The small, behind-the-scenes things that are necessary but not always pretty.
£60
This covers opening night costs which most importantly covers drinks and photography.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>         Art Tuscany Style   </strong></h2>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>Are you interested in owning one of the fabulous pieces of ancient art from Florence, the city of <strong>Leonardo</strong> and <strong>Michelangelo</strong>? And what about coming a modern Patron of the Arts as in 1500 was <strong>Lorenzo the Magnificent</strong>?</p>
<p>Then come and experience this wonderful adventure with us…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are Florentine entrepreneurs, specialized in art, furniture and <i>interior</i> design; we work together with artists and master craftsmen. The research, care and respect for the roots and etymology of these forms of ancient art are guaranteed by the direct involvement and supervision of Art History Professors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""><strong><i>If Italy is the birthplace of the Renaissance, then Florence is the city that above all has embodied the essence.</i></strong></p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>A story that the entire world looks at with admiration: almost half of the masterpieces of the 1500s around the world are kept here in Florence. <strong>Leonardo, Dante, Michelangelo, Cellini, Giotto, Botticelli, Masaccio, Brunelleschi</strong>... they were all here.</p>
<p>To become a successful painter or sculptor, it was necessary to enroll from a young age in a Studio: a large workshop building, in which the master apart from practicing his own craft could also consider it to be his own home.</p>
<p>Basically, all of the famous artists mentioned have attended the Studios: in the one of <strong>Andrea Del Verrocchio</strong> would then grow the universal genius of <strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong>, along with other young apprentices including <strong>Botticelli</strong> e il <strong>Perugino</strong>; in the one of <strong>Ghirlandaio</strong> the great Michelangelo Buonarroti will make his first experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Lorenzo de' Medici</strong>, also called <i>Lorenzo the Magnificent</i>, exponent of the family “de 'Medici” and head of the city’s lordship, was the first to understand the importance of art and its interpreters for Florence and the world. Thanks to patronage and his thirst for culture, he managed to surround himself with quite influential intellectuals and artists. In some ways it is to him that we pay tribute: there is no doubt that today Lorenzo would use crowdfunding, to make the Florentine artists known.</p>

<p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" hspace=""12"" src=""""/><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" hspace=""12"" src=""""/>All around us, only few hundred meters away, there are still Artists who use ancient forms of art: in painting, in furnaces, in jewelry. From there comes the idea of ​​""opening"" our own <strong><i>Studio</i></strong> like those of the Renaissance so that anyone, in every corner of the world, would have the luck we have: touching by hand every day, breathing the smell of that cradle of civilization and art that was Florence between 1500 and 1600.</p>
<p><strong>With a big difference compared to the past: that the Atelier of Art Tuscany Style will have an international breath and will look out on the World ...</strong></p>
<p>For this reason we’ve chosen the most evolved and democratic tool currently available: Crowdfunding. Thanks to this tool, anyone of you, with a minimum investment, can contribute to the rebirth of these forms of ancient art and, in exchange, will own a piece, in the form of an <strong>original wood painting of 1600, in terracotta and with sculptures created by an internationally recognized master or possess a jewel structured in the same forge as those worn by the Florentine Renaissance Madonnas, </strong>made in pure bronze with engraved Murano glass and antique porcelains intaglio, with our jewelry line by “T”.</p>
<p>In short, it is a unique opportunity to be part, together, of the most important recovery community of these lost arts becoming, at the same time, members of the most exclusive club in the world: <strong>Art Tuscany Style</strong>.

<p align=""center""><strong>THE REWARDS</strong></p>
<p>The backers will receive the reward depending on the kind of donation and type chosen: each piece will be handcrafted by hand by Florentine artists and will be a unique piece. This donation will allow every backer to create an art production, respecting the Florentine Renaissance tradition. For the <strong>Crafts</strong>, using not only ancient techniques but also wooden supports, original from the 1500s and 1600s.  <strong>Terracotta </strong>items, instead, are created by Masters of the Impruneta fornaces- where the myth of Florentine terracotta was born, still appreciated and known all over the world - and the clay comes from the same quarries to which Brunelleschi drew to realize the roofing tiles and the bricks of the dome of the Cathedral of Florence. Finally, the Jewels by “T” will be made studying the images about ancient ornaments worn during the Renaissance, using the same engraving techniques at the time.</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p align=""center""><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Art Tuscany Style</strong> it allows everyone, in every corner of the world, with a very limited expense, to own a piece of that history that we all admire in museums. At home, so that you can watch it, touch it and smell it every day, sharing it with your friends.</p>

<p><strong>THE TRIBALEGLOBALE'S INTIMATE MUSEUM: FROM CHESTS TO YOUR DRESSER...</strong></p>

<p><strong>The artworks are present in the Tribaleglobale collection : over 1000 pieces</strong> in terracotta, wood, metals, stones, organic materials such as human hair, bony skins, carved bones, toothpicks, collected in thirty years by Giuliano Arnaldi, organized in the format <strong>TRIBALEGLOBALE:</strong> the smallest artwork measure 2 cm, the largest several meters, the oldest is more than five thousand years old, the most recent just few months, the cheapest cost a few tens of euros, the most expensive today would be unavailable .. <strong>each has the great archetypal value </strong>of what it is about the human being, his questions, and the beauty of the path of life. </p>
<p><strong>The Tribaleglobale's Museum is closed in chests because it takes too much space and too much money to show them all together... but this problem can become an opportunity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why should artworks be exhibited only in traditional defined spaces? And why should they only be destined for a collective enjoyment?</strong> Starting from this second consideration, it can be said that it is exactly the opposite: the artwork often arises to be seen (and not looked at ...) exclusively by those who create it, which later undergoes an external look and bit by bit to a wider observation. If the work has the ""quid"", as it is said today, it still continues to talk to each human being who is reacting with it, and not to all people together: it is the archetype that manifests itself.</p>
<p><strong>So why don't we exhibit with few objects, and ""at home""?</strong></p>
<p>Exhibiting many works together creates a logistical problems and  the risk of some sort of drunkenness ... then I thought of giving structure and continuity to a gesture I have so far done for myself. For a while, I've been pulling out a few pieces of work from a chest  and put them on desk to see them constantly and always in a new perspective. It's a common gesture for every collector. I realized that I pay great attention to other aspects, such as the number of objects, which is always symbolic: 1, 3, 7, 9 ... In addition to an implicit harmony that you feel, it must be the poem of the numbers that is talking. I also discovered discrete monumentalism that certain objects emanate: they are only a few inches long but they could be meters... monuments in power that turn into action just by changing the look ... In fact, I organize exhibitions on my desk,  con/fusing myself in the game of proportions. </p>
<p><strong>So the idea of ​​the table exhibition was born. </strong> If you like our look at art you can rent them for short periods, you will soon find the different proposals online: it will work like delivery pizza, a kind of ""artistic catering"", with 'themed menus and an exquisite ""<strong>CARD MENU</strong>"" that you can consult on <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/tribaleglobale/collections/72157660604758371/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.flickr.com/photos/tribaleglobale/co...</a> Thus  you will help our project, that walks only with its legs...

<h2>About</h2>
<p>This piece originally started as a social political piece about American archetypes and their effect on our current social and political landscape. My previous work investigates how the the figure of the cowboy has deeply implanted itself into the subconscious of the working class. How the stoic figure who works himself to death and sleeps in the dirt and would never need health insurance is not an icon of the working class, but a convenient propaganda tool for a late capitalism. We have a culture that encourages people to vote against their own interests and icons that glorify their suffering. These narratives are not only tools of obedience but templates that are easily impersonated by the ruling class to bluff a false comradely with the American public.  At first I approached the public figure of Evel Knievel as an extension of this idea. There is a glorified masochism, nationalism and heroic epic embedded in the collective public memory of Evel that aligns with the long lineage of the cowboy. The children who tuned in to watch the great American hero risk his life in his red white and blue jumpsuit are now grown and voting. I still believe that his image has contributed to this prescribed narrative of the masses, however the preliminary research of the performance piece took on a life of its own and things are far more complicated than I could have predicted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Iv read most available biographies, watched countless documentaries, searched every interview and then finally began communication with those who were close to Evel. I realized that the hero comes equipped with all of the complexes as the rest of us trying to exist here as humans. His legacy started to take form of real people in my own life. I now wince when watching his crashes. I cry when the biographies eventually get to the part where he passes in 2007. You can't spend this much time with a person and not feel close to them. He was an extremely complicated man who’s life was not the gilded image he laboriously tried to promote. He broke nearly every bone in his body and spent most of his life in pain for the entertainment of the American people who eventually abandoned him when he started landing safely. He was a man who later suffered from what can be described as PTSD from the sound of engines. He said he would do a stunt and he did it, whether he really wanted to or not. Keeping his word was everything.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don't envision this as an embodiment of a hero or a villain, i'm more invested in the mire of multidimensional grey area and the failures that are inherently built into the piece. I'm interested in the closest version of a truthful embodiment. He was a man of many intricacies, a person who hurt some people but is still loved and protected by many who were a part of his life. For me, this is a performance of not only investigation, but reconciliation</p>

<h2><strong>Who we are</strong></h2>
<p>The team Sculpting Democracy hopes to bring levity and humor into an otherwise bleak political world.  We hope that our sculptures are viewed as an artist interpretation of fun facts, fake news, and insane politics.  We like to say we are starting a brand new wave of POP culture politics!</p>

Another goal is to use our platform to always contribute to society in a meaningful way.

<h3>The Impact We hope to have with our Campaign is simple:</h3>
<ul><li>We are in a new world of politics where things are happening that you wouldn't believe if they were written for in a sitcom or Horror film! So why not add a new era of pop culture in politics by creating some irreverence in art!  You can be part of a new era in ART politics and in making a statement the visual sparks important conversation.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>The biggest risk we will run into is if we cannot meet our Tooling minimum if we can't then we simply won't be able to produce the product.</li>
<li>If for any reason we cannot meet our tooling minimum we will alert our contributors at that time with our alternative strategy on making our statues.  But, we have faith in you guys! </li>

The Impact We hope to have with our Campaign is simple:
We are in a new world of politics where things are happening that you wouldn't believe if they were written for in a sitcom or Horror film! So why not add a new era of pop culture in politics by creating some irreverence in art!  You can be part of a new era in ART politics and in making a statement the visual sparks important conversation.

Risks & Challenges

The biggest risk we will run into is if we cannot meet our Tooling minimum if we can't then we simply won't be able to produce the product.
If for any reason we cannot meet our tooling minimum we will alert our contributors at that time with our alternative strategy on making our statues.  But, we have faith in you guys!",17.0,0,"1 Campaign
