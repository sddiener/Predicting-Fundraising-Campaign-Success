<p> I’m all about the great journey of life as we don’t know it, I work from my faith and am guided through every piece of creation that is produced through it, I have written many manuscripts but only pushed my illustration side forward until now, I am also a visual artist and a portrait artist, but this time it was put on my heart to write and illustrate a picture book for children, that really touched their hearts and made them think in their language, but that was educational at the same time.</p>

<p>So as well as various places and people, I decided to also test drive a proof copy with my children’s local school. They loved it and said I should consider having it published.

<p>Of course, there are risks with being a debut author trying to release a book that is aiming for something different. The risk is fear, fear of failure, but the guarantee of success is your belief and faith in the message and this is certainly highlighted in Zalia's moral origin.</p>
<p>Love is limitless, and holds no impossibilities to ransom, with faith filled hearts in ourselves we find our supernatural identity where nothing is impossible, and everything is an open door, an opportunity, a season.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Rob, the goal is to publish a children's illustrated book titled ""A for Airplane"".  The story begins with Scotty being too scared to fly one day, Scotty visited the Airport to fly with Grandpa in his bright yellow airplane. </p>
<p>The flying adventure turned into an action-packed flight and along the way, with lots to see and learn.  Flying high and low, Scotty spots lots of things and wildlife beginning with the letter A.</p>
<p>A for airplane is not just an amusing bedtime story; with vibrant illustrations, wrapped in an engaging story-line, the book provides basic words related to the letter A and knowledge building of all things to do with an airplane.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530136456/liprwxjvaa1iqdify2xk.jpg"" src=""""/><p> </p>
<p>This is not just an entertaining, exciting bedtime story, the concept is a fun learning experience with images and a quiz to enhance the children’s alphabet learning and vocabulary,  Plus a practical choice for pretravel reading and free downloadable learning activities via <a href=""http://Scotty.Club"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Scotty.Club</a>.</p> <h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532819041/eqj8iigdmf0uzccfuxrv.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>The alphabet “Scotty Adventure Learning” transport series was literally inspired when Scotty was born too then thinking back when my parents told me that until the age of five, I could not talk leading to be diagnosed with dyslexia so I was worried with Scotty’s development.</p>
<p>As Scotty was growing up, all Scotty wanted was playing with wheels that whizz by, toys with wings flying high or toys splashing in his bath tub.  </p>
<p>With this in mind, grabbed a pen and paper and started on an alphabet journey from A to Z to encourage and aid Scotty to learn basic sounds and letters, thankfully Scotty’s speech and learning development are fine.</p>
<p>To fully bring the story-lines and sketches to life, a professional illustrator was sought, this is where I hit the funding wall, stopping the dream for Scotty to enjoy and learn all about the different transport types and basic words within an adventure book.</p>
<p>Came across, <a href=""https://igg.me/at/airplanebook"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Indiegogo.com</a>, what a brilliant idea! An amazing concept for people around the world to support and make dreams happen.</p>
<p>A for Airplane will not only bring amazing joy to Scotty but with all the families passion gone into each story-line, we are positive that children around the world will enjoy to listen and learn with Scotty learning adventure series, starting with ""A for Airplane"" book.</p>

<p>The Zorihans is a children's and youth series of three fantasy novels that brings a unique story about the creation of planet Earth, the origin of evil, who we were, where we came from, what we are and where we are going. This work gives us a new version for some historical and scientific facts, generally little known. The story mixes fiction with reality creatively, making us rethink what we know about our origins. Using mystery, suspense, action, magic, enchantment, creatures from other dimensions and new worlds, among other things. The book was written in a simple, clear and well detailed, which enables us to an enjoyable read.<br/></p>

<p>In 2011, I was fortunate able to -with great effort and with the
help of an independent Publisher que acreditou em mim- launch a small drawing,
the first volume of the trilogy ""Zórihans - The Ones Born From The
Drems"", written by me. Without funding, there was no opportunity to
advertise my work. To my surprise, despite the circulation is very small and
not having the required disclosure that the work deserved, it made great
success among those who could read it. </p>
<p>Since the launch of
the project in 2011 so far in 2015, I have received several e-mails from
children, teenagers and even some adults from Brazil and other countries like
the US, as also did online distribution, who read the first volume and crave
the two remaining volumes of the trilogy Zórihans be edited. I confess that I
was overwhelmed with the positive reviews I received on my literary work. Found
by chance on the Internet, a group of young people who were trying to recreate
the characters of Zórihans book with animated dolls. I read thrilled the
account of one of the young girls said that after reading my book, she began to
dream of being a writer and write like me.</p>

 Unfortunately
the small, independent publisher that helped me to start this project, can not
afford to continue the work of my book because they are going through financial
difficulties. They continue to help me, but can not afford the production of my
book despite believe that the continuation of the trilogy really deserves to be
published, so they advised me to try to raise funds because they think it's worth.
The major publishers in Brazil usually not bet on writers not renowned.
Although I know and have had evidence that my story is really very good, I do
not have the financial resources necessary to be able to continue my literary
project.<p></p>

<p>Klar, es gibt schon zahllose Hörbücher und -spiele, basierend auf den spannenden Fällen des Sherlock Holmes und seinem Partner John Watson. Aber keines wie dieses!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>»Der Hund der Baskervilles« oder<br/>Wie sich der Fall wirklich zutrug. </strong></h3>
<p>Nach dem vor einigen Jahren im Depot des British Museum eine Truhe aus dem Privatbesitz des John Watson wiederentdeckt und näher untersucht wurde, fand man in einem Geheimfach versteckte, bisher unbekannte Aufzeichnungen. Nach genauer Studie der offenbar eilig verfassten Schriften, stellte man fest, dass einige der von Watson seinerzeit beschriebenen Fälle sich ganz anders zutrugen, als bisher bekannt. Unter ihnen fand man einen der bekanntesten Fälle: »Der Hund der Baskervilles«.</p>
<p>Die Aufzeichnungen geben verborgenen Seiten Watsons preis, von denen wir alle nichts ahnten. Die Texte des John H. Watson erzählen von intimen Details, heimlichen Wünschen und der perfiden Grausamkeit des Täters, in einer Art, wie man sie dem viktorianischen Leser wohl nicht zuzumuten wagte. Doch jetzt, im Jahre 2018, ist die Zeit gekommen.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Wir finden, die Welt soll erfahren, wie es wirklich war! </strong></h3>
<p>Rätselhafte Ereignisse, Erotik und das höllische Jaulen eines Teufelshundes machen diese Geschichte zu einem mitreißenden Abenteuer. Woher kommt die Bestie, warum tötet sie Sir Charles, was hat es mir dem Fluch der Baskervilles auf sich? Wer kann das mörderische Monstertier stoppen? Welche Gräuel verbergen sich im düsteren Moor? Was gibt es frei und was wird es für immer in seinem tiefen Schlund gefangen halten? Zärtlichkeit und Zerstörung sind Geschwister. Watsons scheuer Herzschlag beim Blick in Henrys schönen Augen wäre beinahe sein letzter gewesen, denn die Bestie nähert sich aus Dartmoors nebeligen Tiefen… Nur der unbestechliche, klare Verstand Sherlock Holmes wird all diese Rätsel lösen. Nur er kann Watson aus der Gefahr retten, in die ihn der Meisterdetektiv selbst gebracht hat.</p>
<p>Der Autor Oliver Bokern konnte Einsicht in die geheimen Aufzeichnungen des John H. Watson nehmen und aus den sehr persönlich gehaltenen Zeilen ein spannendes Hörbuch verfassen. Bitte helft uns, es erklingen zu lassen.</p>

<p>The publication’s main mission is to provide a platform for Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour (BIPoC) from across (Colonially Known As) “Canada” to speak about the social impact of mental health through the lens of racialized experiences.</p>
<p>The project originally comes from a need to highlight more BIPoC artists and writers in the predominantly-white “Canadian” spoken word scene (especially wimmin, femmes, and folks outside the binary), as well as the social and psychological impact of mental health narratives long dominated by white supremacy.</p>
<p>Although explicitly titled and focused for BIPoC, this project also recognizes the need for welcomed inclusion LGBTQQIP2SAA, queer, genderqueer, trans, non-binary, bigender and agender representation, visibility for disabled individuals, and across intersections of all social marginalization.</p>
<p>There will be no consideration for any material embodying or representing the same hateful, discriminatory, and oppressive systems which currently exist as the object of our resistance.  This includes (but is not limited to): anti-blackness, homophobia, ableism, Islamophobia, misogyny, misogynoir, cis-sexism, transphobia, anti-Semitism, serophobia, classism, etc. Kyriarchy is a Rubik’s cube of various systems we can unlock and break down with time, patience, energy, care (for self and community), and most importantly, love as radical justice.</p>

It was pain unlike any she had ever been in before and was a fire in her limbs. At first there was no space for thought of where she was or why she was there, only the pain could be focused on. Only the pain could be given any attention at all. She wasn't sure how long it took and she wasn't sure how she managed to do it but eventually she was able to look past the pain slightly. Her breathing was ragged but passable for normal with a few deep breaths. The haze began to lift from her mind and she understood that her eyes were closed. Deciding against opening them for now she let the waves of pain be dealt with by her body as she tried to understand something of her body's condition. It was impossible. With how much she hurt there was nothing left to understand. So there she stayed, not even knowing if she was sitting or lying down, until the convulsions came. When they hit they hit hard. Every muscle in her body seemed to be dancing to its own personal tune and caused her body to ricochet around. It could have only been minutes or it could have been hours and it would have made no difference to her. Her body was out of her control. It made it hard to breathe, hard to do anything but let her limbs do what they wanted as her chest muscles contracted. When everything was finally over there was a great absence in her. At first she was relieved by the nothingness but as it continued she began to grow worried.</p><p><i>What if I died?</i></p><p>Slowly she began to try and move her fingers. It took some effort but she was able to move them and eventually feeling returned to her hands. There was dirt under her, it was moist but not so much so that she could no longer feel the individual grains of the earth and tell that there seemed to be some sand mixed in. She was also feeling the dirt on her palm and when she clutched her fingers she got some under her nails, when she flattened them again she could feel little divets in the ground where her nails had scratched lines. Where was the moisture coming from though? She began to try and twitch various muscles throughout her body so that she could return feeling to the rest of her. Slowly she began with her lower arms, and once those muscles moved she work on her upper arms. In this manner she worked her way through her entire body. She wasn’t very successful and grew somewhat despondent. What if she was broken somehow? She thought back to her hands and wondered if she could have felt what she had felt if something was seriously wrong with her. In a way she had gained good information from her hands, information she would not have thought possible to get just from your palms. She must be in a somewhat sitting and upright position if she could feel the dirt in the manner that she had felt it.</p><p>Her back came alive suddenly. Damping down her excitement she focused on what she could gleam from the information her nerves were sending her way. It was cold, hard, rough and damp. It seemed to be somewhat slimy as well since whatever she was (or was not) wearing left her back bare. Her brain seemed to take this in and it took some time to figure out what it could possibly be that she was up against.</p><p><i>Rocks of some sort?</i></p><p>Where on earth was she? Normally she did not pay this much attention to her surroundings but the odd situation had made her focus extremely hard. Truth be told, this extreme focus was available only due to the adrenaline that must be rushing through her from her fear. She should have felt herself growing mentally tired from the effort but something allowed he to keep going. She decided that it was time to open her eyes and see the place that her muscles and nerves were describing. At first they were stuck together, as if she had had them closed for a long time and the 'sleepy dust' had built up, but she was able to pry them apart with some effort. It wasn't very useful. Wherever she was it was dark. There was no light here except for a faint crack of light directly in front of her at ground level, which she had to blink a few times to be able to see properly. It was some distance away but that was all she could tell. If she was going to get to it, which is what she figured that she would need to do, she would have to be able to stand up. Unfortunately she had a feeling that if she did the pain would return. And she really did not want that. The pain and convulsions had been quite enough for her, thank you very much. Why oh why hadn't opening her eyes been more useful? It was then, as she was bemoaning her situation that she heard it. It was soft at first but once she froze and focused on the sound she could hear it clearly. A moan.</p><p><i>I'm not alone in here.”</i></p></div>","Oriana is a young woman who can remember only one thing: waking up alone in a cold, damp and dark room full of nightmares.

Damping down her excitement she focused on what she could gleam from the information her nerves were sending her way. It was cold, hard, rough and damp. It seemed to be somewhat slimy as well since whatever she was (or was not) wearing left her back bare. Her brain seemed to take this in and it took some time to figure out what it could possibly be that she was up against.Rocks of some sort?Where on earth was she? Normally she did not pay this much attention to her surroundings but the odd situation had made her focus extremely hard. Truth be told, this extreme focus was available only due to the adrenaline that must be rushing through her from her fear. She should have felt herself growing mentally tired from the effort but something allowed he to keep going. She decided that it was time to open her eyes and see the place that her muscles and nerves were describing. At first they were stuck together, as if she had had them closed for a long time and the 'sleepy dust' had built up, but she was able to pry them apart with some effort. It wasn't very useful. Wherever she was it was dark. There was no light here except for a faint crack of light directly in front of her at ground level, which she had to blink a few times to be able to see properly. It was some distance away but that was all she could tell. If she was going to get to it, which is what she figured that she would need to do, she would have to be able to stand up. Unfortunately she had a feeling that if she did the pain would return. And she really did not want that. The pain and convulsions had been quite enough for her, thank you very much. Why oh why hadn't opening her eyes been more useful? It was then, as she was bemoaning her situation that she heard it. It was soft at first but once she froze and focused on the sound she could hear it clearly. A moan.I'm not alone in here.”",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>A Cause Close to my Heart:</strong></h3>
<p>In 2002, I began my journey to fight against cancer by running for the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma’s Society Team in Training (TNT) Program (teamintraining.org). After losing my grandfather to Lymphoma in 2012, this cause became even more important to me. The passing of my grandfather drove me to write the story that had been in my heart for years.  </p>
<p>Through personal fundraising efforts, I have raised over $10,000 for the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society (L&amp;L). Last year, I successfully funded a campaign to bring Susie Tries to life and this book has inspired children across America to set high goals and accomplish them just like Susie! </p>
<p>Here are some of the many supporters of <i>Susie Tries</i> enjoying their book: </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559595874/liyk7ihyvld7ndl5kmu1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>My Goals:</h3>
<p>Now that Susie Tries is in print, I have even bigger goals for this book. First and foremost, I want to donate copies of Susie Tries to TNT chapters and participants for them to sell. All of the proceeds made from Susie Tries will then be given to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. I will also sell copies at USA triathlon events, children’s triathlons, and other events that support the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to raise additional funds for the L&amp;L Society. </p>
<p>I need $10,000 ($10 per book) in order to purchase 1,000 copies of Susie Tries to raise funds for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. </p>

<h3>How Susie TriesBegan:</h3>
<p><i>Susie Tries</i> was inspired by my triathlon coach for the TNT program in Lexington, KY, Susan Bradley Cox (<a href=""http://www.triforsight.com/about-susan/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.triforsight.com/about-susan/</a>). Susan was not only a coach but also a mentor and an inspiration to hundreds of athletes, many of whom were battling cancer. Her perseverance and determination greatly inspired me because she encouraged all those she met to never give up—a technique she faithfully practiced. </p>
<p>I carried these traits into <i>Susie Tries</i> to teach children the valuable lesson that winning does not mean coming in first; it means setting and achieving your goals! In this book, Susie races in her very first triathlon to help raise awareness about cancer. </p>
<p>Triathlons may seem like an adult sport, but they are gaining popularity among young people because they focus on three activities children understand and also love to do: swimming, riding a bike, and running. Because triathlons are an excellent example of a sport where winning is about an accomplishment, not a score, I chose this activity to teach children valuable assets such as: self-confidence, motivation, a healthy lifestyle, and compassion for others. To me, triathlons symbolize this strong will to live and the inner strength children need to succeed in life.</p>
<p>Though Susie may not win the race, she wins more than a trophy. At just eight years old, she wins by raising awareness for cancer and finishing the race! </p>

<h3>The Impact: </h3>
<p>Every day, thousands of people are battling cancer and striving to make it to the finish line. </p>
<p>Please join Susie and I in our race to fight cancer. Your contribution will inspire children to set and achieve goals while simultaneously helping raise funds in hopes of curing a cancer that has taken the lives of many.  As eight-year-old Susie would say, all you have to do is try, try, try and you can achieve your goals! </p>

The additional copies purchased through this site will need to be sent to the publisher and printed, which can take 1-2 months. Once that is complete, <i>Susie Tries</i> will be shipped to you and donated to organizations that will raise funds and awareness for Leukemia and Lymphoma. </p>

<h2>'The Stories We Write'  - community shortstory writing</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Sjaak, I live near Rotterdam (Netherlands). As publisher me and my wife have published magazines about leadership. Now we want to publish books with short stories, both fiction and non fiction, in the series ‘The Stories We Write’. </p>
<h3>The first book will be a non fiction one, .... titled ‘I am different, hope you don’t mind’.</h3>
<p>In my own contribution to this book I want to take you along on a major change in my role as a father. In 1987 I became the proud father of a son. Now, 30 years later, that son is my daughter. My child is different now, although that didn’t happen overnight. She will write about this in the first edition as one of the stories in 'The Stories We Write'.</p>
<h3>Are you different, or do you feel different ?</h3>
<p>We would like to receive more stories about people being or feeling different. Are you different from other people or have you ever felt different in any way and have you ever felt like writing that down and sharing that with others?</p>
<p>This might be an opportunity as we want to compile stories as yours. Take courage. You don’t have to be the best writer. Write from the heart and exercise your skills in the meantime. We want to publish your story.</p>
<p>It would be such a collective performance to share wonderful stories with family, friends and if possible sharing them in a wider circle. We would be most greatful if we can pursuade you to back us. </p>
<h3>How can you contribute and how will we thank you </h3>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>Write your short story on 10 pages maximum, send it in, find 10 sponsors amongst family and friends for who you purchase one book each (so 10 together).</li>
<li>We will campaign, compile the stories, print publish and ship the books to you and other backers.</li>
<li>Or back us up by purchasing one book and receive the first edition of The Stories We Write.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stretched goals</h3>
<ul><li>The Stories We Write wants to form a community of writers experienced and inexperienced to publish a title every month. The first edition is printed as a paperback. Our ambition is publishing hard cover books and color in future editions. Therefor we need fundings to reach these goals. If we reach 120% for this first pledge we will publish this in hard cover without raising the price or shipping costs.</li></ul>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>As we go for fixed crowdfunding there are <strong>no risks</strong> when we do not reach our pledge. Backers will get their money back, so there will be no losses.</p>
<p>When shipping the books we will choose to use tracking and tracing, so we will always find the goods for our backers. We will folow your order.</p>
<p>If we print and publish the books in the Netherlands, we are able to see the results and can judge  customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>To keep shipping costs as low as feasable we consider to print in both USA for local (and Canada and Australia) and Netherlands for Europe. In the perks we offer and add shipping costs. If we print in the USA the shipping costs can be lower than we offered now. We will compensate the lower costs.</p>
<p>In our proposal we have calculated and showed the costs for one book. When ordering multiple books, shipping costs are drastically cheaper. That advantage is of course entirely for the benefit of the backer. If this might go wrong on the indigogo website, we will defenitly refund this asap.</p>
<p>As we have experience with publishing magazines, sending the books will not cause any problems.</p>

<h3>Helping without having money to spend. </h3>
<p>If you have sympathy for our initiative but you cannot spend money, help us by spreading this initiative. Provide us e-mail addresses of friends and ralations (with permission) that we can send our e-mail up-date.</p>

In our proposal we have calculated and showed the costs for one book. When ordering multiple books, shipping costs are drastically cheaper. That advantage is of course entirely for the benefit of the backer. If this might go wrong on the indigogo website, we will defenitly refund this asap.
As we have experience with publishing magazines, sending the books will not cause any problems.

Helping without having money to spend.

It has gone through so many incarnations we can hardly count them, and finally it is at a stage where we're happy with where it is and where it is going. We're ready to finish this thing!</p>
<p>OFAI centers around twin girls named Yami and Ardon, whose lives are upended when they are kidnapped by a terrifying man who calls himself Ryute. Within the space of a day, everything they knew is skewed -- magic is real and they have it. They will find friends and collaborators along the way, but who can they really trust except each other? After all, blood is thicker...Right?</p>
<p>So that's our story, but who are we?</p>
<p>I'm Chelsea Howard, the first spark of this story was a short little tale I wrote about getting kidnapped. I've been obsessed with this idea ever since. Through the stages of my youth and the start of my adult life, this story has been a staple of who I am as a writer and artist. Yami, my half of the twins, is probably my most drawn and doodled character. </p>
<p>My co-author is Shannon McCosh. She's currently dealing with college and a job, so I'm going to take the liberty of introducing her. Most of OFAI's best twists and turns have come from her genius. She wrote the first half of the book, of course with lots of input and advice from me, but now that she's in college and working simultaneously, it's up to me to pull the rest of the book out of our minds and onto paper.</p>
<p>The funds from this campaign will go toward two things primarily: Chelsea's living expenses while she finishes the book, and printing costs to get the book out to you guys! With your help, the alternate reality that has lived in our heads for 13 years will finally get to live in other's minds too. With your help, our life long dreams of being published authors, of doing justice to the characters that so graciously gave us their stories...can all come true. </p> </div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div> </div><p>We've got a funding goal of $15,000. This will go to several places:</p><ul> <li>$6000: printing expenses for 300 paperbacks  and 100 hardcovers <i>if</i> we don't pick up a publisher! If we do get a publisher this expense should go down significantly.</li>
<li>$4000: My living expenses for four months, our estimate of how long it will take me to finish the book while writing full time.</li>
<li>$3000: Taxes! Assuming we get fully funded, we're planning on 20% in taxes. </li>
<li>$1000: Shannon needs a new computer as her laptop is about 7 years old and has gotten to the point of malfunction where it cannot run DropBox, which we use to keep our copies of the story available to each other.</li>
<li>$600: IndieGoGo Fees</li>
</ul><p>And what do you, our wonderful backers, get in return for your assistance? Well, a wide range of things, depending on your level of amazing.</p><ul>
<li>All levels of funding will get a copy of the book, either digital, paperback or hardback, and most levels get them autographed! (except the digital, of course. That would just be silly.)</li>
<li>Did I mention we're artists, too? Most levels get a small art print created by the authors. </li>
<li>Ever wanted your name in a book? The higher levels get their names mentioned on a thank you page in the book, and a personal thank you note from the authors.</li>
<li>Do you want to know what <i>could </i>have happened? The highest levels get an extra book of the two alternate endings to the story.</li>
<li>Want an even more personal touch? At the very highest level of funding you actually get a 30 minute Skype call with both authors. We'll answer your questions about our inspiration, our favorite books, and our plans for the future.<span> </span>

<p>As Howard Thurman once said: ""Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.""</p>

<p>Another key challenge is being able to write the book in a timely fashion. Recently, I ran a writing test day to see how much I can feasibly write in one day.

<h3>Story so far...</h3>
<p>Hello my name is Sarah Josefsberg and a couple of years ago I was diagnosed with cancer. It's ok! I made it through. What helped me most during that time was Rosie the rabbit's story which I created one night while in the middle of having chemo. I found that telling this little story to myself and sharing it with others opened up conversations and helped me connect when I was feeling completely alone.</p>
<p>Rosie's first book, Rosie The Rabbit: The Thing About Cancer opened up conversations with people I had never met and helped us get talking about cancer with families and friends and open us up to all the emotions we face. Her second book is all about coping with anxiety and stress. </p>
<p>As someone who has personally suffered from anxiety I have created this second book to help as many families and friends as possible who may know someone who is suffering. Maybe it is due to illness or maybe it's a symptom of the life we live in? Whatever the reason I have created Rosie to help connect and have those tough conversations and most important of all help chidlren feel better!</p>
<p>Somewhere out there someone needs Rosie! They don't have the words and are feeling scared and alone in life. When you support this campaign you are giving a child, parent or friend the words and help them have these important conversations. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495041306/a7qxc7opx4ot9flr6byr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Rosie The Rabbit and I have been through a lot together over this past 2 years. She hopped into my life when I was in the middle of my cancer treatment. Her first story helped me get through a really tough time and so we decided to share it with others who were touched by cancer.</p>
<p>After our first book's success Rosie decided that she would like to share more of her stories with people. Rosie wrote her stories because she knew that they would really help people to talk about their feelings when going through tough experiences in life.</p>
<p>We know this second book will make a difference, just like the first one, and really help children, parents and friends dealing with anxiety and stress.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Ok, on a personal level, it is scary putting Rosie and her campaign out into the world! I am actually asking you for money in exchange for my dream. There are 3 billion other people are on this thing selling magic juicers, e-bikes and movies. Everybody has a dream and all dreams are valid, so why in the hell are you going to give your money to me?  </p>
<p>These are the risks you take when you follow your dream... We would rather take the risk of putting this out there. We would rather rise to the challenges in life than quit, so I am asking you for your help. </p>
<p>When you donate to this campaign you sacrifice a cup of coffee, a meal or possibly a nice pair of shoes. Perhaps you are even sacrificing money for your kid's college fund, the rent or a new Bugatti? Whatever the amount, it is a sacrifice and so it needs to be worth it.</p>
<p>This is what I can guarantee you...</p>
<p>The more you give, the more good I promise to do with your money. That is the bang for your buck. Reaching this target means that we make an amazing book together and ensure its success. </p>
<p>The more copies I can print and distribute the cheaper the cost to the public and we can make more available to hospitals and other places and people that need them.</p>
<p>So, if you believe in our dream please give as much as you can with all of your heart and help us succeed!</p>

<p><strong>"" MESSI &amp; THE GOLDEN DEFEAT "" ... Football's Mysteries Seen Through THE WAIBI METHOD</strong></p>
<p><i>(Texto en <strong>Español</strong> al final)</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Actually this is a <strong><i>Bookgame</i></strong>. No! It’s not an editing mistake. It says a ""Bookgame"".</p>
<p>To understand it faster: it's like a videogame that you play reading it. In it, two characters with sometimes different and sometimes similar points of view, try to answer the big question: Who is the Best Football Player in History? The funny thing is that it’s the reader who ""plays"" Johnny Bigot and Ducky “Lucky"" Goldcoins, (a Football fan and a professional bettor). Each one of them has its own life story. So, the conclusions they will reach, will allow them to understand some hidden “secrets” of this sport from very particular points of view.</p>
<p>Although sometimes it looks like a novel or just pure science fiction, this is a book of <strong>Analysis</strong>. The “adventure” recreates many situations (sports or not) that give us other considerations to clarify our ideas about what we see, and what we ""don’t see"" in the pitch. Also it’s about <strong>how to count it</strong>.</p>
<p>The thing is that Football (as society and human civilizations) has always been submerged in that mysterious fog that interweaves mysticism with reality, desire with justice, fanaticism with sanity, and happiness with violence. Being the most popular sport in the world, maybe this is precisely the ""inexplicable"" reason to also be the one that more slowly evolves. The statistics are in that still ""primitive"" part.</p>
<p>While <strong>Waibi Football </strong>system is a revolutionary vision of this sport through the numbers, it’s at the same time a step forward in its analysis, understanding and enjoyment. Among many questions, the system brings light into those invisible areas not recorded by the conventional analysis. Thus, it evidences a part of that Football Universe so far not ignored, but ""intangible"", or at least, ""unfocused"".</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519540675/c1os6qeaodxionqmwamq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Justly, the misunderstanding of Football game is one of the causes of most kind of <strong>violence</strong> that tarnish it. Especially the one that's aimed at the own team players, referees, rival fans or media stars. I’m not talking about social vandalism (gangs, mafias, illegal bets, match-fixing, xenophobia...). I mean, that kind of violence that is a distortion of sportsmanship; even though sometimes both become the same.</p>
<p>Eroding that violence as much as possible is the supreme aim of this Bookgame. The other goals include to introduce a new perspective to the Football Stats and Analysis, and to give a practical sample of how the <strong>Waibi Method</strong> works.</p>
<p>You will be surprised by certain ""secrets"" hidden in the performance data of some of the greatest players in History such as <strong>Pelé, Maradona, Cristiano Ronaldo</strong> and logically, <strong>Messi</strong>... But you may also start to live life differently. Although also maybe not!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519540770/tvsutmx2cn3uqk0rpfv5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In any case, this Bookgame will just give you new tools to answer the big question <strong>by yourself</strong>. But the same ones will be useful to analyze any specific situation (sports or not), going through as many points of view as possible, and then filtering full data to reach more accurate conclusions. It doesn’t matter if it’s to create a mathematical algorithm, to bet, or even to “understand” politics.</p>
<p>So, are you ready to expand your way of enjoying Football?</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p><strong>OK, BUT… WHAT IS THE WAIBI METHOD?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>Waibi Method</strong> is an analysis/learning <strong>ideal system for self-educated people</strong>. Although it’s based on The Scientific Method, it focuses not only on what is recognized as Science, but on anything you master, however insignificant it might seem.</p>
<p>Somehow, most of the things you know, have some point of connection. From playing Football (Soccer) or preparing a good roast, until speaking a language, farming or simply driving a car. It's because all of them are powerfully governed by the same primordial factor: <strong>Logic</strong>! Everything we learn and experience is assimilated with the same Logic. Isn’t it? So, by Identifying, Organizing, Processing and Interpreting (<strong>DOPI</strong>) those common links you will achieve not only to accelerate your learning time, but it will increase overwhelmingly your efficacy also when you apply your knowledge.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519924830/goq6evllthzfgjp65isa.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The Waibi Method</strong> also includes other learning procedures and techniques similar to The Link Method and Feynman’s Method, but it has some advantages over those:</p>
<p>·         It occupies less space in your memory, regarding the amount of new things you can learn.</p>
<p>·         In many cases, you don’t need necessarily an academic knowledge to understand/explain certain complex situations.</p>
<p>·         It’s easy to remember what you’ve learned if you've ""forgotten"" it, or you’ve not used it for a while.</p>
<p>·         Although the result is the same (to learn something you want), each person creates their own model. That means that a peasant and an intellectual could learn the same thing, using what they already know. It will depend more on their individual capacity of abstraction.</p>
<p>·         It allows you learning very different subjects (Music and Languages, for example) using the same reference.</p>
<p>·         By mastering <strong>Waibi Method</strong> you will not only learn faster, but that learning speed will increase exponentially while you add more ""Parallel Known Universes"" (<strong>PKU</strong>) to your system.</p>
<p>So, actually, The Waibi Method<strong> is a Method of Integration of Information</strong>. Philosophically, ""Information"" refers to ""Everything that exists"". In practice, it refers to ""everything you know"".  </p>

<p><strong>SO… WHY IS IMPORTANT YOUR HELP?</strong></p>
<p>As you’ve already noticed this is an indie book. Each publishing house has a budget that allows to produce their materials. Authors, consultants, editors, designers, illustrators, proofreaders, translators, printers, publishers and divulgers, are linked in a chain that ensures that the book message hit the reader. For that reason, an Indie author can’t ignore any of this phases. The quality must be the same!</p>
<p>This book will be published first in <strong>English</strong> and <strong>Spanish</strong>. This complicates everything, because my aim is to launch it<strong> before the next World Cup in Russia 2018</strong>.</p>
<p>Obviously, it would be really useful to promote the book once concluded. My idea is also to try to get access to some of the European Universities and Book Fairs, to give a good first step.</p>
<p>As you already have noticed, by the standards of production, the amount I’m asking for it's insufficient for this really big work, if we think about the time remaining for the World Cup. However, as I assume many of the functions (editing, design, co - translation, illustration, and others) I just need to invest in those areas that are beyond my possibilities, due to logistic or economic issues.</p>
<p>Translation is a neuralgic point, especially because it needs time. I also need some language advisory. Why? Because one thing is speaking and writing in formal annoying language, and quite another one is to write a book in a style as colloquial as a conversation between friends about… statistics!!! So, I need a ""mother tongue"" advisory to review the whole “little” details.</p>
<p>There’re also some images, protected by copyright, so I need to cover the corresponding amount to the authors, in order to comply with the law.</p>
<p>Besides, this book have three versions per language:</p>
<p>1.    eBook Edition (digital)</p>
<p>2.    Standard Edition (paper)</p>
<p>3.    Special Edition (paper)</p>
<p>That means a harder design work. Definitely I will need to contract some people, because of the time remaining until the World Cup.</p>
<p>Different versions means to pay different ISBN too. </p>
<p>An unexpected problem is that Amazon, the platform I chose to sell the book, it changed its publishing policy at the end of 2017. So, there's not free publications anymore. Just this ""detail"" it will cost us about the 20% of the amount!</p>
<p>Also the book is accompanied by the song you heard on the spot. That’s the demo of my  song ""Hurricane Messi"". There’re certain parts of the song that I’ve to record in a studio. Especially those with acoustic instruments.  </p>
<p>Anyhow, the book is really quite advanced, including translation. But as you can see, <strong>it’s a great challenge</strong>, therefore I need your help! So,<strong> let’s do it?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>“MESSI Y EL ORO DE LA DERROTA”... Los Misterios del Futbol a través del MÉTODO WAIBI</strong></p>

</div></div>",""" MESSI & THE GOLDEN DEFEAT "" ... Football's Mysteries Seen Through THE WAIBI METHOD
(Texto en Español al final)
 
Actually this is a Bookgame. No! It’s not an editing mistake. It says a ""Bookgame"".
To understand it faster: it's like a videogame that you play reading it. In it, two characters with sometimes different and sometimes similar points of view, try to answer the big question: Who is the Best Football Player in History? The funny thing is that it’s the reader who ""plays"" Johnny Bigot and Ducky “Lucky"" Goldcoins, (a Football fan and a professional bettor). Each one of them has its own life story. So, the conclusions they will reach, will allow them to understand some hidden “secrets” of this sport from very particular points of view.
Although sometimes it looks like a novel or just pure science fiction, this is a book of Analysis. The “adventure” recreates many situations (sports or not) that give us other considerations to clarify our ideas about what we see, and what we ""don’t see"" in the pitch. Also it’s about how to count it.
The thing is that Football (as society and human civilizations) has always been submerged in that mysterious fog that interweaves mysticism with reality, desire with justice, fanaticism with sanity, and happiness with violence. Being the most popular sport in the world, maybe this is precisely the ""inexplicable"" reason to also be the one that more slowly evolves. The statistics are in that still ""primitive"" part.
While Waibi Football system is a revolutionary vision of this sport through the numbers, it’s at the same time a step forward in its analysis, understanding and enjoyment. Among many questions, the system brings light into those invisible areas not recorded by the conventional analysis. Thus, it evidences a part of that Football Universe so far not ignored, but ""intangible"", or at least, ""unfocused"".

Justly, the misunderstanding of Football game is one of the causes of most kind of violence that tarnish it. Especially the one that's aimed at the own team players, referees, rival fans or media stars. I’m not talking about social vandalism (gangs, mafias, illegal bets, match-fixing, xenophobia...). I mean, that kind of violence that is a distortion of sportsmanship; even though sometimes both become the same.
Eroding that violence as much as possible is the supreme aim of this Bookgame. The other goals include to introduce a new perspective to the Football Stats and Analysis, and to give a practical sample of how the Waibi Method works.
You will be surprised by certain ""secrets"" hidden in the performance data of some of the greatest players in History such as Pelé, Maradona, Cristiano Ronaldo and logically, Messi... But you may also start to live life differently. Although also maybe not!

In any case, this Bookgame will just give you new tools to answer the big question by yourself. But the same ones will be useful to analyze any specific situation (sports or not), going through as many points of view as possible, and then filtering full data to reach more accurate conclusions. It doesn’t matter if it’s to create a mathematical algorithm, to bet, or even to “understand” politics.
So, are you ready to expand your way of enjoying Football?
 
OK, BUT… WHAT IS THE WAIBI METHOD?
The Waibi Method is an analysis/learning ideal system for self-educated people. Although it’s based on The Scientific Method, it focuses not only on what is recognized as Science, but on anything you master, however insignificant it might seem.
Somehow, most of the things you know, have some point of connection. From playing Football (Soccer) or preparing a good roast, until speaking a language, farming or simply driving a car. It's because all of them are powerfully governed by the same primordial factor: Logic! Everything we learn and experience is assimilated with the same Logic. Isn’t it? So, by Identifying, Organizing, Processing and Interpreting (DOPI) those common links you will achieve not only to accelerate your learning time, but it will increase overwhelmingly your efficacy also when you apply your knowledge.

The Waibi Method also includes other learning procedures and techniques similar to The Link Method and Feynman’s Method, but it has some advantages over those:
·         It occupies less space in your memory, regarding the amount of new things you can learn.
·         In many cases, you don’t need necessarily an academic knowledge to understand/explain certain complex situations.
·         It’s easy to remember what you’ve learned if you've ""forgotten"" it, or you’ve not used it for a while.
·         Although the result is the same (to learn something you want), each person creates their own model. That means that a peasant and an intellectual could learn the same thing, using what they already know. It will depend more on their individual capacity of abstraction.
·         It allows you learning very different subjects (Music and Languages, for example) using the same reference.
·         By mastering Waibi Method you will not only learn faster, but that learning speed will increase exponentially while you add more ""Parallel Known Universes"" (PKU) to your system.
So, actually, The Waibi Method is a Method of Integration of Information. Philosophically, ""Information"" refers to ""Everything that exists"". In practice, it refers to ""everything you know"".  

 
SO… WHY IS IMPORTANT YOUR HELP?
As you’ve already noticed this is an indie book. Each publishing house has a budget that allows to produce their materials. Authors, consultants, editors, designers, illustrators, proofreaders, translators, printers, publishers and divulgers, are linked in a chain that ensures that the book message hit the reader. For that reason, an Indie author can’t ignore any of this phases. The quality must be the same!
This book will be published first in English and Spanish. This complicates everything, because my aim is to launch it before the next World Cup in Russia 2018.
Obviously, it would be really useful to promote the book once concluded. My idea is also to try to get access to some of the European Universities and Book Fairs, to give a good first step.
As you already have noticed, by the standards of production, the amount I’m asking for it's insufficient for this really big work, if we think about the time remaining for the World Cup. However, as I assume many of the functions (editing, design, co - translation, illustration, and others) I just need to invest in those areas that are beyond my possibilities, due to logistic or economic issues.
Translation is a neuralgic point, especially because it needs time. I also need some language advisory. Why? Because one thing is speaking and writing in formal annoying language, and quite another one is to write a book in a style as colloquial as a conversation between friends about… statistics!!! So, I need a ""mother tongue"" advisory to review the whole “little” details.
There’re also some images, protected by copyright, so I need to cover the corresponding amount to the authors, in order to comply with the law.
Besides, this book have three versions per language:
1.    eBook Edition (digital)
2.    Standard Edition (paper)
3.    Special Edition (paper)
That means a harder design work. Definitely I will need to contract some people, because of the time remaining until the World Cup.
Different versions means to pay different ISBN too. 
An unexpected problem is that Amazon, the platform I chose to sell the book, it changed its publishing policy at the end of 2017. So, there's not free publications anymore. Just this ""detail"" it will cost us about the 20% of the amount!
Also the book is accompanied by the song you heard on the spot. That’s the demo of my  song ""Hurricane Messi"". There’re certain parts of the song that I’ve to record in a studio. Especially those with acoustic instruments.  
Anyhow, the book is really quite advanced, including translation. But as you can see, it’s a great challenge, therefore I need your help! So, let’s do it?

<h3>What is it about?</h3>
<p>The Faceless Ones is a book that comprises of details from everyday lives of several North Korean defectors who lived in different parts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Through their testimonies, despite coming from various walks of life, we can see how they all experienced the iron grip of the North Korean regime in different ways.</p>
<p>By highlighting these accounts, we hope to have more people acknowledge the prevalent human rights violations in North Korea. This would increase the global awareness and create a platform for people to learn and engage in discussions on these issues, while simultaneously encouraging North Koreans defectors that each of their stories and experiences have significance.</p>
</div><div><h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Who are we?</span></h3></div><div>
<p>PSCORE stands for People for Successful COrean REunification. We are a non-profit NGO based in Seoul, South Korea, that addresses potential barriers to reunification and assists North Korean refugees in adapting to life in South Korea. PSCORE was founded in 2006 by Kim Young-Il, a former North Korean soldier, who managed to escape the country with his family and successfully defect to the South.</p>
<p>Today, PSCORE is working towards its goal of a successful reunification through public exposure and various enrichment programs, such as our Mentoring and Education Program and our Human Rights and Democracy Program. We also provide emergency aid to North Korean refugees in China through a discreet and secure series of networks, and all of our programs are designed to garner support and raise awareness of human rights violations in North Korea.</p>
<p>Through our education program, we make use of an extensive network of volunteer tutors in Seoul and match them with North Korean students.

""To be honest, in North Korea, there isn't a word such as stress. In retrospect, however, I think all their illnesses were due to stress.""  - Ok Ju (Nurse, Neurosurgery Department)
""Once a week, we instruct students to criticize one another This is because there is no one without flaws. By doing this, we helped them correct each other's flaws."" Soo Young, Kim (Math teacher)
The purpose of the #FaceMore campaign is to present the new version of our published book The Faceless Ones. 
What is it about?
The Faceless Ones is a book that comprises of details from everyday lives of several North Korean defectors who lived in different parts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Through their testimonies, despite coming from various walks of life, we can see how they all experienced the iron grip of the North Korean regime in different ways.
By highlighting these accounts, we hope to have more people acknowledge the prevalent human rights violations in North Korea. This would increase the global awareness and create a platform for people to learn and engage in discussions on these issues, while simultaneously encouraging North Koreans defectors that each of their stories and experiences have significance.
Who are we?
PSCORE stands for People for Successful COrean REunification. We are a non-profit NGO based in Seoul, South Korea, that addresses potential barriers to reunification and assists North Korean refugees in adapting to life in South Korea. PSCORE was founded in 2006 by Kim Young-Il, a former North Korean soldier, who managed to escape the country with his family and successfully defect to the South.
Today, PSCORE is working towards its goal of a successful reunification through public exposure and various enrichment programs, such as our Mentoring and Education Program and our Human Rights and Democracy Program. We also provide emergency aid to North Korean refugees in China through a discreet and secure series of networks, and all of our programs are designed to garner support and raise awareness of human rights violations in North Korea.
Through our education program, we make use of an extensive network of volunteer tutors in Seoul and match them with North Korean students. The students get support from our program as they develop their skills in a range of subjects such as English, Math, Essay writing and more. Furthermore, they also use this opportunity to interact with people from around the world and gain knowledge about cultural norms and practices. Our program helps defectors adjust to the South Korean education system and enhances their abilities to communicate and convey their ideas in a range of situations, both interpersonal and in the workplace.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I am Pietro, from Love with Italy. I live in Delft, NL, where I work as a researcher in a little startup called Circularise doing blockchain stuff around the circular economy.</p>
<p>I studied Philosophy, Logic, and did some research in Artificial Intelligence before taking an artsy break and working out the idea for this book in January 2018. I've been working on the paintings since 2013; the storyboards came into existence this January following a burst of inspiration. </p>

<p>I've been painting, gardening, making furniture, writing poetry, sometimes even songs, hiking, reading, listening to music and writing books for a long time now. But this is the first time I paint a book.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>The book explaining itself would say: ""I'm convoluted"". It's not the kind of book you read to your kids, it's not the kind of book you read to your mother, it's not the kind of book you read. It's the kind of book you admire, you look at, but if you want to go further, you can also stare at it in disbelief for a moment. If you're dedicated, it's the kind of book you could take to a lab and vivisect under an x-ray lamp, chalking notes down on a blackboard as you go. It's a book you can decode. (It is possible, I swear).</span></p>

<p>This project is the outcome of a realisation, namely that the paintings I made in these years, while not following an intentional storyline, follow the footprints of my personal evolution in a time of great difficulty and change. It's a diary of the unconscious. And a weird one at that.</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If you haven't figured it out yet, the funding will go into making this book a reality. This essentially means paying myself a couple of months' worth of time (a week per month, more or less, until January 2019) to devote to this project, paying, when necessary, professionals to help me with it because let's be honest, I'm a jack of all trades but, really only almost all trades.<br/>The final goal is a production line ready to churn out boxes of copies of the book (and a few hundred copies for those of you who choose one of them juicy perks).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534840832/hqho5ur60vy0b2olrvj1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If I only raise the minimum, I'm going to do just this. If I raise twice as much, I'm going to do so much more but it's a secret.</p>
<p>I'm the perfectionist &amp; control freak kind of guy when it comes to stuff I make, so I'll want the best of the best: the real thick, feely nice paper, quality binding, and to sum it up: the kind of little book you can enjoy without even understanding all of it. Especially useful for those who won't even bother trying. Also for this reason, there is going to be no digital version.</p>

<p>For the lazy people, who, for whatever reason, are keen on <i>reading</i> the books they buy, there's a ""lazy, boring version"" perk, which includes a little ugly side booklet containing the translations of all code. Also keep in mind that if you know me personally, or live in the Delft or Turin areas, there might be secret perks (e.g. without shipping costs) in for you. Ask me!</p>

<p>Fun fact: I'm a fan of Easter eggs and little details nobody notices. I'm the kind of person who could write a little symbol on the inside of the endcap - where you might find it only if you hack the book apart. Please feel free to. But don't. Books are precious.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>If I'm successful, all of you will have your very own, unique hardcopy of the book, and, if we're lucky, some editor will notice it and offer to publish it via the old school channels. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533585989/aj6hrz6htkho3dzy1mfg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Depending on how much money I raise, I have the means to extend on the material I already have.

</div></div>","I am Pietro, from Love with Italy. I live in Delft, NL, where I work as a researcher in a little startup called Circularise doing blockchain stuff around the circular economy.
I studied Philosophy, Logic, and did some research in Artificial Intelligence before taking an artsy break and working out the idea for this book in January 2018. I've been working on the paintings since 2013; the storyboards came into existence this January following a burst of inspiration. 

I've been painting, gardening, making furniture, writing poetry, sometimes even songs, hiking, reading, listening to music and writing books for a long time now. But this is the first time I paint a book.
The book explaining itself would say: ""I'm convoluted"". It's not the kind of book you read to your kids, it's not the kind of book you read to your mother, it's not the kind of book you read. It's the kind of book you admire, you look at, but if you want to go further, you can also stare at it in disbelief for a moment. If you're dedicated, it's the kind of book you could take to a lab and vivisect under an x-ray lamp, chalking notes down on a blackboard as you go. It's a book you can decode. (It is possible, I swear).

This project is the outcome of a realisation, namely that the paintings I made in these years, while not following an intentional storyline, follow the footprints of my personal evolution in a time of great difficulty and change. It's a diary of the unconscious. And a weird one at that.
 

What I Need & What You Get
If you haven't figured it out yet, the funding will go into making this book a reality. This essentially means paying myself a couple of months' worth of time (a week per month, more or less, until January 2019) to devote to this project, paying, when necessary, professionals to help me with it because let's be honest, I'm a jack of all trades but, really only almost all trades.The final goal is a production line ready to churn out boxes of copies of the book (and a few hundred copies for those of you who choose one of them juicy perks).

If I only raise the minimum, I'm going to do just this. If I raise twice as much, I'm going to do so much more but it's a secret.
I'm the perfectionist & control freak kind of guy when it comes to stuff I make, so I'll want the best of the best: the real thick, feely nice paper, quality binding, and to sum it up: the kind of little book you can enjoy without even understanding all of it. Especially useful for those who won't even bother trying. Also for this reason, there is going to be no digital version.

For the lazy people, who, for whatever reason, are keen on reading the books they buy, there's a ""lazy, boring version"" perk, which includes a little ugly side booklet containing the translations of all code. Also keep in mind that if you know me personally, or live in the Delft or Turin areas, there might be secret perks (e.g. without shipping costs) in for you. Ask me!

Fun fact: I'm a fan of Easter eggs and little details nobody notices. I'm the kind of person who could write a little symbol on the inside of the endcap - where you might find it only if you hack the book apart. Please feel free to. But don't. Books are precious.
 

The Goal
If I'm successful, all of you will have your very own, unique hardcopy of the book, and, if we're lucky, some editor will notice it and offer to publish it via the old school channels. 

Depending on how much money I raise, I have the means to extend on the material I already have. I have painted so far 100+ paintings in the ""Blue Hood"" series, but the book covers (and storifies) only around 30 of them. 60 pages of code and fantasy seemed enough. But if I raise enough money, I may have the time to write the remaining two volumes and make a pretty triad. Or a big monad. Or something yet cooler, that's both one and three, but I don't want to infringe any copyright there.
The book that I aim to publish is not just a pretty, complex little object. It does have a bunch of deeper layers of meaning but you just have to discover these for yourself.

Risks & Challenges
The funds I gather with this round will take the book to as far as possible, the limit being Mars (#WaitingForElon). If, however, it won't suffice, I'll keep at it for the years to come, funding it myself or running another round, or who knows. Obviously, the funds can scale up (and a bit down) depending on how many copies I need to print: the more funds, the more copies I'll be able to print and ship and stuff.

I'll do my best to fulfill my promises, repaying trust with commitment, that by the way I already have. But, you know, get in sooner for a better price if that's what tickles your ticklers.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is my first book! Hello I am Alex Pace, I have served many years in the US Army at every level from Private to Company Commander and continue to serve in the reserve. I have been fascinated from childhood by the stories of King Arthur and his Knights as well as the historical stories of the real people they were modeled after. The series I am writing aims to create a world similar to our own that harnesses the characteristics of these tales but adds the humanity and struggle every modern warrior faces both on, off, and long after the battlefield has left them behind.</p>
<p>Like the Soldiers in any war the Politicians make the rules. These books will explore the complexity of these decisions through the eyes of warriors who fight the battles across each Kingdom as they struggle for position and dominance , some with morals and some without. More commonly, the area is gray.</p>
<p>I need your help to tell this story!</p>
<p>Editing and publishing will cost a heavy purse. I need to raise roughly $3000 to put this book onto shelves. This cost includes editing (Professional editing, I've already done 3 rounds from friends) Formatting, paper and Kindle, cover work, printing, and marketing help.</p>
<p>What do you get out of it?!</p>
<p>$300- Awarded only once. Includes a 3D printed model of the town of Southerland painted by me.

Mankind has been observing the ships for thousands of years, just not understanding what they have been seeing. It is still the same today, most people look at clouds overhead and see nothing. The official Disclosure is now being given to reveal to Mankind at large what to look for and why. It is being given in an informational form rather than an announcement, showing you exactly where and how to see them. It is also being disseminated to you gradually as a soft revelation in the form of a website and book so as to not create a severe culture shock which would destabilize society forever.</div><div> </div><p>The reason for this specific Indiegogo campaign is that the book is currently printed on demand in full color on a laser printer by Amazon.com. Consequently, the retail price is prohibitive, over $75.00. This puts it out of the reach of all but the most ardent UFO enthusiast.  The other disadvantage is that laser printing tends to darken the color blue. Since nearly all of the photographs in the Disclosure are of sky images, this somewhat spoils the effect. The only advantage to the print on demand form of production is that the books are not paid for in advance, only as they become ordered one by one.  The prohibitive cost is the main problem.</p><p>Because of its importance, this is a book everyone should be able to enjoy. The solution is to print it in large quantities by normal offset printing. But which has to be paid for in advance. This will both correct the sky color problem providing a brilliant breathtaking book for everyone's lifetime enjoyment, plus it will lower the retail list price down to a comfortable $29.95 which nearly anyone can afford.</p><p>The funds will also be used to cover the cost of marketing and promotion, including travel costs to book signings promotions and other venues. Any amount you can contribute, large or small will be greatly appreciated. If you are still not certain about the project, please view the whole Disclosure at website <a href=""http://www.radionics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.radionics.com</a>.</p><p>The idea of a UFO based Crowdfunding campaign is not far-fetched. So-called UFOs have recently become a big Crowdfunding topic. Dr. Steven Greer ran a campaign last year to raise funds to market and promote a film and book pressuring authorities into admitting what they know about UFOs. The Campaign raised over $700,000. Similarly, the  American Rock Musician Tom Delong was recently involved with a Campaign which raised nearly a million and a half dollars to expand efforts to uncover the truth about UFOs. Given the amounts of monies involved, the subject of UFOs is obviously not a trivial matter in the minds of many. The ready to go Radionic Ship Disclosure of this campaign is far far ahead of the others in significance in that it is, in fact, the very uncovered truth they are urgently seeking.</p><p>For those of you who are still not sure, please see a review of the Book, 'The Radionic Ships of the Heavenly host' taken from Google Books, at:  <a href=""http://www.radionicships.com/review.shtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.radionicships.com/review.shtml</a>.</p><p>Also, see a bio of this author/wordsmith at:  <a href=""https://books.google.ca/books?id=tkPrtAEACAAJ&amp;dq=Radionic+Ships&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP8e6zkZXcAhVxtlkKHdgRAgkQ6AEIMDAB"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://books.google.ca/books?id=tkPrtAEACAAJ&amp;a...</a><br/><br/>Thank you and bless,<br/><br/>Delahnnovahh-Starr Livingstone</p></div>","Most people would like to believe that Man is not alone and that there is other life out there.

It is also being disseminated to you gradually as a soft revelation in the form of a website and book so as to not create a severe culture shock which would destabilize society forever. The reason for this specific Indiegogo campaign is that the book is currently printed on demand in full color on a laser printer by Amazon.com. Consequently, the retail price is prohibitive, over $75.00. This puts it out of the reach of all but the most ardent UFO enthusiast.  The other disadvantage is that laser printing tends to darken the color blue. Since nearly all of the photographs in the Disclosure are of sky images, this somewhat spoils the effect. The only advantage to the print on demand form of production is that the books are not paid for in advance, only as they become ordered one by one.  The prohibitive cost is the main problem.Because of its importance, this is a book everyone should be able to enjoy. The solution is to print it in large quantities by normal offset printing. But which has to be paid for in advance. This will both correct the sky color problem providing a brilliant breathtaking book for everyone's lifetime enjoyment, plus it will lower the retail list price down to a comfortable $29.95 which nearly anyone can afford.The funds will also be used to cover the cost of marketing and promotion, including travel costs to book signings promotions and other venues. Any amount you can contribute, large or small will be greatly appreciated. If you are still not certain about the project, please view the whole Disclosure at website www.radionics.com.The idea of a UFO based Crowdfunding campaign is not far-fetched. So-called UFOs have recently become a big Crowdfunding topic. Dr. Steven Greer ran a campaign last year to raise funds to market and promote a film and book pressuring authorities into admitting what they know about UFOs. The Campaign raised over $700,000. Similarly, the  American Rock Musician Tom Delong was recently involved with a Campaign which raised nearly a million and a half dollars to expand efforts to uncover the truth about UFOs. Given the amounts of monies involved, the subject of UFOs is obviously not a trivial matter in the minds of many. The ready to go Radionic Ship Disclosure of this campaign is far far ahead of the others in significance in that it is, in fact, the very uncovered truth they are urgently seeking.For those of you who are still not sure, please see a review of the Book, 'The Radionic Ships of the Heavenly host' taken from Google Books, at:  http://www.radionicships.com/review.shtml.Also, see a bio of this author/wordsmith at:  https://books.google.ca/books?id=tkPrtAEACAAJ&a...Thank you and bless,Delahnnovahh-Starr Livingstone",2.0,1,"2 Campaigns

EI)- General Ability to understand and control emotions Spelled out:“Emotional Intelligence…lies in…(1) knowing how to recognize your own emotions, (2) knowing how to control those emotions, (3) knowing how to recognize emotions in other people, (4) and knowing how to handle those emotions” -Lee Nicole Salinis, Quoted from They Drive Me Nuts!EQ in Action:Recognize, Understand, Manage & Influence Emotions  *See also info graph for more definitions on what Emotional Intelligence is.*Who am I? And What do I know?      My name Lee Nicole Salinis, I am The Author of They Drive Me Nuts!, have B. A. in Psychology, and am teacher qualified through Hawai’i CANOES registry. I have worked in child care since the age of 12  and have educated over one hundred children in both Hawai’i and Pennsylvania. My mission is simply Emotion Understood. More complexly, to rise as many EQ’s as possible.     As a Preschool teacher I noticed the importance of Emotional Intelligence, as well as the lack of education available for most parents on the subject. This Inspired Me to write my book: They Drive Me Nuts! 7 ways to build positive relationships with your children by getting to know yourself.So Why a magazine?     Realizing the need for Emotional Intelligence extended well beyond the home and classroom as well as beyond my own expertise, I created a Collaboration of Authorities to simplify Emotional Intelligence for Parents, Professionals and Students. So began Emotional Intelligence Magazine. What do we need?     To be able to pay amazing people a decent salary to help Make Emotional Understanding Easy we need funds.

<h2 align=""left""><b>How the idea came about</b></h2>
<h2>
</h2>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>We are Elise Billiard and Virginia Monteforte, two migrants having made Malta our home.</p>
<p>We probably met because we are both anthropologists deeply concerned 
with issues pertaining to migration. Living in Malta, in the centre of 
the Mediterranean,
at the border of ""fortress"" Europe, we have had a privileged vantage 
point from which to view the changing social and political dynamics that
 have came about due to the  <span>arrivals of boat people in Malta since 2001. </span></p>
<p>We faced the distress of asylum seekers landing in Malta after a gruelling journey, and we faced the reactions of fear and anger in casual conversations, in newspaper articles, and in the online comments sections of these same articles. <br/></p>
<p>As migrants ourselves, we thought we could do something to balance out this ever-growing tension.<br/></p>
<p>So,<b> we wanted to show that as migrants, whether expatriates, refugees, third country nationals, undocumented asylum seekers or EU citizens we all have something in common. </b>We wanted
to <b>dismantle the stereotypes</b> that reduce the word 'migrant' to what is labelled
as “illegal immigration”. <br/></p>
<p>We are all newcomers, looking for a home. And in today's world, most of us are, or will be, migrants, even if it's just for a short period of our lives.<br/></p>
<p>And so this was how RIMA was born...<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">from the desire to hear all, and not just some, of our stories.</span></p>
<br/>
<h2>
<b>The RIMA Project in brief</b><br/>
</h2>
<p>RIMA is an anthropological and
artistic project aiming at deconstructing the notion of mobility and
immobility.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>
<b>What does RIMA mean?</b><br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Rima* (n.f.)<br/>
plur. rimi</p>
<p>– Swell, wake made by a vessel in motion</p>
<p>– Rhyme</p>
<p>Rima is a Maltese word meaning the wake left behind by a boat on the 
surface of the sea. It evokes, then, something which happened in the 
past but whose effects we can still perceive in traces; a wire on the 
water which we can trace back to its origin. It also means, simply, 
‘rhyme’ – the return of similar sounds though by different words.That’s
 why our project has this name. It aims to collect different narratives 
which however still originate from the same feeling of departure, 
detachment, settlement’s desire.</p>
<p>* thanks go to poet Adrian Grima for suggesting the title.</p>
<br/>
<p><b style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">The actions</b><br/></p>
<p>The RIMA project has three actions: a film festival, a theatrical adaptation of the stories collected by us and the publication of a book of these same stories.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>1- The film festival </b>was a great success last November (and we hope to organise more in the years to come!).

<h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>
<p>Sharing the stories that we, migrants, carry with us is a first step to enable discussion. Today in Malta there are quite a few journalists speaking about the migrant issue, but still <b>very little has been done <i>with</i> migrants</b>. Most photographs, most literature is done<i> on</i> migrants. But what we are doing (Virginia and Elise) is something <i>with</i> migrants. There is no ""us"" and ""them"".<br/></p>
<p>We believe that through this simple project we can help people in Malta and outside of Malta, convince themselves that migration is a common situation, which is extensively demanding and increasingly widespread. <br/></p>
<p>What does it mean to be a migrant? Are we always moving when we are reduced to the identity of ""migrant""? When do we cease do be migrants and become a locals? Is it just a matter of legal recognition or is it implying also, and above all, a deeper, affective, long-term awareness about this new place that we can call home? What is home for you?<br/></p>
<p>“The ideal place for me is one in which it feels most natural to live as a stranger”, the Italian author Calvino stresses in Hermit in Paris<i><b><em></em></b></i>,
 reminding us how “home” is never a concept at rest, and its walls and 
grounds are far wider and multifaceted than we may believe.<br/></p>Supporting this project means supporting the idea that everyone has the right to be heard, locals or foreigners.<br/><br/><i><b>Supporting RIMA is considering that once a migrant finds his/her home, he is not a migrant anymore.

<h2><b>Risks and challenges</b></h2>
Speaking about migration today is not an easy thing.

How the idea came about


Hi!
We are Elise Billiard and Virginia Monteforte, two migrants having made Malta our home.
We probably met because we are both anthropologists deeply concerned 
with issues pertaining to migration. Living in Malta, in the centre of 
the Mediterranean,
at the border of ""fortress"" Europe, we have had a privileged vantage 
point from which to view the changing social and political dynamics that
 have came about due to the  arrivals of boat people in Malta since 2001. 
We faced the distress of asylum seekers landing in Malta after a gruelling journey, and we faced the reactions of fear and anger in casual conversations, in newspaper articles, and in the online comments sections of these same articles. 
As migrants ourselves, we thought we could do something to balance out this ever-growing tension.
So, we wanted to show that as migrants, whether expatriates, refugees, third country nationals, undocumented asylum seekers or EU citizens we all have something in common. We wanted
to dismantle the stereotypes that reduce the word 'migrant' to what is labelled
as “illegal immigration”. 
We are all newcomers, looking for a home. And in today's world, most of us are, or will be, migrants, even if it's just for a short period of our lives.
And so this was how RIMA was born...from the desire to hear all, and not just some, of our stories.


The RIMA Project in brief

RIMA is an anthropological and
artistic project aiming at deconstructing the notion of mobility and
immobility.


What does RIMA mean?


Rima* (n.f.)
plur. rimi
– Swell, wake made by a vessel in motion
– Rhyme
Rima is a Maltese word meaning the wake left behind by a boat on the 
surface of the sea. It evokes, then, something which happened in the 
past but whose effects we can still perceive in traces; a wire on the 
water which we can trace back to its origin. It also means, simply, 
‘rhyme’ – the return of similar sounds though by different words.That’s
 why our project has this name. It aims to collect different narratives 
which however still originate from the same feeling of departure, 
detachment, settlement’s desire.
* thanks go to poet Adrian Grima for suggesting the title.

The actions
The RIMA project has three actions: a film festival, a theatrical adaptation of the stories collected by us and the publication of a book of these same stories.

1- The film festival was a great success last November (and we hope to organise more in the years to come!). You can read more about this first strand of the Rima project, by clicking here: https://rimaprojectblog.wordpress.com/filmfesti...





2- The theatrical adaptation of the stories collected will be held on the 26th and 27th of February 2016. A team of professional actors has been working with non-professional and foreign actors, under the supervision and following the inspiration of theatre director Marcelle Teuma.




3- We need your help to complete the last part of our project: the writing 
and publication of our book which will retrace the inspiring journeys of
 the 20 people we interviewed last year. We intend to launch the book at the end of May 2016 and deliver it to you at the beginning of June 2016.








What we need and what you get


We need 1,365€ to be able to design and print the 200 copies of our the RIMA book. In addition we need 135€ to cover the extra fees that Indiegogo and PayPal require. This is why we are asking for 1,500€.
The project as a whole has been endorsed and partially funded by The Malta Art Funds; Malta arts Council and the Valletta 2018 Foundation. The film festival also enabled  the general public to come and support our efforts by paying for a festival ticket. But now  we find ourselves in need of extra help to complete the book. The book will be an original publication of the stories we collected, with an unconventional design and unique binding. We are working on it at this very moment.
In the coming weeks, we will be posting our progress and you will be able to see the book grow!


The Impact
Sharing the stories that we, migrants, carry with us is a first step to enable discussion. Today in Malta there are quite a few journalists speaking about the migrant issue, but still very little has been done with migrants. Most photographs, most literature is done on migrants. But what we are doing (Virginia and Elise) is something with migrants. There is no ""us"" and ""them"".

Is it just a matter of legal recognition or is it implying also, and above all, a deeper, affective, long-term awareness about this new place that we can call home? What is home for you?
“The ideal place for me is one in which it feels most natural to live as a stranger”, the Italian author Calvino stresses in Hermit in Paris,
 reminding us how “home” is never a concept at rest, and its walls and 
grounds are far wider and multifaceted than we may believe.Supporting this project means supporting the idea that everyone has the right to be heard, locals or foreigners.Supporting RIMA is considering that once a migrant finds his/her home, he is not a migrant anymore. So what is he/she then?A settler? Supporting RIMA is also accepting the idea to be surprised by what you will be discovering in this book. Because each story is unique.                        

Risks and challenges
Speaking about migration today is not an easy thing. However our background in anthropology, sociology and literature, as much as our deep comprehension of the Maltese society, has enable us to carefully choose our words and to listen with attention to the multitude of stories that have been generously given to us.This is a political project because discussing urgent and hotly debated issues is always political. But the RIMA project is not affiliated to any political party, and neither are we. (Elise Billiard and Virginia Monteforte as project managers).

Other ways to support Rima
We would be grateful if you could spread the word around...our project needs all the exposure it can get.
You can use Indiegogo's tools to make it easier to spread the word!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a guy born in Nebraska. After many years of traveling and some that might be considered difficult, it took 25 years since birth to be comfortable sharing my experiences through life in writings. I have a background in physical labor, technical work with my hands, and even tried a little of the sales life but who wants to be there forever? Writing has been a type of therapy for me already and I hope to provide that same sense, in any measure big or small, to people reading as an indirect goal to writing. I want to provide the world with a much lighter, relateable and more understandable definition of what it means to be weird.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Any money raised through here will be put towards a website first and foremost, it will provide a way to share works that I want to be available to the public, at least to the community of people that want it. This will include site setup, maintenance costs, etc. I can make that happen with a few hundred dollars. I have to set my dog a limit of no more than $30 for dog treats though so please keep requests meant for him to a minimum, he struggles with his weight sometimes but we are working together to remain active and healthy. His name is Dually. He follows his dream of one day being able to sniff all the dog butts in the world. I think it would mean a lot to him, he only speaks in whines, ruffs and paw slaps though so I can only guess. I will send you a custom dog picture upon request. Also available upon request, I will do a handwritten letter if you share a little about yourself, if you want a postcard about corn and more corn, I can also provide. Maybe a cow will sneak into the picture and you can get the full view of Nebraska in one go. If I don't reach my goal I will continue to write regardless, the effects on my personal being are great enough that I will pursue it in my spare time regardless. I know you want more than that from me so show me how much you think I should give up my day job. I will take a list of all donors and provide the link upon creation. Give me some content suggestions to create and I'll do it just for you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It's a way to share my secrets to the world, I don't care to keep them any longer. I have always felt that they were to be shared, not locked up forever.

</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Short Summary
I am a guy born in Nebraska. After many years of traveling and some that might be considered difficult, it took 25 years since birth to be comfortable sharing my experiences through life in writings. I have a background in physical labor, technical work with my hands, and even tried a little of the sales life but who wants to be there forever? Writing has been a type of therapy for me already and I hope to provide that same sense, in any measure big or small, to people reading as an indirect goal to writing. I want to provide the world with a much lighter, relateable and more understandable definition of what it means to be weird.

What We Need & What You Get
Any money raised through here will be put towards a website first and foremost, it will provide a way to share works that I want to be available to the public, at least to the community of people that want it. This will include site setup, maintenance costs, etc. I can make that happen with a few hundred dollars. I have to set my dog a limit of no more than $30 for dog treats though so please keep requests meant for him to a minimum, he struggles with his weight sometimes but we are working together to remain active and healthy. His name is Dually. He follows his dream of one day being able to sniff all the dog butts in the world. I think it would mean a lot to him, he only speaks in whines, ruffs and paw slaps though so I can only guess. I will send you a custom dog picture upon request. Also available upon request, I will do a handwritten letter if you share a little about yourself, if you want a postcard about corn and more corn, I can also provide. Maybe a cow will sneak into the picture and you can get the full view of Nebraska in one go. If I don't reach my goal I will continue to write regardless, the effects on my personal being are great enough that I will pursue it in my spare time regardless. I know you want more than that from me so show me how much you think I should give up my day job. I will take a list of all donors and provide the link upon creation. Give me some content suggestions to create and I'll do it just for you.

The Impact
It's a way to share my secrets to the world, I don't care to keep them any longer. I have always felt that they were to be shared, not locked up forever. I have never attempted any project like this but I don't give up on my dreams. Some other hobbies that turned into successes of mine personally would be gardening, climbing, volunteering as an able body to set up events that otherwise wouldn't have the funding and many other things that I don't have space to list on here, but ask and I will always be glad to inform.

Risks & Challenges
There's always a chance that someone steals my work. I want to keep this from happening, by doing things the proper way. That way I can turn it into something sustainable, if I have no legs to stand on then I won't be able to devote more time to the craft, and from what I hear so far, that would be just a darn shame. This is where a website comes into play, it gives me a way to put out my free works without losing them forever to the first person who wishes to put their name on it.

<p><strong>What We Aim To Accomplish With This Book:</strong></p>
<p>Emma is on a mission to help get Pit Bulls out of the animal shelters by education young and old through this beautiful and engaging children's book! She wants to help other people know how wonderful and nice Pit Bulls are and that they are great family dogs even though people have wrong ideas about them. Emma wants to stand up for the Pit Bull breed that has had a bad wrap and can't stand up for themselves by educating society through story, facts, and beautiful pictures! Please help us to get the Pit Bulls out of the animal shelters and into loving homes where they belong by backing out Indiegogo!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>We realize that there can be risks involved when funding someone on Indiegogo. While we understand that people may think there is some chance that this book may not be completed, our track record of creating and publishing our first two books in approximately 3 months should put any concerns to rest. Also, we are currently working on this book in the background and are beyond the framework of the story and are currently having some of the illustrations started (as you can see in the picture for our Indiegogo).</p>
<p>Our biggest concern is that people who win rewards do not supply us with their information and/or pictures quickly so that we can have this project done in the time we expect. We will have cut-off times for people to send us their information that will be added to the book so that we can keep from having procrastinators highjacking our book and ultimately our success in accomplishing our goals!</p>
<p><br/><strong>Other Ways You Can Help!</strong><br/><br/>We understand that not everyone is able to help by backing our campaign financially but we want you to know you can STILL HELP! :) Please share about this Indiegogo campaign in your community, at animal shelters, on social media, and anywhere and to anyone that LOVES Pit Bulls and want them to have loving forever homes! <br/><br/>Please remember to use the Indiegogo share tools to get the word out online to friends, family, companies, and social media influencers that love animals (especially Pit Bulls and rescue/adopted animals)! We appreciate your help in getting the word out and we thank you for anything you can do to support this young authors dream to help animals who can't help themselves!</p>

What We Aim To Accomplish With This Book:
Emma is on a mission to help get Pit Bulls out of the animal shelters by education young and old through this beautiful and engaging children's book! She wants to help other people know how wonderful and nice Pit Bulls are and that they are great family dogs even though people have wrong ideas about them. Emma wants to stand up for the Pit Bull breed that has had a bad wrap and can't stand up for themselves by educating society through story, facts, and beautiful pictures! Please help us to get the Pit Bulls out of the animal shelters and into loving homes where they belong by backing out Indiegogo!
 
Risks and challenges
We realize that there can be risks involved when funding someone on Indiegogo. While we understand that people may think there is some chance that this book may not be completed, our track record of creating and publishing our first two books in approximately 3 months should put any concerns to rest. Also, we are currently working on this book in the background and are beyond the framework of the story and are currently having some of the illustrations started (as you can see in the picture for our Indiegogo).
Our biggest concern is that people who win rewards do not supply us with their information and/or pictures quickly so that we can have this project done in the time we expect. We will have cut-off times for people to send us their information that will be added to the book so that we can keep from having procrastinators highjacking our book and ultimately our success in accomplishing our goals!
Other Ways You Can Help!We understand that not everyone is able to help by backing our campaign financially but we want you to know you can STILL HELP! :) Please share about this Indiegogo campaign in your community, at animal shelters, on social media, and anywhere and to anyone that LOVES Pit Bulls and want them to have loving forever homes! Please remember to use the Indiegogo share tools to get the word out online to friends, family, companies, and social media influencers that love animals (especially Pit Bulls and rescue/adopted animals)! We appreciate your help in getting the word out and we thank you for anything you can do to support this young authors dream to help animals who can't help themselves!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><i>Fierce Winds Rising</i> is a fantasy novel inspired by my favorite fantasy novels, movies, and video games. It is a compilation of all the stories, experiences, and wild imaginings locked up in my head; some are wonderful, most are funny, and a few are disturbing ;).

<p>My favorite fantasy novels include <i>The Dark Elf Trilogy</i> by Salvatore, <i>The Dragonlance Chronicles</i> by Weis and Hickman, and of course, <i>A Song of Ice and Fire </i>series by Martin, which was what really nudged me to write a novel. My favorite fantasy movies are too many to mention, but I'll name a few. I was entranced by <i>Willow </i>when I first saw it in the late '80s. I was too young to see the original <i>Star Wars Trilogy</i> when it first came out, but I remember being obsessed with them during the early '90s when people watched the original cuts on VCR and not the current CGI-enhanced versions. I also watched <i>The Princess Bride</i> over and over again (who didn't?). As for the more recent movies, <i>Pan's Labyrinth</i>, <i>Stardust</i>, and <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i> come to mind.</p>

<p>I started writing<i> Fierce Winds Rising</i> in October, 2012. I have gone through a round of personal editing, and currently, the entire book is around 134,000 words. I expect it to be 135,000+ words when editing is finished.

<p>My excellent editor is currently doing her first round of edits. When she's finished, I'll be editing it one more time, and passing it back to her for the final round.

</p><p><b>Days
of Can’t SELL Your Products and Services Is Over!!!!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Dave tells the story of dozens of “<b>unsold</b>” books that is occupying space
in his sitting room, giving him bad dreams at night and how he overcome
miraculously sold over 500 copies of his book within <b>3 HOURS </b>without any external help.</p>
<p>When writers, authors and info marketers’
laments of can’t SELL their books, special reports, audio programs, DVDs, or
other products and services, I watched them like a hawk. I went through
research after research for years to invent <b>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STRATEGY. </b>It’s eliminates cause of setbacks in
SELLING your ideas, and MUST-sell 100 – over 500 copies of your books/eBooks,
special reports, audio programs, DVDs, and other products and services money
can buy <b>WITHIN 3 HOUR</b> guarantee. </p>
<p>It’s the cheapest <b>WAY</b> to make folks <b>MUST</b>-buy
your ideas and services. Imagine a situation where your folks/prospects buy ideas,
products and services under duress, and <b>REMAINS
</b>happy all the way.</p>
<p>While it cost me just a <b>cent</b> to explore <b>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STRATEGY, </b>within <b>3 HOURS</b>: arrange my bucks $$$, next hour, am on my way to the bank.
I can <b>REACH </b>the same guy any time or
in many cases for <b>FREE </b>Dave hinted!</p>
<p>When the dust raised by <b>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STRATEGY</b> settles
within 3 hours, you will basically know:</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>How much your $2
used to acquire this strategy have generated within 3 <b>HOURS</b>.</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>How many the
folks responded?</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>How much each of
them spent with you. </p>
<p>With this campaign, Dave plan to collect
funds to help innovate <b>CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS STRATEGY; </b>and possibly re-package it in different format to reach
millions struggling to sell their books, eBooks, special reports, audio
programs, video courses, products, and services.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Assurance</b></p>
<p>…opportunity to ascertain the genuineness
of <b>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STRATEGY.</b> </p>
<p>Normally, every project brought to a
public place like <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.indiegogo.com</a> receives her funds in 15
working days, after the expiration of the project. And begin sending the <b>BACKERS</b> (supporters) the rewards “<b>PERKS”</b> after 1 – 3 months or more as
the case maybe.</p>
<p>To establish the authentic nature of <b>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STRATEGY, </b>assuming
the running of the project expires on <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.indiegogo.com</a> by 30<sup>th</sup>, May 2016. We will commence sending rewards “PERKS”
to our supporters/backers on 1<sup>st</sup>, June 2016. To enable our
supporters have the chance to substantiate the genuineness or false claims about <b>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STRATEGY, </b>and quickly
report of any possible scam before the 15 days to receive our benefits elapses.
</p>
<p><b>What
We need &amp; what You Get</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>- We realize our goal is EXTREMELY optimistic, but we
only get one chance at this, so we wanted to go all the way. </span></p>
<p><span>- We have some great perks, including direct access to <b>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STRATEGY </b>step-by
–step set up in eBook, the <b>CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS STRATEGY</b> step-by- step guide in audio programs.</span></p>
<p><span>The <b>CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS STRATEGY</b> step-by- step guide in video courses. </span></p>
<p><span>- We will write a bestselling short eBook of 7,500 words,
and also a FREE mentoring service for supporters/backers.</span></p>
<p><span>- If don’t reach our entire goal, the funds will still
go into the re-packaging of <b>CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS STRATEGY </b>in various format.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Dave hope to spread the awareness about <b>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STRATEGY </b>to reach
every nook and cranny of the world: also eliminates the sufferings of producer,
service creators, idea creators, upcoming authors, writers and info marketers
encounters. There are many already making inroads into the publishing industry
without anything to show for it. <b>CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS STRATEGY </b>has come with a lasting solution to assist beginners FAST
to achieve success as an author, writer, info marketer, and producers of
goods/services.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why
Is That Funding Goal Low?</b></p>

<br/></div>","Days
of Can’t SELL Your Products and Services Is Over!!!!

Dave tells the story of dozens of “unsold” books that is occupying space
in his sitting room, giving him bad dreams at night and how he overcome
miraculously sold over 500 copies of his book within 3 HOURS without any external help.
When writers, authors and info marketers’
laments of can’t SELL their books, special reports, audio programs, DVDs, or
other products and services, I watched them like a hawk. I went through
research after research for years to invent CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STRATEGY. It’s eliminates cause of setbacks in
SELLING your ideas, and MUST-sell 100 – over 500 copies of your books/eBooks,
special reports, audio programs, DVDs, and other products and services money
can buy WITHIN 3 HOUR guarantee. 
It’s the cheapest WAY to make folks MUST-buy
your ideas and services. Imagine a situation where your folks/prospects buy ideas,
products and services under duress, and REMAINS
happy all the way.
While it cost me just a cent to explore CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STRATEGY, within 3 HOURS: arrange my bucks $$$, next hour, am on my way to the bank.
I can REACH the same guy any time or
in many cases for FREE Dave hinted!
When the dust raised by CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STRATEGY settles
within 3 hours, you will basically know:
- 
How much your $2
used to acquire this strategy have generated within 3 HOURS.
- 
How many the
folks responded?
- 
How much each of
them spent with you. 
With this campaign, Dave plan to collect
funds to help innovate CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS STRATEGY; and possibly re-package it in different format to reach
millions struggling to sell their books, eBooks, special reports, audio
programs, video courses, products, and services.
Assurance
…opportunity to ascertain the genuineness
of CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STRATEGY. 
Normally, every project brought to a
public place like www.indiegogo.com receives her funds in 15
working days, after the expiration of the project. And begin sending the BACKERS (supporters) the rewards “PERKS” after 1 – 3 months or more as
the case maybe.
To establish the authentic nature of CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STRATEGY, assuming
the running of the project expires on www.indiegogo.com by 30th, May 2016. We will commence sending rewards “PERKS”
to our supporters/backers on 1st, June 2016. To enable our
supporters have the chance to substantiate the genuineness or false claims about CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STRATEGY, and quickly
report of any possible scam before the 15 days to receive our benefits elapses.

What
We need & what You Get

- We realize our goal is EXTREMELY optimistic, but we
only get one chance at this, so we wanted to go all the way. 
- We have some great perks, including direct access to CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STRATEGY step-by
–step set up in eBook, the CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS STRATEGY step-by- step guide in audio programs.
The CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS STRATEGY step-by- step guide in video courses. 
- We will write a bestselling short eBook of 7,500 words,
and also a FREE mentoring service for supporters/backers.
- If don’t reach our entire goal, the funds will still
go into the re-packaging of CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS STRATEGY in various format.
The
Impact
Dave hope to spread the awareness about CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STRATEGY to reach
every nook and cranny of the world: also eliminates the sufferings of producer,
service creators, idea creators, upcoming authors, writers and info marketers
encounters. There are many already making inroads into the publishing industry
without anything to show for it. CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS STRATEGY has come with a lasting solution to assist beginners FAST
to achieve success as an author, writer, info marketer, and producers of
goods/services.

Why
Is That Funding Goal Low?
If Dave really wants to keep the funding
goal high, many hungry fish will miss out. We have really debated with some
people who need it, they appeal to Dave to keep the funding goal low, if he
really wants to rescue millions out there who may need CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STRATEGY. We should be honest to supporters/backers.

<h3>Adding illustrations</h3>
<p>Hi there! I am the author of Escape from the Crazy Place, a Twine-based Choose-Your-Own-Adventure type story. Escape from the Crazy Place has been in production on and off since it began in manuscript form back in 1984. An interactive round-robin story, it combines the talents of around 20 different authors. Some wrote just a page or two, others wrote dozens. </p>
<p>Although the original EFtCP manuscript was lost in 1985. I rewrote the book from memory and added four sequels, beginning with Return to the Crazy Place. The number of contributors grew also and by the beginning of the 90's I counted at least thirty, including one whose identity remains a mystery. Most of these contributions survive in one form or another, and the book as it exists today is an amalgam of the best parts of all five episodes. The Twine version is the result of an attempt to finally put the project behind me and move on. </p>
<p>I want to add pictures as the story grows so it will reach more people, who I hope will be inspired to contribute or even write their own interactive fiction!</p>

<h3>Help us commission an artist</h3>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My dog, Selena, inspired me to write this book. I adopted Selena from an animal shelter 8 years ago. She's been the <strong>greatest dog I've ever had</strong>. She is loving and loyal. She never leaves my side, but it wasn't always like this. There was a time when Selena would run away often. I adopted Selena because I lost my leg in the<strong> Aurora theater shooting in Colorado. </strong>I was not in a good place but <strong>Selena saved me</strong>. I remember the first week I brought her home I took her for a walk in my wheelchair and she saw a squirrel and she ran away. I didn't know what to do; I sat there for what felt like an hour but then she came back. Another time she ran away was the first time she saw snow.  She kept getting tangled in her leash because she was very excited, so I decided to take her leash off. As soon as her leash was off she ran away. <strong>I just stood there, realizing that was a bad idea.</strong> It was 20 minutes before she found her way back home. The most recent time Selena ran away was while she was in the backyard. She somehow got through the fence and ran away. I couldn't see her anymore in the backyard so I got ready to drive around and find her. When I opened the door, to my surprise, Selena was taking a nap on our welcome mat.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562189143/q2kdwxe99jfv2yhhov9x.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Norman Gileau, 86, said he can remember in vivid detail the moment he first saw the girl who would later become his wife — the same woman he cried over this week as she lay in a hospital bed, temporarily disoriented and non-communicative from a series of what is sometimes known as mini-strokes.</p>
<p>""The first time I laid eyes on this girl she was 10 and I was 10,"" he said from his home of 48 years on Russell Street Friday. ""She was this pretty little blonde girl."" </p>

</div></div>","Just hours remain; need 132 more pre-orders for minimum 

One Square Mile Facebook readers Click here to like our page! have been touched deeply by the online stories about the Jewett City few knew, with many moved to tears. Ultimately, this is not just about the borough. The beautiful diversity of people profiled in this full-color, hard-cover book, and the narrative that threads them together, will inspire you to open your eyes to the fascinating lives in the one square mile of your world, wherever you are.

The World in One Square Mile began in 2015 in honor of Jewett City's 120th anniversary and will feature 120 short profiles of people who live, work or visit the one square mile of the borough. It's not a history book. Many of the interviews are spontaneous and on the street; some are planned. The social media campaign will culminate in this coffee table book. (Thank you to our series-long sponsors: United Community & Family Services; Jewett City Savings Bank.)

A portion of the proceeds will be donated to Griswold Pride and its fight against the heroin crisis. The money will be donated in honor of Kevin Drobiak, a 1998 Griswold High School graduate who lost his own battle with addiction but won in life by touching the hearts of many who knew him. His favorite number was 21. (Editor's note: Originally, goal was a donation of $2,100 based on sales of 2,100 books. That goal remains.) 
  Author Adam Bowles is a 30-year resident of Jewett City who worked for 15 years as a reporter and editor at the Norwich Bulletin, freelanced for such publications at the Connecticut section of The New York Times, and taught journalism at Three Rivers Community College in Norwich for 10 years.  When you pre-order your book today, you will help enhance the reputation of the borough of Jewett City and the town of Griswold by highlighting its people and not just problems. 
When you pre-order your book today, it will serve another purpose — the presentation of a united stand against the heroin crisis that has plagued our towns. Too many people in my life, and I'm sure yours, have been devastated by this epidemic, even in this town.   
Dreams as big as the world transcend our boundaries and its nearly 3,500 residents. People battle fears, depression, loss. People raise their families, seek for love, hope for a better tomorrow. We are one square mile of husbands and wives, dads and moms, sons and daughters. We are one square mile of heartache and healing lived out in homes, banks, baseball fields, skateboard parks, pizza parlors, pharmacies, and backyards. Police battle crime. Firefighters keep watch. Chinese live here. Asian Indians live here. Ecuadorians. Haitians. Italians. Black. White. We are one square mile, but we are America and we are the world.   What We Need & What You Get Buy a book. Enjoy the pre-order-only perks. Boost the borough!  The cost to produce the books dramatically drops after orders of  2,000, etc.  Pre-orders will help pay for professional photography, pre-production, production, distribution and equipment. 
Pre-orders also help continue the social media project on Facebook, which in itself helps promote Jewett City.    Sample Story — Norman Gileau




Norman Gileau, 86, said he can remember in vivid detail the moment he first saw the girl who would later become his wife — the same woman he cried over this week as she lay in a hospital bed, temporarily disoriented and non-communicative from a series of what is sometimes known as mini-strokes.
""The first time I laid eyes on this girl she was 10 and I was 10,"" he said from his home of 48 years on Russell Street Friday. ""She was this pretty little blonde girl."" 
Norma was visiting family across the street from his home in Danielson. Five years later, he saw Norma again while working as an usher at a theater in Danielson. Then, during his senior year at Killingly High School, she moved from New Hampshire into town. Initially, she took a romantic interest in another student, the class president.
""But on graduation night we went in the same car on the way — I remember this like yesterday — to Richard's Dairy in Putnam. From that day on we became a couple,"" he said. They married in 1952. She has lived at Villa Maria Nursing and Rehab Community in Plainfield the last two-and-a-half months.
Norman retired after 31 years as principal of Griswold High School in 1989. He and his wife have seven children and 18 grandchildren. He laughed when he tried to recall the exact number of great-grandchildren — 8, he said. 
""My family is the best thing that ever happened to me,"" he said.
In September 2013, his grandson, Trevor Marttila, died at age 20 in a motorcycle accident soon after getting engaged. Trevor, a former Marine, never stopped showing public affection for his grandfather even as an adult. ""He'd give me a hug and peck on the cheek,"" Norman said, choking up with emotion. ""He didn't care who was around or who was watching. He was going to do this.
""That kid was so special. You shouldn't say you have a favorite grandson, but to be honest with yourself you do. Even though I love them all."" 
Norman described his biggest concern these days.
""It's not about World War III or anything like that,"" he said. ""It's about what is going to happen to all these young people who are involved in chemicals, in heroin. How are they going to achieve happiness?
""Nobody is immune to this,"" he said, acknowledging that a relative has battled an addiction. 
And then there's his piece of advice for today's generation.
""For kids to honor their parents would be one of the best things they can do,"" Norman said, although he said many children suffer from absentee parents. ""It's one of the commandments, brought down by Moses.""

<p><strong>Die Geschichte die wir uns ausgedacht haben:</strong><br/>Das Jahr 2150 ist geprägt von mächtigen, skrupellosen Soldaten und Angehörigen des Regimes. Während sich die Neu-Alliierten auf dem Kontinent Amerika in Sicherheit wiegen, kämpft in weiten Teilen von Europa die Fraktion der Antitechniker in alten Untergrundbasen und Bunkern gegen das Regime. Die Antitechniker waren einst die Hüter des technologischen Fortschrittes, nun müssen sie verzweifelt gegen ein Regime kämpfen welche ihre Technologien übernommen haben. Das Regime überwacht alles und jeden. Es gibt keine Privatsphäre mehr. </p>
<p>Als im Jahre 2150 durch ein ""galaktisches"" Ereignis, ausgelöst durch eine fremde Macht, die sogenannten Reptoiden der Cluster (das bekannte Universum) in Erschütterung geraten, werden Joe und Vivianne Dexter aus ihrem Leben im Jahre 2016 in die Zukunft geschleudert.</p>
<p>Joe und Vivianne stranden in einer Zukunft, welches alles Bekannte in den Schatten stellt. Sie schliessen sich dem Widerstand an und kämpfen gegen das Regime. Die Zeit-reisenden müssen unweigerlich feststellen, dass die Menschheit nichts aus Ihren Fehlern gelernt hat.</p>
<p>Das Regime ist so mächtig, dass eine Aussicht auf Erfolg kaum denkbar ist. In den Untergrundbasen entwickelt der Widerstand Waffen, neue Strategien und entdecken ein uraltes Wissen wieder. Der Kampf beginnt. Doch was die Rebellen nicht wissen, ist der Umstand, dass die Neu-Germanier nur Lakaien einer Spezies sind, die bereits seit Jahrtausenden Krieg gegen das Licht führt. Die Erde ist das Zentrum eines uralten Krieges. Einige Menschen besitzen eine Essenz und wissen nichts davon, da diese sich erst noch offenbaren. Wenn die Offenbarung gewinnt dann wird sich das Weltgeschehen ändern.  </p>
<p><strong>In unserem Artbook der Zukunft beleben wir die Welt rund um die in den Romanen ""Gefangene der Zukunft"" beschriebenen Handlungen.</strong> Wir hauchen dem neuen Science-Fiction Universum mehr Leben ein und bringen die Technologien, Gebäude, Fraktionen und Alltagsgegenstände auf Papier. Wir stellen die Welt der Zukunft in einem Buch dar.<br/><br/>Ich bin <strong>Steve Schild</strong> und Autor von <a href=""http://www.gefangenederzukunft.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Gefangene der Zukunft</strong></a>. Zusammen mit<a href=""http://www.leo-kopka.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> <strong>Leo Kopka</strong></a>, Grafiker und Designer bringen wir die Welt der Zukunft in ein schönes Hardcover Buch.

</div><div>Unser grösstes Risiko ist das euch unser Buch nicht gefällt. Wir arbeiten hart und investieren viel Zeit in das Buch, wir haben Feedbacks von euch geholt, mit Leuten gesprochen und sind auf viele Wünsche und Anregungen von euch eingegangen. Man kennt uns nicht und wir sind zwei unbekannte Personen. Hast Du Fragen? Dann kontaktiere uns unter <u>steve.schild@bluewin.ch</u><br/>Unser Risiko besteht darin, dass wir sehr viel Zeit und Geld in ein Produkt investieren, dass es so noch nicht gibt. Gefangene der Zukunft ist ein Science-Fiction Universum das noch völlig unbekannt ist.<br/><br/>Genau wie Du, haben wir uns die Frage gestellt, sollen wir das Projekt starten? <br/><strong>Wir haben uns für ein JA entschieden. Wir sind überzeugt, dass unser Buch euch anregt Geanken über die Zukunft zu machen. </strong>
</div><div> </div><div>
<strong>Wir sind fast am Schluss, hier noch einmal kurz zusammengefasst die wichtigsten Fragen:</strong><br/> </div><div>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Warum wollen wir das Projekt machen? Warum ist unser Vorhaben so wichtig?</strong><br/>Wir wollen euch in die Zukunft entführen und euch aufzeigen, wie wir in der Zukunft leben könnten. Wie wir uns die Zukunft vorstellen und warum es wichtig ist, aus der Vergangenheit zu lernen. Abschliessend sollten wir uns vermehrt Gedanken über die Zukunft machen und nicht einfach nur im hier und jetzt leben, denn alles was wir heute entscheiden hat Einfluss auf unsere <strong>Kinder und deren Zukunft.</strong> Seit ich Vater bin ist das auch für mich <br/>noch viel wichtiger. Das Projekt soll also auch zum Nachdenken anregen. <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Was wollen wir machen? Was passiert alles im Rahmen des Projekts?</strong><br/>Wir erstellen ein Artbook und versuchen die Frage zu beantworten, wie werden wir im Jahre 2150 leben? Wir erstellen Bilder, Texte und Visionen. Wir machen Werbung, Plakate, schalten Banner und Facebook Anzeigen. <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Wie setzen wir die Projektidee um?</strong><br/>Wir sind ein Visionär und ein Grafikdesigner, wir nutzen die aktuellen Technologien um euch ein Artbook der Zukunft zu gestalten. Wir veröffentlichen ein Buch.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Welche Konsequenzen ergeben sich daraus, wenn das Projekt stattfindet bzw. nicht stattfindet</strong>?<br/>Das Projekt wird in jedem Fall gestartet und das Buch auf den Mark erscheinen. Falls wir das Projekt aus einem unbekanntem Grund abbrechen müssen, erhaltet ihr euer Geld zurück. </li>

Die Geschichte die wir uns ausgedacht haben:Das Jahr 2150 ist geprägt von mächtigen, skrupellosen Soldaten und Angehörigen des Regimes. Während sich die Neu-Alliierten auf dem Kontinent Amerika in Sicherheit wiegen, kämpft in weiten Teilen von Europa die Fraktion der Antitechniker in alten Untergrundbasen und Bunkern gegen das Regime. Die Antitechniker waren einst die Hüter des technologischen Fortschrittes, nun müssen sie verzweifelt gegen ein Regime kämpfen welche ihre Technologien übernommen haben. Das Regime überwacht alles und jeden. Es gibt keine Privatsphäre mehr. 
Als im Jahre 2150 durch ein ""galaktisches"" Ereignis, ausgelöst durch eine fremde Macht, die sogenannten Reptoiden der Cluster (das bekannte Universum) in Erschütterung geraten, werden Joe und Vivianne Dexter aus ihrem Leben im Jahre 2016 in die Zukunft geschleudert.
Joe und Vivianne stranden in einer Zukunft, welches alles Bekannte in den Schatten stellt. Sie schliessen sich dem Widerstand an und kämpfen gegen das Regime. Die Zeit-reisenden müssen unweigerlich feststellen, dass die Menschheit nichts aus Ihren Fehlern gelernt hat.
Das Regime ist so mächtig, dass eine Aussicht auf Erfolg kaum denkbar ist. In den Untergrundbasen entwickelt der Widerstand Waffen, neue Strategien und entdecken ein uraltes Wissen wieder. Der Kampf beginnt. Doch was die Rebellen nicht wissen, ist der Umstand, dass die Neu-Germanier nur Lakaien einer Spezies sind, die bereits seit Jahrtausenden Krieg gegen das Licht führt. Die Erde ist das Zentrum eines uralten Krieges. Einige Menschen besitzen eine Essenz und wissen nichts davon, da diese sich erst noch offenbaren. Wenn die Offenbarung gewinnt dann wird sich das Weltgeschehen ändern.  
In unserem Artbook der Zukunft beleben wir die Welt rund um die in den Romanen ""Gefangene der Zukunft"" beschriebenen Handlungen. Wir hauchen dem neuen Science-Fiction Universum mehr Leben ein und bringen die Technologien, Gebäude, Fraktionen und Alltagsgegenstände auf Papier. Wir stellen die Welt der Zukunft in einem Buch dar.Ich bin Steve Schild und Autor von Gefangene der Zukunft. Zusammen mit Leo Kopka, Grafiker und Designer bringen wir die Welt der Zukunft in ein schönes Hardcover Buch. Lassen Sie sich von tollen Bildern inspirieren und tauchen Sie mit uns in die Welt der Zukunft ein.

Wir zeigen Ideen und Konzepte von Fluggeräten, Fahrzeugen und Alltagsgegenständen. Wir erklären warum es im Jahre 2150 immer noch Cola gibt und Schokolade immer noch ein Teil der Ernährung bildet. Wir haben im Artbook QR-Codes versteckt. Mit diesen Codes gelangst Du zu interaktiven Medien die online aufrufen werden kann. Was das sein wird, halten wir geheim. Finde es heraus.
Auf vielen farbigen Seiten im Format 14.8x21cm als Hardcover bieten wir schöne hochauflösenden Grafiken, Konzepte und Bilder und lassen  in eine Welt der optischen Sinnesreizen eintauchen.

Unser grösstes Risiko ist das euch unser Buch nicht gefällt.

Man kennt uns nicht und wir sind zwei unbekannte Personen. Hast Du Fragen? Dann kontaktiere uns unter steve.schild@bluewin.chUnser Risiko besteht darin, dass wir sehr viel Zeit und Geld in ein Produkt investieren, dass es so noch nicht gibt. Gefangene der Zukunft ist ein Science-Fiction Universum das noch völlig unbekannt ist.Genau wie Du, haben wir uns die Frage gestellt, sollen wir das Projekt starten? Wir haben uns für ein JA entschieden.

Wir sind fast am Schluss, hier noch einmal kurz zusammengefasst die wichtigsten Fragen: 


Warum wollen wir das Projekt machen? Warum ist unser Vorhaben so wichtig?Wir wollen euch in die Zukunft entführen und euch aufzeigen, wie wir in der Zukunft leben könnten. Wie wir uns die Zukunft vorstellen und warum es wichtig ist, aus der Vergangenheit zu lernen. Abschliessend sollten wir uns vermehrt Gedanken über die Zukunft machen und nicht einfach nur im hier und jetzt leben, denn alles was wir heute entscheiden hat Einfluss auf unsere Kinder und deren Zukunft. Seit ich Vater bin ist das auch für mich noch viel wichtiger. Das Projekt soll also auch zum Nachdenken anregen.  

Was wollen wir machen? Was passiert alles im Rahmen des Projekts?Wir erstellen ein Artbook und versuchen die Frage zu beantworten, wie werden wir im Jahre 2150 leben? Wir erstellen Bilder, Texte und Visionen. Wir machen Werbung, Plakate, schalten Banner und Facebook Anzeigen.  

Wie setzen wir die Projektidee um?Wir sind ein Visionär und ein Grafikdesigner, wir nutzen die aktuellen Technologien um euch ein Artbook der Zukunft zu gestalten. Wir veröffentlichen ein Buch. 

Welche Konsequenzen ergeben sich daraus, wenn das Projekt stattfindet bzw. nicht stattfindet?Das Projekt wird in jedem Fall gestartet und das Buch auf den Mark erscheinen. Falls wir das Projekt aus einem unbekanntem Grund abbrechen müssen, erhaltet ihr euer Geld zurück.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Dudás Gergely vagyok, újságíró. Még az internetrobbanás előtt kezdtem, aztán 2004-től <strong>13 éven át az Indexnél dolgoztam</strong>. Voltam gazdasági rovatvezető, főszerkesztő-helyettes, aztán <strong>2013 elejétől idén nyárig, több mint négy éven át főszerkesztő</strong>. Egy sok ember távozását követő válsághelyzetben újraépítettem a szerkesztőséget, és sok kiváló kollegámmal szerintem a lehető legjobb újságot csináltuk meg az ingyenes tartalomra épített üzleti modell buktatói mellett.</p>
<p>Az Indexnél a pár hónappal ezelőtt bejelentett tulajdonosváltás után felmondtam. Azért is döntöttem így, mert úgy éreztem, hogy<strong> a mai magyar média képtelen betölteni alapvető feladatát: </strong>nem tud a közéleti hírekről több aspektusból, kellő mélységben és alapossággal beszámolni. Ez a hiányosság pedig túlmutat önmagán, az egyik oka közbeszédünk durvulásának, felületessé válásának, annak, hogy Magyarországon eltűnt a párbeszéd lehetősége.</p>
<p>Hiszem, hogy <strong>a demokrácia egyik alapja a jól működő nyilvánosság</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>De az etikus, független és minőségi újságírásnak nemcsak a politikai, hanem a gazdasági függetlenség is fontos feltétele. </strong>A legtisztább alapot az előfizetéses megoldás jelenti: ha az újság fő bevételi forrása az olvasóktól érkezik, csak nekik kell megfelelnie, ez a minőség valódi záloga.</p>
<p>Az induláshoz azonban tőke kell. Ha azt akarjuk, hogy legyen valóban minőségi, tisztán közéleti online újság, aminek a függetlensége és a befolyásolhatatlansága biztosított, <strong>előre kell összeadni az előfizetési díjakat.</strong></p>
<p>300 millió forint rengeteg pénz, ennyit szeretnék összegyűjteni, de az üzleti terv kisebb mennyiségű hirdetési bevétellel is számol. Ezzel a tőkével el lehet indítani <strong>egy több mint 30 fős, a legjobb magyar újságírókból álló szerkesztőséget.</strong> <strong>Ennyi embert közéleti vonalon a legnagyobb magyar szerkesztőségek sem tudnak felmutatni, </strong>de ennél kisebb erejüket is elaprózzák. A minőség egyik garanciája a Politis esetében a csapat létszáma és összetétele, és az, hogy a szenior stábnak kizárólag magas hozzáadott értékű anyagokat kell készítenie.</p>
<p><strong>Tízezer forint az éves előfizetés </strong>– azoknak, akik most döntenek, ez közel 60 százalékos kedvezmény a tervezett havi díjhoz képest. Nem kis pénz ez sem. De ez a történet arról is szól, <strong>megteremtünk-e Magyarországon a rosszul működő médiapiacon egy valódi közéleti újságot.</strong></p>
<p>Az előfizetőktől ezért megelőlegezett bizalomra van szükség.</p>
<p>De ez azt is jelenti, hogy <strong>annak az árát kell megfizetni, hogy az újság mögött nincs oligarcha,</strong> <strong>megkérdőjelezhető tisztességű vagy szándékú vállalkozó</strong>, aki letenné az induláshoz szükséges tőkét. Ez a lap tisztán és csak akkor indul, ha van elég ember, akinek hiányzik egy minőségi közéleti online portál.</p>
<p>Ha nem jön össze elég ember, <strong>mindenki visszakapja a pénzét az Indiegogótól</strong>: a kampány csak abban az esetben sikeres, ha eléri a kitűzött célt. Ha nem lesz jó az újság, ha az előfizető elégedetlen, akkor valóban veszített, de vele együtt bukik az újság is. Éppen attól tiszta a helyzet, hogy <strong>ez lenne Magyarországon hosszú ideje az első szerkesztőség, aminek valóban csak az olvasók elvárásainak kell megfelelnie.</strong></p>
<p>A körülmények nehezek: a közösségi finanszírozást legtipikusabban kütyükre kérik, amikről egy gyönyörű videó megtekintése után a néző úgy érzi, azonnal kell neki egy olyan. A Politis nincs kész. <strong>A Politis csapata sincs még együtt, leendő tagjai ma különböző szerkesztőségekben vagy másutt dolgoznak, és nem vállalhatják a felmondás kockázatát egy több hónapos kampányra</strong>, szerződéseik érthetően tiltják, hogy konkurens termékek mögé sorakozzanak fel.</p>
<p>Én azt gondolom, hogy van, lennie kell Magyarországon bőven több mint 30 ezer olyan embernek, aki elégedetlen a média, a nyilvánosság állapotával, és hajlandó is elfogadni, hogy ha változást és minőségi sajtót akar, fizetnie kell. Segíts abban, hogy biztosan elegen legyünk: miután előfizettél, oszd meg az előfizetésed tényét a Facebookon, kövesd a kampányt, és segíts, hogy minél többekhez eljusson.</p>

<br/>          To the Indiegogo Campaign for ""Lou and the Fuel Cell Lincoln"" The Book. <br/><br/>Hi, I'm Lou and together with your help we can create a fun
educational children's STEM book about Fuel Cells. <br/>Science / Technology / Engineering / Mathematics<br/>~ Today most books on Fuel Cells and the electro-chemical processes involved are quite complex. <br/>
</div>I figured this presented a need for a creative educational and entertaining book on the Clean Energy of Fuel Cells and Fuel Cell Vehicles for kids their parents and early adopters too.......So I wrote one.<br/><br/>The book explores the history and technology of Hydrogen Fuel Cells, there current use in
powering a wide range of equipment, buildings, power plants and the vehicles many of today's students will
be driving.....once they get their drivers license that is!<br/><br/><br/>The  story follows a young Lou on a Journey to a Fuel Cell factory for (*<i>updated</i>)     <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hydrogen_and_Fuel_Cell_Day"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day </a>   to learn how Fuel Cells work, cleanly powering vehicles, buildings and equipment, reducing the demand of fossil fuel dependence and then putting that knowledge to work converting his Uncle Arthur's, <br/>""Maximum Emission"" Hot Rod Lincoln into The ""Zero Emission"" Fuel Cell Lincoln!
<br/><br/>The written story (~60pgs.) is complete and my rough draft pictures will form the basis for the books Illustrations.

<br/><br/>My Story</div></div></u></h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My desire to take actions that offer solutions for a cleaner environment, a love of Classic old school cars and knowledge of Hydrogen Fuel Cells and Electric Vehicles has been
the  significant inspiration of this entertaining and educational book that has been nearly two years in the making. 
</p>
<p>In the process of putting my study and passion for Fuel Cell Vehicles ( FCV's ) to work, I endeavored as an educational project to build my own Fuel Cell vehicle conversion, a work in
progress.</p>
<p>Good fortune came my way in the form of a  Classic Lincoln Continental Mark V, an extravagant
symbol of the power consuming (10 mpg), pollution emitting 70's. <br/></p>
<p>Purchased
from a distinguished family in Seattle, whose name is synonymous with
big engine tugboats, makes this Lincoln an all the more perfect
retrofit candidate. <br/></p>This is just a great story that shares the enthusiasm, new technologies and momentum of the clean energy movement, that will additionally facilitate my project. <br/><br/>From my past experience as a children's ski &amp; snowboard instructor, I know kids want to learn this kind of stuff.<br/><p><br/></p>
<div style=""font-size: 20px; text-align: center;""> With Your help we can get ""Lou and The Fuel Cell Lincoln"" Illustrated and to Print!<br/>

<br/><div align=""center""><b>Funding Goal : $8,500  </b></div>
<p></p>
<p>My first step will be to hire an Illustrator for the approximately
~60 depictions,                            estimated costs $2750.</p>
<p>We have an ""amazingly skilled"" animator in mind, you can view some of their work   <a href=""http://www.sleepyotter.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here @ Sleepy Otter</a>. <br/></p>
<p>Second will be the production formatting,                     
                                                              
approximate costs $1000.</p>
<p>The third step will be to acquire ISBN # numbers,copyright and bar-codes,   
                                                      costs about
$750.</p>
<p>An estimate of approximately $1250 for Indiegogo , transaction and delivery
fees.

<p></p></div>","Welcome!
          To the Indiegogo Campaign for ""Lou and the Fuel Cell Lincoln"" The Book. Hi, I'm Lou and together with your help we can create a fun
educational children's STEM book about Fuel Cells. Science / Technology / Engineering / Mathematics~ Today most books on Fuel Cells and the electro-chemical processes involved are quite complex. 
I figured this presented a need for a creative educational and entertaining book on the Clean Energy of Fuel Cells and Fuel Cell Vehicles for kids their parents and early adopters too.......So I wrote one.The book explores the history and technology of Hydrogen Fuel Cells, there current use in
powering a wide range of equipment, buildings, power plants and the vehicles many of today's students will
be driving.....once they get their drivers license that is!The  story follows a young Lou on a Journey to a Fuel Cell factory for (*updated)     National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day    to learn how Fuel Cells work, cleanly powering vehicles, buildings and equipment, reducing the demand of fossil fuel dependence and then putting that knowledge to work converting his Uncle Arthur's, ""Maximum Emission"" Hot Rod Lincoln into The ""Zero Emission"" Fuel Cell Lincoln!
The written story (~60pgs.) is complete and my rough draft pictures will form the basis for the books Illustrations.


~Now I need an Illustrator and to bring this book to print.~Together with your help, We can Power""Lou and The Fuel Cell Lincoln"" !

This story is one of the ways  you can support early adoption of a clean zero emission technology that can get us "" Under 2 "" .

Fuel Cell & Hydrogen CommunitySponsorship


If your not on the Hydrogen Highway, it's a long road to a Clean Energy Society!

I would like to urge the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen community, together with other Clean Energy Organizations & early adopters to show their support, it's absolutely essential to the success of this effort. 

Go /No go:

Reaching the required ""Fixed Funding Campaign Goal"" Is the  ""GO""  I Need.
I have elected to make this a Fixed Funding Campaign, to inspire confidence that my ability to complete the project is not restricted by finances                                   I will only receive funds if the goal it met.It assures the necessary resources to produce ""Lou and the Fuel Cell Lincoln"" as a  Quality product with a timely Earth Day delivery .Not reaching the required goal?....just like a Charlie in the box from the Isle of misfit toys ....Lou and his story of Clean Energy and The Fuel Cell Lincoln will be sent to the Isle of Uncirculated Books and  All contributions will be returned!
My Story

My desire to take actions that offer solutions for a cleaner environment, a love of Classic old school cars and knowledge of Hydrogen Fuel Cells and Electric Vehicles has been
the  significant inspiration of this entertaining and educational book that has been nearly two years in the making. 

In the process of putting my study and passion for Fuel Cell Vehicles ( FCV's ) to work, I endeavored as an educational project to build my own Fuel Cell vehicle conversion, a work in
progress.
Good fortune came my way in the form of a  Classic Lincoln Continental Mark V, an extravagant
symbol of the power consuming (10 mpg), pollution emitting 70's. 
Purchased
from a distinguished family in Seattle, whose name is synonymous with
big engine tugboats, makes this Lincoln an all the more perfect
retrofit candidate. This is just a great story that shares the enthusiasm, new technologies and momentum of the clean energy movement, that will additionally facilitate my project. From my past experience as a children's ski & snowboard instructor, I know kids want to learn this kind of stuff.
 With Your help we can get ""Lou and The Fuel Cell Lincoln"" Illustrated and to Print!
 

What We Need
Funding Goal : $8,500  

My first step will be to hire an Illustrator for the approximately
~60 depictions,                            estimated costs $2750.
We have an ""amazingly skilled"" animator in mind, you can view some of their work   Here @ Sleepy Otter. 
Second will be the production formatting,                     
                                                              
approximate costs $1000.
The third step will be to acquire ISBN # numbers,copyright and bar-codes,   
                                                      costs about
$750.
An estimate of approximately $1250 for Indiegogo , transaction and delivery
fees. 

Lastly will be to print a limited run of Lou and the Fuel Cell
Lincoln for circulation and delivery as perks, about  $2750.
Our book printer of choice is family owned Gorham Printing in Centralia, Washington.
Delivery : Earth Day 2016


Stretch Goal: Additional $6,000

1 copy (535) sent to every member of Congress Earth Day 2016!

<p>Since I found out my wife was pregnant (back in 2013) I wanted to make sure I completed some sort of project so my child would see something that I created, something that would be tangible for his or her hands. That is what this poetry collection is, a completion of a time where I was writing poetry. It could have been in the back of college notebooks and staying up late chatting online and listening to music to somehow gain a muse for my writings. I went through all of my writings at that time and created something of that time frame for you to read.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I am not an Artist” is the mindset I was in, the loneliness, the heart ache, the wishful thinking and of hope. The backdrop is of post 9/11 and a college career ending in Buffalo New York.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You would be helping out to create something. It would be official, I would be able to get an ISBN number and officially sell the collection at stores and Amazon. Also would be able to put it in Nook and Kindle for electronic reading.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I would be able to pay for the website and be able to officially self-publish the collection and move forward with a couple other projects that are almost completed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It would also help to show both my son and daughter that anything is possible when you put your mind to create something.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What you will be getting:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$1 Thank You, an Electronic Thank You</p>
<p>$5 A Thank you Note sent to you in the mail</p>
<p>$20 I am not an Artist T-Shirt</p>
<p>$25 I am not an Artist T-Shirt plus one random poem from the book.</p>
<p>$30 I am not an Artist Paperback</p>
<p>$40 I am not an Artist Signed Paperback</p>
<p>$50 I am not an Artist Signed Paperback with T-Shirt</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There will be a stretch goal of $1,500 for when it is reached everyone who bought the Collection will be upgraded to a Hardcover copy of the book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we reach $2,000 stretch goal everyone who bought the Signed Copy will get an exclusive artwork for the next project I am working on, A children’s book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you so very much for supporting my dream. This is not possible without the help of friends and family members that encouraged my writings and art work.</p>

I am also hoping you will want to be part of this special story.What I Do I am an Artist. I write,  I draw,I teach   I tell stories,    and when I am not doing those things, I create in many other ways.It's what I love to do.Now, although I have been involved in art in many different forms throughout the years, I have the most fun and am happiest when I am writing and illustrating children’s books. I am also taking the knowledge I have gained, and the connections I have established, and I am making them available to other aspiring Authors under the StoryTime Books umbrella. What I have accomplished so farI currently have two children’s story books self published and available through Amazon, Storytimebooks.ca, as well as other retail outlets and public libraries. There is a lot more.I have fifteen (and counting) additional children’s books in various stages of completion. I also have so many more that are yet to be started!I am also using StoryTime Books to bring people together and support anyone who wants to publish one of their own stories.I am happy to say there are now two additional Authors that will be published under the StoryTime Books umbrella. I also intend to have my third book, Arthur The Sleepy Dog, published before the end of 2018.That's where we are right now and this is where you come into the story!What I am asking forI need your help in making this a successful story. I want you to help in spreading happiness. I truly mean that. That's really what this is all about. I guarantee, I absolutely promise, that everyone who is involved, from Campaign Participants like you, at any level, all the way around to those enjoying the stories at bed time, I know, everyone will be happier because of what we do here! I want to make a lot of people happier! A good story makes you happy. Why, just the thought of one will bring a smile, and I bet if you just thought of one, you are smiling right now. Then there is also that very special feeling you will have when you know you were part of creating all of the happiness. It is really what makes it all worth while.What I need Be warned, this is the dry business end of the story and although fact filled, it's not very adventurous. $20,000.00 Initial ParticipationHere's why: Printing ServicesCurrently my books are produced on a print per order basis through an arm of Amazon which requires no initial outlay for stock, however the profit margins are minimal and do not provide for any of the additional administrative expenses incurred by this undertaking. In order to get a competitive price on printing, it is necessary to order in volume.  This requires a substantial initial outlay, however net profit increases by a significant amount. Buying stock in volume is what gets the proverbial ball rolling. Editorial ServicesThe last thing I want is to put out a children's book with spelling and grammar errors. I can catch most of these however a trained professional eye is well worth the expense. Layout ServicesAlthough I do all of my own illustration and also provide the same service to everyone under the StoryTime umbrella, I am not a graphic specialist, and I do not have the equipment necessary to produce crisp full colour professional digital imagery. I have made connections in this field that have resulted in fantastic results (just look at my books) at a very discounted cost, however there is still a cost.  Advertising ServicesThis is as important as any of the other factors. You can have the best product in the world, but if nobody knows about it, it won't be successful.

<p>As artists, we have come to know the strong power of positive thinking, and finally we want to share this knowledge with the world. So we married the most effective parts of our personal agendas to our vision boards to help you channel the positive, focus on your goals, and realize all your dreams. The best part is your positive action ripples outward for a portion of the proceeds of each agenda purchased go to charities making a difference both locally and worldwide. With <i>My Infinite Agenda</i>, when you seek to champion your own life, you are also lifting up others, thus creating an infinite ripple effect of positivity.</p>
<p>We believe that what you ask for, focus on, and work toward, you will receive. So here’s our challenge for you today: If you could ask the universe for anything, small or big, what would it be? What if you had nothing to lose? There are infinite possibilities out there waiting to be invested in, explored, and realized.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to start this journey with you! The first step is to imagine the life you want... and then build it. Start writing your destiny today!</p>

Meet Founders, Raquel & Katie!
Meet Founders of My Infinite Agenda-- Katie Copland and Raquel Suarez Groen. My Infinite Agenda was born after a decade of friendship, with the purpose of making a difference in people’s lives…
Ten years ago we followed our hearts to New York City to pursue graduate education and careers in opera. Little did we know that fate would lead us to meet, become best friends, and realize our highest ambitions. 
We both had the mindset that anything was possible. Our secret weapon began with our belief in the power of positive thinking. We had always loved inspirational quotes, and discovered that for years we had both created annual vision boards. 
Fast-forward 10 years, we were both in the midst of performing careers, and feeling a call to have a greater impact on the world. Over a balmy NYC summer evening, the idea for My Infinite Agenda, our ‘product with a purpose’ was born. We set out to create a tangible offering—something that would emanate goodwill infinitely outward, and ultimately resonate long after any note we had sung had evaporated in to the air. It became clear our mission was to spread positivity, and to give people hope where it may have gotten lost.
Today Raquel can be seen on Broadway as Carlotta Giudicelli in Phantom of the Opera, and Katie is a professional singer on the voice faculty at Fordham University.
As artists, we have come to know the strong power of positive thinking, and finally we want to share this knowledge with the world. So we married the most effective parts of our personal agendas to our vision boards to help you channel the positive, focus on your goals, and realize all your dreams. The best part is your positive action ripples outward for a portion of the proceeds of each agenda purchased go to charities making a difference both locally and worldwide. With My Infinite Agenda, when you seek to champion your own life, you are also lifting up others, thus creating an infinite ripple effect of positivity.
We believe that what you ask for, focus on, and work toward, you will receive. So here’s our challenge for you today: If you could ask the universe for anything, small or big, what would it be? What if you had nothing to lose? There are infinite possibilities out there waiting to be invested in, explored, and realized.

'Why We Are Coming' is going to be my third book. I began work on this book in the winter of 2017, having arrived in the US and applied for asylum only a few months after the election that sent Donald Trump to the White House. The electorate – enough of it at least – had bought into his monochrome narrative of blunt jingoism and simple solutions and lifted him to office. His was a pantomime politics with a cast of American heroes and migrant villains; that framed any newcomer to the States as at worst a dangerous criminal and at best a societal parasite feeding on tax-funded public assistance programs. True to at least part of its word the Administration ratcheted up already rigorous and restrictive policies towards migrants. My timing could have not been less auspicious.</p><p> </p><p>The US was not my first destination. For more than a decade I worked in the Middle East as a migrant journalist and my exit from both the countries to which I had migrated, was ugly1. Furthermore, I tried my best to stay in my homeland Uganda but the economic, social and political conditions made life as I envisaged it, impossible. The concept of economic inequality does not characterize adequately the circumstances in Uganda, where everyone struggles to earn a sustainable income and the country’s most valuable resources have been stripped by foreign interests.</p><p><br/>I offer the concerned reader an explanation for the migrant crisis, one that is delivered in the first person singular because I have lived it. I am not a freeloader. Indeed I am just like you but come from a world that you can't imagine. I am going to help you to see and understand that world in order that you can empathize with those who leave it in order to come to your. I answer the question: why we are coming? First, I frame this as a moral question in an historical context. Migration is driven by the human desire to escape poverty, corruption and tyranny in the undeveloped and underdeveloped world. These circumstances are the legacy of the West's interaction with that world: colonialism, slavery, neo-colonialism, dictatorship by proxy, and corporate adventurism. That legacy is deeply enmeshed not only with the society of my homeland but also with that of nearly every country in Africa. So, this story elucidates a complex picture and traces a long, historical arc to explain why migrants flee their homelands rather than staying to resist, in the hopes of achieving true political and economic reform.</p><p> </p><p>Into the fabric of my historical material is woven a moral thread. The single most important unifying strand of every major moral philosophical ideal in human civilization is the recognition that every human is of equal moral value. Many parts migrants see their homeland inundated with long-term seemingly insoluble problems. They see the West as a lifeboat transporting individuals to a harbor that opens up to a landscape of progress and development. Migrants will take on any risk to get aboard the lifeboat because the only alternative is to drown. The only sensible question is why are the people in treacherous water not as important as the people in the boat.</p><p> </p><p>That moral question is central to both the issue and the experience of migration but, putting it aside, we can see both in purely material – economic and political – terms. The US in particular benefits enormously from the huge inflow of migrants – both documented and undocumented – who provide cheap labor in virtually every sector of the economy, and particularly in those in which Americans would prefer not to work: the 3Ds of dirty, dangerous and demeaning. However, few Americans understand still less acknowledge that significance. Migrants work in agriculture and hospitality but we will focus here on a sector that is as important as it is neglected: caregiving. As the American population continues to age, the demand for caregivers - mostly immigrants - will continue to rise.</p><p> </p><p>Despite the inflammatory rhetoric of both the Nativist politicians, there are many Americans who do not see migrants as dangerous intruders. Likewise, the American media have investigated and reported stories that contradict and challenge the political rhetoric. As Americans prepare for the next presidential election, they understand that some politicians have projected disparaging portrayals of migrants to foment anger, resentment and fear that have led voters to cast ballots without stopping to think about the multidimensional moral, economic and political consequences of their decision.</p><p> </p><p>The book’s overall objective is simple.

<h3>Welcome to The Shoosh Report</h3>
<p>The Shoosh Report that sprung from the mind of Twitter's very own Liberty Impostor. After gaining some notoriety within the libertarian world, the Impostor realized his time on Twitter would be cut short. Due to Twitter, Facebook, etc... banning anything right of the Authoritarian Left, Liberty Impostor decided to create a site to do what he does best.</p>
<p>Satire.</p>
<p>Welcome to The Shoosh Report, a place for hilarious articles, fake news, and real think pieces. The Shoosh Report is basically what happens when comedians become the world's leading intellectuals.  While it's likely that this publication will be known for it's satire, it will be done with the purpose of creating a thinktank that isn't beholden to special interests. So think, one part satire, one part non-Koch-funded thinktank.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>This project is going to be completely crowd-funded. The goal is to eventually monetize, and pay our writers, but in the meantime this website will be funded entirely by subscribers. So we figure, let's get our subscribers started right now! Many people on Twitter have come to love the Impostor account, and are likely sick of having to follow him every couple of weeks. So, we're going to give you a place that won't get deplatformed for infuriating everyone's favorite gun-grabbing republican. So, here's what we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Website costs.</li>
<li>Developer costs.</li>
<li>Incentive for writers.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Purpose</h3>
<p>While this project seems fun and goofy, the goal is to eventually dethrone the publications that are being funded by billionaires that don't care about you. We look at people like Joe Rogan, Dave Smith, Jimmy Kimmel, and all of the other comedians that are teaching people how to think, and start to realize that there exists a trend of comedians being our new thought leaders. This publication will draw people in with the most effective marketing strategy: humor. </p>
<p>Over time, The Shoosh Report will also become known for having good ideas presented through the lens of comedy. We hope that this winning strategy will play out with the support of our subscribers!</p>

<p>It represents my entry into that age-old human legacy of attempts to bring beauty, truth, and love together in a real and meaningful way, however small. In keeping with that spirit, I want to bring this collection into the world as a pocketbook.

<h2><strong>SUMARIO </strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Introducción </h3>
<p>Hola me llamo David Puerta, i desde que descubrí el LN2, mi ilusión siempre ha sido tener una heladería usando el nitrógeno liquido. Al ver que este tipo de negocio tiene un valor de inversión mucho mas elevado que la heladería tradicional, pensé que seria buena idea empezar por abajo, por eso cree una empresa de catering que se dedica a hacer postres , helados, piruletas con nitrógeno liquido, i así pasado un tiempo poder llegar a tener mi propia heladería.</p>
<h3>Objetivo</h3>
<p>El objetivo es poder finalizar el diseño de esta maquina y posteriormente comercializarla. Nuestro objetivo es vender exclusivamente la maquina junto a una franquicia de heladería nitro. Mediante esta formula queremos conseguir crear una marca así poder vincular la exclusividad de la maquina a la marca. Para la comercialización i expansión de la marca o franquicia ofreceremos a nuestros clientes todos los formatos posibles de negocio,  adaptándonos en cada momento a las inversiones económicas del cliente franquicia. Diseñamos Heladeria Pop up en (contenedores marítimos) hasta heladerías en grandes locales i pasando por stands, carritos de helados o Food tracks.</p>
<h3>Soluciones</h3>
<p>Hacemos el helado dentro de la tarrina esta el la solución que ofrece nuestro prototipo i el diseño de esta maquina, también reduce el tiempo i el coste del producto final en un 65% respecto a las otras maquinas que elaboran helado con LN2 i que hoy en día se encuentran en el mercado. Hay estudios que avalan que el consumidor busca cada vez mas productos sanos, hechos al momento i de calidad, esto es exactamente lo que ofrece una heladería nitro que elabora el producto delante del cliente.</p>
<h3>Ventajas</h3>
<p>Nos dimos cuenta que el problema del helado hecho con nitrógeno LN2 es el coste en si i el tiempo de elaboración, frente al helado tradicional, pero también es cierto que tiene ventajas como:</p>
<p>Crear y elaborar helados con sabores personalizados a gusto de cada cliente.</p>
<p>Mejora la calidad, creamos un helado con una textura mas suave y cremosa.</p>

<h3>El Mercado</h3>
<p>El mercado es más competitivo que nunca y está muy fragmentado. Las empresas apuestan por el lanzamiento de helados artesanales. La innovación en el sector emula a otros mercados y se provee de las materias primas con productores locales. Las empresas apuestan por la diferenciación de marca y de los puntos de venta, utilizando para ello los envases como elementos diferenciales.

If you think that Putin and his regime are dangerous for the whole world – you are absolutely right. And you can help other people know the truth about him.</p><p>We wrote a book “Putin. Visible and Invisible. Enemy or Friend?”. We had to left Russia (Moscow) because of aggressive policy of Putin’s regime and became political refugees in Finland. The book was written by all three members of our family (my parents and me).</p><p>We left successful business, familiar environment, friends in order to keep the main freedom – freedom of speech, freedom to tell people the truth about what is really happening in Russia. My father was seriously and chronically ill, and we could not endanger him by participating in rallies, etc. You sometimes hear about well-known Russian opposition figures, like Navalny, and their actions, but you don’t hear anything about ordinary people who dared to speak out against Power and simply disappeared or went to prison for their views. Therefore, our family decided to leave Russia and become political refugees and fight against the criminal regime with words, helping people learn about what Putin is doing and what is hidden behind his actions.</p><p>My father died in 2019, he died far from his homeland, in obscurity, without waiting for the decision on political asylum. But he died happy, because his family was near him, and my father did what he considered the most important – he wrote for people to help them remain free, as he was free, no matter what. Dad also wrote books for children, making his dream come true, but that’s a completely different story.</p><p>My mother and me continue our joint work and invite you to become a part of our team – team of people who care about what will happen to the World next.</p><p>The book consists of separate chapters-articles (98 chapters), which were written in different years (2017-2020). They are focused on various subjects, political and social events, but they are all about Putin, the Kremlin, Russia and the World.</p><p>We ask your help in publication and marketing of printed book and marketing of ebook “Putin. Visible and Invisible. Enemy or Friend?”</p><p>The book is based on information obtained from open sources, including official statements by the Kremlin and its propagandists. “Putin. Visible and Invisible. Enemy or Friend?” allows people to understand who Putin is, what he is doing, and most importantly, what his actions really mean and what is behind them.</p><p>The authors of the book deliberately chose the path of political refugees in order to be able to tell the world about the crimes of the Putin’s regime, knowing how little the West (most people) is really informed about what is happening inside Russia and how it threatens everyone in the world, not least due to very effective Kremlin propaganda. Three years of permanent work, which has a sole purpose – the fight against the criminal Putin’s regime.</p><p>“Putin. Visible and Invisible.

If you think that Putin and his regime are dangerous for the whole world – you are absolutely right. And you can help other people know the truth about him.We wrote a book “Putin. Visible and Invisible. Enemy or Friend?”. We had to left Russia (Moscow) because of aggressive policy of Putin’s regime and became political refugees in Finland. The book was written by all three members of our family (my parents and me).We left successful business, familiar environment, friends in order to keep the main freedom – freedom of speech, freedom to tell people the truth about what is really happening in Russia. My father was seriously and chronically ill, and we could not endanger him by participating in rallies, etc. You sometimes hear about well-known Russian opposition figures, like Navalny, and their actions, but you don’t hear anything about ordinary people who dared to speak out against Power and simply disappeared or went to prison for their views. Therefore, our family decided to leave Russia and become political refugees and fight against the criminal regime with words, helping people learn about what Putin is doing and what is hidden behind his actions.My father died in 2019, he died far from his homeland, in obscurity, without waiting for the decision on political asylum. But he died happy, because his family was near him, and my father did what he considered the most important – he wrote for people to help them remain free, as he was free, no matter what. Dad also wrote books for children, making his dream come true, but that’s a completely different story.My mother and me continue our joint work and invite you to become a part of our team – team of people who care about what will happen to the World next.The book consists of separate chapters-articles (98 chapters), which were written in different years (2017-2020). They are focused on various subjects, political and social events, but they are all about Putin, the Kremlin, Russia and the World.We ask your help in publication and marketing of printed book and marketing of ebook “Putin. Visible and Invisible. Enemy or Friend?”The book is based on information obtained from open sources, including official statements by the Kremlin and its propagandists. “Putin. Visible and Invisible. Enemy or Friend?” allows people to understand who Putin is, what he is doing, and most importantly, what his actions really mean and what is behind them.The authors of the book deliberately chose the path of political refugees in order to be able to tell the world about the crimes of the Putin’s regime, knowing how little the West (most people) is really informed about what is happening inside Russia and how it threatens everyone in the world, not least due to very effective Kremlin propaganda. Three years of permanent work, which has a sole purpose – the fight against the criminal Putin’s regime.“Putin. Visible and Invisible. Enemy or Friend?” is addressed to people from different countries, of different social status and with different interests. The book is written so that it is understandable for both those who are sophisticated in politics and those who are practically not interested in it. It touches on facts known to many (the occupation of the Crimea, the war in Ukraine, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, etc.), as well as facts little known to people outside of Russia. “Putin. Visible and Invisible. Enemy or Friend?” aims to give them a more detailed picture of the situation in Russia and the foreign policy of the Kremlin.People must understand who Putin is, otherwise they will be defenseless against him. Therefore, in “Putin. Visible and Invisible. Enemy or Friend?” various periods of Russian history are considered in combination with the Kremlin’s propaganda, which actively uses the past and present to influence the minds of people around the world.You can really bring the book to a wide audience to compete against Putin at the level of people’s minds.If you can’t help financially, you can help simply by telling your relatives, friends, colleagues about this campaign.

You can find my list of film credits on IMDB - http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1479226/.  My book, 4 Years To A TV Deal, is a memoir and how-to book chronicling my experiences and efforts to break into television without an agent or manager. My book is compiled of four years of real life stories about conceiving, developing, writing and pitching TV series concepts to a top 5 television network.    In 2010 I gambled on the TV industry and focused my screenwriting and producing efforts on TV series development.  Four years later the gamble paid off!  It's still paying off: the TV industry is booming -- it's bigger than ever and the need for content has never been greater.Television is expanding with a BIG BANG.  The world is binging on content, and with a hunger so voracious, now is the perfect time for ANY creative individual to make his or her mark in the TV biz. You don't have to be an insider to break through. You just have to know the right steps to take to be taken seriously.That's ME directing my favorite actors in The Broken Hearts ClubWhat's INSIDE the book:It took 4 years of trial and error, success and failure, to land my first TV pilot development deal with NBCUniversal. Thirty days later I landed a second deal with the network. I accomplished this starting with no knowledge of the business, no connections, no contacts, and no representation. In 4 Years To A TV Deal I tell you exactly what I did and how I did it, and most importantly, what worked and what didn't so you can do it too.I went from being an obscure independent filmmaker to becoming a regular fixture at NBUniversal offices. I cannot tell you how cool it is to walk into a building on the Universal Studios Lot and the veteran Security Guard knows your name.  I met with the scripted and unscripted departments of NBC Drama, NBC Comedy, Bravo, Esquire, and many more.  It was always exciting, but it wasn't always fun, and it was never easy.My book is a hybrid of my professional aspirations and personal endeavors including working with the Independent Film & Television Alliance (IFTA) and attending several Development Needs meetings with NBCUniversal and its affiliates. My book culminates four years later, with the scary challenges of collaboration and meeting deadline to present final draft pilot scripts to two television networks. On set in LA for my romantic dramedy turned miniseriesProceeds  from this Indiegogo campaign will help me complete, edit, publish, print and market my book, 4 Years To A TV Deal. In it I share my process, my ups and downs, successes, failures and learning lessons. I'll share the defining moment that transformed me from a trembling writer sitting in a boardroom into a confident storyteller who could pitch anyone at any time. 4 Years To A TV Deal chronicles every aspect of my journey so you can learn from and duplicate my results.In 4 Years To A TV Deal I reflect in detail about how I went from sitting in a crowd of independent filmmakers to meeting one-on-one with network executives.   The rest, as they say, is history. It begins with my indie film MY INDIE FILMSBroken Hearts Club which had its premiere at the Hollywood Black Film Festival. See the trailer below: Resurrection of Serious Rogers. was released electronically and reached 32,000+ downloads all over the world: Marcus and I at the E! Entertainment offices to pitch...again!I've never worked for a studio. I am just an artist -- like you -- who loves film, television, writing and creating. However, I was able to help ten (10) men and women, writers and authors from Los Angeles to Ohio, Arizona to Georgia, San Francisco to North Carolina, refine their ideas and get pitch meetings with network TV executives.In four years of pitching to NBCUniversal  I also learned how to write one-sheets, proposals and pitch documents. Writing a series pitch proposal is nothing like writing a screenplay.  Crafting such documents is definitely an acquired skill and I'll show you how to so it simply and effectively. On the road to Filmart in Hong Kong. You'll learn:
When to craft a one-sheet or a five-page proposal or a series bible.
How to fully familiarize a TV executive with an unfamiliar subject in one sentence.
The truth about Releases and Indemnity.
5 buzzkill words to avoid saying during a pitch meeting.
What really happens during a pilot development deal?
How to avoid the two biggest mistakes I ever made as an executive producer.

Three sure ways to get past the executive's assistant.
Why the assistant is your #1 best contact at the network.
How to be memorable in the room and after.
How to get more money out of your Contract/Agreement.
Who's $%#$*@ meeting is it anyway, yours or theirs?
Why you should be nervous?
What's the #1 purpose/goal of your first pitch meeting, and why people blow it
Pitching in pairs? What to do when your partner goes off the rails
Why your idea sucks...until you do this one thing
How to craft a logline/elevator pitch that blows minds
Who should speak more during the pitch, you or the executive?
The ugly downside of collaboration and executive producing
How to vet your story/idea/concept to see if it truly works
The one thing you absolutely must do to pitch unscripted/reality

Proceeds from this Indiegogo campaign will go towards hiring an established editor, book design, original photography, layout, printing, publishing, marketing, perks and Indiegogo fees. TV writing and production is Angelo's career and he is constantly working to develop new material, concepts and stories to pitch and produce. Work in this area may, at times, delay the forward progress of editing, book design, marketing etc.My partner in crime, Ramona, and me on the lot at a NBCUniversal Development Needs MeetingI'M GOING ALL-OUT WITH THIS AUTHOR THING! I love everything about writing and every form of writing. But I wanted to earn the title of ""author."" So, I haven't merely written my how-to book, 4 Years To A TV Deal.  I've written an action-packed mystery-thriller as well.  When you support this campaign you can ore-order an advance copy of my first fiction novel, A PERFECT WEAPON. A PERFECT WEAPON is my gritty  and sexy psychological action thriller about a disgraced U.S. Marshal who is given a final chance at redemption when he's reinstated to track down an escaped female prisoner suspected of international terrorism. His pursuit of the woman becomes complicated by his sexual obsession and  a deadly conspiracy that threatens his every move. Ultimately he must decide if uncovering the truth is more dangerous than capturing this seductive assassin. The story is an adaptation of my action thriller screenplay of the title that a producer compared to No Country For Old Men, by the Coen brothers.  I imagined what the trailer would look like if one of my favorite directors, Tony Scott, was directing the movie, so I created a interesting proof-of-concept trailer...https://vimeo.com/77215926Note: the individuals in the trailer are no longer associated with the movie. This is for reference only. But trust me, the book is more sexy, more provocative, and more badass than the trailer! Met Dionna at the GAPF and got her meetings with Oxygen, BET and TLCIN CLOSING...I'd be grateful if you support my efforts in yet another important and upward transition in my career as a writer. In return I hope that sharing my ideas, experiences, successes and failures in pitching to TV execs helps you hold onto your dream of writing for television.  If you have ever felt like you have the perfect idea for a TV series you should never give up on that dream.  It took me four years to get a paid TV deal -- but it happened!  It can happen for you too, and much quicker! *images used here are for reference only and do not necessarily depict the design of the final item or book available as a perk.*images, video and likenesses used herein does not constitute personal endorsement of the book or its contents.*shipping outside of the US to Canada only because its development process most closely resembles that of the USA.",8.0,2,"11 Campaigns

I release and promote books myself. Sell between  5-10,000 ebook copies over few years (based on previous books) , never break out of ""christian"" categories.
Do
Sell 15,000+ e-books, Stock print books in many christian books stores, obtain best seller status on non-christian categories, spread the word via social media, start to build a vaild voice for other christian authors.

Risks & Challenges
 

The books have been written and are getting edited now, their is no risk they won't get done or created in print and e-book formats..
Risk, that while we push hard, the book proves unpopular and doesn't do well.
Best thing to do is read it first, and see if you like it ! or at least think it will sell.


Other Ways You Can Help
The mission here is to get the christian voice in the global e-book market, as such you can help, even if you can't pledge In fact the greatest help will be people sharing this campaign.

Post on you're own social media, facebook and email lists
Mention to church groups or home groups
Pray for our success
Help promote other books and review them no amazon!

If you made it this far i thank you, with the rewards i hope you want to read the book yourself, but i also know, for some people, they support the idea, but they know they aren't the ""target market"". If this is you, i would still hope you see value in getting a book like this into peoples hands and can help me do so.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Our online magazine was created on 30 September 2016, just a few weeks after the British EU Referendum and a couple of months before the election of Donald Trump at the White House.</p>
<p><strong>What's in the name:</strong> Our magazine's name, <i>PoliticsMeansPolitics.com,</i> comes from the days when the then-newly appointed British Prime Minister Theresa May kept repeating in the media <i>""Brexit means Brexit""</i>, after the EU Referendum.</p>
<p><strong>Why PoliticsMeansPolitics.com exists: </strong>We are a weekly politics and current affairs magazine with one clear objective: Fighting the fake stories out there with real ones!</p>
<p><strong>Our slogan:</strong> <i>""Debunking the usual untruth about politics and getting the facts right.""</i></p>
<p><strong>Our mission:</strong> To inform and educate to make a social impact. After Brexit and Trump, it is now time to fight back and stand up for truth and facts, or our ability to make informed decisions will be forever compromised.</p>
<p>We have created PREMIUM, a new platform for citizen response, because, unlike other media who focus on superficial news, irrelevant stories, fake news and alternative facts, we believe that some stories out there MUST be told.</p>
<p>We believe that PREMIUM should not provide its readers with stories they 'want' to read, but with stories they 'need' to read to understand the world they live in.</p>
<p><strong>Where our magazine politically stands:</strong> We are a British pro-EU weekly online magazine. We also believe in social equality, equal opportunity, the promotion of individual abilities and talents, social responsibility, universal healthcare, workers rights, entrepreneurship, fair market competition, access to education and culture for all, consumer rights, the prohibition of child labour, the fight against racism and antisemitism, and in the fight against global warming.</p>
<p><strong>Our audience:</strong> We have a growing number of followers and, on average, tens of thousands of readers choose to read our articles every day. Our magazine has received over 574k views in the last quarter all pages combined. We also currently have over 5k registered readers to our weekly Newsletter. Although our target audience is English speaking readers mainly located in the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia, we also have readers in many other countries in the world, simply because the issues raised in our magazine are global and affect people everywhere on the planet.</p>
<p>There are two ways to read the magazine:</p>
<p><strong>Read the magazine</strong><strong> (light):</strong> <i><a href=""https://PoliticsMeansPolitics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PoliticsMeansPolitics.com</a></i> </p>
<p><strong>Read the magazine (full version - with Premium stories)</strong><strong>:</strong> <a href=""http://vip.politicsmeanspolitics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>PoliticsMeansPolitics.com</i></a></p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why becoming a supporter now?</h3>
<p>More and more readers follow our magazine every day because they like the content we offer and believe in our <strong>quality, independent and fair journalism</strong>.</p>
<p>We want to keep this trend growing.</p>
<p>For that reason, we want to keep having a magazine <strong>based on trust</strong> (with our readers and with our authors) and the knowledge that <strong>no story we publish can be dropped</strong> because of censorship or political pressure.</p>
<p>To <strong>remain independent</strong> though is difficult and expensive, as our advertising revenues are too small to help us maintain our growth and <strong>we don’t have billionaire owners</strong>, nor shareholders who could add capitals in a snap of fingers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510334443/fprcejtbv9tmyujdgugm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>What we have is the understanding of the connections between <strong>good, independent, ethical journalism</strong> and <strong>democracy</strong> in a post-Brexit / post-Trump world. Our independent journalism considers the news <strong>from a different angle</strong> you may feel you can relate to.</p>
<p>So, if you like our work, <strong>please show your support</strong>. A one-off contribution to the work of our magazine will be greatly appreciated. Your contribution will <strong>guaranty we can continue</strong> to bring you great quality and independent articles <strong>to fight the fake stories</strong> out there… with real ones!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How will the money be spent?</strong></h3>
<p>- Most of our articles are made freely available to our readers on our online magazine (our Top Stories from our Top Writers are available on our PREMIUM area to our subscribers, via paywall). However, it takes a lot of time to set them up, edit them, get all comments and facts right. Some of the money will go towards cost-effective admin techniques and apps that will help us run the website in a more proficient manner.</p>
<p><br/>- A lot of people asked if there could be a print edition and we would love to produce one, that would remain free, of course. We will work towards producing a high-quality A4 size monthly or bi-monthly print edition of our magazine in the months to come. Distribution would be through our website as an e-magazine to start with.</p>
<p><br/>- Finally, <strong>we love our contributors</strong>. We want to help all our contributors to continue feeding our magazine with great quality content. Therefore, some of the money will be used <strong>to fund our writers</strong> for the articles they produce.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What will the magazine look like with the money?</strong></h3>
<p>We will:<br/>- Open our columns to journalists, writers, bloggers, politicians, business leaders, economists, lawyers, thinkers and anyone who wants to discuss political decisions, social issues, innovative ideas, original projects and complex schemes.<br/>- Open our columns to anyone who wants to tell their story, share their experience, explain their views, describe their pain, show their enthusiasm, demonstrate their joy, talk about their life.<br/>- Open our columns to all writers with progressive opinions, whether they are Left-wing or Right-wing, as long as they support democracy, human rights, diversity and selflessness.<br/>- Fight fake news published by right-wing outlets and tabloids and social media bots by publishing real, honest and positive news and opinions.<br/>- Fight politicians' alternative facts that threaten the democratic debate by fact-checking their speeches and comments to maintain transparency, honesty and democracy in politics.<br/>- Go to the source of the reflections that influence politics and geopolitics in the changing world of today.<br/>- Feed our readers with the most trustworthy, accurate and fact-checked information.</p>

Our mission: To inform and educate to make a social impact. After Brexit and Trump, it is now time to fight back and stand up for truth and facts, or our ability to make informed decisions will be forever compromised.
We have created PREMIUM, a new platform for citizen response, because, unlike other media who focus on superficial news, irrelevant stories, fake news and alternative facts, we believe that some stories out there MUST be told.
We believe that PREMIUM should not provide its readers with stories they 'want' to read, but with stories they 'need' to read to understand the world they live in.
Where our magazine politically stands: We are a British pro-EU weekly online magazine. We also believe in social equality, equal opportunity, the promotion of individual abilities and talents, social responsibility, universal healthcare, workers rights, entrepreneurship, fair market competition, access to education and culture for all, consumer rights, the prohibition of child labour, the fight against racism and antisemitism, and in the fight against global warming.
Our audience: We have a growing number of followers and, on average, tens of thousands of readers choose to read our articles every day. Our magazine has received over 574k views in the last quarter all pages combined. We also currently have over 5k registered readers to our weekly Newsletter. Although our target audience is English speaking readers mainly located in the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia, we also have readers in many other countries in the world, simply because the issues raised in our magazine are global and affect people everywhere on the planet.
There are two ways to read the magazine:
Read the magazine (light): PoliticsMeansPolitics.com 
Read the magazine (full version - with Premium stories): PoliticsMeansPolitics.com
 

 

Why becoming a supporter now?
More and more readers follow our magazine every day because they like the content we offer and believe in our quality, independent and fair journalism.
We want to keep this trend growing.
For that reason, we want to keep having a magazine based on trust (with our readers and with our authors) and the knowledge that no story we publish can be dropped because of censorship or political pressure.
To remain independent though is difficult and expensive, as our advertising revenues are too small to help us maintain our growth and we don’t have billionaire owners, nor shareholders who could add capitals in a snap of fingers.
 

 
What we have is the understanding of the connections between good, independent, ethical journalism and democracy in a post-Brexit / post-Trump world. Our independent journalism considers the news from a different angle you may feel you can relate to.
So, if you like our work, please show your support. A one-off contribution to the work of our magazine will be greatly appreciated. Your contribution will guaranty we can continue to bring you great quality and independent articles to fight the fake stories out there… with real ones!
 
How will the money be spent?
- Most of our articles are made freely available to our readers on our online magazine (our Top Stories from our Top Writers are available on our PREMIUM area to our subscribers, via paywall). However, it takes a lot of time to set them up, edit them, get all comments and facts right. Some of the money will go towards cost-effective admin techniques and apps that will help us run the website in a more proficient manner.
- A lot of people asked if there could be a print edition and we would love to produce one, that would remain free, of course. We will work towards producing a high-quality A4 size monthly or bi-monthly print edition of our magazine in the months to come. Distribution would be through our website as an e-magazine to start with.
- Finally, we love our contributors. We want to help all our contributors to continue feeding our magazine with great quality content. Therefore, some of the money will be used to fund our writers for the articles they produce.
 
What will the magazine look like with the money?
We will:- Open our columns to journalists, writers, bloggers, politicians, business leaders, economists, lawyers, thinkers and anyone who wants to discuss political decisions, social issues, innovative ideas, original projects and complex schemes.- Open our columns to anyone who wants to tell their story, share their experience, explain their views, describe their pain, show their enthusiasm, demonstrate their joy, talk about their life.- Open our columns to all writers with progressive opinions, whether they are Left-wing or Right-wing, as long as they support democracy, human rights, diversity and selflessness.- Fight fake news published by right-wing outlets and tabloids and social media bots by publishing real, honest and positive news and opinions.- Fight politicians' alternative facts that threaten the democratic debate by fact-checking their speeches and comments to maintain transparency, honesty and democracy in politics.- Go to the source of the reflections that influence politics and geopolitics in the changing world of today.- Feed our readers with the most trustworthy, accurate and fact-checked information.
 

 

The future of independent journalism is at stake. PoliticsMeansPolitics.com will fight for it!

<br/><p><br/></p>
<h2><b>Learn!</b></h2>
<p>Learn something new every day - Beijingerous is full of interesting, 
amusing and enlightening facts about Chinese culture. Read actual travel
 stories and learn from others' experiences. Learn more about habits, 
pop-culture, food, history, environment, symbols, language and many 
other interesting topics. Master Chinese eating habits, learn to order 
food in a hot pot restaurant, surprise your new local friends with slang phrases, haggle with Chinese hand signs and many other cool and 
useful articles, such as discovering secret meaning of numeric language in 
China: <i>Did you know that 5201314 in Chinese means ""I love you forever?""
</i></p>
<h2>Speak!</h2>
<p>No matter where in the world you travel you will always experience more 
when you can speak the same language as the locals. Learning Chinese might be hard if you aren't familiar with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion-Eating_Poet_in_the_Stone_Den"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""shishishishishi""-poem</a>, let us demostrate a bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl><dd><i>"" Shíshì shīshì Shī Shì, shì shī, shì shí shí shī.</i></dd></dl>
<i>
</i><dl><dd><i>In a stone den was a poet with the family name Shi, who was a lion addict, and had resolved to eat ten lions. ""</i></dd></dl>
</blockquote>Beautiful and simple, isn't it?<br/><br/>Beijingerous makes your 
social situations much easier with not only useful phrases based on 
actual situations, but also with full spelling help and characters, and an  extremely smart ""pointing out pictures""- section! It's a perfect way to 
communicate for socially awkward travelers!<br/><br/><h2>Experience!</h2>
<p>We made several surveys and interviewed tens of people and asked 
""What would you most want to do on your holiday/while traveling?"" Can you guess 
what was the most answered reply was?
</p>
<p>""To experience the culture the way locals see it.""</p>
<p>Beijingerous lets you to do things like locals. Instead of focusing 
fully on crowded tourist attractions it suggests for example...<br/>... to wake up early and head to Ritan park for free Taichi-lessons. <br/>...to get safely lost in Nanluoguxiang hutongs and eat barbecue sticks from street grills.<br/>... to take a night walk around Xidan just for the neon lights.<br/>... to haggle like a pro in a grand morning market in distant East-Beijing. <br/>... to spend a night meeting new people at local English classes in exchange for a Chinese meal. <br/>...to visit famous the Lama Temple to hear ancient Tibetan chanting. <br/>... to travel to rural neighborhoods for breakfast and watch old men playing street chess.<br/>... to walk on a distant part of The Great Wall.
</p>
<p>Instead of just giving you address and monotonic descriptions of the 
locations, it actually suggests how to get there, what you should try
 and when is the best time to visit. It doesn't teach you history, but 
it takes you on a cultural adventure.<br/><br/>Beijingerous also gives you 
various options depending on your budget and bravery! Imagine yourself 
tasting grilled scorpions on a stick in front of horrified locals... 
What, did we hear no? Ok, then imagine yourself tasting <i>tanghulu</i> - 
candied fruits on a stick, how about that?</p>
<h2>Live!</h2>
<p>You could surely book a fancy hotel in the heart of Beijing, but we encourage you to try alternative options: rent a room at a student 
community, sleep at a rural side of the town at a local family's house
 or get a budget hotel just below the Great Wall!<br/> Buy yourself a <i>yikatong</i> and travel cheaper using buses and subways! Get a Chinese 
mobile prepaid card and surprise your friends with multimedia messages! 
Beijingerous is full of  life hacks and tips to make your stay at 
Beijing much easier, cheaper and local!

<br/>
<h3>It all started in 1998.</h3> <p>I was six years old when my godmother took me to the movies to see Disney's Mulan.<br/>It was my first real movie experience and was very exciting. I was dazzled by the beauty of China. It was so colorful, exotic and different than our culture here in Finland. I lost my heart and soul to Chinese culture.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>""I lost my heart and soul to Chinese culture right away after seeing Disney's Mulan. And there was no turning back. Ever.""</b><br/></p></blockquote>
<p>I started to collect Chinese characters in note books and wanted to know everything. At the age of 10 I got my first own Chinese textbooks and started learning Mandarin Chinese. I read lots of books about China and watched many documentaries. I was often bullied in school because back then it was very weird to have such strong interests in odd cultures and languages. I didn't give up though, and kept reading. My biggest dream was to visit China when I was old enough.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Not the culture I was looking for.</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I had just celebrated my 18th birthday when I moved to Beijing for a short-term internship. It was like I'd come home. All the pictures and stories from the books I'd read suddenly came alive. I knew the culture so well that it wasn't weird, it felt like  home already on the first day. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>""When I visited Beijing for the first time, I knew the culture so well that it wasn't weird at all. It felt like I was at home.""</b><br/></p></blockquote>
<p>I visited all the famous tourist attractions on my first days and I must say I was very disappointed. The packed Forbidden City with dozens of similar red houses and dusty relics behind dirty windows was not what I came to see.<br/>Sure, the historic value of The Forbidden City is high, but it wasn't the kind of culture I wanted to experience.<br/></p>
<p>The culture I came for was everywhere else than in the tourist guides. It was in the streets of my neighborhood where old men played street-chess early on Sunday mornings. It was in waiter's smile when I asked for a bath (yù) instead of fish (yú) at small snack bar on the outskirts of town. It was at the Kung-fu lessons my friend took me to at the park. It was at local market halls when I haggled aggressively with a vendor and she laughingly invited me to dinner after furious yelling at each other. It was at all the Chinese lessons I took at windowless skyscrapers - and most importantly, it was at the places I didn't realize to look at without throwing away my tourist guides.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>""The packed Forbidden City with dozens of similar red houses 
and dusty relics behind dirty windows wasn't the Beijing I came to 
explore. The culture I came for was something I found when I threw away my tourist guides and lived life like a local Beijinger.</b>""<br/></p></blockquote>
<p>I was writing a blog back then about my times in Beijing, and many of the people I knew surprised me by asking if I was writing a book about my travels and travel tips. I started, but never fully finish it due to my busy student life.<br/>I graduated as a graphic designer in 2011 with high grades and a great portfolio. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Not for the €$¥£, but for the passion.<br/>
</h3>
<p>In 2012 I started my own business as a graphic designer and traveled back to Beijing the next year to meet my new business partners and make my boyfriend's wish come true: to visit China. I also kept writing my blog and my boyfriend told me that I was a truly amazing travel guide. I never thought that way at first - we were at my home.</p>
<p>Early this year I decided to travel back to Beijing and I found my old unfinished book. I saw an opportunity to finish it and maybe even turn my passion of China into something available for everyone. I could help people experience Beijing through local eyes and make visiting the city so much easier. <br/></p>
<p>I know that times are extremely hard for new travel guides, but after dozens of interviews and surveys I realized that the book I've been writing was exactly what people wanted.</p>
<p>Firstly, Beijingerous is not written to make me money. It is made from pure passion and dedication to Chinese culture. All the money we raise together goes to cover the different costs (see ""Risks"" for more information of funding). If this puts food in my mouth some day, I would be thrilled, but all I really want to see is my book to come alive in your hands and maybe even hear you find the same passion to for Chinese culture and Beijing as I have. <br/></p>
<blockquote><p><b>""Beijingerous is not written to make me money. It was written with pure passion and dedication to Chinese culture.""</b><br/></p></blockquote>
<p>Beijingerous is not exactly a travel guide, per se. It is much more; it is a small encyclopedia of Chinese culture and of Beijing itself. It has travel tips, but is more useful for someone who is going to study, work or live in Beijing, or for someone who is already living in Beijing. It's the guide you've always needed, it is like your local best friend.<br/></p>
<p>At this point, my passion and knowledge hasn't brought me enough money to make my book come alive<i><b>.</b></i><b><i> Since the book is made for YOU, I need your help.</i></b></p>

</div> <div> <h1>The Impact</h1>
<p><br/></p> <h4>Why should you support us?</h4>
<p>In the last year, people have started to emphasizing experiences, even on vacations. Today, the experience as a whole is what's most important. Before, trendy and inexpensive holiday-packs and stays at popular tourist-sites during high-season could sell out in mere days. Today, people want to DIY their vacations and holidays, often casting the traditional travel agencies aside. The growing supply and availability of services provided for travelers by the Internet has also made traveling easier. The modern traveler of today emphasizes the experience and the Spirit of adventure. Many of these experiences are however hidden in places that your average traveler wouldn't know about. Even though the demand for guides like Beijingerous is high, the supply is alarmingly low.<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Even though the Internet is good in providing services for travelers as well as an array of tips, people want more tangible material, something the can hold. The growing media-waste has made people lazy in  the sense that using social media </span>and<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> figuring out your internet while on vacation has become a </span>hassle<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and something people divert from, en masse. Books are almost invariably cited as the most trustworthy sources of information. It's much easier to use a high-quality informational book on the subject than looking for something amidst hours worth of information in hard places when you might not even be sure of what you're looking for. Add to that, that China is the promised land of internet-</span>censorship<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. It can be very hard and stressful in China when your internet-cable is out for the entire </span>neighborhood<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and the site that opens effortlessly in your home-country is inaccessible because of the </span>censorship<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.</span></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Why Beijing?</h4>
<p>Instead of writing an opus on the entire country, <span>it's easier as a writer</span> to chose one specific city that people are passionate about throughout the entire publishing process from the big picture to the minute details. </p>
<p>With us pondering the locations are like-minded local adventurers as well as experts who's interest in the book are the same or greater than that of the reader him- or herself.<br/>These are the origins of the dream-guide of the adventure-seeking traveler <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">”Beijingerous - A complete guide to adventurous Beijing”.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Beijingerous wants to show the big travel-book publishers what kind of travel guides the traveler of today needs.</h2>
<h2>This is the optimal time for the adventure-guide. </h2>
</blockquote>
<p>We're not forgetting the idea of expanding into a family of books if the first campaign is successful... <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Our experience:</h4>
<p><b>Campaigner &amp; Graphic Designer</b><br/></p>
<p>The campaigner, Salla, has no prior experience with funding campaigns. Instead, the campaigner has a past in, and is experienced in writing blogs, for magazines and marketing; page-layout of magazines, books and various pamphlets; graphic design and entrepreneurship in the same field; four years of studies in photography in art school; as well as the experience of living in Beijing as an exchange-student, learning the culture and the language (see Basics). The campaigner has also designed and published several different ad campaigns for her customers both through her business and freelance. Therefor, the success of this project is foreseeable.</p>
<p><b>Experts</b><br/></p>
<p>The various experts and locals in the book are seasoned representatives in their own fields, but not all are known or cited. They are dedicated to their fields or their actions so their accounts and information is trustworthy, informative and factual. These experts are at our use voluntarily and free of charge as opposed to as in the old travel guides where the sponsors or payed adds are cited first - simply because they believe in us. By reading the book you'll learn more about these people!</p>
<p><b>The Translator</b><br/><br/>Malin has always been passionate about writing. So much so, that she knew how to write before she could read. Her first languages are Swedish and English, and she is equally strong in both. She's won awards for her poetry, and writes and translates both articles, manuals her own blog and does spell-checking for websites.</p>
<p>When Malin was 19, she moved to Paris to be with her then-boyfriend who was not Parisian and as all Frenchmen, hated all the city stood for. She didn't know anyone, or the language, and spent the first six months struggling. She was on her own from the start, so she went out and learned to know the city and its inhabitants, and her language-skills developed quickly and soon she was fluent to the point that she even spoke French at home. She stayed for four years, and returned to Finland. The call was so strong though, that next she ended up living in America for almost three years very soon after.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""I believe in this project, just as I trust and believe in Salla. This is the kind of book I wished for in the time before the smart-phone, when I walked around the city of Paris with a map and nothing else, knowing no-one and understanding very little. It gets you off the beaten track, takes you places you could only dream of, teaches you things and is an adventure in itself. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>When Salla did me the honor of asking me to translate, I immediately said yes. I think I know Salla well enough that I can keep the integrity of the book, translating Salla's voice and making this accessible to everyone. And after all - this is the kind of guide we've all been waiting for - emphasizing the experience of a city. This is not a book for tourists - it is for travelers.""<br/><br/><b>– Malin, the translator</b><br/>
</blockquote>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h1>Risks <br/>
</h1>
<p>Beijingerous is a fixed-funding campaign and has minimum risks. That means, that if we don't meet the minimum funding goal on time; the project will not be funded and all backers get their money back. There are not other hidden costs. Design, photography and art will be provided by the campaigner at zero cost.<br/></p>
<p>The campaigner's travel costs to Beijing are already fully funded and the budget is composed mostly of printing costs and perks. See budget baozi below for full view of charges.</p>

</div></div>","""Beijingerous - A complete guide to adventurous Beijing"" is a new, interesting and smart way to explore Beijing.
It is not an ordinary travel book. It is the travel book you've always 
wanted. Beijingerous is like your local best friend taking you on an 
adventure.It encourages you to experience, taste, learn, and live the local 
lifestyle during your stay in Beijing. 



Learn!
Learn something new every day - Beijingerous is full of interesting, 
amusing and enlightening facts about Chinese culture. Read actual travel
 stories and learn from others' experiences. Learn more about habits, 
pop-culture, food, history, environment, symbols, language and many 
other interesting topics. Master Chinese eating habits, learn to order 
food in a hot pot restaurant, surprise your new local friends with slang phrases, haggle with Chinese hand signs and many other cool and 
useful articles, such as discovering secret meaning of numeric language in 
China: Did you know that 5201314 in Chinese means ""I love you forever?""

Speak!
No matter where in the world you travel you will always experience more 
when you can speak the same language as the locals. Learning Chinese might be hard if you aren't familiar with ""shishishishishi""-poem, let us demostrate a bit:

"" Shíshì shīshì Shī Shì, shì shī, shì shí shí shī.

In a stone den was a poet with the family name Shi, who was a lion addict, and had resolved to eat ten lions. ""
Beautiful and simple, isn't it?Beijingerous makes your 
social situations much easier with not only useful phrases based on 
actual situations, but also with full spelling help and characters, and an  extremely smart ""pointing out pictures""- section! It's a perfect way to 
communicate for socially awkward travelers!Experience!
We made several surveys and interviewed tens of people and asked 
""What would you most want to do on your holiday/while traveling?"" Can you guess 
what was the most answered reply was?

""To experience the culture the way locals see it.""
Beijingerous lets you to do things like locals. Instead of focusing 
fully on crowded tourist attractions it suggests for example...... to wake up early and head to Ritan park for free Taichi-lessons. ...to get safely lost in Nanluoguxiang hutongs and eat barbecue sticks from street grills.... to take a night walk around Xidan just for the neon lights.... to haggle like a pro in a grand morning market in distant East-Beijing. ... to spend a night meeting new people at local English classes in exchange for a Chinese meal. ...to visit famous the Lama Temple to hear ancient Tibetan chanting. ... to travel to rural neighborhoods for breakfast and watch old men playing street chess.... to walk on a distant part of The Great Wall.

Instead of just giving you address and monotonic descriptions of the 
locations, it actually suggests how to get there, what you should try
 and when is the best time to visit. It doesn't teach you history, but 
it takes you on a cultural adventure.Beijingerous also gives you 
various options depending on your budget and bravery! Imagine yourself 
tasting grilled scorpions on a stick in front of horrified locals... 
What, did we hear no? Ok, then imagine yourself tasting tanghulu - 
candied fruits on a stick, how about that?
Live!
You could surely book a fancy hotel in the heart of Beijing, but we encourage you to try alternative options: rent a room at a student 
community, sleep at a rural side of the town at a local family's house
 or get a budget hotel just below the Great Wall! Buy yourself a yikatong and travel cheaper using buses and subways! Get a Chinese 
mobile prepaid card and surprise your friends with multimedia messages! 
Beijingerous is full of  life hacks and tips to make your stay at 
Beijing much easier, cheaper and local!


Beijingerous is a ground-breaking and smart combination of pictured 
phrases, actual travel stories, interesting culture facts, useful 
tutorials and hints, not forgetting fully instructed guides to many 
fascinating attractions and experiences!- It is all you need to alternatively    experience Beijing like a local! 



It all started in 1998. I was six years old when my godmother took me to the movies to see Disney's Mulan.It was my first real movie experience and was very exciting. I was dazzled by the beauty of China. It was so colorful, exotic and different than our culture here in Finland. I lost my heart and soul to Chinese culture.
""I lost my heart and soul to Chinese culture right away after seeing Disney's Mulan. And there was no turning back. Ever.""
I started to collect Chinese characters in note books and wanted to know everything. At the age of 10 I got my first own Chinese textbooks and started learning Mandarin Chinese. I read lots of books about China and watched many documentaries. I was often bullied in school because back then it was very weird to have such strong interests in odd cultures and languages. I didn't give up though, and kept reading. My biggest dream was to visit China when I was old enough.

Not the culture I was looking for.

I had just celebrated my 18th birthday when I moved to Beijing for a short-term internship. It was like I'd come home. All the pictures and stories from the books I'd read suddenly came alive. I knew the culture so well that it wasn't weird, it felt like  home already on the first day. 
""When I visited Beijing for the first time, I knew the culture so well that it wasn't weird at all. It felt like I was at home.""
I visited all the famous tourist attractions on my first days and I must say I was very disappointed. The packed Forbidden City with dozens of similar red houses and dusty relics behind dirty windows was not what I came to see.Sure, the historic value of The Forbidden City is high, but it wasn't the kind of culture I wanted to experience.
The culture I came for was everywhere else than in the tourist guides. It was in the streets of my neighborhood where old men played street-chess early on Sunday mornings. It was in waiter's smile when I asked for a bath (yù) instead of fish (yú) at small snack bar on the outskirts of town. It was at the Kung-fu lessons my friend took me to at the park. It was at local market halls when I haggled aggressively with a vendor and she laughingly invited me to dinner after furious yelling at each other. It was at all the Chinese lessons I took at windowless skyscrapers - and most importantly, it was at the places I didn't realize to look at without throwing away my tourist guides.
""The packed Forbidden City with dozens of similar red houses 
and dusty relics behind dirty windows wasn't the Beijing I came to 
explore. The culture I came for was something I found when I threw away my tourist guides and lived life like a local Beijinger.""
I was writing a blog back then about my times in Beijing, and many of the people I knew surprised me by asking if I was writing a book about my travels and travel tips. I started, but never fully finish it due to my busy student life.I graduated as a graphic designer in 2011 with high grades and a great portfolio. 

Not for the €$¥£, but for the passion.

In 2012 I started my own business as a graphic designer and traveled back to Beijing the next year to meet my new business partners and make my boyfriend's wish come true: to visit China. I also kept writing my blog and my boyfriend told me that I was a truly amazing travel guide. I never thought that way at first - we were at my home.
Early this year I decided to travel back to Beijing and I found my old unfinished book. I saw an opportunity to finish it and maybe even turn my passion of China into something available for everyone. I could help people experience Beijing through local eyes and make visiting the city so much easier. 
I know that times are extremely hard for new travel guides, but after dozens of interviews and surveys I realized that the book I've been writing was exactly what people wanted.
Firstly, Beijingerous is not written to make me money. It is made from pure passion and dedication to Chinese culture. All the money we raise together goes to cover the different costs (see ""Risks"" for more information of funding). If this puts food in my mouth some day, I would be thrilled, but all I really want to see is my book to come alive in your hands and maybe even hear you find the same passion to for Chinese culture and Beijing as I have. 
""Beijingerous is not written to make me money. It was written with pure passion and dedication to Chinese culture.""
Beijingerous is not exactly a travel guide, per se. It is much more; it is a small encyclopedia of Chinese culture and of Beijing itself. It has travel tips, but is more useful for someone who is going to study, work or live in Beijing, or for someone who is already living in Beijing. It's the guide you've always needed, it is like your local best friend.
At this point, my passion and knowledge hasn't brought me enough money to make my book come alive. Since the book is made for YOU, I need your help.


Let's get the book printed and your adventure in Beijing begin!


- Salla, Tampere 27.6.2015

  

One of the campaign posters. Download and print one here!

What We Need & What You Get
Our minimum goal is 3800 euros. With 3800 euros we can get 500 printed books, a proper translation and spellcheck, and fund the rest of the SLR camera we need to get high quality pictures and paid perks for you the reader.
WHY 500 PIECES?

500 pieces is considered a good amount for a first self-published book. 500 pieces is what we've counted based on interest and demand on the market right now. All the books which aren't pre-ordered via Indiegogo will be sold online and if demand is met we will print more books. If interest and funding grows we will add additional books to be pre-ordered.

FOR EVERY EXTRA 500€ WE CAN PRINT AN ADDITIONAL 150 BOOKS. 

WHY SHOULD YOU FUND US – AND WHAT YOU GET?





PERKS:
Some of you might not have an interest in getting a book so we chose various options for you to show your support! Instead of purchasing the book you can receive gifts from Beijing to explore the city yourself from your sofa... and maybe you'll get excited too! We will get in touch with every donator via email when the campaign is over, so be sure to add us to your e-mail address-book!

















 *1st/2nd class air mail depending on your country or residence. If you wish to get registered airmail please contact us and we will calculate a shipping price**During 2.9-3.10.2015. Travel costs are not included, traveling at your own expense.
  The Impact
 Why should you support us?
In the last year, people have started to emphasizing experiences, even on vacations. Today, the experience as a whole is what's most important. Before, trendy and inexpensive holiday-packs and stays at popular tourist-sites during high-season could sell out in mere days. Today, people want to DIY their vacations and holidays, often casting the traditional travel agencies aside. The growing supply and availability of services provided for travelers by the Internet has also made traveling easier. The modern traveler of today emphasizes the experience and the Spirit of adventure. Many of these experiences are however hidden in places that your average traveler wouldn't know about. Even though the demand for guides like Beijingerous is high, the supply is alarmingly low.Even though the Internet is good in providing services for travelers as well as an array of tips, people want more tangible material, something the can hold. The growing media-waste has made people lazy in  the sense that using social media and figuring out your internet while on vacation has become a hassle and something people divert from, en masse. Books are almost invariably cited as the most trustworthy sources of information. It's much easier to use a high-quality informational book on the subject than looking for something amidst hours worth of information in hard places when you might not even be sure of what you're looking for. Add to that, that China is the promised land of internet-censorship. It can be very hard and stressful in China when your internet-cable is out for the entire neighborhood and the site that opens effortlessly in your home-country is inaccessible because of the censorship.

Why Beijing?
Instead of writing an opus on the entire country, it's easier as a writer to chose one specific city that people are passionate about throughout the entire publishing process from the big picture to the minute details. 
With us pondering the locations are like-minded local adventurers as well as experts who's interest in the book are the same or greater than that of the reader him- or herself.These are the origins of the dream-guide of the adventure-seeking traveler ”Beijingerous - A complete guide to adventurous Beijing”.


Beijingerous wants to show the big travel-book publishers what kind of travel guides the traveler of today needs.
This is the optimal time for the adventure-guide. 

We're not forgetting the idea of expanding into a family of books if the first campaign is successful... 

Our experience:
Campaigner & Graphic Designer
The campaigner, Salla, has no prior experience with funding campaigns. Instead, the campaigner has a past in, and is experienced in writing blogs, for magazines and marketing; page-layout of magazines, books and various pamphlets; graphic design and entrepreneurship in the same field; four years of studies in photography in art school; as well as the experience of living in Beijing as an exchange-student, learning the culture and the language (see Basics). The campaigner has also designed and published several different ad campaigns for her customers both through her business and freelance. Therefor, the success of this project is foreseeable.
Experts
The various experts and locals in the book are seasoned representatives in their own fields, but not all are known or cited. They are dedicated to their fields or their actions so their accounts and information is trustworthy, informative and factual. These experts are at our use voluntarily and free of charge as opposed to as in the old travel guides where the sponsors or payed adds are cited first - simply because they believe in us. By reading the book you'll learn more about these people!
The TranslatorMalin has always been passionate about writing. So much so, that she knew how to write before she could read. Her first languages are Swedish and English, and she is equally strong in both. She's won awards for her poetry, and writes and translates both articles, manuals her own blog and does spell-checking for websites.
When Malin was 19, she moved to Paris to be with her then-boyfriend who was not Parisian and as all Frenchmen, hated all the city stood for. She didn't know anyone, or the language, and spent the first six months struggling. She was on her own from the start, so she went out and learned to know the city and its inhabitants, and her language-skills developed quickly and soon she was fluent to the point that she even spoke French at home. She stayed for four years, and returned to Finland. The call was so strong though, that next she ended up living in America for almost three years very soon after.

""I believe in this project, just as I trust and believe in Salla. This is the kind of book I wished for in the time before the smart-phone, when I walked around the city of Paris with a map and nothing else, knowing no-one and understanding very little. It gets you off the beaten track, takes you places you could only dream of, teaches you things and is an adventure in itself. 

When Salla did me the honor of asking me to translate, I immediately said yes. I think I know Salla well enough that I can keep the integrity of the book, translating Salla's voice and making this accessible to everyone. And after all - this is the kind of guide we've all been waiting for - emphasizing the experience of a city. This is not a book for tourists - it is for travelers.""– Malin, the translator


   Risks 

Beijingerous is a fixed-funding campaign and has minimum risks. That means, that if we don't meet the minimum funding goal on time; the project will not be funded and all backers get their money back. There are not other hidden costs. Design, photography and art will be provided by the campaigner at zero cost.
The campaigner's travel costs to Beijing are already fully funded and the budget is composed mostly of printing costs and perks. See budget baozi below for full view of charges.







Costs explained:

Printing: Approximate printing costs for 500 books with 160 pages each make up the biggest part of the budget, around 1700 euros (including shipping&handling). Printing will be done by trusted long-time business partner and quality is guaranteed with every print. Books will have hard cover and wire binding.

Perks: Most expensive part of your perks are shipping costs. We don't want you to have any hidden fees after donating, you get what you donate for - no matter where you live, we deliver (1st/2nd class air shipping, registered airmail must be paid by the donator).
Fees: 10% of the budget is going to all different fees. Indiegogo 4%, Paypal 2,9% (+0,30€) and the rest 2-3% is reserved for credit/debit card handling fees via Paypal.

Camera: 300€ budget in Indiegogo and rest of the costs campaigner will invest by herself. Camera must be SLR camera. Right now, we only have a generic low-pixel digital camera.  FULLY FUNDED! 300€ of this budget will now used to organize raffle to all contributors!

Translation: With only 500€ (omg how generous offer!) will we get this book translated and proof-read by Malin Blomqvist! A tiny part of the budget goes to Chinese proof reader.

<h3>Proyecto KYOU KARA ORE WA LOLI NO HIMO [ESPAÑOL]</h3>
<p>El propósito de este proyecto es apoyar la traducción de novelas ligeras al español profesional. Seguro ya están hartos de leer un montón de incoherencias linea a linea en esas fast-novels que tanto abundan en Internet. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>¿Qué harán con el dinero?</h3>
<p>Cubrir los costos de la traducción. Tiempo que el traductor destinará para acabar el proyecto. Recordemos que es una persona que se está alzando en este mundo emergente de las novelas ligeras. También se debe cubrir la maquetación de la novela para quienes deseen tenerla en formato físico. Los formatos digitales serán Epub y pdf. Quienes apoyen el proyecto recibirán de manera anticipada estás últimas dos versiones. </p>
<h3><strong>¿El traductor... sabe traducir?</strong></h3>
<p>El traductor ha trabajado de manera independiente a lo largo de los años en traducción de episodios de anime, películas y otros materiales referentes al mundo del anime. Podemos dar fe de su trayectoria y de la calidad de su trabajo. </p>
<h3>¿Me meteré en problemas por apoyar este proyecto?</h3>
<p>No. Todo el contenido de la novela está en regla. Por lo menos, el autor original de la novela Akatsuki Yuki y su ilustrador Henreader no están tras las rejas ni tienen procesos legales abiertos xd.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>¿Por qué debería apoyar este tipo de proyectos?</h3>
<p>Hasta hace poco las editoriales sentían miedo en entrar en este mundo de las novelas ligeras, pero debido al éxito que vino con los mangas licenciados y el fandom del anime en toda hispanoamerica, es importante que desde ya comencemos a apoyar a estos traductores para que se unan a las filas de traductores y logren hacernos llegar más de estas obras fascinantes que hasta ahora sólo podíamos conseguir en japón. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>¿Riesgos?</h3>
<p>Más que riesgos, el único inconveniente sería un retraso por porte del traductor. Pero esperamos tener listo el volumen en unos 6 meses. Por eso es importante el apoyo constante. Si logramos cumplir la meta el Traductor tendrá todas las herramientas y garantías necesarias para completar el proyecto. </p>

<p>Greetings everyone!  My name is Justin Guyton but many know me as Rubbercity J the freelance music producer, live sound and studio engineer.  With your help I will be able to add self-published author to that list.  I was asked by a few friends to share why everyone should support this campaign they've launched on my behalf.</p>
<p>Felon: The New Slur Word is a must read for anyone that is serious about prison reform or who wants to know the uncut truth about the system.  Due to the mistakes that I made in my past, I've been incarcerated 10 years on a 25 year sentence for aggravated robbery.  My life experiences have made me the perfect candidate to provide the world the proper insight of what getting ensnared in the web of the criminal justice system entails.</p>
<p>The term felon in today's society is used to degrade and discriminate against regular people that have simply made mistakes.  Although some people's mistakes may not lead to incarceration, nobody is perfect.  We all know someone that has been in prison, but there hasn’t been many prisoners willing to shed light on what really occurs in the system.  I decided to take a leap of faith and share my truth through writing Felon: The New Slur Word.</p>
<p>Through sharing my story I believe that many lives will be impacted in a variety of ways.  My book has the ability to make individuals reflect on their lives and give them the needed insight to change.  This book also gives any reader that's an advocate for prison reform all of the knowledge that's needed to properly address the flaws within the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>This is important to me because everyday I see first hand many of the injustices that are never brought to light.  There are numerous stories that need to be told and your support of this campaign will allow me to bring those stories to the forefront of the public's eyes.  During 2019 we all heard the stories about the unjust tribulations that Alice Marie Johnson and Meek Mill faced through their experiences with the criminal justice system.  Sadly, there are countless prisoners with similar stories whose voices haven't been heard.</p>
<p>I have encountered prisoners that are serving 228 to 528 years for non-homicidal offenses.  I've met juvenile offenders that have been sentenced to thousands of years along with nonviolent drug offenders that have been sentenced to more time in prison than offenders of some heinous crimes.  There are even a few individuals that have been proven factually innocent of their crimes but still are incarcerated.  Regrettably, I have even witnessed prisoners die behind inadequate medical treatment.  At a time when mass incarceration and prison reform initiatives are being widely discussed, prisoner's with stories like these need to be heard.  If you know someone that is incarcerated you need to read this book.</p>
<p>By you supporting this campaign we will be able to self-publish Felon: The New Slur Word.  Through publishing this nonfiction book we will be granted with the opportunity to establish a platform that will allow for us to bring forth the stories that need to be told.  This will be accomplished through publishing future titles, establishing a website, not to mention a podcast which will be utilized to shed light on the injustices of the system.</p>
<p>To be able to sustain and grow our platform we're setting a goal of of 2,020 preorders of Felon: The New Slur Word for 2020.  Preorders are available for $15.  Achieving 2,020 preorder sales will allow us to publish 25 books written by incarcerated writers who have stories that need to be communicated.  In order to reach our 2,020 preorder goal for 2020, we will need approximately 34 preorders of Felon: The New Slur Word everyday until the end of our campaign.  Right now we need 40 people from every state in the U.S. to contribute to this campaign by preordering a copy of Felon: The New Slur Word.</p>
<p>Some of our future book titles will include links to soundtracks that will feature songs, spoken word poetry, and other commentary that will shed light on the travesties that occur behind state and federal penitentiary walls.  By letting the voices of those who are subjected to these conditions be heard.</p>
<p>We will also be releasing a series of books and albums whose proceeds will be used to aid the philanthropic mission of making mammograms accessible to women in underserved communities.  This is something that my late mother and I were working on prior to her passing.  In the same fashion, these projects will give prisoners the opportunity to participate in community service projects.  Such strategies will foster the mentality of uplifting the communities that these individuals once defiled.</p>
<p>To solely self-publish Felon: The New Slur Word $2,795 is needed.  This is an itemized list of how these funds will be spent.  $250 for a block of 10 ISBN's (International Standard Book Number).  When you have different formats of your book (i.e paperback, ebook, etc.) you will need a separate ISBN for each format.  An average book will need five ISBN’s since there are four formats of ebooks.  A single ISBN costs $125.  So, a block of 10 is the cheapest option.</p>
<p>$600 for the digital formatting of a 125-page manuscript and editing by Freebird Publishers.</p>
<p>$250 to have the edited manuscript indexed by a professional book indexer.</p>
<p>$450 to have a professional book cover designed by Freebird Publishers.</p>

<p>$275 to purchase the Gold Book Promotion Package from Freebird Publishers.  This package will get Felon: The New Slur Word listed on their website, in their catalog, and advertised on their web platforms for a period of one year.</p>
<p>$100 to establish the publishing company as a Limited Liability Company (LLC).</p>
<p>$125 to purchase a P.O. Box for one year.</p>
<p>$150 to have a custom website designed by Designed Conviction on the Wix platform.</p>
<p>$570 to purchase our web domain name and web hosting fees for Wix for two years.</p>
<p>To be able to establish the platform that we discussed which consists of publishing future titles, creating a podcast, together with producing soundtracks that will be employed to shed light on the injustices of the system, we will need to purchase the following:</p>
<p>$625 for a block of 100 ISBN's (International Standard Book Number).  When you have different formats of your book (i.e paperback, ebook, etc.) you will need a separate ISBN for each format.  An average book will need five ISBN’s since there are four formats of ebooks.  These ISBN's will be used for the authors titles that we will publish under our platform.</p>
<p>The next series of items are needed to produce our podcast and soundtracks.  With the exception of the laptop, all pieces of equipment will be purchased from Sweetwater ProGear.</p>
<p>$330 Acer Aspire 15.6in Laptop<br/>$600 Rode Rodecaster Pro<br/>$200 Rode PodMic with Boom Arm<br/>$200 PreSonus Audio Box 96 Studio<br/>$350 Zoom Q8 Handheld Video/Audio Recorder<br/>$750 Korg Kross 61-Key Keyboard Workstation<br/>$400 Korg Electribe</p>
<p>The total expense for the above needed items is $3,455 plus the $2,795 to publish Felon: The New Slur Word.  The price puts us at our campaign goal of $6,250.</p>
<p>The fulfillment of our 2,020 preorders of Felon: The New Slur Word goal will allow us to publish the stories of twenty-five incarcerated authors.  With doing most of the work in-house, we will be able to publish these authors works for an average of $1,200 per title.  For twenty-five books it will take $30K to be able to publish these authors.  With your help of reaching our goal of 2,020 preorders, this will provide us with the sufficient funding to do everything we have discussed in this campaign.  We have some great incentives that will allow us to achieve all of our goals and more.</p>

<p>This campaign will allow us to contribute to the push for prison reform.  Our goal is to reach 2,020 preorders of Felon: The New Slur World which will not only grant us with the opportunity to publish this book, but form a multifaceted platform.  The overwhelmingly majority of the incarcerated lacks the proper support system or celebrity backers to bring their stories of injustice to the limelight.  Your support of this campaign will allow us to highlight these stories.  We will produce and promote the stories of those who are unjustly buried alive in the criminal justice system.  Our forthcoming website, podcast, along with the YouTube channel will allow us to distribute these stories around the world.  We truly need your contributions in order for us to launch this platform.</p>
<p>One of the main challenges for us will be deciding what stories of prisoners to highlight first.  There are so many cases that deserve attention.  Our plan is through doing our due diligence we will decide which medium would be the best vehicle to bring each individual story to the forefront of the public's eyes.  This can be achieved through future books, our podcast, as well as promotion through our website.</p>
<p>We understand that everyone may not be in the financial position to contribute to our campaign.  You still have the power to help us reach our target goal through doing the following:<br/>*Help us promote this campaign by using the Indiegogo share tool. <br/>*Create and post blog stories on social media to bring awareness and drive traffic to our campaign.  Making this campaign go viral will help us reach the goals for this project. <br/>*Tell all of your friends and family members to preorder a copy of Felon: The New Slur Word. <br/>*Refer stories to us that we should highlight through our platform and our future books.  This can be done through emailing us at teamblowboi@gmail.com.  We truly appreciate all levels of support.  Without your help, none of this could be accomplished.</p>

$150 to have a custom website designed by Designed Conviction on the Wix platform.
$570 to purchase our web domain name and web hosting fees for Wix for two years.
To be able to establish the platform that we discussed which consists of publishing future titles, creating a podcast, together with producing soundtracks that will be employed to shed light on the injustices of the system, we will need to purchase the following:
$625 for a block of 100 ISBN's (International Standard Book Number).  When you have different formats of your book (i.e paperback, ebook, etc.) you will need a separate ISBN for each format.  An average book will need five ISBN’s since there are four formats of ebooks.  These ISBN's will be used for the authors titles that we will publish under our platform.
The next series of items are needed to produce our podcast and soundtracks.  With the exception of the laptop, all pieces of equipment will be purchased from Sweetwater ProGear.
$330 Acer Aspire 15.6in Laptop$600 Rode Rodecaster Pro$200 Rode PodMic with Boom Arm$200 PreSonus Audio Box 96 Studio$350 Zoom Q8 Handheld Video/Audio Recorder$750 Korg Kross 61-Key Keyboard Workstation$400 Korg Electribe
The total expense for the above needed items is $3,455 plus the $2,795 to publish Felon: The New Slur Word.  The price puts us at our campaign goal of $6,250.
The fulfillment of our 2,020 preorders of Felon: The New Slur Word goal will allow us to publish the stories of twenty-five incarcerated authors.  With doing most of the work in-house, we will be able to publish these authors works for an average of $1,200 per title.  For twenty-five books it will take $30K to be able to publish these authors.  With your help of reaching our goal of 2,020 preorders, this will provide us with the sufficient funding to do everything we have discussed in this campaign.  We have some great incentives that will allow us to achieve all of our goals and more.

If we are not able to reach our funding goals we will use the funds that are raised to solely publish Felon: The New Slur Word in paperback and ebook formats.  We will reinvest all of the books proceeds into purchasing all of the equipment and services that we listed above.  We are committed to bringing awareness to the need for prison reform and will continue to work hard to secure our much needed platform.
This campaign will allow us to contribute to the push for prison reform.  Our goal is to reach 2,020 preorders of Felon: The New Slur World which will not only grant us with the opportunity to publish this book, but form a multifaceted platform.  The overwhelmingly majority of the incarcerated lacks the proper support system or celebrity backers to bring their stories of injustice to the limelight.  Your support of this campaign will allow us to highlight these stories.  We will produce and promote the stories of those who are unjustly buried alive in the criminal justice system.  Our forthcoming website, podcast, along with the YouTube channel will allow us to distribute these stories around the world.  We truly need your contributions in order for us to launch this platform.
One of the main challenges for us will be deciding what stories of prisoners to highlight first.  There are so many cases that deserve attention.  Our plan is through doing our due diligence we will decide which medium would be the best vehicle to bring each individual story to the forefront of the public's eyes.  This can be achieved through future books, our podcast, as well as promotion through our website.
We understand that everyone may not be in the financial position to contribute to our campaign.  You still have the power to help us reach our target goal through doing the following:*Help us promote this campaign by using the Indiegogo share tool. *Create and post blog stories on social media to bring awareness and drive traffic to our campaign.  Making this campaign go viral will help us reach the goals for this project. *Tell all of your friends and family members to preorder a copy of Felon: The New Slur Word. *Refer stories to us that we should highlight through our platform and our future books.  This can be done through emailing us at teamblowboi@gmail.com.  We truly appreciate all levels of support.  Without your help, none of this could be accomplished.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I'm Lena Gilmour, university student and aspiring author.  I've always been an avid reader and loved the process of writing and I am now finally ready to make my dreams a reality and pursue my passion of writing. The idea for ""The Heroine Standard"" had its beginnings in my high school days. I wrote an essay for my English class defending the character of Daisy Buchanan (we were reading ""The Great Gatsby"" at the time). The novel was my favourite, and Daisy one of the characters I loved reading about. When I started university, I began thinking about other characters who were widely hated despite often being the protagonists of their stories. That's when I decided to start penning ""The Heroine Standard,"" a novel that would defend these despised women against the stereotypes.</p>
<p>I'm asking for contributions to help make this dream into a reality. I am asking for your support to put ""The Heroine Standard"" on bookshelves around the world.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Here's Where This Campaign Comes In</h3>
<p>I am looking for YOUR help to cover the costs of hiring an editor and marketing this book. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I am asking for $1,000 to help cover living expenses while I work on my novel, as well as the costs of hiring an editor and marketing The Heroine Standard. I am a diligent, hardworking individual who goes above and beyond in everything I do. This project will not only be finished within the year, but will be accepted by an agent, I am sure, if only by sheer will alone! I am incredibly determined and have the drive needed to complete this project. </p>
<p>If I surpass my $1,000 goal, I will donate 10% of all profits to the Indigo Love of Reading (<a href=""http://www.loveofreading.org/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.loveofreading.org/en</a>)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here's How It's Going to Work</h3>
<p>Right now I am still in the midst of writing ""The Heroine Standard"". Once it is finished, it will be sent out to a list of beta readers who will review and critique. Once it has been edited to near-death, it will be prepped for send-off to literary agents.</p>
<p><strong>This is when you will receive your FREE PDF copy of The Heroine Standard! </strong></p>
<p>Every single person who contributes to this cause, no matter how big or small, will receive a free PDF copy of The Heroine Standard. </p>
<p>The manuscript will then be sent out to agents in the hopes of becoming accepted. If accepted, it will go through the process of publishing, and hit the bookshelves! </p>
<p>What Each Essay is Comprised Of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A discussion and defense of some of literature's most hated female characters, including, but not limited to Daisy Buchanan, Bella Swan, and Lady Macbeth</li>
<li>A discussion of the reasoning for readers' hatred for the character</li>
<li>Talking about their story and my idea of their reasoning for acting the way they do</li>
<li>Talking about the lovable attributes of the character </li>
<li>A discussion of whether they are redeemed by the end of the story</li>
<li>Conclusions about what the character teaches us through their faults </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I understand that you may have some qualms about contributing to something that will fund an unpublished, young author. But you have my word I will do NONE of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend the money donated on a wild shopping spree to Sephora (though the pretty signs may tempt me)</li>
<li>Waste my time watching Keeping up with the Kardashians rather than writing because a) I am too damn stubborn about finishing this novel and b) I can't freaking stand those girls</li>
<li>Go on a spur-of-the-moment trip to Guam because it's a cool-sounding name for a place </li>
<li>Not finish this amazing book</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>If you're strapped for cash but still want to help make ""The Heroine Standard"" a reality, here's how you can help.</h3>

<p>Just because you can't financially support the cause doesn't mean you can't help out!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Remember that $1 CAN make a HUGE difference.</strong> No matter how small the donations are, they add up. I promise you that $1 means so much more than you could ever know.</li>
<li>Post about my book on your social media! Get talking about this work and get the word out!</li>
<li>If you know someone who might be able to lend a hand in any way, please direct them to me! I could use all the support I can get!</li>

<h3>Who we are!</h3>
<p>Hello and welcome to our crowdfunding campaign!</p>
<p>We are a new small publishing group that specializes in light novels. Specifically, creating original English light novels for readers to enjoy!</p>
<p>Having 3 successfully published OELN(original English light novel) ‘s under our belt which have each held 4.5 to 5 star ratings on both Amazon and goodreads, we are looking to grow and publish works from other authors to bring readers more quality stories!</p>
<p>Under the <strong>Novel Horizon</strong>'s name we aim to bring great stories and the highest quality physical print into your hands.</p>
<p>You can support us knowing that excellent is always our top priority.</p>
<p><strong>Our successful released titles include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>One-Two-Five Volume 1 </strong>Action/Fantasy/Isekai</li>
<li>
<strong>One-Two-Five Volume 2  </strong>Action/Fantasy/Isekai</li>

<h3>About this Campaign </h3>
<p>This campaign is designed to help us release our Fall Line-up of Light novels. This is a total of 5 books that we plan to release by December of 2020 with our latest projection being for January of 2021. Which would take <strong>roughly 20,000$ USD </strong>at the bare minimum for all 5 titles. We optimally want to raise about <strong>32,000 USD</strong> though.</p>
<p>Because of the vast variety of rewards though, instead of creating a bunch of rewards and clogging up the page with all the possible combinations, we are offering a ""A la cart"" menu where backers can fully customize their reward packages. </p>
<p>Making full use of Indiegogo's system, the ""featured"" perk is the menu with all our items available as add-on's. </p>
<h3><strong>Limited Edition Merchandise Changes: </strong></h3>
<p>We've received alot of interest regarding our Limited Edition hardcover books in the past. </p>
<p>Previously, we printed a set amount of these, which left other backers unable to purchase them once they ""sold out"". </p>
<p>For this campaign, we want to experiment with instead making these Limited Edition hardcovers a crowdfunding exclusive item. Where we will print the exact amount backers ordered and no more after, effectively leaving them OOP once this campaign ends.</p>
<p>We hope this way, everyone can get the rewards they want while not taking away the value or charm of owning a Limited Edition item. </p>
<h3>Novel Formats</h3>
<p>Our <strong>Standard Edition</strong> novels will be printed in a 5x7 inch book format, featuring multiple black and white illustrations with a full color cover. Back will include some minor art and synopsis information. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599413991/fzcrj3aojmobgvxu6kaz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Limited Edition</strong> novels will be printed in a 5x8 inch book format, featuring <strong>alternate</strong> cover art for the front and back in full color. These are also printed as Hardcover copies among a few other fun changes. These will not be reprinted after this campaign.</p>

Under the Novel Horizon's name we aim to bring great stories and the highest quality physical print into your hands.
You can support us knowing that excellent is always our top priority.

About this Campaign 
This campaign is designed to help us release our Fall Line-up of Light novels. This is a total of 5 books that we plan to release by December of 2020 with our latest projection being for January of 2021. Which would take roughly 20,000$ USD at the bare minimum for all 5 titles. We optimally want to raise about 32,000 USD though.
Because of the vast variety of rewards though, instead of creating a bunch of rewards and clogging up the page with all the possible combinations, we are offering a ""A la cart"" menu where backers can fully customize their reward packages. 
Making full use of Indiegogo's system, the ""featured"" perk is the menu with all our items available as add-on's. 
Limited Edition Merchandise Changes: 
We've received alot of interest regarding our Limited Edition hardcover books in the past. 
Previously, we printed a set amount of these, which left other backers unable to purchase them once they ""sold out"". 
For this campaign, we want to experiment with instead making these Limited Edition hardcovers a crowdfunding exclusive item. Where we will print the exact amount backers ordered and no more after, effectively leaving them OOP once this campaign ends.
We hope this way, everyone can get the rewards they want while not taking away the value or charm of owning a Limited Edition item. 
Novel Formats
Our Standard Edition novels will be printed in a 5x7 inch book format, featuring multiple black and white illustrations with a full color cover. Back will include some minor art and synopsis information. 

Limited Edition novels will be printed in a 5x8 inch book format, featuring alternate cover art for the front and back in full color. These are also printed as Hardcover copies among a few other fun changes. These will not be reprinted after this campaign.

 
E-books will be in the standard PDF and EPUB formats.

The Impact
By helping us raise the amount we need, you not only get 1st edition high quality books, but also let us work toward becoming bigger and better publishers. That way we can continue spreading quality stories and bringing new authors whose stories would otherwise could unnoticed, into public light!
OELN's are often viewed with alot of scrutiny with a stigma of lacking both quality artwise and story wise, riddled with errors and being more ""fanwork"" than true pieces of literature. We want your help to shatter that perception. Starting here from step one.

<p align=""JUSTIFY"">Siamo studiosi ed esperti delle tematiche del diritto dell'immigrazione, antropologi,  sociologi, associazioni, fotografi, videomakers, giornalisti, grafici e fumettisti, tutti impegnati nell'attività per la tutela dei diritti umani che hanno deciso di mettere a disposizione di questo progetto le loro conoscenze ed esperienze per raccontare, attraverso le immagini e le parole, verità dimenticate o nascoste.   </p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">Ci siamo uniti per riuscire a realizzare insieme questo progetto d'inchiesta, investendo liberamente le nostre risorse personali, perché siamo convinti che soltanto grazie al lavoro di cooperazione tra diverse identità si possa arrivare a raggiungere il nostro obiettivo: diffondere la verità semplicemente raccontando i fatti affinché si realizzi un contributo di informazioni veritiero ed indipendente. </p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">Il progetto è interamente autofinanziato, riteniamo abbia un valore sociale e desideriamo condividere con chi vedrà il nostro lavoro tutto ciò che impareremo, analizzeremo, scopriremo, conosceremo. Abbiamo quindi deciso di cercare persone che abbiano voglia di sostenerci attraverso il crowdfunding. Per questo anche voi che sosterrete economicamente la campagna sarete parte dell'inchiesta. </p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">Nel momento in cui ""<i>Morti di CIE- storie di ordinaria detenzione amministrativa</i>"" vedrà la luce sarà merito di tutti noi e di tutti voi produttori dal basso! </p>

<p></p>""Cause of Death: CIE (Centers for Identification and Expulsion) –Stories of ordinary administrative detention"" is an autonomous and independent project. </div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">Our team is composed by human rights activists with a range of different competences ranging from Immigration Law experts and researchers, anthropologists, sociologits, members of civil society associations, photographers, videomakers, journalists, graphic designers and cartoonists. We have decided to put together our knowledge and expertise to report, through images and words, forgotten and hidden truths.

<p>Since the approval of Law n. 40/1998 (better known as “Turco-Napolitano” Law) and the subsequent Bossi-Fini Law of 2002, migrant detention has become a reality. With special centers intended for the identification and expulsion of “irregular migrants” being established all over the country. Those centers, initially known as Centers for Temporary Permanence (1998-2008), are now called CIE.</p>
<p>Administrative detention is a form of personal liberty deprivation to which irregular migrants waiting for expulsion are subjected, following an administrative violation (e.g., the non-possession of a residence permit).</p>
<p>Since 1998, thousands of people have been detained inside these centers and many of them have lost their lives there. Many of those deaths have been entirely forgotten, not even making news headlines. For this reason, it is crucially important for us to give a name and a face to these forgotten people, because behind each case there lies a story of denied dignity and a human life to be narrated.</p>

<p>Our intention is to shed light on every single case of death inside the Italian detention centers for irregular migrants. The investigation is aimed at analyzing how the Italian courts appraised and judged each legal case, and if anybody has been found guilty for these deaths.Our intent is not to pursue justice in courtrooms nor to replace public prosecutors, but rather to get a detailed knowledge of the facts, through the study of the court proceedings and the direct testimonies of those who have lived those moments firsthand in order to inform the public.</p>
<p>Above all, we want to account if and how the State, through its judges and public prosecutors’ Offices, took a stand on these episodes. We believe it is necessary to act instead of remaining passive spectators or accomplice witnesses of these stories.</p>
<p>We can no longer look away, pretending this is not happening.</p>

<p><b>À Propos de nous</b></p>
<p> « Cause de décès : CIE (Centres d'Identification et d'Expulsion) – Histories d'ordinaire détention administrative » c'est un projet autonome et indépendant. </p>
<p>Notre équipe est composée de militants des droits humains avec une gamme de compétences différentes allant d'experts en droit des migrations, à chercheurs, anthropologues, membres d'associations de la société civile, en passant par photographes, vidéastes, journalistes, graphistes et dessinateurs. Nous avons décidé de rassembler notre expertise et nos connaissances pour raconter en mots et en images des vérités oubliées et cachées. Nous nous sommes associés pour réaliser la présente enquête – en investissant nos forces et nos ressources – parce que nous croyons que c'est seulement par la coopération entre des individus d'horizon différents qu'il est possible d'offrir une information libre et indépendante. L'enquête – laquelle nous croyons avoir une valeur sociale importante – est entièrement autofinancée, et, donc, compte sur le soutien du public. Voilà pourquoi nous vous demandons de nous aider à rendre ce projet possible, en nous soutenant à travers le crowdfunding. </p>
<p>Lorsque « Cause de décès : CIE – Histories d'ordinaire détention administrative » verra le jour ce sera grâce à nous tous et à vous tous, crowdfunders !</p>
<p><b>Pourquoi cette enquête ?</b></p>
<p>Depuis l'approbation de la Loi n. 40/1998 (mieux connu sous le nom de « Turco-Napolitano » Loi) et de la Loi n. 189/2002 (Loi Bossi-Fini), la détention des migrants est devenu une réalité. Des centres spéciaux destinés à l'identification et l'expulsion des « migrants irréguliers « ont été établis dans tout le pays. Les centres, initialement connus sous le nom de Centres de Permanence Temporaire (1998-2008), sont maintenant appelés CIE. </p>
<p>La détention administrative est une forme de privation de liberté à laquelle sont soumis les migrants irréguliers en attente d'expulsion, suite à une infraction administrative (par exemple, l'absence de possession d'un permis de résidence). Depuis 1998, des milliers de personnes ont été détenues dans ces centres, et beaucoup d'entre elles y ont perdu la vie. Beaucoup de ces décès ont été complètement oubliés. </p>
<p>C'est pour cette raison qu'il est crucial pour nous de redonner un nom et un visage à ces personnes oubliées, parce que derrière chaque cas se cache une histoire de dignité refusée et une vie humaine qui mérite d'être racontée.</p>
<p><b>                Qu'est ce que nous voulons faire?</b></p>
<p> Le projet final sera composé de :</p>
<p> - Un livre ;</p>
<p>- Un e-Book ;</p>
<p>- Production visuelle ;</p>
<p>- Photos ;</p>
<p> - Coffret DVD ;</p>
<p>- Bande dessinée ;</p>
<p>- Site web ;</p>
<p> - Matériel promotionnel ;</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>De quoi s'agit-il et pourquoi devrais-je m'en soucier ?</b></p>
<p> Notre intention est de faire la lumière sur tous les cas de décès dans les centres de détention pour migrants irréguliers en Italie. L'enquête vise à analyser la façon dont les tribunaux italiens ont évalué et jugé chaque cas juridique, et si quelqu'un a été jugé coupable de ces décès. Notre intention n'est pas de rétablir la justice dans les salles d'audience, ni de remplacer les procureurs, mais plutôt d'obtenir une connaissance détaillée des faits, à travers l'étude des poursuites judiciaires et les témoignages directs de ceux qui ont vécu les événements de première main afin d'informer le public. Surtout, nous voulons expliquer si et comment l' 'État, à travers ses juges et les bureaux des procureurs, a pris une position sur ces épisodes. Nous croyons qu'il est nécessaire d'agir au lieu de rester des spectateurs passifs ou témoins complices de ces histoires. Nous ne pouvons plus détourner le regard et prétendre qu'il ne se passe rien.</p>
<p><b>Coûts du projet</b></p>
<p>Cette étude est à but non lucratif, et tous les membres de notre équipe travaillent sur une base volontaire. Malgré ça, il y a des coûts restant à couvrir, c'est pourquoi nous sollicitons votre aide et votre soutien. Ces coûts sont dus à :</p>
<p>- Dépenses de l'enquête (achat d'un domain; campagne de crowdfunding ; recherche ; voyages ; production du livre ; production ebook ; traductions ; vidéos ; post-production) ;</p>
<p>- Les coûts des activités de communication ;</p>
<p>- Les coûts de distribution ;</p>
<p>- Pecks et récompenses ;</p>
<p><b>Comment pouvez-vous contribuer ?</b></p>
<p>Pour réaliser cet ambitieux travail, nous avons besoin de votre aide et de votre soutien de sorte qu'il ne se transforme pas en un effort vain. Tout ce que vous pouvez faire est vraiment apprécié.</p>
<p><b>Que faire si vous ne pouvez pas faire de don ?</b></p>

""Morti di CIE - storie di ordinaria detenzione amministrativa"" è un progetto autonomo e indipendente. 
Siamo studiosi ed esperti delle tematiche del diritto dell'immigrazione, antropologi,  sociologi, associazioni, fotografi, videomakers, giornalisti, grafici e fumettisti, tutti impegnati nell'attività per la tutela dei diritti umani che hanno deciso di mettere a disposizione di questo progetto le loro conoscenze ed esperienze per raccontare, attraverso le immagini e le parole, verità dimenticate o nascoste.   
Ci siamo uniti per riuscire a realizzare insieme questo progetto d'inchiesta, investendo liberamente le nostre risorse personali, perché siamo convinti che soltanto grazie al lavoro di cooperazione tra diverse identità si possa arrivare a raggiungere il nostro obiettivo: diffondere la verità semplicemente raccontando i fatti affinché si realizzi un contributo di informazioni veritiero ed indipendente. 
Il progetto è interamente autofinanziato, riteniamo abbia un valore sociale e desideriamo condividere con chi vedrà il nostro lavoro tutto ciò che impareremo, analizzeremo, scopriremo, conosceremo. Abbiamo quindi deciso di cercare persone che abbiano voglia di sostenerci attraverso il crowdfunding. Per questo anche voi che sosterrete economicamente la campagna sarete parte dell'inchiesta. 
Nel momento in cui ""Morti di CIE- storie di ordinaria detenzione amministrativa"" vedrà la luce sarà merito di tutti noi e di tutti voi produttori dal basso! 


Dall’approvazione della Legge 40/1998, meglio conosciuta come Legge Turco-Napolitano passando per la Bossi-Fini del 2002, abbiamo imparato a conoscere il fenomeno dell’internamento dei migranti in strutture di detenzione per ""clandestini"", appositi centri di identificazione ed espulsione.
La detenzione amministrativa è una vera e propria privazione della libertà personale alla quale i migranti irregolari in attesa di allontanamento ed espulsione vengono sottoposti a seguito di una violazione amministrativa come, ad esempio, la mancanza del permesso di soggiorno. 
Da allora, migliaia sono state le persone rinchiuse dentro questi centri, e molti hanno visto la fine della loro esistenza proprio lì dentro. Molti sono stati dimenticati, e molti altri non hanno nemmeno fatto notizia. Crediamo quindi sia necessario ridare un nome e un volto a queste persone pensando che dietro ogni caso ci sia una dignità negata e storia di vita umana da raccontare.


                                          Il progetto finale si compone di:

Un documento cartaceo (libro)
Un documento elettronico (eBook)
Materiale video
Materiale fotografico 
Cofanetto dvd
Un fumetto

Un sito internet 
Materiale promozionale






Nella speranza di non continuare a contare altri morti, la nostra intenzione è far luce sui decessi avvenuti, parlare di queste morti e entrare nel dettaglio dei fatti, studiando i documenti per raccontarli, cercando di capire i perché è le cause dei decessi, ma soprattutto, raccontando come lo Stato, attraverso i giudici e i Pubblici Ministeri, si è pronunciato a seguito di questi fatti. 
Non sentendoci ispirati da quanti cercano di dare consiglio alla Magistratura nel giudizio di questi episodi, non reclamiamo il desiderio di sostituirci alle Procure della Repubblica o a quanti invocano altre finalità giustizialiste. Preferiamo esprimerci, secondo le modalità libere che qualificano ognuno, per fornire e condividere le nostre competenze invece che rimanere spettatori passivi e testimoni omertosi di una storia in corso. 
Dovrebbe interessare chiunque non abbia voglia di girare la testa per non guardare.





Costi generali di realizzazione dell’inchiesta (acquisto dominio, campagna crowdfunding, studio, spostamenti e realizzazione del cartaceo, del documento elettronico, traduzioni, produzione video e post-produzione)
Costi di comunicazione 
Costi di distribuzione

A daring inquiry about migrants' deaths in Italian administrative detention centers. 

""Cause of Death: CIE (Centers for Identification and Expulsion) –Stories of ordinary administrative detention"" is an autonomous and independent project. Our team is composed by human rights activists with a range of different competences ranging from Immigration Law experts and researchers, anthropologists, sociologits, members of civil society associations, photographers, videomakers, journalists, graphic designers and cartoonists. We have decided to put together our knowledge and expertise to report, through images and words, forgotten and hidden truths. We have teamed up to realize this inquiry -investing our strengths and resources – because we believe that only through cooperation between individuals with different backgrounds it is possible to make independent information. The inquiry - which we believe to have an important social value - is entirely self-financed, and thus necessarily relies on the support of the public. This is why we are calling out to all of you to join our project by supporting us through crowdfunding. 
When ""Cause of Death: CIE – Stories of ordinary administrative detention"" will come into being it will be thanks to all of us and all of you, crowdfunders!




Since the approval of Law n. 40/1998 (better known as “Turco-Napolitano” Law) and the subsequent Bossi-Fini Law of 2002, migrant detention has become a reality. With special centers intended for the identification and expulsion of “irregular migrants” being established all over the country. Those centers, initially known as Centers for Temporary Permanence (1998-2008), are now called CIE.
Administrative detention is a form of personal liberty deprivation to which irregular migrants waiting for expulsion are subjected, following an administrative violation (e.g., the non-possession of a residence permit).
Since 1998, thousands of people have been detained inside these centers and many of them have lost their lives there. Many of those deaths have been entirely forgotten, not even making news headlines. For this reason, it is crucially important for us to give a name and a face to these forgotten people, because behind each case there lies a story of denied dignity and a human life to be narrated.




                                         The final project will consist of:
1. A book
2. An e-book
3. Visual production
4. Photos
5.  Dvd box set
6. Comic book
7. Web site
8. Promotional material.




Our intention is to shed light on every single case of death inside the Italian detention centers for irregular migrants. The investigation is aimed at analyzing how the Italian courts appraised and judged each legal case, and if anybody has been found guilty for these deaths.Our intent is not to pursue justice in courtrooms nor to replace public prosecutors, but rather to get a detailed knowledge of the facts, through the study of the court proceedings and the direct testimonies of those who have lived those moments firsthand in order to inform the public.
Above all, we want to account if and how the State, through its judges and public prosecutors’ Offices, took a stand on these episodes. We believe it is necessary to act instead of remaining passive spectators or accomplice witnesses of these stories.
We can no longer look away, pretending this is not happening.



This is a nonprofit study, and all the members of our team are working on a voluntary basis.  There are still costs to be covered and this is why we are seeking out for your help and support. Those costs are due too: 
- Inquiry expenses(Domain's purchase; crowdfunding campaign; research; travels; production of the book, e-book, translations, videos and post-production);
- Costs related to communication activities;
- Distribution costs;
- Pecks and awards;
HOW CAN YOU CONTRIBUTE?
This brave act of solidarity and testimony needs your help and support so that it does not turn into a vain effort. Anything you can do is really appreciated. We need all the help we can get. 
AND WHAT IF YOU CANNOT MAKE A DONATION?
Don't worry, if you want you can share this campaign to help us find donors, organize a fund-raising event or an initiative to promote this project. Do not hesitate to contact us at http://www.mortidicie.org. We will post videos, comics, pictures and news every month to report this special journey step by step. Take a look now at Storie

Une enquête courageuse sur les décès de migrants détenus dans les centres de détention administrative italiens.
À Propos de nous
 « Cause de décès : CIE (Centres d'Identification et d'Expulsion) – Histories d'ordinaire détention administrative » c'est un projet autonome et indépendant. 
Notre équipe est composée de militants des droits humains avec une gamme de compétences différentes allant d'experts en droit des migrations, à chercheurs, anthropologues, membres d'associations de la société civile, en passant par photographes, vidéastes, journalistes, graphistes et dessinateurs. Nous avons décidé de rassembler notre expertise et nos connaissances pour raconter en mots et en images des vérités oubliées et cachées. Nous nous sommes associés pour réaliser la présente enquête – en investissant nos forces et nos ressources – parce que nous croyons que c'est seulement par la coopération entre des individus d'horizon différents qu'il est possible d'offrir une information libre et indépendante. L'enquête – laquelle nous croyons avoir une valeur sociale importante – est entièrement autofinancée, et, donc, compte sur le soutien du public. Voilà pourquoi nous vous demandons de nous aider à rendre ce projet possible, en nous soutenant à travers le crowdfunding. 
Lorsque « Cause de décès : CIE – Histories d'ordinaire détention administrative » verra le jour ce sera grâce à nous tous et à vous tous, crowdfunders !
Pourquoi cette enquête ?
Depuis l'approbation de la Loi n. 40/1998 (mieux connu sous le nom de « Turco-Napolitano » Loi) et de la Loi n. 189/2002 (Loi Bossi-Fini), la détention des migrants est devenu une réalité. Des centres spéciaux destinés à l'identification et l'expulsion des « migrants irréguliers « ont été établis dans tout le pays. Les centres, initialement connus sous le nom de Centres de Permanence Temporaire (1998-2008), sont maintenant appelés CIE. 
La détention administrative est une forme de privation de liberté à laquelle sont soumis les migrants irréguliers en attente d'expulsion, suite à une infraction administrative (par exemple, l'absence de possession d'un permis de résidence). Depuis 1998, des milliers de personnes ont été détenues dans ces centres, et beaucoup d'entre elles y ont perdu la vie. Beaucoup de ces décès ont été complètement oubliés. 
C'est pour cette raison qu'il est crucial pour nous de redonner un nom et un visage à ces personnes oubliées, parce que derrière chaque cas se cache une histoire de dignité refusée et une vie humaine qui mérite d'être racontée.
                Qu'est ce que nous voulons faire?
 Le projet final sera composé de :
 - Un livre ;
- Un e-Book ;
- Production visuelle ;
- Photos ;
 - Coffret DVD ;
- Bande dessinée ;
- Site web ;
 - Matériel promotionnel ;

De quoi s'agit-il et pourquoi devrais-je m'en soucier ?
 Notre intention est de faire la lumière sur tous les cas de décès dans les centres de détention pour migrants irréguliers en Italie. L'enquête vise à analyser la façon dont les tribunaux italiens ont évalué et jugé chaque cas juridique, et si quelqu'un a été jugé coupable de ces décès. Notre intention n'est pas de rétablir la justice dans les salles d'audience, ni de remplacer les procureurs, mais plutôt d'obtenir une connaissance détaillée des faits, à travers l'étude des poursuites judiciaires et les témoignages directs de ceux qui ont vécu les événements de première main afin d'informer le public. Surtout, nous voulons expliquer si et comment l' 'État, à travers ses juges et les bureaux des procureurs, a pris une position sur ces épisodes. Nous croyons qu'il est nécessaire d'agir au lieu de rester des spectateurs passifs ou témoins complices de ces histoires. Nous ne pouvons plus détourner le regard et prétendre qu'il ne se passe rien.
Coûts du projet
Cette étude est à but non lucratif, et tous les membres de notre équipe travaillent sur une base volontaire. Malgré ça, il y a des coûts restant à couvrir, c'est pourquoi nous sollicitons votre aide et votre soutien. Ces coûts sont dus à :
- Dépenses de l'enquête (achat d'un domain; campagne de crowdfunding ; recherche ; voyages ; production du livre ; production ebook ; traductions ; vidéos ; post-production) ;
- Les coûts des activités de communication ;
- Les coûts de distribution ;
- Pecks et récompenses ;

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">About</span></h3>
<p>Hi everybody, my name is Chris and I’m a Bible believing, spiritual foodie with a passion for children’s stories, books or film.  By way of education, I am trained in the way of the financial samurai (I have a degree in finance) but my pen keeps telling me I’m a wordsmith.  If you want to know about me, first things first, I have a relationship with Jesus and He directs my steps.  I’ve written several children’s books and each one is inspired by God.  My hope is that these books help you and your children think about God in an entertaining fashion.  Other than that, I’m a master of ideation.  Seriously, I have more ideas than I know what to do with…most of them are viable.  Lastly, if we ever cross paths, let me warn you, I am a quiet man.  A very, very quiet man; introvert is an understatement.  I do in fact speak, but it’s a struggle.  All in all, I just want to write stories that captivate the mind and transport you to your own personal dreamspace.</p>
<ul>
<li>My campaign is to raise $2,500 to illustrate and publish one of my first children’s books, Wings for a Day.  This is a product of my early penmanship, so its near and dear to my heart.</li>
<li>The contributors of this campaign are helping me to officially enter the ring as a children’s author.  Publishing Wings for a Day will help me gain credibility as a writer and establish my style.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>I’m seeking $2,500, and here’s where it will go:</p>
<ol>
<li>$1,500 for an Illustrator</li>
<li>$750 to print 50-100 hard cover books</li>
<li>$250 for platform/selling fees: ISBN number, Amazon, IndieGoGo, etc</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s a sad truth that I may not be able to raise the total funding amount.  Because this is a fixed campaign, if I fall short of my funding goal, all donations will be refunded to the contributors.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>Wings for a Day isn’t just children’s content slapped on a page.  It’s a story injected with truth and overlaid with prayer in an honest voice.  In my humble opinion, the world could really use some of that right about now.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>Every project has an assortment of challenges and constraints.  My most critical and, therefore, most risky assumption is that I can find a talented illustrator who can deliver illustrations in a format that’s consistent with my vision.  All that to say, I need a Rockstar.  Regardless of how challenging it may seem, I am confident that I will connect with the right person and he/she will illustrate the stuff of legend.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul><li>Let’s keep it real.  You may not be able to contribute financially, but you can help me in other ways.  Share my cause with your family and friends.  I already mentioned I’m a shy guy, so I could use all the help getting the word out that I can get.</li></ul>

<p>My name is Sam Hutchings, and since I got my first computer 20 years ago I have been obsessed with technology and the way it can change our lives. For the last 10 years I have been thinking, talking and writing on-and-off about technology and how it has impacted us.</p>
<p>In 2007, I launched bitcolumns.com, a tech site with a simple goal: deliver unbiased tech reviews to young people and students across the world, with a focus on budget-conscious users. Fast forward to 2015, and that's changed a bit. Bitcolumns is now a <a href=""https://medium.com/bitcolumns-medium"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Medium publication</a> where a select few share commentary and thoughts on Apple and the world around them. <b>Some of our pieces have had up to 11 thousand views with a 100% read rate.</b></p>
<p>The aim of this campaign is to get you, my friends and fellow Apple lovers, involved with my Apple Watch reviews and content. I'd love to review it, and I think many of you would love to read my thoughts on it, but I am not pally enough with Apple to get a review unit. I need to buy my own.</p>
<p>By supporting this campaign, you are part of bitcolumns history. I am considering this both an experiment and a great way to get you, my friends and community, involved.</p>
<h3 id="""">What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To pre-order an Apple Watch Sport review unit and fly to the UK to pick it up, I need to raise about £500. (I looked at shipping the Watch to Spain. It's about the same price and takes longer than if I just fly to the UK to get it). To be able to devote time to writing and bringing the thoughts to you, I need to raise another £500.</p><p>If I raise more, I'll be able to  deliver more reviews and thoughts on more Apple products now and in the future. (New MacBook reviews and thoughts, anyone?)</p>
<p>If you contribute at one of the following levels, you'll get access to the associated perk:</p>
<p>£1 - Thank You! Everybody who contributes at this level or above will get a thank you in a published ""Thank you"" piece.</p>
<p>£5 - Thank You! (with link). Exactly like the £1 perk, but your name on the ""Thank You!"" page will be linked to whatever social handle or web page you like (within reason).</p><p>£20 - Personalised Thank You! A personalised thank you from yours truly, including your name and a link to your social handle or website. There's a limited number of these available. </p>
<p>£300 - Article Sponsor. You'll sponsor a specific article within the collection. A mention and link to your site or product, or you, will be put at the beginning and the end of an article. If you have an Apple Watch product or app, this level gets you an article covering your product (you'll have to provide a code for the app or the product, of course). There's a limited number of these available.</p>
<p>£1,000 - Collection Sponsor. You'll get a mention as sponsor on every piece of Apple Watch content created as part of this campaign. This will include the ""First Day Thoughts"", ""A Week with Apple Watch"" and ""A Month on My Wrist"" pieces. There's only one of these available.</p>
<p>If the goal is not met, the collection of articles will have to be delayed until the extra funds can be found to get an Apple Watch on my wrist.</p>
<h3 id="""">The Impact</h3>
<p>By backing this campaign you make this become a reality. I will be able to write up my thoughts on and experiences with Apple Watch and publish them for bitcolumns on Medium. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are two big risks for this project.</p><p>1) We don't hit the goal, meaning this won't happen. No money will change hands.</p><p>2) Apple sells out of the Apple Watch ridiculously quickly. This would push back the timeframe for the article collection, as I wait for the device to be delivered.</p>
<p>If we don't meet the goal, the project isn't funded. This is an all or nothing endeavour.</p>

<p>Hi, everyone! I’m Eva, a 28-year-old girl from Slovenia. I own a company called EVING, which provides digital services such as graphic design, web development, photography, etc. I’m just a regular person with <strong>an idea to combine different stories by people from all around the world in one book</strong> – a very funny and exciting book everyone would love to read.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489389726/ld6o2npsfhhnwffnpbmm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>How did I get this idea for a book that introduces real-life stories by people from all over the world?</strong> Well, one day I was doing practically nothing – I was sitting in a swinging chair behind our holiday home, surrounded by nature. I started to think about my life, reminisce about certain events… So I remembered the first time I drove a car. My dad was sitting in the passenger seat, teaching me how to shift gears, steer the wheel, and so on. When I shifted into second gear and reached 20 km/h (12 mp/h), I was so very nervous. I said to myself, “Wow, what speed! I’m driving so fast!” Now, having accumulated 5 years of driving experience, I just laugh when I remember my excitement over going 20 km/h (12 mp/h). My experience of driving a car for the first time isn’t something I would like to publish in this book, but it certainly got me thinking that <strong>there must be millions of people around the world with even more exciting stories to tell about their first time doing something. </strong>And this was definitely something I was interested in and would have loved to read about right then and there. So I thought – what if I’m not alone? What if there are other people who would also be interested in reading these kind of stories? What if there’s a way I could publish a book with lots of different stories, all connected by one common thread, which is doing something for the first time? <strong>Would people be interested?</strong> Well, with the help of this IndieGoGo campaign, I can be certain of one thing at least: if there are enough pre-orders for the book, <strong>I can make it happen.</strong> If I reach <strong>my goal of $29,000,</strong> I will have enough funding to make this project go worldwide. If I don't reach the goal, contributors get <strong>all their money back - </strong>this campaign is set for fixed funding.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489877792/yg4wz27crhoo1bekxzws.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489335157/ndawpogrvqh9vwiv9fty.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>The main expense I have to consider in publishing the book are <strong>authors’ exclusive license fees. </strong>Every author whose story will be published in <i>My First Time</i> will receive <strong>$50 </strong>for the license to distribute their story. Since the book will contain <strong>200 stories</strong>, this amounts to $<u>10,000</u>, a sum that would be impossible to cover without this funding campaign.</p>
<p>The second biggest expense is <strong>editing the book.</strong> Selecting the most interesting stories out of thousands, proofreading the selected stories, etc. This cost cannot be adequately evaluated, because the number of submitted stories won’t be known until <strong>31 May 2017</strong> (if funding is successful), which is the predicted submission deadline. I estimate that $<u>8,500 will be needed</u> for this very important part of publishing the book.</p>
<p>A sum of $<u>7,000</u> is estimated for the <strong>printing and free shipping</strong> (in the USA) of 800 books. If there are more pre-orders than the planned 800, even better. Since the main distribution of the books will take place in the USA, I have discovered a way to distribute the books there at a low cost (shipping from the EU is very expensive). There is one catch to it, though: I cannot print hardcover books, only<strong> laminated paperbacks</strong>. This subject is still open for discussion – if there are many more pre-orders for the book than initially expected, I think I can somehow find a way to also print a hardcover edition of the book for the same amount of money as was first raised by this campaign.</p>
<p>The rest of the money will be used for <strong>promoting</strong> the project on social media, for the <strong>campaign fee</strong>, and for a contingency plan, should it need to be put in effect, i.e., should any <strong>unpredicted expenses</strong> arise. As I already mentioned, my expertise is <strong>graphic design</strong>, so I will take care of the book’s look and feel, design its cover, the accompanying webpage, etc. One expense less to worry about.</p>

Since the book will include only true real-life stories, I realize that some authors, those who don’t want everyone to know about their first-time experience of something, won’t like to be named, at least not by their real name. Authors can therefore also opt for a pseudonym. Their e-mail addresses will be safely stored in our database and won’t be made available to the public.</p>
<p><strong>Project success</strong>. I believe this project could be very successful if done right, if we publish stories that will entice as many people as possible. They say experiences enrich a person, which is also true of first-time experiences. This book will contain 200 different stories of first-time experiences by people from all around the world.</p>
<p>Take a trip down memory lane and remember when you first experienced the same kind of thing as the author of one of these stories. It’s in our human nature to be curious about other people’s lives and to compare ourselves to them. That’s why I think this book could make it big.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong>. Like in any other funding campaign, there are certain risks that I must consider. The biggest risk is that not enough stories will be submitted if this campaign reaches its goal. But I will solve this problem with Facebook ads and other advertising campaigns, so that people from all over the world will learn about my project. As I noticed in the past two weeks, people from Slovenia were very much interested not only in reading about other people’s experiences, but also in writing their own stories.</p>

I’m Eva, a 28-year-old girl from Slovenia. I own a company called EVING, which provides digital services such as graphic design, web development, photography, etc. I’m just a regular person with an idea to combine different stories by people from all around the world in one book – a very funny and exciting book everyone would love to read.

How did I get this idea for a book that introduces real-life stories by people from all over the world? Well, one day I was doing practically nothing – I was sitting in a swinging chair behind our holiday home, surrounded by nature. I started to think about my life, reminisce about certain events… So I remembered the first time I drove a car. My dad was sitting in the passenger seat, teaching me how to shift gears, steer the wheel, and so on. When I shifted into second gear and reached 20 km/h (12 mp/h), I was so very nervous. I said to myself, “Wow, what speed! I’m driving so fast!” Now, having accumulated 5 years of driving experience, I just laugh when I remember my excitement over going 20 km/h (12 mp/h). My experience of driving a car for the first time isn’t something I would like to publish in this book, but it certainly got me thinking that there must be millions of people around the world with even more exciting stories to tell about their first time doing something. And this was definitely something I was interested in and would have loved to read about right then and there. So I thought – what if I’m not alone? What if there are other people who would also be interested in reading these kind of stories? What if there’s a way I could publish a book with lots of different stories, all connected by one common thread, which is doing something for the first time? Would people be interested? Well, with the help of this IndieGoGo campaign, I can be certain of one thing at least: if there are enough pre-orders for the book, I can make it happen. If I reach my goal of $29,000, I will have enough funding to make this project go worldwide. If I don't reach the goal, contributors get all their money back - this campaign is set for fixed funding.

 


The main expense I have to consider in publishing the book are authors’ exclusive license fees. Every author whose story will be published in My First Time will receive $50 for the license to distribute their story. Since the book will contain 200 stories, this amounts to $10,000, a sum that would be impossible to cover without this funding campaign.
The second biggest expense is editing the book. Selecting the most interesting stories out of thousands, proofreading the selected stories, etc. This cost cannot be adequately evaluated, because the number of submitted stories won’t be known until 31 May 2017 (if funding is successful), which is the predicted submission deadline. I estimate that $8,500 will be needed for this very important part of publishing the book.
A sum of $7,000 is estimated for the printing and free shipping (in the USA) of 800 books. If there are more pre-orders than the planned 800, even better. Since the main distribution of the books will take place in the USA, I have discovered a way to distribute the books there at a low cost (shipping from the EU is very expensive). There is one catch to it, though: I cannot print hardcover books, only laminated paperbacks. This subject is still open for discussion – if there are many more pre-orders for the book than initially expected, I think I can somehow find a way to also print a hardcover edition of the book for the same amount of money as was first raised by this campaign.
The rest of the money will be used for promoting the project on social media, for the campaign fee, and for a contingency plan, should it need to be put in effect, i.e., should any unpredicted expenses arise. As I already mentioned, my expertise is graphic design, so I will take care of the book’s look and feel, design its cover, the accompanying webpage, etc. One expense less to worry about.
 

To all of my backers, who will support me and help me bring my idea to life, I will provide FREE SHIPPING of the book (in the continental US). Don’t miss our “early bird” pre-orders and save 25%.

A special edition of the book with 50 additional stories (e-book) will also be available for a limited period of time to those who will believe in me and help me the most.

A special hardcover edition with a personal thank you note and free delivery to anywhere in the world will be available only with the Special edition pack. You will also receive the biggest thank you among all the contributors, and will be acknowledged inside every printed book and e-book, on the webpage, and on the Facebook page.

We provide reseller packs for bookstores and other retailers who would like to invest in larger quantities of books and save up to 50%. Don't hesitate to check out all of our perks on this page.

 

Read some of the first stories that have been submitted by people from Slovenia and see what kind of reading material you can expect inside the book. It is not yet clear if any of these sample stories will be published in the final book, since not enough stories have been submitted for comparison at this point in the project timeline. We will choose only 200 of the most exciting, intriguing, and funny stories for publication.

Since the book will include only true real-life stories, I realize that some authors, those who don’t want everyone to know about their first-time experience of something, won’t like to be named, at least not by their real name.
