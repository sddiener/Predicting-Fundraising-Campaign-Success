<p>Hi. We’re Elisabeth Thurston Fraser and Miya Hirabayashi, founders of <a href=""http://www.youplusme.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YOU + ME*</a> and the ad-free publishing platform <a href=""http://www.equals.youplusme.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Equals</a>. For almost a year, we’ve been publishing essays and photography by talented women on our site. Now it’s time to go offline. </p>
<h3><strong>Our Project</strong></h3>
<p>We believe women who write brilliant essays about compelling topics deserve to have their work in print. And that words are best enjoyed in the company of gorgeous photos and considered layouts. It's our mission to publish not just one, but a series of publications that meet those criteria.</p>
<p>The inaugural print edition of <em>Equals</em> includes 30 essays around the theme of ""exploration,"" with four major sections devoted to cartography, uncharted territory, nostalgia, and souvenirs. Our contributors' words are enhanced by outstanding photography and custom illustrations. Here are just a few of our gorgeous spreads: <img alt=""Spread 1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://equals.youplusme.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/preview-11.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<strong>Our Contributors</strong> </h3>
<p>Below are just a handful of the incredible writers whose work will be featured in our pages: </p>
<p><strong>Melanie Biehle</strong> is a Creative Marketing Strategist, Storyteller, and Cool Things Sharer. She’s the founder of <a href=""http://inwardfacinggirl.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Inward Facing Girl</a>, where she documents her obsessions with creativity and psychology, contemporary art, design, photography, travel, magazines, and life in Seattle with The Adventure Club (aka, her husband and son). She optioned a romantic comedy screenplay in 2005, and her writing, graphic design, and photography have been featured on The Huffington Post, <em>Sunset Magazine</em>, Decor8, SF Girl by Bay, <em>UPPERCASE</em> and more.</p>
<p><strong>Erin Boyle</strong> is a freelance writer and photographer in Brooklyn, New York. She writes <a href=""http://www.readingmytealeaves.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Reading My Tea Leaves</a>, a daily lifestyle blog chronicling life in a tiny apartment and other adventures related to living simply and sustainably.</p>
<p><strong>Erin Loechner</strong>, a writer and former ad agency copywriter in Los Angeles, now resides in a sleepy Midwestern town with her husband Ken, daughter Bee and two dogs. A pioneer “design blogger” featuring trending products and lifestyle images, Loechner recently shifted her focus to a more personal quest for creativity on her award-winning site, <a href=""http://www.designformanknid.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Design for Mankind,</a> listed as one of The London Time’s top 50 design blogs in the world.

</div></div>","Hi. We’re Elisabeth Thurston Fraser and Miya Hirabayashi, founders of YOU + ME* and the ad-free publishing platform Equals. For almost a year, we’ve been publishing essays and photography by talented women on our site. Now it’s time to go offline. 
Our Project
We believe women who write brilliant essays about compelling topics deserve to have their work in print. And that words are best enjoyed in the company of gorgeous photos and considered layouts. It's our mission to publish not just one, but a series of publications that meet those criteria.
The inaugural print edition of Equals includes 30 essays around the theme of ""exploration,"" with four major sections devoted to cartography, uncharted territory, nostalgia, and souvenirs. Our contributors' words are enhanced by outstanding photography and custom illustrations. Here are just a few of our gorgeous spreads: 



Over the next year, you can look forward to the second print edition of Equals and essay compilations from many of our online contributors.

Our Contributors 
Below are just a handful of the incredible writers whose work will be featured in our pages: 
Melanie Biehle is a Creative Marketing Strategist, Storyteller, and Cool Things Sharer. She’s the founder of Inward Facing Girl, where she documents her obsessions with creativity and psychology, contemporary art, design, photography, travel, magazines, and life in Seattle with The Adventure Club (aka, her husband and son). She optioned a romantic comedy screenplay in 2005, and her writing, graphic design, and photography have been featured on The Huffington Post, Sunset Magazine, Decor8, SF Girl by Bay, UPPERCASE and more.
Erin Boyle is a freelance writer and photographer in Brooklyn, New York. She writes Reading My Tea Leaves, a daily lifestyle blog chronicling life in a tiny apartment and other adventures related to living simply and sustainably.
Erin Loechner, a writer and former ad agency copywriter in Los Angeles, now resides in a sleepy Midwestern town with her husband Ken, daughter Bee and two dogs. A pioneer “design blogger” featuring trending products and lifestyle images, Loechner recently shifted her focus to a more personal quest for creativity on her award-winning site, Design for Mankind, listed as one of The London Time’s top 50 design blogs in the world. Loechner is a freelance writer for various web publications and magazines whose work has been featured in Glamour, Lucky, Dwell, Readymade, Nylon, Print Magazine and The Huffington Post.
Karey Mackin is a writer who would much rather be an artist, but is slowly coming to the realization that her best pictures are drawn with her words. It changed her life when she read that we all walk past a thousand stories every day, and that the best writers among us see about six. At last count, she's up to three.

<div>My name is Lauren White, I was originally from England near London and I now live in Utah with my 3 children and my husband.<br/><p>I have always loved books, I love to curl up with a good book and loose my self in an imaginary world.  One day I thought of how wonderful it would be to have the opportunity to bring to life the imaginary world of Ava, the Elf.  I have been writing for years and now it is time to share the love that I have for writing with the world.</p>
<p><br/><strong>About this book</strong></p>
<p>In the early spring of 2009, in a small town called Ogmore-by-sea in the Vale of Glamorgan Wales, there lived a 16-year-old girl by the name of Ava Deanull. Ava was fine with the idea of being invisible to everyone around her. She enjoyed being with her father, and listening to his stories about Elves, from long ago, and the battles they fought against one corrupt Elf named Blagnor. All Ava needed in life was her father Glen, and her best friend Jack.<br/><br/> All was good, until one day when her life was thrown off balance. Ava’s father had suddenly disappeared, leaving items, such as a mirror that has messages left on it from him to help her deal with her family secret, Ava is half Elf.  Now Ava will have the huge challenge of hiding what she really is, as she tries to hide her new ears as well as her powers that begin to reveal themselves, in more ways than one.<br/><br/> With the help of her best friend Jack, a keeper called Samuel and other interesting characters, Ava must learn how to control her new powers in order to help her father defeat Blagnor and his creatures called Tralons, who have broken free from the prison where they have been captive in for thousands of years.</p>

<h3>What does it take to publish and promote a new book these days?</h3>
<p>Printing and distributing books are the barest beginnings of what it takes to launch a new title in today's rapidly evolving world of publishing. Now the focus has shifted to a far broader scope: the added potential of a vibrant new world of e-books and audio books; Facebook and YouTube; websites and interactive blogs; teleseminars and social media. It's a technological publishing environment filled with promise and exciting new possibilities for reaching a worldwide audience with a life-changing message like the teachings of Oneness; an unprecedented opportunity for reaching more people, building links and creating community! At the same time, the new opportunities for spreading the word have created a need for technical support with the specialized know-how it now takes to bring a new book to life!  Now as Lauren prepares to launch <em>""The Light of Silenddin""</em> in today's totally transformed publishing environment, and reach out to a vast, rapidly expanding audience, she realizes that she can't do it alone anymore. To give ""The Light of Silenddin"" the outreach and momentum that's now possible, she’s going to need help. Naturally, she thought of you ... and hopes you'll be open to supporting the launch of this amazing new book!</p>

After almost 2 years, 30 cities, and 12,000 photos later, I find myself with a wealth of information after living some of my life in China and Taiwan, and have stories and experiences nearly exploding out of me.   Some are exciting.  Some are shocking.  Some are downright bizzare.  Some are just plain confusing.  It's long overdue to collect my thoughts in a meaningful way and try to unravel the mystery of this fascinating part of the world.  For a sample story, see below! </div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding for this project will assist me in many ways.  As I expect this to be the highest quality production possible, I will need advanced professional editing tools for images and writing.  I will also need minimal support to dedicate the time (which I expect to be several months) to collect these stories and edit them.  Several are already written, and several will need to be constructed from journal entries, discussions with fellow travelers, and photographs. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
China is still a question mark for most Americans.  Our knowledge is generally limited to the Great Wall, Terracotta Warriors, Beijing, Shanghai, Communism, and pollution.  But in reality, it is so much more.  If you want to whet your tongue, see the sample story below. Despite the mystery of China, it has become a major world player, and is extraordinarily linked to the United States.  This project promises to be a fascinating read for those who are interested in a drastically different culture trying to figure out who it is in the face of massive development, political controversy, technological explosion.  This will be especially interesting to those who intend to visit or do business with China, as the interaction with people and the usefulness of relationship building are distinctly different, and provide much of the basis for these stories.</div>

<h3>Sample Story</h3>
<p>The following is a story I wrote during my time as a teacher at a major Chinese university.  If you like what you read, please consider donating or sharing this campaign with others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>It's 6:00 AM.  I wake up in my bed to the sound of piercing Chinese voices: ""YI! ER! SAN! SI!"" which means ""ONE! TWO! THREE! FOUR!""  It's the sound of my students beginning their day.  A whistle has woken them up at 5:30 and now they are running in formation around campus, a route which takes them close to the ""foreign expert hotel"" where I live.  They don't always wake me up, but today, between their yelling, the cold weather defeating my outdated heating, and the sun filtering through the yellow and grey air, I crawl out from under the mosquito net that I sleep beneath, get up and make myself a cup of tea.  I walk across my apartment, which was built and furnished in the 1950s, past my bathroom with its hastily taped shower head and a line of bricks cemented to the floor to serve as the shower area.</em></p>
<p><em>My students begin their day at 5:30 to the sound of a whistle.  They run from 6AM to 7AM and then eat breakfast.  At 7:30 they are sitting in their classroom.  Classes don't start until 8:00, but their ominous ""captain"" who I have never met but apparently controls every aspect of their day insists they study for a half hour before their first class. </em></p>
<p><em>Of course, he is not in the room with then, and instead, the students start up the classroom computer and watch movies, listen to music, or look at reruns of American basketball games.  Sleeping is popular too; when I enter the room for an 8AM class, I'm usually greeted by 10 or 20 tops of the heads of my students. </em></p>
<p><em>But the truth is, once I enter and start class, the students are genuinely happy to see me, and I'm happy to see them.  Teaching here is such a unique and interesting experience because it is such a crash of cultures, styles, and every class is fun for me.  The students enjoy it as well.  My class is the token ""easy class"" because their other teachers work them so hard and the atmosphere is so cold and pressuring, but actually most of the students work quite hard in my class.  The idea that learning can be fun had never occurred to my students.  We played ""Simon Says"" which I think is great for listening comprehension and vocabulary building.  The students had so much fun that now they ask me to play it, and when I tell them it's helped improve their English, they're shocked when they realize it's true. </em></p>
<p><em>The students are in class nonstop from 8:00AM to 8:15PM with a break for lunch and dinner.  8:15PM to 9:30PM is their only free time (this schedule applies to the weekends, too) and at 9:30PM they are locked down in their dormitories.  For 30 minutes, they are allowed to brush their teeth, wash their clothes, fetch hot water for their showers (during this time I often seen them walking through campus with big plastic buckets of hot water with which to bathe) or study.  At exactly 10PM, all electricity to the building is cut off, and the students can do nothing but use the remaining battery on their cell phones to text each other or make calls, or chat with me online.  They don't even have alarm clocks, which is why they wake up each morning to a whistle.</em></p>
<p><em>There is also on-campus dining. I live in north campus, which is the oldest part of campus, and the food is honestly not great.  Everything is a la carte, and none of the dishware is ever truly clean, and you have to take your tray and dump it onto a mountain of food refuse when you're finished.  The whole process is extremely unappetizing.  There is, however, a dining hall just for teachers, and when I go there the environment is the same but the food is a bit better.  Sharing the teachers' dining hall is a restaurant that I occasionally eat at, and the food is quite good.  My favorites are ""boloajipian,"" chunks of chicken and pineapple tossed together in an orange sauce, and ""tie ban niuro,"" strips of beef sizzling on a bed of onion shoots, that arrives at the table on an iron skillet and with steam billowing off of it.  Both of those dishes, by the way, cost less than $3.</em></p>
<p><em>My students have it the worst of all in terms of food.  They have to eat in a special dining hall for all of their meals, and the food is the lowest quality I've eaten in China.  I ate there once, just to walk in their shoes, and I was given a metal tray with an ice cream scoop of rice, a scoop of some vegetable in sauce, and a small chicken patty.   My students said I came on a good day; the chicken patty was a rare treat. There was nothing to drink, and each student gets one tray of food.</em></p>
<p><em>But fortunately, there is salvation!  The Foreign Expert Cafe is quite literally a hole in the wall of the hotel where I live.  It caters almost specifically to the flight students, and even though the restaurant only has about 10 extremely dirty tables, the food is great and cheap, and they sell lots of alcohol and cigarettes.  I love eating there with students; I feel so alive and like such a local.  We huddle on stools around the tiny tables bundled up against the cold, and share steaming plates of various dishes - mushrooms and cabbage, chunks of beef and garlic, and chicken slices with green pepper are among my favorites.  We wash it all down with Qingdao Beer which the Chinese drink at room temperature but I get cold bottles because I'm a regular there and explained that Americans prefer cold beer.  A typical meal there for four people costs about $8. </em></p>
<p><em>The student-teacher relationship is completely different in China. In class, the Chinese teachers stand in front of the board or projector and lecture.  The students do not ask questions because it is a sign that they are defective in learning, and if they don't understand something they just fall behind.  It doesn't help that in the Chinese language the word for ""question"" is exactly the same as ""problem.""  Furthermore, asking questions means the teacher is doing something wrong, and that implication is unacceptable here.  So you can imagine the students’ reactions when on the first day I sat down on top of the desk in the front row and every so often asked them ""Do you guys have questions? How can I help you understand this better?"" </em></p>
<p><em>When I call on them, they immediately stand up and report their answer.  And if they don’t know the answer, they look like they’re about to cry and say, “Teacher, I’m so sorry.”  I keep trying to explain to them that the purpose of being in school is to LEARN and that if they don’t know something, that’s perfectly OK!</em></p>
<p><em>Last week I saw a group of students at the aforementioned cheap and delicious restaurant.  They were toasting constantly and had about 20 empty bottles of Tsingtao beer on their table.  The toasted, and after downing his glass, one of the students promptly vomited all over the table.  The restaurant employees did nothing; they didn't even give him some napkins.  But despite some obvious differences, through my students I can see that in some ways people are all the same: they love to laugh, and they're interested about life and the world.</em></p>

Mi smo tri prijateljice: Amila Hrustić Batovanja, Hatidža Gušić i Masha Durkalić. Priču #ŽeneBiH započele smo spontano u martu 2018. godine, nakon razgovora u zajedničkom <i>chat</i>u na <i>Facebook</i>u. U tom momentu nalazile smo se na tri različite lokacije u svijetu (Prag–Sarajevo–Reykjavik); grupni <i>chat</i> nam je bio način da ostanemo u kontaktu.</p><p>Tokom jednog od naših razgovora (bio je 1. mart 2018. godine), pričale smo o tome na koje se sve načine obilježavaju 8. mart i Mjesec ženske historije (#WomensHistoryMonth) i skreće pažnja na borbu za rodnu ravnopravnost.  Razgovarajući o tome kako društvo slavi žene koje su doprinijele ovoj borbi, shvatile smo da se o izuzetnim ženama iz BiH vrlo malo govori. Željele smo napraviti nešto da to promijenimo, i pala nam je na pamet ideja da svakog dana marta, na našim ličnim profilima na društvenim mrežama, dijelimo po jedan vizual 30 žena iz BiH, sa pratećim mini biografijama – u nadi da će te priče doći do što više ljudi. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535986283/a8qajjiaqi8dmvemtdj2.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Već narednog dana, 2. marta, na društvenim mrežama objavile smo prvi vizual sa kratkom biografijom Stake Skenderove, prve učiteljice i socijalne radnice u BiH. Za ovu malu kampanju izabrale smo žene koje su bile pionirke u svojim oblastima djelovanja, koje su se zalagale za emancipaciju i rodnu ravnopravnost, te koje su i nama bile inspirativne ličnosti. Ljudi su vrlo brzo počeli dijeliti ove sadržaje, te nam predlagati i druge žene o kojima bismo mogle pisati. Uskoro su se sa upitima počeli javljati i mediji, i priča se proširila dalje od naših privatnih profila na društvenim mrežama.</p><p>Reakcije na društvenim mrežama bile su mnogobrojne, pozitivne i ohrabrujuće. Vidjele smo da ljudi žele znati više o ovim ženama, kao i o mnogim drugim. No, mart se brzo završio, a mi smo shvatile da mjesec dana nije dovoljno da priče ovih značajnih žena ispričamo na opsežniji način.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535987596/dbxg7v4zbzntrfvjd9jx.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Ohrabrene vašim reakcijama i prijedlozima, projekt smo odlučile proširiti u knjigu #ŽeneBiH – i zato vi ovo sada i čitate.

Each woman was illustrated by a different woman illustrator/designer/artist from BiH. This is a book about first female artists, writers, poets,  social workers, national heroines, directors, scientists, musicians, doctors, activists, professors, deans, pilots and even soccer referees.</i></p><p>Greetings to all! We are three friends: Amila Hrustić Batovanja, Hatidža Gušić and Masha Durkalić. We began #ŽeneBiH story spontaneously in March 2018, after a group chat on Facebook. In that moment we were on three different locations in the world (Prague – Sarajevo – Reykjavik) and this group chat was our way of staying in touch.</p><p>During one of our conversations (it was March 1, 2018), we have discussed the ways #WomensHistoryMonth was being celebrated in terms of gender equality around the world. During this conversation, we have realized that in our home country women’s achievements and their strength are rarely, almost never on the public agenda. We wanted to start changing that for at least a month, and we decided to make our own social media campaign by sharing visuals with photos and biographies of remarkable BiH women, posting a story on a different woman each day, hoping that the stories will reach at least our friends and followers. The following day (March 2, 2018) we have posted our first visual with a short biography and photo of Staka Skenderova, the first teacher and social worker from BiH.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536092093/avrqu05f6avmryg4ism9.png"" src=""""/></p><p>For this social media campaign, we have chosen women who were pioneers in their fields, who have advocated emancipation and gender equality, and who were an inspiration to us. Soon after the first visual was posted, people have started sharing it on their own profiles, and suggesting other remarkable women, the media followed, and the story went on beyond our personal social media profiles.</p><p>The positive reactions on social media were overwhelming, people were supportive and encouraged us to continue with our work. After the last visual was posted we came to realization that one month is not enough to celebrate all the women’s accomplishments and we wanted to continue sharing stories about these and more amazing women.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536092184/xyjrxbmnjo5ylyng45dq.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Encouraged by your reactions and suggestions, we have decided to expand this project into a book #ŽeneBiH and this is the reason you are now reading these lines.

Mi smo tri prijateljice: Amila Hrustić Batovanja, Hatidža Gušić i Masha Durkalić. Priču #ŽeneBiH započele smo spontano u martu 2018. godine, nakon razgovora u zajedničkom chatu na Facebooku. U tom momentu nalazile smo se na tri različite lokacije u svijetu (Prag–Sarajevo–Reykjavik); grupni chat nam je bio način da ostanemo u kontaktu.Tokom jednog od naših razgovora (bio je 1. mart 2018. godine), pričale smo o tome na koje se sve načine obilježavaju 8. mart i Mjesec ženske historije (#WomensHistoryMonth) i skreće pažnja na borbu za rodnu ravnopravnost.  Razgovarajući o tome kako društvo slavi žene koje su doprinijele ovoj borbi, shvatile smo da se o izuzetnim ženama iz BiH vrlo malo govori. Željele smo napraviti nešto da to promijenimo, i pala nam je na pamet ideja da svakog dana marta, na našim ličnim profilima na društvenim mrežama, dijelimo po jedan vizual 30 žena iz BiH, sa pratećim mini biografijama – u nadi da će te priče doći do što više ljudi. Već narednog dana, 2. marta, na društvenim mrežama objavile smo prvi vizual sa kratkom biografijom Stake Skenderove, prve učiteljice i socijalne radnice u BiH. Za ovu malu kampanju izabrale smo žene koje su bile pionirke u svojim oblastima djelovanja, koje su se zalagale za emancipaciju i rodnu ravnopravnost, te koje su i nama bile inspirativne ličnosti. Ljudi su vrlo brzo počeli dijeliti ove sadržaje, te nam predlagati i druge žene o kojima bismo mogle pisati. Uskoro su se sa upitima počeli javljati i mediji, i priča se proširila dalje od naših privatnih profila na društvenim mrežama.Reakcije na društvenim mrežama bile su mnogobrojne, pozitivne i ohrabrujuće. Vidjele smo da ljudi žele znati više o ovim ženama, kao i o mnogim drugim. No, mart se brzo završio, a mi smo shvatile da mjesec dana nije dovoljno da priče ovih značajnih žena ispričamo na opsežniji način.Ohrabrene vašim reakcijama i prijedlozima, projekt smo odlučile proširiti u knjigu #ŽeneBiH – i zato vi ovo sada i čitate. Zamislile smo da knjiga bude zbirka biografija više od 50 žena koje su kroz historiju naše zemlje razbijale stereotipe, unapređivale prava žena, zalagale se za emancipaciju i bile prve u onome što su radile. U priču smo potom uključile i 50 bh. umjetnica, dizajnerica i/ili ilustratorica koje su napravile njihove portrete.Knjiga #ŽeneBiH je spoj onoga čime se svaka od nas individualno bavi i onoga što nas kao prijateljice veže. Amila je magistrica produkt dizajna i više od sedam godina radi kao art direktorica u oblasti oglašavanja. Hatidža je diplomirana ekonomistica i projekt menadžerica sa dugogodišnjim iskustvom na različitim aktivističkim i feminističkim projektima. Masha je diplomirana novinarka i aktivistkinja koja se godinama bavi pisanjem i istraživanjem o ženama, ženskim pravima i ženskim pokretima. Ono što nas povezuje u ovom projektu su feminizam i principi solidarnosti i ravnopravnosti, prema kojima nastojimo živjeti i djelovati.U vrijeme kada je ova ideja nastajala i dalje smo sve tri bile na različitim lokacijama u svijetu. Balansirajući vlastite rasporede i obaveze, svakodnevno smo komunicirale, istraživale, pisale, skicirale i dogovarale svaki detalj ove knjige.Žene koje su mijenjale historiju BiH svakodnevno padaju u zaborav. Svjedočimo tome da je njihova imena nemoguće pronaći u školskim udžbenicima. Dokazi o njihovom postojanju gube se u savremenoj kulturi, a po njima su rijetko nazvani gradski trgovi, škole ili ulice. Mi želimo ispričati njihove priče, pokazati njihova lica i prisjetiti se njihovih postiguća. Podrškom knjizi #ŽeneBiH doprinosite oživljavanju naslijeđa ovih žena, kao i povećanju njihove vidljivosti.Naš angažman na ovoj knjizi je u potpunosti volonterski, ali za izdavanje ove knjige potrebna su nam finansijska sredstva. Raduje nas što smo već uspjele prikupiti 49% sredstava za knjigu, zahvaljujući ličnim finansijskim investicijama pojedinaca i pojedinki, kao i podrškom sponzora/ica. Ovom kampanjom želimo prikupiti preostalih 51% finansijskih sredstava, kako bismo obezbijedile honorare za ilustratorice, lektoricu i ostale saradnice.Potrudile smo se da ono što nudimo odgovara realnim cijenama, i da svako pronađe ponešto za sebe ili svoje prijatelje/ice, članove/ice porodice i kolege/ice.Želimo izdati najmanje 500 primjeraka ove knjige, stoga jezgru ponude čini upravo knjiga #ŽeneBiH. Naš cilj je da se ova knjiga nađe u vašim domovima i javnim bibliotekama, te da vam približi fascinantne žene zbog kojih smo sve ovo i započele.Što više donirate – mi vas više darujemo, pa tako u u kombinaciji sa knjigom nudimo i naljepnice, bedževe i torbe. Uz to imamo i specijalne ponude u ograničenoj količini – broševe sa minijaturnim portretima deset žena iz knjige, koje je izradila umjetnica Selma Mahmutović, te društvenu igricu Strašne žene. Tu su i posebne prednosti za one koji budu htjeli imati personalizirano izdanje knjige, a tokom kampanje predstavit ćemo i nove ponude.Vjerujemo da ćete nam pomoći da postignemo naš postavljeni cilj i izdamo knjigu #ŽeneBiH.Ovu inicijativu započele smo želeći da napravimo doprinos vidljivosti žena BiH i da ohrabrimo slične edukativne inicijative. Uložile smo svoje vrijeme, trud, talente i emocije. Uspjele smo doći ovako daleko samo zahvaljujući svakodnevnom angažmanu, predanosti i vjeri u ovu ideju. Ispred nas je još mnogo istraživanja i rada kako bismo knjigu finalizirale do planiranog roka.Ova knjiga slavi žene koje su odlučile da se školuju onda kada to ženama nije bilo dozvoljeno, koje su bile (i jesu) ambasadorice bh. umjetnosti i kulture u svijetu; koje su se zalagale za ženska prava u vrijeme kada ona uopće nisu postojala; koje su položile svoje živote za borbu protiv fašizma; koje su postigle svjetske uspjehe u poljima svog djelovanja i koje su bile ili jesu jedno od najvećih blaga koje BiH ima.Podržavajući izdavanje knjige #ŽeneBiH na bilo koji od izabranih načina, pomoći ćete nam da proširimo znanje o ovim ženama, kako bi njihova imena i njihovo naslijeđe postali poznati svima, te ćete doprinijeti očuvanju i oživljavanju ženske historije koja je nepravedno zapostavljena. Konačno, svojim doprinosom realizaciji knjige #ŽeneBiH omogućavate da buduće generacije djevojčica i dječaka budu upoznate sa naslijeđem ovih izuzetnih žena, koje su svojim radom i zalaganjem zadužile sve nas.Od početka smo znale da ćemo se suočiti sa brojnim poteškoćama, jer nismo imale nikakav unaprijed obezbijeđen budžet, niti ikakvu sigurnost da će knjiga koju pravimo ikada ugledati svjetlo dana. Susrele smo se sa raznim pitanjima i komentarima, kojima su ljudi propitivali to da li smo sigurne da mi ovo možemo. Da – sigurne smo da mi ovo možemo, zato što želimo. Bez obzira na ishod kampanje, mi ćemo pronaći način da knjigu objavimo.Uprkos tome što smo u realizaciju projekta uložile vlastito vrijeme, i pored radnih obaveza i ostalih životnih okolnosti, uspjele smo kreirati inicijativu baziranu na solidarnosti i suradnji koja je okupila ljude iz BiH, ali i šire. Ono što nam je pomoglo da istrajemo bila je kontinuirana podrška brojnih ljudi koji su nam se javljali, nudili nam svoju pomoć i motivirali nas da nastavimo.Potrudile smo se da rizike minimiziramo koliko god je moguće, stoga putem ove kampanje prikupljamo pola iznosa potrebnog za izdavanje knjige. Ipak, ne možemo biti potpuno sigurne da će kampanja biti uspješna, ali vjerujemo da možemo računati na vašu podršku koju smo imale i do sada.Razumijemo da nisu svi/e u situaciji da finansijski doprinesu realizaciji ove knjige. #ŽeneBiH možete podržati i na druge načine:
proslijedite ovu kampanju prijateljima/cama i poznanicima/ama putem e-maila;

 Pomozite nam da ove žene učinimo dijelom historije kojoj one ravnopravno pripadaju!Ukoliko imate pitanja u vezi knjige #ŽeneBiH, kontaktirajte nas na info@zenebih.ba Overview: The book #ŽeneBiH is an artistic, activist and research initiative that is comprised of biographies of over 50 BiH women who have broken stereotypes and advocated women’s rights and emancipation. Each woman was illustrated by a different woman illustrator/designer/artist from BiH. This is a book about first female artists, writers, poets,  social workers, national heroines, directors, scientists, musicians, doctors, activists, professors, deans, pilots and even soccer referees.Greetings to all! We are three friends: Amila Hrustić Batovanja, Hatidža Gušić and Masha Durkalić. We began #ŽeneBiH story spontaneously in March 2018, after a group chat on Facebook. In that moment we were on three different locations in the world (Prague – Sarajevo – Reykjavik) and this group chat was our way of staying in touch.During one of our conversations (it was March 1, 2018), we have discussed the ways #WomensHistoryMonth was being celebrated in terms of gender equality around the world. During this conversation, we have realized that in our home country women’s achievements and their strength are rarely, almost never on the public agenda. We wanted to start changing that for at least a month, and we decided to make our own social media campaign by sharing visuals with photos and biographies of remarkable BiH women, posting a story on a different woman each day, hoping that the stories will reach at least our friends and followers. The following day (March 2, 2018) we have posted our first visual with a short biography and photo of Staka Skenderova, the first teacher and social worker from BiH.For this social media campaign, we have chosen women who were pioneers in their fields, who have advocated emancipation and gender equality, and who were an inspiration to us. Soon after the first visual was posted, people have started sharing it on their own profiles, and suggesting other remarkable women, the media followed, and the story went on beyond our personal social media profiles.The positive reactions on social media were overwhelming, people were supportive and encouraged us to continue with our work. After the last visual was posted we came to realization that one month is not enough to celebrate all the women’s accomplishments and we wanted to continue sharing stories about these and more amazing women.Encouraged by your reactions and suggestions, we have decided to expand this project into a book #ŽeneBiH and this is the reason you are now reading these lines. Our vision is that this book should be a collection of biographies of over 50 women who have broken stereotypes, advocated gender equality and emancipation, and were pioneers in their field of work. We have included 50 female BiH artists, designers and/or illustrators who have made unique portraits of these remarkable women.The book #ŽeneBiH is a combination of our individual professional backgrounds and our friendship. Amila has a master’s degree in product design, and more than seven years of experience as an art director in advertising. Hatidža is an economist and a project manager with a feminist background leading projects on women’s empowerment. Masha is a journalist, researcher and an activist who has been writing and researching in the field of women’s human rights, women empowerment and feminist movements. The bond that binds us is feminism and principles of solidarity and equality we honor and live by.In the time of the conception of this idea we were at three different locations in the world. By balancing our own schedules and responsibilities, we have communicated daily with each other, researched, wrote, drafted and visualized each detail of this book.Women who have changed and shaped the history of BiH are being forgotten. We bear witness to them falling into oblivion and being erased from textbooks. The evidence of their existence is lost in modern culture, and we can rarely see a street, city square or a building named after one of them. We want to tell their stories, show their faces and honor their achievements. By supporting #ŽeneBiH you are contributing to the revival and visibility of their achievements.Our work on this book is entirely voluntary, but we need funds in order to publish the book itself. We are pleased to have already secured 49% of the funds required for the book, thanks to individual personal donations, as well as the support of our sponsors. This campaign aims to collect the remaining 51% of the needed funds, in order to secure the fees for the illustrators, the proofreader, and other associates.We made sure that our perks correspond to actual prices, and that everybody can find something for themselves, or their friends, family, and colleagues.We wish to print at least 500 copies of this book, which means that the core perk is the #ŽeneBiH book itself. Our goal is that this book finds its place in your homes and public libraries, and to help you get to know the remarkable women who inspired us to embark on this journey.The more you donate - the more we give in return, so the perks are a combination of the book and stickers, buttons, or tote bags. We also have a limited special offer - brooches with miniature portraits of ten women featured in the book created by artist Selma Mahmutović, as well as the Fierce Women card game. There are special perks for those of you who would like to own a personalized copy of the book, and we will be introducing even more perks during the campaign.We believe that you will help us achieve our goal and make our dream of publishing this book come true.We started this initiative wishing to contribute to the visibility of women in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to encourage similar educational initiatives. We have invested our time, effort, talents, and emotions. We have made it this far thanks to everyday engagement, commitment, and our faith in this idea. We still have a lot of research and work ahead of us in order to finalize the book by the set deadline.This book celebrates women who decided to pursue education even when women were not allowed to do so, who were (and are) ambassadors of BiH art and culture in the world, the women who promoted women’s rights at a time when they did not even exist, women who gave their lives in the fight against fascism, women who have achieved worldwide fame in their respective fields of work, and those who were or are one of the greatest treasures of BiH.By supporting the publication of the book #ŽeneBiH in any way, you will help us spread the knowledge about these women, in order to make their names, accomplishments and heritage known to all, and contribute to the preservation and invigoration of the unjustly disregarded female history. Finally, with your contribution to making the book #ŽeneBiH possible, you are making sure that future generations of girls and boys will get to know the names and accomplishments of these extraordinary women, whose work and commitment indebted all of us.Ever since the beginning, we knew that we will face numerous challenges, since we had no previously secured budget, or any certainty that the book we were creating will ever see the light of day. We encountered many inquiries and comments from people questioning whether we were sure we could do this. Yes - we are sure we can do this, because we want to. Regardless of the campaign’s outcome, we will find a way to publish the book.Despite investing our own time in this project, even with our own work and personal commitments, we have succeeded in creating an initiative based on solidarity and cooperation that has brought together people from Bosnia and Herzegovina, and beyond. What kept us going was the continued support of many people who have contacted us, offered to help, and motivated us to carry on.We made sure to minimize the risks as much as possible, so this campaign aims to gather half of the funds required to publish the book. However, we cannot be completely sure that the campaign will be successful, but we are counting on your support that we have had so far.We are aware that not everyone can financially contribute to this project. You can also support #ŽeneBiH in other ways:
email the news about this campaign to your friends and acquaintances
share the campaign on your social media profiles
follow #ŽeneBiH on  Facebook Twitter Instagram

Help us make these women a part of history they rightfully belong to!If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at info@zenebih.ba",38.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>The Beautiful Math of Coral </i>is a coming-of-age story set in college about STEM, Art, and all the intangible things in between.<br/><br/>My name is E. Ozie and I am the author of<i> The Beautiful Math of Coral</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to talk about STEM and Art through storytelling. I wanted to write a story about things you don’t usually see in a fictional sense.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the beauty of mathematics, science, and art. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn alongside Coral and Fernando about the importance of love, friendship, and what that could mean for STEM and Art.</p>
<h3>The Beautiful Math of Coral: A Novel</h3>
<p>Coral: She hates art. She hates it so much. Who would have thought in a Nigerian-American household your parents prioritize the arts over the sciences? She just wants to go to college to escape all of that.<br/><br/>Fernando: He used to like astronomy, but now he doesn’t. He liked architecture, but now he doesn’t. He wants to study computer engineering, but should he? He questions what he wants to do in the future and his parents want him to succeed. He has some dreams that he wants to reach no matter how crazy people think he is.<br/><br/>Coral welcomes us into her world full of colors that she wants to leave. She doesn’t want to revisit the past, the past that was art. Fernando had aspirations to be an architect, but that all fell through when he got to college.<br/><br/>Coral is ready to explore everything in STEM but is unaware of everything. Fernando wants to get a degree in engineering but questions his reasons.<br/><br/>Fernando is different from Coral in many ways, but somehow they found each other. Together, they try to find their place in the world and their place in STEM.<br/><br/>This is a powerful story about a young girl grappling with first love, college, engineering, identity, and all the other intangible things in between. It’s about discovering the unfamiliar and looking into the unknown with someone else because those are the moments that surround us and make us who we are.<br/><br/>So, who were you before you saw the beauty in the unfamiliar things? No, who were you really?<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are a fan of <i>Chemistry</i> by Weike Wang or<i>The Sun is Also a Star</i> by Nicola Yoon. You will also love this if you find science, engineering, mathematics, or art fascinating and want to learn more about them.<br/><br/><i>The Beautiful Math of Coral </i>speaks to young adults and older who want to grapple with STEM and Art in a new way. I look forward to exploring these themes and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing the unconventional beauty in STEM and Art will help us discover beauty in so many other places.</p>

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>Mala &amp; the Mask of Gold is a story about two siblings who embark on a quest to find the elusive Mask of Gold and explore Philippine mythology and folklore along the way.<br/><br/>My name is Jaime Martin Ko and I am the author of Mala &amp; the Mask of Gold. I wrote this story because of the diversity gap in U.S. literature that lacks fictional stories of LGBTQ+ and Filipinx identity. Reading queer literature and stories from authors like James Baldwin, Leslie Feinberg, and Audre Lorde helped me to learn about gender identity and sexual orientation today. Books like Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson series also gave me the power of accepting my flaws as gifts. I knew I wanted to tell a story like these powerful authors who made a huge impact in my life and personal development. My culture and identity is my power and I wanted to add a fantasy and Filipinx touch to create a positive impact on folks who read my book.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that you can be a hero of your own story, if you choose to be. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with LGBTQ+ themes, escape from mundane realities of life into a world of Filipinx folklore, learn alongside Salem and Mala about the importance of sibling-hood and finding power from within. I also want to encourage you, the reader, to become the author of your own story one day — a story that I would love to be a fan of too!<br/><br/>Magic exists in this story of fiction. We explore the rich past of the pre-colonial Philippines before it was even known as such. In this story, we know it as the Old World. The Old World begins with the creation of the early archipelago and the birth of a diverse group of cultures that was home to numerous kingdoms, sultanates, and tribes. The cultures in this world were The Old Tagalogs, The Old Visayans, and The Old Bikolanos, just to name a few. The different cultures worshiped the Ancient Deities, and with the help of spirit friends — abyans, they called them — Babaylans (shamans) worked with the spirit world to bring peace and healing to the communities and their respective people.<br/><br/>Shamans played an important role in the community and materialized in many different forms across the islands. Each Babaylan’s source of magic was unique to themselves and dependent on their inherent talent, their region, the needs from community, and their relationship with specific abyans. From the art of healing through mixing potions and natural herbs to having the rare abilities of sorcery, Shamans evoked the old Philippine mythos and strongly tied the physical and spiritual realm.<br/><br/>The conquest of the islands by the hands of the Blood Moon Empire did not begin until several centuries later with the birth of the first Lunar Eclipse as the catalyst for the invasions. With each Lunar Eclipse Invasion becoming more devastating than the last, the Blood Moon has become an omen of doom for the Old World’s inhabitants. As the indigenous kingdoms fight against the Blood Moon Warriors to expand and empower their people, all hope remains lost. And without hope and belief, the power of the ancient Deities grow weaker with each passing Lunar Eclipse. The destined champions of the Deities must find these sacred artifacts to help restore the hope of the people and balance of the world.<br/><br/>Our story begins with Mala and Salem, two siblings who are products of the Old World and the Blood Moon Empire. The heroes begin this journey to find a sacred artifact known as the Mask of Gold. The two endure a quest of hope — the hope for a new life, the hope to love oneself and their differences, and the hope to restore the Old World to its beauty and power — or rather, create a better world born from the ambiguity of the adventure.<br/><br/><strong>You will love this book...</strong><ul>
<li>if you are into fantasy-adventure reads.</li>
<li>if you’re a teenager or young adult. The main characters are in their adolescent years — Mala is 16 and Salem is 18.</li>
<li>if you’re a fan of stories like Castlevania, Atlantis: The Lost Empire, the Percy Jackson Series, or The Poppy War.</li>
</ul>Mala &amp; the Mask of Gold speaks to young adults and those in the LGBTQ+ community who want to grapple with identity and culture in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Mala &amp; the Mask of Gold inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>How can our own differences and insecurities be our powerful advantages?</li>
<li>Why are siblinghood and family both powerful yet frightening?</li>
<li>Why are magic and culture intertwined in reality and in fantasy?</li>
</ul> I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing LGBTQ+ themes in mythology, Siblinghood and Family, and Coming of Age and Sense of Self will change us all for the better.<br/> <p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <p>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December 2020.</p>

When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hard cover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish an audiobook. <strong>I plan to donate 20% of my sales to 2 non profits (10% for each one)</strong><br/><br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<p>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish</p>

<p>And more...</p> <p><strong>About the Author</strong></p> Jaime Martin Ko is a Filipinx immigrant, first-generation, and genderfluid college graduate from the University of Maryland where they studied Supply Chain Management, Marketing, and LGBT Studies. Jaime is a vocal advocate for the LGBTQ+ community and was awarded the Lorde-O'Leary award for their work at their university, tackling initiatives like implementing All-Gender restrooms, advocating for inclusive healthcare practices for Trans/Non-binary students, and speaking at panels educating students on LGBTQ+ terminology and issues. Outside of work, Jaime is a part of a variety of organizations like Anakbayan DC.<br/><br/>They wrote this book because it is important to them to show others the beauty of this world. They want to also have fun with the magic and the myths/folklore of the Philippines. As a Filipinx immigrant, Jaime grew up surrounded by influences from different faiths/cultures but never an integration of those stories being told from their homeland. Jaime wants to change that for other Filipinx youth!<br/><br/>They wanted to use this book as a platform for their creativity. Jaime knew that they would regret it in 10 years if they didn’t try to at least own their story and create this adventure that could benefit a lot of people within many different communities and those who are struggling with celebrating their differences.<br/><br/>Outside of this book, they are just Jaime. An immigrant from Zamboanga City, PH who loves makeup, fashion/styling, and advocating for minority communities.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Jaime at Jaime91697@gmail.com and @JaimeKoAuthor on Facebook and Instagram.<p> </p>

The two endure a quest of hope — the hope for a new life, the hope to love oneself and their differences, and the hope to restore the Old World to its beauty and power — or rather, create a better world born from the ambiguity of the adventure.You will love this book...
if you are into fantasy-adventure reads.
if you’re a teenager or young adult. The main characters are in their adolescent years — Mala is 16 and Salem is 18.
if you’re a fan of stories like Castlevania, Atlantis: The Lost Empire, the Percy Jackson Series, or The Poppy War.
Mala & the Mask of Gold speaks to young adults and those in the LGBTQ+ community who want to grapple with identity and culture in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that Mala & the Mask of Gold inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:
How can our own differences and insecurities be our powerful advantages?
Why are siblinghood and family both powerful yet frightening?
Why are magic and culture intertwined in reality and in fantasy?
 I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing LGBTQ+ themes in mythology, Siblinghood and Family, and Coming of Age and Sense of Self will change us all for the better. What I Need & What You'll Get This book will be published with New Degree Press.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

Here are some other ways to help if you can:Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #MagicExistsInMe and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press so we can help amplify your efforts.
You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page

<h3>What is the book about?</h3>""Letters To My Papa"" is a personal story comprising daily letters from a daughter to her father, ensuring that despite sustaining a major brain injury, he'd never miss a day. I'd account for it all and tell him his own unbelievable tale.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p><br/>The book begins as I tell my father how he just cheated death. With my ""Papa Bear"" in a coma, I wrote to him when I couldn’t talk to him. I kept the faith that one day he’d wake up and be able to read my words. He did awake, and the words kept coming. So I wrote to him all through his recovery, encouraging his progress, cheering him on, and keeping tabs on the little day-to-day things that his slowly recovering short-term memory struggled to keep up with.</p>
<p><br/>When his recovery took a sudden downturn, I wrote some more, holding out hope for a miracle that never came. With a broken heart surprisingly filled with gratitude, I continued writing through my grief. Those letters provide an intimate account of the grieving process one day at a time.</p>
<p><br/>I invite you to read along as I journey through seasons of hope, joy, fear, sorrow, and most of all, love.</p>

I kept the faith that one day he’d wake up and be able to read my words. He did awake, and the words kept coming. So I wrote to him all through his recovery, encouraging his progress, cheering him on, and keeping tabs on the little day-to-day things that his slowly recovering short-term memory struggled to keep up with.
When his recovery took a sudden downturn, I wrote some more, holding out hope for a miracle that never came. With a broken heart surprisingly filled with gratitude, I continued writing through my grief. Those letters provide an intimate account of the grieving process one day at a time.
I invite you to read along as I journey through seasons of hope, joy, fear, sorrow, and most of all, love.




Who is the book for?
For the past 2 years, this has been MY story - one that I've shared with my family, my friends, and my colleagues - but maybe it's YOUR story too!
There may be perfect strangers out there who need to read it. Perfect strangers who will find the slightest comfort in knowing they're not alone. Perfect strangers who will find the simplest inspiration in my journey. This book is for them too.

    Risks & Challenges
The biggest obstacle on my way to publishing is time. I have tried to estimate a reasonable deadline, aiming to place my print order in June 2015 and deliver perks to my backers by the end of the summer. However, in the event that I am unable to complete this project in that time frame, my backers will be the first to know. I will notify you in advance if I think I need some extra time. Throughout the 6 months that follow my campaign, I am committed to sending you updates on my progress so you'll know how everything is coming together each step of the way.

SYNOPSIS OF NOVEL
This
novel is an adventure about a possible scenario of the End Times.  The main character, John Marin, is a
genetic scientist with the goal of discovering the true origins of mankind by
decoding the DNA genomes.  A new
development of energy readings by a machine recently invented gives him a new
set of codes to read.  His previous
military service was breaking codes in the cryptography section of the US
Navy.  His discoveries could lead
to discrediting religion and open the doors to the Anti-Christ to create a
single world religion and government. 
John's research eventually leads to involvement with two groups of
people who are preparing for the Anti-Christ.  John first finds himself involved a group of scientists who
become good friends, in particular, Janice who he falls in love with and Pepe,
whose fate will be coupled with his own. 
The lab is funded by a secret organization that is convinced that Satan
is a god just as powerful as the real God.  They intend to use science to discredit religion and create
a New World order.  At first, John
and some of his fellow scientists, including Pepe and Janice, are not aware
that the research is not for scientific reasons.  As events unfold, John and Janice realizes the evil intent and
eventually leaves the group and joins a small group of spiritual zealots led by
an angel named Paint.  Their reclusive hideout in Europe gives them a sanctuary to
prepare for the fight against the Anti-Christ.  Meantime, world events are unfolding to reveal catastrophes
prophesied in the bible.  John and others becomes involved to the point that they becomes  major characters in the history
of mankind.  They train to fight spiritual warfare unlike anything ever experienced or seen in
history.  Though the
book is fiction, it provides a scenario that might portrait the events that are
suppose to occur in the End Times according to the biblical scriptures.MISSION/VISIONMy mission is to take my novel to a NUMBER ONE BEST SELLER.  Millions of book readers will be reached with advertising in newspapers, television, internet, talk radio, and other venues.MARKETINGFifteen thousand dollars might seem like a lot for a marketing campaign.  My business plan requires promotions that requires investments in advertising to reach millions of book readers.  Book Daily is just one of many venues that I will utilize to reach my audience.  These promotions and advertising can add up.  Book Daily alone cost me $60 to reach 50,000 readers.  An ad in the New York Times Sunday review will cost me several thousand dollars.  I also need a professional editing that will cost several thousand dollars.  $5,000 will be used to pay for perks for contributors.  See marketing campaign below.

who can directly or indirectly interact with others through profiles, journals,
images, videos, and audio. This will increase recognition of my book in major online
communities and establish a network of followers, potential readers, fellow
authors, industry associates and peers with my social media profiles.  Millions of online
users access their own social media profile on a regular basis and actively
look to share with others their common interests. Through the profiles and
memberships, I can connect, interact, and share with my audience news and information regarding myself and my book.  This service
includes the most popular social networks to share my profile and interests,
communities specifically for books and authors, the ability to share online
journals with multimedia content, and services that help distribute my journal updates to all my existing accounts.  These websites are -  WordPress: A popular and user friendly

Hi, I’m josh. I am a teacher and <a href=""http://www.jbeardfoto.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">photographer (jbeardfoto.com)</a> living in Beijing, China. My work has been published in both America and Asia, and I have taught creativity training courses to all ages from toddlers to adult professionals.

If you think kids stuff is, well, kids stuff, then maybe there’s a problem with what we’re giving them. They deserve a better quality of education that, rather than assuming we know what they need, helps them to control the storm of ideas and creation already going on inside of them. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/330728/files/20140126121131-bella-rawk-ttop.jpg?1390767091"" src="""" style=""width: 417.59509202453984px; height: 154px;""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Bella here finds your patty-cake to be severely lacking in power-chords.</i></p>
That's why I have started the Strange Tiny People project, where I’ll be traveling to places all over Asia, helping train underprivileged children in creativity and story telling. These children are then going to use their stories to hel<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">p me create a book, filled with their ideas, and their stories. Their stories will be accompanied by photographic illustrations, that I’ll shoot using the children themselves as the subjects. The kids will keep full copyright and credit of their creations.

Asia is simply the most available to me at this moment.<br/><br/>From my years in the Chinese education system, I have seen that, unfortunately, Asian education often omits creativity and exploration learning in lieu of producing higher test scores and uniformity. While there is definitely a place for tradition and cohesiveness in culture, education that neglects personal identity in order to conform to rigid standards often leads to people who tend to follow orders instead of finding ways to produce results. I want to show that, through creative thinking, followers become leaders and produce much more for their society. <br/><br/>Strange Tiny People is meant to be accessible to all children, and I very much intend to eventually visit as many possible locations and spread as much awesome as my feet will carry me. <br/><br/>This is just the first leg on this journey, kiddos.<br/><h2>
<br/>So, You're Helping Poor Kids To Become Starving Artists?...</h2>Creativity isn't just about artistic ability. People with a conditioned creative mind are able to realize different ways of solving problems, socialize and empathize with others, and are more open to very often unnoticed opportunities. <p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">From inventing the next cool gadget, to becoming an awesome painter, running for political office, or just making the best fried rice in town, creativity is often what separates being merely proficient in a skill and being a friggin Jedi Master at it.  </span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">You can't instruct creativity from a text book. It's a skill, and thus requires exercise to perform well, just like any muscle in an athlete's body. Once properly trained and conditioned, creativity becomes natural, and finds it's way into every thought, idea, and decision.

As a professional photographer, I have most of the equipment needed for high-end portraiture like this, however there are some specific travel-friendly equipment that is needed to do a project where there is a lot of location changing, especially when it’s all carried on my back! :*( . This equipment also needs to be insured.

<p>

Transportation is the largest cost, but I'm keeping it down by only using non-flight transportation. Besides, you meet so many more cool people via trains/ buses/ boats/ cow.

我有一张博客叫 Strange Tiny People, 是关于孩子可以相当的朋克，还值得我们更多的尊敬。如果你觉得孩子的东西很没意思，也许我们就应该重新考虑我们给他们的东西。孩子们应当有更好质量的教育，而不是我们去假设他们需要什么。我们要帮助他们开发他们心里的本来就有的想法和创造力。<br/><br/><b></b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/330728/files/20140126121131-bella-rawk-ttop.jpg?1390767091"" src="""" style=""""/> </p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">安琪觉得你的《ABC‘s》被严重缺乏金属甩头。</span><br/></i></p><p></p><p>

</h2>
<br/><br/><h1><b>为什么亚洲？</b></h1>
事实上这个项目旨在为所有儿童，每一种文化，每一种经济阶级，每一种饼干偏好。亚洲是目前对我最可用的。<br/><br/>
从我多年在中国的教育体系，我所看到的，不幸的是，亚洲的教育常常忽略了创造性和探索性的学习方法以代替生产更高的测试分数和均匀性. 虽然传统和凝聚力的文化当然很重要，教育不重视自己的个性，以符合严格的标准，经常引起人们遵循，而不是想出办法来产生结果的订单。我想表明，通过创造性思维，追随者成为领导者，并为他们的社会产生更多的创造力。<br/><br/>
Strange Tiny People是为了能够访问所有的孩子，我打算最终会参观尽可能多的可能的地点和分布尽可能多的真棒的想法。<br/><br/>
这是我们的旅程的第一站，小子！<br/><br/><br/><h1><b>你在帮助穷孩子们当饥饿艺术家?...</b></h1>
创意不只是艺术表现能力。人具有较强的创造性思维能找到不同的方法来解决问题，社交和同情他人，并更细心常常被忽视的机会。<br/><br/>
从发明下一个超酷的小工具，成为一个真棒画家，竞选政治职位，或者只做城里最好的炒饭, 创意常常是区别仅仅精通一门技能，并成为大师吧。<br/><br/>
创意思维就像一块肌肉，固化的思维方式会让大脑很多创意的部分得不到更多的训练. 跟运动员一样，如果他好好锻炼，他的肌肉会一直准备好了能用，因为他的肌肉训练好了，就是自动的。跑步，抬重的东西，打斗， 这样的很容易。所以我的课不是教孩子什么想法很创意什么不创意，我的课就教他们怎么把他们的脑子给锻炼。<br/><br/>
这个课程会帮助孩子们开阔他们的思路，用更多的视角和方式看世界，训练他们平常可能不注意的创意思维。<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_jobs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"" target=""_blank"">Jobs</a>

People are strange. Kids are stranger.
Hi, I’m josh. I am a teacher and photographer (jbeardfoto.com) living in Beijing, China. My work has been published in both America and Asia, and I have taught creativity training courses to all ages from toddlers to adult professionals. I'm also a kung-fu master at Mario Kart. That's me on my creative thinking chair. ;~).I run a blog called Strange Tiny People, which is all about how kids are pretty punk rock, and deserve a lot more respect than we often give them. If you think kids stuff is, well, kids stuff, then maybe there’s a problem with what we’re giving them. They deserve a better quality of education that, rather than assuming we know what they need, helps them to control the storm of ideas and creation already going on inside of them. Bella here finds your patty-cake to be severely lacking in power-chords.
That's why I have started the Strange Tiny People project, where I’ll be traveling to places all over Asia, helping train underprivileged children in creativity and story telling. These children are then going to use their stories to help me create a book, filled with their ideas, and their stories. Their stories will be accompanied by photographic illustrations, that I’ll shoot using the children themselves as the subjects. The kids will keep full copyright and credit of their creations. This is their first published gig, and hopefully the first of many in the future! Some Stories are short and happy, like this: Some have a powerful geo-political message, like this:And some are outright frightening, like this:(STP promotes creativity in all forms, and sees censorship as creativity asphyxiation.)Why Asia?In truth, this project is meant for everyone, of every culture, economic class, and cookie preference. Asia is simply the most available to me at this moment.From my years in the Chinese education system, I have seen that, unfortunately, Asian education often omits creativity and exploration learning in lieu of producing higher test scores and uniformity. While there is definitely a place for tradition and cohesiveness in culture, education that neglects personal identity in order to conform to rigid standards often leads to people who tend to follow orders instead of finding ways to produce results. I want to show that, through creative thinking, followers become leaders and produce much more for their society. Strange Tiny People is meant to be accessible to all children, and I very much intend to eventually visit as many possible locations and spread as much awesome as my feet will carry me. This is just the first leg on this journey, kiddos.
So, You're Helping Poor Kids To Become Starving Artists?...Creativity isn't just about artistic ability. People with a conditioned creative mind are able to realize different ways of solving problems, socialize and empathize with others, and are more open to very often unnoticed opportunities. From inventing the next cool gadget, to becoming an awesome painter, running for political office, or just making the best fried rice in town, creativity is often what separates being merely proficient in a skill and being a friggin Jedi Master at it.  You can't instruct creativity from a text book. It's a skill, and thus requires exercise to perform well, just like any muscle in an athlete's body. Once properly trained and conditioned, creativity becomes natural, and finds it's way into every thought, idea, and decision. You know those guys that seem like they just have it together, and make things seem easy where you're always struggling? Jobs, Picasso, Curie, Waits, Page, Tessla, Chopin, Spike. Those are the guys who have put in the time training their brains to work creatively. Now imagine these guys have had this training instilled since they were children. That's the kind of people I know I want for the next generation. Where is your dough going?   Does a $6k goal seem really low for a project involving almost a year of travel?? Like, really really low??  Like, that’s less than what McDonald’s pays their part time cashiers for a year???That’s because it is. For the past year, I have been saving my own personal money, taking extra jobs and dancing around on fire (no, really), and eating like a freshman college student (noodles, Asia, yeah). This venture will be funded with my money equally along with yours. You didn’t think I would just throw all that burden on your shoulders, did you? 





As a professional photographer, I have most of the equipment needed for high-end portraiture like this, however there are some specific travel-friendly equipment that is needed to do a project where there is a lot of location changing, especially when it’s all carried on my back! :*( . This equipment also needs to be insured. 



Transportation is the largest cost, but I'm keeping it down by only using non-flight transportation. Besides, you meet so many more cool people via trains/ buses/ boats/ cow.






Still have questions? Have an organization that you would like STP to teach at? Want to volunteer as an assistant? Then YOU RAWK! Head over to the FAQ on the website for more info:  http://www.strangetinypeople.com/faq/Perks:Let's talk about the cool schwag you get. Choose from these 4 images:Too strapped for cash/cheap for these top levels? No problem, take a collection with your friends so you can all reap the rewards. Scalp tickets and make some bonus profit. I don't care. I want to help you, use me.
If The Goal Isn't Met..OK, so this project is happening, one way or another. I've already been in contact with dozens of charities, low-income schools, and orphanage over many countries. We're going forward. Kids are gonna get awesome(r). I'll juggle irritated badgers on the street for cash if I have to.The difference your funding makes is how long it goes on. With only my personal money, it won't last long, and there are a lot of kids who will miss out on a lot of opportunities. It's also possible that this book will never make it into anyone's hands, and these guys' stories will never be heard. Other Ways You Can Help""But Josh, I have no monies!"", you might be saying. First: Yes you do. Look, right there to your right, a nickel! (if not, keep looking. It's gotta be there). Point being, everyone has some cash they don't think they have, and every little bit helps. Donate whatever you can. Skip the Arby's drive-through once this week to make up for it. You'll be skinnier and you helped change kids lives. BAZZAM! Double-Karma-Kung-Fu-Madness.Second: If you still feel like that Arby's is more important than a starving child's future (ok ok, those Jamocha shakes really are off the chain), then there is still a way you can help: SHARE THIS THING LIKE MONO.Use your social might! Tweet, like the Facebook, spread the Google+, or write a blog post!Earn a FREE copy of the book by spreading the word! (more on the contest soon)Have a blog about children or photography? Own a news outlet? Work for a radio station? Have a community mahjong group?? Willing to bug your kids' elementary class??? Contact me at josh@strangetinypeople.com . I'd love to be a guest! And of course, all publicity is equally reciprocated on my page. Finally,With all tongue-in-cheek and humour aside. I thank you.I want to see this happen more than anything I have ever done in my life. You get very few precious times in your life where you feel like ""this is absolutely what I'm supposed to be doing"". Every bit you do to help this happen is a drop of hope for me and everyone I can help due to you. You are more important to more people than you will ever know.~Josh.





中文:
人奇怪，孩奇丽.
大家好，我是Josh。 我是老师也是摄影师（jbeardfoto.com）。我的作品在美国及亚洲发表，而且我所教的创造力训练课程，课程对象为各年龄段从幼儿到成人的专业人士。我也是一个马里奥电子游戏功夫大师。:D这是我的创意座位。 ;~) 

我有一张博客叫 Strange Tiny People, 是关于孩子可以相当的朋克，还值得我们更多的尊敬。如果你觉得孩子的东西很没意思，也许我们就应该重新考虑我们给他们的东西。孩子们应当有更好质量的教育，而不是我们去假设他们需要什么。我们要帮助他们开发他们心里的本来就有的想法和创造力。 安琪觉得你的《ABC‘s》被严重缺乏金属甩头。

这就是为什么我开展 Strange Tiny People 项目。我将旅行到很多亚洲地方给贫困儿童教创意和讲故事的方法。然后，这些孩子们将用他们自己的故事来帮助我建立一本书。他们的故事将伴随摄影插图。我将使用孩子本身为拍摄主角。孩子们将继续他们的作品的全部版权和信贷。这是他们第一次出版“违规记录”，而且希望成为许多在未来！
有一些故事是短的和开心的，就像这样：有一些拥有强大地缘政治消息,就像这样：


还有一些真的很可怕，就像这样：
（Strange Tiny People 提倡各种形式的创意，并认为审查使创造力窒息。）

为什么亚洲？
事实上这个项目旨在为所有儿童，每一种文化，每一种经济阶级，每一种饼干偏好。亚洲是目前对我最可用的。
从我多年在中国的教育体系，我所看到的，不幸的是，亚洲的教育常常忽略了创造性和探索性的学习方法以代替生产更高的测试分数和均匀性. 虽然传统和凝聚力的文化当然很重要，教育不重视自己的个性，以符合严格的标准，经常引起人们遵循，而不是想出办法来产生结果的订单。我想表明，通过创造性思维，追随者成为领导者，并为他们的社会产生更多的创造力。
Strange Tiny People是为了能够访问所有的孩子，我打算最终会参观尽可能多的可能的地点和分布尽可能多的真棒的想法。
这是我们的旅程的第一站，小子！你在帮助穷孩子们当饥饿艺术家?...
创意不只是艺术表现能力。人具有较强的创造性思维能找到不同的方法来解决问题，社交和同情他人，并更细心常常被忽视的机会。
从发明下一个超酷的小工具，成为一个真棒画家，竞选政治职位，或者只做城里最好的炒饭, 创意常常是区别仅仅精通一门技能，并成为大师吧。
创意思维就像一块肌肉，固化的思维方式会让大脑很多创意的部分得不到更多的训练. 跟运动员一样，如果他好好锻炼，他的肌肉会一直准备好了能用，因为他的肌肉训练好了，就是自动的。跑步，抬重的东西，打斗， 这样的很容易。所以我的课不是教孩子什么想法很创意什么不创意，我的课就教他们怎么把他们的脑子给锻炼。
这个课程会帮助孩子们开阔他们的思路，用更多的视角和方式看世界，训练他们平常可能不注意的创意思维。Jobs

</p><h3><b>The Journey to Waveland</b></h3>
<p>In
1964, over a thousand volunteers, including many college students, went to Mississippi to call attention to that
state’s brutal repression of African Americans.  They taught in Freedom
Schools and helped register voters for an inclusive “Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party”
in the hope of challenging the legitimacy of the all-white Mississippi
delegates at the Democratic Convention in Atlantic City. </p>
<p>Waveland is the name of a town in Mississippi
where activists from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) gathered
in the aftermath of 1964’s Freedom Summer to discuss the future of what they
called “the Movement”.  After Atlantic
City, they’d lost all faith in conventional politics, but what other politics existed?  In the words of legendary organizer Bob Moses,
they were on a boat in the middle of the ocean, and their boat had to be
rebuilt to stay afloat and had to stay afloat in order to be rebuilt; and to
complicate matters, because they were in the middle of the ocean, they would
have to build the boat themselves.  </p>
<h3><b>The Journey to the novel <i>Waveland</i>  </b></h3>
<p>Simone
Zelitch’s forthcoming novel <i>Waveland</i>
(The Head and the Hand Press 2015) grew out of her fascination with SNCC, an
interracial “beloved community” that had its origins in the student
lunch counter sit-ins that spread throughout the South.  SNCC rejected top-down leadership and
compromise, and served as a model for the great liberation movements of the ’60s and ’70s.   </p>
<p>Yet the novel
also begins with a bedtime story:  “Once
there was a girl who does everything wrong.”
Years after Freedom Summer Beth Fine — who is white and Jewish — tells her
daughter about the time she participated in a wade-in to segregate a pool
without knowing how to swim; or the time she drove down a Mississippi highway, hit a cow,
and ended up in jail for prostitution.  Beth
believes in questioning authority, but as her commitment to the Movement
deepens, the questions begin to change, and the nature of authority becomes
harder to determine. The summer ends,
and Beth remains, struggling to find a place as a white ally in an organization
increasingly under siege and adrift.  </p>
<p>Simone has
always been fascinated by people and events that have been written out of
history: medieval peasants who want to
turn the world upside-down; biblical heretics who challenge the authority of
Moses and Aaron. Her 2001 novel, <i>Louisa</i>, follows a bitter, chain-smoking
holocaust survivor and her German daughter-in-law to the newly established
state of Israel and explores the contradictions and challenges of Zionism and
displacement and the nature of forgiveness.  </p>
<p>When we first created The Head and the Hand
Press, we defined the style of books we want to publish as “those that have the
power to change and entertain.”  We were
instantly drawn into the vulnerability, introspection, strength and courage of
Beth Fine. And we were equally compelled with
the struggles and triumph of the characters in the world Beth inhabits,
fighting each day for basic human rights and democratic principles. And we could not be more honored to bring
this novel to the world and add the story of Beth to the legacy of SNCC and
Freedom Summer.  </p>
<h3><b>How You Can Help Us On This Journey  </b></h3>
<p>The passionate and talented staff
of The Head &amp; The Hand Press have been working with Simone on this book for
almost a year, doing second, third, and fourth readings, as well as
collaborating with Simone on our signature design process that has come to
define our books. Through our attention to detail, we strive to create a physical
reading experience that matches the intellectual experience the author intended
when she conceived the book. And now we need your help to raise the remaining
funds to send this book to the printer. </p>
<p>In addition to defraying the printing expenses<i></i>, we will use
part of the funds we raise to send Simone with copies of <i>Waveland</i> to the Jewish Book Council for its upcoming
conference, where she will have the opportunity join its network of authors. As each major Civil Rights anniversary
passes, Jewish organizations have been finding ways to
celebrate the disproportionate number of Jews who volunteered in Mississippi
Freedom Schools or marched with Martin Luther King in Selma.<i>Waveland</i> is one of the few novels to focus on the role of Jews in
the Movement, and if Simone attends the conference, she will have an
opportunity to pitch <i>Waveland</i> to representatives from synagogues, Jewish
community centers and book fairs, and festivals from across the country.  </p>
<p>If
sending <i>Waveland </i>to the Jewish Book
Council matters to you, please explore those contributor packages. If you simply want to hold this book in your hand and read the story, we hope you find
something appealing among all of the other great contributor packages we are
offering, such as the vintage Mississippi postcards that Simone will mail to you with a personal note during her trip to Hebron in the West Bank this summer. </p>
<p>Although
we feel books are still the most powerful medium to bring stories like <i>Waveland</i> to the world, the costs of printing
are becoming increasingly prohibitive as publishing enters the digital age. But
as we hope you agree, a book doesn’t need to be plugged in or downloaded on
expensive equipment. A book can easily be passed into the hands of anyone, no
matter who they are or where they come from, and that book can change a person’s
life. It’s a combination of your support and our creative approach to
publishing literature that gets these books to print, and puts them into the
hands of our readers. And we at The Head &amp; The Hand Press thank you for
your support.</p>

<div>Let me get down to it. You're all wondering what kind of shenanigan I'm attempting to pull on the day of my 27th birthday. Some of you know me well, some of you think you do, and to some of you I'm just that girl on Twitter. Regardless, I have a story and it's a wild one. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I've invited you here because I'm an experienced and disciplined writer currently working on my first book, and get ready: it's a memoir. Let's be real. Literary agents and book publishers aren't exactly seeking out first-time authors who aren't celebrities or the children of celebrities to offer book deals, and I've so far unsuccessfully navigated my way through the exceptionally rare world of government grants for new authors. The best way to get a grant or a publishing deal to cover the full costs associated with writing a novel is to be an author with previously published works, which makes about as much sense as rolling a snowball in hell.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So this is my plea. Help me get on my way to accomplishing my goal of publishing this book that I have been working on for three years.  Since few people like to give something for nothing or for the sheer joy of having helped someone, there are INCENTIVES and REWARDS for you if you do! Yes, I capitalized those words specifically to capture your attention. Ah-ha, a writer's trick!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Firstly, I assure you that I am asking for the bare minimum to get me on my way. If I were able to fund this myself, I of course would do so. For those of you who don't know me, I have been living pay day to pay day since I first moved out on my own at 16, and being seriously ill for three years and unable to work during much of that time ensured a slightly fearsome bit of debt and a drained savings account.  So I come to you with the hope of making this dream a reality, and because in our technologically advanced age, crowdfunding is pretty much socially acceptable. Crowdfunding allows people who believe in a project to donate to it, and in turn they receive incentives and rewards, as well as the satisfaction of knowing they've aided in dreams coming true and careers being formed. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If the minimum goal is met, amazing. If even more is raised, that would be incredible, because truthfully the costs associated with a first book can be as much as 10x what I'm asking, or more. *IndieGoGo charges me a 9% fee on funds raised IF you don't meet your goal. If you meet your goal, they charge only 4% to me. I will break down a cost estimate below, as well as explain what the immediate needs are, as well as your REWARDS. See, I did it again!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>About The Book &amp; Why It Matters:</h3> <p></p>
<span>I'm sure you want to know what kind of book you are supporting, as you should. So here I go. There are maybe five people in the world who know this story in its entirety. Upon telling them, they have all reacted strongly with disbelief, sadness, or awe. The rest who know me merely only know parts, many have made assumptions, and some have believed rumours. But this story is the complete truth of a once-innocent church girl lost in the world of rock and roll, out on her own at 16, touring North America with anyone who would take her as far away from her own reality as she could run. It's exciting, it's heart-wrenching and it's raw. It's the story of how I dealt with sexual abuse, suicide and being a teenage runaway, and ultimately how I came to conquer it all. I managed to change from being a world-hating, broken-hearted pessimist runaway with a mohawk to an optimistic, bright-eyed young woman, and I learned everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) the hard way. Luckily for the reader, that means the stories within are juicier and wilder than one might imagine a small town Canadian girl could ever live through.<br/><br/>Yes, sharing this story is cathartic for me. Yes, this story is guaranteed to entertain you. This is my one big shot at realizing my dream of becoming a published author. And though nearly everyone who has met me has told me to write a book, this book, I hope, will have a much deeper purpose. It is my hope, that above all, sharing my heart and soul will help save others from the brink. Maybe it's self-aggrandizing to think my story can do that, but I know I'm not the only one <br/><br/>This story is good for a laugh, it's good for a cry, but ultimately, this story is for the people who feel like the biggest screw-ups out there, the ones who have so much to give yet so much pain, the ones who feel lost, invisible, and completely exasperated. It's a story for those who feel like the lowest of the lows, the unlovables, the embarrassments, and the forgotten. It will captivate your heart, it will engage your imagination, but more than anything I want those people to know that if I could survive through this story, they can survive their circumstances. <br/><br/>Please help me publish this story, because you will love it, and because you are surrounded by these broken people, even if you aren't one yourself. They need to know that the past doesn't have to define their future, and that no matter how deep of a pit they're in, they can always, always, always climb out again and start over. <br/><br/>I know they can do it, because I did. <br/><br/>Let me take you on this wild ride that is my true life story.</span><br/><ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Immediate Needs &amp; Costs:</h3> <p></p>
<span>The immediate needs are listed below. As you will see from the costs outlined, my $3000 is a far cry from the actual costs necessary but will get me well on my way to the editing process at least. If extra is raised, that would be incredible and again, as you will see below, clearly already has a designated use. If somehow I raised more money than I ended up needing, the remainder would be donated to the Kidney Foundation in Canada which is close to my heart due to my kidney health issues. Anything raised will sit in its own bank account to be ready for when the costs come out. </span>
</div><div>
<span>The ultimate goal is for a literary agent to shop the book to a publisher, but if that method failed I would self-publish, most likely through Amazon or a similar competitor. The book is about two months out from being sent to my editor. Keep in mind that the time frame for the book being published is fluid, and if you are seeking instant gratification as far as the reward or incentive, this may not be the project for you to support. The book should be published within the year at maximum and all will be updated on its progress regularly, with anyone free to see photocopies of receipts and exact money spent should they wish.<br/><br/>IMMEDIATE NEEDS:<br/>- Laptop (Nothing fancy. My only laptop ever died two years ago, and the book has been largely written on a cracked iPad with limited storage space, by hand, and through journal excerpts which will be included in the book.)<br/>- External hard drive (You'd think I'd have one, but I've been using old school methods.)<br/>- Editing costs are listed below and will need to be paid within the next 2-3 months. I do have a general editor, and costs should remain in the low end, fingers crossed.<br/><br/>FUTURE COSTS WITHIN 2-5 MONTHS:<br/>Developmental Editing - Anywhere from $2000-20,000+<br/>Copy Editor - Anywhere from $500-5,000+<br/>Photography and/or Graphic Design - $100-1000<br/>Literary Agent - Depends on the agent, but not cheap!<br/><br/>GENERAL COSTS FOR SELF-PUBLISHING:<br/>Marketing &amp; PR - Low end $100, High end $5000+<br/>Distribution Fees - Amazon takes a low percentage of each book distributed<br/>Book Printing - Not required to pay upfront, but a low cost per individual order<br/>ISBN (International Standard Book Number) $125</span>
</div> <div> <h3>Incentives &amp; Rewards!</h3> <p>Any help toward this goal is amazing, no matter the dollar amount or whether it is financial help or anything else, and I so appreciate your efforts more than you could possibly imagine. Below are the rewards offered for donating:</p>
<p>$30.00 = Autographed Book</p>
<p>$50.00 = 2 Autographed Books for 1</p>
<p>$75.00 = Autographed Book, Personalized Letter From Author, a Personalized Thank-You in the Dedication </p>

<p>Set in Singapore, this exciting tale blends fantasy and realism as it explores racial and religious prejudice, terrorism and the difficult aspects of growing up.  Shouma Tay is a
13-year-old Singaporean boy with a sweet tooth and a telekinetic gift
he wishes to be ‘cured’ of. But when, with the help of his brilliant Jewish
friend Elijah, he realizes the extent of his powers, he determines to use them
to assist his father, a government security agent, in the fight against a
terrorist bent on carrying out an Al-Qaeda-style attack.  Meanwhile, Rei, a mind-reading Japanese international student, is tracking down the robber of a jewellery shop with the assistance of Irwan, a Malay boy who is sensitive to the paranormal.  When the two
pairs come together, they uncover some frightening truths … and find themselves
with their friendships and even their very lives in danger.</p>

Carew travels the universe, captures alien animals and puts them on display at his huge zoo/amusement park.  When Og wins a week with Carew, he's  thrilled beyond words. His mother, Lucille...not so much. As a field officer to prevent cruelty to alien animals, she's heard some unpleasant rumors about Carew and his zoo. Lucille reluctantly goes along with Og to the zoo (with an ultimatum from her boss to get the dirt on Carew or she'll lose her job).  But things don't quite go as planned, as a horrified Og  soon discovers that neither Carew nor his zoo are what they appear to be, but no one believes him, not even his best friends, Pooks and Rollie. Even worse, Carew and Lucille fall in love. Can Og find the courage to stand up to the man he admires most in the world,  keep his Mom from making a terrible mistake, and stop an alien invasion? Not to mention anal probes.</p>

<h2>
<strong>   <em>Mission Statement</em></strong><em> </em>
</h2>
<p class=""short-blurb"">This campaign’s focus is about triumphant healing and the cure for hate, anger and prejudice through positive expression.</p>
<h2><em><strong>   Campaign Description</strong></em></h2>
<p>Our idea is to create a way for people to express positive messages that promote a color-blind approach to equality and universal love. The creation of t-shirts, coffee mugs, window clings, stickers, magnets, key-chains and pens that express positive messages that contradict hate, anger and prejudice will display these positive messages in a very public way. This type of positive reinforcement of peace and love will not only give the user/wearer the opportunity for positive interaction with others, but also provide a blessing to anyone who sees them. This might just be that unexpected little “pick-me-up” someone needs as well as keeping thoughts of peace and love in the forefront of your mind.</p>
<p> <img alt=""The Thanks We Could Give You Would Never Compare to the Gratification You Will Feel by Contributing to the Cure for Hate, Anger and Prejudice."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/503882/pictures/full/20121023145018-Slide85.JPG?1351029043"" src="""" style="""" title=""Cure Hate, Anger &amp; Prejudice Thank You Image ""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><em>Campaign Goal Description</em></h2>
<p>   We have recently experienced an incident related to hate, anger and prejudice. (Please read our story below.) We’ve all experienced it at some point in our life. We don’t know what was different about this time but it created a spark. That spark has grown into a passionate flame of inspiration to act out against it in a positive way. <strong><em>When hate and anger are experienced and the victims don’t speak out, that hate and anger lives and therefore exists completely unchecked.</em></strong> My husband and I have created a crowdfunded campaign on Indiegogo.com that would effect a positive change. We are trying to initiate and build an organization that can contribute to the cure for hate, anger and prejudice. Our long term goal is to become a large non-profit organization. Until we grow large enough and acquire non-profit status, our immediate goal is to fund a campaign that promotes positive expression against hate and prejudice. Once established we will be forever committed to giving as much time, effort and revenue as possible to curing hate and prejudice. This will include awareness campaigns like this one as well as anything from feeding hungry children to drilling water wells and so on.</p>
<h2><em>Campaign Goal Amount</em></h2>
<p>Our project goal amount is based on accomplishing initial production runs that are large enough to absorb set-up and design expenses while keeping individual item costs down to sensible levels.</p>

<h2><em>“Our Story”</em></h2>
<p>   We wanted to give everyone a basic summary of what brought us to start this campaign. Daily life in today’s world is filled with both darkness and enlightenment. We believe the outcome of any one person’s day, week, month, year, or life has everything to do with how you deal with the different aspects of positive and negative. Are you a confident happy person that lets the negative roll off like water on a duck’s back or do you get angry when something or someone unfortunate crosses your path? Dealing with the good is the easy part; it’s the negative that provides our struggles. Sometimes its money, sometimes its circumstance, sometimes its someone who has done or said something hurtful or saddening, sometimes its controllable and sometimes its not. This world is full of people who live and give love and kindness to everyone they meet, as well as people who display anger, hate and even prejudice. We believe simply ignoring the negative is a good first step, but to take action and actually do something positive to directly oppose that negative is triumphant.</p>
<p>  We feel it’s necessary to share with you the specifics of a few personal experiences so that you have a clear picture of exactly what has brought us to take the positive action that we feel this campaign represents. We would first like to say that it’s our belief that all life is precious regardless of type or classification. We rarely speak of race, although due to the nature of these experiences, in this instance it is necessary.</p>
<p>  We were recently “road raged” by a guy in a pick-up who passed us on the outside of a turn, horn blowing because he thought we were going too slowly. Purely by chance, approximately two minutes later, we ended up being parked directly on the other side of the gas pump from him. (NOTE: We are in the Carolinas, driving a vehicle with a northern New England registration.) My husband casually said to him, “Hey, that wasn’t all that safe for either one of us.” His reply was to tell us, “To take your ‘blank’ Yankee ‘blanks’ back home.” This must have left quite a look on my husband’s face because the guy followed it with, “You have no idea what you’re dealing with.” (Just to be clear, he was Caucasian and so are we.) Later that afternoon, we were getting a laugh out of what happened to us with a good friend of ours. (Just to be clear, our friend is African American.) In the more serious side of our conversation, he pointed out the underlying layer of discrimination and said that to call us Yankees is the same as someone calling him a “blank”. We then talked in wonder about how anyone could still be ticked off at the abolishment of slavery in this country.</p>
<p>  Experiencing hate and prejudice in today’s world is a subject that many of us could write many pages about. After discussing which experiences really stuck out, we decided that my husband’s personal account of the next two best represent each end of the spectrum. Here’s his story:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">  “Let’s rewind fifteen years or so to another experience that has always stood out in my mind. I was out of work and wasn’t having a lot of luck finding any, so I got the bright idea to drive to New York City because I was sure I could get some work somewhere and figured I could always rent a room at the YMCA until I worked out all the details. Wish I had called first; there was a waiting list a month long. Determined to make it, I decided that I could sleep in my van for a bit. It’s kind of like camping, truck stop showers and food out of a can. I worked a little here and there, built a deck, did a roof, but hadn’t found anything substantial or steady, until I hooked up with a company that did cable TV installations. By then the weather had gotten pretty cold and a couple of the other installers noticed the inside of my van one morning, and when they found out I was parking on the street or at the train stations, they told me that it was safer to park behind their house at night. These guys were younger and still living with their mom and when she found out that very night, she sent them down to come get me out of the cold. They let me, a complete stranger, stay with them until I found a place of my own. We became friends and in a conversation about life one day, they shared with me the fact that they knew nothing of prejudice or hate before they came to this country. (Just to be clear, they were from Trinidad.) These people didn’t judge me by the color of my skin; they just saw me, sleeping in the cold.”</p>
<p><img alt=""There are still places in the world where hate, anger and prejudice do not exist. Hate is a disease of the mind... vaccinate your community today. "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/503885/pictures/full/20121023145105-Slide44.JPG?1351029122"" src="""" style="""" title=""Trinidad Informational Image ""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">  “Now let’s rewind a few more years. I was five or six years old, the TV was on, and I heard something my own father say that broke my heart before I even knew my heart could be broken. He said, “Martin Luther King, Jr. was just another ignorant ‘blank’”. Even at that age where I didn’t really fully understand the scope of the whole thing, I knew what he said had to be terribly wrong.”</p>
<p>  The experiences of life mold you, but it is what you do with those experiences that make you who you are. Some may say we are naive but we believe hate is a disease that can be cured. We believe the more people express themselves in a positive manner, the more contagious love and kindness will become. Please help us fund this campaign. This is a campaign of triumphant expression of peace and love against prejudice and hate. It will create an avenue for those who want to express their positive stance on such an important social and sometimes political issue. Supporting this campaign, wearing these shirts, and displaying these bumper stickers, window clings, and magnets can be your triumphant expression of peace and love against prejudice and hate.</p>

<h2><em>A Word on Shipping</em></h2>
<p>A penny saved is a penny earned and I don’t want you to have to pay one extra penny over what is necessary for shipping. The most inexpensive solution for everyone is to calculate shipping for your package to your destination individually. Not including the shipping costs with your support also means saving the percentages that are collected from final goal totals.</p>
<p>Please know that handling shipping this way will save you all a lot of money but will also be labor intensive and time consuming for me. That’s ok though, I don’t mind. Shipping amounts on all packages will be calculated and sent to you via email with a notification that your package is ready to be shipped. All payments for shipping will require setting up a PayPal account if you don't already have one. It’s really easy and you can pay using your bank account, debit, or credit card. It’s free, secure, and takes no time at all. Go to <a href=""http://www.paypal.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.paypal.com</a>.</p>
<h1><em>For Your Information</em></h1>
<h2><em>Shirt Color Individuality</em></h2>
<p>All shirts are individually tied and dyed; shades and patterns will vary slightly from shirt to shirt. No two shirts are alike. Due to the variation in tie-dyed shirts, the silk screened message may be in either dark blue or white lettering as required. Also, however unlikely it may be, shirt color availability may change.</p>
<p>All shirts are 100% pre-shrunk cotton, name brand and are “true to fit”. If your regular size is a bit snug and your clothes are subjected to extra hot dryers (such as Laundromats), you may want to order the next size larger. This is completely up to your discretion. No returns will be accepted.</p>

   Mission Statement 

This campaign’s focus is about triumphant healing and the cure for hate, anger and prejudice through positive expression.
   Campaign Description
Our idea is to create a way for people to express positive messages that promote a color-blind approach to equality and universal love. The creation of t-shirts, coffee mugs, window clings, stickers, magnets, key-chains and pens that express positive messages that contradict hate, anger and prejudice will display these positive messages in a very public way. This type of positive reinforcement of peace and love will not only give the user/wearer the opportunity for positive interaction with others, but also provide a blessing to anyone who sees them. This might just be that unexpected little “pick-me-up” someone needs as well as keeping thoughts of peace and love in the forefront of your mind.
 
 
Campaign Goal Description
   We have recently experienced an incident related to hate, anger and prejudice. (Please read our story below.) We’ve all experienced it at some point in our life. We don’t know what was different about this time but it created a spark. That spark has grown into a passionate flame of inspiration to act out against it in a positive way. When hate and anger are experienced and the victims don’t speak out, that hate and anger lives and therefore exists completely unchecked. My husband and I have created a crowdfunded campaign on Indiegogo.com that would effect a positive change. We are trying to initiate and build an organization that can contribute to the cure for hate, anger and prejudice. Our long term goal is to become a large non-profit organization. Until we grow large enough and acquire non-profit status, our immediate goal is to fund a campaign that promotes positive expression against hate and prejudice. Once established we will be forever committed to giving as much time, effort and revenue as possible to curing hate and prejudice. This will include awareness campaigns like this one as well as anything from feeding hungry children to drilling water wells and so on.
Campaign Goal Amount
Our project goal amount is based on accomplishing initial production runs that are large enough to absorb set-up and design expenses while keeping individual item costs down to sensible levels.

“Our Story”
   We wanted to give everyone a basic summary of what brought us to start this campaign. Daily life in today’s world is filled with both darkness and enlightenment. We believe the outcome of any one person’s day, week, month, year, or life has everything to do with how you deal with the different aspects of positive and negative. Are you a confident happy person that lets the negative roll off like water on a duck’s back or do you get angry when something or someone unfortunate crosses your path? Dealing with the good is the easy part; it’s the negative that provides our struggles. Sometimes its money, sometimes its circumstance, sometimes its someone who has done or said something hurtful or saddening, sometimes its controllable and sometimes its not. This world is full of people who live and give love and kindness to everyone they meet, as well as people who display anger, hate and even prejudice. We believe simply ignoring the negative is a good first step, but to take action and actually do something positive to directly oppose that negative is triumphant.
  We feel it’s necessary to share with you the specifics of a few personal experiences so that you have a clear picture of exactly what has brought us to take the positive action that we feel this campaign represents. We would first like to say that it’s our belief that all life is precious regardless of type or classification. We rarely speak of race, although due to the nature of these experiences, in this instance it is necessary.
  We were recently “road raged” by a guy in a pick-up who passed us on the outside of a turn, horn blowing because he thought we were going too slowly. Purely by chance, approximately two minutes later, we ended up being parked directly on the other side of the gas pump from him. (NOTE: We are in the Carolinas, driving a vehicle with a northern New England registration.) My husband casually said to him, “Hey, that wasn’t all that safe for either one of us.” His reply was to tell us, “To take your ‘blank’ Yankee ‘blanks’ back home.” This must have left quite a look on my husband’s face because the guy followed it with, “You have no idea what you’re dealing with.” (Just to be clear, he was Caucasian and so are we.) Later that afternoon, we were getting a laugh out of what happened to us with a good friend of ours. (Just to be clear, our friend is African American.) In the more serious side of our conversation, he pointed out the underlying layer of discrimination and said that to call us Yankees is the same as someone calling him a “blank”. We then talked in wonder about how anyone could still be ticked off at the abolishment of slavery in this country.
  Experiencing hate and prejudice in today’s world is a subject that many of us could write many pages about. After discussing which experiences really stuck out, we decided that my husband’s personal account of the next two best represent each end of the spectrum. Here’s his story:
  “Let’s rewind fifteen years or so to another experience that has always stood out in my mind. I was out of work and wasn’t having a lot of luck finding any, so I got the bright idea to drive to New York City because I was sure I could get some work somewhere and figured I could always rent a room at the YMCA until I worked out all the details. Wish I had called first; there was a waiting list a month long. Determined to make it, I decided that I could sleep in my van for a bit. It’s kind of like camping, truck stop showers and food out of a can. I worked a little here and there, built a deck, did a roof, but hadn’t found anything substantial or steady, until I hooked up with a company that did cable TV installations. By then the weather had gotten pretty cold and a couple of the other installers noticed the inside of my van one morning, and when they found out I was parking on the street or at the train stations, they told me that it was safer to park behind their house at night. These guys were younger and still living with their mom and when she found out that very night, she sent them down to come get me out of the cold. They let me, a complete stranger, stay with them until I found a place of my own. We became friends and in a conversation about life one day, they shared with me the fact that they knew nothing of prejudice or hate before they came to this country. (Just to be clear, they were from Trinidad.) These people didn’t judge me by the color of my skin; they just saw me, sleeping in the cold.”

  “Now let’s rewind a few more years. I was five or six years old, the TV was on, and I heard something my own father say that broke my heart before I even knew my heart could be broken. He said, “Martin Luther King, Jr. was just another ignorant ‘blank’”. Even at that age where I didn’t really fully understand the scope of the whole thing, I knew what he said had to be terribly wrong.”
  The experiences of life mold you, but it is what you do with those experiences that make you who you are. Some may say we are naive but we believe hate is a disease that can be cured. We believe the more people express themselves in a positive manner, the more contagious love and kindness will become. Please help us fund this campaign. This is a campaign of triumphant expression of peace and love against prejudice and hate. It will create an avenue for those who want to express their positive stance on such an important social and sometimes political issue. Supporting this campaign, wearing these shirts, and displaying these bumper stickers, window clings, and magnets can be your triumphant expression of peace and love against prejudice and hate.

<h2><span style=""color: #2e9afe;""><strong>If you can't make it for a climb, pre-order my book by making a pledge to help girls like Sarah with Rett Syndrome.</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>I would like to invite you to pledge your support to win a free all expense paid trip to Mt. Everest when you get my book. At the Advance Base Camp level you will also receive my amazing <strong>K</strong><strong>Reader™</strong> application with the book. At Camp 1 you will also get the powerful all-in-one real time eLearner application for your lifelong reading and learning pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span>What would you do to help your child who was having major problems? Go to the Moon? Climb Mount Everest? For parents, the answer is usually, “Yes, what ever it takes.” This is a true life story of my family’s journey chronicled in this book and together within my KReader™ application and KLearner™ application that I hope with your support to have in your hands come this November.</span></p>
<p><span>My name is Erwin Sniedzins. I am the father of Sarah who was born so normal and then slowly began to slip back into a darkness I could not understand. How could I do something more concrete to help my baby Sarah and girls like Sarah? How could I reach out to doctors, specialists to research Rett Syndrome? How could I raise a lot of money for research and parent support?  How could I raise the world awareness of Rett Syndrome? </span></p>

<p><strong>You Can Help!</strong></p>
<p>That’s why I organized an expedition to climb Mt. Everest.  My book ""Three Pillars of Love - The Mt. Everest Expedition” (working title) is based on my true story and people who had been involved and supported me in this journey.</p>
<p>The expedition journey that I organized to Mt. Everest took about five years. I resigned from Xerox Canada, after 18 years, to make it a full time effort. Along the way I had a lot of help from companies such as Cathay Pacific, Canada Trust, and people such as: Sir Edmund Hillary (the first man to stand on top of Everest), Sir Peter Ustinov, Ms. Raisa Gorbachev (Wife of the President of the USSR), Ann Rohmer (TV celebrity), Mila Mulroney (Wife of the Prime Minister of Canada), Valerie Pringle (TV celebrity), The Honourable Lincoln Alexander (Lieutenant Governor of Ontario), etc. The ""Climb for Hope"" documentary movie was the result of these efforts ((you can see this movie in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amazon.com</a>).</p>

If you can't make it for a climb, pre-order my book by making a pledge to help girls like Sarah with Rett Syndrome.
I would like to invite you to pledge your support to win a free all expense paid trip to Mt. Everest when you get my book. At the Advance Base Camp level you will also receive my amazing KReader™ application with the book. At Camp 1 you will also get the powerful all-in-one real time eLearner application for your lifelong reading and learning pleasure.
What would you do to help your child who was having major problems? Go to the Moon? Climb Mount Everest? For parents, the answer is usually, “Yes, what ever it takes.” This is a true life story of my family’s journey chronicled in this book and together within my KReader™ application and KLearner™ application that I hope with your support to have in your hands come this November.
My name is Erwin Sniedzins. I am the father of Sarah who was born so normal and then slowly began to slip back into a darkness I could not understand. How could I do something more concrete to help my baby Sarah and girls like Sarah? How could I reach out to doctors, specialists to research Rett Syndrome? How could I raise a lot of money for research and parent support?  How could I raise the world awareness of Rett Syndrome? 

Read about Rett Syndrome on Wikipedia
You Can Help!
That’s why I organized an expedition to climb Mt. Everest.  My book ""Three Pillars of Love - The Mt. Everest Expedition” (working title) is based on my true story and people who had been involved and supported me in this journey.
The expedition journey that I organized to Mt. Everest took about five years. I resigned from Xerox Canada, after 18 years, to make it a full time effort. Along the way I had a lot of help from companies such as Cathay Pacific, Canada Trust, and people such as: Sir Edmund Hillary (the first man to stand on top of Everest), Sir Peter Ustinov, Ms. Raisa Gorbachev (Wife of the President of the USSR), Ann Rohmer (TV celebrity), Mila Mulroney (Wife of the Prime Minister of Canada), Valerie Pringle (TV celebrity), The Honourable Lincoln Alexander (Lieutenant Governor of Ontario), etc. The ""Climb for Hope"" documentary movie was the result of these efforts ((you can see this movie in Amazon.com).
____________________________________________________________________________

Summary 
I need your help to develop the KReader™ and to tell this story, edit, publish, market and distribute the 3PL book with the KReader™. I also hope that by getting the story out it will help to raise international awareness of Rett Syndrome. We have found the cause but still need to find a cure.
I invite you to join me on this 3PL KReader™ and Publishing expedition and to tell your friends about our climb. Together we can get to the top.

I’m your host Scott Nicolay bringing you news and interviews with the creative talents who operate far beyond the edge of the firelight. There Are Weird Things Out Here, My Friends…</i></p><p>When I conceived The Outer Dark podcast in 2015, I never expected it to take off like it has and to mean so much to listeners. As the tendrils of the Weird spread further into speculative and even mainstream fiction, film and TV, people keep asking me when we were going to do something more hands-on. Thus was born The Outer Dark Symposium on the Greater Weird.</p><p>A key goal is to keep the symposium affordable ($25) for readers and writers, with everyone attending all programming and sharing breakfast and lunch together. We also will be providing an opportunity to continue the conversation at an after-party in the evening. We’ve crunched every figure and cut corners as far as we possibly can, but to rent a great space for an entire day, fly in some out-of-town guests, provide food services, and print a collectible program chapbook still takes money. In other words, to accomplish ALL this at this crazy price point, we ask humbly for your help.</p><p>That’s why we created this Indiegogo campaign through which you can purchase:</p><ul>
<li>Supporting Membership ($20, includes program chapbook, limited to 100 copies &amp; signed by all 17 program participants)</li>
<li>Basic Attending Membership ($25 for day event including meals)</li>
<li>Deluxe Membership ($50 for day event &amp; evening party)</li>
<li>VIP Membership ($100, includes exclusive brunch with author guests &amp; more)</li>

I’m your host Scott Nicolay bringing you news and interviews with the creative talents who operate far beyond the edge of the firelight. There Are Weird Things Out Here, My Friends…When I conceived The Outer Dark podcast in 2015, I never expected it to take off like it has and to mean so much to listeners. As the tendrils of the Weird spread further into speculative and even mainstream fiction, film and TV, people keep asking me when we were going to do something more hands-on. Thus was born The Outer Dark Symposium on the Greater Weird.A key goal is to keep the symposium affordable ($25) for readers and writers, with everyone attending all programming and sharing breakfast and lunch together. We also will be providing an opportunity to continue the conversation at an after-party in the evening. We’ve crunched every figure and cut corners as far as we possibly can, but to rent a great space for an entire day, fly in some out-of-town guests, provide food services, and print a collectible program chapbook still takes money. In other words, to accomplish ALL this at this crazy price point, we ask humbly for your help.That’s why we created this Indiegogo campaign through which you can purchase:
Supporting Membership ($20, includes program chapbook, limited to 100 copies & signed by all 17 program participants)
Basic Attending Membership ($25 for day event including meals)
Deluxe Membership ($50 for day event & evening party)
VIP Membership ($100, includes exclusive brunch with author guests & more)

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>China and the U.S. The Race to Develop the Self-Driving Car analyzes the technological, political/regulatory, and business-related difficulties that both nations face in developing and producing autonomous vehicles (AVs). This book discusses the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles for society; some of which include greater freedom of transportation for blind, disabled, or elderly people, reduced traffic congestion, and substantial efficiency boosts to industries such as the long-haul freight trucking industry.<br/><br/>My name is Phillip Wilcox and I am the author of China and the U.S. Race to Develop the Self-Driving Car. I wrote this book after an unfortunate accident in 2012 left me legally blind. In my efforts to recover elements of my independence, I have become very passionate about autonomous vehicles and their potential. Not only do AVs offer individuals like me greater freedom to live day-to-day life, but they also help improve the lives of millions of others when they’re used to improve society.<br/><br/>My hope is that by reading this book you will learn about the challenges that we face in developing AVs. This includes the larger economic and political strife between the U.S. and China, as well as the business challenges in this potentially trillion dollar industry. I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the future of AVs in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you evaluate the use of AVs. Hopefully, you will learn to trust AVs and look forward to the incredible safety and productivity benefits they offer.<br/><br/><strong>In this book, you'll learn about:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The different financial and/or business models that companies are exploring to make autonomous vehicles profitable </p></li>
<li>The political problems that the U.S. and China faces in governing the technology behind autonomous vehicles.</li>
<li>The technological difficulties companies are facing as they try to build a self-driving vehicle.</li>
<li>The many incredible benefits that autonomous vehicles can offer to society.</li>
</ul>You will love this book if you are interested in really exciting technology, technology that was previously only thought possible in Sci-Fi movies, or if you are interested in new business models and business policy. <br/><br/>China and the U.S. Race to Develop the Self-Driving Car is a non-fiction book that speaks to political enthusiasts and people interested in business and new technology. It is for those who are looking at policy for new technology development and international technology competition between great powers for the first time.<br/> <h3>China and the U.S. The Race to Develop the Self-Driving Car</h3>
<p>The book is written in four parts.<br/>Part 1 contains the introduction, which includes a description of the benefits and push-back of autonomous vehicles in the U.S.. It also includes a chapter on the visual sensors of the autonomous vehicle and a chapter describing the “central nervous system” of the autonomous vehicle. This part shows why these two countries are racing towards producing autonomous vehicles and describes what exactly that means.<br/><br/>Part two contains chapters describing the up-hill battle for trust and acceptance of autonomous vehicles in the U.S. It contains chapters on Waymo, Uber, and Tesla. This section shows that even though the U.S. began developing autonomous vehicles before China, problems with a lack of public trust and suitable business models for AVs might cause it to fall behind.<br/><br/>Part three contains a chapter describing Xi Jinping’s desire to transform the Chinese economy, a chapters on Baidu’s Apollo Project and a chapter on the self-driving car company AutoX,. This section describes how a better public-private partnership and greater interest by the CCP in developing new technology is a big reason why China is catching up to the U.S.<br/><br/>Part four contains a section related to the difficulties that the U.S. faces in developing state, federal and global policy towards autonomous vehicles. This section argues that while the problems related to state and national laws governing autonomous vehicles are temporary and can be addressed, the global arena of setting standards will be the next big fight between the U.S. and China in their ongoing trade dispute.<br/> </p>

After 2-3 years of trying, I somehow managed to collect drops of time and poured them into a bucket. I worked on filling one bucket at a time and progressed at a snail's pace. Converted each such bucket into a story that I wrote mainly during official train journeys from Chennai to Bangalore. A story emerged about two IIT-IIM middle aged friends who come together to write a book. This roller coaster ride through campus life, parties, ghosts, cricket, Bollywood, murder mystery, sci-fi and intense introspection has been sewn together to form a 'connection' of stories called <i><b>The Book: A train of thoughts. </b></i>Reference to the train here is a tribute to the journeys undertaken and also to the fantastic journey called life. </p><p>As I kept dreaming about this book becoming a big hit and me becoming a Hollywood script writer in the next few years, I also kept thinking in parallel that it was time to give back to the society in some way. Finally, decided to use my debut book as a tool to make a difference to a niche set of highly deserving people: disadvantaged painters. </p><p>My idea is to use 8 sketches / paintings, one for each chapter. What will be unique is that each painting will be created by a disadvantaged painter. Fortunately, after speaking to several NGOs and organizations, I decided to partner with Spastics Society of Tamil Nadu. They are the most wonderful set of people! My painters have deficiencies of some form or the other but they are incredibly talented. Their works shall adorn my book and am sure you will love to see what they are capable of creating. . So what I want is for people to contribute and <b>I will channelize all profits to make a difference to them. Some funds will go to painters directly and the rest to the school(s).</b></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p><ul>
<li>I am looking at a funding of $7500 in all. As a debut author and with the idea of inserting paintings / sketches, social cause etc, I wasn't sure if the existing publishing houses would encourage it. Initial reactions were not promising. So, a big chunk of the costs will be the self-publishing piece. The other cost elements are the base price of each painting, marketing and distribution expenses. I have employed a small team of enthusiastic MBA students from NMIMS that work free and a token salary would be a great way to acknowledge their efforts. </li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The journey has begun and we shall undertake this no matter what. So, if I dont get the full money I am looking for, I will borrow and get this done. </span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Perk for you is that you not only get a signed copy of the book, I shall add the top 100 contributor names in the book itself. If you contribute more than $15, for each $15 multiple, you can also gift a copy to your close friends. </span></li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p><p>Inaction
is not necessarily equal to no intention or indifference</p>
<p><span>- </span>Sometimes inaction is due to pursuit of
a perfect state </p>
<p>My
realization:</p>
<p><span>- </span>Do you wish
to travel around the world? A <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Journey around the world could be via
infinite routes – from West to East, or North to South or any other route ...</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">But whichever route you take, the first
step is to open the door to step out. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Art of the Possible starts with the
first step and this effort of mine is that step towards making a difference to
disadvantaged painters</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The impact that you could make is tremendous. The real success would be to create sustainable opportunities but as a start, the opportunities that will get created are:</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">- Clinical support</span><br/></p><p>- Financial support to run their families</p><p>- Survival / Sustenance – food, cloth, shelter</p><p>- Career – job opportunities</p>With Spastic Society, depending on the funds collected and future income streams, I would love to set up a facility that encourages paintings / sketching among disabled kids. If more people come together to sustain this initiative, the impact will be long term and a small difference will indeed be made.  <p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span><br/></p><p>There are so many things you could do if you take those tiny steps:</p><ul>

Reference to the train here is a tribute to the journeys undertaken and also to the fantastic journey called life. As I kept dreaming about this book becoming a big hit and me becoming a Hollywood script writer in the next few years, I also kept thinking in parallel that it was time to give back to the society in some way. Finally, decided to use my debut book as a tool to make a difference to a niche set of highly deserving people: disadvantaged painters. My idea is to use 8 sketches / paintings, one for each chapter. What will be unique is that each painting will be created by a disadvantaged painter. Fortunately, after speaking to several NGOs and organizations, I decided to partner with Spastics Society of Tamil Nadu. They are the most wonderful set of people! My painters have deficiencies of some form or the other but they are incredibly talented. Their works shall adorn my book and am sure you will love to see what they are capable of creating. . So what I want is for people to contribute and I will channelize all profits to make a difference to them. Some funds will go to painters directly and the rest to the school(s).What I Need & What You GetBreak it down for folks in more detail:
I am looking at a funding of $7500 in all. As a debut author and with the idea of inserting paintings / sketches, social cause etc, I wasn't sure if the existing publishing houses would encourage it. Initial reactions were not promising. So, a big chunk of the costs will be the self-publishing piece. The other cost elements are the base price of each painting, marketing and distribution expenses. I have employed a small team of enthusiastic MBA students from NMIMS that work free and a token salary would be a great way to acknowledge their efforts. 

The journey has begun and we shall undertake this no matter what. So, if I dont get the full money I am looking for, I will borrow and get this done. 

Perk for you is that you not only get a signed copy of the book, I shall add the top 100 contributor names in the book itself. If you contribute more than $15, for each $15 multiple, you can also gift a copy to your close friends. 
The ImpactInaction
is not necessarily equal to no intention or indifference
- Sometimes inaction is due to pursuit of
a perfect state 
My
realization:
- Do you wish
to travel around the world? A Journey around the world could be via
infinite routes – from West to East, or North to South or any other route ...But whichever route you take, the first
step is to open the door to step out. The Art of the Possible starts with the
first step and this effort of mine is that step towards making a difference to
disadvantaged paintersThe impact that you could make is tremendous. The real success would be to create sustainable opportunities but as a start, the opportunities that will get created are:- Clinical support- Financial support to run their families- Survival / Sustenance – food, cloth, shelter- Career – job opportunitiesWith Spastic Society, depending on the funds collected and future income streams, I would love to set up a facility that encourages paintings / sketching among disabled kids. If more people come together to sustain this initiative, the impact will be long term and a small difference will indeed be made.  Other Ways You Can HelpThere are so many things you could do if you take those tiny steps:

<h3>Bienvenidos a mi campaña</h3>
<div>Mi nombre es Valentina M, tengo 14 años y practico remo desde los 10 años.</div>
<div>Durante estos años, me he esforzado por tener una buena técnica, una buena disciplina y control en todos los aspectos de mi vida.  </div>
<div>En la fecha tengo propuestas para poder entrenarme con miras a  las próximas Olimpiadas, dado el buen rendimiento que he tenido, pero para lograr mis objetivos, tengo que participar en varias regatas nacionales, e internacionales, para que me puedan evaluar, y con suerte y dedicación poder ser parte del equipo Olímpico de Remo.  </div>
<div>Quisiera poder participar de las regatas que se realizaran en el mes de octubre en Perú, competencias que serán fundamentales para poder medir mi progreso en busca de la consecución de mis objetivos.</div>
<div>Se que lograr estas metas, no solo es importante para mi, sino también para mi equipo, mis entrenadores y mi familia que siempre me han alentado, y gracias a Dios siempre les he podido responder bien a las expectativas que han puesto en mi.</div>
<div>Espero también poder cumplir con las expectativas que usted como colaborador de mi campaña tenga, y poder llegar a clasificar al Equipo Olímpico con su ayuda.</div>
<div>Si estas listo para colaborar te diré que el dinero recaudado es para costear el viaje desde Buenos Aires a Perú, junto con un acompañante, ya que soy menor de edad y no puedo viajar sola, mas los gastos de alojamiento y comida, transportes en Perú, por espacio de 6 días, dos ciudades, dos regatas.</div>
<div>Si no lograra mis objetivos, el dinero recaudado no lo podría devolver, pues de todas formas se habrá de gastar para poder participar en las regatas.  Yo realmente confió en que puedo realizar un buen papel en las competencias, pero no podría garantizar el triunfo porque seria deshonesto de mi parte prometer algo que aunque tenga toda la gana, el deseo y la capacidad necesaria, solo el día de la competencia sabre si he logrado el triunfo.</div>
<div>Me gustaría contar con tu apoyo, y si Dios quiere cuando logre una medalla Olímpica, sientas el placer de decir yo colabore para que ese sueño se hiciera realidad.</div>
<div>Mi carrera en el Remo comenzo a los 10 años, y mi profesor, viendo las buenas condiciones que tenia, me sugirió un club de Remo donde pudieran explotar todo el potencial que desde un principio tenia.</div>
<div>Para mi primera competencia el profesor nos preparo psicologicamente para que no nos afectara la derrota, lo que no sabia nuestro profesor es que ese mismo día nos colgamos tres medallas.</div>
<div>Así he participado ya en muchas regatas. durante el ultimo año he participado en 8 regatas, de las cuales he ganado 7 medallas de Oro y una de plata.</div>
<div>No es un trabajo fácil, yo voy a la escuela,(donde me va muy bien),me levanto todos los días a las 5:30 a.m. hasta las 4:30 p.m. y llego a casa a las 6:00 p.m pues tengo mas de una hora de recorrido en tren.  Voy a entrenamiento los martes y jueves,  de 6:00 p.m.  a  8:00 p.m y sábados y domingos  voy de 9:00 a 11:00 a.m. y hago un doble turno de 2:00 a 4:00 p.m.  En lo posible no falto a ninguno de ellos, pues me he comprometido conmigo misma a hacer de este deporte algo importante en mi vida y lo estoy logrando, </div>
<div>Se que aveces aunque uno quiera no puede colaborar, o no de la forma que uno quisiera, asi que te pido que si no puedes colaborar economicamente con esta campaña. no te desanimes y  te pido que compartas y difundas esta campaña con todos tus amigos y conocidos, puedes usar las herramientas de Indiegogo para difundirla.</div>

Lecco ai piedi del monte S. Martino, è uno di questi luoghi.</p>

di personaggi che furono alternativamente protagonisti o comparse di vicende
festose, gioiose e tragiche. </p>
<p>Nel Quattrocento le monache del vicino monastero di S. Maria Maddalena fecero
del luogo un fertile podere i cui prodotti imbandirono i refettori del cenobio
lecchese fino al 1789, quando la tenuta di <i>Brogno</i> fu'
venduta all'asta e aggiudicata a Gian Giuseppe Airoldi.</p>
<p>Gli Airoldi di <i>Brogno</i>
trasformarono  il preesistente rustico
delle monache in una grande  casa colonica, ma, a metà
dell’Ottocento,  furono travolti da
spietati creditori. Giunse in loro soccorso il ricchissimo zio milanese
Giuseppe Gargantini Piatti che acquistò all'asta e salvò da ingloriose
speculazioni il podere di <i>Brogno</i>.</p>
<p>In soli quattro anni - su progetto dell’ ingegnere Riccardo Badoni,– la

curioso aspetto alpino, che divenne la scenografia delle bucoliche

<p>Nel 1929 l'edificio venne  acquistato da Alfredo Redaelli principale e
coraggioso fondatore di un rinomato vellutificio che per decenni dominò il

<p>Di certo Alfredo portava nel sangue i geni di una dinastia di intraprendenti

il nonno, Francesco Redaelli, che  aveva
gettato le basi dei capitali familiari con la sua professione di gabelliere; il
padre, Savino Redaelli, generoso patriota che aveva partecipato alle campagne
garibaldine.</p>
<p>Oggi <i>Brogno</i> continua a essere un luogo in cui architettura, paesaggio
e tradizione convivono in  silenzioso equilibrio con le alte e severe
pareti rocciose del monte S. Martino. Certo, molte cose nel corso del tempo
sono cambiate, ma nulla in fondo ha scalfito l'identità di questa oasi lecchese
dove, come decantava il noto architetto milanese Luigi Broggi, ancor oggi ""si

LA STORIA
Nel contesto di una città  alcuni luoghi costituiscono veri e propri
punti focali. Brogno, amena e silenziosa frazione di Rancio di
Lecco ai piedi del monte S. Martino, è uno di questi luoghi.
Domina la piccola frazione  la villa oggi Redaelli. Attorno a questa
dimora si è avvicendata nell'ultimo mezzo millennio una quantità indefinibile
di personaggi che furono alternativamente protagonisti o comparse di vicende
festose, gioiose e tragiche.

<p>'A Wandering Poem' is exactly what the name describes. A project born out of a spiritual journey, and a strong passion for the poetic form of the written word, the desire to merge them, and to create a work that will speak by itself.</p>
<p>The tortuous road will stretch and bend, through Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Servia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia, Greece, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and the final destination, India.</p>
<p>For each day on the road, a poem will emerge, seizing inspiration from the ride, the characters, the landscapes, the beauty of the world, human kindness, freedom.</p>
<p>Differently from the usual travel journals, this one promises to be of a more abstract nature, an emotional imprint, an heterodox description of an unorthodox trip.</p>
<p>I have set myself the challenge of forcing the search for inspiration, of forcing the act of writing, and of forcing myself through a though area of the world.</p>
<p>The objective: to come back from my trip and publish. Wandering poems accompanied by photographs, emotional postcards of the world's exoticism, the soul of the road on paper.</p>

<p>We are all wanderers, lost, in one way or the other, but we all have an undeniable emotional connection with the universe around us.

<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>I have set the fund-raising objective of 1.500€ which is the sufficient amount of funds necessary to publish my work. </div>
<div>Based on online print-on-demand services, I have made an estimation of how much it would cost me to self-publish my book, let's say printing an initial number of 200 physical copies and an e-book. </div>
<div>The trip requires no necessary additional funding, as that is already covered by the budget I have defined for those 6 months.</div>
<div>The promised perks will be :</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>For a <b>contribution of 5€</b> you will get an <b>e-book</b> in any of the common electronic book formats (ePub, AZW, LIT, PDF, ODF, Mobi), accompanied with a customized <b>postcard</b>, made with selected photos from the trip. </li>
<li>For a <b>contribution of 15€</b> you will get a <b>physical copy of the paperback book</b>, accompanied with a signature and customized dedication matching the feedback I'll have by exchanging a couple of emails with you :) I will also include a <b>postcard</b> with a selected photo from the trip.  </li>

</ul>
<div>If the goal is not reached, I will do my best to still bring to the world, at least the number of copies that were promised in the pre-order, even if that involves additional investment from my part. </div>
</div> <p>I am currently discussing and negotiating with some Portuguese publishers in order to see if I can get a publishing compromise, and some sort of publicity/marketing support from an established actor in the publishing business.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Because this project means to be original, and different from the usual travel journals, you will be helping and contributing to the birth of something freshly new and innovative.</div>
<div>If you like to read travel journals, if you like poetry, and if you're interested in following my adventure, then you meet all the requirements for being a part of this crowd-funding.</div>
<div>I am a dedicated individual, and practically every project I have ever put my hands to, has reached a conclusion (please do check my personal page to see my previous work in computer science and in music), and this project will definitely not be different.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>Of course there are some risks associated to this project, and the main one would be the feasibility of the trip. I am currently undergoing the process of acquiring all the visas, vaccines, etc. </div>
<div>Because the places I will cross are relatively unstable right now - with ISIL sweeping through Syria and Iraq moving closer to Turkey and Iran, and Pakistan in a state of civil unrest - there is definitely a probability that I will be denied passage through some of those countries. In that case, I do not intend to stop the trip, but I will try to find a work-around, to reach my next destination without putting my life in risk, of course.</div>
<div>There is also the chance of something happening to me on the road - which I find very unlikely - that would preclude me from writing and reaching the end of the project. For this eventuality, I would definitely refund all the donations, in case that the project could not be completed for some external reason. </div> <p>Finally, there is the risk of arriving home with a complete work, and not being able to find a publishing support, someone who would bet on me. For that, the contingency plan is that of self-publishing. If no publisher will support the project, I will not let my work die without seeing the light of day. I will use the raised funds, and if necessary personal funds, to make a print-on-demand, and to bring the work to your hands, as promised. </p>

</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>If you can't or don't want to contribute financially to my project, there are other ways you could help me get through with my endeavor. </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Since I will be mainly hitchhiking and couchsurfing, if you know people or have any contacts in the countries I will pass through, it would be of great value for me to have some local contacts, that I could reach in case of need.</li>
<li>You can and should help me diffuse my project, sharing it through your peers, your social networks, even your work colleagues. You can also share it through the tools provided by Indiegogo, right here on this website!</li>

<h3>What do I expect to get from this experience?</h3>
<div>Apart from producing a work of poetry and photography, there are other things that I expect to find on this journey. Of course, the cliché spiritual journey could not be defined without the phrase 'I will be looking for myself', which indeed is one of the main motivations for my trip. But apart from that, I will be moving (ideally) by hitchhiking and sleeping at people's places through couchsurfing. Why? Because apart from being much more optimized in terms of budget, there is a world of kindness and goodness waiting to be found. I believe that the majority of people in the world are truly good-hearted, and I want to test that theory with this trip. <br/>
</div>
<div>I also want to prove that it is possible to make an incredible trip with few money, given that you are ready to let go of a bit of comfort, and also, I want to demystify a bit the general idea that people have of the middle east, especially Iran and Pakistan. I believe that they are incredible countries with such a cultural richness, who unfortunately are obscured by the media, on account of their political and religious circumstances. </div>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
'A Wandering Poem' is exactly what the name describes. A project born out of a spiritual journey, and a strong passion for the poetic form of the written word, the desire to merge them, and to create a work that will speak by itself.
The tortuous road will stretch and bend, through Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Servia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia, Greece, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and the final destination, India.
For each day on the road, a poem will emerge, seizing inspiration from the ride, the characters, the landscapes, the beauty of the world, human kindness, freedom.
Differently from the usual travel journals, this one promises to be of a more abstract nature, an emotional imprint, an heterodox description of an unorthodox trip.
I have set myself the challenge of forcing the search for inspiration, of forcing the act of writing, and of forcing myself through a though area of the world.
The objective: to come back from my trip and publish. Wandering poems accompanied by photographs, emotional postcards of the world's exoticism, the soul of the road on paper.
I'm counting with your interest in my work, and with your support, to make the publishing possible, to help bring my work into the world, in electronic and physical formats.
We are all wanderers, lost, in one way or the other, but we all have an undeniable emotional connection with the universe around us. My desire is to bring the story of my trip, of my heart and of my soul, just in front of you, so that you can experience all that I will experience, so that you can travel with me through fallen empires, spice markets, desert landscapes, human faces touched by the sun, turbans, beards, immortal eyes.
Come with me on this trip, the pleasure is all mine.
   What We Need & What You Get
I have set the fund-raising objective of 1.500€ which is the sufficient amount of funds necessary to publish my work. 
Based on online print-on-demand services, I have made an estimation of how much it would cost me to self-publish my book, let's say printing an initial number of 200 physical copies and an e-book. 
The trip requires no necessary additional funding, as that is already covered by the budget I have defined for those 6 months.
The promised perks will be :


For a contribution of 5€ you will get an e-book in any of the common electronic book formats (ePub, AZW, LIT, PDF, ODF, Mobi), accompanied with a customized postcard, made with selected photos from the trip. 
For a contribution of 15€ you will get a physical copy of the paperback book, accompanied with a signature and customized dedication matching the feedback I'll have by exchanging a couple of emails with you :) I will also include a postcard with a selected photo from the trip.  
The poems will initially be written in Portuguese, and promptly translated by myself to English, for the first publishing batch. Later I plan to have them translated to French, Spanish, Italian and Greek. 

If the goal is not reached, I will do my best to still bring to the world, at least the number of copies that were promised in the pre-order, even if that involves additional investment from my part. 
 I am currently discussing and negotiating with some Portuguese publishers in order to see if I can get a publishing compromise, and some sort of publicity/marketing support from an established actor in the publishing business.


  The Impact
Because this project means to be original, and different from the usual travel journals, you will be helping and contributing to the birth of something freshly new and innovative.
If you like to read travel journals, if you like poetry, and if you're interested in following my adventure, then you meet all the requirements for being a part of this crowd-funding.
I am a dedicated individual, and practically every project I have ever put my hands to, has reached a conclusion (please do check my personal page to see my previous work in computer science and in music), and this project will definitely not be different.


  Risks & Challenges
Of course there are some risks associated to this project, and the main one would be the feasibility of the trip. I am currently undergoing the process of acquiring all the visas, vaccines, etc. 
Because the places I will cross are relatively unstable right now - with ISIL sweeping through Syria and Iraq moving closer to Turkey and Iran, and Pakistan in a state of civil unrest - there is definitely a probability that I will be denied passage through some of those countries.

<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Think of it as a social enterprise publication, a kind of <strong>fair trade for creativity</strong>: high standards based on an ethical revenue share that tries to do the right thing. </span></p>
<p class=""p3"">It’s a publication with a focus in the field of photography, featuring the work of a wide range of talent from around the world and a variety of different backgrounds, from fashion, to photojournalism, travel to landscape and portraiture and so on.</p>
<p class=""p3"">It’s a submission-based journal that aims to release 4 issues a year, where each issue has a theme and creatives are tasked with sharing their ideas for submission. Those who have their ideas accepted for publication are then supported to bring their concepts to life, in whatever way we can.</p>
<p class=""p3"">The Quarterly is about challenging, provoking thought, embracing the awesome, championing talent and above all bringing value back to creatives and their work, in our own bold way. It’s not a new idea but we kinda think it’s daring, will likely ruffle a few feathers, and put some noses out of joint—especially when creative talent is often exploited and their real value goes unrecognised and underappreciated. It’s time for a creative journal with guts and integrity.</p>
<p class=""p3""><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">HOW IT WORKS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class=""li2""><span class=""s1""><strong>Ethical:</strong> Once we cover print costs, the profit made from selling each issue will be split evenly amongst everyone involved.

</ul><ul>
<li class=""li2"">
<strong>Exposure: </strong>With a small initial print run, we can’t promise the moon. There won’t be international, Times Square levels of fame but in time, and with your support, we really believe The Quarterly can become biblically epic.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li class=""li2""><span class=""s1""><strong>Passion:</strong> The design, photography, direction and editing are all created by a community of creatives with the same passion. No egos here, just honest to goodness love for our work and a drive to do things differently.</span></li>

The website allows us to ensure the quality of work remains high and the content forever awesome.<strong><br/></strong></span></li>
</ul><ul>
<li class=""li2""><span class=""s1""><strong>Invest:</strong> To get involved, we ask, never demand, but ask contributors to invest in each issue. Not much mind you, just a bit more than the cost of each issue, which ensures that everyone is fully committed to the project.

Passion: The design, photography, direction and editing are all created by a community of creatives with the same passion. No egos here, just honest to goodness love for our work and a drive to do things differently.

THE REASON
We’ve become disillusioned with how a lot of creative magazines run things. We don’t agree with the way that some publications make money through advertising and through selling copies and at the same time not pay for the content creatives put their time and effort (and blood and sweat and tears and the odd bit of snot) into producing.
Free work doesn’t pay the bills. The promise of exposure won’t buy groceries. And putting in the gargantuan amount of time and effort into one’s work without getting anything back except the dream of getting discovered through exposure isn’t dignified. More often than not it’s an empty dream too.
From the very beginning, our goal has always been to do the right thing. Call it a philosophy, call it an ethical approach, it’s what constantly drives the Creative Book project forward.
We sat down and came up with an idea: to create a publication that recognises true talent, promises a fair share of the profits and won’t ever exploit artists. 
It’s been a defining experience, a challenging one and an incredibly rewarding one so far but there’s still so much more to do. 
Which is where we are now: with an awesome dream and a community of battle ready creatives about to start production, we need your help to get the Quarterly out into the world.

<h3>Long Story Short</h3>
<p>Hi!  My name is Beth Ragen, I am 34 years old and I currently reside in Oregon.  I grew up in Iowa, for the most part in the middle of what felt like nowhere, and went from no town, to small town, to bigger town and back again.  At the age of 29, I decided enough was enough and I left Iowa behind on a Greyhound bus headed for the Pacific Northwest. I knew in my heart my destiny waited for me here, and I am sad to say that I was wrong. </p>
<p>I have spent my entire adult life working, because thats what I was raised to do.  I had dreams of adventure when I was younger, I wanted to do and see things, but in the end the need to pay bills and be a productive adult won out.  It occured to me a few months ago that I am not where I need to be, and I made the decision to try and find it.  Home as a concept has been elusive, and I want more than anything to say that I am ""home"". </p>
<p>I have always been a bit of an artist, when I was younger I drew, up until the point where I told myself I couldn't, and then it became true.  When I was in high school I picked up a camera, and photography renewed the notion that I could be an artist of sorts, and while the camera left my hands for a while, once I picked it up again the passion renewed.  I do not consider myself a photographer, but I would like to, and part of this journey is very much about that.  When I was younger, I also wrote, and same as with drawing, along the way I told myself I couldn't, so I stopped.  I realize now that I can, and I should and that I will.</p>
<p>Once I made the decision to once again pick up and move my life, I decided to so so with more purpose than I've done before.  I am going to find out what home means to the people I know, and the people I have yet to meet.  I am going to accomplish this by hopping on a Greyhound bus, and taking my time getting to know the people in my life all over again, and hopefully a few strangers along the way.  My final destination will more than likely be somewhere in the south, so thats where I will be spending the majority of this journey.  I will hit as many places as I can, spending time with friends, family and strangers living their lives and finding out what home means to them and why they are where they are.  I will record this trip via photographs, some moving pictures and through the written word.  When it is all said and done, I will write a book and will hopefully have a better idea what home is, even if I haven't found mine yet.

<h3>Help me if you can!</h3>
<p>What I am asking for and why I need it. I am trying to raise 5,000 buckarinos, below is a breakdown of what I am going to use the funding for:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1200 to $1500 for a new camera and gear: I have outgrown my current equipment, and it lacks a video feature. It is getting on in age and doesn't function the way it used to. It also lacks the megapixels needed to do any large scale printing, and this limits me greatly. </li>
<li>$1000 for bus fare:  Added to what I am currently saving, this will proivde me with at least 10 additional stops on my journey, giving me a greater range of people experiences. </li>
<li>$1000 to self publish: Based on what I have researched, this seems to be the minium I'll need to get the job done right and get this out there.</li>
<li>$500 to help keep me fed on the road: While I will be staying with friends and family, I cannot expect them to feed me as well.  This will provide me with the funds to help with meals and food on the road.</li>
<li>$500 for incentives: This may be a overestimating the actual cost, but I would rather be safe than sorry. Printing, shipping, postage and materials cost have been included in this estimate.</li>
<li>$500 for emergency medical situations: Planning for the worst is not always fun, but I am looking at up to three months on the road and who knows what can happen. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I have some awesome perks including correspondence from the road, prints, framed photographs and a copy of the book when all is said and done.  I have thought very hard about what I would want, and I might have gotten carried away, but I want you to feel like you are getting your money's worth! <strong>Please note that certain incentives such as prints and postcards will be available before the stated June 2014 delivery date. </strong></p>
<p>If all the funds aren't raised, I will make sure incentives are covered then put the rest towards the trip itself. I will do as much as I can with what is generously given.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What this means to me</h3>
<p>I have always lived life very purposely, but its never been my purpose.  I did the things I was supposed to, that I was raise to do.  I got a job, I took responsiblity for myself, I've taken care of others, but I've never really done anything to serve myself.  I really need to have faith in myself, to believe that I can do something other than work and be responsible.  By donating to my campaign, you have shown that you believe in me and that helps me to believe in myself. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that life happens, and we cannot always help in the ways that are asked of us, but even if you cannot contribute monetarily, if you have faith in me and this project, help spread the word:</p>

Humanity Inspired – Powered By You!</p>
<p>I have spent more than 30 years working with the homeless, raising funds for battered women shelters and helping bring better living conditions to Africa and other countries like India. I wasn’t a rich guy while I did all this – just a guy who was living Mahatma Ghandi’s advice of being the change I wished to see in the world.</p>
<p>For a long time I have wanted to write and publish a book about Little Ideas that I hope will inspire people everywhere to do little things that can have some pretty large consequences.  These Little Ideas could ripple out to the ends of our planet and enough Little Ideas can create massive impact.  The book is titled:</p>
<p>I also have a Blog on this topic:  <a href=""http://littleideascanchangetheworld.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://littleideascanchangetheworld.blogspot.com/</a></p>

<p>I also know that I am an ideas guy and I would like to invite other idea people like me to help me with this project.

This book – these Little Ideas – spread and acted upon could be what is needed to flip the switch.</p>
<p>Funding<br/>
I have wanted to act on this project for a long time but never had the time.  Now I have the time because I am suddenly unemployed but I don’t have the money.   That’s when I thought about all of you at Indiegogo and had this crazy idea that maybe there were enough people out there that wanted to fuel this project; that I didn’t have to do this alone, that this didn’t have to be MY project.  I DO <span class=""caps"">NOT</span> seek glory or fame, instead my heart burns for change.</p>
<p>I want to work on this full time for the next few months or as long as the project needs me to get it to the Tipping Point.  I have chosen $28,000 as that would insure that I can focus on this project.  I know it is a lot of money but I want to do it right and I want to make sure I don’t run out of money.</p>
<p>I hope to inspire people to purchase multiple copies to give away so that we create a movement of Little Ideas, each one causing little ripples and collectively causing a Tsunami that shifts our planet into a new reality.</p>

Humanity Inspired – Powered By You!
I have spent more than 30 years working with the homeless, raising funds for battered women shelters and helping bring better living conditions to Africa and other countries like India. I wasn’t a rich guy while I did all this – just a guy who was living Mahatma Ghandi’s advice of being the change I wished to see in the world.
For a long time I have wanted to write and publish a book about Little Ideas that I hope will inspire people everywhere to do little things that can have some pretty large consequences.  These Little Ideas could ripple out to the ends of our planet and enough Little Ideas can create massive impact.  The book is titled:
I also have a Blog on this topic:  http://littleideascanchangetheworld.blogspot.com/

<h3></h3>
<p>There’s
more to Nashville’s arts scene these days than just country music – the message
of popular TV shows notwithstanding. Nashville is home to one of America’s best
regional orchestras (a seven-time Grammy winner), fabulous art museums and
galleries, adventurous opera, hard-bopping jazz, fun and thought-provoking
theater, and lots more. It’s an exhilarating arts scene, to be sure, and it definitely
demands serious journalistic attention. </p>
<p><a href=""http://artsnash.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ArtsNash</a> was founded in
the spring of 2012 for that very purpose. The mission of this nonprofit
journalism company is to provide comprehensive coverage of Nashville’s thriving
arts scene, posting on our website the sorts of high-quality professional
reviews that used to be found in daily newspapers. ArtsNash publishes the work
of some of Music City’s finest reviewers, including former<i> Tennessean</i> critic Evans Donnell (theater, opera, film) and
long-time <i>Nashville Scene</i> scribes Joe
Nolan (visual arts), John Pitcher (classical music, dance) and Ron Wynn (jazz).
</p>
<p>During
its first season of operation, ArtsNash posted over 400 reviews, and the
website received more than 100,000 unique visits.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>ArtsNash
is providing an important public service. The website is the only professional
journalism organization in the city that routinely reviews the concerts of the
Grammy Award-winning Nashville Symphony. ArtsNash was also the only media
outlet to review such recent performances as the world premiere of Nashville
Ballet’s <a href=""http://artsnash.com/dance/peter-pan-review/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Peter Pan”</a> and Nashville Opera’s <a href=""http://artsnash.com/classicalmusic/review-pearl-fishers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“The Pearl Fishers.”</a></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>ArtsNash’s
reviews are all being stored in an online <a href=""http://artsnash.com/archives/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">archive</a>, which is already beginning to
constitute the most important historical record of Nashville’s vibrant arts
scene in the early 21<sup>st</sup> century. </p>
<p>In
addition, the site has established important regional and national partnerships
with such noted groups as <a href=""http://www.nowplayingnashville.com/home4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NowPlayingNashville</a> (Nashville’s
premier online calendar), <a href=""http://www.artsatl.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ArtsATL</a> (Atlanta’s
terrific online arts journal) and the delightfully provocative <a href=""http://www.clydefitchreport.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Clyde Fitch Report</a>. Since ArtsNash
is committed to the long-term success of the arts, it has also established an
internship program to train the next generation of arts journalists. </p>
<p>The
success of ArtsNash during its first season has allowed us to market a few ads
on our home page, bringing in a small amount of money to help defray expenses
while providing other nonprofits with an inexpensive means to market their important
endeavors. What the ad money does not do, however, is provide ArtsNash with the
funds it needs to pay its writers, who up to now have all donated their
services. ArtsNash is a nonprofit (we are incorporated in Tennessee and our
application for federal tax exempt status is pending), and just like public
television and public radio we depend on the support and generosity of the
public for our survival. That’s why we’re launching this Indiegogo campaign to
raise <b>$5,000.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>What
will the money be used for? All of it (100 percent) will be used to send our
professional writers an embarrassingly small check for each of their reviews.
That’s the least that we can do, given the substantial amount of time the
writers devote to each piece. The <b>$5,000</b>
would enable us to pay the writers during the winter and early spring of 2014. On Monday, Dec. 2, 2013, we received a letter from the IRS that approved our August 2012 application for tax-exempt status under Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code, so your contribution is tax deductible under Section 170 of the code.</p>
<p>What
will you get besides the option of that deduction? In the larger sense
you can feel that you're aiding the cultural life of our community by
encouraging serious professional coverage of the local arts scene. This is
critical at a time when studies have shown <a href=""http://www.najp.org/publications/conferencereports/rtaIIentire.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">that while journalism coverage of the arts has steadily
declined, participation in the arts by members of  the public has steadily increased</a>. The arts matter to more
and more of our citizens yet the information they need is coming more
frequently from less reliable sources – much of it now amounting to little more
than 140-character shout outs. Don’t get us wrong. We love Twitter and use it
all the time. But great art doesn’t always lend itself  to analysis by haiku. Good criticism provides
us with a template on how to remember and appreciate the great art that we see
and hear. And it makes that art unforgettable in every sense of that word. With
your help ArtsNash wants to give the region’s arts scene the sort of serious professional
attention it deserves. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>We
know not everyone can contribute money at this time. You can help by spreading
the word, however: send people to our <a href=""http://artsnash.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>, refer them to our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ArtsNash?ref=hl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook

ORIGINAL CAMPAIGN DESCRIPTION:


 

I’m going to Kenya to complete my novel
– and I need your help!

 
My name is David Hallock Sanders. I live in Philadelphia, and I'm writing a novel that's set in the mountain rainforest of western Kenya, where I lived as a child.

 
I’m turning to IndieGoGo to help me get back to Kenya in December for a writing seminar in Nairobi and a return to my old home at Kaimosi Quaker Mission for writing and research – all part of completing my novel in 2012.

 
Why Africa?


 
In the mid-1960s I lived in Kenya at a Quaker mission located right on the equator, but high in the mountain jungle. This was just after Kenyan independence, and my parents were training teachers for the nation's new education system. 

That's me in the small photo at top, standing outside the mission school with some of my classmates.

 
Forty-five years later I'm now writing a novel set in a similar, although fictional, location in Kenya during the mid-sixties. The novel's working title is Busara Road, and it's something of a coming-of-age story for both the main character and the young Kenyan nation. I'm now closing in on a first draft of the novel, helped by several writing residencies at the Pendle Hill Quaker Center and the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts.

 
Recently I was accepted for a very exciting writing program in Africa called SLS Kenya. In December I will spend several weeks in Nairobi and Lamu working with some top African writers as well as novelist Gary Shteyngart.

 
Following the seminar I will travel on my own to western Kenya for more writing and research to complete the novel, as well as for a personal homecoming at the Quaker mission where I lived as a child. It will be my first time back since I was a boy.

 
What your support will fund


 
The total cost of this trip will be about $8,000, even with a tuition prize I won in the SLS International Fiction Competition. It's a daunting amount. About $3,000 of that is for the SLS program fees and the cost of returning to Kaimosi Quaker Mission. The rest is for travel, accommodations, food, supplies, etc..

 
My goal for IndieGoGo is $3,000 to help meet the expenses for the writing program and mission visit.


 
If I'm fortunate enough to exceed that goal, I'll put all additional funds toward the other expenses directly related to completing this trip and the novel.

 
I believe very strongly in this novel. Excerpts from it have already won awards and been published in literary journals and anthologies. Now I invite you to join me in making the completed work a reality.

 
Why go to Kenya now?


 
Now is when I've been accepted to the SLS program. Now is when I've been invited to return to Kaimosi Quaker Mission. And most of all, now is when this trip can most benefit the completion of my novel.

 
I'm at a pivotal moment in my writing career. I've had some successes, including publications, awards, and having my work produced for stage and public radio.

But now I am eager to complete my first novel for publication, and this trip to Kenya will enable me to do exactly that.

 
Your support means everything to me
 
This trip to Kenya will be a crucial catalyst for completing and revising my novel for publication. I would love it if you were able to support this project. Your contribution, right now, however big or small, is very important to reaching my goal. It's easy to do. To back this project just click on ""Contribute Now"" and pick an amount. You'll see up there on the right some fun perks I'm offering to say thanks for your contribution.

 
I'd also love it if you could spread the word about this project to anyone you think might be interested, by ""liking"" this site and creating links to it through Facebook, Twitter, emails, and embedding it in your own website, or connecting in any other way you think would be helpful. It's easy to do by using IndieGoGo's share tools. 

And please leave me a comment (or lots of comments!) on my Comments tab to let me know what you think.

 
Thank you!


 
Even if you can't afford to contribute, I really appreciate this opportunity to share with you a project I'm very excited about. I'll be posting updates on the project at IndieGoGo.com, as well as on my own site, BusaraBlog.com – so check those out; and share your thoughts on my Comments tab.

<p><b>What is <i>Mother of Creation?</i></b></p>
<p><i>Mother of Creation</i> is soon to be my second self-published book, but I need
your help to make it happen! It is an epic fantasy novel full of dark twists
and turns, the story of a king and his lover, a princess and her twin, a faithful
guard, a blind seer, and the isolated, manipulated child of a god. </p>
<p><b>Where's Your Money Going?</b></p>
<p>Publishing a book well actually involves a lot of
elements, and all of those elements cost money. I did my last book on a super
shoe-string budget of $300, and was honestly not completely happy with the
results. This time, my goal is to produce a better quality product with a wider
buying pool.</p>
<p>So, how am I going to do that?</p>
<p>First of all, I want to hire a copyeditor. Copyeditors are
pretty expensive - right now my rough estimate on this is around $500 minimum.
They are expensive because of what they do. A copyeditor goes through your work
not only for grammatical errors and inconsistencies like a proofreader does,
but also for story inconsistencies and plot reworkings. Needless to say this
can be a pretty time-consuming project, which is why they charge so much.
Still, the quality of one's work at the end tends to be a bit better when a

Last time, I got a great cover from Design for Writers for under $300. However,

form. Many of my readers have expressed interest in that format being made

commissioning a cover that can be used for print books! That's going to cost
roughly $400 by my estimate.</p>

Mother of Creation is soon to be my second self-published book, but I need
your help to make it happen! It is an epic fantasy novel full of dark twists
and turns, the story of a king and his lover, a princess and her twin, a faithful
guard, a blind seer, and the isolated, manipulated child of a god. 
Where's Your Money Going?
Publishing a book well actually involves a lot of
elements, and all of those elements cost money. I did my last book on a super
shoe-string budget of $300, and was honestly not completely happy with the
results. This time, my goal is to produce a better quality product with a wider
buying pool.
So, how am I going to do that?
First of all, I want to hire a copyeditor. Copyeditors are
pretty expensive - right now my rough estimate on this is around $500 minimum.
They are expensive because of what they do. A copyeditor goes through your work
not only for grammatical errors and inconsistencies like a proofreader does,
but also for story inconsistencies and plot reworkings. Needless to say this
can be a pretty time-consuming project, which is why they charge so much.
Still, the quality of one's work at the end tends to be a bit better when a
third party has done a deep dive into its flaws.

(this is the section where I am to build trust with you, my potential audience). Good, nailed that.<br/><br/>Basically, I have been a (mostly) vegetarian for over 15 years, and was raised with a health consciousness that I have continued to develop. I recently completed my Health Coaching Certification, started a Counseling business and website (<a href=""http://www.andreakampicwellness.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">andreakampicwellness.com</a>) and am putting it all together with this first volume in a Series of Health Books. <b><i>The Skinny on Eating Plants, A Why and How Manual</i> </b>is written and I would like to raise funds to punch it up and publish it. This book outlines the value of a plant-based diet for the health of the animals involved (including us), the health of our planet, and how to make it happen in practice. The second book in this Series, on Detoxing and Cleansing, is underway, and I will begin working on it more diligently once I get this first monkey off my back. Just kidding, it has been a joy. I'm joyful. <br/><br/>Anyway, <i>The Skinny</i> Series is a compendium of multiple books on health that are thin (this one is around 135 pages, but dense, think: steel), and a play on words because if you eat a plant-based diet (or follow along with the advice in any of the the issues of <i>The Skinny</i> Series), you will get skinnier. Oh, and skinny also means information, so it's triple-entendred.<br/><br/>While I may joke around, I am actually very serious about health. I truly believe that prevention is the healthcare of the future, and we are all in this together. <b>Awareness + Education + Support = Change</b>. However, nothing will truly change in terms of our general wellness until we accept that our system is all upside down--we spend inordinate amounts of money treating chronic diseases once they have developed that often could have been prevented with proper, responsible individual decision-making and honest education. One important way to achieve this that has been scientifically proven is to eat less animal products and more plants. I want to help you discover this based on what I have learned from a <b>lifetime of growing</b> <b>Awareness and Education</b>. <b>If you be my Support, together we can Equal Change</b>. <br/><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>I'm seeking $2500 to create a polished book from my current manuscript. The general time frame of this first book project is to get the ball rolling while this Indiegogo campaign is running; do any rewrites, proof &amp; edit the text and design the book cover by July 1; have the book available on Amazon by end of Julyish; ship your copies and perks around that same timeish. I will use the proceeds from this campaign and any book sales to fund the future books in this series, so have no fear that this will be an ongoing funds barrage. I'm not like that. And I know you. So we're good. <br/></p><p>The funds raised will go toward:</p><p>~general fees: ISBN and barcodes, copyrighting the material, Indiegogo fees (4-9% depending on how much I raise), reward fulfillment, shipping costs<br/></p><p>~publishing: editorial assistance, layout, cover design, photography, printing expenses, kindle edition formatting costs<br/></p><p>~If I raise money upfront through your kind assistance, I can reduce the price of the actual paperback copy, making it more accessible for everyone else (basically a <b>pay it forward</b> situation where you pony up for the next guy). <b>I would like these to be inexpensive, portable, thin, condensed-but-thorough guides on each topic</b>, and it is wildly more important to me to get it out there than it is to get rich. </p><p>If I do not reach my cited goal, I will still publish this volume, but it may delay the release of future books in <i>The Skinny</i> series. I will still want to help all of you stay well, but maybe a little less so. <br/></p><p>If by some crazy bit of good luck I raise more than I am seeking, forget about that last snarky comment and know that I am in this with you through thick and skinny. As stated earlier, any additional funds raised will go toward the next book in the Series, paying it forward in a healthy feedback loop.<br/></p><p><b>Please see the sidebar (over there on the right) to see what I am offering for your generous contributions.</b></p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/434570/files/20140314160204-Screen_shot_2014-03-14_at_3.49.38_PM.png?1394838124"" src="""" style=""width: 370.843px; height: 360px;""/></p><i>Random pretty, tasty-looking vegetable</i> <br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>The upshot of these books and why I feel compelled to write and distribute them is because we all know friends, family, loved ones, maybe some jerks even but they're sorry, who have serious illnesses. At this somewhat primitive stage in human development, we still don't know specifically why one person gets sick and another person doesn't. Scientists have put the percentage of the genetic component at around 30%, with the remaining 70(ish)% being environmental influences. These include lifestyle (whether you move your body, stress response, overuse, abuse, excess weight); nutrition (if you provide the proper nutrients to nourish your development while avoiding junk that adds empty, worse-than-useless calories); exposure (pesticides, preservatives, toxic chemicals, heavy metals, water quality, air quality, flame retardants, artificial colors and flavors, heavily processed foods, etc, etc.); as well as X factors of which we are still unaware. </p><p>While we may not know what we have been exposed to or when, we can control what goes into our mouths to ultimately become 'us' at the cellular level. Plants contain all of the necessary ingredients for us to thrive (elephants eat only plants as do all herbivores, and when we eat animals, the nutrients we metabolize from them were all originally from the plants that they or their prey ate). </p><p>I also love and respect animals and feel that they have a lot to teach us. So rather than eat them I would prefer that we recognize that we are as much their students as their masters. And even though we have pretty much forgotten, we are animals ourselves.<br/></p><p>There is a strong environmental component in the argument for a plant-based diet as well. Here's the skinny: the monoculture that produces the food for our industrial feedlots, and animal factory farming itself, are disastrously wasteful and polluting and water-intensive. Besides killing us softly, the meat and dairy industries are taking our very breath away (70s emotional song references). <br/></p><p>All of these issues and much more! will be touched upon in the WHY sections of <b><i>The Skinny on Eating Plants, a Why and How Manual</i></b>. The HOW sections will give you some helpful tools to limit your animal product intake--from purging your cupboards and then restocking, plant substitutions for common animal products, steps to slowly reduce animal food intake, how to identify and stop cravings, menu planning, lots of charts, helpful tips, recipe ideas, pep talks, back pats, and some references for further exploration. I had to read about 100 books to distill all of this information down, you only have to read this one (you will be somewhat less informed but it's a heck of a lot less work). </p><p><b>My intention with this and subsequent books in this Series is to set you on the path to improved health</b>, and if I succeed, you will then take the mantle further and explore these issues on your own. I hope to lead you to the trailhead after which you will hack your own trail, with a machete if necessary, and guide dogs and a sherpa, breadcrumbs and a sharp stick, all of which are there for you if you seek them out. I find these helpers when I seek guidance, and they are a growing tribe waiting for you to join in. Or you can live on the couch and watch TV and get huge and sick while burning down the rainforest and eating Bambi. Up to you. <br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>While not everyone can contribute financially to this project (okay, maybe everyone can give 5 bucks--that would be awesome if EVERYONE gave 5 bucks--but anyway), your support in other ways is equally valuable. Spread the word about this project on facebook, twitter, instagram, emails, in general conversations that you start in the supermarket line with people buying cheetos and ribs, with your doctor, the butcher, at fast food restaurants--everywhere--to raise awareness of this campaign. In true seriousness, <b>I just want people to become conscious of how their choices impact the earth and its creatures, our health and future generations</b>.

(this is the section where I am to build trust with you, my potential audience). Good, nailed that.Basically, I have been a (mostly) vegetarian for over 15 years, and was raised with a health consciousness that I have continued to develop. I recently completed my Health Coaching Certification, started a Counseling business and website (andreakampicwellness.com) and am putting it all together with this first volume in a Series of Health Books. The Skinny on Eating Plants, A Why and How Manual is written and I would like to raise funds to punch it up and publish it. This book outlines the value of a plant-based diet for the health of the animals involved (including us), the health of our planet, and how to make it happen in practice. The second book in this Series, on Detoxing and Cleansing, is underway, and I will begin working on it more diligently once I get this first monkey off my back. Just kidding, it has been a joy. I'm joyful. Anyway, The Skinny Series is a compendium of multiple books on health that are thin (this one is around 135 pages, but dense, think: steel), and a play on words because if you eat a plant-based diet (or follow along with the advice in any of the the issues of The Skinny Series), you will get skinnier. Oh, and skinny also means information, so it's triple-entendred.While I may joke around, I am actually very serious about health. I truly believe that prevention is the healthcare of the future, and we are all in this together. Awareness + Education + Support = Change. However, nothing will truly change in terms of our general wellness until we accept that our system is all upside down--we spend inordinate amounts of money treating chronic diseases once they have developed that often could have been prevented with proper, responsible individual decision-making and honest education. One important way to achieve this that has been scientifically proven is to eat less animal products and more plants. I want to help you discover this based on what I have learned from a lifetime of growing Awareness and Education. If you be my Support, together we can Equal Change. What I Need & What You GetI'm seeking $2500 to create a polished book from my current manuscript. The general time frame of this first book project is to get the ball rolling while this Indiegogo campaign is running; do any rewrites, proof & edit the text and design the book cover by July 1; have the book available on Amazon by end of Julyish; ship your copies and perks around that same timeish. I will use the proceeds from this campaign and any book sales to fund the future books in this series, so have no fear that this will be an ongoing funds barrage. I'm not like that. And I know you. So we're good. The funds raised will go toward:~general fees: ISBN and barcodes, copyrighting the material, Indiegogo fees (4-9% depending on how much I raise), reward fulfillment, shipping costs~publishing: editorial assistance, layout, cover design, photography, printing expenses, kindle edition formatting costs~If I raise money upfront through your kind assistance, I can reduce the price of the actual paperback copy, making it more accessible for everyone else (basically a pay it forward situation where you pony up for the next guy). I would like these to be inexpensive, portable, thin, condensed-but-thorough guides on each topic, and it is wildly more important to me to get it out there than it is to get rich. If I do not reach my cited goal, I will still publish this volume, but it may delay the release of future books in The Skinny series. I will still want to help all of you stay well, but maybe a little less so. If by some crazy bit of good luck I raise more than I am seeking, forget about that last snarky comment and know that I am in this with you through thick and skinny. As stated earlier, any additional funds raised will go toward the next book in the Series, paying it forward in a healthy feedback loop.Please see the sidebar (over there on the right) to see what I am offering for your generous contributions.Random pretty, tasty-looking vegetable The ImpactThe upshot of these books and why I feel compelled to write and distribute them is because we all know friends, family, loved ones, maybe some jerks even but they're sorry, who have serious illnesses. At this somewhat primitive stage in human development, we still don't know specifically why one person gets sick and another person doesn't. Scientists have put the percentage of the genetic component at around 30%, with the remaining 70(ish)% being environmental influences. These include lifestyle (whether you move your body, stress response, overuse, abuse, excess weight); nutrition (if you provide the proper nutrients to nourish your development while avoiding junk that adds empty, worse-than-useless calories); exposure (pesticides, preservatives, toxic chemicals, heavy metals, water quality, air quality, flame retardants, artificial colors and flavors, heavily processed foods, etc, etc.); as well as X factors of which we are still unaware. While we may not know what we have been exposed to or when, we can control what goes into our mouths to ultimately become 'us' at the cellular level. Plants contain all of the necessary ingredients for us to thrive (elephants eat only plants as do all herbivores, and when we eat animals, the nutrients we metabolize from them were all originally from the plants that they or their prey ate). I also love and respect animals and feel that they have a lot to teach us. So rather than eat them I would prefer that we recognize that we are as much their students as their masters. And even though we have pretty much forgotten, we are animals ourselves.There is a strong environmental component in the argument for a plant-based diet as well. Here's the skinny: the monoculture that produces the food for our industrial feedlots, and animal factory farming itself, are disastrously wasteful and polluting and water-intensive. Besides killing us softly, the meat and dairy industries are taking our very breath away (70s emotional song references). All of these issues and much more! will be touched upon in the WHY sections of The Skinny on Eating Plants, a Why and How Manual. The HOW sections will give you some helpful tools to limit your animal product intake--from purging your cupboards and then restocking, plant substitutions for common animal products, steps to slowly reduce animal food intake, how to identify and stop cravings, menu planning, lots of charts, helpful tips, recipe ideas, pep talks, back pats, and some references for further exploration. I had to read about 100 books to distill all of this information down, you only have to read this one (you will be somewhat less informed but it's a heck of a lot less work). My intention with this and subsequent books in this Series is to set you on the path to improved health, and if I succeed, you will then take the mantle further and explore these issues on your own. I hope to lead you to the trailhead after which you will hack your own trail, with a machete if necessary, and guide dogs and a sherpa, breadcrumbs and a sharp stick, all of which are there for you if you seek them out. I find these helpers when I seek guidance, and they are a growing tribe waiting for you to join in. Or you can live on the couch and watch TV and get huge and sick while burning down the rainforest and eating Bambi. Up to you. Other Ways You Can HelpWhile not everyone can contribute financially to this project (okay, maybe everyone can give 5 bucks--that would be awesome if EVERYONE gave 5 bucks--but anyway), your support in other ways is equally valuable. Spread the word about this project on facebook, twitter, instagram, emails, in general conversations that you start in the supermarket line with people buying cheetos and ribs, with your doctor, the butcher, at fast food restaurants--everywhere--to raise awareness of this campaign. In true seriousness, I just want people to become conscious of how their choices impact the earth and its creatures, our health and future generations. All the rest is mushroom gravy. Thank you everyone for your kind and loving support! Let's get this done!In closing, another delicious-looking plantPhotos: Jan Sonnenmair--Thanks Jan!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Heather and this is my story. It follows me from marrying my best friend, succeeding through an infertility struggle, to becoming a widow and ultimately a single mother. This is a journal of my life after losing the love of my life to mental illness and suicide. My hope is to help others out there who may be travelling a similar path as I am. </p>
<p>I had a rather ""normal"" life. I was 28 years old, married to a wonderful man, seven months into motherhood and following my expected career path. In one night, with the shocking discovery of my husband's death, everything changed. </p>
<p>I needed a way to heal, to grieve, to get the demons out of my head, and to make something positive from the trauma I’d been handed. That was the start of my blog… The Widow Next Door…​</p>
<p>This book is the story of that journey; a day to day journal of the raw truth of what I was living, and how I survived. </p>
<p>When I began writing my blog, I really had no idea where it would take me. I knew it was helping to get out my thoughts and feelings, and hoped it was helping others as well. The response was incredible. I was doing it! I was helping and connecting with people. It meant something to others to watch my struggles and successes. There were so many out there that could relate to my stories. It helped some just by knowing there was someone that could relate to their experiences. It helped bring awareness to something so prominent in our society, that no one ever wants to talk about.</p>
<p>By writing this book, it puts everything together, who I was before, how I survived, and where I am now. The positive impact can only grow.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Unlearning Creativity is a non-fiction book exploring vital concepts such as human connection, the transfer of knowledge, and a socially-defined concept, creativity.<br/><br/>My name is Sam Budiartho, and I am the author of Unlearning Creativity. I was inspired to write this book for two reasons. The first pertains to how the education system fails through labeling only a certain set of students as creative. Where usually these “creative” students excel at traditional art, such as painting, crafts, and music-making. Through my book, I want to showcase how everyone is creative in their specific fields. Individuals who delve in non-traditional art, such as engineering and math, are creative too. The second reason of inspiration is human connection—how learning is facilitated by engaging with those around us, even in unconventional spaces. You never know what the person behind you at the DMV knows that might benefit you. We are all walking databases with x amount of years of knowledge (x being your age). We’ve grown up through different circumstances and go through personal and unique experiences. I write about how it is important to keep an open mind when engaging with anyone and to allow yourself to delve into conversations with individuals you might usually shy away from.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your unique stance in creativity and open your mind up to unconventional connections. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the transfer of knowledge and the arts—both traditional and non-traditional in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you view everyone, no matter if they have a Bachelors degree or not, as a database that may advance your understanding of something trivial, such as tying up your hair with chopsticks, or something heavy, such as the world.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the different facets of creativity and learning through an array of individuals. I write about the weirdly enthralling conversations with my Uber driver I met twice on two separate trips, to two completely different places. I write about contrasting individuals such as a Computer Science major who fuels his creativity through a string of letters and numbers and juxtapose that with painters and their creativity. The main question I try to answer is, what is creativity’s relationship with logic? [blank] is a lot about adaptability and how you react to given circumstances. Would you fill that blank in with creativity or with logic? I think the definition works for both creativity and logic, but it will vary depending with what you attach yourself most.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are interested in understanding the facets of creativity, are a people person, are interested in pop psychology, or if you’re a creator (which is everyone in a sense).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Unlearning Creativity</h3>The book is written in six chapters, and every chapter starts with a fictional poem I’ve written. These poems are woven into the non-fictional chapters and are included to convey my creative process without further explaining myself. Show instead of tell.<br/><br/>In the introduction, I primarily talk about the transfer of knowledge and human interaction. I add personal stories about how I was enlightened by a simple, yet deep conversation with my Uber driver about the hierarchy of scale. We spoke about how ants are creatures that work toward survival but would never understand complex concepts such as humans being excited about escape rooms. Then we spoke about something less trivial and more daunting; does a higher power/deity exist that we as humans could never understand?<br/><br/>Chapter 1 pertains to how I people watch and analyze different individuals. I talk about my invisible couch named Solomon, an inspiration taken from many past psychologists such as Freud. I take Solomon wherever I go, and I analyse individuals who sit on him and explain my process of learning. Imitation. A little quirky and hard to understand at a glimpse, but it is honestly a phenomenal tool for learning from others, without their realization.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 involves the relationship with the left and right brain or logic and creativity, respectively. The chapter revolves around a computer science major from the University of Southern California and exploring his creative process through a personalized interview. The interview supports my argument that creativity is found within everyone, even those who do not create traditional art. Though social conditioning has made us believe that logic and creativity are two very different facets, I illustrate how both of these components work in coordination. Without logic, there is no creativity and vice versa.<br/><br/>Chapter 3 is primarily about diving into the unknown, referring to establishing our mental boundaries and breaking away from them. I included interviews of two very different photographers, illustrating how they excel as photographers by diving into uncomfortable situations. In the first interview, the photographer talks about his ADHD and partial dyslexia and how he utilizes perspective to control the viewers through his photography. The second photographer talks about his best friend losing a loved one. The grief and pain inspired him to preserve the emotions of his subjects—no matter how emotionally draining it may be.<br/><br/>Chapter 4 is devoted to my creative process. How I navigate the world through my creative process and how I fell in love with creating hyperrealistic charcoal drawings. It may seem to some that artists are just ""born with talent"" and are inclined to create art from a young age. This perception was not the case for me. I write about how I was forced into art classes and ""failed to succeed"" as an artist (according to my teachers) because I didn't want to follow the ""conventional rules"" of art school. In this chapter, I include photos of my drawings - most of them being deformed portraits - and explain the thought processes behind them.<br/><br/>Chapter 5 is my final chapter. I wrap everything together by writing about synesthesia and multi-hyphenates. Synesthesia is the condition that allows the brain to process several senses simultaneously. Specifically, in this chapter, I talk about my personal experience having grapheme-color synesthesia and how I see specific colors when reading or thinking about particular words. With this in mind, I talk about how my synesthesia affects my writing and creative process. Regarding the multi-hyphenate topic of the chapter, I interviewed a graduate student studying screenwriting with many different pursuits. Through this interview, I analyze how, being a multi-hyphenate himself allows him to develop memorable stories.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go toward the following:<p>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in July, 2020</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3> My name is Sam Budiartho, and my fascination for psychology began at the University of Southern California where I studied both unconventional art and anthropology, along with Marketing and UI/UX Design,as well.<br/><br/>As an individual who is enthralled with psychology, unconventional art and anthropology, I’m passionate about writing because I believe I grow through creating all forms of art. Through creating, I am able to embellish my cognitive thoughts into the material world. This book is truly my passion project, and I wish to create positive impact in a world (no matter the gravity of it).

</div></div>","Story of My Book
Unlearning Creativity is a non-fiction book exploring vital concepts such as human connection, the transfer of knowledge, and a socially-defined concept, creativity.My name is Sam Budiartho, and I am the author of Unlearning Creativity. I was inspired to write this book for two reasons. The first pertains to how the education system fails through labeling only a certain set of students as creative. Where usually these “creative” students excel at traditional art, such as painting, crafts, and music-making. Through my book, I want to showcase how everyone is creative in their specific fields. Individuals who delve in non-traditional art, such as engineering and math, are creative too. The second reason of inspiration is human connection—how learning is facilitated by engaging with those around us, even in unconventional spaces. You never know what the person behind you at the DMV knows that might benefit you. We are all walking databases with x amount of years of knowledge (x being your age). We’ve grown up through different circumstances and go through personal and unique experiences. I write about how it is important to keep an open mind when engaging with anyone and to allow yourself to delve into conversations with individuals you might usually shy away from.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your unique stance in creativity and open your mind up to unconventional connections. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the transfer of knowledge and the arts—both traditional and non-traditional in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you view everyone, no matter if they have a Bachelors degree or not, as a database that may advance your understanding of something trivial, such as tying up your hair with chopsticks, or something heavy, such as the world.In this book, you'll learn about the different facets of creativity and learning through an array of individuals. I write about the weirdly enthralling conversations with my Uber driver I met twice on two separate trips, to two completely different places. I write about contrasting individuals such as a Computer Science major who fuels his creativity through a string of letters and numbers and juxtapose that with painters and their creativity. The main question I try to answer is, what is creativity’s relationship with logic? [blank] is a lot about adaptability and how you react to given circumstances. Would you fill that blank in with creativity or with logic? I think the definition works for both creativity and logic, but it will vary depending with what you attach yourself most.You will love this book if you are interested in understanding the facets of creativity, are a people person, are interested in pop psychology, or if you’re a creator (which is everyone in a sense).
 
The Book - Unlearning CreativityThe book is written in six chapters, and every chapter starts with a fictional poem I’ve written. These poems are woven into the non-fictional chapters and are included to convey my creative process without further explaining myself. Show instead of tell.In the introduction, I primarily talk about the transfer of knowledge and human interaction. I add personal stories about how I was enlightened by a simple, yet deep conversation with my Uber driver about the hierarchy of scale. We spoke about how ants are creatures that work toward survival but would never understand complex concepts such as humans being excited about escape rooms. Then we spoke about something less trivial and more daunting; does a higher power/deity exist that we as humans could never understand?Chapter 1 pertains to how I people watch and analyze different individuals. I talk about my invisible couch named Solomon, an inspiration taken from many past psychologists such as Freud. I take Solomon wherever I go, and I analyse individuals who sit on him and explain my process of learning. Imitation. A little quirky and hard to understand at a glimpse, but it is honestly a phenomenal tool for learning from others, without their realization.Chapter 2 involves the relationship with the left and right brain or logic and creativity, respectively. The chapter revolves around a computer science major from the University of Southern California and exploring his creative process through a personalized interview. The interview supports my argument that creativity is found within everyone, even those who do not create traditional art. Though social conditioning has made us believe that logic and creativity are two very different facets, I illustrate how both of these components work in coordination. Without logic, there is no creativity and vice versa.Chapter 3 is primarily about diving into the unknown, referring to establishing our mental boundaries and breaking away from them. I included interviews of two very different photographers, illustrating how they excel as photographers by diving into uncomfortable situations. In the first interview, the photographer talks about his ADHD and partial dyslexia and how he utilizes perspective to control the viewers through his photography. The second photographer talks about his best friend losing a loved one. The grief and pain inspired him to preserve the emotions of his subjects—no matter how emotionally draining it may be.Chapter 4 is devoted to my creative process. How I navigate the world through my creative process and how I fell in love with creating hyperrealistic charcoal drawings. It may seem to some that artists are just ""born with talent"" and are inclined to create art from a young age. This perception was not the case for me. I write about how I was forced into art classes and ""failed to succeed"" as an artist (according to my teachers) because I didn't want to follow the ""conventional rules"" of art school. In this chapter, I include photos of my drawings - most of them being deformed portraits - and explain the thought processes behind them.Chapter 5 is my final chapter. I wrap everything together by writing about synesthesia and multi-hyphenates. Synesthesia is the condition that allows the brain to process several senses simultaneously. Specifically, in this chapter, I talk about my personal experience having grapheme-color synesthesia and how I see specific colors when reading or thinking about particular words. With this in mind, I talk about how my synesthesia affects my writing and creative process. Regarding the multi-hyphenate topic of the chapter, I interviewed a graduate student studying screenwriting with many different pursuits. Through this interview, I analyze how, being a multi-hyphenate himself allows him to develop memorable stories. What I Need & What You'll Get This book will be published with New Degree Press.

About the Author My name is Sam Budiartho, and my fascination for psychology began at the University of Southern California where I studied both unconventional art and anthropology, along with Marketing and UI/UX Design,as well.As an individual who is enthralled with psychology, unconventional art and anthropology, I’m passionate about writing because I believe I grow through creating all forms of art. Through creating, I am able to embellish my cognitive thoughts into the material world. This book is truly my passion project, and I wish to create positive impact in a world (no matter the gravity of it). My hope for the book is for communities to strive to be closer and for people to connect with one another. On the other hand, I’m curious about the intersection of creativity and logic and how the two relate to one another. Through my book, I’m trying to break through the social confinements of what creativity is, to allow everyone to realize that creativity resonates within them.Coming from an international background, I sometimes feel out of place with my identity.

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<p>Fooling Sheep is a book about a modern day Turing Test, where coming-of-age meets a psychological AI simulation. It’s a mystery about high schoolers discovering the true nature of themselves and everyone around them, all in an attempt to figure out the identity of the humanoid robot in their lives.<br/><br/>My name is Simone Lamont and I am the author of Fooling Sheep. I wrote this book because I wanted to combine my love for science fiction with my own life experiences growing up, and I wanted to write a story of technology that hasn’t been told before. You don’t often get the artificial intelligence thriller genre in young adult fiction books, much less in a high school environment, and yet I think it’s the perfect place to explore those themes.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover unconventional friendships, suspenseful sci-fi grounded in reality, and a story about developing your personal identity. At it’s core this is a book about human connection in its most experimental form.</p>
<p>The book follows Olivia, the new kid at Park Falls high school. It’s a high school that’s participating in an artificial intelligence simulation where a humanoid robot is anonymously placed among the students. Olivia just wants to fit in with her peers, but even she can’t resist the hunt for the identity of the robot among them. After an unexpected death and a series of impossible coincidences, Olivia and her new friends begin to doubt the authenticity of each other and their own lives.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you enjoy science fiction thrillers like Ex Machina and Westworld, or if you’re looking for a suspenseful young adult story that will constantly keep you guessing.<br/><br/>Fooling Sheep speaks to high school and college students who are growing up in this age of technology and learning how to be adults in a world where the lines between our image and our own identities are blurred.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Fooling Sheep inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does it mean to be human in a world where we’re constantly creating new versions of ourselves?</li>
<li>Do we really know where we fit into the constructs of our society, or are we just learning to play a role and imitating those around us?</li>
<li>What is our generation’s greatest fears about technology and the advancement of AI? How are these fears different from the fears of people in generations before us?</li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing these subjects of our future generations will change us all for the better.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Story of <i>Cacophony</i>
</h2>
<p><i>What are some noises that are drowning out your heart?</i><br/><br/><i>Cacophony </i>is the first novel in a series that explores empathy through the lens of minorities in the US and in China. Juxtaposing the lives of people with insanely different backgrounds, I tried to craft a story that means so much more than me. It's humanity. It's, in my language, 人之常情. </p>
<p>Dolkar is a survivor of human trafficking- her story is wild but she is resilient. Arno is someone who has been through hell and is back again, serving this world more than anyone ever thought possible. They are met with questions such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>Is my service to others for my own sanity and ego or is it really out of deep conviction? Are they separable? </li>
<li>How is it possible to forgive<i> them </i>when I can't even begin to forgive myself? </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Idalia is an Asian-American whose first love and career direct her towards these moments of awareness that bring her face to face with universal questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do I want? What do I really want? What have I been taught to want? How do I separate that from what I really want?</li>
<li>How far should authenticity go before it becomes rude?</li>
<li>How far should I go to chase my heart when it’s been ingrained in my values to respect the shoulders upon which I stand on? Why can’t I have both? Can I make it so I have both?</li>
<li>Is he really the one I love or did I take his image and craft an ideal I want?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Ruby Wei, and I am the author of<i> Cacophony</i>. I wrote this book because I <i>just</i> couldn’t get this story out of my head. It’s as if it has a life of its own, and all I did was engage with it throughout these past few months. The best I could do for you is to type it out and gift it to you, a time capsule of my entire heart and essence. Here, I didn’t hold anything back.</p>
<p>You will enjoy this book if you love a good story at the end of a long work or school week to carry you away (John Mayer anyone?) from everything grappling with your peace of mind. I have the book, you got the wine? (or get the wine bundle and I'll have the wine <i>and</i> the book for you) </p>
<p>My sincere hope is that, after reading Cacophony, you’ll embark on the same journey I think we should all be on: to understand before we reply, to empathize before we ostracize, to learn before we judge, to love deeply, to dream wildly, to live- the best way we know how. To be kind- to ourselves as well as to everyone else.</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Ruby Wei is a student at Texas A&amp;M University who will be graduating in May 2022 with a bachelor’s in Finance and a focus in Nonprofit and Social Innovation.<br/><br/><i>Cacophony</i> came out of a place of feeling like she’s taken too much from the world and haven’t given anything back. Jokes on her, she went to an extreme and ended up giving everything back. Her whole self. Her whole heart. Everything she’s in love with, spelled out right there in front of you. Yet more than anything, she wanted to learn more about the ideas she touches on in her novel and to take her readers on a similar journey of learning. This book consists of more than just <i>her</i>- it's the voice of an Asian-American battling the invisibility of her people in America. Invisibility carves out space for bias, which catapults into hate, erupting into violence- this is her speaking, not just as herself, but as part of this Asian American legacy. <br/><br/>Outside of her love for literature, you can catch Ruby wandering somewhere she thought she would be but ended up getting lost at. Seriously, this girl has the direction sense of a rock- if not worse. A rock wouldn’t go so far as to tell you the <i>wrong</i> direction. Travel with her; would you dare? She also has this thing for all action films- Jackie Chan and Marvel, especially.</p>

What are some noises that are drowning out your heart?Cacophony is the first novel in a series that explores empathy through the lens of minorities in the US and in China. Juxtaposing the lives of people with insanely different backgrounds, I tried to craft a story that means so much more than me. It's humanity. It's, in my language, 人之常情. 
Dolkar is a survivor of human trafficking- her story is wild but she is resilient. Arno is someone who has been through hell and is back again, serving this world more than anyone ever thought possible. They are met with questions such as: 

Is my service to others for my own sanity and ego or is it really out of deep conviction? Are they separable? 
How is it possible to forgive them when I can't even begin to forgive myself? 

 
Idalia is an Asian-American whose first love and career direct her towards these moments of awareness that bring her face to face with universal questions such as:

What do I want? What do I really want? What have I been taught to want? How do I separate that from what I really want?
How far should authenticity go before it becomes rude?
How far should I go to chase my heart when it’s been ingrained in my values to respect the shoulders upon which I stand on? Why can’t I have both? Can I make it so I have both?
Is he really the one I love or did I take his image and craft an ideal I want?

 
My name is Ruby Wei, and I am the author of Cacophony. I wrote this book because I just couldn’t get this story out of my head. It’s as if it has a life of its own, and all I did was engage with it throughout these past few months. The best I could do for you is to type it out and gift it to you, a time capsule of my entire heart and essence. Here, I didn’t hold anything back.
You will enjoy this book if you love a good story at the end of a long work or school week to carry you away (John Mayer anyone?) from everything grappling with your peace of mind. I have the book, you got the wine? (or get the wine bundle and I'll have the wine and the book for you) 
My sincere hope is that, after reading Cacophony, you’ll embark on the same journey I think we should all be on: to understand before we reply, to empathize before we ostracize, to learn before we judge, to love deeply, to dream wildly, to live- the best way we know how. To be kind- to ourselves as well as to everyone else.

About the Author
Ruby Wei is a student at Texas A&M University who will be graduating in May 2022 with a bachelor’s in Finance and a focus in Nonprofit and Social Innovation.Cacophony came out of a place of feeling like she’s taken too much from the world and haven’t given anything back. Jokes on her, she went to an extreme and ended up giving everything back. Her whole self. Her whole heart. Everything she’s in love with, spelled out right there in front of you. Yet more than anything, she wanted to learn more about the ideas she touches on in her novel and to take her readers on a similar journey of learning. This book consists of more than just her- it's the voice of an Asian-American battling the invisibility of her people in America. Invisibility carves out space for bias, which catapults into hate, erupting into violence- this is her speaking, not just as herself, but as part of this Asian American legacy. Outside of her love for literature, you can catch Ruby wandering somewhere she thought she would be but ended up getting lost at. Seriously, this girl has the direction sense of a rock- if not worse. A rock wouldn’t go so far as to tell you the wrong direction. Travel with her; would you dare? She also has this thing for all action films- Jackie Chan and Marvel, especially.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Letters To My Brown Mother</i> is about the struggles with mental health in the South Asian (desi) diaspora. The book details experiences of everyday South Asian immigrants and children of immigrants.<br/><br/>My name is Muzna Abbas and I am the author of <i>Letters To My Brown Mother</i>. I wrote this book in hopes to dismantle the stigma surrounding mental health in the South Asian community. Mental wellbeing is rarely prioritized or discussed in South Asian households, causing many to suffer in silence without any help and support. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the necessity of discussing and understanding the nuances of this stigma. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn how mental health and culture interact. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you prioritize your mental health and have the difficult (but very important) conversation about this topic with your family and the broader diaspora community. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of toxic masculinity, patriarchal gender norms, and the immigrant experience through letters like:<ul>
<li>
<u><strong>Log Kya Kahenge (What will people say?):</strong></u> A story about the impact of placing immense value on image and society’s opinion of how to live your life.</li>
<li>
<u><strong>Poster Child:</strong></u> Describing the mental health and identity crises we face while balancing being children of immigrants and ‘third-culture kids.’</li>
<li>
<u><strong>Family Heirlooms:</strong></u> This letter details the consequences of daughters carrying the burden of family honor.</li>
</ul>You will love this book if you are interested in learning about how cultural factors make prioritizing mental health taboo. While this book discusses the experiences of South Asian immigrants, many of these stories apply to all immigrant communities.<br/><br/><i>Letters To My Brown Mother</i> speaks to the immigrant generation, to give them insight on their children’s struggles with mental health. The book is equally for us, their children, to give us a platform and the space to heal. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Letters To My Brown Mother inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>How is my mental health affected by my experiences as a South Asian immigrant?</li>
<li>How can I have the difficult conversation about mental health with my family and community?</li>
<li>What is needed to dismantle the stigma towards mental health in our communities?</li>
<li><strong>How can we be better for our future generations?</strong></li>
</ul>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing mental heath and the South Asian approach to dealing with it (or not dealing with it) will change us all for the better. <br/> <h2>The Book - Letters To My Brown Mother</h2>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapter 1. This includes a brief history of South Asian immigration and culture as well as an overview of mental health conditions. The psychology is important to break down, especially because it is the least understood in our communities. <br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 2-10. Here you will find a series of letters based-off of real stories from South Asian Americans around the United States. The letters discuss the many issues our generation has faced. Each chapter will cover a cultural theme or phenomena that either negatively affects mental health in desi communities or further deepens the stigma towards it. Among these are: color-ism, internalized racism, toxic masculinity, misogynistic gender roles, and more. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 11-15 and discusses how we can protect our mental health and move forward. I present several strategies recommended and studied by medical professionals, some that I have used. This last part of the book also details how we can have the difficult conversation about mental health with our loved ones. Having these discussions is not only another mechanism to take care of our mental health, but it is also an opportunity for us to break the stigma</p>

<br/>Much love and pyaar,<br/>Muzna Abbas</h3><h3> </h3></div>","Story of My Book
Letters To My Brown Mother is about the struggles with mental health in the South Asian (desi) diaspora. The book details experiences of everyday South Asian immigrants and children of immigrants.My name is Muzna Abbas and I am the author of Letters To My Brown Mother. I wrote this book in hopes to dismantle the stigma surrounding mental health in the South Asian community. Mental wellbeing is rarely prioritized or discussed in South Asian households, causing many to suffer in silence without any help and support. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the necessity of discussing and understanding the nuances of this stigma. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn how mental health and culture interact. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you prioritize your mental health and have the difficult (but very important) conversation about this topic with your family and the broader diaspora community. In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of toxic masculinity, patriarchal gender norms, and the immigrant experience through letters like:

Log Kya Kahenge (What will people say?): A story about the impact of placing immense value on image and society’s opinion of how to live your life.

Poster Child: Describing the mental health and identity crises we face while balancing being children of immigrants and ‘third-culture kids.’

Family Heirlooms: This letter details the consequences of daughters carrying the burden of family honor.
You will love this book if you are interested in learning about how cultural factors make prioritizing mental health taboo. While this book discusses the experiences of South Asian immigrants, many of these stories apply to all immigrant communities.Letters To My Brown Mother speaks to the immigrant generation, to give them insight on their children’s struggles with mental health. The book is equally for us, their children, to give us a platform and the space to heal. Ultimately, I hope that Letters To My Brown Mother inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:
How is my mental health affected by my experiences as a South Asian immigrant?
How can I have the difficult conversation about mental health with my family and community?
What is needed to dismantle the stigma towards mental health in our communities?
How can we be better for our future generations?
I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing mental heath and the South Asian approach to dealing with it (or not dealing with it) will change us all for the better.  The Book - Letters To My Brown Mother
The book is written in 3 parts.
Part 1 contains the introduction + chapter 1. This includes a brief history of South Asian immigration and culture as well as an overview of mental health conditions. The psychology is important to break down, especially because it is the least understood in our communities. Part 2 contains chapters 2-10. Here you will find a series of letters based-off of real stories from South Asian Americans around the United States. The letters discuss the many issues our generation has faced. Each chapter will cover a cultural theme or phenomena that either negatively affects mental health in desi communities or further deepens the stigma towards it. Among these are: color-ism, internalized racism, toxic masculinity, misogynistic gender roles, and more. Part 3 contains chapters 11-15 and discusses how we can protect our mental health and move forward. I present several strategies recommended and studied by medical professionals, some that I have used. This last part of the book also details how we can have the difficult conversation about mental health with our loved ones. Having these discussions is not only another mechanism to take care of our mental health, but it is also an opportunity for us to break the stigma

I look at where they came from, what inspired them, what challenged them, and how they overcame those challenges to become the first women to achieve each position or distinction in the world of casinos and gaming.<br/><br/>My name is Jennifer Gaynor and I am the author of That (Expletive) Broad: Women Who Broke Barriers in the Casino and Gaming Industry. I wrote this book because after 15 years working as a casino and gaming industry attorney, I realized that all of the history I'd learned about the industry centers on men. Men like Sheldon Adelson, Bob Stupack, Oscar Goodman, Benny Binion, Steve Wynn, and even the “wise guys” from the city’s mafia heyday, such as Tony Spilotro and Frank “Lefty” Rosenthal--made famous in the movie <i>Casino</i>.<br/><br/>No doubt, these men played pivotal roles in creating the casino and gaming industry as we know and love it today. But what about the women? Surely there were women involved in the birth and growth of the gaming industry. But who were they? What were their stories? I was compelled to find out.<br/><br/>It might surprise you to learn that women have actually played a major role in the gambling industry from its earliest days--as gamblers, dealers, and even gaming establishment owners. In fact, some of Las Vegas’s first and most historic casinos were owned and run by women. Women have even been managers and executives at major gaming companies as well as the regulators shaping the future of the industry. The more I started to research these women, the more inspired I became, and this book was born.<br/><br/>I hope you'll agree with me that the stories of these women are fascinating and entertaining reads in their own right. They give you a unique perspective into the history of Las Vegas and the gaming and casino industry. You get to see this history through the eyes and experience of the women who were there.<br/><br/>These stories are also a must for readers who would like to be inspired by true stories of women who have broken barriers in what is very much a “man’s industry.”<br/><br/>Finally, by looking at the entire journey of the life and careers of these women--not just specific moments or a list of their achievements--this book provides an instructive first-hand look into how ground-breakers are created.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be inspired, as I have been, by these women (our ""Broads"") and their stories. Just how did each rise to the top in the “man’s world” of casinos and gaming? Although the journey of each woman is very different, they all share certain traits and behaviors that make them exceptional. These women are curious, resilient, and risk-taking. They are all exceptionally hard-working. And they are brave in their willingness to be the first, even when their presence as a woman was not always welcome.<br/><br/><u>That (Expletive) Broad is Written in Three Parts.</u><br/><br/>Part [1] contains the Introduction + Chapter 1, which looks at the history of the casino and gaming industry. We dive into how the role of women in the industry has evolved from the early days of gambling in the U.S., asking the question: Is it still a “man’s world?”<br/><br/>Part [2] contains Chapters 2 - 7. These chapters look at the overarching themes we see in the journey of our Broads, the decisions they made, the challenges they faced, and the traits that helped them to become ""firsts"" in the industry. For example, one of the most impactful lessons I’ve learned from these ground-breaking women is the fact that, for most, their paths to success were winding, rambling, and even, in some cases, had “U-turns,” pauses, or backwards steps along the way. This absolutely turned everything I thought I knew about how to achieve success on its head.<br/><br/>I also learned that our Broads did not find their success by playing “queen of the hill” and fighting off all other would-be female challengers for the one spot at the top. Instead, they found not only great personal satisfaction but also career success through doing the opposite--by helping other women rise along with them. I'm hoping this book will help to change the conventional wisdom about women helping other women in the workforce. Today, the new conventional wisdom should be that “real women, successful women, help other women to come up.”<br/><br/>Part [3] contains Chapters 8 - 11. This is my favorite part of the book, where I get to share the incredible stories of these amazing women.</p><p><br/>For example:</p><p>You'll meet card players and dealers from the Wild West, women such as Lottie Deno and Poker Alice, who tangled with infamous men such as Doc Holliday, Jessee James, and Wyatt Earp.</p><p>You'll meet women like Shirley Brancucci: a cocktail server and cards dealer on the Las Vegas Strip during the 1970s and early 1980s, when the mafia ran things in a rough and tumble manner that mirrored, in many ways, the Wild West.</p><p>You'll read the almost-unbelievable tale of Claudine Williams, a high-school dropout who became one of the first women to own and run a casino on the Las Vegas Strip.</p><p>You'll be inspired by Sarann Knight Preddy, who went from a keno writer and blackjack dealer in the after-hours clubs on Las Vegas’s segregated Westside during the 1950s to become the first African-American woman to obtain a gaming license in Nevada.</p><p>You'll also learn the story of Debra Nutton, the inspiration for the working title of this book. Back in the 1970s and 1980s, when she started working on the floor in Las Vegas casinos, her presence, at least in her positions as dealer and pit boss, was not welcomed by her male peers. In fact, they would often refer to her as “that (expletive) broad.” I’m sure they didn’t mean that as a compliment. But I love it. I hope that this book inspires you, as it has inspired me, to take that risk, to do that thing that you want to do but are scared to do. To be “that (expletive) broad.”</p><p><br/><u>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</u></p><p><br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

The large conference room in a well-appointed hotel on the Northern California coast was filled with gaming regulators and attorneys who were in-house with large gaming companies or, like me, in private practice serving clients who are in the casino or gaming industry.<br/><br/>As any bored conference attendee does in the morning while waiting for the conference to begin, I sipped tea and flipped through the overview of speakers and panelists for the day. I noticed immediately that almost all of the presenters were exclusively male. This really struck me. I wondered why, in this day and age, when there are so many amazing women in our industry, that was the case.<br/><br/>I thought to myself, “Well, some things never change.” But then, looking around the room, I saw a number of very powerful women in the audience--women who are leaders in the industry--and I realized that things are changing (despite the lack of diversity in the speaker lineup). I also realized just how much these women meant to me--as role models, friends and mentors--and I wanted to shine a spotlight on them. Not only did I want to highlight the women who have inspired or guided me in my own life and career, but also those who came before and have paved the way for the women in that room, and those yet to come and make their mark.<br/><br/>I decided at that moment that I would make sure that these women are not overlooked when the history of casinos and gaming is written. I wanted to record their stories and make sure they are remembered.

<h3>It's Been a Long Time Coming (Background to our Project) </h3>
<h3>(لقد مر وقتا طويلا (خلفية المشروع الخاص بك</h3>
<p>   My name is Benjamin Raymond and I have something very dear to me I’d like to share with you, but first, a little about myself. </p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">اسمي بنيامين ريمون ولديّ شيء عزيز على قلبي أود أن أشاطركم اياه، لكن أولاً ، دعوني أخبركم قليلاً عن نفسي.</p>
<p>   I am an international educator and author from Santa Cruz, California who has been living in the wondrous city of Abu Dhabi for the past four years, and what a marvelous time it has been.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">أنا مدرس دولي ومؤلف من سانتا كروز ، كاليفورنيا ، عشت في مدينة أبو ظبي الرائعة على مدار السنوات الأربع الماضية ، وقد كان وقتا رائعا بالفعل</p>
<p>   Nevertheless, it’s time for me to leave this glorious part of the world in just four short months to return to my long-lost home of California after seven years living abroad. If truth be told, it’s time for my wife and I to start a family, but we want to contribute something to you before we are gone. That’s why I am here talking to you through the miracle of the internet.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">ومع ذلك ، فقد حان الوقت لي لمغادرة هذا الجزء العظيم من العالم في غضون أربعة أشهر فقط للعودة إلى منزلي الذى افتقدته في كاليفورنيا بعد سبع سنوات من العيش في الخارج.لكى اكون صادقا ، لقد حان الوقت لزوجتي وأنا لبدء عائلة ، لكننا نريد أن نقدم لكم شيئًا ما قبل مغادرتنا.لهذا السبب أنا هنا أتحدث إليكم عبر معجزة الإنترنت.</p>
<p>   During my time in Abu Dhabi, I have been a poet, public speaker, and most importantly, a 7th grade teacher at the American International School. I have spent my time traveling this part of the world and experiencing new cultures and customs, but the truth is, what I will miss most is my relationships with my students.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">خلال فترة وجودي في أبو ظبي ، كنت شاعراً ومتحدثاً عاماً وقبل كل شيء مدرساً للصف السابع في المدرسة الأمريكية الدولية.لقد قضيت كل وقتي في السفر حول هذا الجزء من العالم وتجربة ثقافات وعادات جديدة ، ولكن الحقيقة هي أن أكثر ما سأفتقده هو علاقاتي مع طلابي.</p>
<p>   They have been a huge inspiration for me, encouraging me to grow, to write, and to become a better man. They have helped me redefine my understanding of what a hero is, and what it takes to inspire and change this world for the better. </p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">لقد كانوا مصدر إلهام كبيربالنسبة لي ، فقد شجعوني على النمو والكتابة وعلى ان أصبح رجلاً أفضل.لقد ساعدوني في ضبط فهمي لما يصنع بطلا ، وما يلزم لإلهام وتغيير هذا العالم للأفضل.</p>
<p>   And as I am leaving so soon, I wanted to do something special for them before I depart.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">وبما أنني سأغادر قريبًا ، أردت أن أفعل شيئًا مميزًا لهم قبل مغادرتي.</p>

<p>   What I am here to tell you is that I am writing an English and Arabic bilingual book of poetry for beginners. It is for anybody, for kids and adults that are not well-versed in the magic and might of poetry, and for those well-acquainted with its mystery and magic. In many ways, the book is for my students to read after I am gone, but in truth, it really ought to be shared with the world. </p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">ما أنا هنا لأخبركم به هو أنني أكتب حاليًا كتابًا للشعر باللغة الإنجليزية والعربية للمبتدئين.انه مناسب للجميع ، للأطفال والكبار ، لأولئك الذين ليسوا على دراية جيدة بسحر وقوة الشعر ، ولأولئك الذين على دراية بغموضه وسحره.بشكل عام ، هذا الكتاب مخصص لطلابي لقراءته بعد رحيلي ، لكن لكي أكون صادقا ، يجب مشاركته مع العالم أجمع.</p>
<p>   The book will teach its readers how to truly read poetry, how to write poetry with inspiration and passion, and ultimately, how to live a poetic life.

<p>I am a parent of three wonderful children, and have been working with children for 20 years, often supporting social and emotional development in  book smart kids who sometimes need some social guidance.  In that time, I have been a therapist, a social skill mentor, a teacher, and more recently, a parent. </p>
<p><i>In every setting that I have worked in, I have known children who are struggling with finding a container for their depth of knowledge that doesn't alienate them from others. This book addresses that question for children and those that support them.</i></p>
<p>As the information age has taken the world by storm, it has become more and more apparent to parents of gifted children and those who support them, that Academic gifts can only take you so far. Those that really thrive, learn the social skills necessary to use their intelligence thoughtfully... and kindly.</p>
<h3>What we need and what You Get</h3>

<li>
<strong>What You Get: (Aside from a kinder child): </strong>  Perks range from paperback book to a hardcover book, all the way to a personalized, in person,  workshop for parents, teachers, or counselors. </li>
<li>
<strong>What We Need:</strong> At this point, every sale takes us closer to our goal of being able to donate 100 books to schools and teachers that need it.   </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Do yourself a favor,  find a parent of a really bright child. Ask parents of a bright child if their child's intelligence has ever played a role in an awkward moment. If so, this book makes a great gift. If you are a school counselor, therapist or AIG teacher, this book can help you.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I believe this book has broad appeal to many parents and children, I know how to appeal to parents of the bright kids who struggle socially. I am an engaged participant in the Autism,  Gifted, and ADHD communities, and have been talking about this book with hundreds of parents for the last two years.</p>
<p>Additionally, my professional work brings me into contact with therapists, teachers, and parents who all have expressed interest in this book.</p>
<p>Finally, the low startup cost of a Print on Demand Publisher like Ingram means I can always start with more conservative goals. </p>

I believe this book has broad appeal to many parents and children, I know how to appeal to parents of the bright kids who struggle socially. I am an engaged participant in the Autism,  Gifted, and ADHD communities, and have been talking about this book with hundreds of parents for the last two years.
Additionally, my professional work brings me into contact with therapists, teachers, and parents who all have expressed interest in this book.
Finally, the low startup cost of a Print on Demand Publisher like Ingram means I can always start with more conservative goals.

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""http://amazon.com/author/jdcampolargo"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Generation Optimism</i></a></p>
<p><br/>My name is Juan David Campolargo, and I am the Author of Generation Optimism. I wrote this book because I realized that my generation (Gen Z)  and most of the population are shifting to be more pessimistic. In fact, my generation is one of the most pessimistic in the history of humankind.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will learn more about Optimism, the science of why we tend to be negative, and much, much more. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for optimism and perspective in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you take advantage of the benefits of living an OPTIMISTIC life.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about Optimism and Gaining perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>My personal journey of Optimism and how it has helped me</li>
<li>Deep understanding of our own human psychology &amp; why we are wired to be negative</li>
<li>Inspiring stories of other people’s journey of optimism. You will learn from people like Mark Cuban and other super interesting personalities.</li>
<li>You will love this book if you are looking to alter your perspective and an “Outlook of Optimism” is not your strong suit.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Generation Optimism is a non-fiction book that speaks to younger generations and individuals who perceive life in a pessimistic way. After reading this book, I am sure you will dare to be an Optimist.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - Generation Optimism</h2>
<p><br/>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction and Chapters 1-5. In the introduction, I start by giving you a different standpoint that I use to see life and the world. After that, the first chapters will include identifying how you think, whether you’re an optimist or a pessimist, the current state of the world, reasons for pessimism, the psychology of Optimism, and a little GIFT.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 6-10. These chapters will be focused on Learning To Be An Optimist. Optimism is a skill, and like many other skills, such as coding, public speaking, drawing. They can be LEARNED. That’s why I developed a method to start being an Optimist NOW.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 11-12. This part of the book will look to the future. The world will have difficulties, adversities, and challenges that have never existed before. With all the negativity and pessimism, we will not be able to solve them unless we proactively create and encourage more people to be optimistic... we might never solve them.</p>

<p><strong>Tandaia </strong>es una joven editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el <i>crowdfunding</i>.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy te presentamos a <strong>Eleonor Gil</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nació en Madrid, en el año 1972. De niña, lo que más le gustaba era que su abuelo le prestase su máquina de escribir, de la que brotaron numerosas poesías. Más tarde comenzó a anotar reflexiones sobre cualquier cosa y, de este modo, quizás por la consciencia del paso del tiempo, fue adquiriendo el hábito de trasladar al papel sus pensamientos... así como un amor desmesurado por las palabras.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Sus grandes pasiones siempre han sido la literatura, la música, y los viajes. Ha visitado más de nueve países, toca la guitarra, el piano, y le apasiona leer y escribir. <i>Huellas </i>es su primera novela y esta es la primera vez que se plantea publicar un libro.</p>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 840€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cuarenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.</li>
<li>Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.</li>
</ul>
<p>Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como una ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de <i>Huellas </i>que saldría pocas semanas después a la venta.</p>
<h3>Además...</h3>
<p>Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y <strong>Eleonor Gil </strong>vea publicada su obra.<br/><br/>Gracias por vuestro tiempo.</p>

Sus grandes pasiones siempre han sido la literatura, la música, y los viajes. Ha visitado más de nueve países, toca la guitarra, el piano, y le apasiona leer y escribir. Huellas es su primera novela y esta es la primera vez que se plantea publicar un libro.
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 840€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cuarenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como una ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de Huellas que saldría pocas semanas después a la venta.
Además...
Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Eleonor Gil vea publicada su obra.Gracias por vuestro tiempo.",0.0,0,"228 Campaigns

<p>“Mrinalika,” is
a contemporary, literary romance about the love affair of two very
dissimilar persons. Mrinalika and Rafael meet in New York while
attending a UNESCO sponsored conference. Differences in culture, long
separations, and marriages to other people will test and strain their
relationship until it reaches its inevitable conclusion twenty years
later and again in New York.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rafael Artebuz has a Ph.
D. in Latin American Literature. Yet, he is a lowly municipal worker
wasting his life as director of a small museum in Guadalajara,
Mexico. He says he has taken the job while waiting for the city
government to build a cultural center of which he has been promised
the directorship.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much to his surprise, he
receives an invitation to a UNESCO sponsored meeting in New York
City. The invitation is especially surprising since the object of the
meeting is to petition the UN to declare 1986 as “The Year of
Autochthonous Cultures,” a subject of which he knows little and
cares even less about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, he does want to go to
the Big Apple: there's an ex-lover is there: a woman who works for
UNESCO and whom Rafael suspects is the one who managed to get him
invited to the meeting so he could have an excuse to go the New York.
He had a love affair with her two years before and he certainly would
not mind a repeat performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, he is too low on the
municipality's hierarchy to rate travel expenses. Knowing that his
boss has always wanted to go to the United States, a country that has
banned his entry due to his leftist-socialist activism, Rafael
appeals to Roy Miller, a friend in the American Consulate. He would
like Miller to use his influence to get Rafael's boss a visa in
exchange for approving Rafael's travel requisition. Roy Miller does
so in exchange for a future favor. “You will owe me big time,” he
says to Rafael.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rafael plans to spend his
week in New York avoiding his boss and “boozing around town with
the Belgian” as he puts it. But, his plans are interrupted by
Mrinalika Sundaripara, an engaged artist from New Delhi. She, unlike
Rafael, is interested in autochthonous cultures, especially their
arts and crafts. The UNESCO meeting is not the only reason she has
come to New York: she is also there to negotiate a deal with the
publisher who wants to publish her book on saving autochthonous art,
and she is going to have a solo exhibition of her art in a SoHo
gallery. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As unlikely as it would
seem, these two persons of dissimilar character, background, and
outlook in life, fall in love. Initially, it is Mrinalika who does
the pursuing, much to the befuddlement of Rafael. He will discover
that she has a special reason for doing so. He resists her advances
but soon surrenders to her charm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>“Mrinalika
and Rafael,” is the story of their love affair and how the
differences in the their cultures, their customs, the social and
political background of their countries influence their relationship,
causing it to ebb and flow, to  flare up with passion, and sometimes,
to succumb to anger and distrust.</p>

<h3>Why do I need funding?</h3> <p></p>
<p>“Mrinalika, a Third World romance” (working title), is 103,000 words long. The reason I am asking for funding is that I would like to have it edited and critiqued by a professional editor with more than twenty years of experience in the publishing industry. In today's publishing environment, in which thousands of books come to market through self-publishing, Kindle, and ebook production houses, it is difficult to get agents and publishing houses to consider books by unknown authors. By having my book edited not only for the usual grammar and style issues but also critiqued for the value of its content, I will increase the possibility of agents and/or a publishing houses showing interest in it. Also, this particular professional editor offers to help in reaching agents and publishers that to her knowledge are the best to approach according to the type of novel I have written.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact Your Contribution Will Have</h3> <p>Independent book editors  are persons qualified to better a manuscript by editing it for grammar, punctuation, and format issues; they can also give an author advice on content, structure, and style. The manuscripts of even the best writers can benefit from an objective and qualified review by an experienced editor. Small things like typos, bad grammar, and awkward sentence construction can keep an agent or publisher from seriously considering a manuscript or even from reading it. Here are a few reasons more why it makes sense to use a professional, independent editor:</p> <ul>
<li>Agents or editors that work in a publishing house are not bound by contract or pay to do the best job possible on a manuscript; they also have several manuscripts to work on at the same time, thus giving only partial attention to yours. </li> <li>Working with a professional editor will insure that my manuscript receives full and focused attention; communication with such an editor will give me insights into the construction and development of plot and characters that would be impossible reach on my own. </li> <li>Editors work in a network of agents, publishers, and other editors which might result in interesting referrals. </li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks and challanges</h3> <p>It is important to note that using a professional editor to edit and critique a manuscript does not guarantee that the manuscript will be accepted by an agent or a publisher. Today's publishing environment is more difficult than ever and both agents and publishers are more concerned with the business aspect of publishing than in literary merit. Even if an agent accepts to represent a writer, or a publisher signs a contract, it may be months or years before the manuscript turns into a published book. Having said that, I do believe that attempting to get an agent interested in my manuscript without having it polished and edited professionally, would make it even harder to see it published as a book and/or distributed widely as an ebook. To minimize the risk, I plan to:</p> <ul>
<li>Pick an editor with a track record of success and who is knowledgeable in the genre of fiction I have written.</li> <li>Once the manuscript is in the best form possible, send queries and samples only to agents best suited to the manuscript's content.</li> </ul>

<p>Laura is one of the top psychics in the City of Angels and has clients all over the world.  She is a psychic medium, angel communicator, actress, singer, and host. She is also an avid writer and adventurer who travels as much as her imagination allows.  She received her bachelor’s degree in theatre and her master’s degree in political science from the University of Colorado. In addition to seeing clients, Laura teaches classes on the psychic realm and writes about her experiences.  This is her 6<sup>th</sup> book on the psychic and spiritual realm and she is already working on her 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup>.  When she is not writing or traveling, you may find her exploring the unknown.  You can find more information on her work in the spiritual and metaphysical realms at <a href=""http://www.healingpowers.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.healingpowers.net</a> and more on her acting, singing, hosting, and creative work at <a href=""http://www.laurapowers.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.laurapowers.net</a></p>
<p><strong>What the Book is About</strong></p>

This book is designed to entertain and to keep you safe from vampires, werewolves, djinn, and other supernatural creatures that share our world. Have you wondered if these are purely fictional creatures? This book will help you separate the fact from the fiction and be better equipped to handle whatever supernatural entities come your way.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a="""">I was born and raised in the heart of
the Bible belt, and my faith has always been an extremely important
aspect of my life. Since I was only seven years old, I knew that I
was supposed to be in the ministry, spreading the message of Jesus
Christ. The problem was that since around that same time, I also knew
that I was gay, and these two did not work very well together. 

<p>
</p><p>So, I suppressed my feelings and put on
a mask that I called “Straight-Face.” Straight-face had one duty:
to convince everyone else – including God – that I wasn't gay.
Straight-face and I fought back and forth for control, and journeyed
together to figure out life, faith, doubt, sexuality, and everything
in between. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This book is a memoir of that journey;
it is my story. But, the story does not belong only to me – this is
the same story that many are living out every day, which is why this
story needs to be heard. There are thousands that are still being
suffocated by their own masks, and they need to experience the true
freedom that Christ offers. Even more, there are others that want to
know what it is like to live in the closet in a conservative
environment. This memoir details the intense psychological side of
constantly trying to hide your true identity, all the while silently
suffering in the solitude of shame. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My journey has not been easy, but the
result has been beautiful, and there are many others that need to
know that their journey is going to end beautifully, as well. This
memoir is about Jesus, Straight-Face, and I all trying to figure out
how to get along – and realizing that sometimes, three really can
be a crowd.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Why an Indiegogo campaign?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>The
book is set to release on May 31<sup>st</sup>,
but just publishing a book is not enough. For the story to really get
out there, I am in need of a publicist, as well as other marketing
materials.
This is going to cost me a pretty penny, and as a school teacher, it
is a pretty penny that I do not have! I am going to need about $5000
to get this thing going, but I believe enough people out there know
that the future is bright, and will
want to help get us there with their minor gifts towards the cause.
Your gift, no matter the size, will help get this story into the

hopefully lead them to freedom.</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>The legend of Camelot, we’ve all heard of the story. King Arthur is the most loved King of all time and meets the love of his life, Guinevere. They fall madly in love and for time, their marriage and the Kingdom rein victorious over all else. Enter Lancelot, the most valiant and noble of all Knights the world has known. Forbidden love ensues and the world that Arthur has worked his entire life for is thrown into turmoil and anarchy. It is probably the most famous love triangle of all time. </em><br/><br/><em>Now what would happen if we threw a twist in the story… say Guinevere and Lancelot are not from the 5th century, but from modern day America? Reflections Of The Legend delves deep into the story, adding a modern day twist to the romance. </em><br/><br/><em>Genny and Lance are young and in love. Can they overcome the obstacles of romance, true love, primal urges, betrayal, death and a time portal? Follow their story that weaves them in and out of the story that has been written since the dawn of time; or has it. Did the legend really happen the way history has told us, or have we all been deceived? </em><br/><br/><em>The Passion Of A New Day introduces us to the story from the beginning, where the deceit starts. Learn how all of our favorite characters and stories actually happened and how a little girl’s smile and heart begin to unravel the truth of history, revealing it is only a Reflection Of The Legend itself.</em></p>
<h2>Who and Why</h2>
<p>Who am I? That is the hardest question anyone can ask, at least of me. I mean, how do you tell a story that is still being written? Who I am is so much more than can explained in a short little paragraph. Titles can be given, Teacher, Doctor, Lawyer, Actor, Producer… We all have titles that make up who we are and what we do. I think the one thing that I am above anything else, deep down inside, is a dreamer.</p>
<p>For the last 18 years I have been defined as mom, mommy, and the always lovely to hear from a teenager, (Insert eye roll and attitude here), Mother. I have two of the most wonderful and lovely girls on the face of the planet. I have lived for them and no one else since they were a glimmer in my eye. Everything I have done has been for them. Now, I love being a mom, please don’t think I don’t love it, cause I do. It’s the best dream I could have ever fulfilled, but it’s the only dream I have fulfilled. I’m a dreamer. I want more.</p>
<p>We have all had dreams. When we’re young, we have the entire world at our fingertips and our limitations seem inconsequential. We have the time to do everything and anything we want to. Then we get older and sometimes our dreams become harder to see at times or are replaced by other dreams we may not have known we had or knew we wanted. We grow older still and our lives evolve into new ideas and our limitations tend to grow. Dreams are replaced by reality and our selflessness pushes our dreams to the background, we give ourselves to others and focus less on the dreams that used to be so clear. Before you know it, life has moved on and those dreams are a distant memory, knocking at that door in the back of your brain, asking if it can come out to play.</p>
<p>From as far back as I can remember, I had instilled in me that I can be and do anything that I wanted to, so long as I work hard for it. That is what I have tried to give to my girls as well, I just hope that they find their dream and are able to fulfill it long before I have. So now I suppose I must show them by example. I have to live up to what I am trying to teach them and finish what I have started.</p>
<p>I began writing Reflections Of The Legend almost 3 years ago. I wrote little bits and pieces here and there whenever I had time. I have always loved the legend of King Arthur and Camelot for as long as I could remember and writing a story that weaved itself in and out of that story was fun and even relaxing at times after a hard day. It was a release, a way to vent. You see I’m a dreamer so it was fun to dream and forget the ugliness that life can throw at you sometimes. About a year a half ago, life threw a curve ball at me. Without going into detail, I will tell you that it has been life altering. The fear of loosing a loved one is… scary for lack of a better term. Reality tore apart my view of life. It was no longer unending and limitless, there are limits, time limits.</p>
<p>It finally hit me that I didn’t have all the time in the world to tinker with my dreams. I needed to finally fulfill this lifetime goal I have had since the first time I typed on an antiquated computer when I was 6 and wrote a two-paragraph story about a puppy. So I finally buckled down and faced my dream, nightmares at times, and finished writing my first manuscript. I thought that writing the 700+ pages (almost 800) was the achievement of a lifetime, and it was. I have never been more proud of myself. I haven’t felt that in a long time. But as much as I am proud of myself, I need to take the next step and complete that dream of becoming a published author. I think this is the scariest thing I have done in my life.</p>
<p>I love books. They are a treasure worth more than any monetary value. Stories, poems, music, even movies, they all help us through our day and make life worth the effort. Who hasn’t curled up on a rainy day with a good book and felt the highs and lows of their beloved characters. I want to give that to the world, but I need your help.</p>
<p>They say honesty is the best policy so here goes. Basically I need money to finish the final editing and processing of my manuscripts for distribution. It’s plain and simple right? That’s what I thought but I was sadly mistaken. It’s been a lot harder than I ever would have thought.</p>
<p>We’ve all had hopes and dreams to do things beyond our own limited means and aspirations. I need help. I’d like to pose a question to you all. How many of you can honestly say that you are able to live out your dream on a daily basis? Okay, now for that handful of you that mentally raised your hands, how many of you did that on your own, with absolutely no help from anyone else? I have a feeling most of those hands went down. I am asking you to help this dreamer fulfill her ultimate dream. I can’t do it without you.</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>The funding goal is set at $5000. Yes, I was shocked too when I researched how much it would cost to hire a professional editor. I love my books and I want you all too as well. A professional editor is just as important to the success of my story as, well, the story itself. All contributions will go towards the cost of a professional editor, processing fees and marketing of the series Reflections Of The Legend by CreateSpace, an affiliate of Amazon.com. It will also cover shipping costs of the perks offered with your donations.</p>
<p>Okay, they tell me I should tell you where the funds will go if I don’t reach my goal. That’s so negative, I hate to think that I won't reach my goal. However, all funds, whether my goal is reached or not will go towards the publishing of this book and NOWHERE else. I am determinded to have this series published.</p>
<p>Please take a look at all the perks to the right.</p>
<p>I’m sure there is something there that tickles your fancy. Ever want to be immortalized in a book. There are perks for that, from being listed in the Acknowledgements or even dedicate my book to you and a lucky few. There are autographed posters and autographed copies of the first installment of the series, The Passion Of A New Day. There are perks where you can vote on what the actual book cover will be. Or if you are inclined you have the opportunity of becoming part of the story by having a character named after you in the fourth and final book of the series and even help decide how the series will end.</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact You Will Have</strong></h2>
<p>I think I pretty much covered this in the first section. Your contributions will help  my, long awaited, dreams come true. You'll create my happily ever after. The world will never tire of new stories to be told. Please help add this one to the ever-expanding universe.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute and that is TOTALLY okay and understandable, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help.</p>

<p>I'm an intuitive writer. By intuitive I mean that I'm not planning my stories. They come to me in the form of images. It's like having a film being played up from my inner eye. I follow the unfoldning with great excitement. Not even I, the author, knows how the story will end. It feels as if they are given to me. As if someone wanted me to tell these stories. The Bear Woman and two other stories came to me very suddenly and quickly some years ago. It's making them into physical books that is taking time. Firstly I write in Swedish which is my mother tongue. I tried publishers in Sweden with little success. I then decided to self publish as I could see all the advantages. It would give me the freedom to choose an illustrator and I wouldn't be forced to make any changes against my will. I decided to translate one of the stories to reach more readers and it also made sense as I live in the UK. I believed in the stories from the moment I had written them down and I knew I had to find the right illustrator. Now 4 years later I'm glad I had the patience. I have found a publisher that believes in both The Bear Woman and the illustrator. I think and hope The Bear Woman is a story that will appeal to many ages. It's something universal and mythical about it and I know the illustrator Dorrie Joy will bring my story to life with her magical paintings (<a href=""http://www.dorriejoy.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.dorriejoy.co.uk</a>).</p>
<p>The Bear Woman is a story about love. A powerful, dramatic and adventurous narrative of Rion and Loana's possible and impossible love. It is a story that inspires us to never lose hope and to never let go of our dreams, regardless of how inconceivable they may seem. Bear Woman can be read by children from seven years of age and upwards, but is also a tale for grown-ups who have long since lost touch of their enigmatic, dreamy and magical childhood world.</p>
<p>Dorrie Joy will begin painting for The Bear Woman in May. The only thing that remains is funding for the printing and publication costs. So the only risk as I see it is that you wont be able to enjoy this mesmerizing story with illustrations :)</p>

<h3>The OmniWitch Magazine</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Riley Bee and I am creating The OmniWitch, a magazine made by witches, for witches.</p>
<p>I have been practicing Witchcraft for about 6 years now, and thought it would be great if we could get all kinds of witches together, helping to guide each other down their paths. I also wanted the witches to be a diverse team, offering opinions from all kinds of paths.</p>
<p>It started out as just an errant thought which so many witches seemed to like. The support of everyone I mentioned it to moved me and I realised that this was something that should happen. And here we are! I've researched the kind of content everyone wanted to see and have put together a team of diverse witches to help create this. Now we just need the money and support to bring this creation to paper.</p>
<p>We have an amazing team of diverse and talented witches and spiritualists who will be creating amazing content every month for you all.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need this money to actually print the first issue of The OmniWitch. The absolute minimum we need is $300, this will cover all of our printing costs for the first issue. Hopefully we can collect more than that to ensure that we can continue past the first issue.</p>

Hello! My name is Riley Bee and I am creating The OmniWitch, a magazine made by witches, for witches.
I have been practicing Witchcraft for about 6 years now, and thought it would be great if we could get all kinds of witches together, helping to guide each other down their paths. I also wanted the witches to be a diverse team, offering opinions from all kinds of paths.
It started out as just an errant thought which so many witches seemed to like. The support of everyone I mentioned it to moved me and I realised that this was something that should happen. And here we are! I've researched the kind of content everyone wanted to see and have put together a team of diverse witches to help create this. Now we just need the money and support to bring this creation to paper.
We have an amazing team of diverse and talented witches and spiritualists who will be creating amazing content every month for you all.

What We Need & What You Get
We need this money to actually print the first issue of The OmniWitch. The absolute minimum we need is $300, this will cover all of our printing costs for the first issue. Hopefully we can collect more than that to ensure that we can continue past the first issue.
Everyone in the magazine (including myself) is working on an entirely voluntary basis.

</div><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>Hitchhiking GT is about translating and publishing the story of a spirited, funny, downright frank, naive, a bit crazy, innocent but decent and also rather courageous Transylvanian student (he likes being called ""Timo"") who was as poor as a church mouse, but wanted to travel the world.</p><p>For this young man, travel was not a matter of money, but a matter of courage, so he took the 70 Euros he had in his pocket and headed from Transylvania towards Mongolia and Vladivostok (the far, far extremity of Siberia). This is how the story started. Three years later, he had travelled in 78 different countries, counting 222.140 km done exclusively by hitchhiking. He's gathered 1.325 pages of an adventurous travel journal that includes amazing stories from stunning places or about extraordinary human beings.</p><p>One day, he thought: ""How about putting all those pages of incredible adventures and encounters in a book?"". The task is not as easy as it may seem, though. Thus, this crowd-funding campaign is meant to fundraise the minimum amount of money that is necessary to translate his first volume of the book (440 pages) in English and Spanish. But is it worthy, you may ask, to translate those stories and share them with the entire world? Let's have a pick at some of them and then you can decide for yourself:</p><p>When I was in Switzerland, I helped the police capture an extremely dangerous (wasted &amp; drunk) driver:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442504172/xqmikrd5sxpjeg1lbptu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>In Siberia, my boots got ripped, so all I got left was the sandals below.

<p>Here are some reviews Romanian readers did about Timo's writings on his blog: <a href=""http://www.autostopmagellan.ro/recenzii-carte-inconjurul-lumii-cu-autostopul-timotei-rad/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.autostopmagellan.ro/recenzii-carte-inconjurul-lumii-cu-autostopul-timotei-rad/</a> </p>
<h3>What Timo Needs</h3>
<p>After he reserched for 6 months all relevant travel literature of the last 140 years, what he needs now is a professional Romanian translator will charge about 3.000 – 3.500 USD for the 440 pages of the first volume. This is the minimim amount needed for this project. If the campaign will exceed the 7.000 USD initial budget, the money will be used to hire a professional editor and a publishing agent. If, after all this, there will be any money left, Timo will get back on the road. He's one bucket list wish is that he dies hitchhiking :)</p>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Great perks :)</p>
<p>Timo is selling travel atlases and book collections he acquired hardly during his academical years, from his 200 euros/month salary. He is also selling his most valuable books (a 1887 English Bible and a 1846 French New Testament) and stones he had collected during his rides.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In his home country, Romania, Timo's story was presented by important national TV stations (TVR 1, TVR 2, Antena 1, PRO TV, Realitatea), important national newspapers (Adevarul, Jurnalul National, Gazeta Sporturilor, Click) and also by online publications. The mainstream media usually presented his story as the unusual way of life of a weird loafer. Truth is he never had a marketing specialist or a public relations team to support him, so he did everything by himself. </p>

<p>Martin, a guy who took him hitchhiking on the road, presented him to a journalist who wrote the article; afterwards, Martin offered him a lift on his old viking boat, too).</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are no guarantees that the book will become an international best seller... :) Ok, that's not the main risk. Even if we do not get the entire amount of money neccessary for translating and publishing the book, we will try to translate and publish it with less money – maybe we'll find some kind-hearted translators and editors who will help Timo even if the payment will not be so great for them.</p>
<p>The greatest challenge is, nevertheless, to turn this amazing solo adventure of his into something worth reading by thousands, as the adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, for instance, that have inspired generations. The message Timo wishes to send to the world is that life is beautiful (la vita e bella!) and travelling, even with little money, can teach everyone some valuable lessons about humanity.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Here are some reviews Romanian readers did about Timo's writings on his blog: http://www.autostopmagellan.ro/recenzii-carte-inconjurul-lumii-cu-autostopul-timotei-rad/ 
What Timo Needs
After he reserched for 6 months all relevant travel literature of the last 140 years, what he needs now is a professional Romanian translator will charge about 3.000 – 3.500 USD for the 440 pages of the first volume. This is the minimim amount needed for this project. If the campaign will exceed the 7.000 USD initial budget, the money will be used to hire a professional editor and a publishing agent. If, after all this, there will be any money left, Timo will get back on the road. He's one bucket list wish is that he dies hitchhiking :)

What You Get
Great perks :)
Timo is selling travel atlases and book collections he acquired hardly during his academical years, from his 200 euros/month salary. He is also selling his most valuable books (a 1887 English Bible and a 1846 French New Testament) and stones he had collected during his rides.
A) Foreign Policy Romania - 14 Volumes (July 2008 - October 2011) - 30 USD:


B) Semi-precious stones from my roads - 30 USD:

C) Prehistoric Saharian Spearhead - 50 USD - (An anthropologist took me hitchhiking in Sahara and he offered me some of the artefacts he found in the sands of the desert):

D) Prehistoric Saharian Arrowhead - 100 USD - (An anthropologist took me hitchhiking in Sahara and he offered me some of the artefacts he found in the sands of the desert):


E) Prehistoric Human Otolith - 100 USD - (An anthropologist took me hitchhiking in Sahara and he offered me some of the artefacts he found in the sands of the desert):
F) Atlas - 7 Volumes - 50 USD:


H) Civilizații/Civilizations - 7 Volumes - 50 USD:




I) Jules Verne - 30 Volumes - 100 USD:

J) National Geographic Romania (mai 2003 - october 2012) - 500 USD:



L) Atlas DeAgostini - 9 volume, 4 000 pagini - 500 USD:




Re-copertate foarte profesional.

M) 100 personalități care au influențat istoria omenirii/100 personalities which changed history - 200 USD:


N) An very, very old English Bible (1887) - 500 USD:

O) An very, very old New Testament (1846) - 500 USD:



P) Great Painters (14 Volumes) and Museums (7 Volumes) - 100 USD





The Impact
In his home country, Romania, Timo's story was presented by important national TV stations (TVR 1, TVR 2, Antena 1, PRO TV, Realitatea), important national newspapers (Adevarul, Jurnalul National, Gazeta Sporturilor, Click) and also by online publications. The mainstream media usually presented his story as the unusual way of life of a weird loafer. Truth is he never had a marketing specialist or a public relations team to support him, so he did everything by himself. 


He also had two interviews abroad:
1) In Spain (as he is one of the craziest FC Barcelona fans you will ever meet!):
http://www.sport.es/es/noticias/barca/recorre-mundo-autostop-con-una-bufanda-del-barca-3638966


2) Norway:
http://www.nrk.no/troms/har-haiket-156.000-kilometer-1.11777882


Martin, a guy who took him hitchhiking on the road, presented him to a journalist who wrote the article; afterwards, Martin offered him a lift on his old viking boat, too).


Risks & Challenges
There are no guarantees that the book will become an international best seller... :) Ok, that's not the main risk. Even if we do not get the entire amount of money neccessary for translating and publishing the book, we will try to translate and publish it with less money – maybe we'll find some kind-hearted translators and editors who will help Timo even if the payment will not be so great for them.
The greatest challenge is, nevertheless, to turn this amazing solo adventure of his into something worth reading by thousands, as the adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, for instance, that have inspired generations. The message Timo wishes to send to the world is that life is beautiful (la vita e bella!) and travelling, even with little money, can teach everyone some valuable lessons about humanity.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Hi, I’m Gail Mae Ferguson-Maceda, I’m an EFT Practitioner in New York City. My other careers were as a ballerina, a performer on Broadway, a choreographer and teacher. My favorite job is as a Mom of five great kids! I am really passionate about EFT which stands for Emotional Freedom Techniques. EFT is an amazing new energy therapy that helps people be free of emotional trauma that keeps them either stuck in life or causes a lot of anxiety. Many of our problems go back to some kind of trauma (big or small) that keeps us from achieving many of our goals in life such as great relationships and financial success.  These traumas can also cause fears, phobias, pain and disease.<br/><br/>I wrote this book about John because I thought that if we could clear a lot of the bad stuff that happens in school or home right away when it happens, how much easier growing up would be. John’s story is the first in a series of books I am writing to help kids. Although John’s story is not a huge trauma, many little ones, like his experience in the book, can add up to an adult John being terrified to speak at a conference his boss has asked him to present at or prevent him from applying for a job he really wants.  Fear can stop us from doing a lot of the great things we would love to do in life. Think of how many Ghandis, Beethovens, Rosa Parks or Mother Teresas there are in the world who are maybe too afraid to speak up and be heard because they had so much unhealed trauma in their childhoods.  We all know there are some kids who have serious trauma, just imagine a world where their traumas are taken care of in an easy and gentle way.<br/><br/>I want to take my book and EFT to schools to share with kids, parents, teachers and counselors. EFT helps kids with test and performance anxiety, ADHD, allergies and all kinds of other problems. It helps the teacher calm the kids down so their minds are ready and open to learning. It helps them to have more caring and understanding relationships with their schoolmates.<br/><br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
I would like to raise $3,000 to pay my wonderful and amazing illustrator who made the video and who helped me with formatting my book, not to mention my grammar. Thank you Manoj!!. This amount will also cover copyright and publishing costs, for books to be given to schools and libraries, as well as to put up a website that kids, parents and teachers can go to to get more information about EFT, tapping scripts and other stories about tapping. <br/><br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
EFT has made such a huge difference in the quality of my life. My mission is to spread the word to as many people as possible and help as many parents and kids as possible. Parenting is an awesome and difficult job. My mission and my passion is to help others to realize that they are:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>a) not alone,</div>
<div>b) not going crazy,</div>
<div>c) normal,</div>
<div>d) not at fault, and,</div>
<div>e) worthy and deserving of love.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Thank you for contributing to my campaign. i love you and am grateful from the bottom of my heart. I want you to know that there may be a child, a parent or a teacher out there whose life could be changed for the better from reading my book and learning about EFT.  By contributing, you have done a really awesome and wonderful thing.

Ever the adventurer, young Edgar J. Hawthorne sets out on a journey to the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa to investigate the Great Moon Hoax of 1835 after reading an article in the Edinburgh Journal of Science submitted by none other than close family friend John Herschel.
Travelling with the Royal Air Brigade on the Stratos, Her Majesty's newest and most advanced airship, Edgar and the crew are caught unaware in the early dawn by a group of marauders who force the Stratos down into the deep jungles of Africa with the aid of an on-board saboteur.
In search of provisions, once on the ground, Edgar and a portion of the crew stumble across an ancient ziggurat with a hidden entrance. Once inside Edgar discovers an ancient tale of prophecy written in hieroglyphs warning of an impending attack.
After many more trials and hardships Edgar and the crew, finally able to continue on their journey, arrive at the Cape of Good Hope behind schedule only to find disaster has befallen Herschel and the Royal Observatory.
Something is amiss and Edgar suspects there are other forces involved in the incident at the Observatory and with the help of Herschel's assistant Thomas Coleman, Edgar sets out to solve the mystery only to uncover a secret that could mean the end of all mankind.

<div>In September of 2014, a coalition was formed by movie-lovers at Ithaca College. Numbering a dozen members in its early days, we sought to establish an organization that would give all student cinephiles a place to share their thoughts and learn from each other about film - outside the sometimes restricting boundaries of the classroom.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Filmic primarily splits itself between two activities. The first is the magazine, which represents a wide diversity of topics in cinema. Old and new, blockbusters and indie darlings, ""highbrow"" and ""lowbrow."" We've covered everything from 80's horror schlock, the films of Kevin Smith and favorite moments from the <i>Star Wars </i>saga to obscure foreign cinema (e.g. <i>Amer</i>, <i>Lilja 4-Ever</i> &amp; <i>Wake in Fright</i>), Lars von Trier and the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. Everything (both the issues and the individual, standalone articles) is posted to our <a href=""http://filmicmag.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> and the pieces cover about 13 sections including:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Reviews (Contemporary and Throwback)</li>
<li>Hidden Gems (Write-ups on lesser-known works)</li>
<li>Analyze This! (Thorough technical or thematic breakdowns of various movies)</li>
<li>Versus (Head-to-head match-ups of similar films)</li>
<li>Discourse (One on one debates/discussions on the merits of a film or filmmaker)</li>
<li>For the Love of Film (Personal narratives from our contributors on how they came to love the medium)</li>
</ul>
<div>While our articles reach fellow IC students and movie fans beyond, our second activity is targeted at the immediate campus community. Each semester, we strive to put on a screening series representing the same diversity of topics that the magazine covers. Each film is followed by an informal discussion with the audience. Spring of 2015 marked our first one and we showed the following films:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>
<i>The Night of the Hunter</i> (Charles Laughton, 1955)</li>
<li>
<i>La Haine</i> (Mathieu Kassovitz, 1995)</li>
<li>
<i>The Fly </i>(David Cronenberg, 1986)</li>
<li>
<i>Koyaanisqatsi</i> (Godfrey Reggio, 1982)</li>
<li>
<i>Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters </i>(Paul Schrader, 1985)</li>
</ul></div>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Where is the money going?</h3> <p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>50%</b> goes to the printing costs of the three issues we're aiming for in the Spring. In addition to going up online, we run physical copies, which are distributed around campus and the local art house cinemas.</li>
<li>
<b>30% </b>goes to securing the rights for the three films we plan on showing for the Spring screening series. Unlike professors showing movies for a course, we are not exempt from having to purchase public performance rights.</li>

</ul>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why this matters</h3> <p>While based at a school that is celebrated for its film program, we encourage students from every academic department to join us because we believe in cinema's universal appeal and its ability to enrich and inspire, regardless of whether or not you mean to make a career out of it.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, and welcome to the world of †3Dark. If you're new to us, then we humbly bid you take a pew in our dark cathedral. If you're already an acolyte of our order, then we may merely exchange the secret handshake. </p>
<p>†3Dark is a project that aims to publish radical fiction by both new and established voices. We value art over commercial appeal, deep understanding over zeitgeists. The stories here do not conform to standard publishing lengths and play with structure in compelling ways. Our work explores the bigger questions of reality: the spiritual, other worlds, who we are, what is our purpose, is there such a thing as good and evil, and if there is: is the dark side stronger? Our first issue was praised for the quality of its production and stories. We're very proud of that. Our second issue hopes to be even better, with incredible tales from <strong>Andy Cashmore, Anthony Self, </strong> <strong>Christa Wojciechowski</strong> and <strong>Richard Thomas! </strong> </p>
<p>Don't believe us? Well, check out this review of our first issue from the great Eden Royce, guru of Southern Gothic fiction and author of <i>Spook Lights</i> 1 &amp; 2 :</p>
<p>“While this project had to change from its original concept of 13 individual stories, released separately, the final product is no less stunning. And it holds fast to its original promise of story theme: Light and dark. Sacred and profane. Comprised of short dark stories by three authors, each with an intro by editor Joseph Sale, †3 Dark also gives each tale searingly gorgeous artwork packaged with an eerie cover”  – Eden Royce</p>
<p>These stories will total some 41,000 words of fiction! </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To explain our figure of £1,400... We will need a minimum of £315 to pay for print costs. In order to complete this issue, we will also need £800.00 to pay our artist Shawn Langley for concept artwork for each story.

<h3>Our story </h3>
<p><strong>Marhaba!</strong> We are Tim Bruns, Markus Maier, and Ben Korff.</p>
<ul>
<li>We've spent much of the <strong>past 5 years in Palestine</strong> climbing, teaching and developing new climbing sites around the West Bank.</li>
<li>When we arrived in 2014, there were few Palestinian climbers and the only climbing sites in the West Bank were in Israeli-controlled areas.</li>
<li>We <strong>started by bolting climbing routes</strong> near the Palestinian village of Ein Qiniya and the development spread.... </li>
<li>In 2016, Tim (author) and Will Harris opened <strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/wadiclimbing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wadi Climbing</a>,</strong> the first indoor climbing gym in Palestine. The local climbing community has grown from there. </li>
<li>To date, we have bolted over <strong>170 new sport climbing routes </strong>around the West Bank (with lots of help!) </li>
<li>Today, Palestine is home to a <strong>vibrant climbing community</strong> and unique climbing sites in a bucolic, Levantine setting.</li>
<li>Its time to share this with the world! </li>
</ul>
<p>With this book we hope to encourage people to <strong>visit and climb in Palestine. </strong>We want to show that Palestine can be a <strong>fun, safe and captivating place to visit</strong>. We are also advocating for increased freedom of movement for Palestinians who live under Israeli military occupation.

There are also world-class climbing routes, delicious Palestinian meals, welcoming local climbers and beers after climbing at one of Ramallah's many bars. Climbing, and the freedom of movement it provides, has a special significance in this troubled context. </p>

<h3>In Short</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Isabelle Kenyon and I'm a freelance editor and publisher in the North of the UK. I'm passionate about poetry and believe that socially conscious work has the power to change opinion. I publish high quality anthologies on pressing issues, chapbooks and poetry products, from exceptional poets around the globe.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Will Get!</h3>
<p>The funds will be used for making Fly on the Wall Poetry a sustainable press - it will ensure that submissions are forever free, and that I can pay my contributors with both royalties and free books!  <a href=""http://www.flyonthewallpoetry.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.flyonthewallpoetry.co.uk  </a></p>
<p>The funds will be specifically used for the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Artist fees for 2 chapbooks</li>
<li>Website fees for this year.</li>
<li> Author copies and postage</li>
<li>Marketing my press effectively via print, online and facebook advertising</li>
<li> Keeping the webzine and submissions going forward forever free!</li>
</ol>
<p>You will be able to access the following, based on your lovely donations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arts Marketing consultancy including an hour Skype call and 3 month customised marketing plan. I specialise in books, but have great experience in press coverage and online marketing.</li>
<li>Manuscript editing and proofreading - for free! I edit both poetry and prose. </li>
<li>Individual poem/short story feedback.</li>
<li>Free anthologies - Please Hear What I'm Not Saying or Persona Non Grata, delivered to your door.</li>
<li>Free chapbooks - I can currently offer my own work, Digging Holes To Another Continent, or This is not a Spectacle</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>My anthologies are valuable worldwide for their power to change opinion and fundraise - I have raised over £548 for UK mental health charity, Mind so far with the press' first anthology, 'Please Hear What I'm Not Saying'. I believe words have the power to evoke change and your funding will allow me to make a difference.</li>
<li><p>Chapbooks will be launched next year, and with a large scale anthology being announced at the start of next year, your support will be greatly appreciated. It will mean I can continue to publish high quality books which respect the talent of the poets and artists who have contributed to them.</p></li>
<li><p>Any extra funds raised will be used to sustain the press for the future, and will mean I can commission poets and artists, ensuring they are paid for their high quality work! </p></li>
<li>I started the press as a simple blog last year, and now I'm looking at making this a part time job!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My press has focused on working with charities for these fantastic anthologies, which means that the profit margin for the press is next to none. The future will keep up this brilliant fundraising work, but focus on campaigning. </p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing chapbooks will ensure the press has a focus on individual talent, rather than solely revolving on charity work.</li>
<li>I am developing my editing and marketing services to ensure the press is sustainable!</li>

Artist fees for 2 chapbooks
Website fees for this year.
 Author copies and postage
Marketing my press effectively via print, online and facebook advertising
 Keeping the webzine and submissions going forward forever free!

You will be able to access the following, based on your lovely donations:

Arts Marketing consultancy including an hour Skype call and 3 month customised marketing plan. I specialise in books, but have great experience in press coverage and online marketing.
Manuscript editing and proofreading - for free! I edit both poetry and prose. 
Individual poem/short story feedback.
Free anthologies - Please Hear What I'm Not Saying or Persona Non Grata, delivered to your door.
Free chapbooks - I can currently offer my own work, Digging Holes To Another Continent, or This is not a Spectacle


The Impact

My anthologies are valuable worldwide for their power to change opinion and fundraise - I have raised over £548 for UK mental health charity, Mind so far with the press' first anthology, 'Please Hear What I'm Not Saying'. I believe words have the power to evoke change and your funding will allow me to make a difference.
Chapbooks will be launched next year, and with a large scale anthology being announced at the start of next year, your support will be greatly appreciated. It will mean I can continue to publish high quality books which respect the talent of the poets and artists who have contributed to them.
Any extra funds raised will be used to sustain the press for the future, and will mean I can commission poets and artists, ensuring they are paid for their high quality work! 
I started the press as a simple blog last year, and now I'm looking at making this a part time job!


Risks & Challenges
My press has focused on working with charities for these fantastic anthologies, which means that the profit margin for the press is next to none. The future will keep up this brilliant fundraising work, but focus on campaigning. 

Publishing chapbooks will ensure the press has a focus on individual talent, rather than solely revolving on charity work.
I am developing my editing and marketing services to ensure the press is sustainable!

<h3>Story of LGBTQ+ Revolution 2.0 by Jill Fredenburg</h3>
<p>My name is Jill Fredenburg, and I am the author of <i>LGBTQ+ Revolution 2.0</i>!</p>
<p><strong>*EDIT* The goal of 6,000 was decided upon before COVID-19 impacted the United States. Any funds raised over $4,000 will be donated to LGBTQ+ organizations' COVID-19 initiatives!</strong></p>
<p>I wrote this book to celebrate LGBTQ+ stories and explore how identities can layer beautifully together. I was compelled to write this because I felt that, while there are so many wonderful guides to LGBTQ+ language and identity in general, I hadn’t seen a compilation of stories from queer folks. I didn’t have representation of pan and bisexuality growing up that wasn’t hugely sexualized - I barely have it now. This book attempts to do that - to bring spectrums of sexuality, gender, and romance together in one collection. </p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about the way we often talk about Bisexuality and Pansexuality, and how many people use ""Queer"" because the traditional definitions haven't worked quite right. You'll read conversations about how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asexuality is often left out of the conversation</li>
<li>It is still more difficult to be Out in certain parts of the USA </li>
<li>Queer people in a ""hetero-presenting"" relationship are still Queer</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are passionate about the LGBTQ+ community and its progressive momentum.</p>
<p><i>LGBTQ+ Revolution 2.0</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to Queer people and individuals who are looking at this huge, multifaceted community and its many layers for the first time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>LGBTQ+ Revolution 2.0</h3>
<p><br/>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/><u>Part 1</u> contains the introduction and information ""How We Got Here - LGBTQ+ History, Stories of Activism, and How Celebrity and Media Impact the Community.""<br/><br/><u>Part 2</u> details some of the issues we struggle with as a community. Coming Out is still a terrifying expectation regardless of who surrounds us. There is often a very cis and white presentation of who is an ""acceptable"" Gay person. And our obsession with vocabulary can sometimes send us into spirals of pain and confusion. Despite these problems, young Queer people are learning more every day and taking ownership of their identities. <br/><br/><u>Part 3</u> shares narratives of wonder, exploration, empowerment, and love. From questions about stirring the pot when you could easily ""pass,"" to layering Queer identity with religion, these stories capture the vivid nature of Queerness in 2020. <br/> </p>

Story of LGBTQ+ Revolution 2.0 by Jill Fredenburg

<h2>The Story - <i>Rough Edges</i>
</h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Rough Edges</i> explores themes of self-discovery and true love in a world where our online persona can sometimes feel the most real, but competes with the draw of human connection in the real world.</span></p>
<p>The story follows a small-town high school girl, Casey, who uses the world of online games and instant messaging to find a place to fit in. The screen gives her the confidence to be the person she desperately wants to be in real life, causing her to get lost in the charm of constant attention and acceptance. As time pushes ahead and she transitions to college in the city of Philadelphia, she discovers that it is just as easy to be herself without the screen. But there’s something holding her back from detaching herself from her online life; a void that would appear if that part of her were to completely dissolve. She attempts to keep both halves of herself in separate boxes, but the question is, what happens when both worlds collide? She’ll have to make a choice, if there’s even one left for her to make.</p>
<h3>The book is written in Two Parts:</h3>
<p><strong>Part One is titled Reflection.</strong> Casey will take you back in time to join her on the roller coaster that is her online romance. She battles the obsession of constant attention from the person on the other side of the screen and the fear of missing out on the experiences of her friends as they enjoy their final summer before college.<br/><br/><strong>Part Two is titled Reinvention.</strong> We jump to the present and explore themes of self-discovery and reinvention as Casey makes her way to Philadelphia—a city of over a million people where she can be whoever and whatever she wants, regardless of the private online life she keeps hidden from the real world.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>I wrote this book with hope in my heart. The experiences I’ve put in writing are some of my own and aim to take you through the highs and lows of online relationships, and the sometimes difficult task of coming back to reality. I’m telling this story to let people who have been through these experiences, and those who have not, know that there is a kindred spirit out there. Hopefully, it will make all of us feel a little less alone.<br/><br/><i>Rough Edges </i>speaks to both young and early adults who want to be transported back to the nostalgia of their high school days. The days of AOL Instant Messenger, MySpace, and the sometimes messy transition into college or adulthood. You’ll feel like you’re re-living your adolescent years along with the main character, Casey.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are a fan of Nicolas Sparks’s many love stories and thrillers, like <i>Luckiest Girl Alive, The Last Mrs. Parrish</i>, and <i>Not That I Could Tell</i>. I like to think of it as your next beach read, or perhaps next month’s book club choice.</p>
<p>When I think about the reflection and dialogue that <i>Rough Edges</i> may inspire, I hope that readers will contemplate the ideas of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our engagement and relationship with technology</li>
<li>Dating in the 21st century, specifically online dating becoming the new normal (think Tinder, Bumble, Hinge)</li>
<li>What it’s like to live a double life, whether by choice or out of necesssity</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these thoughts and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing our responses may surprise us all.<br/> </p>
