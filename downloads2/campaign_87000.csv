<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>         My name is Dillan Mitchell and I'm a singer, songwriter, and musician from Columbia, MO. Over 8 years ago, God placed a calling on my heart to write and record worship songs specifically for Him and for the Church. Finally, in His perfect timing, He is bringing these songs to fruition! Through the ministry of His Musician Pool, the professional recording cost has been cut DRAMATICALLY, saving over $10,000. It is now time to mix and master these songs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here is how these songs are brought to life.</p>
<ul>
<li>These songs will be mixed and mastered professionally by gifted and anointed audio producers with years of experience and a wealth of expertise. This will ensure a reliable experience and an extremely well done final product. </li>
<li>All in all, between recording, editing, mixing, and mastering, it should cost between $15,000 and $20,000. </li>
<li><i><strong>HOWEVER, with your help in raising $4,000, we will be saving over $15,000!!! </strong></i></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When these songs are finally mixed and mastered...</p>
<ul>
<li>The ultimate hope is that they bless the Lord and touch His heart.</li>
<li>The next hope is that these songs would minister to people in every situation and circumstance. No matter what season the listener may be in, each of these songs points to the ultimate reality of the goodness and love of God.</li>
<li>Logistically, the goal is to make these songs accessible on every major streaming platform and accessible to be sung in churches! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>         To be honest, the only challenge in bringing this to fruition is the financial aspect. The songs have all been recorded and edited, the audio producers are all ready to go, and all we need to do is raise the $4,000 for this project to finally come to life! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Maybe assisting financially is something you just can't do. Understandable! However, here are a few other ways you can help make this happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Pray. Please pray!</strong> Not simply for the funding to come in, but for the name of Jesus to be glorified in all of the earth.</li>
<li>Spread the word! By sharing this campaign on your social media pages, you are greatly increasing the potential of reaching the goal! </li>

Having been in two different bands in my 20s, my voice existed primarily through my guitar playing. But I've been pushing myself to dig deeper, branch out, and write what makes me happy - which has subsequently become The American Dream LP.

<h2><u>The True Story</u></h2>
<p>""From venues, to the streets. Shoved from numerous rehearsal spaces, Undergrooveland took their music to the streets of London in search of a new land to compose, jam and bring rock to the people. Back and forth, forth and back, developing their own style next to the daily commuters, tourists, extreme weather conditions and the strangest locations that would become their actual inspiration.<i>""</i></p>
<p>-<i>George Alan, Trumpet player.</i></p>
<p>""After having self-produced their first EP, Undergrooveland developed the confidence to travel, share their music and cut distances between the artist and the audience. Visiting new spots, meeting new crowds, that has always been the driving force of what they do. Recently they managed to organise their biggest trip to date, travelling Europe on a Busking Tour that successfully sold out all of 500+ CD’s.""</p>

<p>And so we have done, night and day; same old brush and same old canvas for us, but you, as a person, as an audience, have made the difference every time. Yes, YOU. There in the crowd making us smile and feel all connected to each other. YOU, a different person at every location, every session, every country, embracing groove and music together for that moment in time.

<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p>For a decade, Mad Anthony has been producing high-energy, emotional rock n' roll. Our mission has always been to be the band that's pushing the envelope and in 2016 we pushed it to the edge. We were tired of the write-record-release-tour-repeat routine and opted for something untraditional. For a year, we released new material every week via the internet, pushing ourselves to work harder, cross genres and collaborate with new artists. The result is <i>Mad Anthology</i>, a 52-song box set featuring contributions from dozens of the friends and colleagues we've met over our tenure.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHAT NOW</h3>
<p>Now, we're ready to bring these songs to life on a physical format. We're not wealthy by any means, so producing a 5-piece vinyl box set is not realistic. Instead, we decided to break the product into volumes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each Volume will be released on vinyl &amp; CD</li>
<li>
<i>Volume One &amp; Two</i> feature 11 songs, including 10+ collaborators on each volume</li>
<li>180 gram, collectors edition vinyl with full color packaging and images</li>
<li>Deluxe edition packaging available for collectors</li>
<li>Digital downloads of the complete Anthology</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>YOUR IMPACT</h3>
<p>Obviously, this project is quite labor intensive and expensive, but your contribution means even more than you would think.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to produce these records in the way we envision: Independent musicians often sacrifice their ideas to stay within budget, your support maintains our integrity.</li>
<li>With full funding we can afford to continue duplication of future <i>Mad Anthology: Volumes</i> but also continue creating <i>Mad Anthology</i> collaborations.</li>
<li>More media production: we're not out of ideas, and your contribution will fund future projects, including music videos and other interactive experiences.</li>
<li>Validation for the work we undertake to bring you new music in a new format</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>We're not sharing our production costs with you. We spent over $10K recording these songs and that doesn't include our time, equipment and promotion. The financial burden is only part of the challenge when undertaking a enormous production.</p>
<p>The other big sacrifice, that is often overlooked, is time away. It's not just our time recording the songs, it's time touring to make money to record, time to rehearse, time away from loved, time not relaxing on vacation and used paid time off from work. Don't get me wrong, rock n' roll is fun, but we ended up missing a lot of other things that are also important to us.</p>
<p>Finally, the biggest risk was going alone. It's huge risk to go against the grain of the music industry, there were many people who laughed in our faces when we told them our idea. Others thought (or wished) we would fail. We had multiple publicists and promoters reject us because they were afraid of taking on such a massive project. We didn't have a team of professionals to guide us through the process. We had a team of the willing who were learning the ropes along with us, to whom we are forever grateful.</p>
<h3>OTHER WAYS TO HELP</h3>

<h3>From my own children</h3>
<p>I came by it honest. I was a Dad first, then I started writing children's music for my own children and then I started performing children's music for other people's children.  I've been a professional actor, a singer, written songs and toured a great many places. I never thought I'd write and perform children's music for my living, my career, as a way to support my family, but here I am, and I love it. I've been writing children's music for the last 6 years and performed thousands of times and for 10s of thousands of children (not all at once, now). You can find me playing festivals,charity events and small private parties. I love it.  I love writing songs for my children, about the things they say, what they do and I love that it resonates with other people who have kids. To be fair, it's pretty cool to hear a bunch of under 6's and their adults singing along to a song I wrote. </p>
<p>I self produced and recorded my first two full length CD's of children's music. I played various instruments, built drum tracks and played percussion, sometimes just about alright. These two CD's were a mix of my own work and more traditional children's songs. I'm happy with them. They were a simple way to get my music out to the wider world, but also they served a very specific purpose, to provide something the children coming to my music sessions could listen to at home.</p>
<p>I endeavour to write quality music for young children, for under 8's, for babies and toddlers. They deserve good music and so do their parents and carers. When I perform, I perform for the kids. They are my audience. My goal with this campaign, this full length album, is to provide in the highest quality possible my own original music for young children. I'll produce fully realised versions of my previously recorded material as well as brand new original work and deliver it to a growing worldwide audience. </p>
<p>This campaign, fully funded, not only creates a high quality album of great children's music, the means to distribute both digitally and physically, but it provides a platform for me to bring my music to more people around the world. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The monies... </h3>
<p>Woah! 11K, That's a lot. But I don't need all of it from you. All I need is the price of a CD from you and 857.692 other people (taking into account indiegogo fees). AND, when you contribute the price of a CD, using the €13 Perk, you will get an ACTUAL CD signed by me including a free digital download of the album. You don't spend Euro's I hear you say, well, indiegogo will sort out the conversion for you. Now...</p>
<p>Where is all that money going? </p>
<ul>
<li>professional studio musicians</li>
<li>a studio engineer</li>
<li>a producer</li>
<li>a public relations person to promote/distribute album</li>
<li>promotional photo shoot</li>
<li>Digital Distribution</li>
<li>CD- Layout/graphic design</li>
<li>Physical CD manufacturing</li>
<li>CD Distribution</li>
<li>If possible- brand spankin' new video for a track off the album</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Perks</h2>
<p>In the most basic of terms, give as little or as much as you like, but I don't want you to just invest in this album, I want you to own it. If you'd like something to hold in your hand to show what you've invested in, I've come up with two perks. I like to keep things easy, so we'll start with the price of a CD and go from there. Any contribution of €13 or more will get you a signed copy of the CD and a free digital download of the album. A contribution of €50 or more will get you a signed copy, a digital download and a personalised thank you video dedicated to your child with a live performance of her/his favourite track. I'll provide a list to choose from in the perk, if you don't have either of my previous CD's you can listen to them on Spotify, iTunes, etc. There's no limit on how much you can contribute. and even the smallest amount is greatly appreciated. If you go huge, we'll sort a huge perk, but for the moment I'll keep it simple.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if I don't make the campaign goal?</strong></p>
<p>This is an 'All or Nothing' Campaign. So, if we don't reach our goal- nothing happens. </p>
<p>Investors get all their money back. Simple as. I wouldn't try to produce this album, at this quality, without being able to fund it properly. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In a very simple way, the immediate impact is that you will hold in your hand a full length album of children's music that you helped make possible. You'll be able to listen to it with your kids. You'll be dropping them at school and heading down the road for 20 minutes listening to the album alone, singing the songs, bopping along and then you'll be like 'Wait, the kids aren't in the car. I don't need to listen to this anymore.' But you will. You will because you like it too. Or maybe you won't, but at least twice a week that will happen to you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>I know not everybody is in a position to help financially</h3>
<p>but there's so much you can do without reaching into your pocket.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find your inner toddler and make some noise about the campaign</li>
<li>Share the campaign on your social media networks</li>
<li>Tell people with kids</li>
<li>Tell grandparents</li>
<li>Tell other parents</li>
<li>It makes a great gift, have someone contribute on your behalf or do the same for another</li>
<li>Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Thanks for taking the time to get this far, to read all that. I hope you'll consider making a contribution. And maybe I'll even get to sing for you. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>Kyle Riley</p></div>","From my own children

I love it.  I love writing songs for my children, about the things they say, what they do and I love that it resonates with other people who have kids. To be fair, it's pretty cool to hear a bunch of under 6's and their adults singing along to a song I wrote. 
I self produced and recorded my first two full length CD's of children's music. I played various instruments, built drum tracks and played percussion, sometimes just about alright. These two CD's were a mix of my own work and more traditional children's songs. I'm happy with them. They were a simple way to get my music out to the wider world, but also they served a very specific purpose, to provide something the children coming to my music sessions could listen to at home.
I endeavour to write quality music for young children, for under 8's, for babies and toddlers. They deserve good music and so do their parents and carers. When I perform, I perform for the kids. They are my audience. My goal with this campaign, this full length album, is to provide in the highest quality possible my own original music for young children. I'll produce fully realised versions of my previously recorded material as well as brand new original work and deliver it to a growing worldwide audience. 
This campaign, fully funded, not only creates a high quality album of great children's music, the means to distribute both digitally and physically, but it provides a platform for me to bring my music to more people around the world. 

The monies... 
Woah! 11K, That's a lot. But I don't need all of it from you. All I need is the price of a CD from you and 857.692 other people (taking into account indiegogo fees). AND, when you contribute the price of a CD, using the €13 Perk, you will get an ACTUAL CD signed by me including a free digital download of the album. You don't spend Euro's I hear you say, well, indiegogo will sort out the conversion for you. Now...
Where is all that money going? 

professional studio musicians
a studio engineer
a producer
a public relations person to promote/distribute album
promotional photo shoot
Digital Distribution
CD- Layout/graphic design
Physical CD manufacturing
CD Distribution
If possible- brand spankin' new video for a track off the album

The Perks
In the most basic of terms, give as little or as much as you like, but I don't want you to just invest in this album, I want you to own it. If you'd like something to hold in your hand to show what you've invested in, I've come up with two perks. I like to keep things easy, so we'll start with the price of a CD and go from there. Any contribution of €13 or more will get you a signed copy of the CD and a free digital download of the album. A contribution of €50 or more will get you a signed copy, a digital download and a personalised thank you video dedicated to your child with a live performance of her/his favourite track. I'll provide a list to choose from in the perk, if you don't have either of my previous CD's you can listen to them on Spotify, iTunes, etc. There's no limit on how much you can contribute. and even the smallest amount is greatly appreciated. If you go huge, we'll sort a huge perk, but for the moment I'll keep it simple.
What happens if I don't make the campaign goal?
This is an 'All or Nothing' Campaign. So, if we don't reach our goal- nothing happens. 
Investors get all their money back. Simple as. I wouldn't try to produce this album, at this quality, without being able to fund it properly. 

The Impact
In a very simple way, the immediate impact is that you will hold in your hand a full length album of children's music that you helped make possible. You'll be able to listen to it with your kids. You'll be dropping them at school and heading down the road for 20 minutes listening to the album alone, singing the songs, bopping along and then you'll be like 'Wait, the kids aren't in the car. I don't need to listen to this anymore.' But you will. You will because you like it too. Or maybe you won't, but at least twice a week that will happen to you.

I know not everybody is in a position to help financially
but there's so much you can do without reaching into your pocket.

Find your inner toddler and make some noise about the campaign
Share the campaign on your social media networks
Tell people with kids
Tell grandparents
Tell other parents
It makes a great gift, have someone contribute on your behalf or do the same for another
Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!

Thanks for taking the time to get this far, to read all that. I hope you'll consider making a contribution. And maybe I'll even get to sing for you. All the best,Kyle Riley",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We cannot express enough how important releasing this record in such a high-quality, commemorative format is for all of us. We have spent years struggling to get these songs recorded, bouncing between studios, existing between practice spaces, and dealing with the loss of loved ones along the way has made this record a deep reflection upon the hardest of times and the vindication that comes with completing a body of work that represents all of these emotions.</p>
<p>Our campaign goal is $3,000. It sounds like a lot, because it is, but every penny counts. From pressing to shipping, vinyl records are an expensive endeavor, but the final product is absolutely worth the effort. All of the money we receive from this campaign is going directly towards the pressing of this vinyl. The final product will be a high-quality 180 gram 12” white vinyl with a “fake out” gatefold jacket. The artwork for <i>Existence</i> is being painted by renowned local artist Christian Degn Petersen.</p>

<p>This recording project means a lot to us because:</p>
<p>1. It will help bring our quirky lit-pop songs to all-new audiences. As you probably know, much of our music celebrates misunderstood and maligned characters from history and literature. Just because they're pariahs, outlaws and weirdos doesn't mean we can't take a moment to stand in their shoes. Maybe the world would be a better place if we all did more of that.  </p>
<p>2. Having a recording with our full band will help bookers and other industry folk connect with our current sound, so we can take our music to new venues. We're ready to keep on keeping Portland weird.</p>
<p>3. And, finally, it will enable us to produce versions of our songs that would be difficult (or impossible) to achieve live in a bar (as much as we do love playing in bars). So expect more textural details and aural goodies! Hear the songs the way we've always wanted them to be heard. (And maybe be able to actually hear all the lyrics - ha!)</p>
<p>Your donations will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio sessions &amp; recording engineer time, with the amazing Sean Flora</li>

<p>How many songs we're able to complete will have a lot to do with how much support we're able to raise for this effort.  We've already laid tracks for four songs. Whatever you are able to donate will help us finish these and more! We expect to have the recordings complete later this fall.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Dimitri Scarlato, and I am a freelance composer and conductor who works in contemporary classic music, opera and films/theatre.</p>
<p>I have a huge passion for opera, especially contemporary opera and I was lucky enough to have 2 of my own operas fully staged and produced. That is why last January 2016, I launched the Stara Zagora Opera Competition for composers, stage directors and singers, to reach out to young talented artists. This competition has been supported by the Stara Zagora Opera House in Bulgaria, thanks to its artistic director Ognian Dragonoff. </p>
<p>An international panel of composers, conductors and stage directors, has discovered some very gifted composers, singers and young stage directors. We have selected 3 new operas, which will be premiered on the 22nd March 2017 at the Stara Zagora Opera House.</p>
<p>The  3 operas are based on social issues of our contemporaneity.</p>
<ul><li>If you would support this project you would help emerging artists to realise their dream of being part of a new operatic project, you would give the unique opportunity to composers to see their operas fully stage in a theatre. There are many talented people who have not the chance to showcase their skills and their creativity because of a lack of opportunities. That is why your contribution would be vital to nurture these talents!</li></ul>

<li>
<strong>Additional set design and costumes expenses</strong>. Estimated price £700</li>
<li>
<strong>Indiegogo fees</strong>. Estimated price £600</li>
</ol>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We have devised lots of operatic perks for you, which you can also use for a friend or a person you care about!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The funds will still go towards all the costs described above, even if we don't hit the main target. But with your help we can reach the £6000 target!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you are passionate about contemporary music, singing, and opera, then your donation could have a huge impact on the career of those emerging artists, who are developing their craft!

on U.S. Power Metal bands that would benefit from additional exposure to a
wider audience.  We distribute these CDs
for free at major festivals and shows and provide a large number of copies to
the participating bands to hand out at local shows, thus spreading the music
across the United States and Canada. We do not accept money from the bands
selected for each year – they provide their best new track, and we make sure we
get it to as many ears as possible.</p>
<p>We started in 2014 as a self-funded organization,
producing 300 copies out of our own pockets. 
In 2015, with a simple donation campaign spread by word of mouth, we
were able to produce 600 copies, including 200 that were distributed at
ProgPower USA's infamous afterparties and by Divebomb Records. This year, we’re shooting for the
moon and hoping to produce at least 1500 copies, with every dollar raised going
to making more CDs.</p>
<p><b><i>Any perks (including shirts, all CD shipping, and meals) and
the artwork costs are paid out of our own pockets, leaving every dollar
contributed going to the production of even more CDs, which means more
discs to hand out and more for the bands themselves to use to promote the
scene.</i></b></p>

</div>","(Update: WOW.  We hoped to make our goal by the end of the 60 day period.  We never expected that everyone would exceed our target within 4 days!  We are filled with gratitude and can't thank all of you enough.  No specific stretch goals - any further contributions will simply go to making more copies for the bands!  Thanks again - you are all completely awesome!)A Flame In The Dark is a yearly compilation CD, focusing
on U.S. Power Metal bands that would benefit from additional exposure to a
wider audience.  We distribute these CDs
for free at major festivals and shows and provide a large number of copies to
the participating bands to hand out at local shows, thus spreading the music
across the United States and Canada. We do not accept money from the bands
selected for each year – they provide their best new track, and we make sure we
get it to as many ears as possible.
We started in 2014 as a self-funded organization,
producing 300 copies out of our own pockets. 
In 2015, with a simple donation campaign spread by word of mouth, we
were able to produce 600 copies, including 200 that were distributed at
ProgPower USA's infamous afterparties and by Divebomb Records. This year, we’re shooting for the
moon and hoping to produce at least 1500 copies, with every dollar raised going
to making more CDs.
Any perks (including shirts, all CD shipping, and meals) and
the artwork costs are paid out of our own pockets, leaving every dollar
contributed going to the production of even more CDs, which means more
discs to hand out and more for the bands themselves to use to promote the
scene.
Some of your favorite bands that have benefited from the
previous releases of A Flame In The Dark? Seven Kingdoms, A Sound Of Thunder, Enceladus,
Tanagra, Everthrone, Helion Prime, Infidel Rising, Automation, Forevers’ Fallen

<p>For those who are familiar with my music, and those who aren't - I've been playing instrumental acoustic guitar or ""Fingerstyle"" far longer than I've been singing, writing traditional/pop songs and even gigging professionally! I am <strong><u>extremely</u></strong> excited to finally release a complete 10-track album featuring the songs I think best represent the last few years' writing sessions and life experiences. I would say without a doubt that this record is the most important to me out of the 3 I have now composed, and it's arrival has been in the back of my mind since 2011 when I first began this journey of pursuing the craft of writing deep, inspiring, soulful, acoustic music. It's been my dream to work with the folks at the top of their fields that helped produce this album: Kim Person (Tommy Emmanuel, Stephen Bennett) and Sean De Burca (CandyRat Records), but for it to finally be released I will need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>What I Need &amp; What You Get</u></h3>
<p>For my campaign I am basically hoping to recover <i>half</i> of the total cost of this album's production in efforts to help smooth out the ""final stretch"" costs of production and hopefully rent a venue for the release party! My plan was to release ""Woodscapes"" worldwide in March but now it looks like it's official release date will be April 15th. Production costs ended up being outside my original budget and post-production will take a bit longer to finish than expected so I want to offer pre-release CD's and digital downloads to those who contribute to this campaign as a special ""Thank you"" for all the support!</p>
<p>Contributors will receive their CD's/downloads in the mail or via email just after the campaign is finished on April 1st. (No April Fool's jokes here!) while the worldwide release online will be April 15th.</p>
<h3><u>​About the Album:</u></h3>
<p>Working with Kim Person, Mike Monseur and Sean De Burca has been nothing short of a dream! When I first listened to ""The Mystery"" by Tommy Emmanuel and ""Ten"" by Stephen Bennett I was just as inspired by the warm, resonant quality of the audio as I was their playing. I think Kim and I nailed something reminiscent of that sound but also unique, thanks to her impeccable knack for capturing the individual artist's ""soul"" and their guitar's unique tonal qualities. There are 6 brand new tracks and 4 ""reimagined"" tracks of some old favorites fans will recognize that are in different tunings!</p>
<p>While I actually made the graphics/CD covers for my first two releases with Pixlr and the contribution of some great local photographers - I knew this one HAD to be done right. If you're familiar with the modern-fingerstyle genre you're probably also acquainted with the work of Sean De Burca - whether you knew it or not. He is the designer for a majority of CandyRat Records' artwork and many other virtuoso artists pursuing high-quality music and production. It's been an honor and a privilege to work with him! </p>

<h3><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h3>
<p>With the music business being what it is today, if you're not a pop-star or viral-success-prodigy then streaming music payments like those from Spotify, Apple Music and Pandora don't provide anywhere near the amount of funds needed for a project of this scale, so I am asking for your support to either pre-order 'Woodscapes' or take an even larger role and donate extra!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After self releasing an EP and a mixtape, touring as a solo singer-songwriter, and working as a featured artist on projects by other artists, I am now diving into releasing a full album of my own. These songs are intimate, vulnerable, and personal, although some focus on social and political issues. They illuminate a woman’s perspective of a society slowly shifting away from toxic masculinity. </p>
<ul>
<li>I am a singer-songwriter, producer, educator and performing artist; jazz trained, hip-hop educated, and influenced by my Jewish roots. I have studied with master musicians of both American and world music genres, master poets and theater makers. I've toured nationally and internationally as a solo theater artist, singer-songwriter and backup singer for world renowned artists. I grew up dancing professionally in world folk dance and music ensemble and have decades of experience bridging the gap between professional and community art scenes centered in empowerment and social justice. I hold a BA in art and social change from Hampshire College and an MFA in music and theater from CIIS.<a href=""http://www.sariyahidan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> www.sariyahidan.com</a>
</li>
<li>This campaign will help fund the completion of my debut full length album as a singer-songwriter and producer.</li>
<li>BREAKING SHADOWS is huge milestone for me personally and professionally. While I have produced other artistic projects BREAKING SHADOWS is the articulation of a vision I've held since I was a young girl. The recording will be finished predominantly in Berlin and Portugal where it is more cost effective for me to complete this process with high quality production and where local musicians are skilled in the genres I am blending. </li>

<li>THE MONEY: We need $8000 to finish recording and mixing the music. The additional $5000 will go towards a publicist, creating at least one music video and one performance projection to add visual components to the project, manufacture a short run of CDs and other merch.</li>
<li>ABOUT THE GOAL: If we do not make the $13,000 goal it will simply take longer to finish the album. I'm committed to making it happen.

<h3>Help Ayomilly Launch His Debut Album!</h3>
<p>My name is Joel Craig, otherwise known as Ayomilly. I'm an independent recording artist from Toronto, who is passionate about creating honest music that has a positive impact on our culture and in the lives of my listeners. I’ve been making music since I was fifteen years old. Now, I’m twenty-one and I am finally ready to release my first studio album!<br/><br/>My goal with this campaign is to raise funds to help launch my debut project this November. The album has already been recorded, but I will need your help to finish it. Your donation will cover the cost of professional engineering, artwork, distribution, and promotion. Most importantly, you will be joining me in my mission to produce art that will have a positive influence on our society. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The main expense that I need your help with is the cost of high-quality studio engineering. To complete my album, I will need each song to be professionally mixed and mastered. This will cost <strong>$3500 CAD</strong>. If I reach this main goal, I will have a stretch goal of <strong>$5000 CAD</strong>. These funds will cover the cost of the professional engineering of my project as well as the promotion for my album and the live-stream release event. </p>
<p><i><strong>Here is a breakdown of the estimated expenses for my album:</strong></i></p>
<p><i>Mixing &amp; Mastering: </i><u>$3500 CAD</u><br/><i>Social Media Promotion:</i><u> $1900 CAD</u><br/><u><strong><i>Total:</i> $5400</strong></u></p>
<p>There are serval perks that you will receive if you choose to donate to my campaign, such as a digital copy of my album, some shoutouts, exclusive merch, and even the chance to write a bar for a future song! You can check out the perks section of my campaign for more details.  </p>
<p>If I do not reach my target goal, your donations will still be used to help cover the cost of mixing and mastering my album. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My main challenge has been finding the right engineer to mix my music. I need someone who shares my vision and my passion for my versatile sound. Luckily, I have found a great man for the job. <br/><br/>Another challenge is, of course, the COVID19 pandemic. My dream was to launch this project with a concert, but because of restrictions that is not a possibility anymore. Instead, I would rather invest in promotion so that my music can reach more listeners. I also had plans to visit the United States this year to coordinate with artists there who share my vision. I still have plans to do this, but, for now, I have been able to use social media to meet other artists who love making music that speaks to a higher purpose. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Your contribution to my campaign will mean so much to me, but your overall support will impact my goals even more. There are still so many ways to support me without donating. The main way to do this is to stream and share my music. Another way is to let people in your circle know about my campaign. You can use the Indiegogo share tools to do this. This will help me out just as much as a donation. </p>
<p>I am so thankful for those who have already been supporting me on my journey. I'm thankful that you have taken the time to read this page. I hope that you will consider joining me in my dream to produce uplifting music. </p>

</div></div>","Help Ayomilly Launch His Debut Album!
My name is Joel Craig, otherwise known as Ayomilly. I'm an independent recording artist from Toronto, who is passionate about creating honest music that has a positive impact on our culture and in the lives of my listeners. I’ve been making music since I was fifteen years old. Now, I’m twenty-one and I am finally ready to release my first studio album!My goal with this campaign is to raise funds to help launch my debut project this November. The album has already been recorded, but I will need your help to finish it. Your donation will cover the cost of professional engineering, artwork, distribution, and promotion. Most importantly, you will be joining me in my mission to produce art that will have a positive influence on our society. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
The main expense that I need your help with is the cost of high-quality studio engineering. To complete my album, I will need each song to be professionally mixed and mastered. This will cost $3500 CAD. If I reach this main goal, I will have a stretch goal of $5000 CAD. These funds will cover the cost of the professional engineering of my project as well as the promotion for my album and the live-stream release event. 
Here is a breakdown of the estimated expenses for my album:
Mixing & Mastering: $3500 CADSocial Media Promotion: $1900 CADTotal: $5400
There are serval perks that you will receive if you choose to donate to my campaign, such as a digital copy of my album, some shoutouts, exclusive merch, and even the chance to write a bar for a future song! You can check out the perks section of my campaign for more details.  
If I do not reach my target goal, your donations will still be used to help cover the cost of mixing and mastering my album. 
 

The Impact
As I said, my goal as an artist is to create honest content that will bring positivity and hope to my listeners. My songs are heavily inspired by my faith and my story. This project is a testimony of how my faith rescued me from a life of hopelessness. By sharing my life through my music, I hope that others like me will realize their need to find hope and purpose in something greater than the things of this world. By contributing to my campaign, you will be joining me in my mission to produce art that will create a positive change in our culture.

<h3>Hello, my name's Ricky and I'm a musician based in London. </h3>
<p>I've wanted to make a full album for many years now, having only released EPs in the past. I wanted to hear all those other instruments that I could hear in my head when writing the songs.</p>
<p>This has finally been achieved (nearly 4 yrs in the making)  and its now really important to me that these songs are heard and the album given its best chance possible out there in the world!</p>
<p>Your help with this would be absolutely invaluable  &amp; appreciated. Making this record has been a very collaborative process and it feels right to continue in that collaborative vein, I'd love for you to come on board and share the experience with me. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>So, now the album has been recorded and mixed, but the expense doesn't end there unfortunately. I've managed to finance things myself so far  but now need help with some of the most expensive aspects of making an album, the mastering, marketing, manufacturing and also touring. I'll break down some of the costs ..</li>
<li>
<strong>Mastering </strong>- <strong>£160 per hour</strong> (And to master the album will take around 6 hours) So allowing for over running, potential amendments etc .. we're looking at<strong> £1000 </strong>.. There are cheaper mastering engineers out there but we wanted to go for the very best to bring out the dynamic elements of the album and so we have chosen the legendary <strong><a href=""https://www.digido.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bob Katz</a></strong>!</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing</strong> (PR - Press) - <strong>£400 - </strong>Invaluable help that goes beyond the norm for PR from the very lovely <b><a href=""http://jasmine.laura.robinson@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jasmine Robinson</a></b>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Manufacturing</strong> - So we want a physical representation of the album and while there will be a small batch of <strong>CDs</strong> (Costing around <strong>£200</strong>) this format is becoming less popular, however, the  flip side is a rise in the popularity of vinyl, which is great .. but .. its very expensive. I've been quoted <strong>£1500</strong> for a batch of 300. The music will of course also be available digitally. </li>
<li>We have some beautiful artwork for the front of the album (Which I'll be talking a bit more about later) but I'm also hiring someone to design the reverse side of the album and to ensure all is correct and ready for physical release at the cost of <strong>£100</strong>
</li>
<li>As you can see, the costs quickly mount up<strong> </strong>and that brings the <strong>total </strong>up to <strong>£3200 </strong>(Gulp) It would be absolutely amazing if we can hit this target and in the 'miraculous situation' that we managed to go past the target then any further funds would go towards 'musicians fees' to join me on the <strong>album launch show </strong>and subsequent <strong>tour</strong>. </li>
<li>So, as well as simply pre-ordering the album in one of its forms there's also lots of great perks on offer, including signed prints of the album artwork (See above) by the amazingly talented and renowned artist <a href=""https://www.dariahlazatova.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Daria Hlazatova</a> .. Also, <strong>House concerts, An acoustic song written &amp; recorded for you, your child, your dog or whoever you like really and more!! </strong>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div><ul>
<li>I'm extremely proud of this album. It's by far the best thing I will have ever released and of course I'd like to hope that many of you will also share my enthusiasm for the project.</li>
<li>We've tried to create an album that perhaps in some ways harks back to the way music often sounded some decades ago. The songs I write are often pretty <strong>dynamic and non-standard </strong>in their style &amp; we wanted to try and capture those elements on this record. We wanted to retain the <strong>eclectic and sometimes unusual musical style</strong> in which they were written, to really come through. </li>
<li> Although I believe in the open interpretation of art, there are some fairly clear <strong>themes and important messages</strong> I think that come through on this album. </li>
</ul></div><div>

<h3>Making Music More Accessible</h3>
<p>The heavy metal and rock music genres have some highly aesthetic songs, of which people who avoid the genres are unknowingly depriving themselves.  By arranging acoustic cover versions of these hidden gems, we can help more people have access to the experiences they're missing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Your Funds Help Provide</h3>
<p>Making a high-quality, highly technical recording takes a lot of effort by a lot of folks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording studio engineers</li>
<li>Other musicians in the recording</li>
<li>Mastering helps make albums sound their best</li>
<li>The original songwriters deserve their royalties, too!</li>
</ul>
<p>All the above costs about $250 per song, some more, some less.  With 16 songs in total planned for the album, that comes to $4,000.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What you'll get for backing the project</h3>
<ul>
<li>Everyone giving $10+ will receive a pre-release digital copy of the album.</li>
<li>Backers giving $25+ may receive a limited edition CD if we have 50 or more backers at this level of patronage.</li>
<li>For $250, you (or your company) will be listed as the sponsor of one of the songs.</li>
<li>Or, if you have another option, feel free to contact Danny directly at narcolepianist@hotmail.com </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why is Danny the right person to make this project happen?</h3>
<p>The simple answer is, I have the right set of skills for the task.  The longer answer is:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have been a masters degree-level music therapist for over a decade</li>
<li>I am trained as a vocalist, instrumentalist, conductor, and composer</li>
<li>I have performed as a soloist, in choirs, musicals, operas, barbershop quartets, bands, Carnegie Hall, recording studios, music videos... the list continues.  (If you have a sharp eye, you may have even seen me performing in a show currently on Netflix.)</li>
<li>I have published continuing education on advanced lyric analysis and am also an author and editor, so I really know impactful lyrics when I hear them!</li>
<li>I've put out multiple albums already, including the most recent one funded by crowdsourcing, so I know how to see a project through to completion.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>You can help without donating!</h3>
<p>If you know of someone who would enjoy hearing or backing this album, simply let them know of its existence!  Also, if you have an acquaintance who is a music blogger, a rock magazine journalist who is looking for an unusual story, or the like -- same thing; win-win!</p>

PRESS RELEASE:BREAKING BOUNDARIES WITH THE NEW CD 'SEVENTH HOUR'



Canada's Top Touring Bluesman, JW-Jones is moving up with a boundary breaking CD.

On his 7th release, aptly titled 'Seventh Hour', Jones has teamed up with multi-Juno award winning artist/producer, Steve Dawson, to mix the album.
 
Previous releases have featured legendary guests Hubert Sumlin (Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters) and David ""Fathead"" Newman (Ray Charles); heavy-hitters Kim Wilson (Fabulous Thunderbirds) and Charlie Musselwhite; two of the most innovative guitarists of our time, Little Charlie Baty and Junior Watson; and Canadian billboard favorite, Colin James.  Jones has cut records from Hollywood to Sun Studios in Memphis.
 
Guitar World Magazine featured a CD called â€˜Guitar Masters Vol. 2â€™ that put Jones alongside guitar stars B.B. King, Jimmy Page, and Carlos Santana among others, and he recently landed an endorsement deal with Gibson guitars.
 
After performing in 17 countries, 4 continents, and releasing 6 critically acclaimed discs, it's time for a change.  No famous guests.  No fancy studios.  This is JW-Jones and his band doing what they do best - right at home, recorded in J-Dub's living room by his go-to engineer for the last decade, Jason Jaknunas.  Tracked on a crisp fall weekend, this cool release is sure to stir up some discussion about where his music is going as he soars in a vibrant new direction. 
 
Shattering visual boundaries is also an integral part of this project.  Art director and commercial photographer Mitch Lenet (Panasonic, Subaru, Bell), has developed a concept for this package with cutting edge technology that is guaranteed to turn heads in the music and fashion world.  Cyrus Hogg brings it all to life with the graphic design.
 
While keeping one foot firmly planted in the roots he came from, Jones believes that appealing to a younger audience is the most important way to ensure the evolution of blues-based music.
 
And without further adieu, here it is folks... 'Seventh Hour'.  Play It loud.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Jennifer Athena Galatis a composer for films, general media and classical music. I studied music at the prestigious Julliard school of music in New York with professor Oxana Yablonskaya.I have composed a collection of pieces five in total for four hands piano entitled A Conversation with Philip Glass and I want to record them at the Chapelle Historique du Bon Pasteur which is a concert hall in Montreal Canada. It will be my dream to record there because the hall owns a Fazioli piano. We only have two in Canada. Fazioli is like a Stradivarius for piano and a very rare instrument to play on. Along with the Conversations I would like to record two studies that I composed in January 2011. Besides recording I want to invite free of charge students of any age to be part of the recording in order for them to experience the Fazioli sound. The recording is set for  May 24th 2011. My goal here is to get 1000$ in order to hire a sound engineer for two hours. After the recording is complete I will publish the music in ITunes.<br/></p>
<p>I will personally fund the rental of the concert hall but I am hoping to raise more money in order to hire a sound engineer and rent any recording equipment necessary.</p>
<p>My real goal here is to expose classical music to a younger audience. I also would like them to play the fazioli piano after recording.<br/></p>

<h3>""...a more diverse take on Americana with a distinctly female tone, and quite charming."" —<em> East Bay Express</em>
</h3>
<h3>Hello and thanks for your interest in my work! Please make a donation to my latest project!</h3>
<p>Over the past decade, I've recorded two EPs and two full-length CDs — 'Adding Water To Ashes' (2008) and '2010' — and been fortunate to have the opportunity to perform with a host of great musicians throughout California and the US. Now I'm partway through recording my latest release and am asking your support in taking it to completion. Please make a donation today and you'll be the first to receive the new tunes as well as special perks and benefits.</p>
<p>The songs I'm currently recording were written over the last three years of playing, writing, performing and traveling (including two several-month-long forays to India to study yoga and Carnatic voice). I think is my best work yet. Exploring faith, relationship, lineage and legacy, I'm enthused about this collection both for its lyrical content and the chance it's giving me fill in my Americana palette that much more. And I'm thrilled to be working with noted jazz artist and composer Art Khu — whose played on previous recordings — in the producer chair.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: leftt;""><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>

<p>Thank you for checking out our Indiegogo page! We are The Good Fight; a rock band out of Northern Virginia. We have been writing and playing shows for over a year now. During that time we have recorded and produced demos of our own music to build a local fanbase. We are now ready to take this band to the next level. A big part of that will be nationally releasing a high quality debut album. In order to do this we will need your help. Recording, mixing and mastering are all expensive and time consuming. We are willing and able to commit as much time as necessary to this process, but do not have the funds readily available. Our goal is to record with Paul Levitt out of Maryland. He has worked with artists we love such as Circa Survive, Senses Fail, The Bled, All Time Low, The Dangerous Summer, etc. With your help we can work in this state of the art recording facility and have the opportunity to release an amazing album.</p>
</div>
<p>Your contribution will help us not only record, mix and master our music, but also help us take the next step as a band. Once this CD is released we will be able to get out of Northen VA and hopefully into a city near you. We know that this is the next step in the evolution of our band.</p>
<p>We know that not everyone has extra money that they can put into this campaign, but if you could help us spread the word that would be just as helpful! Thanks again for checking out this page and feel free to hit us up on Facebook.</p>

<p>Yo.  I am <strong>Pablo</strong> <strong>aka “Beaner”</strong> aka “Skirtchaser” aka “El Frijolero” etc. I am an internationally working musician and dj who has enjoyed a modicum of success, but who doesn’t like what has happened to the musical landscape vis-a-vis “conservatism” in respect to both Money and Art.  I mean the relationship of the two, okay? It sucks. And I want to change it.<br/><br/>This is <strong>Mandie</strong> (yo)<strong> aka “Knuckle Cartel”</strong>, a former big cheese and intellectual powerhouse behind the wildly successful Seattle-based experimental theater company Implied Violence.  I, Mandie, agree with Pablo’s qualms regarding the music scene, and I have experienced the same “conservatism” and capitalistic partnership between Money and Art in the performance/theater scene.  Witnessing firsthand the immense power that cash-wielding creeps hold over creatives is sickening, sad, and sordid.  I’ve had enough, and so have you...right?  Let’s fix a broken system.  If we can’t fix it, let’s circumvent it.</p>
<p>Hiya. it's <strong>Luis</strong> aka <strong>""LMGM.""</strong> I'm a dancer, a writer, a scholar (and an amazing cook of Peruvian food, thankyouverymuch). Somehow, I've turned my years of experience in rave scenes and club cultures into a career as a scholar of electronic booty-shaking music (so to speak). Ethnomusicology, music anthropology, popular music studies, dance studies, gender studies, affect theory: these are all things i do in one way or another. Ever since disco crashed under the exploitative mismanagement of major record labels in the late 70s, dance music has been increasingly shaped by capitalist music markets that only recognize familiar ""pop"" formulae and massive sales. In the process, electronic booty-shaking music has mostly lost its connection to its original contexts. This music was (and, on some dance-floors, still is) the ass-jiggling soundtrack to the utopian nocturnal worlds of sexual, ethnic, and class outcasts of an unjust system. This history is still urgently relevant, as global neo-liberal capital systems increasingly destabilize communities, neutralize political resistance, and profit off the world's most vulnerable. I want to revive and revisit the politics of booty-shaking in an unjust world.  </p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND &amp; CONCEPT</strong></p>
<p>In every musical genre EXCEPT for electronic booty shaking music, vinyl sales are up.  In dance music, however, vinyl sales have been steadily dropping, forcing most labels to either fold or become more and more musically and conceptually conservative. This economic reality has left artists who make music that is not easily consumable or disposable up shit creek (so to say).. Self-releasing your music is not easy, people. ALSO the dance music scene (which has its roots in minority identity politics and the politics of resistance) has become a slovenly, hedonistic, individualist capital venture-cum- nightmare. So. Two birds with one stone. You’ve heard the saying.  <strong>We, La Mission, want to prove there are other ways to make, release and love music that are not about the accumulation and maintenance of capital.</strong>  Eventually we hope to inspire cultural, political, and social offshoots of La Mission.   We want to see OTHER people following our production model.  You can help us jump-start the movement by first helping us to actualize our dream project.  How?  Easy.  Join the Cult of La Mission.</p>

<p><strong>CROWDFUNDING</strong></p>
<p>Right now, crowd funding helps make a lot of dream projects happen.  That's because there aren't any middlemen there to determine what they think people actually want. There is no insidious profiling (PROFIT MONGERING) or archetyping going on; it's just creative people working hard to give people who appreciate their work what they want on their own terms. Crowdfunding is a socially conscious, new method of developing creative communities and raising money for projects without the rules, regulations, depressing beggary, or the rampant compromising of morals/ideals in favor of a chunk of change from governmental granting organizations and money-hungry production companies. As such, it is the ideal platform on which La Mission can introduce itself to potential consumers (blech), supporters, participants, and fellow creatives and intellectuals (double blech).  <em>ATTENTION: Most of this past paragraph was stolen directly from successful crowdfunders ‘Project Possum’.

Well, you walked past that guy and his sad little dog and have felt guilty about it ever since. Don't. This is your opportunity to make it better. La Mission is the personification of that guy and his dog, only when you give us money we are going to use it to help change a broken system. So there wont be more brain damaged, off kilter dogs, and that guy might not be blind anymore either. Somehow.

WE ARE LA MISSION
Yo.  I am Pablo aka “Beaner” aka “Skirtchaser” aka “El Frijolero” etc. I am an internationally working musician and dj who has enjoyed a modicum of success, but who doesn’t like what has happened to the musical landscape vis-a-vis “conservatism” in respect to both Money and Art.  I mean the relationship of the two, okay? It sucks. And I want to change it.This is Mandie (yo) aka “Knuckle Cartel”, a former big cheese and intellectual powerhouse behind the wildly successful Seattle-based experimental theater company Implied Violence.  I, Mandie, agree with Pablo’s qualms regarding the music scene, and I have experienced the same “conservatism” and capitalistic partnership between Money and Art in the performance/theater scene.  Witnessing firsthand the immense power that cash-wielding creeps hold over creatives is sickening, sad, and sordid.  I’ve had enough, and so have you...right?  Let’s fix a broken system.  If we can’t fix it, let’s circumvent it.
Hiya. it's Luis aka ""LMGM."" I'm a dancer, a writer, a scholar (and an amazing cook of Peruvian food, thankyouverymuch). Somehow, I've turned my years of experience in rave scenes and club cultures into a career as a scholar of electronic booty-shaking music (so to speak). Ethnomusicology, music anthropology, popular music studies, dance studies, gender studies, affect theory: these are all things i do in one way or another. Ever since disco crashed under the exploitative mismanagement of major record labels in the late 70s, dance music has been increasingly shaped by capitalist music markets that only recognize familiar ""pop"" formulae and massive sales.

<h3><em>Do you hunger to make a real difference in the world?</em></h3>
<p>Are you frightened by and tired of all the violence in the world? The school shootings? The terrorist attacks? The murdered spouses? The rapes? The cruelty to animals?</p>
<p>Do you feel hopeless and helpless about making a dent in the problem? </p>
<p>I'm CJ Scarlet and I believe I have a solution--10 in fact.</p>
<p>I am creating a company called <strong>10 for Humanity</strong> that will develop 10 technologies to reduce violence globally by 10% in 10 years. Yes, I said ""technologies"". Why? Because emerging technologies are changing our world faster than you can say ""Oh crap! Where's my phone?!!"", and it is the future of our world.</p>
<p>Do you believe that in 25 years we will have found a way to decrease violence around the world? Well, if we're going to get there, we've got to start HERE. NOW.</p>
<h3><em><strong>Who Am I to Believe I Can Change the World?</strong></em></h3>
<p>Who am I NOT to do it? Who WE are (you and me) is reflected in the world around us. Changing the world isn't a choice... it's a responsibility.</p>
<p>And I'm just the person to help you do it. I was the victim of sexual violence and suffered for decades from the results. I've spent most of my career as a victim advocate and I hold an interdisciplinary master's degree in Human Violence. When I was Director of Victims Issues for the NC Attorney General's Office, I initiated and co-chaired the implementation of the nation's first Statewide Automated Victim Notification System--a technological solution that notified crime victims by phone before their perpetrators were released from custody. This system was chosen as the national model by the US Dept. of Justice. I am also a geek and futurist with an abiding fascination for all things technology. (Please see my LinkedIn profile at <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/rovingcoach"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.linkedin.com/in/rovingcoach</a>)</p>
<p>I've dealt with violence at every level, but I'm sick of reacting to it;<strong> I'm ready to do something to keep it from happening at all.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>But I need your help.</strong></em> I am honored to have been chosen to attend the summer graduate program at Singulary U (a think tank for people who are using technology to solve grand global challenges like hunger and poverty) (<a href=""http://www.singularityu.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.singularityu.org</a>). While in the program, and afterwards as an alumna, I will learn about emerging technologies and make connections with people and organizations who will help me come up with ideas for and apply 10 technological solutions, and who will connect me to investors for the larger funds I'll need.</p>
<p>Until then, I need your help to raise $35,000 in start-up funds to begin the important work of launching the company. Funds will be used to help cover my tuition at Singularity University, develop a website and business materials, design the crowdsourcing campaign, travel to/from Singularity University and operating costs.</p>

<h3><em>How You Can Help Launch 10 for Humanity</em></h3>
<p>I am seeking $35,000 to cover the start-up costs for the company, including building a website, developing business collateral (business cards, etc.), paying an intern to design the crowdsourcing campaign, tuition and travel expenses to/from Raleigh NC to Silicon Valley CA, to attend SU, and general operating costs (printer ink, paper, Internet services, etc.).</p>
<p>When YOU make this happen, the world gets that much closer to real solutions to the frighteningly real challenge of human violence.</p>
<p>In return for your generous contribution, you will receive free perks that range from getting a seat at the table as we brainstorm solutions (and, if one of your ideas is used, you'll be nicely compensated!), to a coaching session with CJ Scarlet, to gaining a coveted spot on her advisory board! </p>

<p class=""Formatlibre""><strong>Our story!</strong></p>
<p class=""Formatlibre"">2011 &amp; 2012 have been great years for all of us here with Forus. We've played more shows than ever, traveled to places we've never been, met some amazing and wonderful people and continued to follow our dream of writing and performing great music «for us»… and you ;)</p>
<p class=""Formatlibre"">One thing that truly has kept us going, though, is your enduring and never-ending support. We've seen more and more people coming out to a show for the first time (or 10th time, maybe 20th..), belting out lyrics, offering us a place to stay, and even making food, sex and musical instruments for us! All of that serves as fuel; gets us up in the morning, inspires to keep driving on those long trips in the vans, trains, planes and ultimately reminds us of the large place in your life our music holds.</p>
<p class=""Formatlibre"">After performing 70 shows crossing over thousand miles in France, Spain, Holland, Belgium, Germany, Russia, we're spending the months of June and July of 2013 with Christian Carvin &amp; J.P Chalbos at their famous studios in France, recording our new album. The next record will feature a mix of road-tested and new never-before-heard material and is slated for an October release date. But in order for anyone to hear it we need YOUR help! </p>

<p class=""Formatlibre""><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""Formatlibre""><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p class=""Formatlibre"">To put out our new record we need in totality more than $15,000. That may sound like a lot but consider this: for a full length ten track album it will cost roughly $1000 per track to record from start to finish. It will cost an additional one to two thousand dollars to print and package in addition to feeding ourselves while we are recording and the gas to get to and from the studio. All in all when recording in the studio the expenses add up quickly. Here, we're requesting a minimum of $12,000 to ensure a down payment on the studio but we hope we can earn the whole amount here from the support of our family, friends and fans.</p>
<p class=""Formatlibre""> </p>
<p class=""Formatlibre""><strong>What you get</strong></p>
<p class=""Formatlibre"">Now, to the prizes! There are 10 different perks listed to the right with a different perk for each contribution amount. We've racked our brains and come up with some great prizes that <strong>all include a download from the new album</strong> before its October release date! You can also receive hand-written lyrics, tee shirts, caps, vinyls, guitar lessons, Forus iPod nano with our entire discography (plus some extreme rarities), the limited edition Forus skateboard, guitar,…</p>

<p>The car won't start, and the moon is waxing full. You look up at the stars. They resemble headlights. Where are you? Do you belong here? You feel an intense desire to move, but you can't. You are rooted to the spot. You hear something calling your name. The wind, an old lover, your mother when you were just a little kid. If you could turn your head, you might know the answer. But the stars hold your gaze. You are already home. You have been dreaming for hours.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Mystics Anonymous is the name of my musical project, best defined as eclectic independent rock. With Mystics, the whole point was to establish a project where nothing is off-limits. From rootsy acoustic material with jazz elements to harder alternative rock to more experimental, ambient, and score music, Mystics Anonymous has been defined by its fierce independence and adventurous eclecticism.</p>
<p>Well, it's been almost ten years since the last Mystics Anonymous album. While I've been playing in a number of bands, my own songs have been piling up at an alarming rate. With the support and encouragement of friends and peers, I finally began work on the next Mystics Anonymous album, titled Dreaming for Hours, and I've elicited a talented group of performers to help realize my dream.</p>
<p>As the project is getting closer to completion this summer, it's sounding SO great and it's becoming clear that it deserves a professional mixing &amp; mastering job, as well as a nicely executed package with great artwork and a booklet containing art, lyrics, and liner notes. I would LOVE to make this happen, but I can't do it without YOUR help! By pre-ordering the album in one of several package deals ranging from $10 to $750, you can help make Dreaming for Hours LOOK and SOUND great.</p>
<p>If you help fund Dreaming for Hours, I can promise a professional and extensive mixing job, conducted in collaboration with Mark Alan Miller of Sonelab, as well as a professional mastering job (also done at Sonelab)!</p>
<p>I can also promise a great-looking package designed by artist Herta Silva. Herta and I are working closely together to design a real piece of visual art--a true album package you will want to hold in your hands, look through, and peruse. You can see a sneak preview of the album cover above. In addition to showcasing Herta's work, the package will also include printed lyrics and extensive liner notes detailing the large group of talented contributors on this album from a wide variety of great indie bands.</p>
To do all of this, I'm hoping to raise $2000 to match the $2000 I have already saved to put toward finishing the project. After paying Indiegogo, the money raised through this campaign will go toward mixing (about $1,000), mastering (about $250), and package production (about $600). There are many other costs associated with creating an album, but much of this I have already paid for or saved up for. What I need from YOU is help making it SOUND and LOOK as good as it possibly can! Raising the the entire $2000 will ensure I have enough to make this album sound as good for you as it does in my head!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you contribute to this campaign, this album WILL happen! Currently, my timeline is to finish recording by the end of August, mix and master in September, while also finishing up the package design. Then the album will be printed in October and I'm hoping for a November release! If you know me, or my work, you know that I am a responsible, disciplined, and dedicated performer and artist. Every penny you put in goes DIRECTLY toward making this album SOUND and LOOK great!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It doesn't take much to help, you can help fund the project at whatever level you're comfortable with, and every little bit counts! But the more you fund, the more you get, and the closer I come to reaching my goal!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you absolutely cannot part with any money at this time, then you can STILL help by getting the word out--tell your friends! Tell your family! Anyone who loves independent music and wants to be a part of a great campaign. Indiegogo makes it easy to share campaigns with others!</div>
<p>Thanks so much! I really appreciate you reading this and considering helping me realize this piece of work. With any luck, it will have us all Dreaming for Hours...</p>

<h3>Candy Brain Indiegogo Campaign</h3>
<p>We are Candy Brain, and Industrial Rock band from New York. Since we formed in 2011, we have been working our way through the local scene. Since then we have released an EP, titled Checkerboard Master, and opened for various major acts such as Orgy, Davey Suicide, and BILE. <br/><br/><br/>We have made many fans, and generated amazing support in this short time. Because of our support in a recent, we have made it onto the lineup of Triton Festival in New York City, one of the biggest festivals in Industrial and Goth music. For that, we give our deepest gratitude However, to get passed our next hurdle, we are going to need everyone's support. We plan on releasing our debut album, and a music video for our brand new single, Carnage Society, by the end of this year. <br/><br/>This album and music video release can push us to much greater heights, and if we pull if off, can look on towards touring shortly after. <br/><br/>This time, we are offering some nice perks for your contributions. (see below)  </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">$6000 Campaign</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>While we have poured tousands into this band before, this time, we are going to need your help for the magnitude of this project. In order to reach a professional level of quality, we are going to have to hire recording engineers, producers, photographers, and graphics designers. A heavy cost also goes into the packaging of the album. However, an equally, if not higher cost will go into the making of the Carnage Society music video. A director and crew must be hired, along with an overall budget on props, studio rental, and various other expenses. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the past two years, Candy Brain has really found their audience in New York, and a few other close cities. However, we are still missing that one thing that will change us from a small local act, to an internationally known touring act. This album and music video are what we need. But most importantly, our fans are who we need the most. You have all pulled through for us before, and this time we have something much bigger, and much greater to deliver. Together we can make this a success. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</div></div>","Hey! What're you kids trying to do?
This is what you would call a shot-gun fundraiser. Help support Field Tripp on our musical journey through AZ, NM and finally Austin, TX, where we will end up at the South by Southwest Music Festival. We're just a bunch of honest kids with okay souls working 9-5's just like you.. only we're taking off work for this.
 
Why should you give us your hard earned money?
We need to get paid somehow & gas ain't cheap. Plus we've got a bunch of cool stuff to give away with every donation made. Your money will help us pay for food, lodging, gas, production & a good time. If not we will simultaneously jump into the Grand Canyon, because that will be as far as we get without your generous donations.

<p>The Unending Thread is an independent rock band from San Fernando Valley, California. Started in the winter of 2011, The Unending Thread developed a unique sound characterized by complex rhythms and jazz textures in a post-rock context.</p>
<p>It has come to a point where The Unending Thread is ready to go out of the valley and share their music across the state where they hope they will be as well received as they have been at home. It doesn't stop there.</p>
<p>We have consistently put out material for our fans and this is a precedent we intend to continue to uphold. After all, for all the support our fans and friends have given us, it's the least we could do for them.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Some people in the industry refer to him as the <em>Biggest Lil Rapper Alive</em>, but those who know him, know that there's nothing little about his sound or his incredibly wild live shows.  After opening up for members of the Wu-Tang clan and just recently headlining his own show at Fortune Sound Club in Vancouver, Evan ""E Buddah"" Elman has set his sights on bringing his high energy and potent lyrics south of the Canadian border as part of a west coast tour.</p>

<p>Travelling down the coast with writer/artist/musician/athlete Frank Mayonnaise, the duo will perform every single night, including multiple open mic sessions when they do not have shows scheduled.  Mayo will be performing under his thrash-pop alias, <em>FisherMayne.</em> The “vehicle” seen above, will serve very literally as a combined art piece/home for the duration of the tour.  We are hoping to acquire a few sponsors and are extremely open to the idea of redecorating and branding our van/house.</p>

Lyra is a band from Toronto Ontario. They formed in the summer of 2010. It was love at first sight (or rather first sound) After a couple months of getting familiar Lyra began gigging frequently in and around the Toronto area, bringing their bundle of psychedelic space joy to the people.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>Eventually Lyra won the money to record their first EP in the summer of 2011. <strong>LISTEN HERE:</strong> (<a href=""http://lyrasounds.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://lyrasounds.com/</a>) Now in the summer of 2012 they are attempting to record another EP, one as flamboyant and succulent as Micheal Fassbender's dreamy eyes.</p>
<div> </div>
<div>After recording bass and drums however they have run out of money. And Like any dead broke weasel they are now mooching from the public. You might be asking, why help weasels? The answer is simple. Weasels make damn fine tunes.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3><strong>NEEDS</strong></h3>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>Our goal is $1500. That's a lot of money, we know. What we also know is that it takes a lot of money to make a record these days and a lot of hard working people need to get paid, that often go unnoticed in the world of music. They do things like this:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>$400 Mixing: So we've recorded the instruments, but all we can hear is the bass drum and piccolo flute. That's where mixing comes in</div>
<div> </div>
<div>$400 Mastering: The song is mixed now, but when I listen to it on my ipod I can't hear anything. It's mastering's time to shine</div>
<div> </div>
<div>$150 Artwork: Other artists need money too. The only way artists make money is through fellow artists</div>
<div> </div>
<div>$400 Production and Duplication: The record can't exist in the real world without this one</div>
<div> </div>
<div>$150 Copyrights: This is so in a few months you won't be hearing a new Nickelback song and be saying ""that sounds strangely familiar""</div>
<div> </div>
<h3><strong>THE RECORD</strong></h3>
<p>Afternoon Spores is a 4 song E.P. about how weasels steal money from unsuspecting, generous people. No. Well actually it's a record about comforts and how comforts can turn into dangerous things. You'll be clouded in blankets of texture and charming melodies, which grow into thunderstorms of driving rhythms and twisted effects. Sounds yummy right?</p>
<h3>I STILL DON'T CARE</h3>
<p>For those who don't know, Lyra's about caring &lt;3 And since life has forced us to be geographically separated in the year to come, this record will act as the glue to keep us alive. You may be asking: ""why fund a band who's not going to be plaing live or seeing each other for a year anyway?"" The answer to this is simple too. Once this record is made it will give us all more incentive to pick up where we left off, having the best time of our lives making music together. Also, you get prizes.</p>
<h3>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</h3>
<p>If you're like us and don't have money to give you can still help greatly by sharing this page with friends, family members, facebook and anyone else you think would be interested in hearing some new tunes from Toronto's greatest space pop quartet. Thanks so much for reading. Infinite love goes out to you</p></div>","OUR STORY

<h3>New updates!</h3>
<p>-A Hardcover autobiography book, 'The Road Up North' will be released in conjunction with the album campaign. Get the limited edition hard cover book (only 100 copies) when you fund the campaign with the Keepsake Pack or All Merchandise Pack. Comes with CD album and cool perks!</p>
<h3>Tell me your story</h3>
<p>So I'm making my first full length album! Had no idea but I was furiously writing while touring my first EP - Truth is, I never stopped writing even though I was on the road. My phone recorder became my demo scratchpad capturing nuances, ideas, chorus lines and sparks that came to my head (in transit, in the green room, in the middle of a conversation, in the toilet!).</p>
<p>I've spent all of autumn and winter this year hiding away, piecing together the jigsaw puzzle of these soundbites with the help of Kevin Foo and Irving Koh at Beep Studios from Singapore. These are long time friends who started out as indie bands back when we were younger.</p>
<p>I can't wait for you to hear the full spectrum of the emotions, triumphs, stories, anecdotes, ironies that make up this new album. ""Maybe Somewhere North"" might just represent a surprising departure from my blues-pop influence of John Mayer, Jack Johnson, Jason Mraz. Just saying.</p>
<p>I invite you to jump on board this new boat I am sailing on and go up north with me before it gets crowded with everyone else. I am so excited and cannot wait to share it with you.</p>
<p>Your support and pre-orders will be crucial to put the wind beneath my sails. I can't wait to see you on the road!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get (Bundles &amp; Perks)</h3>
<p>We need to raise about $10,000 or more to help defray the costs of production, touring, making music videos, publicity, marketing, merchandising - the food chain surrounding an artist release - the people who work in the background to design, direct, publicize, manage and support everything from artwork design to sound recording to touring. I want to be able to feed and take care of those who directly help me get the music out there. Good professional work comes at a cost.</p>
<p>I have already put most of what I made and saved over the last two years towards the production of the album. The amount raised here will go towards the following...</p>
<p>- manufacturing of CDs and merchandise,</p>
<p>- designers, photographers, publicists,</p>
<p>- shooting music videos (yes, we wanna do more than just one!)</p>
<p>- touring costs for the release</p>
<p>- production of album, recording, mixing, mastering (if we raise enough, we might even master it at Abbey Road Studios!! Home of The Beatles!!)</p>
<p>What you will get</p>
<p>- Depending on the contribution bundle you pre-order, you will get a variety of things such as <strong>Digital Download</strong> of the entire album (mp3s), <strong>CD album</strong>, <strong>Posters</strong>, limited edition <strong>Merchandise</strong>, <strong>Tickets</strong> to the shows, before anyone else gets their hands on it.</p>
<p>- <strong>Super and Mega Fan Packages</strong> will give you such exclusives like <strong>hang outs</strong> with the band at the show (Singapore, Malaysia or Melbourne), <strong>afterparty</strong>, an <strong>exclusive house concert</strong>, more merchandise!</p>
<p>- You can start as little as $10 contribution. Every little bit helps!</p>
<p>- Or if you like, you can make a no obligation contribution of any amount of your choice if you prefer to give without getting anything in return. Click on 'Contribute Now' underneath funding target on the right above.</p>
<p>- I will thank you personally on my facebook page by name! (Let me know if you prefer to be anonymous)</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact Of Numbers</h3>
<p>The entirety of an independent project release involves every aspect from ground up - recording, production, mastering, touring, design, press, publicity and marketing is around $40,000 - $50,000 as a conservative shoestring budget. My personal pledge towards kickstarting this project is $10,000. The additional amount raised will directly impact paying for a team to work with me on the tour, CD design, posters, merchandise and all that mentioned above. Most importantly I want to bring my awesome band with me on tour! =)</p>
<p>$5000 raised on this campaign will help us get the basics of the release in place. $10,000 or more will help us bring the album mastering to Abbey Road and place the album on the commercial map and do a whole lot more.</p>
<p>It will of course bring the band on tour. Every additional person adds flights, transport, accomodation, living expenses, visas, permit fees when we go to a different city to tour.</p>
<p>We hope to be able to go back to most, if not, all the cities I have performed in 2011. Predominantly, the asian and australian cities. We are planning a South East Asian tour together with a national Australian tour. All this depends on how much budget we can raise.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are so many ways you can help other than contributing financially. Here are some suggestions,</p>
<p>- Tell your friends about the campaign,</p>
<p>- Use the share button and spread it on social media,</p>
<p>- Share the video,</p>
<p>- Like this campaign.</p>
<p>- Bring us to your city by starting a word of mouth campaign. A budget of around AUD$5000 will be enough to cover flights and expenses to bring the band into your city and perform a concert for up to a few hundred people. Send us an email to wenona@soulmannalive.com if you like to explore such a possibility.</p>

<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>We are AMP and for the past 3 years, we have strived to create music that glorifies God and encourages the Body of Christ.  </p>
<p>This campaign will enable us to produce more content, fulfilling what we believe God has called us to.  Your support will help us to serve you and others with music &amp; media, and continue to reach a generation who needs to hear the Gospel.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $30,000 through this campaign. This will allow us to invest in resources that will help us to produce more music, videos, and overall content.  We are hoping to release at least 4 projects in 2013 consisting of another AMP album and solo albums from Sam Ock, J.Han, and CL and releasing more consistant video content.</p>
<p>We are offering cool perks for different giving levels, which you can check out on the side, including free CD's &amp; T-Shirts, to an exclusive song written just for you, and even spending a day in the studio with us!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign is important to us because it will fuel what we believe is the good work that God has prepared in advance for us to do (Eph 2:10). We've been so encouraged by messages, comments, emails, etc. of how AMP's music has been blessing people, strengthening them during hard times, even leading some back to Christ; we desire to continue to be an encouragement to the Church and a beacon to the lost.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<p>Other ways to support us are to help promote this campaign, sharing it with your friends on your veious social media outlets, and more than that, we ask for your spiritual support in prayer!</p>

We are offering cool perks for different giving levels, which you can check out on the side, including free CD's & T-Shirts, to an exclusive song written just for you, and even spending a day in the studio with us!


The Impact
This campaign is important to us because it will fuel what we believe is the good work that God has prepared in advance for us to do (Eph 2:10). We've been so encouraged by messages, comments, emails, etc. of how AMP's music has been blessing people, strengthening them during hard times, even leading some back to Christ; we desire to continue to be an encouragement to the Church and a beacon to the lost.


Other Ways You Can Help

Other ways to support us are to help promote this campaign, sharing it with your friends on your veious social media outlets, and more than that, we ask for your spiritual support in prayer!
Thank you for taking your time and we hope that you would find it in your heart to continually support us in our endeavors to fulfill our calling to encourage all of God's people!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About the Campaign</h3>
<p>     My name is Brooke Murray. I am a former member and the current choreographer for the Sterling Silvertones Show Choir. I have been choreographing for the Silvertones since 2007, when I graduated from the high school and completed my fourth year as a member of the group. <br/>      This campaign is important, not only to me but to the 40+ students who have worked tirelessly and enthusiastically to create a show that is complex and entertaining. To family, friends, co-workers and anyone who likes to support the arts in small-town communities, please donate to send this group to New York, because they REALLY deserve it. <br/><br/>      WHY THEY DESERVE IT: <br/><br/>     In past years the group was great, but this year is different. When we began the process to create this year’s show, instead of learning choreography we started with a discussion. We discussed the qualities of the movement and themes of the songs, but most importantly about how the bar of expectations for the group will be raised. The choral director and I challenged the students to think outside of the box in terms of choreography, but we also challenged them to behave more professionally as individuals and as a unified group. <br/>      Within a week we saw a noticeable change in the attitude of the group. Upperclassmen and new members collaborated to take on the challenges. I was baffled to discover the passion that these students had about performing. I was also surprised to learn that so many of the students had such high levels of dedication and leadership potential. <br/>      We began creating this year’s show without any intention to go to competition. The group has tried to go away on trips to compete in previous years, but due to economic troubles the trips were cancelled because too many students were unable to cover the costs of the trips. <br/><br/>      SO, WHY SHOULD YOU DONATE TO THIS CAMPAIGN?<br/><br/>      You should donate because the students of this group have gone above and beyond all expectations. These students have grown as individuals and as a TEAM since the first day of working on the show.  <br/>       Your contributions will help to send this well-deserving group of students on what could be a trip of a lifetime. When I was in the group we went away on competitions every year. We were fortunate enough to be able to afford the cost of the bus, meals, hotel rooms and other expenses. Looking back though, each trip was worth every penny for the memories that were created.<br/>       These students DESERVE the chance to compete against other show choirs, to see the caliber of performance of other groups their age, and to create amazing memories. The cost for each student is about $500. Five hundred extra dollars is not easy to come by for most families from our area, especially for families of Seniors with expenses for testing, college applications and the traditional senior trip. These students should NOT have to miss out on this wonderful opportunity! Our goal amount to be raised is $5,000. It sounds hefty, but if we reach our goal we will be able to defray the cost per student by about $100. So PLEASE CONTRIBUTE so that EACH member can afford this opportunity! Your contributions will prove to them that WITH HARD WORK COMES GREAT REWARD!! </p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>We are Big City Supreme, a 100% independent rock and roll band hailing from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and we make fun rockin' music for the people to get down to. </p>
<p>There comes a time in every bands life when they must hit the studio in order to progress their musical career.  That time is now for Big City Supreme.  As many of you know we have been rocking for a couple years now, taking pride in putting on a full out, fun, energetic live rock show.  We put out a three song sampler EP in late 2011 with the promise of an upcoming album but unfortunately that album has been delayed multiple times until now.  Finally we are hitting the studio in July to finish our first full length album and we need your help!</p>
<p>We have enjoyed local success and gained many friends and fans and thats why this album is so important to us.  We want to give the fans more music and want to show the world what we can do.  It is time to take this band to the next level and we truly believe having a full length album will open many doors for us.  Your contribution and support will be eternally appreciated and never forgotten. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Recording an album is not cheap.  Not only does it take hours, days, months, and years of practicing and writing but there are many facets involved with the recording process.  We are hoping to raise $5000 to help cover the costs of recording, artwork, and CD pressing.  Here are some of the costs we will incur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio time = $75/hour x 24 hours = $1800</li>
<li>Mixing = $75/hour x 35 hours = $2625</li>
<li>Mastering = $75/hour x 9 hours = $675</li>
<li>Album Artwork = $1000</li>
<li>Pressing = $2000</li>
<li>Rehearsal Space = $450/month</li>
<li>Band Member Salary = $0</li>
</ul><p>Running total = $8550+</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now don't think we would ask for support and not give you something in return!  Along with the satisfaction of knowing you helped us create this album we have set up some awesome perks for all contributors!  Check them out below to see what you can get.</p>

Her songs range from changing the world, to equal rights, to taking chances, to clever, witty pop songs about past relationships. Right when she walks on stage with her bubbly personality, you know you are in for a good time. Although you wouldn't think it by looking at her, she has one of the most powerful, unique voices out there, which is sure to take many people pleasantly by surprise.She has a go-getting mind set, and she isn't slowing down anytime soon, or ever, which is evident in lyrics you find in her song ""Rising up:""""I climb a tree, you cut down the branchesI go to build a fire, you burn out the matchesWhen will you learn I'm never slowing downI fly to the moon, you rediscover MarsYou need your friends, all I need is my guitar..""
Mary and Brie would love to go on tour to better connect with people and make new friends and fans by sharing their music with different audiences around the US! It would be such an amazing accomplishment for both Mary and Brie to be able to start living their dream, but we need your help to do so! Even $1 can make a difference!


What We Need & What You Get
Here's where you come in. We will need your help to raise enough money to be able to go on this tour. All the money we raise will go towards gas, food, shelter and other expenses we may need to cover while on the road.
By helping fund our goal, you will recieve different packages of things Mary and Brie will make available to you such as exclusive MP3 tracks of previously unreleased songs, signed photos, shout outs, personal phone calls from Mary and Brie, tickets to a show near you, even a private intimate acoustic show!


The Impact
As stated earlier, even $1 can make a difference. Brie and Mary have dedicated their lives to music and performing, and you would be helping make dreams come true! What's more satisfying than that? 
Every donation counts, no matter how small. Mary and Brie would be so appreciative and happy to do this tour.

<p><span>The concert date is set for January 23, 2013, at the Culver Center for the Arts in Riverside, CA!  As many of you may already know, an artistic collaboration is scheduled between choreographers, Monica Rodero and Dan Schuchart, and the acclaimed contemporary classical music ensemble, Victoire.   All the wheels have been set in motion, but we could use your help in balancing our budget for<em><strong> Cathedral City</strong>,</em> an evening of music and dance.  Please consider giving a contribution to support the travel of independent art-making from coast to coast.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>VICTOIRE</strong> is a family of musical misfits living in New York City, helmed by composer/keyboardist Missy Mazzoli.  This “all-star, all-female band” (Time Out New York) of strings, keyboards, clarinets, and electronics performs Mazzoli’s hypnotic blend of dreamy chamber pop, minimalism, and rich romanticism.  Their debut album <em>Cathedral City</em>, released in 2010 on New Amsterdam Records, envelopes the listener in a tapestry of classical influences, distorted guitars, multi-layered vocals, vintage keyboard sounds and stuttering samples.

<p><span>We, </span><span><strong>Monica Rodero </strong>and<strong> Dan Schuchart</strong>, met while pursuing B.F.A. degrees in Dance from UW-Milwaukee and are now both pursuing M.F.A. degrees in Experimental Choreography at the University of California, Riverside.

<p>1. The work we do all comes back to activism and
empowerment; our mission has always had the heart of a non-profit.</p>
<p>2. Ownership of Wild Iris belongs to the community. We’d like to invite more of the community
into the process of creating the future. Changing our structure to a non-profit will create a board so we can truly involve community members to help take us to the next level.<br/></p>
<p>3. For more than 5 years, we've been an all volunteer run organization. Our owners and staff have not received
compensation for their work and time.  By
changing to a non-profit, we can pursue grants and donations for salary,
intern scholarships, and volunteer recognition.</p>
<p>4. Over the years, the store has accumulated significant debt to continue operations.  The financial burden of this debt hinders us from really getting out there and doing the important work.<br/></p>
<p>5. We get it - you probably don't really need a $35 hardcover book - and we also love our libraries and Kobo eReaders.  But if you believe that our feminist mission is worth it and you know firsthand or from others how Wild Iris Books can help transform lives, now you can support us with your donation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Yes! Yes! Yes! We Will Still Sell Books and Speak Out:</strong></p>
<p>We will continue to sell books, journals, cards, and other feminist treasures - don't worry 
about that!  Our legal switch is strategic and we will retain our ability to 
speak out against politicians and policies that serve to oppress women and
 other marginalized populations.<br/></p>
<strong>Just How Much Does it Take to Keep the Iris Going?</strong>
<p>Our monthly expenses run just over $1,500 - and again this is just operational costs with no compensation for workers.  Imagine trying to sell over $4,000 worth of <i>books </i>a month to stay in the black.  It won't work and our doors will soon close if we continue this route.  <br/></p>
<p>Your contribution will make it possible to refocus on our feminist work.  It will give us some breathing room to create a strategic plan for debt reduction so that the space can continue to flourish unhindered by this weight.<br/></p>
<p>Your donation will go straight to the core of keeping operations going and help give us the freedom of knowing expenses are covered so that our mental, physical, emotional, and financial energy can focus on the grassroots work we want to do.<br/></p>

Your contribution will make it possible to refocus on our feminist work.  It will give us some breathing room to create a strategic plan for debt reduction so that the space can continue to flourish unhindered by this weight.
Your donation will go straight to the core of keeping operations going and help give us the freedom of knowing expenses are covered so that our mental, physical, emotional, and financial energy can focus on the grassroots work we want to do.
Why Your Local Feminist Bookstore(s) Matters:
Just take a look at some of the recent things we’ve been a part of and don't forget our gallery for a random assortment of Iris pics over the years….

Partnered with Alachua County Victim Services
for the Survivors Art Exhibit, which showcased local art from survivors of sexual assault, while fostering a safe space for the artists to gather privately
Annual ""Poster for Tomorrow"" gallery show, past shows have included international art focused on Gender Inequality and Homelessness
Wild Iris Feminist Open Mic, Feminist Book Club &
Feminist Meditation Group
Partnered with Books for Prisoners to fulfill
inmate book requests from women
Helped Launch Trans Affairs at Wild Iris – working to provide
clothing, referrals, general support, and other trans* resources
Sinister Wisdom Release Party – Issue 93 –
Southern Lesbian-Feminist History
Red Tent Event with Dr. Isadora Liedenfrost,which included the communal construction of a red tent, a documentary screening of previous gatherings and a celebration of the feminine divine
Annual Living History Event: a night of queer
storytelling with UF Multicultural & Diversity Affairs
Provided scholarships to NWL Feminism 101 Summer
Workshop Series
In-store Advocacy Center – letters, phone
scripts and phones focused on activist causes
Co-Hosting Hobby Lobby CR Group & Protest Sign Making Party
Co-sponsored Roe v. Wade events with NWL and NOW
Feminist music, poets, authors, kids story time
and more...

We need your help to jumpstart the switch.  Think about the intern who is already struggling to scrape up textbook money, the travel costs for a trans activist to come speak, a donation of a feminist book - maybe the first feminist book of someone's life, a small salary for someone willing to hold down the fort, scholarships to classes that bring feminist history to life, the supplies to make your first (or hundredth) protest sign......  
With Your Help - The Possibilities are Endless.....

<p>My name is Joey Clarkson and I am a singer/songwriter from the Comox Valley.</p>
<p>Last March I was fortunate to be asked to do an interview/live performance slot on BBC Introducing in Norfolk. I have been invited back to do another interview on BBC Introducing this summer, and to take them up on this opportunity I have decided to do another mini tour of the UK, this time accompanied by my best friend and backing vocalist Breanne Larson.</p>
<p>So, in typical Joey and Bee fashion: we are heading to the UK for two weeks this August, to promote my new single “Save Yourself” (June, 2012) and my up and coming single “Boy I think I love you” (August, 2012). We have several shows organized, in some very unique venues! We will be playing pretty much everywhere: Pubs, House Parties, In the BBC Studio in Norfolk, in an old theatre, and as always: you can expect to see some good old fashioned busking!</p>
<p>The most exciting part of this project is that Chad Weber of VI Multimedia is going to be following our adventure and capturing it on film! The idea being: to use the footage captured to create 5-7 web episodes of an inside look at an independent artists (attempted) rise to success. At the end of the tour, these “blogisodes” will be compiled to create a documentary style film! </p>
<p>The tour will take place between August 5 – 18’th, and we are beyond looking forward to being able to share it with all of our fans, friends and family back home, and around the world!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We have set a goal of raising $3000 to help fund this tour/web series adventure; essentially we are hoping to raise enough money to cover airfare for the 3 of us from Vancouver to the UK. In reality, this isn’t even close to covering the costs associated with an international tour, but we are lucky, and have family and friends in the UK that will be hosting us on couches, floors and in tents while we are there to help cut back on costs!</p>
<p>If we exceed our goal, the funds will go towards covering other aspects of the tour, such as: Printing of CD’s, Car Rental, Petrol to and from gigs, ect.  If we don’t reach our goal, the funds will still go towards our goal!</p>

My name is Joey Clarkson and I am a singer/songwriter from the Comox Valley.
Last March I was fortunate to be asked to do an interview/live performance slot on BBC Introducing in Norfolk. I have been invited back to do another interview on BBC Introducing this summer, and to take them up on this opportunity I have decided to do another mini tour of the UK, this time accompanied by my best friend and backing vocalist Breanne Larson.
So, in typical Joey and Bee fashion: we are heading to the UK for two weeks this August, to promote my new single “Save Yourself” (June, 2012) and my up and coming single “Boy I think I love you” (August, 2012). We have several shows organized, in some very unique venues! We will be playing pretty much everywhere: Pubs, House Parties, In the BBC Studio in Norfolk, in an old theatre, and as always: you can expect to see some good old fashioned busking!
The most exciting part of this project is that Chad Weber of VI Multimedia is going to be following our adventure and capturing it on film! The idea being: to use the footage captured to create 5-7 web episodes of an inside look at an independent artists (attempted) rise to success. At the end of the tour, these “blogisodes” will be compiled to create a documentary style film! 
The tour will take place between August 5 – 18’th, and we are beyond looking forward to being able to share it with all of our fans, friends and family back home, and around the world!
What We Need & What You Get
We have set a goal of raising $3000 to help fund this tour/web series adventure; essentially we are hoping to raise enough money to cover airfare for the 3 of us from Vancouver to the UK. In reality, this isn’t even close to covering the costs associated with an international tour, but we are lucky, and have family and friends in the UK that will be hosting us on couches, floors and in tents while we are there to help cut back on costs!
If we exceed our goal, the funds will go towards covering other aspects of the tour, such as: Printing of CD’s, Car Rental, Petrol to and from gigs, ect.  If we don’t reach our goal, the funds will still go towards our goal!
 
The Impact
This project will be full of tips that will help other independent artists with organizing an international tour to promote their music! We have a tendency to make lots of mistakes, and have absolutely no shame when it comes to sharing them; so, if they can’t learn from how we do things, they can definitely learn from how we don’t!
In the very least, this project is sure to put a smile on your face... and will definitely keep a our Moms happy!

<h4>Leah Morise - preorder campaign for album #2<br/>
</h4>Thanks for taking the time to drop by and see how things are going with my newest album. I released my first album in 2006 and figured that I am certainly overdue for the second one. If you know me, you know that I have been justifiably busy for the last few years with having bought this house, renovating and starting a house concert series. I have put my music on the back burner and it is time to focus and take advantage of this lovely space to record my next album. By opening up the opportunity for a <b>presale</b>, I can help pay for the musicians, recording and production in advance and be able to deliver a finished project this summer.<br/><br/><h4>This is what the money will be spent on:<br/>
</h4>Recording - I have hired a recording engineer (Adam Plante) who will come into the space with his gear and set it all up to make us sound great. We will listen and mix and get the album mastered so it is ready to be pressed.<br/><br/>Performers - There are some talented people who will be joining me by playing or singing on this 
project. Paying them fairly for their performance is important to me!<br/><br/>Production - The cost of producing the physical CDs. Over one third of the cost will go towards manufacturing the CD, case and insert.<br/><br/>I have been saving so I will be able to put some money towards the recording plus promote the CD and fund an east 
coast Canadian tour in August. Even if I cannot reach the goal, every bit helps. I am on a mission and when I put my mind to something...  ;-)<br/><br/>Please take a few minutes to check out the <b>perks</b> I am offering. <b>For $20 you can order a signed CD to be mailed to you before it is released to the public.</b> All perks will contain a early release digital copy
 of the album. There are even some special or
unusual one-of-a-kind goods/services being offered. Come back and visit the page for more behind-the-scenes information.<br/><br/>I can't thank you enough for your pledge and your support! I have received so much interest in my music and look forward to sharing more of my songs with the world. Even if you cannot personally afford to contribute, you can help by sharing with 
friends who might be interested in my music and this project.<br/>

<p><b>Something Involving A Monkey <br/>""Dive Into the Great Blue Waffle""</b></p>
<p>Something
Involving A Monkey is an avant-garde, multi-genre band from Cleveland, OH, that
formed in 2010 by guitarist/keyboardist Joe Petrich, drummer Todd Ankrom and bassist/kazooist
BeZo. After the tragic loss of Todd Ankrom in 2011, Nick Ritz began carrying the
drumming duties later in 2012. The group has issued one release under their
name, and has played all over Ohio, Western PA, Indiana, Kentucky, and
Michigan, with the likes of Polkadot Cadaver, Psychostick, Downtown Brown,
Green Jelly and many others. They've opened for Stolen Babies, Between the
Buried &amp; Me, Bam Margera, Dog Fashion Disco, and have piqued the interest
of many wherever they perform. They are now ready to enter the studio for their
2nd full length album and are looking for the help of their fans, friends… and
even foes… in helping fund this record.</p>
<p><b>THE GOAL<br/></b><span>The
$3,500 goal is small in comparison to the cost of most album recordings. But SIAM
has been diligently writing this album for the last 18 months and we are ready
to go!! Studio time has been arranged. We are hoping this will cover expenses
to not only record, but also handle CD duplication and basic promotion of the
album. For being a small regional independent act, pre-funding is an essential
part of making this album. </span></p>
<p><b>THE PERKS</b><br/>
As you peruse the perks, you will notice that creativity and humor not only
encompass SIAM's music, but also in these perks. We have a plethora of monetary
options with some basic to very unique perks. Almost all the perks come with a
copy of our 2nd studio release, ""Dive Into the Great Blue Waffle"",
with your name listed in the credits. Bonuses increase as you go up. From
simple shirt &amp; CD packages to eating BeZo's homemade blue waffle recipe to
ditties written about <b>YOU</b> to
personal live performances to music videos with <b>YOU</b> AS THE STAR! We guarantee that there is something you will want
to try! Please note that NO DENOMINATION IS TOO SMALL. It takes a community of
support for an album to be released these days, so whatever you are willing to
contribute will be GREATLY appreciated by the band.</p>
<p><b>THE ALBUM</b><br/>
Something Involving A Monkey is excited to release this album. Our previous
album, ""The Wasteland"", came about after the tragic loss of our former
drummer. That album was also pre-funded &amp; released by the band
independently. It has sold over 500 copies, which, in this day and age, for a
local/regional, unsigned act, is not too shabby. ""Dive Into the Great Blue
Waffle"" is set to be a more energetic, upbeat, and heavier album. Most bands
start to hit their stride on their sophomore release, and this couldn't be any
more true for SIAM! On top of the 9 main tracks set to be recorded, we have another
half dozen tracks of ditties, called ""quips"", which we will weave
through this album. Something Involving A Monkey has proven, and continues to
prove, that the music we create is not only original, but maintains a
presentation unlike anything you've heard before.</p>
<p>It
is always asked, “what risks and challenges might come with recording an album?”
And to be honest, there isn't much we as musicians in this band haven't faced.
All three of us have been long time contributors to the Cleveland/Northeast
Ohio music scene. And we have already proven, during ""The Wasteland""
recording, that adversity does not prevent us from executing a solid, creative album.<br/><br/>
Please consider pledging to this endeavor and help us achieve a new personal
milestone. We thank you for your support over the years and into the future!!</p>

<h3>Be in Our Next Music Video</h3>
<p>Do you want to be in Billy Kay's next music video - <em>When You Hold Me Tight</em>?
 Well now you can! I've actually always made special editions of my 
videos and my Picture CDs for my friends and associates. And I'm always 
told I should do the same for my fans. So now it's my fans' time to 
shine!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We've all felt the feeling! You're in an embrace... the feeling overwhelms you... and you instinctively pull your partner tighter! Everyone has a picture of a hug! Maybe from your wedding. A camping trip. Hec - even in your kitchen - if that's when the mood struck you! It would be so cool to have a bunch of REAL pictures of REAL folks holding each other float across the screen in the music video!<br/><br/>

We're in the recording studio now cutting the track. You can hear it's 
progress as we add instruments and vocals by clicking the music video above.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>When You Hold Me Tight</strong> is scheduled for a March
 release. It's a hot track about a universal human emotion with a memorable groove that's destined to 
become Billy's breakout signature song. Now you can be a part of it!<br/><br/>

We're funding this project through fan donations and corporate 
sponsorships and - like all my previous songs - will ultimately have the
 song attached to a charity, so a percentage of the profits from the 
song's downloads benefit that charity. I'm implementing the newest 
method of releasing music that incorporates giving - both musically and 
fiscally.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The video production company we're using is THE hottest studio in town! They make the commercials for all the hot clubs. They start at $2000 - which is basically the equivalent of filming a band in their garage. Do we want pretty girls in the video? Duh! A song about hugs BETTER have pretty girls! Add $1000. Will there be location shots with additional filming permits? With additional days? That's another $1000 per.<br/><br/>

So get on board! Make history! Your sponsorship ($5 to whatever dollars)
 in exchange for some awesome Billy Kay mementos - like free mp3s, credits
 in the video, or singing backup vocals. Hec! I'll even ""Hold you tight""
 in the video! Just click the big Sponsor button.</p>

<p><strong>Bookish</strong> was written and recorded last winter -- my first winter living on the coast of Maine. It was bitterly cold outside and there was ice and blowing snow, and I hibernated upstairs in my writing alcove and downstairs in Peter’s Gallway Bay studio to work on this record – solo, live-in-the-studio, unguarded, focused. Peter mixed the recording, beautifully, with great skill and great ears. It will be mastered in Portland, Maine, by Michael McInnis, and manufactured through Crooked Cove, in Kennebunk.</p>
<p>I’ve been unable to travel for several years because I have chronic Lyme Disease. It has turned my world upside down and made it very small. Touring and performing are out of the question. But I keep writing, constantly, and I’ve recorded these new songs to sound the way I would play them on stage if I were able to bring them to you in person.</p>
<p>I am fortunate to be able to record here at home in Peter’s studio, and to create the packaging design, websites, videos, photos and promotional materials upstairs in my office space.

<p>Now the recording is complete, the weather is spectacular, I’ve come out of hibernation and am asking for your help in getting this project mastered, manufactured, marketed, on the radio, and into your hands.

</div></div>","Bookish was written and recorded last winter -- my first winter living on the coast of Maine. It was bitterly cold outside and there was ice and blowing snow, and I hibernated upstairs in my writing alcove and downstairs in Peter’s Gallway Bay studio to work on this record – solo, live-in-the-studio, unguarded, focused. Peter mixed the recording, beautifully, with great skill and great ears. It will be mastered in Portland, Maine, by Michael McInnis, and manufactured through Crooked Cove, in Kennebunk.
I’ve been unable to travel for several years because I have chronic Lyme Disease. It has turned my world upside down and made it very small. Touring and performing are out of the question. But I keep writing, constantly, and I’ve recorded these new songs to sound the way I would play them on stage if I were able to bring them to you in person.

<h3>CIRCLE of LOVE</h3>
<p>My name is Pratibha, I was born in Copenhagen. Over many years I have been singing and playing music for dancing and meditations. In 2002 my first CD 'Heartdance' was born, followed my 'Here with You' and 'Echo of a Star'. I have been facilitating Heart Dances and Voice journeys in many different festivals and venues all over Europe for the last 20 years. It gives me immense joy to see everyone light up in a singing circle and in no time it truly becomes a circle of love. But a circle of love can also happen when you are on your own listening to music that touch your heart. It is my deepest wish that the songs may nourish the listener, be a kind of embrace in these, for many, troubled times. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>6.500 Euro for recording and producing the album</h3>
<p>Any amount will be gratefully received! The money will go to finance the recording and producing of the CD. It will also be available on the various digital outlets. I will be working with my friend, a professional, gifted musician and wizard David Springborg in Copenhagen. We will start the recordings as soon as the goal is reached :-)</p>
<p>There are a few so-called 'perks', which means special offers to the ones with greater contributions, like web based voice coaching, house concerts and heart dances at your own events....</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It gives me great joy to hear when people tell me how much they enjoy my music, have played it at special occasions both happy and sad or having daily sing alongs in the car. I believe music and singing is an immense healing factor in our lives. That's also why I have created the Voice Healing Journeys to help expand and open the connection to your own voice. For self expression, inner peace and creativity. If you like to get a taste of my music go to <a href=""http://www.pratibha.dk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.pratibha.dk</a> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Since I have worked with David Springborg before ('Echo of a Star') and I know his skills both as a gifted musician and a producer, I feel an excitement about entering on this new journey because we both have quite a bit of experience in creating albums. It will be my fourth one and I'm really exited to get started. We never seem to run out of inspiration. Can't wait to get started! :-)</p>
<p>there is always a risk in creating something new -but one worth taking </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have means to spare I would be very grateful if maybe you can help me share this page to all and everyone you know ....that would just be fantastic:-) </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! Welcome to my first ever solo album crowdfunding campaign! </p>
<p>Some of you will know me from my work with UK folk rock bands Oysterband, Levellers and John Jones and the Reluctant Ramblers - among others.</p>
<p>You may have seen me on tour in the UK earlier this year as chain maker, ‘Bird’ in Townsend Theatre Productions critically acclaimed folk opera ‘Rouse Ye Women’ (written by Neil Gore and John Kirkpatrick). You may have even found my music independently… To those of you who don’t know me at all … welcome, it’s great to have you here!</p>
<p>Song writing and making music has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. The songs I write express my feelings, thoughts and experiences of the world we live in - some shared and some solitary but all human. I find myself drawn to themes of nature in my writing. I also enjoy working with traditional songs and creating lush vocal arrangements. For example: <a href=""https://rowangodel.bandcamp.com/track/the-lark-in-the-morning"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://rowangodel.bandcamp.com/track/the-lark-...</a> </p>
<p>I'm often asked at gigs, when I will release a full length studio album. I've wanted to do this very much for a long time but the music industry has changed and record companies aren't investing in artists in the way they used to.</p>
<p>So what is an artist to do when they want to make work and put it out there but don’t have the financial backing of a record company? </p>
<p>These days, more and more artists are finding other ways to support their creative projects - including crowdfunding - and involving their biggest supporters … you, their audience! </p>
<p>I’m hugely excited to share this with you all and I hope you’ll enjoy walking alongside me as my project develops and grows into the album I want to make for me and for you. </p>
<p>I have some incredible musicians involved already, including multi instrumentalists Benji Kirkpatrick and Tim Cotterell, with the amazing Al Scott (Oysterband / Levellers) on production. </p>
<p>I feel very privileged to have the opportunity to work with such fantastically talented people. </p>
<p>All funds raised will be used to pay for musicians time and skill, studio time and production, CD art work and manufacturing and a proper PR campaign to support the albums release in March to help make it a success.</p>
<p>With your help, it's time to make it happen!!! You can choose your ""perk"" or if you just want to contribute, hit the ""Back It"" button and enter any amount you like!</p>
<p>Over the next weeks, I’ll be sharing exclusive news with you as the album progresses and I look forward to seeing you at a Rowan Godel Trio gig somewhere on my album release tour in March 2020. You can find my website here for dates! <a href=""https://rowangodel.co.uk/live-dates/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://rowangodel.co.uk/live-dates/</a></p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to check out my music. Your support is invaluable and very much appreciated! </p>

<h3>Jeremy Wilms' ""LARGE FORMAT"" Studio Recording and Master's Thesis</h3>
<p>My name is Jeremy Wilms. I've been a professional musician based in New York City for over 20 years. In that time I've had multitudinous and widely varied musical experiences. Here's a partial list of things I've been up to:</p>
<p>I've jammed with Ornette Coleman at his loft and played Broadway revues at retirement communities in New Jersey (sometimes in the same weekend). I was briefly in Chico Hamilton’s band playing guitar, and played bass on Broadway in Fela! the musical. During the tour for Fela! I played with Fela Kuti’s son Femi at the Shrine in Lagos and other venues around the world. I have recorded with artists as diverse as Bebel Gilberto and Beyoncé. I am currently a guitarist in the orchestra for MacArthur Fellowship winner Taylor Mac’s “24 Decade History of Popular Music” as well as the bassist on ABC Network’s “The Gong Show” with host Mike Meyers. I am also the arranger and musical director for The Heathens and other acts based at the fabled Mckittrick Hotel, home of “Sleep No More” in NYC.</p>
<p>I am launching this campaign to finish funding a ""large scale"" recording project I started this past spring. What was begun as a Master's thesis for the completion of my Composition Degree a<font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">t Queens College has now become a behemoth of musical diversity and exploration. In the process I have realized the importance of properly finishing the project and getting it released in a legit fashion.</span></font></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">So far the whole recording has been paid for by student loans and personal financing. I've now come to the point of needing contributors to get it properly finished, packaged, publicized, and released to the world. Your contribution will help this goal be achieved and birth what I feel to be my most important work to date.</span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal is to raise $8,000. This will cover most of the costs of recording, musician fees, mixing and mastering, publicist costs, and money for physical merchandise.</p>
<p>The recording is very broad and far reaching, therefore it has required using many musicians to complete. At current count there are over 30 musicians (!) on the record. As there is still one more song to be recorded, this number could go up to 40. The vast majority of the money raised will go towards musician fees. The contributors are an extremely diverse group culled from top players across scenes and genres I have traversed over my years in NYC.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is important to me, and I believe to the community, in many ways.</p>
<p>First of all, it provides an opportunity for wide scale, non-commercially based art music to be created and disseminated without any constrictions on the creator. I have made the music I heard in my head, with some help and guidance from mentors, but without a label or an entity that needed to change or decide things based on commerce. This is extremely important in the world where decisions on what we hear and consume are being made on almost entirely commercial factors. </p>
<p>Secondly it employs a large number of top musicians and brings people together from varied backgrounds, both socially and musically. It really is a boundary-less community I am involved in and it is important for me to create and share music made this way with the world.</p>
<p>I've produced and performed on many records at this point in my career. In addition to being a side person on a lot of records, I have 3 instrumental records and 2 singer songwriter records as a bandleader. All of these I've produced myself and have used my community to help in the process. </p>
<p>Making this record is currently the number one focus of my career and will be a very important milestone.</p>

My name is Jeremy Wilms. I've been a professional musician based in New York City for over 20 years. In that time I've had multitudinous and widely varied musical experiences. Here's a partial list of things I've been up to:
I've jammed with Ornette Coleman at his loft and played Broadway revues at retirement communities in New Jersey (sometimes in the same weekend). I was briefly in Chico Hamilton’s band playing guitar, and played bass on Broadway in Fela! the musical. During the tour for Fela! I played with Fela Kuti’s son Femi at the Shrine in Lagos and other venues around the world. I have recorded with artists as diverse as Bebel Gilberto and Beyoncé. I am currently a guitarist in the orchestra for MacArthur Fellowship winner Taylor Mac’s “24 Decade History of Popular Music” as well as the bassist on ABC Network’s “The Gong Show” with host Mike Meyers. I am also the arranger and musical director for The Heathens and other acts based at the fabled Mckittrick Hotel, home of “Sleep No More” in NYC.
I am launching this campaign to finish funding a ""large scale"" recording project I started this past spring. What was begun as a Master's thesis for the completion of my Composition Degree at Queens College has now become a behemoth of musical diversity and exploration. In the process I have realized the importance of properly finishing the project and getting it released in a legit fashion.
So far the whole recording has been paid for by student loans and personal financing. I've now come to the point of needing contributors to get it properly finished, packaged, publicized, and released to the world. Your contribution will help this goal be achieved and birth what I feel to be my most important work to date.

What We Need & What You Get
The goal is to raise $8,000. This will cover most of the costs of recording, musician fees, mixing and mastering, publicist costs, and money for physical merchandise.
The recording is very broad and far reaching, therefore it has required using many musicians to complete. At current count there are over 30 musicians (!) on the record. As there is still one more song to be recorded, this number could go up to 40. The vast majority of the money raised will go towards musician fees. The contributors are an extremely diverse group culled from top players across scenes and genres I have traversed over my years in NYC. They all have contributed not just time and skill, but love and soul to this project.
The record has also utilized 4 recording studios (and a couple of non-traditional recording facilities) and 4 engineers for tracking. The second largest portion of funds goes to these expenses.
The record is being mixed by the legendary Scott Harding. The third allotment of funds goes to the mixing and mastering of the record.
The record needs design, manufacturing, and distribution of the final product. Although it will be available on the internet for streaming and download, I am also providing physical copies (CD with full liner notes). Any one who donates $20 or more will receive a CD with full artwork and digital download link.
I am confident I can reach the goal, however, if we fall short I will distribute the money to the musicians and engineers first.

The Impact
This project is important to me, and I believe to the community, in many ways.
First of all, it provides an opportunity for wide scale, non-commercially based art music to be created and disseminated without any constrictions on the creator. I have made the music I heard in my head, with some help and guidance from mentors, but without a label or an entity that needed to change or decide things based on commerce. This is extremely important in the world where decisions on what we hear and consume are being made on almost entirely commercial factors. 
Secondly it employs a large number of top musicians and brings people together from varied backgrounds, both socially and musically. It really is a boundary-less community I am involved in and it is important for me to create and share music made this way with the world.
I've produced and performed on many records at this point in my career. In addition to being a side person on a lot of records, I have 3 instrumental records and 2 singer songwriter records as a bandleader. All of these I've produced myself and have used my community to help in the process. 
Making this record is currently the number one focus of my career and will be a very important milestone.

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Bonnie Lowdermilk and excited to talk about my upcoming new CD,
""Borderless Crossings"".  In summer of 2014 I did a 15,000
foot pass on a trek to Machu Picchu.  It occurred to me that the arduous
ascent was a metaphor for the difficult transitions I'd made in life
to become a more complete person and musician.  I summited the peak and saw the
other side, and crossed over into new territory where former borders of fear
and psychological impediments had been torn down.  Today, I live more and more
on the other side of these borderless crossings.  The journey became a
song, and the song became a title track.</p>
<p>That same summer I was awarded the ""Pathways To Jazz""
Grant by the Boulder County Arts Alliance to make a jazz CD.  It was
so wonderful to go into the studio and just create music, free from the kind of
psychological impediments that had hindered me so much in life.  And
it was magical the way the music came together.  For example, I wrote some
songs specifically for this album.  I had the melody, chords, lyrics, but
I really had no concept of how the music would sound when we played it
together.  I was blown away by the rich textures, colors, and flavors that
resulted.  The stellar cast of musicians include Art Lande on piano, Ron
Miles (cornet), Gonzalo Teppa (bass), and Paul Romaine (drums).  </p>
<p>The Pathways to Jazz Grant supplied me with resources to make
a wonderful recording.  Now I'm seeking
funding for the final product - a jazz CD, available to the public as a CD or
digital download.  I'm in the process of doing the
mastering, song licensing, artwork, and duplication.</p>
<p>We'd be so grateful for any support you'd like to give
us.  Just choose one of the perks that
feels right for you, and join us, on these Borderless Crossings!  I can't wait to celebrate with you at the CD <strong>release party</strong> at Boulder Piano Gallery Performance Space on <strong>November 21</strong> at 7:30pm <strong>with the musicians</strong>!!  (See the perks for more info on that.)  And if you can't make the release party, but want to contribute more, let me know and I'll use your release admit for a volunteer or someone who can't afford the ticket!  We will play a <strong>concert</strong> of songs from the CD with myself,  Art Lande, Josh Reed (subbing for Ron Miles), Gonzalo Teppa, and Paul Romaine.</p>

<h3>Where I've Been (Believing Again)</h3>
<p>I can't believe it has been over 6 years since I released my EP! </p>
<p>That was such a huge step for me in believing in myself and seeing myself as a musician.  I'm so thankful for that process.  However, coming out of that, it never felt like it was completely me - this Singer-Songwriter/ Folk style EP.  It was a huge piece of my heart and opened me up to writing and recording, but I knew I needed to find myself in a more full and authentic way.   </p>
<p>So, for the past few years, I've been studying music, writing new songs, and discovering more of my sound.  I got to work on a showcase with a 9 piece band that really helped my see where I could take my songs, and own this bigger Pop/Rock sound that feels so much more like me.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526597056/qgv1avftujtvsdmvtd6z.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I am so excited for you guys to hear this new album! You'll get to see how my new sound has come together with a full band, and incredible production team. I'm dreaming big and believing I can see my songs come to life in a big way!</p>
<p>Your support through this campaign would help me finish recording the album, have it mixed and mastered, create some amazing album artwork, and help get my songs on the radio, music blogs, and Spotify playlists.   </p>

<p>Releasing an album on your own is a HUGE undertaking!  Thankfully, I have the help and support of some incredibly talented musicians and engineers who believe in me and what I'm doing (not to mention all of my friends, family, and fans (you guys!!) who have given me so much encouragement along the way). </p>
<p>The money from this campaign will go towards:</p>

<li>Completing Recording - $700 (so close to being done!) </li>
<li>Mixing and Mastering - $3,300</li>
<li>Album Artwork - $600-$1,000</li>

<p>It's super exciting, and sometimes overwhelming, to see all the possibilities of what I can do with my music (like make a music video or plan a tour?!) but it doesn't magically happen on its own, and I need your help!  SO to thank you for your support, I've come up with some pretty great perks (I think!) for you guys. </p>

I started making beats in January of 2014 when I received Ableton Live music production software the Christmas before. What inspired me to begin producing was watching the Rapzilla Beat Battle 2013 on YouTube, which is a competition annually held in Tampa Bay, FL where a few selected producers are chosen to show off one minute beats in alternation to win the crowd over. Seeing the videos of the producers getting into their own beats and the creativity flowing through their music made me want to begin producing myself. When I first started making music, I had one goal; make it to the Rapzilla Beat Battle 2014. I hoped and prayed that I would reach my goal, and eventually my prayers were answered. When the time for the beat battle came around, Rapzilla had made a contest for any producer to submit a 1 minute track consisting of two 30 second snippets of their best music.

I started making beats in January of 2014 when I received Ableton Live music production software the Christmas before. What inspired me to begin producing was watching the Rapzilla Beat Battle 2013 on YouTube, which is a competition annually held in Tampa Bay, FL where a few selected producers are chosen to show off one minute beats in alternation to win the crowd over. Seeing the videos of the producers getting into their own beats and the creativity flowing through their music made me want to begin producing myself. When I first started making music, I had one goal; make it to the Rapzilla Beat Battle 2014. I hoped and prayed that I would reach my goal, and eventually my prayers were answered. When the time for the beat battle came around, Rapzilla had made a contest for any producer to submit a 1 minute track consisting of two 30 second snippets of their best music.

<p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know us.  <br/></p>
<p>My Background: I'm Corey Ferrugia, an artist, educator, entrepreneur, social activist and above all, a wide-eyed child at heart. Since graduating from The University of Arizona School of Music, I launched my own company, MyTown Music. In 2012, I packed up everything I had from Arizona and moved to Los Angeles with a dream to show the 
world how my music and the music inside the many young kids I've 
mentored could make a significant and positive impact in the industry, 
culture and most importantly... education.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our
 goal is to raise $80,000. This will go toward the 
recording, production, mixing, mastering and all the other cost 
involved of creating multiple EPs, as well as, documenting the entire experience along the way. This is what we've called our MySong Series- the journey of these four students in producing their own EPs. <br/></p>
<p>Every
 dollar you contribute will not only go toward the making of my record but 
also, we are going to give these four kids the exact same experience. At
 every level of contribution, we are offering some awesome perks including 
handwritten lyrics that we’ll mail to you, CD’s, tee shirts, a private concert and so many other surprises.<br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Our Impact</h3>
<p>This project is special because it's a testament of how an individual making art can empower and mentor young kids to do the same. It's my goal to help them pursue their dreams through education and this campaign.<br/></p>

<p>Help us spread the word about MyTown Music, the MySong Series and this campaign. I strive to empower young artists so the more shares on Facebook, tweets on Twitter, photos on Instagram, and people you tell, the more students I can help reach their dreams.</p>

through each circle of hell in the same order as the epic poem.  <br/><br/>The album 
includes 9 songs for each of the 9 circles of hell, 3 cantos for each of the 3 
sections of hell (incontinence, violence and fraud), one song depicting the 
journey from the 7th to 8th circle and the song ""Superbia""

You might know me because you have one of my tapes, or maybe I'm one of your weird Facebook friends. Maybe I exited your birth canal on September 24th, 1984. Or possibly you know the beautiful lady. Perhaps we are blood related! Or, you could have no idea who I am whatsoever. If you fall into any of these categories (I think I covered everyone in existence), then qualify for reading this.</p><p><b>First</b>: I debated setting up one of these things for this particular purpose for a long time now. It's been on-and-off a ""ok I'm gonna do this"" since last year. On one hand, I felt as if this would be a really silly reason to try and raise funds. It's not benefiting any touring bands, it's not a charity for the needy, it's not helping the (really) poor, homeless, or disabled. I felt as if this may be too self-important or self-centered to make into a real thing. But on the other hand, there <i>are</i> rewards involved in your contributions, and if you are someone whom I care about and/or vice versa, I feel like it's perfectly okay for me to accept help with something. Or maybe you are just swimming in dollar bills because you have a great job, and you like to help people with the excess. Maybe you're a war criminal, and you need something to go on the books to prove that you're not a fascist sociopath. Either way, if you'd like to help me with this, I appreciate it.</p><p><b>Second</b>: The last thing I want, is for someone who can't give, to give. I don't want $50 from you if you live barely paycheck-to-paycheck with debt collectors calling you every morning and afternoon. If you are that person, we're in the same boat, and that boat is precisely why this campaign exists.</p><p>Basically, due to a blizzard of surprise financial woes, car accidents, insurance problems, my difficulty finding work, and intrusive health issues, I am what they would call ""the hole"" to say the least! I have family I need/want to visit, and some stuff I'd like to bring from the east back to the midwest in which I've never been able to find the money/time/space to transport.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Here are the details, and we've only got 2 weeks!</h3><p><b>First</b>: I want to visit my mom, dad and sister, who across the US. I've seen them a few times since I moved, but only for extremely brief periods amidst a tour. The last few times I was going to visit, I had to cancel due to uncontrollable circumstances. I would like to see my sister for her birthday, my parents for their anniversary, my grandmother who is very sick, and my #1 best friend in the world. That requires funds for fuel and a little food.</p><p><b>Second</b>: There is a deductible I have to pay before I can get my car fixed, which is something that is imperative I do before I even attempt to travel. (The damage is due to an accident I got where my tires blew out and I collided with a highway divider). Needless to say, that tour, where I was going to visit Maryland for one day, was abruptly cancelled.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Bang! Crash! Blast-beat!</h3><p></p>A lot of you know that I am a drummer at heart, first and foremost. I've never had a way to get my drums to Chicago. I was just using two cars to get my belongings here in the first place, so I had to leave some furniture, an entire drum set, and other instruments behind. I'd love to get my hands on my drums again. There is actually a band here who I've been wanting to play for and we are all just basically waiting until I can get my drums back to have a first rehearsal! This is actually another good chunk of the reason why I want to make this trip, and specifically outside of a tour. This way, I will have room for the drums, instead of having a car full of friends and gear getting in the way.<p></p><p></p><h3>If You Can't Help</h3><p>I love you anyway! If you want to help in a way that doesn't involve money, there is really not much I can suggest for you. I hate to say it, but the root of all evil is exactly what I need to be able to get home, let alone home and back. My happiness in seeing my peeps will take care of the rest. Don't feel guilty! Don't feel pressured! If you like having fun and/or making art, there is a <b>mixtape opportunity</b> below for you to submit to.

I will pay for the shipping of perks with my own money when I get back home.</p><p><b>Third</b>: If I receive more than my goal, I will use the extra money to take my family out to dinner or lunch for my parents' anniversary and my sister's birthday!</p><p></p><h3>Compilation/Mixtape!</h3>If you are interested in submitting a track for the compilation tape/mixtape that will be distributed to those who donate the sufficient amount, please do! I have set no genre limitations, but I suspect most submissions will be experimental in nature considering my social community. Maybe I will have some fun with it and remix a few tracks. Or throw on a few songs I like by other artists. If you don't play music, record yourself reading something. Record your TV with your smartphone. Send me a funny voicemail someone sent you. Leave me a voicemail. Send me someone else's song. These tapes will be free to contributors, and not sold, so anything goes. It'll be fun. There is no time limit but please be modest.

<div>My name is Dan Romans. I'm a musician living in New York City. In addition to drumming, singing and playing keyboard I am a composer and songwriter. I have a band called the DRX that is my compositional vessel. Although the DRX has been inactive for long periods of time it has existed, produced albums and performed live since 2009. The DRX is a unique and dynamic rock band. The music is heavy, emotive, and lush and marries a diverse set of musical tones into a cohesive sound. Explore the first two albums by the DRX at <a href=""thedrx.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://thedrx.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://thedrx.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">thedrx.bandcamp.com</a>.</div>
<div><span class="""" style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 30px;"">The Purpose</span></div>
</div><div> <p>This campaign is meant to support the completion and release of a concept album entitled <i>Throughout Within</i>. The writing of this album started in 2011 and has slowly progressed amidst other musical endeavors, work and the activity of life. After completing the writing of this album, rehearsing the material and organizing logistics I am now in the last phase of the recording process. Vocals will be tracked during April, the album will be mixed during May and then mastered and completed in the beginning of June. </p>
<p>Your contribution will help me compensate the wonderful musicians and technicians who have offered me their skill and talent to produce my vision. Some because they require it and all because they deserve it. This album, as it is intended to be, would not be possible without their efforts nor would the act of creating it be quite as gratifying. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Album</h3> <p><i>Throughout Within</i> is a full length album with a total of eight tracks nearing one hour in play. It is grand in scope and deep in meaning. The album is conceptual in its lyrics and music. </p>
<p>The story of the album is about the understanding of our existence, socially and spiritually. The story of the album confronts the topics of oppression, the many forms of inconspicuous modern slavery, denial and irresponsibility, fear and depression, disconnection, anger and shame and ultimately, perspective and unity.</p>
<p>The songs of the album are wholly thematic and motif based. They are melodically, harmonically and rhythmically aligned and reflective. From a hardcore breakdown, to a choral passage to a pop chorus; each moment of this album is a seamless and uninterrupted immersion into one world.

<p>You should contribute to this campaign if you have an interest in what I have created, a fondness of music, an appreciation for art.

My name is Dan Romans. I'm a musician living in New York City. In addition to drumming, singing and playing keyboard I am a composer and songwriter. I have a band called the DRX that is my compositional vessel. Although the DRX has been inactive for long periods of time it has existed, produced albums and performed live since 2009. The DRX is a unique and dynamic rock band. The music is heavy, emotive, and lush and marries a diverse set of musical tones into a cohesive sound. Explore the first two albums by the DRX at thedrx.bandcamp.com.
The Purpose
 This campaign is meant to support the completion and release of a concept album entitled Throughout Within. The writing of this album started in 2011 and has slowly progressed amidst other musical endeavors, work and the activity of life. After completing the writing of this album, rehearsing the material and organizing logistics I am now in the last phase of the recording process. Vocals will be tracked during April, the album will be mixed during May and then mastered and completed in the beginning of June. 
Your contribution will help me compensate the wonderful musicians and technicians who have offered me their skill and talent to produce my vision. Some because they require it and all because they deserve it. This album, as it is intended to be, would not be possible without their efforts nor would the act of creating it be quite as gratifying. 
    The Album Throughout Within is a full length album with a total of eight tracks nearing one hour in play. It is grand in scope and deep in meaning. The album is conceptual in its lyrics and music. 
The story of the album is about the understanding of our existence, socially and spiritually. The story of the album confronts the topics of oppression, the many forms of inconspicuous modern slavery, denial and irresponsibility, fear and depression, disconnection, anger and shame and ultimately, perspective and unity.
The songs of the album are wholly thematic and motif based. They are melodically, harmonically and rhythmically aligned and reflective. From a hardcore breakdown, to a choral passage to a pop chorus; each moment of this album is a seamless and uninterrupted immersion into one world. The composition presents a diverse array of variations that are always anchored by repeating hooks. 
The core instrumentation of Throughout Within is voice, tenor saxophone, keyboard, electric guitar, synth bass and drum set with additional instrumentation on several tracks including clarinet, trumpet, flugelhorn, bass saxophone, violin, cello, electric cello and choir. 
The album is engineered by Jon Grabowski and Tyler Hartman, mixed by Vince Welch (Bent Knee) and includes performance by members of these bands: Beauchene Skulls, Blank Paper, Buke and Gase, Jerseyband, Kayo Dot, Mount Gomery, My Mountain, Emily Peal and Stern.
    The Request I am reaching out to you, my community and fellow humans, to inspire and request your participation in this campaign and consequently in the full potential of this album. My goal is to raise $2000 to supplement the expenditure of my own earnings and properly compensate the musicians and technicians who have given me their skill, talent, effort and time and have helped me to produce a beautiful and evocative recorded shareable version of my music and message.  The collected contributions from this campaign will be solely dedicated to the production and release of this album.

    The Incentive I regret asking for money because I do not value money and feel it is divisive and destructive to our society, however, it is integral to the strong standing paradigm that we live in and it is a tool I must use amongst convention. Considering this, I must allow a balance and accept the usage of the thing that I criticize; knowing that I am using it out of necessity to produce something that is indeed wholesome.
You should contribute to this campaign if you have an interest in what I have created, a fondness of music, an appreciation for art. You should contribute if it will make you feel a part of this work, connected to the message, a promoter of expression. You should contribute to this campaign as much for yourself as you would for me. To put energy into something that you can adopt.

I encourage you to share this information with anyone you think would be interested in the DRX and my new album, Throughout Within. For every word of this you've read and every thought put towards it and every consideration or contribution I extend the most profound thanks and praise. As I have extracted this music from my mind, body and spirit my greatest hope and reward will be to share what I have created with others and pass on a message and experience of realization and positivity.

<p><b><i>EGREM in CUBA:</i> <i>Digging in the
Crates of the Island of Music</i></b> is a multi-media project which celebrates half
a century of Cuba’s music production and recordings at EGREM (Empresa de Grabaciones
y Ediciones Musicales), Spanish for Recordings and Musical Editions Enterprise.
On March 31, 1964, EGREM was born, heir to all the record labels that existed
previously in Cuba. EGREM is the oldest Cuban record company founded after 1959,
and is home to numerous labels including the original EGREM label, and sub-labels
such as the renowned <i>Areito</i> and <i>Siboney</i>. EGREM is also home to the <i>Estudio</i> EGREM recording studio which is known as the home of the <i>Buena Vista Social Club</i> project, which
brought a revival of international attention and interest to Cuban music over
the past decade.</p><p><b>THE EGREM PROJECT.</b></p>
<p>The EGREM project consists of a
coffee table book with original images of album covers of the most important
records in the label’s history. The book will be accompanied by a compilation
CD and a feature length documentary DVD with interviews of the musicians,
technicians, label employees and executives, visual artists and graphic
designers, who have nurtured and maintained the label over the last 50 years.</p>
<p>This will be the first
multi-media project to pay tribute to EGREM; the most extensive historical
account of one of the world’s most complete and influential collections of
Cuban music. By documenting fifty years of recordings, graphic design, pressing
and distribution, the EGREM project will reveal, for the first time, the behind
the scenes history of the birth and development of contemporary Cuban recorded
music. It will be a testament to the impact of the record label and it’s
recordings in Cuba and around the globe, and will provide a visual history of
the vibrant subculture of record collecting through the art of the album cover.
It is essential simply because it will vividly explore an element of music
culture that has withered with the advent of MP3’s and digital downloading:
vinyl records and the stories behind them.</p><p>This multi-media project will gather together a unique and worldly selection of records and covers that spin deep, bizarre, and mind-boggling narratives. The project is not deciphering mysteries but merely re-discovering and re-introducing those records to old and new generations of music fans, DJ’s and record collectors, just adding and paying homage to the mythos and legacy of those records and recordings.<br/></p><p><b>THE GOAL.</b></p>
<p>This project can’t be completed
without your support. We need to raise $25,000 (more than $5,000 will be consumed itself on IndieGogo and PayPal fees as well shipment of perks) for the ""first stage"" of the project:
shooting the documentary part.  Funds will be spent exclusively on hiring photographers, cinematographers and a production team to shoot for a whole month throughout the country and interview musicians, technicians, employees and executives behind the label. By the end of May we hope to have enough material to edit a trailer to attract potential producers for post-production funds and distribution of the whole project. Funds in this ""first stage"" will
be also used for digitization of all of the record covers.</p><p><b>THE ULTIMATE GOAL.</b></p><p>To have the book and documentary ready in December of 2014 to be presented at <i>Festival of Nuevo Cine Latinoamericano de la Habana</i>. The book, compilation CD and documentary will be released exclusively in the U.S and Europe.</p><p><b>WHY EGREM? WHY VINYLS?</b></p>
<p>EGREM is the quintessential
Cuban label. For nearly 35 years, EGREM remained the only record label in Cuba and
was the place where Cuba’s most celebrated artists made their first recordings.
From <i>Chucho Valdes &amp; Irakere, Frank
Fernandez, and Omara Portuondo</i>, to <i>Adalberto
Álvarez, Juan Formell y Los Van Van, Elena Burke, Silvio Rodriguez</i> and <i>Pablo Milanes</i>, EGREM has been the cradle
of Cuban music recordings and continues to house the most extensive catalog of
Cuban music across genres in the world. With over 10,000 published masters of <i>Rumba, Cha-cha-cha, Guaracha, Danzon, Mambo,
Son, Bolero, Classical, Salsa, Rock,</i> <i>Hip
Hop</i> and <i>Fusion, </i>EGREM has also
hosted international legends such as <i>Nat
King Cole, Josephine Baker, Sonia Silvestre, Soledad Bravo, Vicente Garrido,
Susana Baca, and Roy Brown</i>. </p>
<p>It is a vast archive that holds
true musical gems. Imagine a small island like Cuba -with a population of 11
million inhabitants- that many referred as <i>La
Isla de la M</i><i>úsica</i> (the Island of Music)
because such extensive musical history, traditions and richness in music and
musical genres, and ALL of this music for fifty years,
being absorbed in his vast majority by just one record label.</p>
<p>Until the early 90’s EGREM
catalogue was published and printed solely on Vinyl, which today have become
collector’s items and very hard to find pieces developing a vast cult of music
aficionados who try to catch them when it is possible in records stores and
fairs around the globe. Vinyl records possess a visual as well an aural
capacity for storytelling. The record cover -often eye candy for the music
lover- speaks a language rooted in the environment and era of the music itself.
A record can create a profound sense of intimacy with its owner, and it's this
relationship that we all share. Every album cover tells a story and speaks
directly to the people who make music relevant and popular. By putting them
together in a book -as both archive and sideshow- we can easily evaluate and
define the visual and sonic aesthetics of a whole era.</p><p><b>READY TO JOIN ME?</b></p>

A record can create a profound sense of intimacy with its owner, and it's this
relationship that we all share. Every album cover tells a story and speaks
directly to the people who make music relevant and popular. By putting them
together in a book -as both archive and sideshow- we can easily evaluate and
define the visual and sonic aesthetics of a whole era.READY TO JOIN ME?

<p>Lots of people believe in me and support my music and that`s what makes me keep going. Because of them, I am determent to get my songs out there for you to enjoy.

<h3>Who We Are and Our Campaign?</h3>
<p>We are group of passionate entrepreneurs and mobile applications development professionals who have created a number of successful mobile applications projects over the period of time [See portfolio section for reference].<br/></p>
<p>We have developed WorldRadios application for iPhone and launched it back in May 2011 with the intention to offer a verity of radio content for iPhone users. Since then more then 100,000+ copies of this application have been downloaded in different app-stores worldwide. We have received enormous feedbacks from the users asking to make improvements, enhance features, refresh the user interface and port the application to other platforms, especially Android.</p>
<p>As this application is being offered free of cost to the audience (and is planned to remain free forever), and we can't invest much on our own to invest into the application for these enhancements, however we are willing to contribute to run this project and come up with an enhanced product based on the requirements of the users.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>You as a contributor to the project would help us to make this project happen to bring a new life to the application for iPhone devices while bring to to reality for Android phones and tablets. And of course help us to keep this app offered as free of cost for public.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As a note, we must make this project happen if we get at-least some funding and would divide the project into different phases based on the funds we'll get.</p>
<p>The costs would be for following services where the money would be spent,</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Hire professional graphics designer and usability experts for the new user interface designs</li>
<li>Hire the mobile applications development professionals for developing Android application and make enhancements to the iPhone version.</li>
<li>Hiring Quality Assurance and Testing professional</li>
<li>Purchasing hardware resources required to develop and test the applications.</li>
<li>Pay the incubator rent and utility bills.</li>
<li>Other miscellaneous costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>* We  would be offering our management and project leading services without any cost.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As a contributor and backer to this project, in addition to free application you can get following (as perks to the project),</p>
<ul>
<li> Your name under contributors section of the application and product website for lifetime of the application.</li>

Who We Are and Our Campaign?
We are group of passionate entrepreneurs and mobile applications development professionals who have created a number of successful mobile applications projects over the period of time [See portfolio section for reference].
We have developed WorldRadios application for iPhone and launched it back in May 2011 with the intention to offer a verity of radio content for iPhone users. Since then more then 100,000+ copies of this application have been downloaded in different app-stores worldwide. We have received enormous feedbacks from the users asking to make improvements, enhance features, refresh the user interface and port the application to other platforms, especially Android.
As this application is being offered free of cost to the audience (and is planned to remain free forever), and we can't invest much on our own to invest into the application for these enhancements, however we are willing to contribute to run this project and come up with an enhanced product based on the requirements of the users.
What We Need & What You Get

You as a contributor to the project would help us to make this project happen to bring a new life to the application for iPhone devices while bring to to reality for Android phones and tablets. And of course help us to keep this app offered as free of cost for public.


As a note, we must make this project happen if we get at-least some funding and would divide the project into different phases based on the funds we'll get.
The costs would be for following services where the money would be spent,


Hire professional graphics designer and usability experts for the new user interface designs
Hire the mobile applications development professionals for developing Android application and make enhancements to the iPhone version.
Hiring Quality Assurance and Testing professional
Purchasing hardware resources required to develop and test the applications.
Pay the incubator rent and utility bills.
Other miscellaneous costs.

* We  would be offering our management and project leading services without any cost.



As a contributor and backer to this project, in addition to free application you can get following (as perks to the project),

 Your name under contributors section of the application and product website for lifetime of the application.
You can be part of 100 beta users who can get the application copy prior to launch for iPhone/iPad.
You can be part of 500 beta users who can get the application copy prior to launch for Android.
You can get the WorldRadios designed T-Shirt with international shipping, colours available are Black, White, Grey and Blue.













You can get WorldRadios branded premier quality stereo earphones (either for android or iPhone device).




Expected Features for Newer Version:

Here is the list of planned features for newer version planned as result of this project,

Enhanced rich user interface for iPhone application.
Support for iPad devices.
Design and host a dedicated product web-site
A newer version for Android phones and tablets.
Recording playing radio streams and playback feature.
Backup the recordings to third party services i.e DropBox, Skydrive etc.
Social sharing of the recordings, channels and programs to Facebook, Twitter and send through email.
User would be able set reminders for the programs and application would alert at the set time.
Social feature for the application where people listening to a particular channel and program can comment and interact.
Stream playing content to external devices through AirPlay.

</div></div>","Who Are We?
We are Vital Signs, an Alternative Rock band from Orlando, Florida. We've been together for over 2 years and played over 70 shows in that time period. We have really tried to cultivate our own original sound while staying within the realms of the Alternative Rock scene.
 In October of last year we took on a new attitude towards our music under the name Vital Signs. Our goal has always been to make really good music so our fans have a great musical experience. We have been working on writing new songs for months and are finally ready to make an EP, but it's been a difficult process trying to afford recordings of our material. We would really like to have recordings that are professional quality. 
That is why we have decided to reach out to you. And... we thought that IndieGoGo was the perfect medium to help us do just that. Any contribution in helping us make this EP would be wonderful, because it has been a dream for us to get to a point where we could professionally make this EP. Achieving this goal means opening doors to bigger and better things for Vital Signs. We want to use this EP to help us nationally expand our audience, to get radio distribution and to get label and press coverage.
