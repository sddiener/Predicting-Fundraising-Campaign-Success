<h3>WHY DO THIS?</h3>
<p>Tone of Color is being created to fill a void within the Home Design Industry. Utilizing brand new social broadcasting technology, Tone of Color is set to become the first website to allow fully interactive color consultations live and in real time. Not only does Tone of Color allow you access to color and design advice anytime, anywhere, but we also setup designer profile pages that allow you to choose Design and Contractor Professionals based upon specialties and ratings that fit your needs.</p>
<p>The most common situation we encounter while working in the Home Design field, is a customer who is on a budget, and simply needs some help sprucing up a room.  The customer tries so hard to describe the layout of the home, so that we know what rooms connect and how, what colors those rooms are, etc.  Its impossible to really visualize it accurately, till now.  </p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Tone Purzycki has spent equal time in both The Creative Arts as well as The Business of Entertainment. His journey began in the outdoors as a Landscape Architect/Contractor. The ability to both design the environment as well as construct them was an allure that ultimately brought Tone into the world of Entertainment. The doors of Hollywood proved challenging to break down, that is until Tone conceived a new form of entertainment that didn't require studio assistance. Alternetreality.com is the worlds first Socially Broadcast-ed Online Entertainment Experience, allowing the audience to have direct contact and influence over the story presented by engaging the characters Live and in Real Time. As Tone’s creative team at Mikrotone Entertainment develops larger scale content, Tone has been busy building a personal brand in the Color Industry. <br/> For the last 4 years, Tone Purzycki has ventured inside the home, providing In-Home Color Consultations to residents of the Northern New Jersey area. Based on his success with the technology used for Alternetreality.com, he began coordinating and presenting Socially Broadcast-ed Live Seminars covering all ends of the Home Design Industry. It was all these ventures combined, that led Tone to the creation of Tone of Color, the first ever Social Broadcast Color Consultation company, or “Color Concast”.</p>

A mobile app for iPhone and 
Android allows people to share good On-the-Go. You can stay updated on 
what’s going on in your network of friends, groups and organizations. 
Post your own inspiring stories, news or photos and videos of your best 
moments captured from your mobile device.










ShareGood is an alternative to the current social networks that don't focus on #Good. We all use the big social media sites every day and doesn't it seems obvious that personal and worthy messages and missions are too often overlooked? While other social networks are full of meaningless 
noise, ShareGood will be a social platform where everybody comes 
together to make a positive change in the world.








Decrease Worldsuck - this is a word we came to use to describe the lack of good in the world.
Inspire people to believe in the world again
Create a positive alternative to the current social media networks
Participate in a ‘Social Change Network’ – A social tool that will allow people to create petitions and launch a fundraiser for a cause

Allow volunteers, charities, fundraisers, non-profit organizations
         and conscious businesses to network and share good around the world
      
Create mass-scale positive energy around the planet

<p>We are Orangered Life. We celebrate simplicity and smart design. After 3 successful 30° ruler crowdfunding campaigns, £90k+ in funding, and delivering 10,000+ products, we’re back and better with the 30° ruler 4.0! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603338850/phondvswcxizece9pusk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What makes 30° ruler different?</strong></h2>
<p>The key change we've added is a 30° slope on the ruler's face. It's a simple, yet incredibly effective, update and it makes the 30° Ruler <strong>so much easier to use.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603338939/nhwyfcyenliiqdxx6hoc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Instead of a flat ruler, this one is angled at a 30° slope.

We celebrate simplicity and smart design. After 3 successful 30° ruler crowdfunding campaigns, £90k+ in funding, and delivering 10,000+ products, we’re back and better with the 30° ruler 4.0! 

 
What makes 30° ruler different?
The key change we've added is a 30° slope on the ruler's face. It's a simple, yet incredibly effective, update and it makes the 30° Ruler so much easier to use.

 
Instead of a flat ruler, this one is angled at a 30° slope. You can read the measurements from a glance without having to lean over (improving your already questionable posture).  And also you can easily grab it without having to drag it towards the edge of the table.  Finally, the angled nature of the ruler makes it safe for cutting.
 

 
  Apart from its signature sloped design, the 30° Ruler also has a couple of new features.   For starters, the new ruler starts at zero; meaning you can start measuring from the very edge of the ruler instead of having to make adjustments for the useless blank space before the laser engraved measurements.  This 2-in-1 ruler has millimetres and centimetres on one side, inches on the reverse. Inch and centimetres are labelled in the same direction allowing for easy conversions.   The 30° Ruler is designed to eliminate the confusion and strain of reading your typical ruler with every tick mark labelled. On the English side, all hash marks are labelled to eliminate guessing and counting of lines. On the Metric side, both the millimetres and centimetres are numbered and the hash marks rise and fall making it easy to identify specific millimetre measurements.  The ruler itself is made from Aerospace grade aluminium while the measurements are laser targeted. In addition to making it more durable, the materials used also make the 30° Ruler more lightweight and scratch-resistant.   Scratch-resistantWhat’s New？30° Ruler 4.0 is made with the same high-quality Aerospace-grade aluminium while the measurements are laser targeted as the original, but there are a few new things to make it even better:
New wider design for better grip and easier to read.
Larger font size and non-glare surface makes reading quicker and easier in any environment
New colour: vivid white markings with a classic black background.
   Two Colors, Three Sizes.While not all rulers don’t have it (which they definitely should), the 30° Ruler has two different measurements etched on both sides. The ruler also comes in 3 sizes of 6, 8, and 12 inches, so you can choose the right sized ruler depending on what you’re measuring.   Thank youWe are passionate about what we do, and the opportunity to serve you and bring such a fantastic product to market has been an incredible adventure.",16.0,0,"8 Campaigns

<h3>What is wlroots?</h3>
<p>We represent the small-time projects in the Wayland scene. Together we have worked to build a new library to support our compositors: <a href=""https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wlroots</a>. Our new library allows us to share our implementations of important (and difficult!) features, and to promote the adoption of portable standards across the Wayland ecosystem.</p>
<p>Our work is nearing its completion and we're ready to make the final push. Usually, we must work on these projects in our spare time. With your support, a 2 week hackathon of full-time work on our projects will get more done than we might accomplish in a year.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Who's involved?</h3>
<p>The core committers on wlroots will all be there: acrisci, emersion, and SirCmpwn. Together we represent the <a href=""http://swaywm.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sway</a> project. We've also invited Timidger, the maintainer of <a href=""http://way-cooler.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Way Cooler</a>, to join us if we meet our stretch goal. Assisting us remotely (in their spare time) are Ongy, the maintainer of <a href=""https://github.com/ongy/waymonad"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">waymonad</a>, and other contributors to wlroots. Together our work improves the Sway, Way Cooler, Waymonad, and <a href=""https://github.com/Bl4ckB0ne/bspwc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bspwc</a> projects, as well as (hopefully) many future compositors.</p>
<h3>Why is wlroots worth it?</h3>
<p>For Sway and Way Cooler, this library enables us to build features that were never possible without it. Projects like waymonad and bspwc likely wouldn't exist at all if it weren't for wlroots. Features we will be able to support with wlroots include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display rotation and mirroring</li>
<li>More exotic display configurations like daisy-chaining DisplayPort</li>
<li>Touch screen and drawing tablet support</li>
<li>Mixed-DPI desktops and fractional scaling</li>
<li>Third party bars, lock screens, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>A more exhaustive list of features now possible is <a href=""https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/1524"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">available here</a>. The wlroots approach represents a fundamental shift in how we build our compositors together - and we're only scratching the surface of what'll be possible.</p>
<h3>What's the plan?</h3>
<p>We'll gather the wlroots core contributors from around the world at SirCmpwn's Philadelphia apartment from March 26th to April 6th. We will be live streaming our work on Twitch as we work primarily on wlroots and Sway (and on wlroots-rs, Timidger's Rust bindings to wlroots, if we reach our stretch goal).</p>
<p>Your money will be spent on travel costs to bring acrisci and emersion to Philadelphia, from Atlanta, Georgia and Paris, France, respectively. <strong>If we meet our stretch goal of $2000</strong>, we'll also bring Timidger (the maintainer of Way Cooler) in from Boston. These numbers are padded a little bit to accomodate for price changes and unexpected events. The extra will be spent on fulfilling rewards and food for the team, and whatever is left will be stowed away for later use (domains, servers, test hardware, etc).</p>
<h3>What's in it for me?</h3>
<p>Taking time away from our work on the project to fulfill complex rewards is something we want to avoid. However, we want to make sure you're properly thanked for your contribution. We are offering two rewards: access to a special IRC channel for hanging out with us during the hackathon, and a set of stickers from each compositor involved (to be fulfilled a short time after the hackathon is completed). The real reward, however, is the excellent Wayland compositors you'll get to use when we're done! If you wish, you may contribute any amount outside of our reward tiers to show your support for the projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, everyone who supports the hackathon will be thanked by name in the release notes for Sway 1.0, regardless of their level of support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We cannot guarantee that we will complete the products you have been looking forward to, such as Sway 1.0. However, the progress we'll make will dramatically reduce the timeline for the releases of these projects. We are a skilled team of software engineers that are already well aquainted with each other and our codebases, and as a result we expect to be highly productive during this time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please share our campaign with your friends and on whatever social media platforms tickle your fancy! We may also be accepting small donations during the hackathon for food.</p>
<h3>Questions?</h3>
<p>Please reach out to Drew DeVault &lt;<a href=""mailto:sir@cmpwn.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sir@cmpwn.com</a>&gt; via email if you have any questions.</p>

Additionally, everyone who supports the hackathon will be thanked by name in the release notes for Sway 1.0, regardless of their level of support.

Risks & Challenges
We cannot guarantee that we will complete the products you have been looking forward to, such as Sway 1.0. However, the progress we'll make will dramatically reduce the timeline for the releases of these projects. We are a skilled team of software engineers that are already well aquainted with each other and our codebases, and as a result we expect to be highly productive during this time.

Other Ways You Can Help
Please share our campaign with your friends and on whatever social media platforms tickle your fancy! We may also be accepting small donations during the hackathon for food.

<li><p>Enter your friend’s Santcoin ID number,</p></li>
<li><p>Put in the amount, and press Send.</p></li>

<p>Zap! Now the first half of the transaction is complete – the money has left your account and entered our system and has generated a unique one-time use 10-digit code that identifies the transaction.</p>
<p>You take this 10-digit code and give it to your friend by any means you like. You can send it in a text message, a phone call, an Email, whatever is easiest.</p>
<p>Then he performs his half of the transaction – he simply enters the ten-digit code into his app on his phone. The system authenticates the transaction, and the exact amount you’ve sent is added to his balance. Done! There are no service fees, no hassles, and no chance of being hacked.</p>

<p>In these days of digital commerce, we are sending money electronically all the time. However, there are hackers everywhere, trying their best to get their grubby hands on your money. Plus, most of the existing payment services charge hefty fees.</p>
<p>What if I could tell you it didn’t need to be that way? Would you be interested? I’ll bet you would. Our SantCoin program offers you a whole new way.</p>
<p>This new platform gives you a way to securely send money from your phone to an individual anywhere in the world, regardless if he has a bank account, an Internet connection, or even a Government-issued identity card. And here’s the big reveal – it’s FREE.</p>
<p>SantCoin is the answer. You’ve heard of Bitcoin – SantCoin is the next generation of digital currency and we have added many improvements over the original platform. This an app we  have developed that is fast, simple, secure, and incredibly easy to use, even for people who are not Internet-savvy.</p>
<p>We have improved the security of your transactions, the anonymity, the profitability, even the options to add advertising, and tracking.</p>
<p>In 2015, Payments made with debit and credit cards and other non-cash methods jumped 9 percent last year to 390 billion transactions, Capgemini report said.</p>
<p>In USA, the credit  cards number average per consumer is 4.4 , one in ten Americans has more than 10 credit cards. and the card payment users expect more than 35.54 billion as potential worldwide losses because of payment card fraud in 2020.</p>
<p>With a number of smartphone users is forecast to grow to around 2.5 billion in 2019. Mobile payments grew significantly in volume – by 170 percent – to reach 4.5 billion transactions. and there is many reason for that.</p>
<p>Making payment from phone is more convenient and less time consuming, and shopper more likely to use their coupons when they use phone to pay, and unlike the credit card, tracking and recovering your phone in case it gets lost is much easier, and most mobile phones can be locked with a pin, so gaining access to sensitive account information or making transactions is made more difficult.</p>
<p>The speed, security, privacy, information management, simplicity and convenience factors in mobile payments is higher as opposed to credit card payments. There is just one limitation, the cost. The main payment channel for this mobile pay systems still credit and some debit cards. this payment method are operated under financial regulation and require processing the payment by different parties that cost big interchange and processing fees that exceed 20 billion annually just in USA.</p>
<p>Mobile payments technology don’t require a big infrastructure to work. Hundreds millions of merchants around the world will immigrate to mobile phone as an alternative way of payment, but they still have to lose up to 3.5 % of their gross revenue as processing and interchange fees, and in many cases that means the difference between the success and the lose of the business.</p>
<p>Thanks to using a new digital currency concept, SantCoin has none of traditional payment methods limitations, SantCoin  is a scalable system , With an architecture that offer security, audit trail, transparency and speed. And by offering a free service, SantCoin is ideal for merchants and will help them increase their profit and sales.</p>
<p>Further advances could come from SantCoin Engine. The freedom, the new model, and the adaptation ability  give Santcoin the potential to grow fast and win not just the mobile payment contest, but the power to reach the unbanked population and take the leadership in the money transfer game.</p>
<p>Banking the unbanked is a global serious challenge, Different Statistics shows that that is 38 % of the global population that represent 2 billion adults are still unbanked, and others 1.3 billion account-owning adults still use cash to pay utility bills.</p>
<p>this big numbers that reflect 59% of adults in developing economies, or 3/4 of the world’s poor according to The Global Findex do not have a bank account, not only because of poverty, but also due to costs, travel distance and paperwork involved.</p>
<p>SantCoin can solve that, allowing those unbanker poor to get a virtual digital bank checking account using their mobiles without any document requirement, better than that with SanCtion system they will get a free money allotment to start using the system, that is will encourage those unbanked to join the digital banking business, and allow them to send and receive digital money for free, solving the next global issues.</p>
<p>Globally, sending remittances costs an average of 7.37 percent of the amount sent,or 25 billion dollar annually. SantCoin charge no fees for money transfer and will save this full amount. These funds would simply remain to migrants and their families and could contribute significantly to improving the living conditions of the migrants themselves as well as reducing poverty in their countries of origin.</p>

<h1>SantCoin: Digital global currency 2.0</h1>
<p>SantCoin is a new alternative currency with many new features, The American patent application of the new digital currency and the new system was filed in December 2015 by SantCoin Inc., a start-up based in Boston MA USA.</p>
<br/><p>SantCoin is a personal decentralized banking system and a Peer-to-Peer decentralized Payment System. Individuals and merchants can use the SantCoin App to make payments to other individuals or merchants without involving a third-party, such as a bank or financial institution, for the purpose of validation. Instead, transactions are cleared and validated within the system through the closed source. As a precautionary measure, a copy of every device ledger is sent to the cloud and stored permanently in the public ledger that records and publicly displays all SantCoin transactions that have been executed within the SantCoin system.</p>
<br/><p>The SantCoin integrated system allows two parties to settle a transaction outside the traditional financial system, and even outside any network. SantCoin allows online and offline payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through any third party, such as a financial institution (bank) or even any kind of electronic connection or any network like internet, phone network or Wi-Fi.</p>
<br/><p>SantCoin uses a local ledger to store and spend the currency; an integrated algorithm in the closed code source to validate every transaction, and a distributed global ledger technology to monitor the currency transactions.</p>
<br/><p>Each transaction has a special key that represents the transaction information encrypted by the beneficiary SantCoin Address (SantCoin ID); SantCoin Keys must be generated by a computerized method, but it can be printed and stored on paper for the exclusive use by the specific beneficiary. With this exclusive technology SantCoin offers 2 types of personal banking system:</p>
<p>A) An Online banking system that stores digital money on the global digital bank ledger relating to a personal SantCoin Address (SantCoin ID).</p>
<p>B) An Offline banking system that stores digital money on a personal device or a personal printed ledger, both of which are specific to the beneficiary address (SantCoin ID) and can become digital money anytime the beneficiary types the Special Key into his SantCoin App or he connects his device to the internet. The information from every transaction will be sent to the global ledger when one of the transactors connects to the internet.</p>
<h1>SantCoin Advantages</h1>
<p>First of all, SantCoin is a digital currency or virtual currency or virtual money, but it is not a cryptocurrency; it includes many evolutions and improvements from the original bitcoin and other altcoins. A great deal of thought, and development, has gone into the creation of this coin. Most importantly, it is intuitive and easy for a beginner to use! The following Paragraphs outline some of the key improvements introduced in this new coin.</p>
<ul><li><h3>Money back guarantee</h3></li></ul>
<p>SantCoin is the only currency that comes with a lifetime permanent satisfaction, money back guarantee. When you buy or borrow SantCoin packages from SantCoin Inc., you can exchange your coins for goods and services, or you can return the full package at any time to SantCoin Inc. and be refunded 100%.</p>
<p>This lifetime guarantee on the SantCoin packages protects your SantCoins’ value for as long as you can return the full package (the same volume of SantCoin as your purchase). The guarantee is effective even if you sell it, trade it, or give it away! The actual owner of the package will get the refund.  </p>
<ul><li><h3>Mobile User Interface</h3></li></ul>
<p>Our platform is equipped with a mobile application that facilitates the transferring of stored value between two users of the system in the physical world.</p>
<ul><li><h3>Offline Payments</h3></li></ul>
<p>The mobile application has the capability to send, or receive, transactions in an offline state. No other technology is currently offering this.</p>
<ul><li><h3>Unique Technology</h3></li></ul>
<p>Our system introduces a new integrated technology, which is a way of associating your wallet’s Address (SantCoin ID) with your printed or electronic stored money. This unique technology is what enables the offline payment system. When your device generates a transaction key (10 digits), the amount of money is encrypted in this Special Key using your Address as an encryption Key.</p>
<ul><li><h3>Instantaneous</h3></li></ul>
<p>On the SantCoin system transactions take place immediately, it does not take even one second; it is faster than a credit card and all other cryptocurrencies. That is because SantCoin is not a cryptocurrency; there is no mining process and no external verification needed.</p>
<ul><li><h3>Privacy protection</h3></li></ul>
<p>The SantCoin system does not require any personal information to get a user’s address (SantCoin ID). Sending, storing, and receiving money can be done with absolute anonymity unless the user has chosen to share some information.</p>
<br/><ul><li><h3>Worldwide Coin Distribution</h3></li></ul>
<p>SantCoin is a global and borderless currency. It can be used anywhere, anytime, and upon launch of the coin, every person around the world will be eligible to receive an allotment of the digital currency.</p>
<ul><li><h3>Democratic</h3></li></ul>
<p>SantCoin is not a democracy friendly currency just because anybody can create an equal share of the currency; better than that, SantCoin has a voting system that allows the community to make decisions over the currency, conditional upon 80% of voters being in agreement.</p>
<ul><li><h3>Autonomous</h3></li></ul>
<p>SantCoin is not regulated by any government or financial institution. SantCoin is the only system that does not need the internet to function; users can generate transaction keys in places where there is no internet connection.

<p>New Digital currency, way not bitcoin?</p>
<p>What are bitcoins, Altcoins, and cryptocurrency?Bitcoin, or cryptocurrency, is a new phenomenon that is disrupting the financial sector. It was launched by an anonymous person, or group, as an electronic store of value, that could become more stable than fiat currency.</p>
<p>Due to Bitcoin’s surge in growth, and a lack of centralized development / evolution, the blockchain is becoming quickly dated. Bitcoin remains static, and un-evolving, while the community argues over how to improve the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Another major disadvantage of bitcoin is its sheer complexity.  Attempting to understand how bitcoin works and exactly how transactions are verified can leave many people shaking their heads in confusion.  As a result, some people are unwilling to commit to a monetary concept they can’t manage to grasp.</p>
<p>All the while, altcoins are released that push the envelope of the technology. Coins like Lite coin and Dark coin are born from a lack of Bitcoin’s ability to evolve.</p>
<p>Our Santcoin is jam packed with features, and will evolve over time… More importantly than any of the features listed above, are two key principles that were employed while creating this coin.</p>
<ul><li><p>SantCoin is not another Altcoin!</p></li></ul>
<p>Altcoins have proven to be clones, and sometimes clones of clones. The original Bitcoin source code is taken, and slightly modified or reconfigured to suit a different user group, and re-released under a different name… We DO NOT fall under this category! This coin employs new tactics, environmental features, and technologies.</p>
<ul><li><h2>Decentralization vs No Organization </h2></li></ul>
<p>As noted above, one of the primary flaws with Bitcoin is the lack of evolution. This lack of evolution comes from a stalemate that has been caused by the lack of an authority, and arguments between people that believe they are empowered, or represent sections of the community stalling progress.</p>
<p>This coin is designed with foresight, and with a method of appointing a committee that represents the coin’s best interests. The coin can still be decentralized, and stable, while empowering a committee to make decisions and evolve.</p>
<h1>Conclusion: SantCoin is Superior to Bitcoin </h1>
<p>As mentioned throughout this campaign, Bitcoin simply has not evolved over time, and a sea of Altcoins has been released due to the lack of organization within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Our new Santcoin system desires to make significant improvements to the feature set of Bitcoin, while also fixing the flaws that allowed this stalemate to occur within that community.</p>
<p>This coin is designed to empower the world to use digital currency, and to bring an easy-to-use interface into the mainstream. Utilizing offline modes, “TargetID Technology”, to facilitate transactions. this coin is moving into new and innovative areas.</p>

<p>Poverty: The plague we can treat.</p>
<p>The plague was the most devastating disaster in human history. For anybody who lived in that age, finding a cure for this Black Death would have been the top priority.</p>
<p>In our time, we are also experiencing huge losses, due to an old plague, capable of corrupting our minds so that even we believe it is untreatable; it is poverty, which, like any other disease, could be cured with cooperation and innovation.</p>
<h1>Symptoms: pollution, illness, death, crime, immigration, wars and more bad things...</h1>
<p>Children from poor families are more likely to die at birth or in infancy than children born into richer families. They are more likely to suffer chronic illness during childhood or to have a disability and if they live to be seniors, their life average is 8 years shorter than for a wealthy person.</p>
<br/><p>Poverty causes illness and premature death; 842 million people are undernourished and malnutrition is the cause of death for more than 8000 children under 5 every day; that is 3.1 million children every year. 300 million children go to sleep hungry or cold each night and 250,000 to 500,000 children go blind annually from vitamin A deficiency, half of whom die within 12 months.</p>
<br/><p>Poverty increases the risk of homelessness. There are over 100 million street children and the remaining poor children live in bad housing with bad sanitation and lack of basic hygiene, which makes it easier to spread old and new diseases; hunger and lack of water make people more vulnerable to these diseases.</p>
<p>Poverty creates an environment where kids can't simply go to school. Poor children often work to provide an income for their family, facing crippling accidents due to unsafe working environments and other work hazards such as lead poisoning, pesticide poisoning and bites from wild animals. And for those who can actually go to school, they simply don't see how education can improve their life because they see educated relatives unable to find a job.</p>
<br/><p>Children from low income families often forgo events that most of us take for granted. They miss school trips, can’t invite friends round for tea and can’t afford a one-week holiday away from home.</p>
<br/><p>Poverty badly affects a person’s personality, body and brain. Children born in the poorest areas, on average, weigh 200 grams less at birth than those born in the richest areas. Children from poorer backgrounds lag at all stages of education and people of limited means are more likely to make mistakes and bad decisions that may be amplified by, and perpetuate, their financial woes. This has significant effects on their physical and mental health, as well as their educational achievement. Without an education, people are unlikely to find a paying job.</p>
<br/><p>When they are unemployed and homeless, social unrest can take over, which leads to increases in crime. When they have nothing, no money to buy necessities, they may be forced to turn to theft in order to survive.</p>
<br/><p>Homelessness and high crime rates impact on a country’s people and can create many problems within society; crime prevents businesses from thriving because it generates instability and uncertainty.</p>
<br/><p>Poverty fuels terrorism by creating a state of misery and frustration that pushes people to join terrorist organizations; most terrorists come from poor countries with high unemployment and terrorist organizations often provide salaries. The relationship is explicit between poverty and terrorism and other self-destructing plagues such as addictive substance abuse and trying to cope with huge amounts of stress and despair.</p>
<br/><p>Poverty hurts economics, peoples and nations; it is a major cause of social tensions and threatens to divide nations. It can lead to terrorism, wars, mass emigrationand environmental destruction and outcomes such as an increased number of riots and clashes. The Arab Spring is a great example of how revolts can start because of few job opportunities and high poverty levels.</p>
<br/><p>Poverty causes ignorance, disease, war, famine; it weakens families, traps individuals and decreases mobility. It causes unemployment, stagnation and reversal of human progress and leads to a breakdown of civilization.</p>
<br/><p>Poverty is a very dangerous factor that can destabilize an entire world. It is therefore a very expensive proposition for all of us. If allowed to run unchecked, it will result in terrible living conditions for nearly everyone until it threatens the very existence of the human race.  </p>
<br/><p>However, the worst thing about the poverty is the vicious cycle that forces people to inherit lifelong handicaps and troubles that are passed on from one generation to another.</p>
<br/><p>The best thing is, for the first time in the history, we have the ability to break the poverty cycle. We know what poverty causes, but to be able to overcome it, we first need to figure out what poverty is, and what causes it.</p>
<p>Diagnosis: Wealth inequality</p>
<p>By definition, poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing, shelter and education (we call this extreme or absolute poverty), but poverty in general is lacking the required amount to fulfil basic standards of living.</p>
<p>We have a rising concentration of global wealth, estimated to be almost half of the world’s wealth, now owned by just 1 percent of the population who own $110 trillion, which is 65 times the total wealth of the bottom half of the world’s population.</p>
<p>1125 dollar billionaires own $4.4 trillion; that represent four times more than the accumulated worth of 50% of the poor people of the world. In most countries with available data, the share held by the 1 percent wealthiest population is rising at the expense of the bottom 90 percent population.</p>
<p>By supporting the monetary development policy, economies could prosper, health could improve and countries could develop into strong global presences. All countries will benefit when decreasing global poverty becomes established.</p>
<p>Poverty and wealth inequality are intrinsically linked; all the evidence confirms that rising inequality and poverty are related and showsthat a more equal distribution of income and assets can foster growth, whereas high inequality can retard it. Thus, reducing inequalities can be doubly beneficial for the poor.</p>
<h1>Treatment: monetary policy.</h1>
<ul><li><p>wealth distribution monetary policy</p></li></ul>
<p>If poverty occurs when the wealth is poorly distributed among peoples and when a tiny minority has a majority of the money, what we call inequality, than poverty (and inequality) is reversible.</p>
<p>The increasing levels of economic inequality have a connection with decreasing levels of economic mobility and rising levels of poverty. There is an untapped potential for reducing poverty through wealth distribution, and poverty reduction can be greatly enhanced through distributional policies.</p>
<p>Influenced by the power of technology to find creative solutions for complicated issues, the SantCoin vision considers that poverty is not an exception. Tackling inequality by a monetary policy does not harm growth, provided this policy is well designed and implemented.</p>
<ul><li><h2>Development and collaboration fund</h2></li></ul>
<p>Small changes in distribution can have a very large effect on poverty reduction and the global distribution of SantCoin digital currency could make that explicit, but distribution objectives, particularly for assets, should be an integral part of the cooperation and development fund. It follows that a currency policy should not only be pursued to reduce income inequalities but also to sustain long-term growth.</p>
<p>SantCoin digital currency policy has a dual approach; to end poverty and its effects first and then support the global cooperation and development effort through local government lead by technology.</p>
<p>SantCoin policy gives priority to the eight areas deemed necessary for securing the welfare or happiness of any individual or community, as f:</p>

How to Earn Money with Santcoin? Here







What if I have a question isn’t answered here?
We’re happy to respond to any other queries you might have about the SantCoin Engine , the Indiegogo campaign, and our company as a whole. 
Email us at: admin@santcoin.com / santcoin@hotmail.com



In these days of digital commerce, we are sending money electronically all the time. However, there are hackers everywhere, trying their best to get their grubby hands on your money. Plus, most of the existing payment services charge hefty fees.
What if I could tell you it didn’t need to be that way? Would you be interested? I’ll bet you would. Our SantCoin program offers you a whole new way.
This new platform gives you a way to securely send money from your phone to an individual anywhere in the world, regardless if he has a bank account, an Internet connection, or even a Government-issued identity card. And here’s the big reveal – it’s FREE.
SantCoin is the answer. You’ve heard of Bitcoin – SantCoin is the next generation of digital currency and we have added many improvements over the original platform. This an app we  have developed that is fast, simple, secure, and incredibly easy to use, even for people who are not Internet-savvy.
We have improved the security of your transactions, the anonymity, the profitability, even the options to add advertising, and tracking.
In 2015, Payments made with debit and credit cards and other non-cash methods jumped 9 percent last year to 390 billion transactions, Capgemini report said.
In USA, the credit  cards number average per consumer is 4.4 , one in ten Americans has more than 10 credit cards. and the card payment users expect more than 35.54 billion as potential worldwide losses because of payment card fraud in 2020.
With a number of smartphone users is forecast to grow to around 2.5 billion in 2019. Mobile payments grew significantly in volume – by 170 percent – to reach 4.5 billion transactions. and there is many reason for that.
Making payment from phone is more convenient and less time consuming, and shopper more likely to use their coupons when they use phone to pay, and unlike the credit card, tracking and recovering your phone in case it gets lost is much easier, and most mobile phones can be locked with a pin, so gaining access to sensitive account information or making transactions is made more difficult.
The speed, security, privacy, information management, simplicity and convenience factors in mobile payments is higher as opposed to credit card payments. There is just one limitation, the cost. The main payment channel for this mobile pay systems still credit and some debit cards. this payment method are operated under financial regulation and require processing the payment by different parties that cost big interchange and processing fees that exceed 20 billion annually just in USA.
Mobile payments technology don’t require a big infrastructure to work. Hundreds millions of merchants around the world will immigrate to mobile phone as an alternative way of payment, but they still have to lose up to 3.5 % of their gross revenue as processing and interchange fees, and in many cases that means the difference between the success and the lose of the business.
Thanks to using a new digital currency concept, SantCoin has none of traditional payment methods limitations, SantCoin  is a scalable system , With an architecture that offer security, audit trail, transparency and speed. And by offering a free service, SantCoin is ideal for merchants and will help them increase their profit and sales.
Further advances could come from SantCoin Engine. The freedom, the new model, and the adaptation ability  give Santcoin the potential to grow fast and win not just the mobile payment contest, but the power to reach the unbanked population and take the leadership in the money transfer game.
Banking the unbanked is a global serious challenge, Different Statistics shows that that is 38 % of the global population that represent 2 billion adults are still unbanked, and others 1.3 billion account-owning adults still use cash to pay utility bills.
this big numbers that reflect 59% of adults in developing economies, or 3/4 of the world’s poor according to The Global Findex do not have a bank account, not only because of poverty, but also due to costs, travel distance and paperwork involved.
SantCoin can solve that, allowing those unbanker poor to get a virtual digital bank checking account using their mobiles without any document requirement, better than that with SanCtion system they will get a free money allotment to start using the system, that is will encourage those unbanked to join the digital banking business, and allow them to send and receive digital money for free, solving the next global issues.
Globally, sending remittances costs an average of 7.37 percent of the amount sent,or 25 billion dollar annually. SantCoin charge no fees for money transfer and will save this full amount. These funds would simply remain to migrants and their families and could contribute significantly to improving the living conditions of the migrants themselves as well as reducing poverty in their countries of origin.



SantCoin: Digital global currency 2.0
SantCoin is a new alternative currency with many new features, The American patent application of the new digital currency and the new system was filed in December 2015 by SantCoin Inc., a start-up based in Boston MA USA.
SantCoin is a personal decentralized banking system and a Peer-to-Peer decentralized Payment System. Individuals and merchants can use the SantCoin App to make payments to other individuals or merchants without involving a third-party, such as a bank or financial institution, for the purpose of validation. Instead, transactions are cleared and validated within the system through the closed source. As a precautionary measure, a copy of every device ledger is sent to the cloud and stored permanently in the public ledger that records and publicly displays all SantCoin transactions that have been executed within the SantCoin system.
The SantCoin integrated system allows two parties to settle a transaction outside the traditional financial system, and even outside any network. SantCoin allows online and offline payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through any third party, such as a financial institution (bank) or even any kind of electronic connection or any network like internet, phone network or Wi-Fi.
SantCoin uses a local ledger to store and spend the currency; an integrated algorithm in the closed code source to validate every transaction, and a distributed global ledger technology to monitor the currency transactions.
Each transaction has a special key that represents the transaction information encrypted by the beneficiary SantCoin Address (SantCoin ID); SantCoin Keys must be generated by a computerized method, but it can be printed and stored on paper for the exclusive use by the specific beneficiary. With this exclusive technology SantCoin offers 2 types of personal banking system:
A) An Online banking system that stores digital money on the global digital bank ledger relating to a personal SantCoin Address (SantCoin ID).
B) An Offline banking system that stores digital money on a personal device or a personal printed ledger, both of which are specific to the beneficiary address (SantCoin ID) and can become digital money anytime the beneficiary types the Special Key into his SantCoin App or he connects his device to the internet. The information from every transaction will be sent to the global ledger when one of the transactors connects to the internet.
SantCoin Advantages
First of all, SantCoin is a digital currency or virtual currency or virtual money, but it is not a cryptocurrency; it includes many evolutions and improvements from the original bitcoin and other altcoins. A great deal of thought, and development, has gone into the creation of this coin. Most importantly, it is intuitive and easy for a beginner to use! The following Paragraphs outline some of the key improvements introduced in this new coin.
Money back guarantee
SantCoin is the only currency that comes with a lifetime permanent satisfaction, money back guarantee. When you buy or borrow SantCoin packages from SantCoin Inc., you can exchange your coins for goods and services, or you can return the full package at any time to SantCoin Inc. and be refunded 100%.

The guarantee is effective even if you sell it, trade it, or give it away! The actual owner of the package will get the refund.  
Mobile User Interface
Our platform is equipped with a mobile application that facilitates the transferring of stored value between two users of the system in the physical world.
Offline Payments
The mobile application has the capability to send, or receive, transactions in an offline state. No other technology is currently offering this.
Unique Technology
Our system introduces a new integrated technology, which is a way of associating your wallet’s Address (SantCoin ID) with your printed or electronic stored money. This unique technology is what enables the offline payment system. When your device generates a transaction key (10 digits), the amount of money is encrypted in this Special Key using your Address as an encryption Key.
Instantaneous

Privacy protection

Worldwide Coin Distribution
SantCoin is a global and borderless currency. It can be used anywhere, anytime, and upon launch of the coin, every person around the world will be eligible to receive an allotment of the digital currency.
Democratic
SantCoin is not a democracy friendly currency just because anybody can create an equal share of the currency; better than that, SantCoin has a voting system that allows the community to make decisions over the currency, conditional upon 80% of voters being in agreement.
Autonomous
SantCoin is not regulated by any government or financial institution. SantCoin is the only system that does not need the internet to function; users can generate transaction keys in places where there is no internet connection. Beneficiary users can store keys on paper for a long time until they get a new phone and install the App and then they can use their printed money.
Environmentally friendly  
Since there is no need to solve very difficult problems to mine the coin, a lot of computer power will be saved and used more efficiently.
Inflation Proof
With only one way to create SantCoin, SantCoin currency volume is controlled and related to the currency community volume, which is exactly the initial share multiplied by the number of people. SantCoins are always created at a predictable and limited rate, related to humans and not some kind of puzzle like the cryptocurrency case, where mining requires a certain amount of machine work for each block of coins.  
Anonymous Targeted Marketing
The SantCoin wallet is equipped with a means of analyzing spending patterns and can target relevant offers and deals to your App without sharing your identity to 3rd parties.

At work, in stores, on a train, on a plane, on a boat with a goat… The paper cup is <i>the</i> emblem of people on the go. These to-go cups have also become the symbol of our throwaway culture. At Vessel we want to show that being productive doesn’t have to mean living disposably, and that living sustainably doesn’t mean sacrificing convenience.

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Customers WIN</h3>
<p>With Vessel's insulated material, customer's drinks stay hot or cold, and thanks to Vessel's beautiful solid material, gone are the days of having to worry about leaky paper cups. Customers also gain access to information about the purchases they are making everyday. Pleasurable drinking experience + access to quantified-self information + lessening personal waste = WIN</p>

<h3>Cafes WIN</h3>
<p>The average cafe spends more money on your paper cup than it does on your coffee beans. Every time a Vessel is scanned out to a customer, the cafe pays Vessel half of what they would be spending on a paper cup. Vessel also alerts customers to Vessel-enabled cafes in their area, bringing new customers through the doors. All while improving corporate social responsibility. Save money + bring in new customers  + reduce waste + improve corporate social responsibility = WIN</p>

<h1>WHAT ABOUT THE PERKS?</h1>
<div><b>Warm Fuzzy's</b></div>
<p>We all have stuff. Lots and lots of stuff.  Did you know that, the average U.S. <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/21/health/la-he-keeping-stuff-20140322"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">household has 300,000 items</a>? We consume <a href=""http://storyofstuff.org/wp-content/uploads/movies/scripts/Story%20of%20Stuff.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">nearly twice as many </a>material goods today as we did 50 years ago and these things, that we've started consuming at a faster rate than ever, end up in storage spaces (which have grown to an upwards of 50,000 in the US) – or in landfills.</p>
<p>This massive-scale stuff accruement is at the heart of what Vessel is trying to remedy.</p>
<p>For every $15 you spend, you replace 2,000 paper and plastic cups with one Vessel. That means for every $15 you spend, you remove 2,000 disposable cups from landfills. </p>
<p><b>""Sponsor-A-Cup"" </b><br/></p>
<p>Along with the sheer joy that comes from knowing you had a hand in making a physical dent in a landfill, with your pledge you also gain access to our ""Sponsor-A-Cup"" program.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When you sponsor a cup, you can receive letters, photos and waste diversion information. This includes updates on where your cup is now, where it's been, and the impact it has been having on the community near and far! You can change a cup’s life from one of hardship and loneliness to one of hope and meaning. <b>You have the opportunity to literally shift the way our culture thinks of disposability and reduce tons of waste – all while looking good!</b></p>

<br/><h1>FAQs</h1>
<br/><p>Q: I am a Cafe and I want this for my customers NOW!</p>
<p>A: We want this for your customers too! We are currently NYC based but are expanding. <a href=""mailto:info@vesselwrks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Contact us!</a></p>
<br/><p>Q: I am an Investor. What is your revenue generation model?</p>
<p>A: We are so glad you asked! Contact us to talk nuts and bolts.</p>
<br/><p>Q: Where are these so called ""locations"" I keep hearing about?</p>
<p>A: Currently Vessel is on the ground in Manhattan at Spreadhouse Cafe. After two successful pilots in Brooklyn and Manhattan we are confident in our potential for expansion! Is there somewhere you want Vessel to be? <a href=""http://vesselwrks.com/locations2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Request a location here!</a></p>
<br/><p>Q: No but really.. how much does it cost?</p>
<p>A: Nothing! There is no charge to individuals to participate in the program! You will only be charged if you decide to keep the mug and therefore take it out of circulation for others. The current price of a missing mug is $15.</p>
<br/><p>Q: How long can I keep a Vessel mug for?</p>
<p>A: Once you register, and check out a Vessel mug you can keep it for 5 days before returning it at any of our locations.</p>
<br/><p>Q: What if I forget to return it?</p>
<p>A: Let’s be real. You’ll forget. You’ll go out of town and leave it sitting on your counter next to your succulents that you bought because your other plants died because you could never remember to water them. We understand. We have dead plants too. That’s why we give you a realistic return time and allow you to have two Vessel’s checked out at a time. If you decide to keep it forever you pay us $15. We will remind you when your due date is coming up, and days before you are ever charged.</p>
<br/><p>Q: Can I buy a Vessel mug?</p>
<p>A: We love them too! However, just like a library book, our Vessel's are meant to remain in the commons, for all to use and love.</p>
<br/><p>Q: Where do I return the mug?</p>
<p>A: Right now we have <a href=""http://vesselwrks.com/locations2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">four locations</a>, but are in the process of expansion!</p>
<br/><p>Q: I already bring my own cup so why should I even bother?</p>
<p>A: Yay! You’re already a change-maker extraordinaire. You obviously care about the impact your choices as a consumer/individual/lover/fighter make on the world around you! By signing up (for free!) you are helping us bring this free service to those people who might not be able to bring their own cup, or who might think it is too difficult. Help us to help you accomplish your already stellar goal of reducing waste.</p>
<br/><p>Q: You don't have them available in my area so why should I donate?</p>
<p>A: We want to be in your area! In fact we can’t WAIT to be in your area (*cough* neither can the whales *cough*) By signing up, and donating you are proving that there are individuals who don’t want to think disposably anymore, and want to be able to have Vessel’s circulating throughout their community. <a href=""http://vesselwrks.com/locations2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tell us where you want Vessel to be!</a></p>
<br/><p>Q: Yeah, sorry, I am not big into the environment... what’s in it for me?</p>
<p>A: Not everyone at Vessel likes the feel of grass between their toes and sunshine on their skin. In fact, some of us only get outside if we are trying to catch a Charizard in Pokemon Go. Getting your caffeine fix is easy with a paper cup, but it is just as easy with a Vessel, the only difference is that it keeps your drink at your preferred temperature and cuts back on the clean up fees (TAXES) that your city (TAXES) spends to haul off those paper cups (TAXES) and send them to a waste treatment plant (TAXES) and then haul them off to a landfill dumping site (TAXES).</p>
<br/><p>Q: This seems to good to be true, what’s the catch?</p>
<p>A: Vessel is currently in the third phase of our pilot launch. We are working out the kinks in our technology and our cafe implementation. We need your help to transition from pilot to full-scale, city-wide implementation.</p>

VESSEL EXISTS TO SOLVE A PROBLEM
THE PROBLEM




""But paper cups are... paper. Paper is natural. It biodegrades, it's basically like drinking out of an apple. Right?""

Because we know paper is made from trees we have this idea that it is somehow connected to the ecosystem in a very ""green"" way. We imagine these paper cups being made from something natural, and then just as seamlessly, absorbing back into the natural landscape once recycled. This idea that anything made out of paper can't really be bad for the environment because... it is the environment is intuitive but...
Well...


THE SOLUTION: Vessel
Vessel is the solution to the paper cup problem



Vessel is a FREE check-out system of stainless steel to-go mugs. The insulated mug keeps your drink hot or cold, and the silicone lid lets you travel across town without thinking about spills. We have pick up and drop off locations throughout the city, so whenever you are finished with your drink, instead of ditching it in a trashcan (and banishing it to a landfill) you can ditch it at a Vessel kiosk to be washed and then whenever you want another drink, a new, clean Vessel awaits at a nearby cafe. We handle the hassle, you sip in style.

A NETWORK OF MUGS
The lending system of Vessel is super simple. You pick up your cup at a cafe and drop it off when you're finished. But what makes Vessel special is the interconnectivity between each of our locations, which means picking up at one location and having the ability to drop it off at another. Pick up a Vessel in DUMBO, drop it off on the Lower East Side. Pick up a new one in Greenwich and drop it off in Midtown. 
We understand convenience is paramount. At Vessel we want to help you accomplish your goals, we just want to do it better than a paper cup ever has.
How It Works
1. Sign up in a cafe or online through vesselwrks.com.
Is your whole office interested? With our in-office sign up options, we come to you. All you have to do is ask.



2. Pick up your member card at a participating cafe to start using Vessel.


3. Order your beverage and request it be put in a Vessel mug.


4. Enjoy your beverage on the go in a Vessel that has been checked out to you!


5. Return your mug within 5 days to any of our participating locations and start over with a fresh one the next time you order a drink!



WHAT'S NEXT FOR VESSEL
We are using your pledge to grow Vessel in three specific areas.
1. More locations
Vessel has run pilot launches in 4 locations throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan, but in order to bring this service to everyone, we must first be accessible! Your pledge will give us the ability to add more pick-up and drop-off locations throughout the city, and the US.

Here are our current locations. Where to next? 

2. Quantified self delivery platform
(or ""What about an App?')
With our app we will provide real-time quantified self data to our members through a personalized user interface! We want to bring you your information, and we want to bring it to you fast. Along with getting stats on your coffee use, and social impact, you will also be able to see all of the Vessel locations in your area, how many mugs you have checked, when they are due back, and by adding a Family Plan functionality, we will make it easy for everyone to Vessel under one roof. Your pledge will help us get a move on implementing these types of technologies!
We want to make Vessel more accessible in all areas. What better way to gamify our system and give you real-time quantified self data? Apart from having one of our members following you around with a clipboard, documenting your every move and then reminding you of it all at the end of the day before you fall asleep.. there really is no better way to give you this information than through an app. Your pledge will help us build, generate, and roll out our Vessel app in order to turn this technological dream into a reality!

3. Different sizes
Vessel currently offers a 16 oz. stainless steel cup with a silicon lid. This allows users to  have their choice of a standard size “small medium large” amount of drink. In the future, however, we want users to be able to customize their cup to their drink. If you are getting a small coffee, you will be able to get it in a small Vessel. We want to grow our size beyond the standard 16 ounces as well, so if you're feeling particularly draggy from the night before, we want to be able to help you out. Your pledge will allow us to start rolling out these new sizes!

BREAKING DOWN ""QUANTIFIED-SELF""
You keep track of your steps, don't you want to keep track of how awesome you're being at diverting waste?
Vessel provides our users more than just a drink in a sexy cup.
We are a culture that is obsessed with quantifying our inputs and outputs. Tallying everything up and then reflecting on the big ideas of what it all means about us as an individual. At Vessel we want to provide you with all of the classic information about personal consumption, but we also want to show you all of the different ways that using Vessel has made an impact on areas we don't always think about when we order that bleary-eyed coffee. How much coffee did you drink this month? How much of it was Fair Trade? How did my Fair Trade purchases affect the people who made it? How many local coffee shops did I visit this month? How much waste did I divert from landfills? How many tax dollars did my waste diversion save? 
Vessel wants to give you this information.

Customers also gain access to information about the purchases they are making everyday. Pleasurable drinking experience + access to quantified-self information + lessening personal waste = WIN




Cafes WIN
The average cafe spends more money on your paper cup than it does on your coffee beans. Every time a Vessel is scanned out to a customer, the cafe pays Vessel half of what they would be spending on a paper cup. Vessel also alerts customers to Vessel-enabled cafes in their area, bringing new customers through the doors. All while improving corporate social responsibility. Save money + bring in new customers  + reduce waste + improve corporate social responsibility = WIN



Cities WIN
Vessel saves the taxpayer money. In NYC the city spends 3.2 million dollars a year burying paper cups. It is your tax dollars that are picking up the bill. Help lower those costs and lessen those growing piles in the landfill. Reduce taxes + reduce waste = WIN


WHAT ABOUT THE PERKS?
Warm Fuzzy's
We all have stuff. Lots and lots of stuff.  Did you know that, the average U.S. household has 300,000 items? We consume nearly twice as many material goods today as we did 50 years ago and these things, that we've started consuming at a faster rate than ever, end up in storage spaces (which have grown to an upwards of 50,000 in the US) – or in landfills.
This massive-scale stuff accruement is at the heart of what Vessel is trying to remedy.
For every $15 you spend, you replace 2,000 paper and plastic cups with one Vessel. That means for every $15 you spend, you remove 2,000 disposable cups from landfills. 
""Sponsor-A-Cup"" 
Along with the sheer joy that comes from knowing you had a hand in making a physical dent in a landfill, with your pledge you also gain access to our ""Sponsor-A-Cup"" program.


When you sponsor a cup, you can receive letters, photos and waste diversion information. This includes updates on where your cup is now, where it's been, and the impact it has been having on the community near and far! You can change a cup’s life from one of hardship and loneliness to one of hope and meaning. You have the opportunity to literally shift the way our culture thinks of disposability and reduce tons of waste – all while looking good!

FAQs
Q: I am a Cafe and I want this for my customers NOW!
A: We want this for your customers too! We are currently NYC based but are expanding. Contact us!
Q: I am an Investor. What is your revenue generation model?
A: We are so glad you asked! Contact us to talk nuts and bolts.
Q: Where are these so called ""locations"" I keep hearing about?
A: Currently Vessel is on the ground in Manhattan at Spreadhouse Cafe. After two successful pilots in Brooklyn and Manhattan we are confident in our potential for expansion! Is there somewhere you want Vessel to be? Request a location here!
Q: No but really.. how much does it cost?
A: Nothing! There is no charge to individuals to participate in the program! You will only be charged if you decide to keep the mug and therefore take it out of circulation for others. The current price of a missing mug is $15.
Q: How long can I keep a Vessel mug for?
A: Once you register, and check out a Vessel mug you can keep it for 5 days before returning it at any of our locations.
Q: What if I forget to return it?
A: Let’s be real. You’ll forget. You’ll go out of town and leave it sitting on your counter next to your succulents that you bought because your other plants died because you could never remember to water them. We understand. We have dead plants too. That’s why we give you a realistic return time and allow you to have two Vessel’s checked out at a time. If you decide to keep it forever you pay us $15. We will remind you when your due date is coming up, and days before you are ever charged.
Q: Can I buy a Vessel mug?
A: We love them too! However, just like a library book, our Vessel's are meant to remain in the commons, for all to use and love.
Q: Where do I return the mug?
A: Right now we have four locations, but are in the process of expansion!
Q: I already bring my own cup so why should I even bother?
A: Yay! You’re already a change-maker extraordinaire. You obviously care about the impact your choices as a consumer/individual/lover/fighter make on the world around you! By signing up (for free!) you are helping us bring this free service to those people who might not be able to bring their own cup, or who might think it is too difficult. Help us to help you accomplish your already stellar goal of reducing waste.
Q: You don't have them available in my area so why should I donate?
A: We want to be in your area! In fact we can’t WAIT to be in your area (*cough* neither can the whales *cough*) By signing up, and donating you are proving that there are individuals who don’t want to think disposably anymore, and want to be able to have Vessel’s circulating throughout their community. Tell us where you want Vessel to be!
Q: Yeah, sorry, I am not big into the environment... what’s in it for me?
A: Not everyone at Vessel likes the feel of grass between their toes and sunshine on their skin. In fact, some of us only get outside if we are trying to catch a Charizard in Pokemon Go. Getting your caffeine fix is easy with a paper cup, but it is just as easy with a Vessel, the only difference is that it keeps your drink at your preferred temperature and cuts back on the clean up fees (TAXES) that your city (TAXES) spends to haul off those paper cups (TAXES) and send them to a waste treatment plant (TAXES) and then haul them off to a landfill dumping site (TAXES).
Q: This seems to good to be true, what’s the catch?
A: Vessel is currently in the third phase of our pilot launch. We are working out the kinks in our technology and our cafe implementation. We need your help to transition from pilot to full-scale, city-wide implementation.",24.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story:</h3>
<p>As time goes on, virtual investment is becoming more popular and widely used. We realized that there is no better way to do investments than to invest in something you truly believe in because that's how investment works; it starts with 1) the initial belief that <i><strong>something</strong></i> is the best and 2) the initial step in having trust, faith, and love in that <i><strong>something</strong></i>. </p>
<p>What that <i><strong>something</strong></i> can be is...<b>A Better You.</b></p>
<p>At the end of the day, we all want to become better versions of ourselves, and we can do that by investing. When most of us think of the term ""investment,"" we might associate it with the words ""money"" and ""risky."" But we want to change this perception of ""investment"" from being seen as too risky to a step towards personal growth because <strong>A Better You </strong>is what you are investing in. The amount of risk and predictability is <u>determined by you</u>. After all, who can you trust more in the world other than yourself? </p>
<p>With Tryve, you are both <i>the </i><i><i>i</i>nvestor and the investment</i>. As long as you have <strong><i>1) the initial belief that you are your own best product/company </i></strong>and take <i><strong>2.) the initial step to have trust, faith, and love in yourself</strong>,</i><strong> </strong>your investment will be worthwhile and will prove to you that you are worth investing in, as there is no better investment than yourself in this world!</p>
<p>We provide a variety of categories you can improve in, ranging from emotional &amp; mental health, education, spirituality, fitness health, sleep, diet, sex, and much more areas that you can develop yourself and achieve your best state in.</p>
<p>You already know the kind of lifestyle, financial goals, and habits you want to harness. Tryve is just a tool and motivator to help you get to where you want to be in your life. It all comes down to you and how will you try, thrive, strive, and ""Tryve"" today.</p>
<p>So why not grow your own money and your own wellness at the same time? This is what Tryve was designed for you to do. You have nothing to lose as long as you are investing in <strong>A Better You</strong>.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Wool - Mini Mill in Iceland </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Producer</strong></p>
<p>My name is Hulda Brynjólfsdóttir.

Wool - Mini Mill in Iceland 
The Producer
My name is Hulda Brynjólfsdóttir. I live on a farm in South of Iceland.As well as farming with sheep and cattle, I am a handcrafter with a great love for everything made from wool.My dream is to run a mini mill on my farm and make yarn from my own wool, as well as from local farmer’s wool.I found a factory in Canada that makes machinery for small wool-mills. After looking very carefully into it, I and my family decided that starting our own business running a professional mini mill, will be the right next step for us.


What We Need & What You Get
The ProductThe goal is to produce high quality Icelandic yarn from our own wool and the wool being produced here in the area. This wool will be handled more carefully and respectfully and the yarn will be softer than what is available on the market now.It will be traceable back to the farm where it originates and you can be sure that all these animals are cared for in the best possible way.  I will make yarn in the natural colors of the Icelandic sheep, and also bats for those who want to spin yarn by hand on their spinning wheel.We believe that there is a huge and growing interest in good quality Icelandic made yarns straight from the farm – a market that currently is not supplied.We are planning to start production in October 2017.

Since January of 2018, we’ve carefully designed each item in our complete desk set. Working through countless design iterations and material choices, we put an emphasis on high-grade materials and a sleek feel. We’ve finally unveiled DESKAPE, a new all-in-one desk set with a premium look at an affordable price.Ultimately, we were able to find the perfect balance between intuitive usability and ultra-minimal design.     Each item in DESKAPE is made of high-grade billet aluminum and is designed to last a lifetime. We put our focus on sourcing the highest quality materials, using powerful aluminum extrusion to produce highest quality products.A cluttered desk is a cluttered mind. A chaotic workspace hurts your productivity and makes you feel unfocused and unorganized. It’s time to upgrade your boring old desk into a chic and modern workspace that brings you peace of mind every time you sit down.Not only will you feel great sitting at a clean desk, but our premium and uniquely designed organizers will be sure to impress clients and coworkers!                      We designed DESKAPE with Modern Architecture in mind. Each shape must be very purposeful and without extraneous features. Great design has been well-thought out. Each piece should perform its intended function.

<p>Ich bin dreifacher Papa, hab lange in der Gastronomie
gearbeitet und die Ausbildung zum Ernährungsberater nach der traditionell
chinesischen Medizin gemacht. Mein Samankocht - Mobil ermöglicht mir Kochen
nach den 5 Elementen in Bio-Qualität, dort und dann, wo meine Küche gebraucht
wird. Bio, regional, vor Ort und vegetarisch sind meine Beiträge zum Erhalt der
Natur für meine Kinder und Kindeskinder. Abgesehen davon brauch ich die Natur
beim Kochen: Draußen und in Bewegung spür ich den Wind, bin inspiriert. Ich
brauch auch die Flexibilität und Mobilität- Ich beweg mich gern.</p>
<p>Bitte hilf mir,
meinen Lebenstraum von Saman kocht zu verwirklichen und klicke auf den
""Spende-Link"" - In Euros nur mit Kreditkarte oder via <a href=""https://www.paypal.com/at/webapps/mpp/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paypal</a>. Mit dem Geld finanziere ich den Kauf des Bio-Mobils:
Ein umgebauter Ape-Kleinlaster mit eingebauter Küche – energieautark, wenn es
darauf ankommt! </p>
<p>Ich weiß, dass es eine Herausforderung ist, mit meinem kleinen Betrieb einen alternativen Weg zu gehen. Ich weiß auch, dass ich es schaffen kann, weil ich mir in meinem Leben nichts anderes Wünsche, weil es der einzige Weg ist, der mich glücklich macht. Es kommen jetzt bereits Anfragen herein und die Behörden haben das Samankocht – Mobil schon abgesegnet! Immer wieder koche ich in den letzten Monaten privat bei Seminaren/Festen von Freunden – das Feedback ist jedesmal so überwältigend, dass ich meinen Ohren kaum traue. Ich kann und will Samankocht leben – und das mobil, um die Menschen erreichen zu können, die meine Küche brauchen und schätzen.</p><p>Ich dank dir von
Herzen und schenk als Dank auch Saman kocht- TCM-Bio-Essen zurück- inklusive
Lieferung mit dem Samankocht-Mobil!</p>

<p>I am father of

according to the Traditional Chinese Medicine. My “Samankocht” Mobile Kitchen would
make it possible for me to cook according to the 5 Elements in bio-quality, right
on the spot, wherever and whenever my “Kitchen” is needed. Cooking organic,
regional, and vegetarian is my contribution to saving this planet for my
children and grandchildren. Aside from that, I need nature when cooking. Being outside,
moving and feeling a breeze, are of great inspiration to me. As I like to move,
flexibility and mobility are just what I need.</p>

Samankocht


Bio


5 Elemente


Vegetarisch


Mit Liebe


Mobil – mit deiner
     Hilfe!!



Ich bin dreifacher Papa, hab lange in der Gastronomie
gearbeitet und die Ausbildung zum Ernährungsberater nach der traditionell
chinesischen Medizin gemacht. Mein Samankocht - Mobil ermöglicht mir Kochen
nach den 5 Elementen in Bio-Qualität, dort und dann, wo meine Küche gebraucht
wird. Bio, regional, vor Ort und vegetarisch sind meine Beiträge zum Erhalt der
Natur für meine Kinder und Kindeskinder. Abgesehen davon brauch ich die Natur
beim Kochen: Draußen und in Bewegung spür ich den Wind, bin inspiriert. Ich
brauch auch die Flexibilität und Mobilität- Ich beweg mich gern.
Bitte hilf mir,
meinen Lebenstraum von Saman kocht zu verwirklichen und klicke auf den
""Spende-Link"" - In Euros nur mit Kreditkarte oder via Paypal. Mit dem Geld finanziere ich den Kauf des Bio-Mobils:
Ein umgebauter Ape-Kleinlaster mit eingebauter Küche – energieautark, wenn es
darauf ankommt! 
Ich weiß, dass es eine Herausforderung ist, mit meinem kleinen Betrieb einen alternativen Weg zu gehen. Ich weiß auch, dass ich es schaffen kann, weil ich mir in meinem Leben nichts anderes Wünsche, weil es der einzige Weg ist, der mich glücklich macht. Es kommen jetzt bereits Anfragen herein und die Behörden haben das Samankocht – Mobil schon abgesegnet! Immer wieder koche ich in den letzten Monaten privat bei Seminaren/Festen von Freunden – das Feedback ist jedesmal so überwältigend, dass ich meinen Ohren kaum traue. Ich kann und will Samankocht leben – und das mobil, um die Menschen erreichen zu können, die meine Küche brauchen und schätzen.Ich dank dir von
Herzen und schenk als Dank auch Saman kocht- TCM-Bio-Essen zurück- inklusive
Lieferung mit dem Samankocht-Mobil!

Ich bekomme mein Bio-Mobil und kann mich selbstständig

<h3 style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Update:</h3>
<h3 style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Our Progress With Only a Few Days Left:</h3>
<p>The Pocket 3D Printer takes two existing technologies, a robotic arm, and a 3D printing pen called the CreoPop, and simply combines them into the Pocket 3D Printer. The result is a fully portable 3D printer that has the advantages of standard 3D printers, but without the heat or smell! </p>
<p>With the funding received so far, I will be able to build the printers that have been ordered. However, my goal in reaching out to the crowdfunding community is not just to build 1, or 5, or even 50 Pocket 3D Printers. My end goal is to start a business researching, developing, and marketing, 3D Printers. <br/></p>
<p>3D printers have already changed the world, they can be used to print shoes, custom wood shop clamps, precise measuring cups for cooking, all at a very low cost.<br/></p>
<p>In this video, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqXlR4pfZvE&amp;app=desktop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watchv=YqXlR4pfZvE&amp;app=desktop</a>, Preeflow demonstrates one of the key concepts that will be used in the Pocket 3D Printer.  </p>
<p>Crowdfunding is a wonderful tool that can help anyone bring concepts to reality! Special thanks to the generous backers so far. With our current resources, we have been able to put together a prototype with a working armature shown in the pictures below. </p>

<h3><u>3D Printing is For You!</u></h3>
<div>
<p><span>You're riding to work on the train, listening to your favorite music on your phone. Suddenly, your phone slips out of your grasp and crashes to the floor, tumbling along the aisle. You quickly chase after it, only to find the case has cracked. You calmly sit back in your seat, pull out your Pocket 3D Printer from your bag, and print yourself a new case before you get to work.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Sound impossible? Not any more. The future of 3D printing is here - and it's portable!

<p>The Pocket 3D Printer lives up to it’s name. It collapses down to a pocket-size, easy-travel system no larger than an iPad Mini. No heat - The Pocket Printer prints using a photo-polymer resin. When the print is done, just grab it and go. No need to wait for a hot extruder to cool down. </p>
<p><b><u>SIMPLE TO USE!</u></b></p>
<p>The Pocket 3D Printer is also simple to use. You can download free files of predesigned models that are ready to print from sites like Thingiverse. Through the Pocket 3D Printer app, you can also download and print straight from your phone. The Pocket 3D Printer app also comes preloaded with it's own library of parts ready for you to print. You can also design your own parts with free design programs like Google Sketchup!</p>

<p>The Pocket 3D Printer prints layer by layer like a standard FDM plastic printer, except instead of heating up plastic, the Pocket Printer prints using a ultra violet photopolymer resin.

Our Progress With Only a Few Days Left:
The Pocket 3D Printer takes two existing technologies, a robotic arm, and a 3D printing pen called the CreoPop, and simply combines them into the Pocket 3D Printer. The result is a fully portable 3D printer that has the advantages of standard 3D printers, but without the heat or smell! 
With the funding received so far, I will be able to build the printers that have been ordered. However, my goal in reaching out to the crowdfunding community is not just to build 1, or 5, or even 50 Pocket 3D Printers. My end goal is to start a business researching, developing, and marketing, 3D Printers. 
3D printers have already changed the world, they can be used to print shoes, custom wood shop clamps, precise measuring cups for cooking, all at a very low cost.
In this video, https://www.youtube.com/watchv=YqXlR4pfZvE&app=desktop, Preeflow demonstrates one of the key concepts that will be used in the Pocket 3D Printer.  
Crowdfunding is a wonderful tool that can help anyone bring concepts to reality! Special thanks to the generous backers so far. With our current resources, we have been able to put together a prototype with a working armature shown in the pictures below.

  Builder is a new Integrated Development Environment I'm developing to make it easier to write software for Linux.
  By simplifying the development process, I hope to increase the number of people who can contribute to our platform.
  To do this, I need your support so that I can work on Builder full time.
  I'm asking for $30,000 to cover my costs for the next 3-5 months while I implement Builder's core features.
</p>
<p>
  Over the last few of years, I've worked with people trying to get started developing for Linux.
  Almost universally, I found that getting started was the single hardest problem.
  I want builder to be the easiest way to get started.
</p>
<p>
  I've worked on virtual machines, databases, graphics tool-kits, compiler tools, and programming languages. I think that puts me in a unique position to be successful in a project as large and complicated as an IDE.
  I hope you'll agree and contribute to my campaign.

<h2>Planned Features</h2>
<table cellspacing=""10"">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style=""width: 50%; vertical-align: top; font-size: 0.9em;"">
<h3>Project Management
</h3>
<p style="""">
        Builder is designed to manage your autotools based project. We
        manage the complex bits so you don't have to. Focus time more on
        writing your application and less time on build system rules.
      </p>
<div>
<h3>Asset Catalog
</h3>
<p style="""">
          To simplify the management of user interface templates, icons,
          setting schemas, CSS styling, and embedded files, we've included a
          built in asset manager. Just navigate to your project details to
          see more.
        
      </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>API Exploration
</h3>
<p style="""">
          Learning new APIs can be a time consuming process. To save you
          time we've added support for navigating types from right within
          the source code editor. You can jump to a type declaration with
          just a click.
        </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Split Views</h3>
<p style="""">
          With Builder you can place content where you want it. Multiple
          editors side by side is no problem. You can even place
          documentation next to code so you don't have to keep switching
          contexts.
        </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Jump to Symbol
</h3>
<p style="""">
          Navigating large files can be difficult. So Builder includes
          everything you need to jump around your source code whether it's
          within the same file, or somewhere else in your source tree.
        </p>
</div>
<h3>Global Search
</h3>
<p style="""">
        At the top of Builder is the Global Search bar. You can use this
        to jump between files, open new files, locate symbols, search
        documentation and more.
      </p>
<div>
<h3>Glade Built In
</h3>
<p style="""">
          By integrating Glade, Builder simplifies creating new Gtk+
          widgets with templates, embedded icon themes, CSS, and more.
          Jump between the designer and code in an instant.
        </p>
</div>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p style="""">
        Browse the comprehensive documentation provided with the libraries
        you use most. If you don't find what you are looking for or don't
        understand it, you can flag the documentation for improvement by
        the GNOME developers.
      </p>
<h3>Quick Help
</h3>
<p style="""">
        When auto completion is enabled we'll provide you documentation right
        at your fingertips as you type. No more jumping between documentation
        and code to see what that parameter means.
      </p>
<h3>Global Navigation</h3>
<p style="""">
        To make it easier to jump back to what you were just doing we've
        added Global Navigation. It works just like your web browser. We
        keep track of where you are in the IDE and you can move freely
        backwards and forwards.
      </p>
<h3>IDE Scripting<sup><a href=""#Milestone_4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">4</a></sup>
</h3>
<p style="""">
        You can optimize your workflow with the scripting
        capabilities provided by GObject Introspection and GJS. You'll have
        access to all the APIs inside of Builder to make it do exactly what
        you want.
      </p>

<h3>GNOME Simulator<sup><a href=""#Milestone_9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">9</a></sup>
</h3>
<p style="""">
          Builder provides a simulator allowing you to test your application
          on multiple versions of GNOME. The SDK is provided by OSTree and
          GNOME Continuous. You can test against released versions of GNOME
          as well as stay up to date with the development version in Git.
        </p>
</div>
<h3>Connect Hardware Devices<sup><a href=""#Milestone_5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">5</a></sup>
</h3>
<p style="""">
        If you have a GNOME powered tablet, phone, or development board you
        can connect it to Builder to run and debug applications remotely.
        Sit back and debug from your workstation while you run the
        application interactively on your tablet.
      </p>
<h3>Collaborative Editing<sup><a href=""#Milestone_7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">7</a></sup>
</h3>
<p style="""">
        Sometimes you just need an extra eye. Or maybe you need some code
        review? Our collaborative editor feature built upon libinifity will
        allow you and a teammate to solve that problem together just as if
        you had two keyboards at the same computer.
      </p>
<h3>Compilers</h3>
<p style="""">
        Builder uses the two most common compilers on the market today.
        Code navigation and analysis features are provided by clang and
        built with GCC.
      </p>
<div>
<h3>Graphical Debugger<sup><a href=""#Milestone_5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">5</a></sup>
</h3>
<p style="""">
          Nobody wishes to debug, but when it's needed you want a solid
          debugger on your side. Builder integrates Nemiver, the GDB
          frontend to help you track threads, variables, breakpoints,
          watchpoints and more. You can even view and edit memory directly
          using the hex editor.
        </p>
</div>
<h3>Leak Detection<sup><a href=""#Milestone_7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">7</a></sup>
</h3>
<p style="""">
        Builder will help you find leaks in your applications using the
        GObject runtime statistics. Additionally, more powerful tools like
        valgrind will help you narrow that leak to the exact line of code.
      </p>
<h3>Code Search<sup><a href=""#Milestone_9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">9</a></sup>
</h3>
<p style="""">
        When documentation is short it can help to look at other examples
        of code in the GNOME repositories. Our code search feature will help
        you find uses of GNOME APIs throughout code hosted on git.gnome.org.
      </p>
<h3>Track Issues<sup><a href=""#Milestone_10"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">10</a></sup>
</h3>
<p style="""">
        Browsing and searching Bugzilla can be a chore. So we'll cache the
        bug information for your project locally so you can check that bug
        report quickly without leaving the IDE. Using
        <span style=""font-family: monospace;"">git-bz</span>
        we can even attach patches and close bugs on your behalf.
      </p>
</td>
<td style=""width: 50%; vertical-align: top; font-size: 0.9em;"">
<div>
<h3>Auto Completion<sup><a href=""#Milestone_6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">6</a></sup>
</h3>
<p style="""">
          The Clang compiler toolchain provides you with a robust auto completion engine for C and C++.
          No matter where you are in your source code, you can determine what is possible with just a press of a key.
          We will add auto completion support for Python and Vala if we reach our fundraising target.
        </p>
</div>
<h3>Auto Indentation</h3>
<p style="""">
        Nobody wants to spend all of their time formatting code. Builder
        will attempt to format the code for you as you type leaving you
        to focus on the important part. We currently support C, Python,
        and XML with more languages on the way.
      </p>
<h3>Powerful Snippets</h3>
<p style="""">
        The Builder team knows how powerful snippets can be in the daily
        tasks of a developer. We built the snippet system we always wanted,
        and now it's yours too! You can have multiple tab stops, linked
        entry points, and dynamic content. Snippets within snippets?
        No problem!
      </p>
<h3>Tutorials<sup><a href=""#Milestone_4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">4</a></sup>
</h3>
<p style="""">
        Builder comes with a set of tutorials to help you get started with
        GNOME and Builder. Start by creating your first Gtk+ application.
      </p>
<h3>Quick Open
</h3>
<p style="""">
        Open any file in your project quickly using the Global Search bar.
        Just start typing a few distinctive characters of the files name
        and press Enter.
      </p>
<h3>Markdown and HTML Preview
</h3>
<p style="""">
        Editing markdown and HTML can be frustrating when you are constantly
        switching between code and preview. So Builder includes a live preview
        right in the IDE to save you time and patience.
      </p>
<div>
<h3>Live Issues</h3>
<p style="""">
          Tired of switching back and forth to a terminal to compile your
          code just to get the line number of the error? Save time with
          errors shown right as you type them.
        </p>
</div>
<h3>Fix-It!
</h3>
<p style="""">
        If the compiler knows how to fix an issue that is preventing your
        program from compiling, simply click the Fix-It! button to fix the
        error rather than solving it yourself.
      </p>

<h3>Version Tracking
</h3>
<p style="""">
          Git has won the version control wars and so we natuarly chose it
          as our SCM of choice in GNOME. We bring the power of Git to you
          in a simple and easy to understand way. You can create branches,
          commit, push, pull, and more.
        </p>
</div>
<h3>Snapshots
</h3>
<p style="""">
        Ever wanted to try that crazy new idea without risking your project?
        Builder includes a snapshoting to save your project so that if you
        break something you can easily rollback to where you were.
      </p>
<div>
<h3>JavaScript<sup><a href=""#Milestone_4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">4</a></sup>
</h3>
<p style="""">
          You can write applications using JavaScript and deploy them just
          like they were a natively compiled language. Builder will bundle
          all of your resources together and bootstrap the JavaScript runtime
          for you. Just choose JavaScript for your next project.
        </p>

<p style="""">
        If you ever need to get at the internals of Builder while it is running
        you can use the Firefox-inspired command bar. You can even execute
        commands internal to builder exposed via GAction.
      </p>
<h3>D-Bus<sup><a href=""#Milestone_4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">4</a></sup>
</h3>
<p style="""">
        Creating and consuming D-Bus services can be a daunting task for those
        new to the platform. So we've created all the tools you need to
        create your own or connect to an existing service. Just browse to
        the service installed on your system and click to add it to your project.

<h1>Community Support</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>These days, an operating system is as good as the application ecosystem around it; Builder enriches the GNOME platform with a simple yet powerful developer workflow, designed to maximize productivity and to make it as easy as possible to turn an idea into a beautiful, integrated application. I'm personally thrilled by the opportunities this project will open up in our community.</p>
<p>Cosimo Cecchi</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Free/libre software lives in an interesting but precarious place,
where it is moot to charge for the actual software, but development
still costs time and money.  I am extremely happy that Christian
took the plunge to stop being an unpaid volunteer and turn himself
into a crowdfunded toolmaker.  High-quality, pleasant tools are hard
to find, and Builder is an excellent opportunity to make it possible
for more people to develop beautiful software for GNOME.  Support the
development of Builder and help improve free software for everyone!</p>

  By simplifying the development process, I hope to increase the number of people who can contribute to our platform.
  To do this, I need your support so that I can work on Builder full time.
  I'm asking for $30,000 to cover my costs for the next 3-5 months while I implement Builder's core features.


  Over the last few of years, I've worked with people trying to get started developing for Linux.
  Almost universally, I found that getting started was the single hardest problem.
  I want builder to be the easiest way to get started.


  I've worked on virtual machines, databases, graphics tool-kits, compiler tools, and programming languages. I think that puts me in a unique position to be successful in a project as large and complicated as an IDE.
  I hope you'll agree and contribute to my campaign.





Planned Features




Project Management


        Builder is designed to manage your autotools based project. We
        manage the complex bits so you don't have to. Focus time more on
        writing your application and less time on build system rules.
      

Asset Catalog


          To simplify the management of user interface templates, icons,
          setting schemas, CSS styling, and embedded files, we've included a
          built in asset manager. Just navigate to your project details to
          see more.
        
      


API Exploration


          Learning new APIs can be a time consuming process. To save you
          time we've added support for navigating types from right within
          the source code editor. You can jump to a type declaration with
          just a click.
        


Split Views

          With Builder you can place content where you want it. Multiple
          editors side by side is no problem. You can even place
          documentation next to code so you don't have to keep switching
          contexts.
        


Jump to Symbol


          Navigating large files can be difficult. So Builder includes
          everything you need to jump around your source code whether it's
          within the same file, or somewhere else in your source tree.
        

Global Search


        At the top of Builder is the Global Search bar. You can use this
        to jump between files, open new files, locate symbols, search
        documentation and more.
      

Glade Built In


          By integrating Glade, Builder simplifies creating new Gtk+
          widgets with templates, embedded icon themes, CSS, and more.
          Jump between the designer and code in an instant.
        

Documentation

        Browse the comprehensive documentation provided with the libraries
        you use most. If you don't find what you are looking for or don't
        understand it, you can flag the documentation for improvement by
        the GNOME developers.
      
Quick Help


        When auto completion is enabled we'll provide you documentation right
        at your fingertips as you type. No more jumping between documentation
        and code to see what that parameter means.
      
Global Navigation

        To make it easier to jump back to what you were just doing we've
        added Global Navigation. It works just like your web browser. We
        keep track of where you are in the IDE and you can move freely
        backwards and forwards.
      
IDE Scripting4


        You can optimize your workflow with the scripting
        capabilities provided by GObject Introspection and GJS. You'll have
        access to all the APIs inside of Builder to make it do exactly what
        you want.
      


GNOME Simulator9


          Builder provides a simulator allowing you to test your application
          on multiple versions of GNOME. The SDK is provided by OSTree and
          GNOME Continuous. You can test against released versions of GNOME
          as well as stay up to date with the development version in Git.
        

Connect Hardware Devices5


        If you have a GNOME powered tablet, phone, or development board you
        can connect it to Builder to run and debug applications remotely.
        Sit back and debug from your workstation while you run the
        application interactively on your tablet.
      
Collaborative Editing7


        Sometimes you just need an extra eye. Or maybe you need some code
        review? Our collaborative editor feature built upon libinifity will
        allow you and a teammate to solve that problem together just as if
        you had two keyboards at the same computer.
      
Compilers

        Builder uses the two most common compilers on the market today.
        Code navigation and analysis features are provided by clang and
        built with GCC.
      

Graphical Debugger5


          Nobody wishes to debug, but when it's needed you want a solid
          debugger on your side. Builder integrates Nemiver, the GDB
          frontend to help you track threads, variables, breakpoints,
          watchpoints and more. You can even view and edit memory directly
          using the hex editor.
        

Leak Detection7


        Builder will help you find leaks in your applications using the
        GObject runtime statistics. Additionally, more powerful tools like
        valgrind will help you narrow that leak to the exact line of code.
      
Code Search9


        When documentation is short it can help to look at other examples
        of code in the GNOME repositories. Our code search feature will help
        you find uses of GNOME APIs throughout code hosted on git.gnome.org.
      
Track Issues10


        Browsing and searching Bugzilla can be a chore. So we'll cache the
        bug information for your project locally so you can check that bug
        report quickly without leaving the IDE. Using
        git-bz
        we can even attach patches and close bugs on your behalf.
      



Auto Completion6


          The Clang compiler toolchain provides you with a robust auto completion engine for C and C++.
          No matter where you are in your source code, you can determine what is possible with just a press of a key.
          We will add auto completion support for Python and Vala if we reach our fundraising target.
        

Auto Indentation

        Nobody wants to spend all of their time formatting code. Builder
        will attempt to format the code for you as you type leaving you
        to focus on the important part. We currently support C, Python,
        and XML with more languages on the way.
      
Powerful Snippets

        The Builder team knows how powerful snippets can be in the daily
        tasks of a developer. We built the snippet system we always wanted,
        and now it's yours too! You can have multiple tab stops, linked
        entry points, and dynamic content. Snippets within snippets?
        No problem!
      
Tutorials4


        Builder comes with a set of tutorials to help you get started with
        GNOME and Builder. Start by creating your first Gtk+ application.
      
Quick Open


        Open any file in your project quickly using the Global Search bar.
        Just start typing a few distinctive characters of the files name
        and press Enter.
      
Markdown and HTML Preview


        Editing markdown and HTML can be frustrating when you are constantly
        switching between code and preview. So Builder includes a live preview
        right in the IDE to save you time and patience.
      

Live Issues

          Tired of switching back and forth to a terminal to compile your
          code just to get the line number of the error? Save time with
          errors shown right as you type them.
        

Fix-It!


        If the compiler knows how to fix an issue that is preventing your
        program from compiling, simply click the Fix-It! button to fix the
        error rather than solving it yourself.
      


Version Tracking


          Git has won the version control wars and so we natuarly chose it
          as our SCM of choice in GNOME. We bring the power of Git to you
          in a simple and easy to understand way. You can create branches,
          commit, push, pull, and more.
        

Snapshots


        Ever wanted to try that crazy new idea without risking your project?
        Builder includes a snapshoting to save your project so that if you
        break something you can easily rollback to where you were.
      

JavaScript4


          You can write applications using JavaScript and deploy them just
          like they were a natively compiled language. Builder will bundle
          all of your resources together and bootstrap the JavaScript runtime
          for you. Just choose JavaScript for your next project.
        


Python6



          Love Python? We do too. So we added support for Python right into
          Builder. You have auto indentation and auto completion right at
          your fingertips. Get all the benefits of the project management
          features found in C and C++ projects like settings, CSS, UI
          templates and more.
        

Powerful VIM-style Editing

        Longstanding VIM users know firsthand the power of a modal editor.
        Our developers don't want you to feel left out so we created a robust
        VIM engine within Builder to help you feel at home. ""ll^[Ihe^[Ao"" to you too buddy!
      
Command Bar


        If you ever need to get at the internals of Builder while it is running
        you can use the Firefox-inspired command bar. You can even execute
        commands internal to builder exposed via GAction.
      
D-Bus4


        Creating and consuming D-Bus services can be a daunting task for those
        new to the platform. So we've created all the tools you need to
        create your own or connect to an existing service. Just browse to
        the service installed on your system and click to add it to your project.
      
Unit Testing7


        The industry aggress that tests are important for the long term
        stability of your project. Wouldn't it be nice to see how your project
        has performed over time? We'll track those unit test results and store
        them in git-notes so
        you can graph them later.
      


GNOME Shell Extensions10


          Create and test your shell extension without breaking your running GNOME session!
          You can create a new GNOME shell extension and test it from within the simulator.
          That means you can test it against multiple GNOME versions including what is currently under development from Git.

Community Support

These days, an operating system is as good as the application ecosystem around it; Builder enriches the GNOME platform with a simple yet powerful developer workflow, designed to maximize productivity and to make it as easy as possible to turn an idea into a beautiful, integrated application. I'm personally thrilled by the opportunities this project will open up in our community.
Cosimo Cecchi


Free/libre software lives in an interesting but precarious place,
where it is moot to charge for the actual software, but development
still costs time and money.  I am extremely happy that Christian
took the plunge to stop being an unpaid volunteer and turn himself
into a crowdfunded toolmaker.  High-quality, pleasant tools are hard
to find, and Builder is an excellent opportunity to make it possible
for more people to develop beautiful software for GNOME.  Support the
development of Builder and help improve free software for everyone!
Federico Mena Quintero

Stretch Goals
If we reach our goal, we'll be able to complete the third milestone of Builder. Each tier afterwards helps us reach additional milestones. The more that we raise, the longer I can focus my life and energy on Builder.

$40,000 - Milestone 4

If we reach $40,000, we'll have enough to reach the fourth milestone of Builder. This includes IDE scripting, JavaScript applications, and tight D-Bus integration. These are needed as a foundation for further milestones.

$50,000 - Milestone 5

If we reach $50,000, we'll have enough funds to reach the fifth milestone of Builder. This includes a graphical debugger and integration with external hardware such as tablets and ARM-based hardware devices.

$60,000 - Milestone 6

If we reach $60,000, we'll have enough funds to reach the sixth milestone of Builder. This includes support for writing GNOME applications in both Python and Vala.

$75,000 - Milestone 7

If we reach $75,000, we'll have enough funds to reach the seventh milestone of Builder. This includes support for unit testing, application leak detection, split views within a single document and collaborative editing features.

$90,000 - Milestone 8

If we reach $90,000, we'll have enough funds to reach the eighth milestone of Builder. This includes the addition of a GNOME simulator to help developers test their application in multiple versions of a pristine GNOME experience. Additionally, we'll add server side support to GNOMEs infrastructure for a robust code search that can be accessed from the IDE.


$100,000 - Milestone 9

If we reach $100,000, we'll have enough funds to reach the ninth milestone of Builder. This will add support for writing GNOME Shell Extensions within the IDE. You'll be able to test them inside of the GNOME simulator to ensure that you don't break your currently running GNOME environment. Additionally, we'll add support for bugzilla issue tracking right in the IDE.
Alternative Payment
We understand that credit cards aren't for everyone. If you cannot or do
not want to pay by credit card, eCheck, or paypal, contact christian@hergert.me to make alternate arrangements.

To thank you for your support we will gladly reward you with delicious jams, syrups and spreads made with love, from local fruit.  We are also offering pin-back buttons and totes so that you can show your love for the project and carry your fruit!  All rewards will be available for pick-up at Santropol Roulant, 111 Roy street east (Monday-Saturday 9:30am to 5:30 pm) from December 10th to 24th.  Perfect timing for holiday gifts.  If you are unable to pick up your reward in Montreal, we can mail it to you within Canada, we just ask that you add a little extra to cover the cost of shipping.

  The Impact Your donation helps us provide Montrealers with greater access to healthy, local, affordable fruit.  We are building ties within our communities and growing knowledge the varieties of fruit that are suited to our climate. We are offering alternatives to commercially produced fruit which often travels over long distances, arriving past peak freshness.  
  Many ways to help us!

Regardless of your budget, you can help us by sharing this campaign with friends and family via email, Facebook, Indiegogo's share tools and twitter. 
Send an email to Simon (info@lesfruitsdefendus.org) if you have any questions, we would love to hear from you.

<p>You can spin them, whirl them, do tricks, stick them to surfaces, play games with friends… the possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>Other fidgets or gadgets have specific purposes and uses.<span> FinGears are completely modular and free-style. </span></p>

<p>Our rings come in three types of boxes by size: <span>small (green box), medium (orange box) and large (blue box).</span></p>
<p> <span>Small rings</span> are designed for a finger diameter of 16mm (approx. 0.6 inches).</p>
<p><span>Medium rings</span> are designed for a finger diameter of 18mm (approx. 0.7 inches).</p>
<p><span>Large</span> <span>rings</span> are designed for a finger diameter of 21mm (approx. 0.8 inches).</p>
<p><span>Each box has a highlighted finger shape</span> that's 1mm larger than the appropriate finger size. You can use it to fit your index finger inside the shape for an approximate idea for your ring size.</p>
<p>We developed <span>a print-out</span> <span>PDF to measure your finger</span> <span>size</span> <span>before you get the box too.</span> This way, you can see with your own eyes which ring sizes are best for you.</p>
<p><span>You can download the PDF file here:</span> <a href=""https://bit.ly/34DUIR6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://bit.ly/34DUIR6 </a></p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>As with any physical product, the challenges are related to the manufacturing and delivery of the goods. As to our manufacturing capabilities: we have already created not only the prototypes, but also the final versions of the rings, fine-tuned the materials and are ready to go with our production. All we need is the support of the awesome Kickstarter community to push the ""launch button"", as it were. We have the product, we have the magnetic awesomeness, all we need are our backers! We have experience in producing various models in a variety of materials, we have great engineers and designers and we're confident we can deliver an awesome product. In regards to delivery, we have the support of experienced logistics specialists that have already shipped many types of products worldwide, from the U.S. to Europe, to Asia. While delays in shipping are always possible (and it's not something we have complete control over), we are also confident we will deliver all the items to our backers. Overall, our team is really passionate about bringing these amazing Magnetic Rings to you, to share our own joy and fun around the globe!</p>

MEDIA about FinGears :
A hands-on review of FinGears rings from Paul, the Friendly Reviewer!
 
 Hands-on experience from Magnetic Games:
 
German review of FinGears from Gadget-Rausch :
 
""Spinners are a thing of the past with the coming of FinGears. The magnetic rings should not only calm the nerves, but also improve your skill and dexterity.
If you are looking for an addiction-free way to calm yourself in stressful situations , you can support FinGears on Kickstarter .""
 
 ""...Rather than simply ‘spinning your spinner’, FinGears allows you to play a wide array of games and try awesome tricks. And if you’re content with spinning, the non-concentric nature of the FinGears offers unlimited spinning possibilities.""


 FinGears are magnetic free-style rings unlike any other fidget or stress relief gadget. 
You can spin them, whirl them, do tricks, stick them to surfaces, play games with friends… the possibilities are endless!
Other fidgets or gadgets have specific purposes and uses. FinGears are completely modular and free-style. 
 We created a streamlined, universal design of snappy magnets encased in colorful vibrant rings with multi-directional spin. Our goal was to make something that has more creative freedom for the user than anything else! And we're sure we succeeded!  

 Here's our own experience, as users:  We've invented tricks for them, played ""billiards"" and ""air hockey"", stuck them to whiteboards to imitate retro pinball.
We used them to focus our thoughts and unwind to the snappy rhythm after a long day. 
 We've had. So. Much. Fun.
 So, we want to share our excitement with you! 
  
 Planetary Orbit trick

 We invented some tricks during our own experimentation. Some were created by our engineers, some - by friends, some - by our office crew. We're completely sure the community can create much more. We've only just begun! 
 Eclipse trick

 Axis Blade trick

 The Katana trick
 
 Magnetic Split trick

 Tower Spin trick

 Figure Eight trick

Additional MOVES, GAMES and TRICKS from reviewers and testers:







You can also check out our more detailed trick tutorial with our most experienced FinGears user - Denis.  Can you think of more ideas for tricks? Let us know and we'll make updates for the trick library!  
  
Track game - make your own racing course and avoid the magnetic fields!
 The beauty of FinGears as a fidget / gadget is that you can invent so many uses for them! Just through the natural property of magnets and the sleek spinning ring elements, you can create games and fun shapes with them.
 It's a cooperative experience that unites people (and we're not just saying that, our entire office is now full of people doing stuff with the rings together!).
Magnetic Billiards - see what moves you can achieve without magnetizing your ring.  

 The easiest game - Magnetic Hockey. Avoid the magnetic field as you send the ring back and forth! 

Check out our detailed video on the basic games we developed. Let us know YOUR OWN new ideas on what  games can be created! 
 
 Our first backers will receive a serious discount from both the Kickstarter and market price as a special thanks for supporting us!
Backers that aren't in time for the early-bird prices will still receive a great deal compared to future possible market price, especially considering we will ship FREE worldwide!
The more boxes of FinGears you purchase per pledge, the more you save. Share the fun with friends, give a TRULY original gift, build awesome shapes and games, scale them to your imagination! 

Our rings come in three types of boxes by size: small (green box), medium (orange box) and large (blue box).
 Small rings are designed for a finger diameter of 16mm (approx. 0.6 inches).
Medium rings are designed for a finger diameter of 18mm (approx. 0.7 inches).
Large rings are designed for a finger diameter of 21mm (approx. 0.8 inches).
Each box has a highlighted finger shape that's 1mm larger than the appropriate finger size. You can use it to fit your index finger inside the shape for an approximate idea for your ring size.
We developed a print-out PDF to measure your finger size before you get the box too. This way, you can see with your own eyes which ring sizes are best for you.
You can download the PDF file here: https://bit.ly/34DUIR6 
Print on standard A4 paper. Make sure you select the ""actual size"" option when printing (or similar wording, based on your software) so it keeps the correct dimensions and doesn't change the borders. Please note that it's not the most exact of measuring processes due to different printers, software, paper etc. But it should give you a general idea!

  Our initial launch will include 8 color combinations:

Orange (main color) - blue (inner line)
Blue (main color) - orange (inner line)
Green (main color) - black (inner line)
Black (main color) - green (inner line)
Blue (main color) - black (inner line)
Black (main color) - blue (inner line)
Orange (main color) - black (inner line)
Black (main color) - orange (inner line)

We plan to expand our color line-up in the future, adding purple, other colors (and possibly other materials and elements!) as we expand our production and shipping capabilities.
Due to initial launch constraints, each box will have a single color COMBINATION (for example - three rings in Blue-orange or three rings in Green-black). However, we've found it quite cool to have more than one box: mix different sizes and colors to scale the games and tricks!

IMPORTANT: You will be able to choose your size and color combination through our pledge management addon once the campaign finishes.
 

While the result is elegant and intuitive, we've had a long road to developing the perfect shape, geometry, rotation methods, magnet placements and more.
We started out from just the idea of magnetic gears you can rotate and stick together into shapes. We moved from wood to plastic (for colors), and then had a lightning flash of an idea... make the rings easy to whirl, manipulate, carry, spin.

<p>iPad Pro is the most powerful and useful tablet available today. However, it remains limited by its virtual keyboard, which takes up half of the display and makes typing for long periods of time problematic.</p>
<p>Recently, Apple created an entirely separate operating system: “iPad OS” for iPad which allows it to operate more like a MacBook. One of the great features of iPad OS is mouse support, which greatly boosts the iPad’s productivity potential when used with an external keyboard… </p>
<p>So we created Libra, a Bluetooth keyboard with trackpad, backlighting, and function keys to provide a user experience like a MacBook, without sacrificing the advantages of a tablet. Libra maximizes your iPad productivity while at home or on-the-go. Libra is compatible with iPad Pro 9.7"", 10.5"", 11"" and 12.9"".</p>

<ul><li> <strong>MacBook-style Design</strong> </li></ul>
<p>Libra’s sleek aluminum housing perfectly captures Apple’s aesthetic and matches with the iPad Pro with colors of space gray and silver. It’s the perfect complement to the iPad Pro and when combined, looks similar to a full-size MacBook.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573212082/fataiai8u6awfeeml9uv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul><li> <strong>Trackpad for iPad Pro</strong> </li></ul>
<p>Libra is the world’s first iPad keyboard with a built-in trackpad, bringing you MacBook-like gesture and touch control.

Recently, Apple created an entirely separate operating system: “iPad OS” for iPad which allows it to operate more like a MacBook. One of the great features of iPad OS is mouse support, which greatly boosts the iPad’s productivity potential when used with an external keyboard… 
So we created Libra, a Bluetooth keyboard with trackpad, backlighting, and function keys to provide a user experience like a MacBook, without sacrificing the advantages of a tablet. Libra maximizes your iPad productivity while at home or on-the-go. Libra is compatible with iPad Pro 9.7"", 10.5"", 11"" and 12.9"".

 MacBook-style Design 
Libra’s sleek aluminum housing perfectly captures Apple’s aesthetic and matches with the iPad Pro with colors of space gray and silver. It’s the perfect complement to the iPad Pro and when combined, looks similar to a full-size MacBook.
 Trackpad for iPad Pro 
Libra is the world’s first iPad keyboard with a built-in trackpad, bringing you MacBook-like gesture and touch control. With the mouse support feature in the iPad OS, iPad Pro rivals the usability of a laptop now. (*More gesture control features will be added after the iPad OS released) 
Function Keys 
Like a laptop, a dedicated row of function keys makes adjusting the iPad's volume and screen brightness a quick tap away. There are also shortcuts to perform other tasks such as switching the typing language, copy/paste, and more which makes typing and getting work done more efficiently. 
 
Adjustable Backlit Keys 
The keyboard has backlit keys with three levels of brightness which makes the keyboard easier to use at night. The color and effect of the backlight are adjustable to create the perfect look. 
 

 
 
The keys are the same shape and size as the ones on Apple's last-generation MacBook Pro. Featuring the scissor-switch structure that makes typing on a MacBook so satisfying, Libra delivers the perfect tactile, responsive, and quiet typing experience. 

 
 
 Magnetic Cover for 12.9-inch iPad Pro 
We consider device protection essential and with that in mind, Libra comes with a snap-on magnetic cover that can protect your iPad Pro from scratches and dents. 
 
Unique Case for 9.7, 10.5, and 11-inch iPad Pro
We provide a special case for 11-inch iPad Pro only and make the iPad Pro perfectly fit the Libra keyboard. It can fully cover your iPad Pro and protect it from crashing. Four colors of the case are available: space gray, red, green and blue. We're offering the case for 9.7"" iPad Pro (2nd.gen) and 10.5"" iPad Pro(2nd.gen) now which will be made in the mass production phase.

Getting started with Libra is easy. After a simple initial Bluetooth connection set up, Libra will pair with your iPad Pro automatically whenever you turn on the keyboard. A seamless, reliable, Bluetooth 5.1 connection is always ready.

<p><strong>The startups  &amp; Small Businesses challenge</strong></p>
<p>You face a unique set of challenges as a start-up or a small business. Chief among these challenges, however, is money. Money: you need plenty of it just to get started, and if you want to keep your doors open, you need to start making more than you are spending <i>very quickly</i>. If this sounds like a difficult proposition, that is because it is. It is so difficult, in fact, that the vast majority of start-ups never make it past their first year of business. This is bad news for everyone, from the investors to the customers who could have benefited from whatever product the company was making.</p>
<p><strong>Our Solution</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a solution. In order to cut one major cost – software licenses and subscriptions– our team has developed Appy, the ultimate all-on-one inbound marketing and management software package. Appy has been engineered for ease of use, effective security, flexibility, multilingualism, and power, replacing a number of programs that start-ups otherwise spend thousands of dollars purchasing. With Appy, you can track all the activity in your business: warehouse stock, sales orders, CRM, eCommerce, statistics, payments, quotes, and much more.</p>

3. Engaging Users Early and Often in the Project.Users will tend to describe what they’re already used to, rather than what they really need. Small but loud minorities of users may skew the results by raising more concern about a particular issue than is warranted.

Other Ways You Can Help
Beyond making a monetary contribution, you can help us by sharing our campaign with all your friends and family on Facebook and Twitter and all your colleagues on LinkedIn. The more entrepreneurs know about Appy by the time we are ready to launch, the smoother our introduction will go.
We appreciate your support greatly.

<p>LinkedIn is the largest business network in the world. Its publishing platform – Pulse is becoming more and more popular among managers, executives, entrepreneurs, marketers, public speakers, and businesses. The idea of becoming an “Influencer” and getting your post seen by millions of business and recruitment oriented audience becomes more lucrative.</p>
<h3><strong>Why?</strong></h3>
<p>Because it gives once in a lifetime opportunity to change your life, drive millions in sales, position yourself and business as a leader on the market, connect to investors, potential partners, get a new job, or hire a talent for your company!</p>
<p>Our programme will help you to reach your goals. We don’t and can’t say that it is easy to become influential, but with hard work, plus our help, and your dedication, we can do miracles! Our programme requires a dedication and a contract with us for at least 6 months. This way, we can assure that you get the best traction and results within your goals, deadlines and ideas.</p>
<p>This service is not cheap, but if you are on this page, you clearly understand its value – money don’t buy everything. The unlimited opportunities that will come to you can’t be measured. We will guide you and be helping you all the way to reaching your business goals.</p>
<p><strong>FAQ:</strong></p>
<p><b>Q: Why should I choose you?</b></p>
<p>A: After 7 years of successfully consulting and positioning entrepreneurs, executives, marketing gurus, public speakers, and businesses, we have a proven track of positioning and authority branding individuals. We currently run 10 LinkedIn marketing websites. We partner with a number of reputation management firms in the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><b>Q: Who should participate in this programme?</b></p>
<p>A: This programme is perfect for individuals and businesses planning to build authority branding, drive more traffic to their websites; individuals who want to generate more leads, get new business opportunities, and drive more sales.</p>
<p><b>Q: Why your program lasts for 6 months?</b></p>
<p>A: Millions of people and businesses are now realizing the power of LinkedIn Pulse and what is the added value that Pulse brings them to the table: new business opportunities, more revenue, higher rankings in Google, Yahoo and Bing searches. What most of them don’t realize or understand is how to become popular on Pulse and how to increase your ROI by using it. Well, we specialize in just that.</p>
<p>We have the blueprint and we are here to help you. Our programme lasts for 6 months because our experience clearly shows that getting to the influencer status and getting your Pulse articles picked by LinkedIn takes time, dedication, and money investment. However, the results are invaluable!</p>
<p><b>Q: If I apply for your program and pass the full programme, what’s next for me?</b></p>
<p>A: This is not the end for you. We will be here for you and we will help you to continue to maintain and develop your public status on LinkedIn. This is how we build strong business relations based on trust, results, and transparency.</p>
<p><b>Q: How does the payment work?</b></p>
<p>A: All of our Programme Plans require 1-time payment. After you complete the payment, we will get in touch with you within 1-2 Business Days with more details on how to start.</p>
<p><b>Q:Why do you ask for so much money in advance? Can’t I just pay on month-to-month basis?</b></p>
<p>A: Our programme requires dedication, time, and energy. We believe that if we are committed to work with you and provide the best possible outcome for you, the programme won’t work for you for only 1 month. Best results come within the first 3 to 6 months. Please feel more than welcome to try our Free Trial service*.</p>

<p>We've been working since October 2014 on creating the Nuzzle collar with the goal  to create a smarter pet collar that will improve the lives of pet owners.</p>
<p>We teamed up with Ammunition Design Group, named #1 on Fast Company's list of ""The World's Most Innovative Companies of 2015 in Design."" They have designed, in our humble opinion, the most beautiful collar available: sleek and user-friendly. </p>
<p>We worked hand-in-hand with Ammunition to ensure you have the best collar and user experience possible! With their help, Nuzzle is a collar with a simple and compact design that your pet will love to wear.</p>

<p><b>Q: How do I contact the Nuzzle team?</b></p>
<p>A: Email us at <a href=""mailto:info@hellonuzzle.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/nuzzle-the-most-reliable-gps-pet-collar/contact@hellonuzzle.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact@hellonuzzle.com </a>or direct message us on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. </p>
<p><b>Q: How does Nuzzle locate my pet?</b></p>
<p>A: Nuzzle uses GPS to pinpoint your pet's location when its away from your home. When your pet is close to your home, the collar can communicate with the base station directly, greatly extending battery life.  This is unlike most Bluetooth collars that will not be able to find your dog or cat if it is outside of BT range.  </p>
<p><b>Q: When will Nuzzle start shipping? How much will shipping cost?</b></p>
<p>A: Nuzzle will start shipping in March 2016. The shipping will be free.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is Nuzzle available outside of the US?</b></p>
<p>A: Unfortunately, Nuzzle is only currently available in the U.S. Stay tuned for updates on when the International Edition will be available.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is Nuzzle available in stores or online?</b></p>
<p>A: Currently, Nuzzle is only open for orders via our Indiegogo campaign.</p>

<p>A: Yes! Nuzzle can be used on both cats and dogs.</p>
<p><b>Q: How does Nuzzle locate my pet? </b></p>
<p>A: Nuzzle uses cellular GPS connectivity in addition to bluetooth. That way, unlike most bluetooth only pet collars, if your dog or cat runs off a long distance, you’ll still be able to locate him/her from anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can I use Nuzzle with my dog’s personal collection of collars and harnesses?</b></p>
<p>A: The Nuzzle tracker can be detached and reattached to your own collars and harnesses.</p>
<p><b>Q: Do I need to add Nuzzle to my data plan?</b></p>
<p>A: No! The Nuzzle collar has no additional fees. We factor the data costs into the cost of the collar, so you don’t need to worry about monthly payments.</p>

We're Nuzzle.
A technology-focused pet insurance company created by a team of pet lovers and tech enthusiasts
with a mission to provide a better and smarter pet care products for animal
lovers.




We've been working since October 2014 on creating the Nuzzle collar with the goal  to create a smarter pet collar that will improve the lives of pet owners.
We teamed up with Ammunition Design Group, named #1 on Fast Company's list of ""The World's Most Innovative Companies of 2015 in Design."" They have designed, in our humble opinion, the most beautiful collar available: sleek and user-friendly. 
We worked hand-in-hand with Ammunition to ensure you have the best collar and user experience possible! With their help, Nuzzle is a collar with a simple and compact design that your pet will love to wear.





As we are starting our manufacturing run, we're so excited to share the results of the last year with all of you. 

Thank you for visiting our page and hearing our story. Our mission is to build products that can improve your experience as a pet owner, and we're glad to have you with us!








We are pet people. Most of us will go to ridiculous lengths to keep our animals happy. Some of us will enthusiastically admit to it. Others keep quiet. But deep down we know that we’re all a little crazy. That’s fine by us.













A standard Nuzzle package includes 1 orange Nuzzle collar, 1 attachment for third-party collars and harnesses, 2 batteries, 1 charging base, and 1 USB cord.






Nuzzle will be shipped in early 2016. Currently, Nuzzle is only available in the United States, and shipping in the U.S. is included for free.

GENERAL

How do I get a free Nuzzle Collar?
When logged in on Indiegogo and viewing our campaign page, clicking the ""link"" icon to the left of our main video will allow you to copy this personal link. You can also share this link by clicking any of the social media icons to the left of the video. Use this link to share our page with your friends. If 5 of them make a purchase, you will get a $85 refund. If 10 of them make a purchase, you will get a $169 refund. *If you bought at the Early Bird price, the respective refundable amounts are $75 and $149.


Q: How do I contact the Nuzzle team?
A: Email us at contact@hellonuzzle.com or direct message us on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. 
Q: How does Nuzzle locate my pet?
A: Nuzzle uses GPS to pinpoint your pet's location when its away from your home. When your pet is close to your home, the collar can communicate with the base station directly, greatly extending battery life.  This is unlike most Bluetooth collars that will not be able to find your dog or cat if it is outside of BT range.  
Q: When will Nuzzle start shipping? How much will shipping cost?
A: Nuzzle will start shipping in March 2016. The shipping will be free.
Q: Is Nuzzle available outside of the US?
A: Unfortunately, Nuzzle is only currently available in the U.S. Stay tuned for updates on when the International Edition will be available.
Q: Is Nuzzle available in stores or online?
A: Currently, Nuzzle is only open for orders via our Indiegogo campaign.

COLLAR FEATURES
Q: Is the Nuzzle collar waterproof?
A: Yes!
Q: Can my cat use Nuzzle as well?
A: Yes! Nuzzle can be used on both cats and dogs.
Q: How does Nuzzle locate my pet? 
A: Nuzzle uses cellular GPS connectivity in addition to bluetooth. That way, unlike most bluetooth only pet collars, if your dog or cat runs off a long distance, you’ll still be able to locate him/her from anywhere.
Q: Can I use Nuzzle with my dog’s personal collection of collars and harnesses?
A: The Nuzzle tracker can be detached and reattached to your own collars and harnesses.
Q: Do I need to add Nuzzle to my data plan?
A: No! The Nuzzle collar has no additional fees. We factor the data costs into the cost of the collar, so you don’t need to worry about monthly payments.
Q: Who do I contact for tech support and questions about using my Nuzzle collar?
A: Please email us at contact@hellonuzzle.com

INSURANCE
Q: Do I need to buy insurance if I get a collar?
A:  No.  The insurance is strictly optional.  
Q: Can I use the app if I don't buy the insurance?


A:  Of course.  There will never be any restrictions on the app or collar usage.",52.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>How it works:</h3>
<p><br/>Chat (or use the easy data interfaces) with different coaches (customized chat-bots) on your Smart Phone, web browser or voice enabled home devices like Amazon Alexa to achieve your goals and collect data on your life. <br/>Every Coach has different abilities. Choose the right coaches based on your needs.<br/>What they do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily Diary / Mood Diary / Baby Journal / Period tracker / Checklist / Sleep Tracking</li>
<li>Health Diary / Food Allergy Calculator / Medicine Comparer / Loose Weight</li>
<li>Habit Changer / Dynamic Routines / Motivator / ""todo list that screams at you""</li>
<li>Annoying Reminder / Flexible Calendar  / Workout Drill</li>
<li>Nutrition Information (Calories, Carbohydrates, fats ...)</li>
<li>Analytics: Compare your data, get insight and draw conclusions (eg. every time I eat carbohydrates I feel bad)</li>
<li>A word a day .. learn a new language word by word</li>
<li>Vocabulary trainer</li>
<li>Hands-free time tracking for work, house work and other activities</li>
<li>more to come when the app is released</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Coach app is <strong>synced</strong> accross <strong>multiple devices</strong>. It works on iOS and Android, on Web Browsers and voice enabled home devices like Amazon Echo (Alexa) or Google Home. You can enter data anytime and get the best possible effortless user experience. Talk to Siri, Google Now or Amazon Alexa while you prepare your meal to ask about nutrition information or tell the sergeant how many pull-ups you just finished while working out. <strong>Hands-free!</strong> </p><p>Integration with sport devices and custom hardware tracking devices coming soon. </p><p>Have devices that you want to be connected to the coaches?<br/>We're looking forward to your suggestions for further improvements and integrations.</p><p> </p><h3>Why it works:</h3><p><br/>While classic todo list apps, reminders and diaries just send you standard notifications, these coaches really chat with you. <strong>They get angry</strong> when you don't fill in your diary data or don't start with your assignment one week before deadline. <strong>They support you</strong> when you need help to finish stuff or want to learn more about your health. <strong>They give feedback</strong> on your performance so you know exactly how well you did. <strong>They motivate you</strong> throughout the day and all hobbies. <strong>Push your limits!</strong></p><p>Do you have a problem finishing the tasks on your todo list? Sergeant can help you with that!<br/>Do you forget to make entries in your health diary? Dr. Sugar will nag you until you do it ....</p><p> </p><div>
<h3>Risks:</h3>
<p><br/><strong>None.</strong> We make use of the Sergeant Coach ourselves so no procrastination can stop us from finishing this app. Sergeant helps everyone to finish tasks!<br/>We already created a working prototype and need to polish it for public release in February. Subscribe for beta-testing now to give it a try -&gt; <a href=""http://www.pianobear.cool/Coach"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.pianobear.cool/Coach</a></p>
<p> </p>

Chores have never been so much fun 
The Coach App is home to coaches of different expertise who help you to organize your life. Get stuff done, find out about food allergies, track calories, work out and get analytics on everything. This app does it all. With character. Select your coach and start becoming a better you.
Meet the Coaches
Sergeant: He is the right one if you need directions. Unlike a normal reminder he will nag you .. until you finished. Recurring tasks, work-out routines, dead lines ... adjust his yelling-ness to your liking and get it done.
Dr. Sugar: Beside diabetes he can help you to deal with a lot of different illnesses by maintaining a special medical diary. Find out about food intolerance and allergies, check if your mood reflects on your body functions and get insights with statistics and conclusions.BTW: Data collected by Dr. Sugar will help your real life doctor to make a better diagnose.
Horny: She is a unicorn. Can help you with decisions, wasting time and guided procrastination. 
Early Bird: He used to sleep in, but now he learned to get out of bed early. So can you! Learn to maintain a good sleep circle and become perfectly relaxed.
Yogi: Mindful breaks during the day, guided meditation, small yoga exercises ... the yogi is your master.
Mom: Do you miss your mother telling you to dress and eat properly, how she's always right and about her opinion on everything. Seize your chance with this Coach. ""YES MOM!""
Chat Bot: Daily diary, questions about your day and collecting random data you want to make sense of with statistics and analytics. This robot will not complain .. after all, he's just a bot.

Why the coaches need you?
Even coaches need to improve.While the basic functionalities of the smart phone app are already working, the coaches need to get more convenient features and polished dialogues. With your money you support the coaching of the coaches for an even better experience for all users. And we can make the Sergeant and his fellow coaches available to voice enabled home devices by the time of the official release. Help us move to different platforms so everyone can use the app on as many platforms as possible in sync. And let us add more fun.
Official release of the coach app in February 2018! Please subscribe for beta testing now so you can start working on your new year resolution right away and give us valuable feedback.
-> www.pianobear.cool/Coach#Beta
 

What you get out of it:

Discipline
Insight on your health and life
Daily routines
Get rid of bad habits
much more!

... and with supporting the project now you get a special discount up to -50%. All money collected with this campaign goes directly to the coaches so they can do a better job answering questions, reminding you and helping you. 

IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE TO TELL EVERYONE ABOUT IT!The more people who support us, the faster we can build additional features that further improve the experience with the Coach app for everyone. So please spread the word and enjoy the improvements together.
What happens if we receive more money than we asked for:
> 5.000 EURGerman Version and Viennese slang.

> 7.000 EURAdditional Language. Vote for your favorite language -> www.pianobear.cool/Coach#VoteLanguage
>  10.000 EURMini-Game featuring Sergeant and Horny in the app> 15.000 EUR2 Additional Coaches. Vote for them -> www.pianobear.cool/Coach#NewCoaches
What the future will bring: actual hardware devices to change bad eating habits, connecting with IoT and smart homes, improve story telling with the characters and many other things.
 
How it works:
Chat (or use the easy data interfaces) with different coaches (customized chat-bots) on your Smart Phone, web browser or voice enabled home devices like Amazon Alexa to achieve your goals and collect data on your life. Every Coach has different abilities. Choose the right coaches based on your needs.What they do:

Daily Diary / Mood Diary / Baby Journal / Period tracker / Checklist / Sleep Tracking
Health Diary / Food Allergy Calculator / Medicine Comparer / Loose Weight
Habit Changer / Dynamic Routines / Motivator / ""todo list that screams at you""
Annoying Reminder / Flexible Calendar  / Workout Drill
Nutrition Information (Calories, Carbohydrates, fats ...)
Analytics: Compare your data, get insight and draw conclusions (eg. every time I eat carbohydrates I feel bad)
A word a day .. learn a new language word by word
Vocabulary trainer
Hands-free time tracking for work, house work and other activities
more to come when the app is released

Coach app is synced accross multiple devices. It works on iOS and Android, on Web Browsers and voice enabled home devices like Amazon Echo (Alexa) or Google Home. You can enter data anytime and get the best possible effortless user experience. Talk to Siri, Google Now or Amazon Alexa while you prepare your meal to ask about nutrition information or tell the sergeant how many pull-ups you just finished while working out. Hands-free! Integration with sport devices and custom hardware tracking devices coming soon. Have devices that you want to be connected to the coaches?We're looking forward to your suggestions for further improvements and integrations. Why it works:While classic todo list apps, reminders and diaries just send you standard notifications, these coaches really chat with you. They get angry when you don't fill in your diary data or don't start with your assignment one week before deadline. They support you when you need help to finish stuff or want to learn more about your health. They give feedback on your performance so you know exactly how well you did. They motivate you throughout the day and all hobbies. Push your limits!Do you have a problem finishing the tasks on your todo list? Sergeant can help you with that!Do you forget to make entries in your health diary? Dr. Sugar will nag you until you do it .... 
Risks:
None. We make use of the Sergeant Coach ourselves so no procrastination can stop us from finishing this app. Sergeant helps everyone to finish tasks!We already created a working prototype and need to polish it for public release in February. Subscribe for beta-testing now to give it a try -> www.pianobear.cool/Coach

Smart : Disruptive tech products making your life easier and seamless.

Music : Innovation meets musical artefacts & instruments. 

Ecology : Green innovative products with impactful vision. 

Design/Art : Groundbreaking work of designers & artists pushing the boundaries of creativity. 
 Pick & Pow is also a resourceful online magazine with insightful articles, interviews, as well as documentaries, about all upcoming innovative ideas and trends.Affiliation modelThrough an affiliation model established with innovative startups, we select and display their latest and most impactful products. We built Pick&Pow to link early adopters and other innovation-oriented users to these new products. For every product you like, you’ll be able to visit its e-shop to buy and empower it !Tick tock, tick tock...Every product on our platform has a lifespan, visible through a countdown on its page. Each time a Pick&Pow user visits the product website, or shares it with his friends, we add extra hours to the project lifespan.For visiting the startup website : 1 extra hoursFor sharing the product with friends : 12 extra hours-> Members are indeed empowering the products by allowing them to stay visible on the website, and by providing feedback.I'm a winner !Yes, YOU really are ! To thank you for the incredible help you’re providing to startups, we decided to share our commissions with you. What ?! What do you mean ? We give away a piece of the cake in the form of permanent discounts ! And last but not least, you’ll have the privilege of joining the first “innovation 1st” community.Today, an aggressive number of startups are founded around a physical product to sell. The simple fact that people take the risk to start up should be enough to unveil their project.However, with technology moving at an exponentially faster pace, people don’t have the time to hear about and discover all innovative projects, especially those lacking online visibility. Therefore, in addition to bringing awareness on today’s coolest & most impactful innovations, our main goal is to help startups to gain visibility, feedback and sales: to be empowered.On the other hand, part of our objective is to counteract complex and discriminating marketplace that only highlights popular products. We want to design a new way to introduce new products to early adopters, by focusing on the ones with real innovation impact and by showcasing all available products, not just the popular ones.
STARTUPS: Startups display their new products on a dedicated platform, and get to target early adopters. Moreover, startups will have access to a private network in order to share concerns, solutions and discuss smart partnerships with other startups.
USER: In addition to the permanent discounts, the user will be able to create an account in our innovation district; a community of innovators eager to connect with each others, share ideas, trends and updates around Innovation.
Our Pick & Pow magazine will offer readers carefully curated content and entertaining videos on upcoming ideas and latest trends.

 Since we started the Pick&Pow adventure, we wanted to show people that innovation is as extremely interesting and relevant as cool ! Thus, we created an Innovation Vlog (youtube channel) where we release entertaining and unconventional videos presenting cool products !
Today, we need you guys to allow us (Alex, Hilaire and Lina) to continue our great project and empower it ;)

<h2>Task Queue</h2>
<p>We have already written a <a href=""https://discuss.tryton.org/t/transactional-queue/461"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blueprint</a> to describe the design of the solution. It will be a replacement for our existing <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/celery_tryton"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">celery_tryton</a> library but deeply integrated in the core of Tryton. Thus it would be used by the standard modules.<br/>But as many other pluggable tools of Tryton, it will be possible to replace the queue by another implementation.</p>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Available for standard modules</li>
<li>Use only <a href=""https://www.postgresql.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PostgreSQL</a> (no extra database)</li>
<li>Easy to use inside Tryton modules</li>
<li>Fallback in case the back-end is not supported</li>
<li>Transactional queue (job starts only when transaction is committed)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notification</h2>
<p>A <a href=""https://discuss.tryton.org/t/real-time-notification/224"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blueprint</a> exists since some times now. This new feature will allow the user to react quicker to business events because he will be notified in real-time. Also if the user starts a long running task (thanks to the queue), we will be able to notify him directly when the task is finished. From the notification he will be able to see the result. The notification will also be able to warn user about possible future saving conflicts when two users are editing the same record. It will also allow to send message (info, warning or error) when the user is filling a form but before he saves it (from an on_change query).</p>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Faster notifications (could replace email in many cases)</li>
<li>More interactions between the system and the user</li>
<li>Prevent issue earlier</li>
<li>Feed the user with information at the right time (when filling form instead of saving)</li>

<h3>Raring to Go!</h3>
<div>I am a Baby Boomer. I hate to say it, but I just don't have the physical strength or range of motion I used to have.</div>
<div>I am ""retired"" and while working in the garden and around the house I realized I can't do at age 65 what I could do at age 45. Digging holes to plant trees, etc. is pretty much out of the question without some kind of mechanical assistance. Sure there are mini versions of tractors and the like but even those are too large or expensive for most of us.</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>I Want to design <i>Can-Do-Tools</i>
</h3>
<div>Can-Do-Tools will help those of us with limited strength or range of motion to be more active and do what we want.</div>
<div>The name of my company will be Jouleup (joule-the unit of power, up-to fill with.)</div>
<div>I will need some tools to be able to design and make the prototypes.</div>
<div>Please help me get the first tool, it is a 5 Head 3D Printer which is coming out as a <i>Kickstarter</i> project. The project is from ORDSolutions.com the picture of the printer shown is from them (used with permission.) Sorry for the poor quality of my picture, I borrowed it from their campaign page and I don't have the software to make it look as good as theirs. The title of this project is <i>5 Color/Material 3D Filament Printer - Made In Canada</i>. The printer will cost $2314.00 including shipping and some filament. Their campaign is over in a few days, but they have kept the purchase window open until November 30, 2013.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Over the years I have picked-up a considerable amount of electronic and mechanical skills. I want to put this knowledge to good use.</li>
<li>I want to design what I call Can-Do-Tools that will assist those of us with limited strength and or range of motion to do what we want to do.</li>
<li>When these Can-Do-Tools have all the bugs out, I want to get them manufactured and offer them to the public.</li>
</ul>
<div>What the money will be used for:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>Purchasing the printer $2314.</li>
<li>Stickers, key-chains and other perks $250.</li>
<li>Indiegogo and other fees $230.</li>

<p>This project is dedicated to all of the motivated, active doers out there – people that are marking it happen, starting an organization or business, or possibly struggling to run one.  There’s a lot to know about online branding, social media, promotional campaigns and events, or whatever else you might need for awareness of your organization or to compete better.</p>
<p>I’m working with my colleagues in marketing and digital media to create an app to solve this problem by providing people free marketing information.  Our team is dedicated to bringing high-level expertise to everyone and simplifying it through a series of clicks: providing answers and access to resources. But we don’t have a budget for this…it’s a new thing we think deserves to come alive and you can join us in making this dream a reality.</p>
<p><strong>A bit more on who we are:</strong> I’m a marketing consultant and I got my start in professional media in 1994 when I worked on writing and production of a Warner Brothers DVD title.  Since then, the years have consisted of consulting with various companies in entertainment, technology and health care. During this time, my network of designers and media technologists has grown. This idea all started with a group chat about our clients.  We all noticed that one frustration kept reemerging in this current online era: our non-profits and small to medium business customers were frustrated that they couldn’t afford to stay on top of all the media and marketing changes.</p>
<p>So, we wondered….why do our corporate clients get to jump on every emerging opportunity while other clients struggle?  Each startup or non-profit group we talked to seemed flummoxed whereas the corporate folks could get a new expert for each new thing. The problem was one of scale. A single person or a small operation can’t afford to hire a Social Media Manager…so how could they get the same kind of consulting advice for smaller organizations as well?</p>
<p>Seeking to solve the problem, the idea of <strong>eConcierge Marketing Assistant</strong> was born.  It’s not fair that only large enterprises can get the expertise they need for new online opportunities.  With so much to sort through, so many challenges to finding answers, people need a helpful tool.</p>
<p>On this note, the eConcierge M.A. app will be available on major phone and pad platforms (iOS, Android) to provide answers to current digital marketing struggles.  Whether you need to create a catchy brand and get it live on the Web for your cause, or to have a better presence on social media, eConcierge will help.</p>
<p><strong>How the app will work:</strong> The user experience we’ve designed for the app is a drilldown approach.  For example, you’ll first select a broad information category like Social Media, this click will present you some choices like: Selecting best ones for your needs; Creating content plans; or How to easily manage your media.  This will give you more specific areas to learn about, like product or service oriented social media – Pinterest for example, is better for products than services.  From these final clicks, you’ll get a HOW TO page that provides: An overview of how to do it best, recommended steps to go through, and resources which will include a mixture of recommended service companies, online references, and keywords to use for more information. </p>
<h3>The budget breakdown:</h3>
<p>$5,000 – Registering trademark, legal, creating related Web site<br/>$15,000 – User interface design and app coding, content database development<br/>$5,000 – Media buy to promote the app and get feedback for improvements</p>
<p>Total $25,000</p>
<p>If we exceed this goal, we will put more money into additional features and broader media buys to get the word out to even more people.</p>
<p><strong>Get involved!:</strong> We’re excited to take our categorized and growing library of reference information with fresh techniques and info from our combined years of marketing and media consulting experience and get it out to everybody as a user-friendly tool!  The app will have a wealth of information on dozens of current subjects, get updated frequently, and provide actual steps to take for success.</p>
<p>To get the app created, we are giving this project until February 28th to hit its funding goal and then we’ll start designing, programming and promoting it.  With your support, eConciergeMA will be available for download in the Spring.  As we manage the software design and development process, we will also create a Web page with a portion of the funds to continue to update our contributors about progress.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest and support of this new app project. It will enable so many.</p></div>","Thank you for taking interest and visiting our Indiegogo page for eConcierge Marketing Assistant.

We especially want to help small yet passionate magazine companies to see their publications reach the European market, and create a simple, collaborative and communicative online space to advertise them. In specialising in independent creative magazines that feature handmade culture, photography, art and stories, our website allows our customers to explore and discover new publications with complementary content and style.Right now, it’s extremely costly, difficult and sometimes not even possible for Europeans to buy fine-art magazines from overseas. There are many creative people who are living in Europe who would benefit from being able to access these publications, which are not usually media-based or nationally-exclusive in their content and therefore just as relevant in Europe as they would be anywhere else. We provide a fast and easy way for customers to buy magazines, and we provide magazines with a valuable stockist connection in Europe.www.hearthmagazine.com - www.readcereal.com -  www.puregreenmag.com www.chickpeamagazine.com - www.wolftree.co - www.ohcomely.co.ukwww.taprootmag.com - www.holeandcornermagazine.com ... and more!

If your kids are 3-5 </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">years old - you spend <b>HOURS of your time</b> just picking up </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">toys from the floor...</span></p>
<p>We are trying to get this time by investing in accommodations like <b>robotic vacuum cleaners</b>, <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>laundry machines</b>, different <b>electronic gadgets</b>.</span></p>
<p>We use plenty of tools to speed up our life but as a result - <i><b>we do not gain</b></i> much time using them.</p>
<p>What could be a <b>real solution</b> is an <b><i>autonomous household robot</i></b>, which could do the most of cleaning <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">tasks, and not only cleaning the floor, but also put things on its places, remove dust from </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">shelves, watch your house, reheat food, feed pets, water plants and so on...</span></p>
<p>I would buy such robot, but there are <b>two problems</b>:</p>
<p>First, such robots <b>ARE NOT AFFORDABLE </b>or <b>NOT AVAILABLE </b>yet! <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">For instance, there is no retail price for ASIMO. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Robot Romeo is not for sale yet. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Pepper robot is for sale for about $2000 but it's more talking toy than household robot. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It's not designed for durable household tasks.</span></p>
<p>OK, let's me to make robot from kit. And here is <b>the second problem</b>:</p>
<p> Do such <b>kits exist</b>? <b>The answer is NO</b>.</p>
<p>It means that there is <b>NO ROBOT KIT</b> available yet...</p>
<p>Because every serious company is doing only <b>military</b> or <b>rescue </b>robots.</p>
<p>There is one company which did arms mimicking the moves of chief cook and they sell it <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">for $15000... But it's just cooking, what about other tasks?</span></p>
<p>Well... <b>What I could do about it</b>?</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p></p>
<p>I'm a professional Embedded Software Developer, with background in Physics and <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I also have good experience in electronics and mechanical design.</span></p>
<p>My main goal is to give people the opportunity to get a personal autonomous robot, <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">which could be useful for everyday household tasks.</span></p>
<p>I have been already working on this project for about 3 years on my own in my free time, but I would like to speed up the development and share my blueprints and detailed assembly instructions with anyone who is willing to build such a robot for him(her)self.</p>
<p>Your contribution is very important for me because it could make a huge impact on the future of robotics, people's education in robotics and it will make possible to get an affordable household robot for curious people.</p>

<p>Since I have been already working on this project for 3 years - it's my main hobby <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">project during this time, I devote almost all my free time to it. It is about 20 hours a week. </span></p>
<p>I also work full time as an Embedded Software Developer and it slows down the constrution <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">of the robot. </span></p>
<p>If I could work on the robot full time, it would speed up the development about <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">3 times. In order to be able t</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">o leave my job and work on robot project I need your help.</span></p>
<p>So, 70% of the money you contribute will mainly go to my salary for 1 year. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I've already spent about $3000 for the robot, and I need about $2000 </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">for the remaining materials and electronic components. </span></p>
<p>I'm trying to keep <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Bill of Materials for the robot below $5000 to make it affordable for many people. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">All materials I use could be bought in local hardware stores or got from internet stores. No fancy materials are used. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The mechanical and circuits design is mostly done, but some parts might need rework and/or optimization.</span></p>
<p>In case I get funds, my friend (who is working as a full time software developer) <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">agreed to help me to speed up software development for the robot. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It can take about 20% of total amount.</span></p>
<p>About 5% of the money will go to my other friend (who is a technical writer) to review and fix the final <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">version of the assembly instruction manual.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can't deliver a robot to everyone because I don't have such facilities <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">to produce kits, but I can create detailed step-by-step instructions </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">and provide all CAD, STL, and circuits files for everyone, as a single piece or in parts.</span></p>
<p>The full assembly instruction will have about 1000 pages. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It will be split into chapters.

<p>Even if you don't have enough of money and patience to make full robot you can <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">get the necessary part of manual and use it for you own project.</span></p>

<p>I'm following the development of robotics in the world for a prolonged period of time <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">and I must admit that I'm not satisfied with what I see. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span>A large amount of robot kits is oriented for kids and school boys/girls with a single goal of education.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>On the other hand we have big companies developing finished products that are not affordable for the majority of people.</p>
<p>The only useful robots we have today are robotic vacuum cleaners and lawn mowers.</p>
<p>The robotics labs which create full scale <span style=""background-color: initial;"">humanoid</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> robots (like Buster, Justin, ASIMO, etc) </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">are still under research and </span>improvement<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, and they are not oriented to assist </span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">you at home or not affordable.</span></p>
<p>Observing this situation - I realized that all interesting things can pass aside <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">me, and my dream to have a personal robot assistant might never come true unless I </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">design and build my own robot.</span></p>
<p>I have good experience in the construction of various mechanical things because I <span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">started from young age.

<p>I have also started to work as<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> Embedded software developer and since 2006 I mainly work in </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">this area.

<p>In 2011 I started building a CNC mill of my own design and finished it <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">in 2012. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Two years later I had assembled Rostok Max 3D printer </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">from the kit.

<p>Around that time the idea of household robot came to my mind.

<p>The purpose of this robot is to perform functions of a ""mobile intelligent house"".

The modern life is too dynamic, everything we are trying to do is to make more things in a shorter period of time, we are trying to squeeze the time.
We do more and more routine tasks and leave no time for creation/ art/ rest/ outdoor.

If you are young mother and want to devote all your time to your baby - you have less time to clean you home... If your kids are 3-5 years old - you spend HOURS of your time just picking up toys from the floor...
We are trying to get this time by investing in accommodations like robotic vacuum cleaners, laundry machines, different electronic gadgets.
We use plenty of tools to speed up our life but as a result - we do not gain much time using them.
What could be a real solution is an autonomous household robot, which could do the most of cleaning tasks, and not only cleaning the floor, but also put things on its places, remove dust from shelves, watch your house, reheat food, feed pets, water plants and so on...
I would buy such robot, but there are two problems:
First, such robots ARE NOT AFFORDABLE or NOT AVAILABLE yet! For instance, there is no retail price for ASIMO. Robot Romeo is not for sale yet. Pepper robot is for sale for about $2000 but it's more talking toy than household robot. It's not designed for durable household tasks.
OK, let's me to make robot from kit. And here is the second problem:
 Do such kits exist? The answer is NO.
It means that there is NO ROBOT KIT available yet...
Because every serious company is doing only military or rescue robots.
There is one company which did arms mimicking the moves of chief cook and they sell it for $15000... But it's just cooking, what about other tasks?
Well... What I could do about it?


 I can sit and wait until somebody creates a household robot and put it on the market. It can take 1-5 years before it happens. Even after this happens the price of robot might be too high.

OR


I can design my own robot for all tasks and make a company to produce robot kits. In this case I'll get what I want much sooner and it will permits to free me and my family a lot of time. 

Really, YOUR FREE TIME is PRICELESS...Of cause I can't propose robot kits now, I'm not there yet, but having one working prototype I can go the next step by starting the campaign to build robot kits for people who would like to build similar robot from kit.

Short Summary 
I'm a professional Embedded Software Developer, with background in Physics and I also have good experience in electronics and mechanical design.
My main goal is to give people the opportunity to get a personal autonomous robot, which could be useful for everyday household tasks.
I have been already working on this project for about 3 years on my own in my free time, but I would like to speed up the development and share my blueprints and detailed assembly instructions with anyone who is willing to build such a robot for him(her)self.
Your contribution is very important for me because it could make a huge impact on the future of robotics, people's education in robotics and it will make possible to get an affordable household robot for curious people.


(Preliminary design, actuators are not shown)
What We Need & What You Get
 
Since I have been already working on this project for 3 years - it's my main hobby project during this time, I devote almost all my free time to it. It is about 20 hours a week. 
I also work full time as an Embedded Software Developer and it slows down the constrution of the robot. 
If I could work on the robot full time, it would speed up the development about 3 times. In order to be able to leave my job and work on robot project I need your help.
So, 70% of the money you contribute will mainly go to my salary for 1 year. I've already spent about $3000 for the robot, and I need about $2000 for the remaining materials and electronic components. 
I'm trying to keep Bill of Materials for the robot below $5000 to make it affordable for many people. All materials I use could be bought in local hardware stores or got from internet stores. No fancy materials are used. The mechanical and circuits design is mostly done, but some parts might need rework and/or optimization.
In case I get funds, my friend (who is working as a full time software developer) agreed to help me to speed up software development for the robot. It can take about 20% of total amount.
About 5% of the money will go to my other friend (who is a technical writer) to review and fix the final version of the assembly instruction manual.
Unfortunately, I can't deliver a robot to everyone because I don't have such facilities to produce kits, but I can create detailed step-by-step instructions and provide all CAD, STL, and circuits files for everyone, as a single piece or in parts.
The full assembly instruction will have about 1000 pages. It will be split into chapters. Each chapter will refer to a specific part of the robot: eyes, head, torso, arms, bottom and hips, wheeled platform.
Even if you don't have enough of money and patience to make full robot you can get the necessary part of manual and use it for you own project.



$5: If you are curious about this project but not able to build this robot,  you'll receive the latest updates by email.


$25: Wheeled base assembly instruction manual. The wheeled platform itself could be an autonomous robot, suitable for some transportation tasks and also for different experiments with robots. Corresponding STL, CAD, electric circuits for the wheeled base are included.


$50: Eyes assembly manual. All plans, CAD, electric schematic for eyes are included.


$50: Arm assembly instructions + arm files.


$50: Bottom and hips assembly + bottom part files.

$100: Full assembly instructions + all design files.


If I don't reach my entire goal I will still be working on this project on my own.



If I collect form $0 to $20000 I would buy the remaining materials and spend the rest of money for software development with my programmer friend. An estimate for the project duration is about 3 years in this case.


If I collect from $20000 to $60000 I would finish prototype, write detailed assembly instructions and continue to design software with my friends in my free time. The time needed to finish the project is about 2 years for this situation.


If I collect from $60000 to $100000 I will leave my permanent job and work full time on the robot project, according to the plan. The estimate of delivery time is about 1+ year.


If I reach or go over my full goal:



In case I collect from $100000 to $150000 I will make video tutorial for the assembly of this robot.


If I collect more than $150000 I'll think about organizing small company for producing kits for this robot.


If I collect more that $200000 I'll surely start the company to produce robot kits. 




The Impact
 
I'm following the development of robotics in the world for a prolonged period of time and I must admit that I'm not satisfied with what I see. A large amount of robot kits is oriented for kids and school boys/girls with a single goal of education.
On the other hand we have big companies developing finished products that are not affordable for the majority of people.
The only useful robots we have today are robotic vacuum cleaners and lawn mowers.
The robotics labs which create full scale humanoid robots (like Buster, Justin, ASIMO, etc) are still under research and improvement, and they are not oriented to assist you at home or not affordable.
Observing this situation - I realized that all interesting things can pass aside me, and my dream to have a personal robot assistant might never come true unless I design and build my own robot.
I have good experience in the construction of various mechanical things because I started from young age. My father permitted me to repair his motorbike and his car when I was 13-16 years old. At the age of 18 I'd build the walk-behind tractor with 13 h.p. motorcycle engine. I had designed and assembled a gearbox for it to have a reverse shift. Two years later my father and I had built a small tractor with 75h.p. car engine.
I have also started to work as Embedded software developer and since 2006 I mainly work in this area. I was quite good in analogue electronics since childhood, and after I had started to work as an embedded developer I've acquired some valuable experience in digital electronics.
In 2011 I started building a CNC mill of my own design and finished it in 2012. Two years later I had assembled Rostok Max 3D printer from the kit. Since then I have started to use CAD tools systematically, to print parts on my 3D printer.
Around that time the idea of household robot came to my mind. I'm convinced that my experience, skills and knowledge are enough to design and assemble a complex enough robot.
The purpose of this robot is to perform functions of a ""mobile intelligent house"". To achieve this two conditions are needed: good 3D vision and dexterous human-like arms.
I designed both.

Eyes have proven design and works fine. Video and still frames could be taken from both eyes and processed. Eyes have the sensors of position with a precision of 0.1 degree. 
Another complex thing was the arm. I didn't find an arm with a good design and robustness on the internet. Some of them are good, but not good enough. I have designed a robotic arm which is driven by 24 motors and is able reproduce the majority of human motions.




All other parts of robot are not so sophisticated and could be completed in different ways.
To build it you will need to:



Be able to work with hand tools and soldering iron.


Have access to a 3D printer and a (CNC) mill.


Have spare $5000 for materials and electronics. (instruments price not included)


Have a robot assembly manual (from me)


Have plenty of free time. 


You'll get a real opportunity to build your own human-like robot, which you would be able to program as you wish.
The complexity and dexterity of this robot is higher than any existing commercial humanoid robot in the world! 
After you complete it you'll be able to maintain or even improve it, thanks to a modular design.
You will learn deeply all aspects of creating complex robotics system and it most probably will define your future employment or business.
This system has a big potential for programmers, as they could design their own software - all the information will be open and available.
I'm pretty sure that Chinese industry will start to make the kits based on these drawings which would also speed up the penetration of robots into masses and increase their affordability.
It might make huge impact on our lives in the nearest 5-10 years.
   Risks & Challenges  
There are couple of challenges in this project.
The main challenge of this project is software. Mainly it will be the computer vision and correlated hands motion. As far as I know, this problem has already been solved many times by other people and there are a lot of inverse kinematic libraries. I don't see any crucial obstacles on this way.
Another challenge is voice command recognition. This problem was also solved by many robot designers and there exists a lot of examples on the internet (Inmoov, Loki, etc)

This is our 2nd campaign on Indiegogo, and we are excited to bring you the newest addition to our home workspace gadgetry - The PowerEdge. Thank you all for your continued support!     Not Your Average Monitor Stand The Flujo PowerEdge is currently the World’s First Monitor Stand with Modular USB-C Multifunction Docking Station.Are you worried that the computer accessories you buy for your work-from-home arrangements become white elephants once the COVID-19 blows over? This is where the PowerEdge comes in. It is engineered for modern people who don't only work at home, but also have to zip around town with their laptops. No matter where you are, the PowerEdge is designed to suit the new normal, to keep you productive and your cables neatly in place, whilst providing extra connectivity to your computer.  It is your monitor or laptop's new companion.   Who is the PowerEdge for?The PowerEdge is built for anyone, really. Students, professionals, videomakers, businessmen - literally anyone in the digital world that owns a workspace.   Although working from home slated to become the new normal, not everyone is equipped to work productively from home. This makes us tempted to buy new computer accessories as a panacea to our home workspace problems, but fear that they become useless after normality resumes. The PowerEdge addresses this, by creating incorporating a modular hub with the monitor stand.    The PowerEdge Hub is also the dongle hack that helps keep your workspace organized on what's important and boost your productivity at work. It can not only be used at home but also in your office. It combines all the essential ports that you need (and lack) for the latest Mac devices.    We pit the PowerEdge against existing monitor stands out there. From the available ports, to warranty provided, all the way to the price of PowerEdge, PowerEdge triumph champion.  The PowerEdge packs innovation and functionality. All you need in a work-desk AND MORE - PowerEdge covers you left, right, centre.  Low screen position of monitors and laptops forces us to adopt awkward postures, and yet we still wonder how'd we get all those backaches and hunchbacks. Gone are the days of using books and piles of paper. Elevate your screen to eye-level for a healthy and comfortable viewing experience. It is scientifically proven to ease the strain on your eyes and neck with a parallel eye-view. In addition, the added space below allows you to stow away your keyboard and mouse for tidier desktop space. It also provides ventilation for your monitor, laptop, printer, or TV screen to cool down.       Most importantly, it looks much better than a stack of books! What's special about the PowerEdge is its modular grab-and-go design. On its own, the PowerEdge Adaptor Hub is a 10-in-1 that offers multifunctional uses. Slide the Hub off the rack system and now you have a portable adaptor hub to use on-the-go. Perfect for traveling once normal life resumes.Attaching and detaching the Hub is very simple. Simply pull the hooks upwards and outwards and slot the Hub one side at a time. Release the hooks into the side of the Hub until you hear a 'click' sound. Ensure the Hub is nicely fitted and voila~     Our cables are often in a disarray, cluttering our desks, and our laptops and monitors lack the ports that we need for maximum productivity mode.   The PowerEdge keeps your cables neatly in place and keeps you looking sharp and smart.   From our previous campaign with the Signature Pro, we have received lots of feedback on the types of ports that you would like to see in your Flujo device. Hence, we have made a number of new additions in the new PowerEdge! Output:
HDMI Version 2.0: 4K@30Hz

USB-A: USB 3.0 × 2 (Up to 5Gbps）

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div>PetDocNow is a dream that has finally come to fruition. We still need your help and that is why we are here.My team and I have been working day and night to develop a site, <b>PetDocNow.com</b>, in which pet owners all over the country will be more accesible to their veterinarians. We treat our pet's as family and therefore we need to ensure the health of our furry friends. The site will feature veterinarians all over the country showing their location, educational credentials, hours of operations and honors received. The problem is that there is no easy access to veterinarians today. Waiting on hold is the ""old fashioned"" way of getting things done. When our pets are sick we can't wait 2-5 days and they of course can't take themselves. So this project has been a sincere passion for my team members and I to make vet care more accessible to pet owners and making our pets healthier one click at a time.</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>In recent study done by Bayer Health Care it stressed the need for an online scheduling tool for veterinarians. In our busy lives we don't have the time anymore to make a phone call even as simple as it may seem. The trend in today's day in age is that people no longer need to call for a dinner reservation, no longer need to call to schedule a doctors appointment, book a flight, hotel, or no longer need to wait in line to buy certain things. The internet is changing the way people interact with one another everyday. Pet owners will now get to make informed decisions as to what veterinarian to take there pet to. They will also be able to see what other people say through reviews and also give their own feedback. If we don't get the pledges we need we will continue to strive to get this project up and running. Our pets need us and so do many other people who have animals. ""Passion does not stop because of a simple word, no""!</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to get this project going we need to raise $25,0000 for the site to be built. Friends and family are doing their part to help as the project costs much more. We are right on schedule but need your help to finish this project and help pet owners all over the country. Help us fight the fight to ensure that all of our pet's are not only healthy but live a long life!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can also help us by following us on twitter @petdocnow or visiting our site to make a pledge that way. The best way you can help is by helping our pets stay healthy by spreading the word about what we are doing. </p>
<p>Thank you in advance and we will update all of our pledgers as the project unfolds!</p>

Do you know where the nearest testing center is, and if you should get tested? How do you properly protect yourself from sexually tranmitted diseases if you're sexually active?</strong></p>
<p>For the last two years I've been collecting ideas for an iPhone app to answer all these questions. Well, I finally got tired of asking questions. It's time to make a solution.</p>
<p><strong>What is TrickTrackr and Why Might I Use it?</strong></p>
<p>TrickTrackr is an app that I've been creating in my spare time to help you keep track of your romantic or intimate social life. If you're like me, you probably don't have a calendar event created on your iPhone for those times you might have gone too far on a date, or even just went on a date. I can't remember what I ate for breakfast last week, let alone the day I dated so and so, what we did, or how far we went.</p>
<p>That's where TrickTrackr comes in. With this app you can quickly log a trick and go back to what you were doing. Or, if you had a really good date you can be more specific. At this point, you might be thinking, ""I never hook-up. I don't even really date, so why would I use this app?"". Good question! Here's where TrickTrackr is different from your other apps that you might consider using.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
<p>Our app isn't just a little black book where you store your conquests, in fact, it's focus is quite the opposite. Did you know that the US is on the top ten list of nations with people living with HIV AIDS? (<a href=""http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?t=100&amp;v=35"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?t=100&amp;v=35</a> ) Most of us probably had to go to a ""Health Class"" in high school where they taught us the birds and the bees. If your school was like mine, they didn't really cover that much except ""abstinence before marriage"". While that's a great goal, most of us don't really work like that.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, that ""More than half of all people will have an STD/STI at some point in their lifetime"" . (<a href=""http://www.ashastd.org/std-sti/std-statistics.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ashastd.org/std-sti/std-statistics.html</a> ) If you or a friend needed to be responsible and went to your local AIDS Foundation group today to get tested for HIV, they would inform you that the test is only 99% conclusive if you've been abstinent for 6 months. It is our goal to help our users stay educated about safe and responsible ways to connect with each other, and how to manage their risks if they have intimate relations which might have exposed them to any possible sexually transmitted infection.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p>TrickTrackr is first and foremost an answer to a need in the adult community. We believe that it is the obligation of responsible adults to keep inventory of their possible exposures to any sexually transmitted infection in order to properly limit their transmission to others. It is because of this belief that we commit to providing our service for free to anyone in the world regardless of sex, religion, orientation or country. Everyone deserves the opportunity to use TrickTrackr. The basic version will always be free.</p>

This screen will change slighty in the final draft</div>
<p>The sample screen shows you what it would look like if you left all the default options blank. If all you wanted to do was to track that you had a date with someone, then you click Save and you're done. This would be a total of two clicks, so even someone on the go can get back to it later.</p>
<p>You can use the ""Track"" button to see your dates, how many people you've dated, and when you were with them. The ""Test"" button will help you find a community center where you can get tested, or allow you to log the results of your test.</p>
<p>We plan to add a ""Tips"" button to help users educate themselves using quizzes and other informational documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Why I Need Your Help</strong></p>
<p>I've taken some time already to talk to the community in small focus groups to get a sense of what people would want from this program. It's become very clear that there is a demand for this kind of project, but more importantly, people need this kind of application. The longer we wait to get this started, the more people will be in the dark about the risks they are exposing themselves to, and the community will have to resort to using applications which glorify conquests, instead of encouraging responsible actions. It's become clear to me, that our community needs this program now, and I shouldn't delay any longer.</p>
<p>I'd like to ask for your help with funding so I can finish the application by programming it on a full-time basis, instead of when I can get around to it. By using a project planner I've been able to estimate that the basic version would require at least a month (probably more) of my full time attention to get it working the way it should. I'd like more time to perfect it and add all the features that everyone has asked for, but that can't happen until the first basic version is released.</p>
<p><strong>What Are The Funds For?</strong></p>
<p>Most of the funds I'm asking for is to pay the developer, that's me, to be able to work on this full time. I'm only asking for $1800, however, $3200 is a more realistic number if I truly wanted to get a well planned, solidly put together app released in a month. But kickstarter is a place where you ask for a minimum of funding needed, so for now, I'm crossing my fingers that we can get $1800.</p>
<p>We need to pay for focus group meetings, testers, artists, licensing, registrations, marketers, materials, and probably much much more. If we can get $6000, that would set us up long enough that we could execute a plan to make a paid version that would let this grass roots project become self sustaining.</p>
<p><strong>Perks</strong></p>
<p>This is a community project and nothing would make me happier then a group of people anxiously waiting for the app and giving me their feedback on what they think of it. Because it's meant to serve the community I want to make sure that the perks you would get for helping out would actually be interesting to you.</p>
<p>If there's something you want to see as a perk, tell me and I'll find a way to add it!</p>

<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>

</li>
</ul><p>The app works off a local database on your phone, so there's no connection to any kind of server that stores your data. The information that you enter could possibly be of future interest to people working in the health industry to find out what people do and how to prevent further spread of disease. However, it would be a long time before I could even consider collecting that data.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <em>I will never pull any personal data</em> from your app. I have no interest in your contacts and selling that would make me look bad and go against my professional and personal ethics. If I ever do release data collected from your use of the app, I would only collect data on your dating habits, not who you are, how to contact you, or anything of the like.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>What about security? What prevents someone from stealing all my contacts?</strong></p>
</li>
</ul><p>The very first version of TrickTracker will be free and have no log in security. The main reason for this is because I want there to be a measurable difference between the paid version and the free version. Nevertheless, I want people to always have the option to benefit from this app even if they don't pay for it.</p>
<p>If the app becomes well used and further funds come in, then I can upgrade both the paid and the free version with greater security and more features. But for now, the only thing stopping someone from stealing your contacts from the locally stored database is you. You will hold the same responsibility of protecting your TrickTracker contacts that you have protecting your iPhone contacts. Lock your phone.</p>

However, the app is not exclusively built for the gay community. I have many straight friends who are excited to use this app, and we will have options to work their your specific orientation.</p>

Is this just for the gay community or straight community? Who can use it?

The app is for anyone and everyone. However, I will be marketing the app solely through the gay community at first. The needs of the gay community are what first drove me to create this app and it's a community that I have connections with. I know how to market it there. However, the app is not exclusively built for the gay community. I have many straight friends who are excited to use this app, and we will have options to work their your specific orientation.


What's with the name?

In the two years I've been planning for this app I've gone through many different names. This is just the latest one I've settled on. Once we have about a hundred or more people we can start polling for a new name and have the community decide on the official name of the app. Once that is done I'll be renaming all social media and legal documentation to match it.",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

You use it for things like opening boxes, checking inside letters, or being the only person in the room with a knife at family gatherings. You know that those repeatable small tasks are a part of your life, and you embrace them with confidence, knowing that you have the right tool on you. But you don’t always need a large knife for a lot of the daily situations we face. All you need is a compact knife that won’t occupy your precious pocket space and won’t weigh you down during a long day.   We were inspired by nature to create the most unique and useful micro gadget we could to fit your EDC needs. The Pocket Rhino lives up to its name. It is compact enough to disappear in your pocket, and durable enough to go through the toughest of days with you. The Pocket Rhino is the right tool for your daily challenges, and more. It provides reliable cutting time and time again with either it’s incredibly tough D2 steel or its corrosion resistant and durable S35VN steel. It is specially designed for your small but important daily missions such as cutting, slicing, opening, prying, scraping, and fixing anything that comes your way. The Pocket Rhino is the mightiest micro multitool on the market and you won’t want to miss out on it! FEATURES: Razor Sharp Blade:For the blade, we have selected CPM-S35VN and D2 Heat Treated Stainless Steel for their excellent edge retention and superior corrosion and wear resistance. Both blade options are guaranteed to be sharp out of the box. Thanks to their metallurgic advantages, they can maintain their sharpness for a long period of time and they are guaranteed to bring you the success you deserve on your cutting tasks. Also, both steels are easy to resharpen, which is a great advantage for maintaining the blade and keeping it razor sharp. Its small size and chisel tip also make it a quick task to get it back to its factory sharpness. The G10 Pocket Rhino is featured with D2 blade steel and The Titanium Pocket Rhino is featured with CPM-S35VN blade steel.  High Quality Handle Materials:The Pocket Rhino is designed to last and we selected the best materials in the knife industry to ensure that.

<p>We need your help and in

KOINs look like doubloons, shekels, drachmas, and unusual never-seen-before
coins.This is very important –
you can wear your KOIN and share it physically!  You will be buying them
soon over the Internet and in shops and stores, in malls, and at Amazon. <p></p><p></p><p></p>
<p>Cyber KOINs, digital,
are your personal / corporate data havens in our proprietary cloud which we
maintain like Captain Kidd’s buried treasure. 
A KOIN is like a safe deposit box and it is ultra-secure. Seriously so. (Thus
we are not blabbing out in the open about how this is done, but it is more than
just conventional encryption, and we have the professional experience to back
up what we say)  KOINs are not bitcoins, let’s be clear about that. 
No confusion or mistakes, here!  But you can buy, sell and trade KOINs
with friends, partners, anyone, and you can certainly use bitcoins and all the
traditional world currencies like dollars, pounds and euros in your
transactions.</p>
<p>Technically, a <b>KOIN is a
Knowledge Operation Intelligence Network</b> – a big techie phrase that simply
means that it can hold and process an enormous amount of your special, private,
secret, personal / business / fantasy Information. What kind of
information?  Whatever You want to trade, barter, sell, auction.

information in your KOIN, being handled and protected in our special cloud (not
much privacy on the physical KOIN, but there can be special sharable data
there, too). Cannot be touched or Taken by persons or entities that you desire

the KOIN is the commodity, the security, and the currency of the Future. 
Better than what you can do with bitcoins, euros, dollars, yen – they’re only

<h4>We are asking you to fund us $42,000. We
need this for the following:<br/>
• (for the physical side of KOINs) 3D printer, artistic materials and tools,
RFID components, embedded memory components <br/>
• (for the cyber side of KOINs) completing the implementation of our compact  &amp; very secure
server cloud, both software and hardware, including licensing and services <br/>
• advertising and marketing expenses including presentation at a couple of
must-go-to conferences and exhibits upcoming in early 2014<br/>
• few programmers </h4><p></p><p><i><b>Why so little?</b></i></p>
<p>Because
(1) so much is already done on the software side and in the overall
architecture and design, and (2) we are keeping costs way down by using outside
services and partner/subcontractors, such as with the cloud provisions. 
No need for all sorts of equipment and overhead.  Also, (3) we are down to
the real “final stretch,” the “golden mile”.  We are not starting from
zero but we are in the middle of the track and we need the financial equivalent
of a big box of Mars and Snicker bars to keep going until the finish line. 
OK?</p>
<p><i><b>What
are the risks of us not completing the tech work and not “delivering” to You,
the sponsors, or achieving full and stable business-operation status?</b></i></p>
<p>Nil. 
Not virtually, but really.  All the software is either done or is a
straight-shot to completing.  This is not “R&amp;D” – we are done with
that.  What remains is integration, setting things up for web-based
services, starting to produce the physical KOIN devices, and getting our KOINs
into full “circulation.”  We are coming out with something quite novel and attractive and not
subject to being lost in a sea of look-alikes.  and what may emerge out
there that is similar – they will not have what we do on the insides, because
of our cyber security algorithms and other code.</p>
<p><i><b>So
what if we don’t reach the whole $42K funding goal?</b></i> We are confident we will
raise enough so that we will have a very visible and solid Base for the whole
data haven business with KOINS, including the “Private Information Bank and
Trust” operations. We will have enough physical KOINS out there, in physical
and online store that will keep up the momentum.  If we have to go slow
with out KOIN minting and issuance, then we may go slower, but we are Going and
Will Deliver.</p>
<p><i><b>What
if we have more funding than $42,000?</b></i> The initial funding is for launch on a small
scale and we can use extra funds for marketing, production,
distribution, sales and after-sales service and maintaining the cyber security.
We keep you posted further developments from time to time. </p>
<p><i><b>Why
did it take so long if you had started this KOIN-work years ago?</b></i> We really had
to wait and wait until the markets – you – had enough exposure and experience
with social networks and then internet currencies like bitcoins  for what
KOINS and the whole world of LUX - a software architecture and knowledge-based
operating environment behind and underneath them - are all about.</p>
<p>Plus
it helped that finally there are the things we need in the way of certain APIs,
and our own software already done, and today’s smart phones, and RFID
tech.  We had the architecture started in the 90’s and mostly done even
ten years ago.  Now the world is ready for LUX, and for Private
Information Banking with KOINS in your cloud and in your treasure
chest.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/265810/files/20131217084006-THE_PERKS.pdf?1387298406"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/255515/files/20131211130500-Clipboard01-koin4.jpg?1386795900"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3> </h3>
<p><b>NOTE</b>:
KOINs will be operating – functioning in cyberspace, maintain in the cloud data
haven, and ready for business through the Private Information Bank and Trust
offices, and available for public starting on June 21, 2014,
5:51AM ET (10:51AM UTC)</p>
<p><b>What
this means precisely:</b></p>
<p>The
prices will go up between now and then, and you are reserving yours as a
<b>binding pre-release / Christmas / New Year special offer.</b> According to your contribution, and also
your place in line” (i.e.; how soon you are, an early maker-shaker-mover or a
late-comer- coattails- follower), you receive some thing(s) of great and
growing value for your Contribution. </p>
<p>Below
you can see the list of all the KOINs in our eight pre-defined and complete
KOIN Series.  These are the KOIN “minting” that will be conducted, and
with KOINs issued for sale, beginning in 2014, and proceeding semi-annually
through 2015, 2016 and 2017, each Series being released publicly during a
period of three months and in eight different cities worldwide.  </p>
<p>For
each KOIN there is, of course, both a cyber (digital) and physical
component.  Each Series contains one each of eight basic KOIN types. 
Within each Series , each basic type has particular unique cyber and physical
features, and the latter includes a unique name and design.  From one
Series to the next, there will be upgrades and changes in both cyber and physical
features, but there will be a general consistency within each Series.  </p>
<p><b>The
cyber features include differences in ultra secure Kyberos information
allocation and the non-Kyberos high-encryption XOR information allocation, all
within the iBank Cloud Data Haven, as well as variations in the levels of PIBT
services provided to that KOIN.  </b></p><b>
</b><p><b>The
physical designs will reflect both characteristics of the KOIN names, most of
which are drawn from historical currencies from ancient through near-modern
times, as well as unique artistic features that will be determined by the
artists and craftsmen engaged in the minting of the KOINs.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/279499/files/20131226123031-Koins_sq.jpg?1388089831"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/266860/files/20131217192629-Clipboard01-Koin3.jpg?1387337189"" src="""" style=""""/></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/266853/files/20131217191725-I-G_Update_12-13__2__table.jpg?1387336645"" src="""" style=""""/><p></p><br/><p></p><h4></h4><p></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/266844/files/20131217191250-I-G_Update_12-13_3_table.jpg?1387336370"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/266849/files/20131217191528-I-G_Update_12-13_4_table.jpg?1387336528"" src="""" style=""""/></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/266585/files/20131217162555-I-G_Update_12-13__5__table.jpg?1387326355"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/256957/files/20131212060222-1a.jpg?1386856942"" src="""" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);""/><br/><p></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/256954/files/20131212060040-1b.jpg?1386856840"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/256955/files/20131212060128-1c.jpg?1386856888"" src="""" style=""""/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/266259/files/20131217125747-2013_Christmas_card3.jpg?1387313867"" src="""" style=""""/></p>FAQ<p></p><b></b><p></p><p>
[1]<i><b> E-koin is like Bitcoin?</b></i> It may look that way at first. Bitcoins are just
money, and the value can go up and down and sometimes very erratically. 
KOINs contain Information that you create, find, gain, barter, etc.  You
can be highly creative, or just be a broker-dealer.  You and the other party make what is in a given KOIN be a valuable commodity or not.  It can be a
game or be dead-serious, this information and how you package it. 
Physical KOIN is a real thing you can handle and hold.  It has an added
value from being artistically unique and creative.  </p>
<p>[2]<i><b>How does a KOIN work with the
information handling? </b></i> It is done with several interesting forms of cyber
security that you will learn about after you are an owner of a KOIN.  It
all works through the internet, yes, but you can store different parts of any
one of your KOIN’s private information “chest” on not one but several KOINs in
the “Cloud” and – purely as an option, not a requirement - you can safely keep
some valuable information also on your physical KOINs.</p>
<p>[3]
<i><b>Do I need a particular device like an Android or iPhone? </b></i> You need any one
of many devices that can communicate through the internet.</p>
<p>[4]
<i><b>Do I need a special RFID device for my KOINs to work?</b></i>  No.  Your
cyber KOIN does not depend upon RFID or NFC.  Your physical KOIN doesn’t
either, but it has the capability to be a “tagged” item that you or others can
track via the RFID.  We’ll tell you the details when you get on board as an
early ahead-of-the-pack  sponsor.</p>
<p>[5]
<i><b>Can I buy things with KOINS?</b></i> Sure. You can get Cash from your KOINs. But first
you have to do the trade or have one of our licensed PIBT brokers do it for you
(PIBT = Private Information Bank and Trust) </p>
<p>[6]
<b>Can I have someone manage my KOINs like I can have someone handle my
affairs?</b> Absolutely – go back to [5] and then sign up,
contribute, and learn about what you get through the PIBT.</p>
<p>[7]<i><b>
How long does it take to do a “business” with my KOINs?</b></i>  As long as it takes
for you and the buyer / seller to negotiate the Deal in a transaction.  </p>
<p>[8]<i><b>
Can I use KOINs for things like cars, houses, tickets, gold coins, and
baseball cards, whatever? </b></i> Absolutely, nothing is prevented from being used – in any market, anywhere.  You have to either convince the other
party, or barter for something else – what’s the mystery?  This is Basic
Economics 101, for the past 10,000 years at least.</p>
<p>[9]<i><b>
Are there some merchants already signing up for active trading with
KOINs? </b></i> Yes, and we will be announcing the lists before the release of KOINs.</p>
<p>[10]
<i><b>How do KOINs connect up with LUX and LUXworlds, also invented and developed and
brought to the world?  </b></i>They work together, but you
don’t need all of LUX for doing things and having fun and making exchanges with
KOINs.  We’ll be happy to explain LUX more after it comes out in its own
way soon.  Then you’ll understand.  For now, focus on KOINs because
they are going to give you the kind of rapid and stable increase of value that
you missed before. </p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/265737/files/20131217080218-Season_s_greetings.gif?1387296138"" src="""" style=""""/></p>[11]<i><b>
Do I have to pay to do things with KOINs? </b></i> Yes, when it comes to the
business and the super-secure online cloud-based cyber storage.  But if you
are getting KOINs now, early-on, you are getting that either for free or at a
super-discount.<p></p>
<p>[12]
<i><b>What if I lose the physical KOIN or some of the keys and
codes?</b></i>  For providing the anonymity, there is a big cascade of
security, and some things. The cyber side is a little trickier to explain here
in just a few words.  Yes, some things are recoverable, they may take
longer than proving who you are to a TSA agent or fed agent, but things can be
done – or at least tried. The physical KOIN is like jewelry or art – only one
of a kind. Every KOIN totally, totally Unique.  (That’s part of the reason
we call them also “UniKOINs” – “unique” - get it?</p>
<p>[13] 
<i><b>How can I be sure that my money spent in all these KOINy thingies doesn’t go
down the tubes in some kind of crash like what happened with bitcoins and plenty of
other things, internet or not?</b></i>  Well, no guarantees for anything in Life
except that the trip is guaranteed to end, eventually.  But,
realistically, there are plenty of economic values that go up and down and if
you are in at the Start then you can count on things staying worth More than
what you put in at the early stage of Today.</p>
<p>[14]
<i><b>How can I best store my physical KOINs?</b></i>  How would you store “proof”
minted gold coins or a Picasso sketch of<i> My
(Fairly) Hot Lady</i>? Your favorite toy?  </p>
<p>[15]<i><b>
Where are these Private Information Bank and Trust places?  Are they in
different countries? </b></i> <i><b>Are they offshore havens? Can I visit them in
person?  </b></i>Yes, but if we told you where, we’d have to kill you (just
kidding!)</p>
<p>[16]
<i><b>How can we be so sure about the safety of the Cyber KOIN data, when everyone in
the world, from Amazon to NSA to Z-anybody, gets cyber attacked and hacked over
and over? </b></i>See [15].  </p>
<p>[17]
<i><b>What variety can I get with the physical KOIN?  What are my choices? 
Only what you produce? </b></i> No, we like to combine mystery with freedom. 
We have our styles and are designing new ones as we speak. Remember, each KOIN
is Unique.  But for some of the KOIN types, the buyer can do a custom
order, more expensive of course for one or two  than if you order 1000,
but with some “licentious freedom” in every design choice, to be sure!</p>
<p>[18]
<b>Will the “denomination” types change over time? </b> Yes. But all previous
issues and mints will remain valid and even go up in value – just like with
coins, banknotes, stamps and such.</p>
<p>[19]
<i><b>How long before KOINs will really “catch on” and be used by millions? 
</b></i>Well, first of all, we think in terms of billions, not millions.  Hard to
say.  When enough people yawn, open their eyes and wake up, then there is
more and more noise and then the Whole Wide World (WWW) follows. </p>
<p>[20]
<i><b>How can I learn more over time, after I pledge and contribute my money here,
and before I receive cyber and physical forms of my KOINs?</b></i>  We know who
you are and where you are and will keep you posted and happy! (;-))</p>
<p><b>Finally,
being In the KNOW with KOINs can make a big, big difference in more than your
financial future!<i> Initial offering price of each KOIN of series 1 will be announced before the release in June.</i></b> <b><i>Prices will range from $3 - $10 each</i></b>. We will be happy to answer any further questions as we move

e-KOINs are both
physical and purely “cyber” (digital).  Cyber KOIN is a “ data haven”
(treasure chest, vault for information) AND physical Koin is a beautiful,
artistic, and functional object. .
We need your help and in
turn offer you something one-of-a-kind and one-time-only is for jump starting
production and the e-commerce and trading in KOINs worldwide and on a scale and
with a social impact like how cell phones, tablets, and social networks came on
gangbusters across and around the whole world.KOINs come in many shapes and sizes. Physical
KOINs look like doubloons, shekels, drachmas, and unusual never-seen-before
coins.This is very important –
you can wear your KOIN and share it physically!  You will be buying them
soon over the Internet and in shops and stores, in malls, and at Amazon. 
Cyber KOINs, digital,
are your personal / corporate data havens in our proprietary cloud which we
maintain like Captain Kidd’s buried treasure. 
A KOIN is like a safe deposit box and it is ultra-secure. Seriously so. (Thus
we are not blabbing out in the open about how this is done, but it is more than
just conventional encryption, and we have the professional experience to back
up what we say)  KOINs are not bitcoins, let’s be clear about that. 
No confusion or mistakes, here!  But you can buy, sell and trade KOINs
with friends, partners, anyone, and you can certainly use bitcoins and all the
traditional world currencies like dollars, pounds and euros in your
transactions.
Technically, a KOIN is a
Knowledge Operation Intelligence Network – a big techie phrase that simply
means that it can hold and process an enormous amount of your special, private,
secret, personal / business / fantasy Information. What kind of
information?  Whatever You want to trade, barter, sell, auction.
It’s called a “KOIN” because of the “K-O-I-N” meaning, but also because…Information –
properly bundled and packaged, and put on the market for business like anything
else – is The New Currency and Futures Market.  Our motto: “Changing How You Think About Information”Those of You who get in early, at the beginning - You are the
ones who are going to see the biggest gains, fun and profits.  The private
information in your KOIN, being handled and protected in our special cloud (not
much privacy on the physical KOIN, but there can be special sharable data
there, too). Cannot be touched or Taken by persons or entities that you desire
to Keep Out. So,
the KOIN is the commodity, the security, and the currency of the Future. 
Better than what you can do with bitcoins, euros, dollars, yen – they’re only
old-fashioned money!  KOINs are the Real Manifestation of Knowledge is Private
is Personal is Wealth is Power.KOINs
are getting ready for the Market, and We are Offering You an Early Pass.
Better than any Black Friday or Black Monday.  Really. This is your “Gold
Sunday” backdoor entry pass. 
Do
you want to be in at the beginning of the next-gen of private financial security
and also have artifacts (the physical KOINs) - that you can keep as treasures
or talismans, give as gifts, or flash-off to your friends, and also use as
“keys” to get into the deep dark information data haven and the vaults? Or you
just  want to hear about it all from your friends “Wow, I was lucky and
smart – I bought some bitcoins five years ago!”  (or something similar
about a few companies we hear about a lot these past few years.)
Think
carefully.  The KOIN that is more valuable than gold or money - because it
is like money, it is information that can be traded, given, exchanged, bartered
or sold and because it is a work of Art and Beauty.  And with the cyber
side of the KOIN, a true Next-Gen Era where Information, properly packaged and
protected that leads to whole web-wide worlds of LUX. A KOIN is your ticket to
the LUXury Observation Deck.  The V.I.P. bar is open and our service is
beautiful.Other salient points re: KOINs and e-koins.com, luxekoins.com, and the crowdsourcing campaign underway:Can be used by pre-teens to store and share their imaginary worlds with their friends Can be used by teens as another form of ""diary"" or to share fantasy/adventure, personal or gaming, with friends. Can be used to hold collected data that to some may be ""gossip"" or ""trivia"" but to others can be special, intimate, important, or of value in trading, not merely sharing, but trading as in selling, bartering, for other data, or for objects, or money. A family can put all their critical data on it and if a tornado, hurricane, flood, forest fire, etc. forces a rapid evacuation, they have all that ""critical data"" on both our Cloud Server Network but also in the ""palm of their hand"", safely stored. Anyone can have super-critical/valuable/personal data stored on both Cloud and the physical KOIN-device, the ""coin-like"" (galleon-like, doubloon-like) object, which can be protected in their own storage medium (e.g., safe, secure metal/insulated box, their secure EMP-protected box), from not only the usual threats (e.g., theft), but especially(!!!) Secure From EMP Damage. EMP = Electromagnetic Pulse. EMP = coming inevitably to a continent like North America, courtesy of either the Sun or North Korea or Iran. Read up on it at http://amerge.tdyn.org and then understand how a physical KOIN allows you something better than a hard drive, cloud server space, or an ordinary flash-memory stick (USB drive, external hard drive)! Can be used as jewelry, not only as a digital storage.communication / trade medium Can be used among friends, lovers, purely-business traders, total strangers Can be (Will become!) the New Business Card of the 21st Century! Can be used by people of all ages but esp. by the elderly to hold all critical health, pharmaceutical, and other life-support information, such as what prescriptions Grandma is taking since she and her spouse and family probably don't remember or even know! (this is a major problem facing docs today, esp. but not only in ER settings - ""Now what meds are you taking?""  ""Oh, I dunno...some pink ones..."" Can be used to save the things (information) that people most often forget, and with our smart software it can be better organized for their retrieval and use The physical KOIN can be virtually ANY physical design from virtually ANY physical substance Remember that ""KOIN"" stands for and originates form ""Knowledge Object Information Network"" and this gives a deeper sense of what is going on KOIN is NOT!!! ""yet another #$%& bitcoin or the equivalent.""  Bitcoins are internet currency.  KOINs are information objects that can be traded, shared, sold, bartered, invested, and presumably go up in value if the information in them is valuable to any market.  Bitcoins are junk IMHO and so are all the rest of the internet coins/currency.  We will accept bitcoins just like we accept dollars, pounds, euros, yen - but we will discount them because of the financial risk factors and other hidden costs in dealing with bitcoins and such. KOINware and KOINactivity and KOINbusiness is just as much about entertainment and frivolous leisure as it is about serious deep, dark business, or about love in all her myriad forms, or security and safety, or health and medicine, or keeping one's possessions and records organized and intact. Our KYBEROS cybersecurity is not simply ""encryption"" but something more, it is secret, yes, and it is impregnable even to NSA and others, unless one imagines that they can take over a global network of servers in two dozen different countries, not all of which are friendly at all to the USA. MORE DETAILS INCLUDING PERKS
We are asking you to fund us $42,000. We
need this for the following:
• (for the physical side of KOINs) 3D printer, artistic materials and tools,
RFID components, embedded memory components 
• (for the cyber side of KOINs) completing the implementation of our compact  & very secure
server cloud, both software and hardware, including licensing and services 
• advertising and marketing expenses including presentation at a couple of
must-go-to conferences and exhibits upcoming in early 2014
• few programmers Why so little?
Because
(1) so much is already done on the software side and in the overall
architecture and design, and (2) we are keeping costs way down by using outside
services and partner/subcontractors, such as with the cloud provisions. 
No need for all sorts of equipment and overhead.  Also, (3) we are down to
the real “final stretch,” the “golden mile”.  We are not starting from
zero but we are in the middle of the track and we need the financial equivalent
of a big box of Mars and Snicker bars to keep going until the finish line. 
OK?
What
are the risks of us not completing the tech work and not “delivering” to You,
the sponsors, or achieving full and stable business-operation status?
Nil. 
Not virtually, but really.  All the software is either done or is a
straight-shot to completing.  This is not “R&D” – we are done with
that.  What remains is integration, setting things up for web-based
services, starting to produce the physical KOIN devices, and getting our KOINs
into full “circulation.”  We are coming out with something quite novel and attractive and not
subject to being lost in a sea of look-alikes.  and what may emerge out
there that is similar – they will not have what we do on the insides, because
of our cyber security algorithms and other code.
So
what if we don’t reach the whole $42K funding goal? We are confident we will
raise enough so that we will have a very visible and solid Base for the whole
data haven business with KOINS, including the “Private Information Bank and
Trust” operations. We will have enough physical KOINS out there, in physical
and online store that will keep up the momentum.  If we have to go slow
with out KOIN minting and issuance, then we may go slower, but we are Going and
Will Deliver.
What
if we have more funding than $42,000? The initial funding is for launch on a small
scale and we can use extra funds for marketing, production,
distribution, sales and after-sales service and maintaining the cyber security.
We keep you posted further developments from time to time. 
Why
did it take so long if you had started this KOIN-work years ago? We really had
to wait and wait until the markets – you – had enough exposure and experience
with social networks and then internet currencies like bitcoins  for what
KOINS and the whole world of LUX - a software architecture and knowledge-based
operating environment behind and underneath them - are all about.
Plus
it helped that finally there are the things we need in the way of certain APIs,
and our own software already done, and today’s smart phones, and RFID
tech.  We had the architecture started in the 90’s and mostly done even
ten years ago.  Now the world is ready for LUX, and for Private
Information Banking with KOINS in your cloud and in your treasure
chest. 
NOTE:
KOINs will be operating – functioning in cyberspace, maintain in the cloud data
haven, and ready for business through the Private Information Bank and Trust
offices, and available for public starting on June 21, 2014,
5:51AM ET (10:51AM UTC)
What
this means precisely:
The
prices will go up between now and then, and you are reserving yours as a
binding pre-release / Christmas / New Year special offer. According to your contribution, and also
your place in line” (i.e.; how soon you are, an early maker-shaker-mover or a
late-comer- coattails- follower), you receive some thing(s) of great and
growing value for your Contribution. 
Below
you can see the list of all the KOINs in our eight pre-defined and complete
KOIN Series.  These are the KOIN “minting” that will be conducted, and
with KOINs issued for sale, beginning in 2014, and proceeding semi-annually
through 2015, 2016 and 2017, each Series being released publicly during a
period of three months and in eight different cities worldwide.  
For
each KOIN there is, of course, both a cyber (digital) and physical
component.  Each Series contains one each of eight basic KOIN types. 
Within each Series , each basic type has particular unique cyber and physical
features, and the latter includes a unique name and design.  From one
Series to the next, there will be upgrades and changes in both cyber and physical
features, but there will be a general consistency within each Series.  
The
cyber features include differences in ultra secure Kyberos information
allocation and the non-Kyberos high-encryption XOR information allocation, all
within the iBank Cloud Data Haven, as well as variations in the levels of PIBT
services provided to that KOIN.  
The
physical designs will reflect both characteristics of the KOIN names, most of
which are drawn from historical currencies from ancient through near-modern
times, as well as unique artistic features that will be determined by the
artists and craftsmen engaged in the minting of the KOINs.FAQ
[1] E-koin is like Bitcoin? It may look that way at first. Bitcoins are just
money, and the value can go up and down and sometimes very erratically. 
KOINs contain Information that you create, find, gain, barter, etc.  You
can be highly creative, or just be a broker-dealer.  You and the other party make what is in a given KOIN be a valuable commodity or not.  It can be a
game or be dead-serious, this information and how you package it. 
Physical KOIN is a real thing you can handle and hold.  It has an added
value from being artistically unique and creative.  
[2]How does a KOIN work with the
information handling?  It is done with several interesting forms of cyber
security that you will learn about after you are an owner of a KOIN.  It
all works through the internet, yes, but you can store different parts of any
one of your KOIN’s private information “chest” on not one but several KOINs in
the “Cloud” and – purely as an option, not a requirement - you can safely keep
some valuable information also on your physical KOINs.
[3]
Do I need a particular device like an Android or iPhone?  You need any one
of many devices that can communicate through the internet.
[4]
Do I need a special RFID device for my KOINs to work?  No.  Your
cyber KOIN does not depend upon RFID or NFC.  Your physical KOIN doesn’t
either, but it has the capability to be a “tagged” item that you or others can
track via the RFID.  We’ll tell you the details when you get on board as an
early ahead-of-the-pack  sponsor.
[5]
Can I buy things with KOINS? Sure. You can get Cash from your KOINs. But first
you have to do the trade or have one of our licensed PIBT brokers do it for you
(PIBT = Private Information Bank and Trust) 
[6]
Can I have someone manage my KOINs like I can have someone handle my
affairs? Absolutely – go back to [5] and then sign up,
contribute, and learn about what you get through the PIBT.
[7]
How long does it take to do a “business” with my KOINs?  As long as it takes
for you and the buyer / seller to negotiate the Deal in a transaction.  
[8]
Can I use KOINs for things like cars, houses, tickets, gold coins, and
baseball cards, whatever?  Absolutely, nothing is prevented from being used – in any market, anywhere.  You have to either convince the other
party, or barter for something else – what’s the mystery?  This is Basic
Economics 101, for the past 10,000 years at least.
[9]
Are there some merchants already signing up for active trading with
KOINs?  Yes, and we will be announcing the lists before the release of KOINs.
[10]
How do KOINs connect up with LUX and LUXworlds, also invented and developed and
brought to the world?  They work together, but you
don’t need all of LUX for doing things and having fun and making exchanges with
KOINs.  We’ll be happy to explain LUX more after it comes out in its own
way soon.  Then you’ll understand.  For now, focus on KOINs because
they are going to give you the kind of rapid and stable increase of value that
you missed before. 
[11]
Do I have to pay to do things with KOINs?  Yes, when it comes to the
business and the super-secure online cloud-based cyber storage.  But if you
are getting KOINs now, early-on, you are getting that either for free or at a
super-discount.
[12]
What if I lose the physical KOIN or some of the keys and
codes?  For providing the anonymity, there is a big cascade of
security, and some things. The cyber side is a little trickier to explain here
in just a few words.  Yes, some things are recoverable, they may take
longer than proving who you are to a TSA agent or fed agent, but things can be
done – or at least tried. The physical KOIN is like jewelry or art – only one
of a kind. Every KOIN totally, totally Unique.  (That’s part of the reason
we call them also “UniKOINs” – “unique” - get it?
[13] 
How can I be sure that my money spent in all these KOINy thingies doesn’t go
down the tubes in some kind of crash like what happened with bitcoins and plenty of
other things, internet or not?  Well, no guarantees for anything in Life
except that the trip is guaranteed to end, eventually.  But,
realistically, there are plenty of economic values that go up and down and if
you are in at the Start then you can count on things staying worth More than
what you put in at the early stage of Today.
[14]
How can I best store my physical KOINs?  How would you store “proof”
minted gold coins or a Picasso sketch of My
(Fairly) Hot Lady? Your favorite toy?  
[15]
Where are these Private Information Bank and Trust places?  Are they in
different countries?  Are they offshore havens? Can I visit them in
person?  Yes, but if we told you where, we’d have to kill you (just
kidding!)
[16]
How can we be so sure about the safety of the Cyber KOIN data, when everyone in
the world, from Amazon to NSA to Z-anybody, gets cyber attacked and hacked over
and over? See [15].  
[17]
What variety can I get with the physical KOIN?  What are my choices? 
Only what you produce?  No, we like to combine mystery with freedom. 
We have our styles and are designing new ones as we speak. Remember, each KOIN
is Unique.  But for some of the KOIN types, the buyer can do a custom
order, more expensive of course for one or two  than if you order 1000,
but with some “licentious freedom” in every design choice, to be sure!
[18]
Will the “denomination” types change over time?  Yes. But all previous
issues and mints will remain valid and even go up in value – just like with
coins, banknotes, stamps and such.
[19]
How long before KOINs will really “catch on” and be used by millions? 
Well, first of all, we think in terms of billions, not millions.  Hard to
say.  When enough people yawn, open their eyes and wake up, then there is
more and more noise and then the Whole Wide World (WWW) follows. 
[20]
How can I learn more over time, after I pledge and contribute my money here,
and before I receive cyber and physical forms of my KOINs?  We know who
you are and where you are and will keep you posted and happy! (;-))
Finally,
being In the KNOW with KOINs can make a big, big difference in more than your
financial future! Initial offering price of each KOIN of series 1 will be announced before the release in June. Prices will range from $3 - $10 each. We will be happy to answer any further questions as we move
along The creator Dr. D says""This needs to be brought to the attention of people in many fields because of the way people can store very critical information in the physical Koin device and also have it secure and un-tamperable on the Cloud. This can be a lifesaver as well as something for fun and entertainment and profit. People in emergency services, medicine, law enforcement, service to the elderly – they need to know about and support KOINs so that we can supply them to, well, nearly everybody.""e-Koins can lead to dates, friendships, and seriously well-matched RelationshipsYou can put whatever you want on your e-Koin. You can have part of that in the customized, personalized physical Koin that you can give to a friend or prospective mate, or even trade among friends. You can start up a chat with someone over an e-Koin - far better than sitting and just texting from your phones to the person across the table or room!e-KOINS can be used for health records and esp. in emergenciesLiterally everyone can benefit from having some key data in the physical KOIN on in what is stored on the Cloud Server. This does not have to be ""personal"" data but can be the key hints and clues that a person needs to remember. Certainly it can include current and recent medications!

<li>I spent half my time messing around with margins, font sizes and colors in Word instead of actually getting work done<br/>
</li>
<li>Word has a bajillion options, only two or three of which we all care about, and I have to go hunting for them every time<br/>
</li>
<li>I needed something that would allow me to write across many computers, and still access the same data<br/>
</li>
<li>I also wanted easy sharing of whatever I wrote across many different websites (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), and not just to other users of the service<br/>
</li>
<li>I hate logins (and I'm sure you do too!).<br/>
</li>
<li>Many services require people to make accounts in order to view things I've shared with them, which is insane<br/>
</li>
<li>Images need to be simple to put in<br/>
</li>
<li>Not all of my family members are computer savvy, but, I still want to be able to share notes and images with them and they shouldn't have to create accounts, or navigate a complex interface<br/>
</li>
<li>I didn't want an application just to take notes; it had to be usuable for writing long pieces as well</li>
<li>The application had to be extremely user friendly, yet it cannot compromise my productivity in any way</li>

Who am I?
I'm Dhaivat Pandya. I am in the ninth grade, and I love to develop software that makes lives easier.


Demo
Check out a demo of NimbleNotes in action right here!
(But, before that, please read the rest of the document) 

Why NimbleNotes?
NimbleNotes is being created because of problems that I face (and you probably face, too), and here they are:



I spent half my time messing around with margins, font sizes and colors in Word instead of actually getting work done

Word has a bajillion options, only two or three of which we all care about, and I have to go hunting for them every time

I needed something that would allow me to write across many computers, and still access the same data

I also wanted easy sharing of whatever I wrote across many different websites (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), and not just to other users of the service

I hate logins (and I'm sure you do too!).

Many services require people to make accounts in order to view things I've shared with them, which is insane

Images need to be simple to put in

Not all of my family members are computer savvy, but, I still want to be able to share notes and images with them and they shouldn't have to create accounts, or navigate a complex interface

I didn't want an application just to take notes; it had to be usuable for writing long pieces as well
The application had to be extremely user friendly, yet it cannot compromise my productivity in any way



I realized slowly that there was nothing that satisfied all of these criteria. So, I set out to develop something for myself. 

I got a prototype working, and it solved a lot of these problems for me, and I wanted to take it further because I realized that these problems were common and needed to be solved. I called the solution NimbleNotes. NimbleNotes does these really, really well:



Beautiful, well thought out interface
It is INCREDIBLY easy to use
Keeps the writer extremely productive
Only the stuff you need, no cruft
All the stuff's in the cloud; you can access it from anywhere!
No logins
Despite having no logins, it keeps track of your notes for you
Images are as simple as drag and drop or copy and paste, no uploading and hunting for files. Images are central to the application, not just something tacked on.
Two click sharing on Facebook, Twitter and Email

Despite trying its best to be perfectly usable to everyone (for both reading other's notes and writing your own), it doesn't weigh you down in productivity








Here's a demo, right here!


To turn this prototype into an amazing and unique product that will reach your hands, we need *your* help. 


Firstly, we want to create mobile apps for the iPhone, the iPad, Android and Windows Phone 7 so you can write wherever you are, and then be able to pick up on it later. 

We also need some software to get the website perfect for your consumption (like drawing, password-protected notes, etc.), and we need a scalable hosting provider so we can keep NimbleNotes on the air, all the time. 

We'll also have several themes by launch, many of which are dark text on light background.

And, of course, we need trademarks and a bunch of other legal stuff that's required.

So, as a list:


A Mac

Some software licenses

Testing hardware

Apple developer ID

Legal stuff



After crunching some numbers, we've come out to the minimum cost of $4100. 

Please pledge, so you can use and enjoy the awesome NimbleNotes!
And, pass on the word!

Most of current debt tracking apps work as a private, non-social list. If you add a debt, your debtor doesn't even know it - you track it just for yourself. There are some alternatives that offer exchanging transactions with your friends, but they don't offer you an option to verify incoming debts in any way - they just magically appear in your profile.

You can either accept them or, if you believe your friend is mistaken, you can reject them (optionally providing a reason). This way when you look at the debt ""<i>beer at the bar</i>"" that is 3 months old, you don't need to remember the whole situation. If the debt's status is <i>accepted </i>it means that you have already reviewed this one and found it correct, so no need to dwell on it again.

Some time ago we came up with an idea to make this device more comfortable, precise and quiet. None of the solutions offered on the market met our expectations, so we decided to act on our own. We wanted to create something simple and elegant, yet practical, that matches the smart design of other Apple products.
 And here is our minimalist mousepad inspired by the iconic style of Dieter Rams.The idea behind our product is quite simple: the combination of a refined mousepad and a special mouse add-on makes friction minimal and gives the impression of the mouse “floating” on the surface of the pad. Sometimes it doesn't go smoothly...
 
 
 Detailed design and materials make all the difference. 
 Clean and simpleMinimalist design perfectly matches Mac computers.Premium materials No compromises on quality. We carefully select the materials used.Special coatingThe tactile coating is fully compatible with the Magic Mouse. 
 Modern minimalism Laser-cut steel sheet coated with nano-ceramic conversion layer. Finished using the sputtering method. Effect: resistance to abrasion and UV radiation.Discreet branding - no logo on gliding surface. Subtle base Beautiful light-grey foam with anti-slip properties. 
 PureShape mousepad and SmartSlider add-on are a dream team for all problems encountered when working with the Apple Magic Mouse all day.

<p>Hi I'm Orpheus, the creator of <strong>Rhyme Coach</strong>. I'm a regular guy who wanted to give everyone the power to learn how to rhyme, record and share cool videos with their friends, and have an awesome time in the palms of their hands. So I learned to code and built the app myself. I hope that you'll enjoy and support what I've created for you!</p>
<h2><strong>What is Rhyme Coach?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Rhyme Coach is an app that allows you to record videos of yourself rhyming over original beats, and share them instantly with your friends.</strong> That's cool because <em>there's no other app that does that</em>. But the COOLEST part about Rhyme Coach is the <strong>Rhyme Engine</strong> which <strong><em>teaches you to freestyle rhyme </em></strong>(create hip hop songs on the spot) by providing you with an endless stream of rhyming words and phrases.</p>
<p>You learn by ascending through 3 levels of difficulty that use <strong>Rhyme Theory</strong>, a process that embeds rhymes in your mind. If you already know how to rhyme, the more difficult levels will help you to practice and improve your skills.</p>
<p>In short, it's both a revolutionary social music video recording studio that teaches you a cool skill, and an awesome party game.</p>
<p><strong>You've been to the app store, so you know that THERE IS NO APP LIKE RHYME COACH OUT THERE!</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Inspiration on a Napkin</strong></h2>
<p>After co-founding a creative online community of people who shared original videos of themselves rhyming, I was blown away to see how many average people wanted to learn to rhyme and enjoyed sharing their videos with friends.  I also encountered countless serious artists who needed an easier way to express themselves through their art online. I wanted to make it simple for both the pros and the novices to learn to rhyme/sharpen skills, and record &amp; share their videos with friends.</p>
<p><strong>I came up with the idea for Rhyme Coach while out at night with friends and sketched out the app on a napkin</strong>. After learning how many tens of thousands of dollars it would cost to hire a developer I decided to learn how to do it myself. It took 6 months of day and night effort, coding, testing, and designing, and today the app is a reality. </p>
<p><img alt=""Rhyme Coach - Napkin to App"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/oodSI.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Before and After""/></p>
<h2><strong>Rhyme Engine </strong></h2>
<p>The proprietary <strong>Rhyme Engine</strong> is at the center of what makes Rhyme Coach work. </p>
<p>When people learn how to freestyle rhyme they listen to a beat with their friends and throw words out at each other to rhyme with. This can be tough to do for a beginner! Rhyme Coach's proprietary Rhyme Engine generates an endless, continuous stream of rhymes that both a pro and a novice can use to freestyle rhyme on the spot. </p>
<p>The Rhyme Engine will provide you with a prompt word and a rhyme list. In the first example below, the prompt word is ""Grind"", and there are 5 rhyming phrases below it to help you to rhyme. The Rhyme Engine automatically syncs up to the beat to provide you with fresh rhymes at an appropriate interval. </p>
<p>The Rhyme Engine works differently depending upon the difficulty level you set:</p>
<h3>
<strong>On LEVEL 1</strong> the RHYME ENGINE gives you rhyming phrases that you can read to the rhythm until you're comfortable enough to get creative and add your own flair.</h3>
<p><img alt=""Rhyme Coach - Level 1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/pSQbR.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""LEVEL 1""/></p>
<h3>
<strong>On LEVEL 2</strong> the RHYME ENGINE gives you only rhyming words, which is more challenging and allows you to be more creative.</h3>
<p> <img alt=""Rhyme Coach- Level 2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/MaZcT.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""LEVEL 2""/></p>
<h3>
<strong>On LEVEL 3</strong> the RHYME ENGINE gives you only prompt words, so that you can completely freestyle through your video.</h3>
<p><img alt=""Rhyme Coach - Level 3"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/9a9KP.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""LEVEL 3""/></p>
<h2><strong>Rhyme Theory</strong></h2>
<p>Rhyme Coach uses Rhyme Theory, a <strong>3 step neuro-linguistic process</strong> that will teach you to freestyle if you're a beginner, or sharpen your skills if you're advanced.</p>
<p>    <strong>1. Embedding: </strong>Embed rhyme families and anchor phrases in your mind.</p>
<p><strong>     2. Association: </strong>Associate rhyme families and anchor phrases to rhyme.</p>
<p><strong>     3. Freestyle: </strong>Randomly access rhyme families and anchor phrases at will.</p>
<p>Each of the 3 levels of difficulty on Rhyme Coach correspond to a step in Rhyme Theory.</p>
<h2><strong>Recording &amp; Sharing</strong></h2>
<p>Rhyme Coach is easy and intuitive to use. To record, you just hit a button and the app automatically records video for you. </p>
<p><img alt=""Rhyme Coach - Tap to Rhyme"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/VRJay.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Tap to Rhyme""/><img alt=""Rhyme Coach - Recording"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/ErsNv.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Recording""/></p>

<p><img alt=""Rhyme Coach - Share"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/10qsZ.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Share""/></p>
<h2><strong>Music</strong></h2>
<p>Rhyme Coach allows you to select from a stylistically diverse catalogue of beats to rhyme on. There's something for everyone, and with the touch of a button you can preview or load the beat. </p>
<p>Rhyme Coach features beats from <strong>Grammy Award Winning Super Producer, </strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omen_(music_producer)"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Omen</strong></a>, who's worked with Drake, Lil' Wayne and Ludacris. </p>
<h2><strong>You Will Make the Difference</strong></h2>
<p><strong>You have to power to help take Rhyme Coach to the finish line.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finishing the iPhone App: </strong>I will hire a co-developer on a short term basis to assist me with backend technical quality assurance so that the iPhone app is the perfect possible product, and so that all of you will have a phenomenal user experience. <strong>Rhyme Coach can only become a reality with your help to get this professional assistance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Android Version:</strong> I taught myself to program for the iOS, so I'll need to hire and work with an expert Android developer to help me translate Rhyme Coach into an Android version for all of you out there with Android phones. <strong>With your help Rhyme Coach will also be available on Android in no time!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>I've done all that I can on my own, and with your help Rhyme Coach will be perfected and available for everyone to enjoy!</strong></h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Brandon and I've created Print To Point, a service that will provide convenient printing and entrepreneurship for anyone, including college students. </li>
<li>Print To Point is a peer-to-peer print-sharing company that provides safe and secure access to printing capabilities anywhere.</li>
<li>Backers will be able to help launch the mobile application for iOS and Android devices. I've already done the ground work and created the wireframing. We are months away from becoming available in app stores.</li>

<p><strong>THE BREAKDOWN</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Print To Point hires <strong>Print Agents </strong>(contractors with mobile printers and printing materials stored in backpacks, purses, bags, etc.) who are located throughout various cities.  </h3>

<p> </p>
<h3>The concept uses a cloud-based application in which potential clients, aka c<strong>ustomers, </strong>can upload and print various documents or photos via the Print To Point app, as either a pick-up or delivery preference.</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539905515/r5yv0f7vh0uuvmndwqsf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>(Screen shot above is an example. Taco Bell is not affiliated with the product.)</p>
<p>Once a <strong>Customer </strong>is ready to print, he or she can meet the closest <strong>Print Agent</strong> to their location OR have their document(s) delivered to them at their location.</p>

<p><strong>Print Agents</strong> are easily accessible inside the app and are recognizable with Print To Point logos on backpacks, cars,T-Shirts, and/or hats, including profile pictures within the app.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary

My name is Brandon and I've created Print To Point, a service that will provide convenient printing and entrepreneurship for anyone, including college students. 
Print To Point is a peer-to-peer print-sharing company that provides safe and secure access to printing capabilities anywhere.
Backers will be able to help launch the mobile application for iOS and Android devices. I've already done the ground work and created the wireframing. We are months away from becoming available in app stores.


THE BREAKDOWN

Print To Point hires Print Agents (contractors with mobile printers and printing materials stored in backpacks, purses, bags, etc.) who are located throughout various cities.  

 
The concept uses a cloud-based application in which potential clients, aka customers, can upload and print various documents or photos via the Print To Point app, as either a pick-up or delivery preference.

(Screen shot above is an example. Taco Bell is not affiliated with the product.)
Once a Customer is ready to print, he or she can meet the closest Print Agent to their location OR have their document(s) delivered to them at their location.

Print Agents are easily accessible inside the app and are recognizable with Print To Point logos on backpacks, cars,T-Shirts, and/or hats, including profile pictures within the app.

In a nutshell, Print To Point is your personal document delivery service. Print To Point’s target audience includes college students, businesses, travelers, entertainers, professionals, etc.—virtually anybody who may need printing at their fingertips. Have you ever run out of ink, paper, or you just don't own a printer at all? Print To Point is here to save the day.

Not only will this app make printing documents easy for anyone, It will also provide opportunity for individuals, including college students, to make money while attending classes on campuses or various locations as Print Agents.
Currently, printing is stationary and is only accessible by traveling to a location such as FedEx and/or other print labs. Now printing comes to you via Print to Point, an app and website that is very user-friendly.

<p><b>ABOUT OUR PURPOSE</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I am Armen Jaghatspanyan, resident of Armenia. I am an engineer. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">It is known that internal combustion engines are used for
constructing vehicles. I invented a new type of internal combustion rotary-piston
engine and got a patent for it. It is a very economic engine which consumes too
much less fuel than existing engines and, accordingly, emissions of pollutants
are less. We need investments to create real working models (prototypes) of this engine.
It's the first step of our long way in making better world. We sent proposals to several investors asking to help us in construction of models. But  most of them want to see quick results, which is practically not possible. It takes time and resources.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0.06em;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/138452/files/20131017085010-Image7.jpg?1382025010"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span><p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">We do not want you to overload You by detailed technical information. Jast a notice that the principle of working of new engine is based on principle of working of Wankel engine which is a great invention created by Walter Freude and Felix Wankel. Unfortunately the Wankel rotary engine did not show clear advantages over piston internal combustion engine and also had notable shortcomings, which are holding back the massive use of these engines in the industry. But a potentially wide range of possible design solutions provide a wide field of engineering searches. So after a long theoretical research I found that the new engine fixes disadvantages of Wankel engine, providing high efficiency.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0.06em;""> Just imagine a car
with this engine, which uses more than two times less fuel and almost does not
pollute the atmosphere!</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><b>THIS
CAMPAIGN IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT FOR US</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It's several months that we (people who support me, my
family and I) look for investors to do this job. But the idea seems so
unbelievable  to them that many of our requests
are left unanswered. People just do not give us a chance to present an evidence
such as calculations, drawings, descriptions, or finally the whole patented
document. So I hope that our campaign will bring us the desired result because a
little below I will represent to our future funders what invention it is, how
it can work, what changes and improvements can it bring to humanity.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>HOW MUCH
FUNDS DO WE NEED, WHAT FOR AND WHAT WILL WE DO</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">To achieve our first goal, creating prototypes (models) of engine, we
need 100000$. By the truth this amount is not big, comparing with the job that
we will do. According to my calculations the amount will be enough to construct
few working models of new engine. I need the working model-prototypes to test and prove that it is a real,
working, useful invention. In nearest future we will need a cooperation in fields of
mechanical engineering and energetics. Let me give more specific
information in next title.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>SOME
INFORMATION ABOUT ENGINES AND THEIR COMPARISON</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Modern internal combustion engines have 22-28% efficiency,
moreover, the high percentage concerns to diesel engines, and the low
percentage concerns to gasoline  engines.
Car producers make marketing tricks which form a wrong opinion about the efficiency
of internal combustion engine, identifying following concepts: ""engine
efficiency"" and ""vehicle efficiency"". So before searching in
internet about information above, remember that ""engine efficiency""
and ""vehicle efficiency"" are different concepts. I mention this
because I found such controversial articles in internet which confuse real and
false numbers. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Modern hybrid cars have about 40% efficiency. But hybrid
cars use not only an internal combustion engine, but also an electric
motor-generator and a powerful accumulator. Mentioned 40% efficiency is due to
motor-generator and accumulator. Car producers introduce this as
an increase of engine efficiency. But during last 40-50 years the efficiency of
internal combustion engine got a real increase of only 2-3%. So the efficiency of internal combustion engine of hybrid cars stays the same 22-28%. Just imagine what effect we able to get replacing the hybrid car's engine to a new, which has  the same power but consumes more than 2 times less fuel. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Of course many people may think why to construct a new internal
combustion engine if it's possible to use electric motors.Some information
about electric motors. The usage of electric motors certainly is our future. But
before it's widely usage people must solve problems of getting ecologically
clean electricity in large quantities. Now people get electricity mostly by
nuclear
power stations or by gas, oil or coal burning. Burning of these materials is dangerous
for health. And the nuclear power stations may cause to unpredictable
consequences. Also a problem is the produced energy which must not be less than
vehicles with electric motors need to consume. So there are two important
problems to solve to widely use electric motors: first is the issue of
electricity, and the second are fast rechargeable motors. Accordingly, the widely
usage of electromobiles is possible after 50 or 60 years. This can mean that INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES HAVE A LONG LIFE OF USAGE YET.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">NOW ABOUT THE <b>NEW ENGINE</b>. From
constructive point of view, the new type of internal combustion engine joins to
category of rotary-piston engines. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Currently for transport,
aviation and other industries is widely used the traditional internal
combustion piston engine with a <span>crank connecting rod mechanism.
By several reasons, it doesn’t manage to considerably increase the coefficient
of efficiency of piston engine, which is why the most portion of energy of
expended fuel losses as heat. An alternative to piston engine could be,
so-called, the Wankel engine, which has a number of advantages against
to piston engine. But in connection with the constructional features of the
Wankel engine, it failed to achieve the desired economy of fuel yet. For this
reason, the Wankel engine is not widely used. </span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I have done theoretical
analysis of new engine, based on analytical calculations. There are received
exceptional results, which prove that the technical characteristics of new
engine considerably exceed the characteristics of piston engine and the Wankel
engine. Here is the most important characteristic of new engine: with the same
displacement volume the output torque (power) of new engine is 3.2 times
greater than the output torque (power) of piston engine. It follows that the
new engine, having a 3.2 times smaller displacement volume than piston engine,
will have the same power and consume more than 2 times less fuel for doing the same
work.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><b>IN CASE
IF WE WILL NOT REACH OUR GOAL</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I hope so much that we will reach our goal. But otherwise we
will not surrender. By gathered amount we will construct at least one or two models
of new engine. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">By creating this campaign I want not only find investments,
but also make people to pay attention to this important invention. I believe
this is another important goal which needs to be absolutely achieved. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In any case our contributors will receive their perks. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>FUNDING
AND SHARING OF OUR CAMPAIGN</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Every contribution, even little, is very important for us. Every
cent counts. Sharing any information about our campaign is also very important
and we think it is also a contribution. Tell about us to world. May be You are
not able to make funds for us at this time, but someone else can and he just
needs You to inform about him about our idea. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><b>PERKS</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our contributors will be mentioned in our updates at first. We chose perks very carefully. Though there were two reasons which did not allow us offer deserved and necessary perks to our future contributors. That reasons are: </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">1. our activity, which is constructing few models of new engine ( so we can not offer our contributors something material which concerns to the new engine because we will not make a production, we will do a scientific research),</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">2. very high fees of Armenian postal services, which will compel us pay a high fee for sending a perk equal to amount of donation.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So we found other ways to thank our contributors donated up to 20$. We hope our funders will like it. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Donations 21$ and over will let us work with postal service. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Also contributors donated 100$ and over, periodically will receive mailing about progress of our planned project. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>About 7-10$ from Your contributions we will be spent to ship Your item.</i><br/></span></p>

I am Armen Jaghatspanyan, resident of Armenia. I am an engineer. 
It is known that internal combustion engines are used for
constructing vehicles. I invented a new type of internal combustion rotary-piston
engine and got a patent for it. It is a very economic engine which consumes too
much less fuel than existing engines and, accordingly, emissions of pollutants
are less. We need investments to create real working models (prototypes) of this engine.
It's the first step of our long way in making better world. We sent proposals to several investors asking to help us in construction of models. But  most of them want to see quick results, which is practically not possible. It takes time and resources.

We do not want you to overload You by detailed technical information. Jast a notice that the principle of working of new engine is based on principle of working of Wankel engine which is a great invention created by Walter Freude and Felix Wankel. Unfortunately the Wankel rotary engine did not show clear advantages over piston internal combustion engine and also had notable shortcomings, which are holding back the massive use of these engines in the industry. But a potentially wide range of possible design solutions provide a wide field of engineering searches. So after a long theoretical research I found that the new engine fixes disadvantages of Wankel engine, providing high efficiency.
 Just imagine a car
with this engine, which uses more than two times less fuel and almost does not
pollute the atmosphere!




THIS
CAMPAIGN IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT FOR US

It's several months that we (people who support me, my
family and I) look for investors to do this job. But the idea seems so
unbelievable  to them that many of our requests
are left unanswered. People just do not give us a chance to present an evidence
such as calculations, drawings, descriptions, or finally the whole patented
document. So I hope that our campaign will bring us the desired result because a
little below I will represent to our future funders what invention it is, how
it can work, what changes and improvements can it bring to humanity.


HOW MUCH
FUNDS DO WE NEED, WHAT FOR AND WHAT WILL WE DO

To achieve our first goal, creating prototypes (models) of engine, we
need 100000$. By the truth this amount is not big, comparing with the job that
we will do. According to my calculations the amount will be enough to construct
few working models of new engine. I need the working model-prototypes to test and prove that it is a real,
working, useful invention. In nearest future we will need a cooperation in fields of
mechanical engineering and energetics. Let me give more specific
information in next title.


SOME
INFORMATION ABOUT ENGINES AND THEIR COMPARISON

Modern internal combustion engines have 22-28% efficiency,
moreover, the high percentage concerns to diesel engines, and the low
percentage concerns to gasoline  engines.
Car producers make marketing tricks which form a wrong opinion about the efficiency
of internal combustion engine, identifying following concepts: ""engine
efficiency"" and ""vehicle efficiency"". So before searching in
internet about information above, remember that ""engine efficiency""
and ""vehicle efficiency"" are different concepts. I mention this
because I found such controversial articles in internet which confuse real and
false numbers. 
Modern hybrid cars have about 40% efficiency. But hybrid
cars use not only an internal combustion engine, but also an electric
motor-generator and a powerful accumulator. Mentioned 40% efficiency is due to
motor-generator and accumulator. Car producers introduce this as
an increase of engine efficiency. But during last 40-50 years the efficiency of
internal combustion engine got a real increase of only 2-3%. So the efficiency of internal combustion engine of hybrid cars stays the same 22-28%. Just imagine what effect we able to get replacing the hybrid car's engine to a new, which has  the same power but consumes more than 2 times less fuel. 

Of course many people may think why to construct a new internal
combustion engine if it's possible to use electric motors.Some information
about electric motors. The usage of electric motors certainly is our future. But
before it's widely usage people must solve problems of getting ecologically
clean electricity in large quantities. Now people get electricity mostly by
nuclear
power stations or by gas, oil or coal burning. Burning of these materials is dangerous
for health. And the nuclear power stations may cause to unpredictable
consequences. Also a problem is the produced energy which must not be less than
vehicles with electric motors need to consume. So there are two important
problems to solve to widely use electric motors: first is the issue of
electricity, and the second are fast rechargeable motors. Accordingly, the widely
usage of electromobiles is possible after 50 or 60 years. This can mean that INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES HAVE A LONG LIFE OF USAGE YET.

NOW ABOUT THE NEW ENGINE. From
constructive point of view, the new type of internal combustion engine joins to
category of rotary-piston engines. 
Currently for transport,
aviation and other industries is widely used the traditional internal
combustion piston engine with a crank connecting rod mechanism.
By several reasons, it doesn’t manage to considerably increase the coefficient
of efficiency of piston engine, which is why the most portion of energy of
expended fuel losses as heat. An alternative to piston engine could be,
so-called, the Wankel engine, which has a number of advantages against
to piston engine. But in connection with the constructional features of the
Wankel engine, it failed to achieve the desired economy of fuel yet. For this
reason, the Wankel engine is not widely used. 
I have done theoretical
analysis of new engine, based on analytical calculations. There are received
exceptional results, which prove that the technical characteristics of new
engine considerably exceed the characteristics of piston engine and the Wankel
engine. Here is the most important characteristic of new engine: with the same
displacement volume the output torque (power) of new engine is 3.2 times
greater than the output torque (power) of piston engine. It follows that the
new engine, having a 3.2 times smaller displacement volume than piston engine,
will have the same power and consume more than 2 times less fuel for doing the same
work.

To imagine the working principle of engine, watch our video which includes an animation with describtion.


IN CASE
IF WE WILL NOT REACH OUR GOAL

I hope so much that we will reach our goal. But otherwise we
will not surrender. By gathered amount we will construct at least one or two models
of new engine. 
By creating this campaign I want not only find investments,
but also make people to pay attention to this important invention. I believe
this is another important goal which needs to be absolutely achieved. 
In any case our contributors will receive their perks. 


FUNDING
AND SHARING OF OUR CAMPAIGN

Every contribution, even little, is very important for us. Every
cent counts. Sharing any information about our campaign is also very important
and we think it is also a contribution. Tell about us to world. May be You are
not able to make funds for us at this time, but someone else can and he just
needs You to inform about him about our idea. 


HOW TO
CONTRIBUTE

To make a donation, click the ""contribute now""
button on the right hand side of the screen. Select a perk, or make a
contribution. Thank you so much for Your support!


PERKS

Our contributors will be mentioned in our updates at first. We chose perks very carefully. Though there were two reasons which did not allow us offer deserved and necessary perks to our future contributors. That reasons are: 
1. our activity, which is constructing few models of new engine ( so we can not offer our contributors something material which concerns to the new engine because we will not make a production, we will do a scientific research),
2. very high fees of Armenian postal services, which will compel us pay a high fee for sending a perk equal to amount of donation.
So we found other ways to thank our contributors donated up to 20$. We hope our funders will like it. 
Donations 21$ and over will let us work with postal service. 
Also contributors donated 100$ and over, periodically will receive mailing about progress of our planned project. 
About 7-10$ from Your contributions we will be spent to ship Your item.
Also we hope to get not only contributors, but also good friends during this process.

<h2 style=""margin-bottom:0;font-size: 2.4em;color: #EB651B;"">WHY INDIEGOGO?</h2>
<p style=""margin-top:-0.15em;margin-bottom:0.5em;font-size: 1.5em;line-height: 0.9em;"">Crowdfunding is the best way to verify the idea and make product better.</p>
<p style=""margin-top:0.75em;margin-bottom:0.25em;"">Indiegogo campaign has an unique advantage of supporting innovative and out-of-the-box projects. This platform has very smart community, that not just selects perks, but contributes to the project. We would like to use this advantage to:</p>
<ul style=""margin-top:0.25em;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type: square;padding-left:1em;"">
<li style=""margin-top:0.25em;"">
<span style=""font-weight: 700;"">Validate idea with community</span> - we think SendCard.io is a great project. Before going live, Indiegogo will help us to verify the vision and assumptions.</li>
<li style=""margin-top:0.25em;"">
<span style=""font-weight: 700;"">Receive feedback</span>, that will help us to start with better service, make it easier to use, make it more appealing and enjoyable.</li>
<li style=""margin-top:0.25em;"">
<span style=""font-weight: 700;"">Reduce financial risk</span> - by service presale, we can cover partially cost of infrastructure, web design, programming and UX, offering a fair remuneration to young graphic designers.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-size: 0.5em;""> </p>
<h2 style=""margin-bottom:0;font-size: 2.4em;color: #EB651B;"">RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h2>
<p style=""margin-top:-0.15em;margin-bottom:0.5em;font-size: 1.5em;line-height: 0.9em;"">Every product that uses new technology may face technical or legal challenges, our task is to mitigate them.</p>
<p style=""margin-top:0.75em;margin-bottom:0.25em;"">Team identified three potential sources of risk for SendCard.io project:</p>
<ul style=""margin-top:0.25em;margin-bottom:0.25em;list-style-type: square;padding-left:1em;"">
<li style=""margin-top:0.25em;"">
<span style=""font-weight: 700;"">Cryptocurrency hype</span> - if Bitcoin or Ethereum price will skyrocket, it will be more expensive to store information in these blockchains, resulting with increase in the price of the service. This does not affect Indiegogo backers, who get price guarantee, but will make future of the service questionable.</li>
<li style=""margin-top:0.25em;"">
<span style=""font-weight: 700;"">Time</span> - SendCard.io uses very innovative approach and even though we plan tasks as precisely as possible, we can meet technical obstacles, that can not be foreseen and it could extend delivery time.</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: 700;"">Legal aspects</span> may change, e.g. cryptocurrencies might be delegalized or law might be tightened up (e.g. only banks will have right to use cryptocurrency), so SendCard.io will no longer be able to operate.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-top:0.75em;margin-bottom:0;"">SendCard.io team is aware of related risks and is actively working to mitigate them. In case of seeing the risk of occurrence, we will upfront inform the community. We take responsibility for the project, because we are convinced about its success and we will make our best effort to deliver it according to the promise.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 0.5em;""> </p>
<h2 style=""margin-bottom:0;font-size: 2.4em;color: #EB651B;"">WHAT'S NEXT?</h2>
<p style=""margin-top:-0.15em;margin-bottom:0.5em;font-size: 1.5em;line-height: 0.9em;"">Progress is on track, we put a lot of work into this project so far and we believe in its success on Indiegogo.</p>
<ul style=""margin-top:0.25em;margin-bottom:0.25em;list-style-type: square;padding-left:1em;"">
<li style=""margin-top:0.25em;"">As of 31st of July, we have a solid vision, frontend is ready in 85%, backend is ready in 70% and marketing is well-planned.</li>
<li style=""margin-top:0.25em;"">We believe in the success of Indiegogo campaign and look forward for your support.</li>
<li style=""margin-top:0.25em;"">After finalizing the campaign, <a href=""http://www.SendCard.io"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.SendCard.io</a> will operate commercially.</li>

The technology utilizes features like:



Durable mediumIt is a paper and pen of digital era. Data written in blockchain is persistent and is kept for eternity.




High availabilityData is accessible 24/7 in blockchain network. There is no single point of failure. Additionally, information is automatically backed up on many computers (blockchain nodes), so data is safe.




TransparencyWhen it runs as a public network, it is independent of any corporation or government.

Due to its advantages, blockchain was quickly adopted as a base for cryptocurrencies. Among many implementations available, we selected ones, that operate as public, distributed networks with high reputation:



IOTA

OUR VALUES
We make world-changing blockchain technology available for everyday use.
SendCard is our way to make the world a better and more innovative place:

There are so many creative artists and we want to promote their art and deliver unique graphics to SendCard users.
It is eco-friendly to use digitalized form for permanent storage of important messages, we deliver this opportunity to everyone.
Blockchain is changing the world. To benefit from it, there is no need to develop programming or trading skills. SendCard is a way to get to know incredible possibility with no tech knowledge.

 
WHY INDIEGOGO?
Crowdfunding is the best way to verify the idea and make product better.
Indiegogo campaign has an unique advantage of supporting innovative and out-of-the-box projects. This platform has very smart community, that not just selects perks, but contributes to the project. We would like to use this advantage to:


Validate idea with community - we think SendCard.io is a great project. Before going live, Indiegogo will help us to verify the vision and assumptions.

Receive feedback, that will help us to start with better service, make it easier to use, make it more appealing and enjoyable.

Reduce financial risk - by service presale, we can cover partially cost of infrastructure, web design, programming and UX, offering a fair remuneration to young graphic designers.

 
RISKS AND CHALLENGES
Every product that uses new technology may face technical or legal challenges, our task is to mitigate them.
Team identified three potential sources of risk for SendCard.io project:


Cryptocurrency hype - if Bitcoin or Ethereum price will skyrocket, it will be more expensive to store information in these blockchains, resulting with increase in the price of the service. This does not affect Indiegogo backers, who get price guarantee, but will make future of the service questionable.

Time - SendCard.io uses very innovative approach and even though we plan tasks as precisely as possible, we can meet technical obstacles, that can not be foreseen and it could extend delivery time.

Legal aspects may change, e.g. cryptocurrencies might be delegalized or law might be tightened up (e.g. only banks will have right to use cryptocurrency), so SendCard.io will no longer be able to operate.

SendCard.io team is aware of related risks and is actively working to mitigate them. In case of seeing the risk of occurrence, we will upfront inform the community. We take responsibility for the project, because we are convinced about its success and we will make our best effort to deliver it according to the promise.
 
WHAT'S NEXT?
Progress is on track, we put a lot of work into this project so far and we believe in its success on Indiegogo.

As of 31st of July, we have a solid vision, frontend is ready in 85%, backend is ready in 70% and marketing is well-planned.
We believe in the success of Indiegogo campaign and look forward for your support.
After finalizing the campaign, www.SendCard.io will operate commercially.
The next step in SendCard development is mobile an app.

<h3><b>Why we need
your help</b></h3>
<p>We have been
working on this project for 8 months from a concept to the design that can fit
everyone. </p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.giphy.com/l4hLTOywPboNujCEg.gif"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In order to continue working effectively in this direction we need to
see that our project is useful not only to us but also to the ones we’ve been
developing it for. We want the safe, quality, gentle 3D-printing to be
accessible to all. To each one who backs us we are ready to offer up to 40%
discount off the retail price depending on the purchasing option you choose.</p>
<p>To be
specific, your backing money will go towards the production of plastic parts,
the final finishing of the system, the creation of a tuned up production chain,
a quality control system and last but not least, efficient filter cartridges production.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Help us make this project Open-Source, spread the word.</b></p>

Below you will find specific description of problems and solutions.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3><b>Problems we faced:</b></h3>
<div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>1)<span>  </span>Harmful substances</b></p>
<p>Having 4-10
printers working at once made our modest (20m<sup>2</sup>) room gain
a strong characteristic smell, despite the fact that we were using the “clean”
PLA plastic. The ABS plastic and other materials evolve the much more harmful volatile
matters and particles that can accumulate in your body and in time become the
cause of serious illnesses. Even one non-constantly working 3D-printer can have
a negative impact on health.</p>
<p>At first we
tried out the most obvious way of fighting the harmful emissions – aeration of
the room. Apart from the fact that it’s not the most effective method, the risk
of distortion of the 3D-models being printed increased drastically if the
temperature outside dropped lower than 18<sup>o</sup> C (~65<sup>o</sup> F). In
other words, we had to decide between our health and quality printing without
deformation.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>2)<span>  </span>Deformation of models</b></p>
<p>For us as a
company that provides the 3D-printing service and depends on the stability of
the equipment’s performance it was one of the major issues for a long time. Not
even counting the external impacts, the temperature itself can remain
room-level and still be inadequate for stable printing especially if the matter
concerns deformation-sensitive plastic or a lengthy printing process.</p>
<p>The easiest
solution is to create an enclosed chamber for your 3D-printer from the material
at hand: a box or a bag. However, to seal it hermetically you’ll need to “pack”
the gadget up really thoroughly thus complicating the access to the needed
parts and making it more space-occupying. Plus, you lose the ability to follow
the printing process visually.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>3)<span>  </span>Operating environment</b></p>
<p>In time 3D-printers
tend to accumulate a lot of dust and other particles, which complicates the
maintenance and accelerates the wear. Being the owners of a lot of printers and
having to service them we’ve learnt this first-hand.</p>
<p>Besides,
there’s always the risk of foreign matters, pets or body parts getting inside
during the printing process, which naturally isn’t going to do any good.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>4)<span>  </span>The noise</b></p>
<p>Surely, the
noise of working equipment serves as a source of constant irritation. Depending
on the model, it can be almost imperceptible or it can be rather loud. However,
even the most insignificant noise in large portions can be bad for your health.</p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Solutions we found:</b></h3>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>1) Design</b></p>
<p>The
transparent acrylic plastic panels (2, 3 and 4 mm thick) serve as the framework
for MiniHood. The plastic elements and bracings are printed using PLA plastic. The fans with
filtering elements are placed on the top and on the bottom creating uniform air
circulation inside. The airflow enters at the top and escapes at the bottom
providing maximum filtration of the settling particles.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The
corner parts on the “Box” model hold the panels together making the
construction airtight and inflexible.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The
front handles do the same job for the “Fit” model.</p>
<p>Both models
have air distributors that redirect the airflow away from the build platform
and to the sides creating the proper circulation while not causing any
deformations.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>2) Filters</b></p>
<p>· 
The
entrance filter is a primary strainer protecting from dust, large and medium
particles. It consists of a coal filter and an anti-dust filter. It screens the
internal machinery, thus extending its service life and the gaps between
maintenance works.</p>
<p>· 
The
escape filter is a fine gage strainer that consists of 3 different layers. Such
filters are used for air purification in hospital wards, administrative
buildings, hotels, in food and drug industries. It prevents the emission of the
smallest particles, down to the size of 1-2 microns. It also neutralizes the
smell.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We now consulting with an expert to bring a simple, but efficient filtration materials together, to provide a 60-70% filtration rank. Although our filter will have its limits with ultra fine particles, but in the other hand, anybody will be able to make it by himself. We plan to deal with ultra fine particles in the future, like an addition to the existing system.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>3) Compactness
and mobility</b></p>
<p>Minihood is
easily assembled and disassembled and it doesn’t take up much space.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>When
disassembled, The “Fit” model is a set of one bent and several flat panels.
When assembled it increases the overall dimensions of your printer slightly,
following its contour.</p>
<p>· 
The
disassembled “Box” model consists of several rectangular panels and plastic
parts. When assembled it becomes a confined space with your printer inside.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>4) Operating
modes</b></p>
<p>Minihood
was designed to work with two fan speed modes. Hence you can control the volume
and the speed of the airflow according to the print speed, printing material,
outside temperature or any other factors. You can change the fan’s speed at any
moment.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>5) Affordability
and possibility of finishing</b></p>
<p>One of the
key goals while creating MiniHood was to make it affordable for a large number
of 3D-printer owners. This applies to the cost as well as physical
accessibility, literally:</p>
<p><b>· </b>
MiniHood
costs a few times less than any analogues in the market</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>In
order to let anyone regardless of their location purchase MiniHood while not
spending a fortune on delivery we offer the following purchasing options:</p>
<p>1)<span>  </span>Digital version (blueprints and
models)</p>
<p>2)<span>  </span>Hybrid version (the digital version
+ ready-made filters and electronics)</p>
<p>Upon
purchasing the digital or the hybrid version you are able to finish MiniHood by
adding the elements you need or changing the size and construction depending on
your needs. This makes the design of MiniHood truly versatile.</p>
<p><b>·

<h3><b>The risks:</b></h3>
<p>Several
prototypes of this system have been working at our mini-factory for more than
six months without any problems.</p>
<p>The risks
are low because:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The
design of the electronic components is very simple technically and it’s been
developed and produced under the control of an experienced engineer.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>We
get the materials from a tried supplier with whom we’ve been collaborating for
over a year on various projects (laser cutting, 3D-printing, silicone mould
casting).</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>We
print a lot and have a large printer fleet so we do have the experience needed
for large-scale projects</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>We
have picked out several suppliers for filters and electronic elements so even
if the stock is low we are not expecting any problems with provision – the materials
and components are not that rare.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Despite
all of the above we might still experience some problems as any other project
might. For example, there is a risk of a minor delay in certification, in
production of electronic components and in the supply of the needed materials.
But we will make every effort to minimize the risks and will keep you well

active users of the desktop 3D-printing technology have always wanted to print
more safely and stably while also being able to extend the service life of our 3D-printers
themselves. It all began more than a year ago when the number of 3D-printers at
our factory started to rapidly increase. And the more we used them the more
shortcomings were becoming apparent:
              



                       
The issues
above (You can find specific description below) set us a task of finding a solution. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find a
proper off-the-shelf product (on account of the size, the price and the functional
shortcomings) so, as we weren’t willing to lose neither space, nor money, nor
functionality, we had to create it ourselves. 

And now we’re happy to introduce














MiniHood is
a compact, affordable and effective way of preserving your health, extending
your 3D-printer’s service life and improving the printing quality.

Why we need
your help
We have been
working on this project for 8 months from a concept to the design that can fit
everyone. 


In order to continue working effectively in this direction we need to
see that our project is useful not only to us but also to the ones we’ve been
developing it for. We want the safe, quality, gentle 3D-printing to be
accessible to all. To each one who backs us we are ready to offer up to 40%
discount off the retail price depending on the purchasing option you choose.
To be
specific, your backing money will go towards the production of plastic parts,
the final finishing of the system, the creation of a tuned up production chain,
a quality control system and last but not least, efficient filter cartridges production.

Help us make this project Open-Source, spread the word.




       
Below you will find specific description of problems and solutions.

Problems we faced:

1)  Harmful substances
Having 4-10
printers working at once made our modest (20m2) room gain
a strong characteristic smell, despite the fact that we were using the “clean”
PLA plastic. The ABS plastic and other materials evolve the much more harmful volatile
matters and particles that can accumulate in your body and in time become the
cause of serious illnesses. Even one non-constantly working 3D-printer can have
a negative impact on health.
At first we
tried out the most obvious way of fighting the harmful emissions – aeration of
the room. Apart from the fact that it’s not the most effective method, the risk
of distortion of the 3D-models being printed increased drastically if the
temperature outside dropped lower than 18o C (~65o F). In
other words, we had to decide between our health and quality printing without
deformation.
2)  Deformation of models
For us as a
company that provides the 3D-printing service and depends on the stability of
the equipment’s performance it was one of the major issues for a long time. Not
even counting the external impacts, the temperature itself can remain
room-level and still be inadequate for stable printing especially if the matter
concerns deformation-sensitive plastic or a lengthy printing process.
The easiest
solution is to create an enclosed chamber for your 3D-printer from the material
at hand: a box or a bag. However, to seal it hermetically you’ll need to “pack”
the gadget up really thoroughly thus complicating the access to the needed
parts and making it more space-occupying. Plus, you lose the ability to follow
the printing process visually.
3)  Operating environment
In time 3D-printers
tend to accumulate a lot of dust and other particles, which complicates the
maintenance and accelerates the wear. Being the owners of a lot of printers and
having to service them we’ve learnt this first-hand.
Besides,
there’s always the risk of foreign matters, pets or body parts getting inside
during the printing process, which naturally isn’t going to do any good.
4)  The noise
Surely, the
noise of working equipment serves as a source of constant irritation. Depending
on the model, it can be almost imperceptible or it can be rather loud. However,
even the most insignificant noise in large portions can be bad for your health.
Solutions we found:
1) Design
The
transparent acrylic plastic panels (2, 3 and 4 mm thick) serve as the framework
for MiniHood. The plastic elements and bracings are printed using PLA plastic. The fans with
filtering elements are placed on the top and on the bottom creating uniform air
circulation inside. The airflow enters at the top and escapes at the bottom
providing maximum filtration of the settling particles.
· 
The
corner parts on the “Box” model hold the panels together making the
construction airtight and inflexible.
· 
The
front handles do the same job for the “Fit” model.
Both models
have air distributors that redirect the airflow away from the build platform
and to the sides creating the proper circulation while not causing any
deformations.
2) Filters
· 
The
entrance filter is a primary strainer protecting from dust, large and medium
particles. It consists of a coal filter and an anti-dust filter. It screens the
internal machinery, thus extending its service life and the gaps between
maintenance works.
· 
The
escape filter is a fine gage strainer that consists of 3 different layers. Such
filters are used for air purification in hospital wards, administrative
buildings, hotels, in food and drug industries. It prevents the emission of the
smallest particles, down to the size of 1-2 microns. It also neutralizes the
smell.
We now consulting with an expert to bring a simple, but efficient filtration materials together, to provide a 60-70% filtration rank. Although our filter will have its limits with ultra fine particles, but in the other hand, anybody will be able to make it by himself. We plan to deal with ultra fine particles in the future, like an addition to the existing system.

3) Compactness
and mobility
Minihood is
easily assembled and disassembled and it doesn’t take up much space.
· 
When
disassembled, The “Fit” model is a set of one bent and several flat panels.
When assembled it increases the overall dimensions of your printer slightly,
following its contour.
· 
The
disassembled “Box” model consists of several rectangular panels and plastic
parts. When assembled it becomes a confined space with your printer inside.
4) Operating
modes
Minihood
was designed to work with two fan speed modes. Hence you can control the volume
and the speed of the airflow according to the print speed, printing material,
outside temperature or any other factors. You can change the fan’s speed at any
moment.
5) Affordability
and possibility of finishing
One of the
key goals while creating MiniHood was to make it affordable for a large number
of 3D-printer owners. This applies to the cost as well as physical
accessibility, literally:
· 
MiniHood
costs a few times less than any analogues in the market
· 
In
order to let anyone regardless of their location purchase MiniHood while not
spending a fortune on delivery we offer the following purchasing options:
1)  Digital version (blueprints and
models)
2)  Hybrid version (the digital version
+ ready-made filters and electronics)
Upon
purchasing the digital or the hybrid version you are able to finish MiniHood by
adding the elements you need or changing the size and construction depending on
your needs. This makes the design of MiniHood truly versatile.

If
our campaign achieves the goal of $6000, on the 1st of April 2017
we will make the MiniHood blueprints and 3D-models open-source. So that
literally anyone could use our solution.

By capturing your daily handwritten plan with the Organicer app, you can check, change or mark tasks on the go without carrying a planner with you. Transferring your checklists from paper to phone have never been easier! 




Organicer app works on both - iOS and Android platform.
 


While putting pen to paper will always be appealing, digital calenders are becoming more and more handy. Organicer found the way that serves as a bridge between paper and digital notes. Handwritten notes from the paper planner are transferred to mobile APP with the help of QR codes: Organicer app works on both - iOS and Android platform. A weekly 6.00 AM to 9.30 PM table is here for you to organise your appointments and daily action plan into hourly sections. With a little help of your phone you can take a snap and transfer your appointments into Organicer app. Organicer app will automatically recognize filled spaces and set reminders in your phone. You can always choose how much time before each appointment a reminder should be made.  Each daily layout comes with a checklist to get a more transparent overview of what are your daily must-dos. Either you can use it for shopping, tasks that needs to be tackled, steps in a project etc. You can name the tags yourself.You can create unlimited tags in Organicer app. There are 3 icons under a checklist in a planner’s daily layout. Set tag names for these 3 icons – for example Shopping, Tasks, Projects. If you write down shopping items you need to buy, draw an X across the icon you set for shopping. You can easily edit your lists in Organicer app – either change them, share them with a friend or mark them as done.  There is a blank blacklined space positioned under the date in everyday layout. That is a place for your brainstorming and writing down your thoughts. Taking a snap with your phone will transfer your thoughts into the Organicer app. Storing your notes in the app have many advantages. They are easy to edit, manageable and light to carry since they are in your phone. You can always add more of them directly in your phone.  The best part about Organicer checklists and notes is that they can be instantly shared amongs your friends and family. When a task on a shared list is marked as completed it will immediately notify and update everyone else with the list. Our commitment to make a difference in the world we live in and those coming behind us is manifested in our active participation in causes that protect the environment and empower people around the globe. Considering Ines's background in social work, Sasha's involvement in eco and fair-trade products and their passion for travelling in was inevitable that there had to be a greater value added to the planner. They were amazed by the impact Barefoot College projects have on different layers of everyday life in rural communities in developing countries. In June 2018, Ines and Sasha travelled to Tanzania, East Africa as part of the Organicer research task. They have visited the Barefoot College's educational centre and a village where their project Solar Mama's is active. They also met Mr. Xavier Juncadella, a head coordinator of Barefoot College for East Africa. ""When a dream comes with tennacity, hard work, planning, clear objective and is mixed up with good sould you get Organicer,"" Xavier Juncadella (East African Coordinator - Barefoot College International​)We believe that the liberating power of education can help people take control of their lives and live purposefully and this is the main reason why we support the Barefoot College.    We are a team of 4 friends from Slovenia. Our paths crossed already in teenage years yet our professional lifes merged with the birth of Organicer, in 2017. Ines is a social worker with an artistic soul and David owns a small print shop, is a web developer and designer. David enthraled Ines for graphic design and they started collaborating on various projects. Sasha with his outstanding communication skills, tons of experience in fair-trade projects and a kind soul, fits perfectly to the pair. And then there is  unreplaceable Nika who takes care for organisational means regarding time management and controlling.  Left to right: Ines Mulec, David Sovec (Founders), Nika Starovasnik, Sasha Segula (Team Members) Ines was a full-time student and being a student nowadays demands having a planner. She tried to find the perfect one but soon realised it does not exist. David's working table was always covered in self ad notes and piles of unorganised papers. He as an IT guy, had a total chaos in his office, but had his meetings well organised in his mobile app. They both looked at their needs and realised developing a smart planner would make their lives considerably easier and more productive. With that realisation, Ines's growing designing skills and David's IT knowledge – the idea of Organicer was born.

I could see the writing on the wall: automation was coming and nothing could stop it. Where was the place for human work and innovation? Robots can do anything as long as you have years of development available and a service support system to keep them going. Be that as it may, what makes human work so special?As humans, we learn quickly and can switch from task to task without years of development & very little training.  I started to drive for a ride share service and saw the perfect mechanism for human work to thrive again. The only problem with working with the ride share service was the challenge of the car and license. Barriers were keeping it from being a work solution for everyone.  I thought, “How can this be more accessible to everyone?”I began to try and resolve how we could remove these barriers. This way everyone could have access to work that fit their lives and gave them what they needed to thrive no matter where they were in the world.I realized that the largest area of needed work is the cleaning and maintenance of any given location. It’s a big challenge for businesses and workers. These challenges include:
Businesses have trouble balancing quality, quantity, and value
The tasks at hand aren’t always bountiful
When there are tasks, they’re need to be done effectively and efficiently
There’s also not a set price for this kind of work
Crazy hours 
With all of this, you have a recipe for constant turnover and quality challenges.Welcome to the Fare Wage family.We are so excited to bring technology and people together to change the way the world works!We’re here to put an end to the endless road blocks that keep people from their full earning potential. At Fare Wage we promise that you will only be judged by the quality of your work. That’s why we’ve set up our business with four simple responsibilities:

Task Manager: Company or business hiring. Typically CEO or HR

Task Creator: Upper management

Task Approver: Individual(s) responsible for task being complete

Tasker: You. This role is the human doing the job.
Task Managers, Creators, and Approvers don't have any access to Tasker's personal information.They only see your completed tasks in the area with your user ID number and optional user name. This eliminates any partiality or bias on the part of the company or the quality manager. They simply look for completion and rate the quality.This puts the responsibility on the Tasker. As a Tasker,  strive to always put your best foot forward in your work. Fare Wage will help Taskers with training, basic process and etiquette in every area that you have tasks available.  Once untimed tasks are completed at a company location, more training becomes available to the Tasker. When you complete and pass any new training for tasks in a location, then those additional new tasks become available the next time you're near the same location.This is what makes Fare Wage such a perfect solution. First, we remove the cost associated with interviewing, hiring, and training. Secondly, we reduce overall cost again by using the contractor identification. This frees the company to pay a higher rate per task while still saving them more than half the cost of a full time position. The hourly earning potential of the Tasker is greater, due to the fact that they can complete multiple tasks per hour (one hour x 3 tasks = $45) Yes, individuals make more money, but never has that freedom and wealth been made available to the average worker.  This desire to empower is why we, at Fare Wage, decided to have people fund the launch in their own cities and counties. We want you to see first hand, the change you can create in your life and lives around you.    Taskers are only limited by government regulations and requirements as to the amount of time an individual can work continuously. The goal of Fare Wage is to make it possible for each Tasker to be able to earn 2 to 3 times what a living wage would pay per hour. This will vary depending on the cost of living in your local economy.As far as required work hours -- there are none!  We only require Taskers login once a day to maintain their active status and see how many opportunities are available. Otherwise, you can set your Tasker user status to vacation mode until you’re ready to work again! This way, you can build your work around life instead of building your life around work.Together, let’s change the way the world works!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>As a writer, I've always struggled to make ends meet.  Original work can be a challenge to market, while you're lucky if any of your fanwork catches enough attention to get a commission tossed your way. It didn't take long for me to realize that this wasn't a problem unique to writers.</p>
<p>In fact, it seemed that the more creators I talked to, the worse the problem was. Artists had their work reposted and undervalued, musicians were lucky to get some ad revenue (let alone a sold song), videographers had their ad revenue arbitrarily cut-off as policies changed, and so on.</p>
<p>As I rallied more creators, we began to brainstorm. WritScrib was born not long after, with a plan to help creators earn a living on their work.</p>
<p>Here's some of our launch-day features:</p>
<ul><li>Separate feeds: In addition to your main feed that shows the posts of the people you follow, you can keep an infinite number of tabs open for private messages, tags, and groups. Simply click on the tab that you want to switch to, and that replaces your feed. No more clicking off to other pages or having to re-enter the same search over and over!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497037810/c3m8cwpr1delvay9fe2p.png"" src="""" style=""""/>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Groups: Do you want to talk to people about your favorite subject? Create a group about it! Groups can be public or invite-only. Posts made in the group don't show up anywhere else unless you tag it. It's a perfect way to reduce clutter for your followers while still posting WIPs of your work to your dedicated fans.</li>
<li>Chips: Each Chip is valued at $0.10 USD. If you like a post, you can Chip-In as many Chips as you want. Those Chips go to the user who created that post. Once someone has at least 50 Chips, they can sell them back to the site! $1.10 gets you 10 Chips to spend. If you're looking to support a creator but can't afford $5/month, how about $0.10? Support your favorite creators without breaking your bank account! <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497037886/iqm7ls4cmhkuzzok8dwr.png"" src="""" style=""""/>
</li>
<li>Badges and Emoticons: Show off how many Chips you've earned/purchased! Every 1,000 Chips, you unlock a new badge, and every 5,000 Chips unlocks another 10 emoticons for you to use.</li>
<li>Open Communication: We'll have a public Feedback Group for you guys to send us your complaints and suggestions. If enough people support a post in that group, we'll respond! Have an idea or gripe but don't want to be public with it? Don't worry, you can still e-mail us.</li>
<li>And More!</li>
</ul>
<p>We've already got the website, and we've got the basic design:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495787210/z5qivsivifbzg0ewwter.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>But we can't do this alone. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>Starting up a website of this scale requires a little bit of seed money to get it started. That's where you come in.</p>
<p>We're looking for $15,000 to cover the beta build (and final launch) of the website. This covers putting the website together, a small widget that we need to develop, and start-up hosting costs. We've already got the design out of the way and the rest of the features at a ready-to-implement state. We only need this extra push to get this site launched!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Cost Breakdown</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">$4,000 for site setup and custom plugin costs</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">$7,200 for one year of continued programming support</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">$70/mo + reserve for startup server hosting costs</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus, anyone who chips-in at least $5 will be able to get early access to our site through a closed beta. Higher reward-tiers will net you the opportunity to suggest a feature that you want implemented into the site, a chance to talk one-on-one with someone from our team, and the ability to unlock one of the chip-tiers early!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Busking Online</h3>
<p>Imagine that you are an artist that's grappling with your social media. You have a decent following on Patreon--but that's only bringing in around $100/month, nowhere near enough for you to live off of. You make some Youtube ad revenue, and you occasionally earn a few commissions.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that you create a WritScrib account.</p>
<p>Any doodle, any vent post, any joke that you make could potential get Chips. Someone finds your drawing from 6 months back and likes it? You make some money on it. Someone thinks you made an insightful comment? You make some money on it. This steady trickle of Chips has no cut-off date: once you make a post, it can keep earning Chips until you delete it or disable receiving Chips on it. This means that a dedicated blogger who is actively posting new creative content has a higher chance of earning money, and this pay can only help when added to your other sources of revenue. This puts a real monetary incentive behind maintaining a strong social media presence.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>At this stage, our biggest risks are a lack of funding, and a lack of interest. We've assembled a talented team that can complete the job, but without the means to pay them, that can quickly fall through.</p>
<p>Our second biggest risk comes during testing: if we discover through our beta testing that our costs outweigh our revenue, we may have to revise our strategy by adjusting fees, ads, or donation drives. We'll disclose our costs and revenue during the beta so that our users understand why we're doing what we're doing.</p>
<p>Should we fail to meet our funding goal, we will complete as much of the site as we can before approaching local investors with our prototype.</p>
<p>From speaking to a wide variety of creators, we've found a mostly interested community with a few skeptical voices. We're hoping that interest outweighs skepticism! If people aren't interested, however, we'll open up to the creative community at large for feedback to see what they are looking for in a social network, then revise our strategy to better fit the audience that we want to serve.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>I'm a Broke Artist, How Can I Help?</h3>
<p>We know that many of the people who will be interested in our social network also happen to be the least likely to have spare income. If you can't spare any money for our campaign, please consider sharing it on Tumblr, Twitter, and wherever else! Just don't be too annoying about it.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can come hang out on our <a href=""https://discord.gg/74xBx7W"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">discord</a>. While we can't guarantee that your suggestions will make it into our launch, we can listen and let you know if we have something similar in the works. Or, you can come hang out! We want to remain as open as possible.</p>

However, even after we got rid of the virus we continued to have a poor, spotty &amp; slow connection. We realized that we had outgrown our service and needed to increase our bandwidth and move to a more reliable internet connection. So this month we’re moving our ISP from [ed: ISP name deleted] at 10 Mbps to [ed: ISP name deleted] at 50 Mbps, upgradable to 100 Mbps and at a much lower monthly cost. Thank you for letting me sample this device, it was a big help in identifying our problems and solving them. As a small-to-medium size business owner, I can say this is a very valuable tool that helped us save money and become more efficient."" </i>– Patti G. (VP/CFO) – FL</p><p><i>“I love this device. Now I know exactly which devices are on my network, how it's performing, and when I have trouble with [ed: ISP name deleted] (regularly), I can prove it's THEIR network that is at fault not something in my house.

For those who are curious the device is made up of the following:</p><ul>
<li>Processor: H3 Quad-Core Cortex-A7 ARM </li>
<li>RAM: 512MB DDR3 </li>
<li>Connectivity: 10/100 Mbps Ethernet* </li>
<li>OS: Debian Linux</li>
</ul><p>*Because we are never in the data path AND our testing requires so little bandwidth, we can easily support any speed home network (even 1 Gbps or higher).</p><p><strong>Data Usage:</strong> Our tests are lightweight (about 14Kbps) and run continuously. Over the month the device will consume an equivalent of about one HD movie (less than 5 GB). So if your internet connection has tight caps (e.g., broadband over cellular), you may want to hook up the device periodically to test quality and turn it off at other times.</p><p> </p><h2>How is monitor-io different? </h2><p>The monitor-io device executes performance tests continuously to measure the quality of your internet connectivity using only a negligible amount of network bandwidth. This is done using advanced packet exchange sequences (not pings) that can detect numerous traffic impairments that impact performance -- packet loss, data errors, reordering, high delay variation, etc. We follow several IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) IPPM (Internet Protocol Performance Measurements) workgroup standards. Our methodology is more comprehensive than ping and more specific than speed tests. More information on our methodology <a href=""http://www.monitor-io.com/test-methodology"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p><p>We consider it extremely important to emphasize that we do not use ARP spoofing/poisoning or expect to become your DHCP server.

<p></p>Studies show that less than 10% of us will actually achieve our goals and progress according to our plans each year. That means that 90%+ of us fall short. This is due to a lack of right tools with proper processes or strategies. But this does not mean that we have to become masters of goal-making strategies or planning; if you don't know, then don't worry........... The Focus Planner will do this for you and, with help of this planner, you will reach your destination more easily and happily.<br/>

<p>Wireless keyboards let you choose your input experience. Want to game on the couch? Sure, and you can control compatible home theater devices while you’re there. Need to set up a presentation away from your desk? No problem — just unplug the keyboard and take it along. Wired devices (<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Hexgears+USA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">we launched a few this year</a>) are useful for immobile work and stationary gaming, but you can’t beat wireless flexibility.</p>

<p><strong>Keyboard switches directly affect your keyboarding performance and comfort.</strong> Mechanical switches, which have discrete metal contacts and springs, are better than mushy rubber domes in a few vital ways. Mechanical durability is remarkable; Venture’s Kailh Choc switches are rated for 70 million presses. While you can rest assured that your switches will stand the test of time, there’s something more important to consider.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562101093/sn6pqzqylaaavuy90nyd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Personalization is the key to your satisfaction as a typist or gamer, and mechanical keyboards deliver it.</strong> Three different switch options are available in the Venture — linear (red), tactile (brown), and tactile clicky (white, retooled).<strong> Each imparts a unique fingertip sensation, or form of tactile feedback, and doesn’t need to be bottomed out to activate. This results in slightly faster input, which is good for gaming.</strong> Regular rubber domes are squishy, unsatisfying, and almost always force you to press all the way down. View Venture’s features (below) to learn more and make a Choc switch selection.</p>

<p>Most wireless keyboards are compromised by poor design choices. Some optimize for battery life at the expense of key feel and features. Others alter keys to save space, creating an unfamiliar layout, or use a custom dongle that is incompatible with a range of devices. In rare cases, those trade-offs are worthwhile. Most of the time they’re not.</p>
<p>Nonstandard key sizes and other quirks can slow people down. Most companies fail to recognize that some of us want a familiar layout, which hurts the entire tech ecosystem. We created the 108-key Venture to avoid those pitfalls and innovate.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562101312/ih3mkbntjnd80woyzjux.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The Hexgears X-1 marked our debut in the US; it was also Hexgears’ first Kickstarter. Amazing backers and helpful reviewers pointed out potential changes. Some of the ideas weren’t right for the X-1, which we envisioned as an ultra-portable keyboard. The concept worked well as it was — an X-1 even went to the South Pole on a research expedition.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562102834/yhn0pu0ttjgjscx9r8ra.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Most of those suggestions found a new home in the Venture. Mac keycaps were requested, and they'll be included with every Venture in the final production keyset.  Larger batteries, sculpted keycaps, and new RGB features (like a light ring) were added. Wireless subsystem updates and other tweaks are also complete. Even the manual will be improved vs. the X-1. Read about Venture’s compelling features below.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562102885/xahcqkgq7urvasdrkrlu.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Venture can remember 4 paired devices and switch between them in a couple of seconds — phones, laptops, and more are fair game. This is convenient if you multitask with different devices, as you won’t need multiple keyboards. Venture’s carefully tuned Bluetooth Low Energy chip saves power, offers wide compatibility, and responds quickly while gaming. It operates at the fastest possible polling rate for high performance low latency input.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562103019/q4lpwjfyc904cow5egc3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Dual 2000 mAh rechargeable cells are included with the keyboard (for a total of 4000 mAh). That’s a lot of power — more than most smartphones. With RGB lighting disabled, the keyboard lasts 4 weeks with 2-3 hours of use per day. That runtime can even be extended.</p>
<p><strong>Venture’s batteries are user-replaceable via a compartment on the back of the keyboard. </strong>You can swap in standard AA cells or compatible rechargeable units. This increases endurance on the go and allows you to replace batteries if they degrade.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562103107/kuqjlh6rhlg1flcesv8f.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The Venture includes per-key RGB lighting, which is configured onboard. This ensures functionality with all keyboard-compatible Bluetooth LE devices. It’s also the first wireless keyboard with an RGB light ring. Numerous animations for the keys and light ring are built in.</p>
<p>Battery life varies based on brightness, light settings, and use. We estimate up to 16 hours with the stock rainbow wave pattern. If the light ring is enabled with per-key lighting, that estimate changes to 7 hours — a full day of work or gaming.</p>

<p>Three Choc switch options are available in the Venture. You must select a switch on Kono Store after the campaign closes (see Important Information above for details). Choosing a switch can be tough, so we're including some descriptions and raw data to help.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Choc Brown</strong>: gentle, smooth tactile switch (quiet, general purpose)</li>
<li> <strong>Choc Red</strong>: easy to press linear switch (quietest, great for gaming)</li>
<li> <strong>Choc White</strong>: sharp sounding clicky switch with amazing tactility (loudest, retooled)</li>

<p>If that jargon doesn't make sense, or you need more details, read the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Brown / tactile</strong> switches have a tangible “bump” when pressed, but no click. They’re a familiar option for typists and gamers — most keyboards are tactile.</li>
<li>
<strong>Red / linear</strong> switches don’t have a tactile bump or a click. That can be advantageous if you prefer uninhibited keypresses and extra smoothness during a press.</li>
<li>
<strong>White / clicky</strong> switches make sharp clicking noises. They also have a delightful tactile bump. Check with your coworkers, or family, before introducing a clicky keyboard. These were retooled for better performance in the X-1 campaign. They’re gloriously loud!</li>

Please send all questions to info@hexgears.org — this allows us to have conversations in a shared US support system. Inquiries on Indiegogo will be directed there as well. When the campaign closes, backers will be emailed a voucher code to redeem at Kono Store (our US partner). You must use your voucher on Kono to claim your reward.


Wireless keyboards let you choose your input experience. Want to game on the couch? Sure, and you can control compatible home theater devices while you’re there. Need to set up a presentation away from your desk? No problem — just unplug the keyboard and take it along. Wired devices (we launched a few this year) are useful for immobile work and stationary gaming, but you can’t beat wireless flexibility.


Keyboard switches directly affect your keyboarding performance and comfort. Mechanical switches, which have discrete metal contacts and springs, are better than mushy rubber domes in a few vital ways. Mechanical durability is remarkable; Venture’s Kailh Choc switches are rated for 70 million presses. While you can rest assured that your switches will stand the test of time, there’s something more important to consider.

Personalization is the key to your satisfaction as a typist or gamer, and mechanical keyboards deliver it. Three different switch options are available in the Venture — linear (red), tactile (brown), and tactile clicky (white, retooled). Each imparts a unique fingertip sensation, or form of tactile feedback, and doesn’t need to be bottomed out to activate. This results in slightly faster input, which is good for gaming. Regular rubber domes are squishy, unsatisfying, and almost always force you to press all the way down. View Venture’s features (below) to learn more and make a Choc switch selection.
 

Most wireless keyboards are compromised by poor design choices. Some optimize for battery life at the expense of key feel and features. Others alter keys to save space, creating an unfamiliar layout, or use a custom dongle that is incompatible with a range of devices. In rare cases, those trade-offs are worthwhile. Most of the time they’re not.
Nonstandard key sizes and other quirks can slow people down. Most companies fail to recognize that some of us want a familiar layout, which hurts the entire tech ecosystem. We created the 108-key Venture to avoid those pitfalls and innovate.


The Hexgears X-1 marked our debut in the US; it was also Hexgears’ first Kickstarter. Amazing backers and helpful reviewers pointed out potential changes. Some of the ideas weren’t right for the X-1, which we envisioned as an ultra-portable keyboard. The concept worked well as it was — an X-1 even went to the South Pole on a research expedition.

Most of those suggestions found a new home in the Venture. Mac keycaps were requested, and they'll be included with every Venture in the final production keyset.  Larger batteries, sculpted keycaps, and new RGB features (like a light ring) were added. Wireless subsystem updates and other tweaks are also complete. Even the manual will be improved vs. the X-1. Read about Venture’s compelling features below.

 

Venture can remember 4 paired devices and switch between them in a couple of seconds — phones, laptops, and more are fair game. This is convenient if you multitask with different devices, as you won’t need multiple keyboards. Venture’s carefully tuned Bluetooth Low Energy chip saves power, offers wide compatibility, and responds quickly while gaming. It operates at the fastest possible polling rate for high performance low latency input.

 

Dual 2000 mAh rechargeable cells are included with the keyboard (for a total of 4000 mAh). That’s a lot of power — more than most smartphones. With RGB lighting disabled, the keyboard lasts 4 weeks with 2-3 hours of use per day. That runtime can even be extended.
Venture’s batteries are user-replaceable via a compartment on the back of the keyboard. You can swap in standard AA cells or compatible rechargeable units. This increases endurance on the go and allows you to replace batteries if they degrade.

 

The Venture includes per-key RGB lighting, which is configured onboard. This ensures functionality with all keyboard-compatible Bluetooth LE devices. It’s also the first wireless keyboard with an RGB light ring. Numerous animations for the keys and light ring are built in.
Battery life varies based on brightness, light settings, and use. We estimate up to 16 hours with the stock rainbow wave pattern. If the light ring is enabled with per-key lighting, that estimate changes to 7 hours — a full day of work or gaming.
 

Three Choc switch options are available in the Venture. You must select a switch on Kono Store after the campaign closes (see Important Information above for details). Choosing a switch can be tough, so we're including some descriptions and raw data to help.

 Choc Brown: gentle, smooth tactile switch (quiet, general purpose)
 Choc Red: easy to press linear switch (quietest, great for gaming)
 Choc White: sharp sounding clicky switch with amazing tactility (loudest, retooled)





If that jargon doesn't make sense, or you need more details, read the following:


Brown / tactile switches have a tangible “bump” when pressed, but no click. They’re a familiar option for typists and gamers — most keyboards are tactile.

Red / linear switches don’t have a tactile bump or a click. That can be advantageous if you prefer uninhibited keypresses and extra smoothness during a press.

White / clicky switches make sharp clicking noises. They also have a delightful tactile bump. Check with your coworkers, or family, before introducing a clicky keyboard. These were retooled for better performance in the X-1 campaign. They’re gloriously loud!

 

The Venture's upper case is machine-finished aluminum, which is carefully textured and anodized for color. Its lower shell is durable injection molded plastic. This ensures solid Bluetooth signal penetration and reduces lower case wear.


We're including Mac keycaps for the bottom row — this is paired with a firmware Mac mode that swaps the modifier keys. Those were the most requested add-ons during the X-1 project.

<p>It'll be awesome if you spread word about the time revolution and share emit's campaign with your friends and family who need to change their perspective on time! </p>
</div></div>","Time is your most precious resource. Yet you irreversibly waste it away. It always feels like you're running behind on something.emit uses the psychology of time scarcity and auto-suggestion to help you become more productive and take control of your time. A simple and intuitive smartwatch that influences you to take action towards achieving your goals.


Timekeeping on phones and traditional smartwatches have to be done amidst all the noise and clutter of other apps which insidiously eat into your time. The best way to prioritize your goals over all other distractions is simple! Write down your targets, set a time frame to it and wear it on you to keep focused. 
Don't let time fly away before its too late. Own time. Own emit.

Viewing time as a countdown makes you perceive it as scarce, which influences your mind to be more proactive and value time more. You will become more realistic with your timelines, and stick to your schedule.  

START RIGHT 

See countdown to wake-up time rather than absolute time to feel energised for the day. Just seeing normal time doesn't have any context to you personally. Stay disciplined with your sleep with a constant reminder of time remaining before starting your day. 
LEAVE ON TIME

 
Know how far away your next event is so you’re always on schedule. Keep track of your day itinerary with a simple tap. 
ARRIVE ON TIME

Always on time. Everywhere. Having a countdown on your wrist helps to condition your mind so you become more punctual.

Seeing your most important tasks, events and goals on your wrist encourages you to be more conscientious in choosing the things that matter most to you. It reminds you of your priorities and compels you into action.  
PLAN

 
Note your goals physically to give you a vision. Set your mind on a target so that you can direct all your mind space towards it. 

EXECUTE


Implement your plans with hard work by staying focused. Having your goal on your body keeps you on the right track whilst others procrastinate away on their phones and other distractions. 

SUCCEED 


Achieve your targets within the set time-frame. Small moments of procrastination avoided quickly compound to greater results.  
You often start a project with a lot of passion, only to lose motivation along the way because the momentum fades or other aspects of life knock us down. emit has a progress face dedicated to intuitively show the time progress made within a long term mission so you stay dedicated. 
MOTIVATION

Schedule times for tasks so you adhere to them. Setting aside time to perform a task ensures that you are prepared for it and committed to it.  
CONSISTENCY   

Remind yourself of the bigger picture and your progress. The key to success is a lot of consistency and discipline which you can attain by reminding yourself of your end goal and your journey so far.

RESULTS


Effortlessly convert your plans to reality. Observing progress has shown to encourage us to be more adherent to our long-term goals. 

Keep yourself inspired by realistically planning look-forwards in life. emit can also remind you of the things in your life that make the struggle worthwhile.
 
ASPIRE

Dare to dream big. Dare to write down your dreams. Physically noting your goals makes it more realistic to you, pushing you to work harder towards them.  

LOOK-FORWARD  
Use your look-forwards to change your mind-set and recharge your mood. If you're having a bad day or week, remind yourself of the great things the future holds for you. 

REALIZE 


 
Make your dreams come true by wearing them on you. Aspire, achieve and go beyond. 

 
emit is a minimal smartwatch that focuses purely on timekeeping. Its core function is to change your mindset in regards to time. It syncs to your phone so you can easily select events on your calendar that you would like countdowns to. It also shows countdowns in different intuitive ways. 





Overview of features
 

 

emit syncs to both Android and iOS phones with free dedicated phone apps that enable you to easily add faces either manually or by selecting calendar events. emit sets up to 10 simultaneous countdowns such that you choose the things that really matter to you.
The app includes the following features: - Synchronise events from calendars to your emit - Add a range of calendars into the app - Manually add / edit faces to your emit - To-do list and choosing what items are displayed on the emit - Set vibrating alarms on your emit - See details about your emit including battery level and model number  
 
Supported Calendars
The app is compatible with calendar applications such as Google Calendar, iCal and Outlook so you have all your calendars in one place, and can choose your desired events to which you would like a countdown on your emit.

 

E.g. of emit's faces: 1 Day/Night countdown, 7 Event countdowns, 1 Progress & 1 Timer
 
 Here is a video of the emit setup experience using our current prototypes:

<br/>Timeline</h3>
<p>The Fidget Knob is based on a new patent pending technology created in 2016. The concept was to create a desk toy that would provide a fun and new experience to the user. After many design ideas, prototypes, and endless research of ergonomics and stress relieving material, we finalized the current prototype. We launched the Fidget Knob campaign this fall to bring the Fidget Knob to as many people as possible around the globe.</p>

<p>It’s the first time we’re conducting a crowd funding campaign but we have full confidence in making this project a success and satisfying our backers as not only does our team, but also our partner companies, have many years of experience and know-how in the development and manufacturing of innovative products. We’ve created many designs and prototypes of the Fidget Knob to get to this stage and are fully committed to this project. As we are always innovating, there is a possibility that the design and specifications will be modified to make it a better product. The production and shipment schedule could also be delayed based on the campaign results and situation. But even in that case we promise we will communicate with our backers faithfully so that the process is transparent and we will handle all issues that come our way in a truthful manner so that we meet the expectations of our supporters.<br/> </p>

Stretch Goal
We’d like to achieve the following goals to develop Fidget Knob and deliver a fun soothing experience to as many people as possible.




Timeline
The Fidget Knob is based on a new patent pending technology created in 2016. The concept was to create a desk toy that would provide a fun and new experience to the user. After many design ideas, prototypes, and endless research of ergonomics and stress relieving material, we finalized the current prototype. We launched the Fidget Knob campaign this fall to bring the Fidget Knob to as many people as possible around the globe.





The Team
This project is led by Masa Yamanaka, the president of Vanguard Industries, Inc., and his team. Masa has vast experience in developing solutions based on HCD (Human Centered Design) and is passionate about solving people’s everyday problems through technology. Product planning, design, and development will be conducted in Tokyo, while production will be implemented in Nagoya with a well respected partner manufacturing company. Vanguard thrives to bring innovative products to the world based on Japanese technology, design, and craftsmanship.

   
 

Risks & Challenges
It’s the first time we’re conducting a crowd funding campaign but we have full confidence in making this project a success and satisfying our backers as not only does our team, but also our partner companies, have many years of experience and know-how in the development and manufacturing of innovative products. We’ve created many designs and prototypes of the Fidget Knob to get to this stage and are fully committed to this project. As we are always innovating, there is a possibility that the design and specifications will be modified to make it a better product. The production and shipment schedule could also be delayed based on the campaign results and situation. But even in that case we promise we will communicate with our backers faithfully so that the process is transparent and we will handle all issues that come our way in a truthful manner so that we meet the expectations of our supporters.

<p><b>                                      Community helping Community.</b></p>
<p>Because our focus is in bringing communities together, Small Business US has committed 3% of our fundraising efforts here today to our community partners as well. <b>Of every $100 we raise today, we are giving $3 to our community partners to help. </b></p>
<p>Here they are: </p>
<p><b>Proud Nation -</b>   Helping and finding creative and physical ways to                                                     help <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">underprivileged children learn and soar!</span></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Our price is important to us. </b>If we outprice small businesses, we can't help them. If we leverage investors, we must raise our price. This is why this funding project is so important to small business success. Our first 3 months in a state will be at $197/mo, after it will be $248. Whatever they join at will be their price for life. It's that important.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>How do we stay profitable?</b> Because we leverage the community, we can offer these services at the cost of hiring a consultant for just one hour. Consultants know that when a small business succeeds, they become able to afford consultants, so they enjoy supporting our group. </span></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Although we launched first in CT, the amount of crowd-funding will dictate our rate of growth. </h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b><i>For every $200,000 raised, we can fund one more state.</i></b></span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The initial funding will cover our initial investment costs and position us to launch our next community. We are currently poised to launch in NY and MA at the close of this campaign. Our total goal is $2M. $2M gets us to 39 states in 5 years. That's a pretty big spark!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Our Board of Directors</b> are mostly seasoned, successful small business owners who have grown their businesses successfully for a number of years. We also boast corporate experience to help deliver big resources to small businesses.</p>
<p><b>Growth Strategy: </b>: Recent statistic shows that 5% of America owns their own business but 60% of America is thinking about starting one. We expect to launch 2 more states in 2014. In 2014, we will also invest in the infrastructure necessary to launch 10 new locations in 2015. Because it's necessary to establish a geographic location (office) in other states, it makes it impossible to fund a new state without raising prices. This is a commitment we're not going to negotiate. Small Business is an important emerging market and our strategy is strong and tested.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have the ability to improve success rates in small business, screen quality next level support, and help improve people's lives. Small Businesses are fueling the American economy: 99.7 of all employer firms are considered Small Businesses vs. Corporations and this number continues to grow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Small Businesses account for 55.4% of all U.S. Sales and 55% of all American jobs</li>
<li>The number of small businesses has increased by 49% since 1982. As Big businesses downsize, the number of start-ups has grown.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, there are resources available through SBA to help small businesses, but if you've ever owned your own business, you know time is valuable. More importantly, you have to know what questions to ask to be able to receive help. Small Business America not only lends help defining the problem, but the Board program helps hold business owners accountable to their own success.</p>
<p>A Small Business Connecticut/America charter membership costs $197/mo ( a price locked in for life) and will raise to $248/mo after our initial 3 month introduction into a new location.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>About Us:</h3>
<p>You can certainly learn about me and the Board of Directors on our site. I'd like to share something more important to me: <i>My motivation.</i></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I grew up in a single parent home. My mother owned a real estate agency. It was very successful in the height of its life. When my mother fell ill, there were no provisions, leadership or structure in place. I watched her business crumble and our lives change. I swore because of this, I would never own my own business. What I didn't realize at the time, but can see clearly now, is the lack of well-rounded information that could have resulted in a far different outcome.</span></p>
<p>Fast forward 23 years. I've paid my dues in Corporate America. I grew tired of making more money for the corporation while they continued to ask more from my team (of over 3,000 employees) Meanwhile, they had the most profitable year ever and I handed out raises that were embarrassing to give to great employees because they were so low. </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">So, I want Small Business US to be a spark in the Universe.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>       I want to create an affordable program that can help America,                                                                       not take from it.</b> </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I want to surround myself with people who feel the same. I want to leverage the tools I've been given in my corporate career and share them with a greater population.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> I ask my Board of Directors to always keep us working from a place of honesty, goodness, philanthropy and good will - never from a place of greed. I'm realistic in knowing that a company has to have assets and profit to protect its team through economic tides, but I also believe a company will grow faster and those rewards will still be met when you keep your community and your team first. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I am asking you to help fund our project so that we may start strong and help small businesses succeed.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">                 <b>    Every donation is greatly appreciated. Thank you!</b></span></p>

That's why we need your help.              When a small business owner fails, more than a job is lost. Why do they fail?We counted 48 reasons. Our program not only solves every one of them, but does so while giving the business owner a sense of community and support.              85% of these FUNDED  entrepreneurs on Indiegogo will fail.    Remember the last business you recall closing in your home town?    You may not have been an expert, but I bet you could have given them some valuable advice to help them be more successful? Did you?            We do. 4 Key Elements:1. Peer Advisory BoardsPeer Advisory Boards have a 25% sales impact on small businesses. Our members now have their own Board of Directors made up of non-competing peers. Their board will promote and protect them.2. Marketing Program     We all know the effect of a solid marketing strategy, but most entrepreneurs can't afford $50,000 to have access  to one. We make our PROVEN program accessible to every member and give them the support they need to navigate through it while holding them accountable.          Our program is the most comprehensive program available.                         It's results are consistent, proven and relevant for every business!3. Access to Experienced, Talented Consultants 8 times a month                            YES, UNQUALIFIED CONSULTANTS HATE US! We happen to have noticed a problem with small business owners being sweet talked by hordes of silver-tongued consultants and advisers...an unqualified consultant can destroy a small business! We vet all of our advisers and make them accessible to answer questions 8 times a month for our members.4. HR Outsourcing                              Lastly, you didn't start a business to have to deal with people problems. We help every member through people problems, state and local laws, and leadership challenges. We have seen UNBELIEVABLE results spanning from sales increases to giving our owners back A LOT OF TIME in their day.We're an active part of the community. Today, you will be too!

                                      Community helping Community.
Because our focus is in bringing communities together, Small Business US has committed 3% of our fundraising efforts here today to our community partners as well. Of every $100 we raise today, we are giving $3 to our community partners to help. 
Here they are: 
Proud Nation -   Helping and finding creative and physical ways to                                                     help underprivileged children learn and soar!
CT Youth Forum - Helping high school students eliminate preconceptions and grow as leaders together despite social and economic differences.
Sadie-Mae Foundation - Helping bring animals home to families





Our price is important to us. If we outprice small businesses, we can't help them. If we leverage investors, we must raise our price. This is why this funding project is so important to small business success. Our first 3 months in a state will be at $197/mo, after it will be $248. Whatever they join at will be their price for life. It's that important.
How do we stay profitable? Because we leverage the community, we can offer these services at the cost of hiring a consultant for just one hour. Consultants know that when a small business succeeds, they become able to afford consultants, so they enjoy supporting our group. 

Although we launched first in CT, the amount of crowd-funding will dictate our rate of growth. 



For every $200,000 raised, we can fund one more state.

The initial funding will cover our initial investment costs and position us to launch our next community. We are currently poised to launch in NY and MA at the close of this campaign. Our total goal is $2M. $2M gets us to 39 states in 5 years. That's a pretty big spark!

Our Board of Directors are mostly seasoned, successful small business owners who have grown their businesses successfully for a number of years. We also boast corporate experience to help deliver big resources to small businesses.
Growth Strategy: : Recent statistic shows that 5% of America owns their own business but 60% of America is thinking about starting one. We expect to launch 2 more states in 2014. In 2014, we will also invest in the infrastructure necessary to launch 10 new locations in 2015. Because it's necessary to establish a geographic location (office) in other states, it makes it impossible to fund a new state without raising prices. This is a commitment we're not going to negotiate. Small Business is an important emerging market and our strategy is strong and tested.
Testimonials: You can see our recent testimonials on our member blog site. We hope to continue to add more every day! Testimonials (If you go there, PLEASE come back and donate!)



The Impact
We have the ability to improve success rates in small business, screen quality next level support, and help improve people's lives. Small Businesses are fueling the American economy: 99.7 of all employer firms are considered Small Businesses vs. Corporations and this number continues to grow.

Small Businesses account for 55.4% of all U.S. Sales and 55% of all American jobs
The number of small businesses has increased by 49% since 1982. As Big businesses downsize, the number of start-ups has grown.

Yes, there are resources available through SBA to help small businesses, but if you've ever owned your own business, you know time is valuable. More importantly, you have to know what questions to ask to be able to receive help. Small Business America not only lends help defining the problem, but the Board program helps hold business owners accountable to their own success.
A Small Business Connecticut/America charter membership costs $197/mo ( a price locked in for life) and will raise to $248/mo after our initial 3 month introduction into a new location.


About Us:
You can certainly learn about me and the Board of Directors on our site. I'd like to share something more important to me: My motivation.
I grew up in a single parent home. My mother owned a real estate agency. It was very successful in the height of its life. When my mother fell ill, there were no provisions, leadership or structure in place. I watched her business crumble and our lives change. I swore because of this, I would never own my own business. What I didn't realize at the time, but can see clearly now, is the lack of well-rounded information that could have resulted in a far different outcome.
Fast forward 23 years. I've paid my dues in Corporate America. I grew tired of making more money for the corporation while they continued to ask more from my team (of over 3,000 employees) Meanwhile, they had the most profitable year ever and I handed out raises that were embarrassing to give to great employees because they were so low. 
So, I want Small Business US to be a spark in the Universe.
       I want to create an affordable program that can help America,                                                                       not take from it. 
I want to surround myself with people who feel the same. I want to leverage the tools I've been given in my corporate career and share them with a greater population.
 I ask my Board of Directors to always keep us working from a place of honesty, goodness, philanthropy and good will - never from a place of greed. I'm realistic in knowing that a company has to have assets and profit to protect its team through economic tides, but I also believe a company will grow faster and those rewards will still be met when you keep your community and your team first. 
I am asking you to help fund our project so that we may start strong and help small businesses succeed.
                     Every donation is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

<h2><strong>How Does Alison Work?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">It’s simple. All you need to do is connect your email inbox to the app so she can start to process your email flow. She’ll learn how you use email and start helping you right away. If you only want her help for specific tasks, just let her know. She can dynamically change how she interacts with you based on your preferences.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Each time Alison processes one of your emails she uses one email credit. Alison will continue processing emails until all of your available credits are exhausted.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">For example, the intro package comes with 30 email credits to be used over one month. Alison will process and perform notifications and tasks for the last 30 emails in your inbox. Once 30 emails are processed for the month, you will have to wait until the next month for the email credits to reload. Higher tier subscriptions will allow for more email processing per month.</p>

<h3>What FindMeEvidence is all about</h3>
<p>Did you know that <strong>medical doctors fail to find answers to 41% of the questions they pursue in daily medical routine</strong>? Studies show that web search engines could help answer some of these questions, but their results are of sometimes dubious quality and finding the right answer takes too long. Specialized medical search engines are often locked away behind a paywall and cannot be accessed by many medical professionals. <strong>This situation leaves many medical questions unanswered, potentially leading to less-then-ideal care decisions.</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to improve the quality of global health care a bit by creating<strong><em> FindMeEvidence</em>, a freely available, open-source search engine that helps medical doctors (and patients) find relevant information right when they need it</strong>. </p>
<p><em>FindMeEvidence</em> can revolutionize medical information search because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is optimized for the needs of medical professionals</li>
<li>It is ideal for doing quick searches in busy situations (such as during patient care). Text snippets containing answers are shown right in the result list, so you usually don't have to visit remote websites to read through the full text.</li>
<li>It has a good signal/noise ratio: only content relevant for making medical decisions is fed into the search engine.</li>
<li>It works well on mobile devices so you can access information everywhere (e.g., if you are a doctor, you can use it while visiting patients)</li>
<li>It has built-in translation features. Many good sources of evidence are available in English only, and non-native speakers benefit from  assistance in formulating queries and understanding results.</li>
<li>It is light-weight, freely available and open-source. If needed, you can easily install a local version adapted to your needs or the needs of your organisation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>The development of <em>FindMeEvidence</em> is coordinated by <strong><a href=""http://samwald.info/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dr. Matthias Samwald</a></strong>, a researcher in biomedical informatics and multidisciplinary geek at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. Matthias originally started out as a neuroscientist but decided to leave the lab in favour of computer-based work, because he figured that this is where most paradigm-shifting changes in medicine will happen in the 21st century. He previously worked with a wide variety of research institutions and companies, such as Yale University and Creative Commons. He is a member of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>
<p>Matthias is supported by <strong>Dr. Claus-Dieter Volko, </strong>who is a medical doctor and a computer scientist in one person. He is passionate about applying his rare mixture of skills in a project that can have a real impact on patient care.</p>

<h3>What we need &amp; What you get</h3>
<p>We have already created an early prototype of the software. However, there are still lots of things that require a full-time development effort for a few months in order to realize the full potential of the system.</p>
<p><strong>We need at least 7500€ to create a '1.0' release that can be used in clinical settings.</strong> One of the most important goals here -- as with any search engine -- is to further optimize ranking of results, so that most relevant results always come first.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>not-for-profit</strong> project. The <strong>FindMeEvidence search engine and all other project results will be made openly available - hopefully benefiting you, your family and everyone else</strong>. We want this project to have an impact on health care on a global scale.</p>

<h3>Everest Planner is an all-in-one daily planner (the 2nd half year of 2018 from July to December) based on the UNIQUE system that will help you set goals, be more organized and increase your productivity! It´s a complex tool with all the function you need so by getting it, you won´t have to carry around any other notebooks, journals etc. ALSO for every planner you buy, we'll plant one tree.</h3>

</h3>
<p><strong>Our story began about two years ago. We both started feeling lost in our day-to-day life. We had so much on our to-do list but we felt like we are moving nowhere towards our goals and dreams. We believed that we aspired for more in our lives. The change was necessary as we wanted to get back on right track. So we started studying the lifehacks described by the top-performing, the most achieving people in the world.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512386035/eecdodhigbc7wcysllth.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We read tons of books trying to figure out what we were missing in our lives. After thorough research, <strong>we combined the proven methods to set goals, be effective and increase productivity with the basic function every planner should have, like scheduling the meetings, taking (a lot of) notes etc. so you won´t have to carry around any other journal or notebook.</strong> We built several prototypes and gave it for testing to our friends and family. We've implemented the feedback and finally created the nowadays' version of Everest Planner! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512386111/yfxzuq9jlwyhjkxylahh.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>On our way to a better self, we managed to identify several key elements that lead a person to live successful and happier life. We came to a conclusion that <strong>the difference between those who accomplish their dreams and those who don't is a conscious decision to write down your goals, set a long-term vision and proactively take action.</strong> We implemented all those findings into the Everest Planner. </p>

<p><strong>As the old saying goes, content is the king. But we have made sure that the user's experience will be extraordinary by involving several extra features. Let's check them out!</strong></p>

<h3><strong>And now let's take a look inside...</strong></h3>
<p>There are four key parts - setting the vision and the goals at the start of the planner, daily layout, weekly reflection and monthly overview. All of them combine the tools you need in order to achieve great things. <strong>Click on <a href=""https://issuu.com/matushorniacek/docs/everest_january_full_version_2018"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">THIS LINK</a> to have a look at planner from inside.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We created a unique system that will guide you on your way of developing the long-term vision and the goals for next 6 months. It consists of 5 steps: </strong></p>

</div></div>","Everest Planner is an all-in-one daily planner (the 2nd half year of 2018 from July to December) based on the UNIQUE system that will help you set goals, be more organized and increase your productivity! It´s a complex tool with all the function you need so by getting it, you won´t have to carry around any other notebooks, journals etc. ALSO for every planner you buy, we'll plant one tree.



Our story began about two years ago. We both started feeling lost in our day-to-day life. We had so much on our to-do list but we felt like we are moving nowhere towards our goals and dreams. We believed that we aspired for more in our lives. The change was necessary as we wanted to get back on right track. So we started studying the lifehacks described by the top-performing, the most achieving people in the world.

We read tons of books trying to figure out what we were missing in our lives. After thorough research, we combined the proven methods to set goals, be effective and increase productivity with the basic function every planner should have, like scheduling the meetings, taking (a lot of) notes etc. so you won´t have to carry around any other journal or notebook. We built several prototypes and gave it for testing to our friends and family. We've implemented the feedback and finally created the nowadays' version of Everest Planner! 

On our way to a better self, we managed to identify several key elements that lead a person to live successful and happier life. We came to a conclusion that the difference between those who accomplish their dreams and those who don't is a conscious decision to write down your goals, set a long-term vision and proactively take action. We implemented all those findings into the Everest Planner. 


As the old saying goes, content is the king. But we have made sure that the user's experience will be extraordinary by involving several extra features. Let's check them out!

And now let's take a look inside...
There are four key parts - setting the vision and the goals at the start of the planner, daily layout, weekly reflection and monthly overview. All of them combine the tools you need in order to achieve great things. Click on THIS LINK to have a look at planner from inside.


We created a unique system that will guide you on your way of developing the long-term vision and the goals for next 6 months. It consists of 5 steps: 
1. Creating a 5 years' vision defined in 5 key areas of your life: Personal growth, Career, Relationships, Daily routine, and Health. We will guide you through this process by using a set of well-chosen questions.
2. The secret step - We won't spoil you a surprise of finding it out on your own. This step works the best if you are not prepared for it beforehand, so you can look forward to it after securing your own Everest Planner.
3. Goals for nexť 6 months - Based on your vision, you will set goals for next 6 months in each of the 5 key areas of your life. Plus you´ll get one bonus goal! 
4. Focus is the key - This tool will help you choose one goal for the next six months that has a potential to help you the most to get closer to your long-term vision 
5. Actionable steps - Now you need to break your main focus for next six months (from the point 4) into actionable steps on the monthly and weekly basis. This way you'll make sure that you will stay on the right track during the next six months. 

Thanks to our daily layout, you can plan your meetings, build new habits, remind yourself to relax or exercise and express a gratitude. Setting two most important tasks every day (and finishing them as first) will help you become more focused and more productive.

Unlike many other journals or planners, Everest Planner offers you a lot of space for notes on an everyday basis.​

The weekly layout enables you to reflect on the past week. At the end of every week, you get to answer a different (let's say bonus) question that will also help you move forward. Preparing the to-do list on the next page is based on setting the priorities, again. Our reward system will make completing the tasks more fun.


You need to have a clear vision of what you are going to face the following month. This overview will serve you as a great tool. 

By the way, that's the reason why we have two ribbon markers. You can have the first one on the current day and the second one on the current month.

Our goal is to help as many people as possible and also to help our planet. That's why we decided that besides bringing you the planner that will set you on a journey to become the best version of yourself, we are also going to plant a tree for every planner you buy.

Migeran Ltd was founded by Dr. Annamaria Mattasits and Gergely Kis, both mobile industry veterans. 
</p>
<p>
In the last 10 years we worked as developers, architects and project managers on all major mobile platforms. In the past 6 years we
were managing our software consulting business, where we created mobile apps for various platforms including iOS, Android and
BlackBerry. We enhanced the Android platform on multiple different hardware devices, and also successfully built complex enterprise solutions based on Java EE, web &amp; mobile technologies.  
</p>
<p>
We started Migeran Ltd to build the best tools for software developers. The Migeran Development Tools finally allows developers to write iOS Apps in Java without any compromise in productivity or ease of development.

Annamaria is the cool head behind Migeran’s success. Her down to earth, practical attitude gives us the edge to meet hard deadlines and 
face big challenges.

Gergely is in charge of building the best products for developers. His strong vision led to Migeran: a Complete Development Environment to finally make iOS App development in Java fun and productive.

<p>With Migeran, Java and Android developers can unlock the wonders of the iOS World, while still using the tools they know best:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real, native iOS Apps can be written in Java</li>
<li>The runtime is based on Dalvik from Android</li>
<li>Eclipse support for editing, on device debugging and testing Migeran apps and libraries</li>
<li>Straightforward integration with native iOS tools for UI design and reusing Objective-C components</li>
</ul><p>iOS Developers can join the party as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep using the standard iOS development tools, like Xcode</li>
<li>Use Migeran's Automated Binding Generator to export your Objective-C components to the rest of the team.</li>
<li>Concentrate on the most exciting challenges in the project: design stunning UI components and make clever optimizations.</li>
<li>Enjoy the increased productivity of the team while cooperating with fellow Java developers</li>

<h3>Roadmap to Migeran 1.0</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.migeran.com/img/indiegogo/roadmap1.png"" src="""" style=""""/>

Right after the Indiegogo Campaign ends, we will release the first beta version to the campaign contributors with Early Access membership. This Beta 1 will include:
<ul>
<li>Updated runtime to <strong>Android KitKat</strong>
</li>
<li>Support for <strong>iOS 7.1</strong>
</li>
</ul>

In March 2014 we will release the second beta to the Early Access members with updates and improvements. After some polishing the final Migeran 1.0 will be released in April 2014. This release will be available to the general public as well. 

<h3>Maintenance Releases</h3>

Maintenance releases are scheduled to follow new iOS releases. In case of critical bugs special maintenance releases will be made.

<h3>Customer Driven Roadmap</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.migeran.com/img/indiegogo/roadmap2.png"" src="""" style=""""/>

Future feature releases will be based on customer priorities. We do have a few features planned, but ultimately our customers (and campaign conributors) decide the order in which these features will be implemented:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>IntelliJ Support</strong>: We love Eclipse, but IntelliJ is also a great IDE, that is very popular among developers. Now, that Android Studio is based on IntelliJ, more and more Android developers will get to know it as well. We plan to port our IDE features to IntelliJ to make it a first class Migeran IDE.</li>
<li>
<strong>Gradle Support</strong>: Currently the Migeran Build System is based on Ant. We plan to add Gradle support to make the integration with Android projects even easier.</li>
<li>

Migeran in 60 Seconds(top)



Migeran is a runtime and development environment that allows you to write iOS applications in Java.

Migeran is designed for:


Java Developers, who want to develop iOS Apps


Android Developers, who want to port their Android Apps to iOS


Project Managers, who want to improve their Team's productivity when creating Apps for both iOS and Android

Migeran is better than other frameworks:


Includes Unique Tools, like: On Device Debugging, Automated Binding Generator and first class IDE Integration


Reduce cost and complexity through code sharing: Migeran allows you to write the business logic in common Java code to share between Android and iOS. Platform specific parts of the iOS version can be developed in Java, Objective-C, C/C++ or even assembly.


Contests

Goal-Code Contest (top)

The Migeran Campaign's goal is set to $51.966. There are 2 reasons for this. The first 3 people who send in the correct answers to contest@migeran.com and also share the Migeran Campaign on Twitter, Facebook and G+, will get a Migeran T-Shirt.

To be eiligible for the T-Shirt, you should include the correct answer and proof that you shared the Migeran Campaign on Twitter, Facebook and G+ as well. You don't have to be a contributor to win, but we recommend you to use Indiegogo's sharing tools, so you also enter the Sharing Contest at the same time. 


Sharing Contest: Spread the Word and Earn Rewards(top)



With Indiegogo's tools we can easily track where visitors to our campaign came from. This allows us to announce the Migeran Sharing Contest.
In order for Indiegogo's tracking technology to work, you have to use the Share buttons up at the top of our campaign (right under the video) and you have to be logged in.
Important Tip! You don't have to be a contributor to earn rewards!  Just be sure to be logged in when you share our campaign, using the share buttons, of course.


About Us(top)


Migeran Ltd was founded by Dr. Annamaria Mattasits and Gergely Kis, both mobile industry veterans. 


In the last 10 years we worked as developers, architects and project managers on all major mobile platforms. In the past 6 years we
were managing our software consulting business, where we created mobile apps for various platforms including iOS, Android and
BlackBerry. We enhanced the Android platform on multiple different hardware devices, and also successfully built complex enterprise solutions based on Java EE, web & mobile technologies.  


We started Migeran Ltd to build the best tools for software developers. The Migeran Development Tools finally allows developers to write iOS Apps in Java without any compromise in productivity or ease of development.



Annamaria is the cool head behind Migeran’s success. Her down to earth, practical attitude gives us the edge to meet hard deadlines and 
face big challenges.




Gergely is in charge of building the best products for developers. His strong vision led to Migeran: a Complete Development Environment to finally make iOS App development in Java fun and productive.


We have a team of great developers, who are working tirelessly to make Migeran even better.


For Developers(top)


With Migeran, Java and Android developers can unlock the wonders of the iOS World, while still using the tools they know best:

Real, native iOS Apps can be written in Java
The runtime is based on Dalvik from Android
Eclipse support for editing, on device debugging and testing Migeran apps and libraries
Straightforward integration with native iOS tools for UI design and reusing Objective-C components
iOS Developers can join the party as well:

Keep using the standard iOS development tools, like Xcode
Use Migeran's Automated Binding Generator to export your Objective-C components to the rest of the team.
Concentrate on the most exciting challenges in the project: design stunning UI components and make clever optimizations.
Enjoy the increased productivity of the team while cooperating with fellow Java developers


For Project Managers(top)


With the standard development tools, targeting both Android and iOS means
                                        the development of the same app twice, with 2 different teams.
This leads to increased management overhead, that could be avoided with the right tools.
With Migeran, you work with a single team:


Shorten Time to Market: Build the application for Android and iOS at the same time.

Cut costs through code reuse: The common logic is shared between platforms.
With Migeran your existing Java and Android developers can become iOS developers as well.

Migeran provides all the tools for efficient Java development on iOS.


Available in the App Store(top)


The first Migeran App is already in the App Store and more are on the way!


The Road Ahead(top)

Roadmap to Migeran 1.0


Right after the Indiegogo Campaign ends, we will release the first beta version to the campaign contributors with Early Access membership. This Beta 1 will include:

Updated runtime to Android KitKat

Support for iOS 7.1



In March 2014 we will release the second beta to the Early Access members with updates and improvements. After some polishing the final Migeran 1.0 will be released in April 2014. This release will be available to the general public as well. 

Maintenance Releases

Maintenance releases are scheduled to follow new iOS releases. In case of critical bugs special maintenance releases will be made.

Customer Driven Roadmap


Future feature releases will be based on customer priorities. We do have a few features planned, but ultimately our customers (and campaign conributors) decide the order in which these features will be implemented:


IntelliJ Support: We love Eclipse, but IntelliJ is also a great IDE, that is very popular among developers. Now, that Android Studio is based on IntelliJ, more and more Android developers will get to know it as well. We plan to port our IDE features to IntelliJ to make it a first class Migeran IDE.

Gradle Support: Currently the Migeran Build System is based on Ant. We plan to add Gradle support to make the integration with Android projects even easier.

Migeran for Mac: Migeran's technology is not limited to iOS, it can be used on the desktop as well.

Your Feature: We are committed to make Migeran the ideal development environment. This means that we will implement the features based on our customers' requests and priorities.


Migeran in Action: Your First App in 3 Minutes(top)

Check out Migeran in action on the video below:



Robust Flexibility(top)


If you look at a Migeran App's architecture, the most important thing to notice is flexibility.
With Migeran, the developers are not locked into a single tool. Rather, Migeran provides a platform to combine multiple development environments:


You can use Migeran's Runtime based on Dalvik from Android, with full access to the standard iOS API
You can also use any 3rd party native libraries

At the same time, the vast number of Java libraries are also accessible

Finally, you can not only write your application code in Java, but you also have the option to implement parts of the app in native code – in Objective-C, C++ or even assembly

Migeran provides an integrated workflow to make these options feel natural, not an afterthought.


Bug Hunting: On Device Debugging(top)

Watch our screencast about on device debugging below:



Nat/J: Our Bridge is Yours(top)


Nat/J is the Java to native bridge of Migeran. Unlike JNI, it is very easy to use – you can configure the native bindings declaratively using annotations – without even writing a single line of native code.

Nat/J also has full support for the Objective-C features, so the whole iOS API can be represented in Java.
And finally, with Nat/J you don't even have to write the annotated Java code by hand – just use the integrated Nat/J Generator from Eclipse to create the binding classes automatically.


The Nat/J Generator of course works with any Objective-C library, not just the standard iOS APIs, so if you already invested in native iOS components, you can quickly make them available in your Migeran projects as well.



Eclipse & Xcode: The Best of Both Worlds(top)

Eclipse is one of the best Java IDEs. Xcode is the tool for Objective-C development.
Migeran brings these two worlds together in a seamless, productive workflow:
                                            
Create your Migeran project in Eclipse, and an associated Xcode project is created automatically.
The Xcode project is automatically updated, if source files are changed in Eclipse.
Java developers can continue to work in their familiar environment, and only start Xcode to design
                                                user interfaces.
Objective-C and iOS experts can dive into Xcode: implement native components
                                                and make them available for the Java developers.


UI Design: The Beauty on the Surface(top)

Xcode includes Interface Builder, a full featured user interface designer 
                                        solution. It is unfortunately strongly tied to the Objective-C language.
Migeran lets Java developers to leverage the power of Interface Builder
                                        without learning Objective-C itself:
                                            
Migeran generates the necessary Objective-C stub classes automatically to work with Interface Builder.
You can just create a new screen right from Eclipse, edit the UI in Xcode, then write the action logic in Java in a matter of a few seconds.
Outlets and actions connected to the stub classes are reflected in the Java source.
Naturally, manual modifications in the Java classes are preserved.
We implemented a solution, which works not only with the straightforward case of a single UIViewController for a XIB file, but also with complex cases including multiple linked classes and Storyboards.
You can even go wild and implement hybrid classes: one part in Objective-C and the other part in Java.


Testing & Deployment: Tame the Inner Beast(top)

A straightforward test & deployment setup is essential for efficient development. 
                                        With Migeran, everything is set up for you:
                                            
Every Migeran project is pre-configured with separate unit testing and acceptance testing configurations.
JUnit tests can be executed from Eclipse
The acceptance testing configuration uses Frank to enable a Behavior Driven Development workflow.
The build system includes a distribution build task to enable easy deployments to the App Store and to beta testers.


The Droid Inside(top)

In order to make porting Android apps to iOS even easier, Migeran includes an Android Compatibility Library, which implements the core Android APIs for iOS.
There are a lot of APIs that will be supported, like:


the Android Logger – which is used by every Android app

The Android 2D graphics and OpenGL API

Or a lightweight implementation of core APIs like Binder, Intents, or Resources – just to support more of the higher level APIs.

This library is a work in progress, and we count on the developer community to work with us so we can set the right priorities for our development efforts.



The Migeran Difference(top)

Migeran is not your average Indiegogo Project.
It is not just an idea, we already have a working version, that is currently evaluated by selected beta testers.
We started this campaign to present Migeran to a wider audience, and to get the valuable input of early adopters, so we can build the best possible product for our customers.
Contributors to this campaign will get huge discounts on Migeran subscription prices, and also the opportunity to get their hands on the next Migeran beta release, right after the end of this campaign.


Perks with Subscriptions(top)

Migeran is licensed with a simple, developer seat based subscription model. The term of each subscription is 1 year. We have a single version, which includes all software features. Larger subscriptions include more additional services.
Every subscriber also gets feature votes, which can be used to influence the direction of Migeran development. We will allocate more resources to such up-voted features than others.

With each subscription, a perpetual, royalty free license is granted for those Migeran versions that were released while the subscription was active. These versions may be used after the subscription ends, but no other services (e.g. updates, customer support, project assistance) are provided.

Pro Subscription

The Pro subscription includes email support with a next business day reaction time SLA. It also includes 5 feature votes intead of the 2 included in the Starter subscription. 

Pro subscribers also get access to pre-release versions of Migeran. 

The Migeran Academy (with high quality training material) and Project Assistance service is available to Pro subscribers at extra cost.

Enterprise Subscription

The Enterprise subscription includes premium support with a next business day reaction time SLA. It also includes 10 feature votes instead of the 5 included in the Pro subscription.

Enterprise subscribers also get access to pre-release versions of Migeran. Access to the Migeran Academy is also included.

Project Assistance service is available to Enterprise subscribers at extra cost.



Perks for Teams(top)



If you are considering Migeran for your Team, we have prepared 3 options for you.

Perks to Support Migeran(top)

T-Shirt: for $49, you will get a Migeran T-Shirt and 15% discount from the Starter subscription when Migeran 1.0 is released.


Migeran Support Levels(top)


Migeran offers 3 support levels:



Community Support will be an internet forum dedicated to Migeran. Migeran Ltd support engineers will monitor and answer questions posted on the forum, but there is no SLA provided for the response times.

Email Support is included in Pro subscriptions. According to the SLA, Migeran Ltd support engineers will respond to each request by the end of the next business day.

Premium Support is included in Enterprise subscriptions. The key difference is, that Premium Support is not limited to email or the phone. Our support engineers will work with you to resolve the problems by any means necessary, including: screen sharing sessions to reproduce the issues on your system or even conference calls with the actual Migeran developers.
	According to the SLA, Migeran Ltd support engineers will respond to each request by the end of the next business day.


Project Assistance(top)


When starting to work with a new framework or a new platform, there are always corner cases and though business problems that can take a lot of time to resolve, even with superb documentation and training material. 


This is where Project Assistance can help you: when it is not clear which design pattern or implementation technique should be used to find an optimal solution.

Our experienced engineers will work with you remotely using screen sharing, help with the design, implementation and testing of your application. We also offer Project Assistance sessions designed for specific project phases, for example: Kick-Off, Requirement Analysis, Design, Rapid Prototyping, Implementation, Deployment and Project Review.


Project Assistance is charged on an hourly basis. For more information, please contact us at: support@migeran.com.


VAT: Perks in the EU(top)


Migeran Ltd is based in the United Kingdom, therefore we have to charge 20% VAT each customer from the UK.


If you are from another EU member state and you have an EU VAT number, then we do not charge VAT, but we will need your EU VAT number. We will ask for it in a separate email, after you sent the order through Indiegogo.


If you are from another EU member state and you do not have an EU VAT number, then we also have to charge 20% VAT.


If you are not from the EU, then no VAT will be charged.


If we need to charge VAT, you have 2 options:


We entered the required amount into the description of each perk. You can add this amount to your contribution, and you are done.
If you forgot to add the VAT to your order, don't worry. When Migeran 1.0 is released, you will be directed to our web store to complete the order and pay the remaining VAT.

If you have any questions regarding VAT or anything else, do not hesitate to contact us at: support@migeran.com.",21.0,2,"1 Campaign

It is easy to get your team excited about the upcoming Retrospective - just give them a chance to choose the topics they would like to discuss.
 

You can also adjust the deck before giving it to the team. Only pick the techniques you would like them to focus on, or only those you are ready to run.
 

Make it more entertaining by playing a ""roulette"" version of the Retrospective Poker - put your deck face down and ask someone to pick a card randomly.
One of my teams would nominate a new person each sprint to randomly pick a card from the deck.
 Use the deck and the brochure as your cheatsheet for all techniques

When you are not sure what Retrospective to run, glance through the Retrospective Poker deck to get a reminder of what's available to you.
 

The deck comes with short instructions brochure that will guide you through preparing and running all techniques in the deck. You can always bring it with you as a cheatsheet for your session as it fits nicely into the case.

 

You can choose the technique based on the time you have available. You can also make a decision based on how comfortable you are running this Retrospective type given your Scrum Master experience and team maturity.
Bring the cards with you to the Retrospective to always know what to focus your discussion on.
