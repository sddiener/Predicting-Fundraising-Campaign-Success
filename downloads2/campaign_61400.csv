<p class=""p1"">I have a huge favor to ask of you.</p>
<p class=""p1"">My name is Bethany Francis, or BFranSass… whichever you'd prefer</p>

<p class=""p1"">I have my yoga certification through the international yoga alliance,</p>
<p class=""p2"">and nothing brings me greater joy than sharing the gift of yoga with others.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So, after creepin on youtube for a….fair..amount of time,</p>
<p class=""p1"">I realized there wasn't really a weekly yoga vlog</p>
<p class=""p1"">you know with sequences and teaching about philosophy of yoga itself,</p>
<p class=""p1"">and then i was like,</p>
<p class=""p1"">I COULD DO THAT! </p>
<p class=""p1"">And that made me both excited and terrified.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So what I'm doing is making a youtube channel where I'll post 2 videos a week -</p>
<p class=""p1"">One, with a yoga sequence,</p>
<p class=""p1"">So if you can't afford dropping into a class at your local yoga studio-</p>
<p class=""p1"">which I highly recommend, 'cause there's nothing like a yoga class</p>
<p class=""p1"">where you're there..with people... adjusting you</p>

<p class=""p1"">Or even if you're like ""what is yoga?"" or, like,  ""yoga..isn't that for like, skinny...vegan.. white actresses?""</p>
<p class=""p1"">You'll have bi-weekly webisodes to teach you about yoga and going through the asanas (the poses) - and learn that yoga isn't just for skinny..vegan..women, </p>
<p class=""p1"">but like bell hooks said of feminism, </p>
<p class=""p1"">Yoga is for everyone!</p>
<p class=""p1"">So in order for me to do this,</p>
<p class=""p1"">I need to get a proper digital camera -</p>
<p class=""p2"">Cause the one I have on my mac is kinda fuzzy and I want you to be able to really see me working through the poses so it's easier for..you</p>
<p class=""p1"">I'm looking to buy a 3rd Generation Flip UltraHD Video Camera,</p>
<p class=""p1"">A Tripod for that camera, so I can film myself </p>
<p class=""p1"">And a cheap (cheap!) version of Final Cut Pro to edit the videos so I can put them on the internet.</p>

<p><b><u>The Faith Challenge</u></b></p>
<p>As I am writing this I haven’t solved the eternal question
of Faith being it coming of a Christian, Muslim or atheistic. I can with certainly
say that Faith isn’t the easiest, and most mist understood thing in the world,
wars being fought over it, people killed and a general arguing point like the
one between me and my atheist friend who challenged me to do this</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I started 
the campaign to raise funds for The Faith challenge taking a jetski and motorbike across Europe and
Africa as the only transport doing equal 
amount of km on each 14000km in total .I wasn’t going to spread any
religions ,just see what need is there ,make a documentary  ,daily Facebook and Twitter updates ,take
nice photos and show it to the world, and help a few people with funding as I proceeded.
I asked a lot of my friends to help me; I do have a lot of friends Christians and
atheist. as we continued into the final 
stages of the project a few things happened ,I saw people that wanted to
help and give support ,and then I saw what my friend called paper Facebook Christians
,Muslims and atheist as we have space on our campaign for all the above challenging
each other to a small amount and reposting it and nominating a friend to a
donation ,I must say we have 40 days left and I am shocked as I was browsing
and checking out religion pages the amount off likes and the fighting that goes
on in the comment columns .it is true what he said that Christian on Face book
post nice stuff but they will not contribute ,Muslims  like to fight for their religion and don’t donate,
they are really passionate and I respect them for that ,Atheist they like to
prove we are wrong ,but won’t put their money where their mouths is .I am
attacking nobody and I am just very grateful for the lesson I have learnt out
off this ,I am fasting for 30 days now ,hunger isn’t easy and that the Lord has
given me the Faith In Him and if I had to put my Faith in the world I would be
in deep trouble .I have asked hundreds of people to join ,asked  Religious pages to post my link ,they have
ignored me I am taking it on the chin I may not succeed in the Faith challenge

Our products are put on the market as special cosmetics in China (similar to Quasi-Drug Label in Japan), but special cosmetics cannot be advertised as a drug for treating hair loss problem, so the product won’t be known by customers or recognized by doctors even it can solve the problem of hair loss. That’s the reason <b>we decide to apply to the FDA for investigational new drug (IND) and new drug applications (NDA).</b></p><h2><b>Why Do We Want Crowdfunding?</b></h2><p>About two out of ten Chinese adult males experience hair loss, while about one out of twenty adult women does. Therefore in China it is estimated that there are 65 million men and 15 million women are suffering hair loss. In the United States about four out of seven adult males are suffering hair loss.</p><p>There are an estimated 40 million men and 12 million women experiencing some degree of hair loss in the United States alone.

We will raise funds by crowdfunding and fill the gap by other means.</p><h2><b>Reasons for Androgenetic Alopecia</b></h2><p>Male hormone translates into DHT which will block the hair follicle regeneration. DHT can make obstacles in the process of hair follicle stem cells translating into hair follicle cells, preventing hair follicle regeneration, thus regenerated hair follicles keep shrinking until disappear.</p><p>The study found that hair follicle stem cells in hair loss area are normal, so hair follicle stem cells loss is not the main cause of hair loss (<a href=""http://www.jci.org/articles/view/44478"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.jci.org/articles/view/44478"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">learn more about the study</a>).</p><p>There are two possible ways of DHT blocking hair follicle regeneration process: 1. DHT leads to the hyperplasia and enlargement of sebaceous gland near the top of  head, as with DHT leads to the prostate enlargement of male, which squeezes the survival space of the hair follicles, therefore stopping hair follicle regeneration after normal falling off; 2. After the cycle of hair follicle anagen, catagen and telogen, the body will give hair follicle stem cells the right stimulation signal, initiating the hair follicle stem cells regeneration process but DHT accumulation interferes or disrupts the signal transmission, thus blocking the regeneration process of hair follicle stem cells differentiating into hair follicle cells.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1370904/files/20150410001443-22.jpg?1428650083"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1378001/files/20150412221019-reason.jpg?1428901819"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Both two ways lead to the same result: sebaceous gland cells encroach on the space of hair follicles, thus hair loss area is not only very oily (that’s why every hair loser has this problem), and making hair follicle regeneration lose physical space and more difficult.</p><h2><b>Androgenetic Alopecia Treatment Difficulties</b></h2><p>1. <b>How to make physical space for hair follicles.</b> The long process of hair loss with hair follicles falling off, and sebaceous glands cells gradually occupy the space of the hair follicle. The simple physical logic tells us that physical space must be made for hair follicle for its regeneration. If see some effective hair regrowth technologies, such as hair transplant surgery, you will find the most simple idea of providing specific space for hair follicle is man-made wound.</p><p>The study found that man-made wound healing process will produce new hair follicle stem cells group and new hair (<a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7142/abs/nature05766.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7142/abs/nature05766.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">learn more about the study</a>).</p><p>From hair transplant surgery we will find that hair follicles in transplantation area can regenerate after being removed. But in the hair loss area, making new pores and transplanting new hair follicles which all fall off after 3 months. The regenerated hair follicles in hair loss area should have nothing to do with transplanted hair follicles. The man-made bigger wound for new pore is the key to regenerate hair follicles in hair transplant surgery.</p><p>Talents of Chinese people with traditional Chinese medicine experience and exploration also provide an effective way of hair regrowth. That is using plum needle to knock on the head. Almost all Chinese medicine hair regrowth shops, no matter what kind of Chinese traditional medicine they choose use plum needle head knocking as supplementary means. In fact, knocking on the head with plum needle is the only solution of hair regrowth that might work. Because plum needle which knocking on the hair loss area can make a lot of wounds. Even without stem cells stimulation, it may also be accompanied by new hair follicle regeneration during the wounds heal.</p><p>2. <b>How to initiate hair follicles regeneration by hair follicle stem cells.</b> Modern medicines generally use cytokines to stimulate stem cell regeneration process. The special stem cells need special cytokines to stimulate them.

<h2><b>FAQ</b></h2>
<p><b>Why WanBinCell Works So Quickly?</b></p>
<p>New hair can regrow in about 5 days in half bald area. This is because WanBinCell contains stem cell initiators factors. They penetrate scalp, reach hair follicle stem cells, and stimulate the stem cells to grow new hair follicles. Wound will heal in 5 days, with the factors, new hair follicles could regeneration 5 days. In half bald area, hair follicles and their living space still exist, therefore new hair follicles have space to grow quickly.</p>
<p><b>Why It has Slower Effect in Bald Area?</b></p>
<p>In bald area, there are almost no hair follicles; their space has been taken up by sebaceous gland cells. Even there are stem cell regeneration stimulate factors, it is impossible to have regenerated hair follicles because of the limited physical space. So it works slowly in bald area. But by continuously creating man-made micro wounds, hair follicles will have physical space for survival. Generally in 1 to 3 months, healthy thick new hair can regrow even in bald area.</p>
<p><b>Why Have Severe Shedding Period? Can it Be Avoided?</b></p>
<p>Physical space is still the key point to solve the problem of Androgenetic alopecia. Because there are limited physical space and old hair follicles have not been cleared, new hair follicles could not regenerate. Natural regeneration of hair follicles is a process that new hair follicles replace old hair follicles which are in telogen. In fact, severe Shedding of hair exists in all effective products, such as Minoxidil and Finasteride. In the first 3 months after an effective hair transplant surgery, hairs grow from new transplant hair follicles will fall off entirely. Now it is inevitable and must be accepted. This period also has psychological impact. Different from transplant surgery, using WanBinCell does not need to shave all the old hair. Shedding period especially long hair fall off give shocks, while new hair grow in the speed of 1mm/3 days.</p>
<p><b>How Woman Avoid Severe Shedding Period?</b></p>
<p>Due to woman’s hair loss generally is not as serious as man, we recommend you to use plum needle and reduce the use time of WanBinCell. For example use WanBinCell for one week (7 days), select one day from this week to knock head with plum needle, then stop for a week, and keep doing it. Even men can use this method to avoid Shedding period. For men who can accept the period, using plum needle once a week is also helpful.</p>
<p><b>Severe Shedding Periods Due to Hair Being Burned off?</b></p>
<p>Because of the need to make tiny wounds, WanBinCell has a little corrosion effect. Corrosion effect is similar to hydrogen peroxide used in dyeing, but won’t burn out the hair for the following reasons: 1. If WanBinCell burns off hair, new hair won’t appear when using it. Even new hairs appear, it will not continue to grow. If you use it for 20 days, new hair can grow in 5 days, and generally reach 0.5 cm at 20th day; 2. If hair is burned off, it should not carry hair follicle, while actually most of the hairs fall off with hair follicles thicker than hair; 3. If it burns off hair, the original hair will grow naturally. It’s impossible to have a lot of new hair grow when stop using WanBinCell for 1 to 2 months. The truth is after using WanBinCell for 20 days, then stop, new hair will grow unceasingly after 1 to 2 month.</p>
<p><b>Why Hair Regrowth Takes Such a Long Time?</b></p>
<p>It has been found that it takes about 1 to 2 years to recover to no hair loss appearance by using WanBinCell. Since WanBinCell do not require continuous use, the overall use time is about 1 year. Hair regrowth is a big challenge. Before our in situ tissue regeneration technology, hair transplant surgery, as an effective means, requires more than six months to achieve hair regrowth. The first 3 months is shedding period and other 3 months growing period. Actually it takes 8 months for hair to grow in all transplant area. Our in situ tissue regeneration technology solves two hair loss problems: create hair follicle regeneration space and stimulate hair follicle stem cells to regenerate hair follicles. Even so, as an aging problem, hair loss cannot be solved in 1 to 2 months. In the consideration of hair loss usually lasting time of 5 to 10 years and hair loss area are completely different from healthy area, it is reasonable to rebuild a new healthy in 1-2 years.</p>
<p><b>Are Other Drugs Needed when Using WanBinCell?</b></p>
<p>WanBinCell can fully solve hair loss from essential problem. Long-term use can cure hair loss. Therefore it’s not recommended to use other drugs together, but we suggest to use plum needle. If used properly, it is quite beneficial to hair (for example, knocking as heavily as possible to make scalp bleed if pain could be tolerated).</p>
<p><b>What Advantages of Using Plum Needle?</b></p>
<p>One difficulty of Androgenetic alopecia treatment is how to provide physical space for the generation of new hair follicles. Although WanBinCell can make tiny wounds, but the size and number of wounds could not reach the requirements of fast hair regrowth. We have learned that man-made large wounds of hair transplant surgery can theoretically accelerate hair follicle regeneration process. So when knocking head with plum needle, we suggest that if you can tolerate, please knock as heavily as possible and make scalp bleed. There is no need to worry about the infection of wounds, because WanBinCell contains a substance similar to the ROS, a material could avoid infection and accelerate wound healing.</p>
<p><b>Is WanBinCell Safe?</b></p>
<p>WanBinCell had been inspected by qualified inspection agency, conforming to the safety specifications, and is a special cosmetic product examined and approved by State Food and Drug Administration of China. Actually we have done a more rigorous safety testing, therefore we can confirm that WanBinCell can be taken orally or by intramuscular injection without any side effects (<a href=""https://vimeo.com/123405399?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=clip-transcode_complete-finished-20120100&amp;utm_campaign=7701&amp;email_id=Y2xpcF90cmFuc2NvZGVkfDNlYzQ4ZWU5ODU5MTdkNjU0Y2U0YWIyOGIzNjAwZDlhMzU3fDM4NzQ5NTUzfDE0Mjc0NjU0ODl8NzcwMQ%3D%3D"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://vimeo.com/123405399"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">watch the video of the inventor test WanBinCell safety on himself</a>).</p>

<p><b>Why Using WanBinCell could Cause Piercing Pain? Is It Unqualified As Cosmetics?</b></p>
<p>Having no space for the new hair follicle is the key problem of hair loss. So solving the problem of hair loss must create space for new hair follicles. It’s a logical thinking that WanBinCell use chemicals to create tiny wounds. Wounds will naturally bring pain which shouldn’t be thought as a standard to judge for good cosmetics. In the United States, WanBinCell has to be put on the market as a medicine. We have applied for a patent in the United States. Piercing pain is an important mechanism process of medicine, rather than side effect.</p>
<p><b>Why Need 1-2 Years to Get Fully Recovery?</b></p>
<p>Androgenetic alopecia is one of the forms of aging, which develops relatively slow, generally obvious hair loss takes five to ten years to appear. It has long disease course and treatment time. There is still no very effective treatment for Androgenetic alopecia except hair transplant surgery with relatively fast effect (recovery also needs about 8 months), Minoxidil and Finasteride need longer time to take effect, and need to be applied for a long time. Comparatively speaking, WanBinCell technology is also the most rapid one by only taking 1-2 years to recover.</p>

</div><p></p></div>","We invented a material for fast hair growth by chance ensuring hair regrowth appearance in just five days. The material is designed as cosmetics and acquired special cosmetics qualification in China. For the material’s hair regrowth function, we have already applied for the patent in China, United States, European Union and Japan.Androgenetic alopeciais a problem which 50% men and 10% women will be faced. Aging process faced by each person could initiate with hair loss for some people. Same with aging, hair loss is also a difficult medical problem. Our hair regrowth invention (US2015/0004254A1) has potential to thoroughly solve hair loss problem, and are likely to offer a cure idea for other complicated diseases. Our products are put on the market as special cosmetics in China (similar to Quasi-Drug Label in Japan), but special cosmetics cannot be advertised as a drug for treating hair loss problem, so the product won’t be known by customers or recognized by doctors even it can solve the problem of hair loss. That’s the reason we decide to apply to the FDA for investigational new drug (IND) and new drug applications (NDA).Why Do We Want Crowdfunding?About two out of ten Chinese adult males experience hair loss, while about one out of twenty adult women does. Therefore in China it is estimated that there are 65 million men and 15 million women are suffering hair loss. In the United States about four out of seven adult males are suffering hair loss.There are an estimated 40 million men and 12 million women experiencing some degree of hair loss in the United States alone. Two-thirds of American men will see the affects of Androgenetic alopecia by the age of 35.In order to meet such a large market demand, we decided to launch this crowdfunding.The crowdfunding will be used for the production, while the rest of the money will be used for preclinical study, phase I clinical research and application to the FDA for clinical tests.The cost of FDA application for preclinical trials and phase I clinical study is estimated as $2 million. We will raise funds by crowdfunding and fill the gap by other means.Reasons for Androgenetic AlopeciaMale hormone translates into DHT which will block the hair follicle regeneration. DHT can make obstacles in the process of hair follicle stem cells translating into hair follicle cells, preventing hair follicle regeneration, thus regenerated hair follicles keep shrinking until disappear.The study found that hair follicle stem cells in hair loss area are normal, so hair follicle stem cells loss is not the main cause of hair loss (learn more about the study).There are two possible ways of DHT blocking hair follicle regeneration process: 1. DHT leads to the hyperplasia and enlargement of sebaceous gland near the top of  head, as with DHT leads to the prostate enlargement of male, which squeezes the survival space of the hair follicles, therefore stopping hair follicle regeneration after normal falling off; 2. After the cycle of hair follicle anagen, catagen and telogen, the body will give hair follicle stem cells the right stimulation signal, initiating the hair follicle stem cells regeneration process but DHT accumulation interferes or disrupts the signal transmission, thus blocking the regeneration process of hair follicle stem cells differentiating into hair follicle cells.Both two ways lead to the same result: sebaceous gland cells encroach on the space of hair follicles, thus hair loss area is not only very oily (that’s why every hair loser has this problem), and making hair follicle regeneration lose physical space and more difficult.Androgenetic Alopecia Treatment Difficulties1. How to make physical space for hair follicles. The long process of hair loss with hair follicles falling off, and sebaceous glands cells gradually occupy the space of the hair follicle. The simple physical logic tells us that physical space must be made for hair follicle for its regeneration. If see some effective hair regrowth technologies, such as hair transplant surgery, you will find the most simple idea of providing specific space for hair follicle is man-made wound.The study found that man-made wound healing process will produce new hair follicle stem cells group and new hair (learn more about the study).From hair transplant surgery we will find that hair follicles in transplantation area can regenerate after being removed. But in the hair loss area, making new pores and transplanting new hair follicles which all fall off after 3 months. The regenerated hair follicles in hair loss area should have nothing to do with transplanted hair follicles. The man-made bigger wound for new pore is the key to regenerate hair follicles in hair transplant surgery.Talents of Chinese people with traditional Chinese medicine experience and exploration also provide an effective way of hair regrowth. That is using plum needle to knock on the head. Almost all Chinese medicine hair regrowth shops, no matter what kind of Chinese traditional medicine they choose use plum needle head knocking as supplementary means. In fact, knocking on the head with plum needle is the only solution of hair regrowth that might work. Because plum needle which knocking on the hair loss area can make a lot of wounds. Even without stem cells stimulation, it may also be accompanied by new hair follicle regeneration during the wounds heal.2. How to initiate hair follicles regeneration by hair follicle stem cells. Modern medicines generally use cytokines to stimulate stem cell regeneration process. The special stem cells need special cytokines to stimulate them. But now there is no broad spectrum stimulating factor being found.How Does WanBinCell work?WanBinCell initiative in situ tissue regeneration technology is to cure hair loss by aiming at the two difficulties of Androgenetic alopecia treatment, and is able to cure quickly and keep a long-term health.In situ tissue regeneration technology is to initiate body’s original stem cell proliferation, migration and differentiation by external physical or chemical means, thus fulfill regeneration of new healthy tissues.In Situ Tissue Regeneration TechnologyOur patent provides a method of initiating mammal’s stem cell proliferation, migration and differentiation. This method can persistently initiate in situ stem cells proliferation, migration and differentiation with minimal or no side effects. We have not only developed the theory of “in situ tissue regeneration”, but also invented the method which can timely initiate tissue regeneration of stem cells near damaged tissues, so as to cure the disease or restore young tissues. (learn more about the in situ tissue regeneration technology patent).MechanismDrugs(stem cell initiators) are used on the targeted aging or damage tissues. Stem cell initiators will initiate healthy tissue regeneration of stem cells through three functions: 1. Stem cell initiators remove damaged or senescent cells, and make specific space for tissue regeneration; 2. Stem cell initiators as exogenous gas signal molecule activate stem cell proliferation, migration and differentiation; 3. Stem cell initiators regulate the immune response, to avoid infection. Under the induce of specific space, damaged tissues or surrounded normal stem cells regenerate new functional young tissues through proliferation, migration and differentiation. Impaired cells are removed as making room for tissue regeneration. Disease is cured and young tissues are restored by new tissues replacing impaired ones.Further studies have indicated that stem cell initiator is a substance similar to ROS. Targeted drug delivery is equivalent to supplement exogenous similar ROS compounds into the target tissue. The latest study has found that improving the level of ROS could accelerate apoptosis of cancer cells and reach the goal of anticancer（For example:1. Targeting Oxidative Stress in Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma; 2. Antioxidants Accelerate Lung Cancer Progression in Mice; 3. Selective killing of cancer cells with a small molecule targeting stress response to ROS; 4. Breaking the depth dependency of phototherapy with Cerenkov radiation and low-radiance-responsive nanophotosensitizers.）; improving ROS could regulate immune response and treat autoimmune diseases(For example: 1. A New Arthritis Therapy with Oxidative Burst Inducers; 2. Eriocalyxin B ameliorates experimental autoimmune ncephalomyelitis by suppressing Th1 and Th17 cells.); increasing ROS level contributes to tissue regeneration(For example: 1. Amputation-induced reactive oxygen species are required for successful Xenopus tadpole tail regeneration; 2. Sustained production of ROS triggers compensatory proliferation and is required for regeneration to proceed). The three patents we applied cover three possible mechanisms of ROS, suggesting that the substance which similar to ROS can play the same role of ROS. We applied apoptosis inducer patent for substance similar to ROS (learn more about apoptosis inducer patent) used for anti-aging and tumor treatment.Advantages of In Situ Tissue Regeneration TechnologyIt is a kind of stem cell therapy which makes full use of stem cell regeneration ability; Stem cells can be found in any tissue, so we can initiate in situ stem cells with no need of transplant; No need of complicated process of selection and induction; Make full use of original stem cell micro environment; No carcinogenicity and won’t cause immune rejection; Simple, high success rate, widely used, low cost and convenient.How Does WanBinCell Hair-Growth-Promoting Solution Regrow Hair?WanBinCell contains the substance which can activate the hair follicle stem cells to regenerate, having two key functions in the process of hair regrowth: 1. Make tiny wounds thus providing specific space for new hair follicles; 2. activate hair follicle stem cells in hair loss area and grow new healthy hair follicles.Through experiment, WanBinCell has the following characteristics: regrow new hair in about 5 days; in half bald area, fierce hair loss period shall appear by the accelerated falling off (the severe shedding period )of original hair especially the thin ones, then new hair regrow; in bald area, new hair regrowth takes a longer time of about 1 to 3 months; no matter what the degree of hair loss is, WanBinCell shall be used for more than over one year to make sure of no hair loss appearance.What Does WanBinCell Bring to the World?In situ tissue regeneration technique has made a great breakthrough in traditional stem cell therapy. It can be applied as a clinical therapy immediately. It makes full use of the potential of stem cell regeneration which could cure many difficult diseases. Combined with apoptosis inducer patent technology, it is more powerful in anti-aging and cancer treatment.CompareThere are three well-known solutions for Androgenetic alopecia: Finasteride, Minoxidil and Hair Transplant Surgery.Case In this video, our case studies include hair regrowth, alopecia areata, psoriasis, Vitiligo (Hair regrowth and in situ tissue regeneration  cases).

FAQ
Why WanBinCell Works So Quickly?
New hair can regrow in about 5 days in half bald area. This is because WanBinCell contains stem cell initiators factors. They penetrate scalp, reach hair follicle stem cells, and stimulate the stem cells to grow new hair follicles. Wound will heal in 5 days, with the factors, new hair follicles could regeneration 5 days. In half bald area, hair follicles and their living space still exist, therefore new hair follicles have space to grow quickly.
Why It has Slower Effect in Bald Area?
In bald area, there are almost no hair follicles; their space has been taken up by sebaceous gland cells. Even there are stem cell regeneration stimulate factors, it is impossible to have regenerated hair follicles because of the limited physical space. So it works slowly in bald area. But by continuously creating man-made micro wounds, hair follicles will have physical space for survival. Generally in 1 to 3 months, healthy thick new hair can regrow even in bald area.
Why Have Severe Shedding Period? Can it Be Avoided?
Physical space is still the key point to solve the problem of Androgenetic alopecia. Because there are limited physical space and old hair follicles have not been cleared, new hair follicles could not regenerate. Natural regeneration of hair follicles is a process that new hair follicles replace old hair follicles which are in telogen. In fact, severe Shedding of hair exists in all effective products, such as Minoxidil and Finasteride. In the first 3 months after an effective hair transplant surgery, hairs grow from new transplant hair follicles will fall off entirely. Now it is inevitable and must be accepted. This period also has psychological impact. Different from transplant surgery, using WanBinCell does not need to shave all the old hair. Shedding period especially long hair fall off give shocks, while new hair grow in the speed of 1mm/3 days.
How Woman Avoid Severe Shedding Period?
Due to woman’s hair loss generally is not as serious as man, we recommend you to use plum needle and reduce the use time of WanBinCell. For example use WanBinCell for one week (7 days), select one day from this week to knock head with plum needle, then stop for a week, and keep doing it. Even men can use this method to avoid Shedding period. For men who can accept the period, using plum needle once a week is also helpful.
Severe Shedding Periods Due to Hair Being Burned off?
Because of the need to make tiny wounds, WanBinCell has a little corrosion effect. Corrosion effect is similar to hydrogen peroxide used in dyeing, but won’t burn out the hair for the following reasons: 1. If WanBinCell burns off hair, new hair won’t appear when using it. Even new hairs appear, it will not continue to grow. If you use it for 20 days, new hair can grow in 5 days, and generally reach 0.5 cm at 20th day; 2. If hair is burned off, it should not carry hair follicle, while actually most of the hairs fall off with hair follicles thicker than hair; 3. If it burns off hair, the original hair will grow naturally. It’s impossible to have a lot of new hair grow when stop using WanBinCell for 1 to 2 months. The truth is after using WanBinCell for 20 days, then stop, new hair will grow unceasingly after 1 to 2 month.
Why Hair Regrowth Takes Such a Long Time?
It has been found that it takes about 1 to 2 years to recover to no hair loss appearance by using WanBinCell. Since WanBinCell do not require continuous use, the overall use time is about 1 year. Hair regrowth is a big challenge. Before our in situ tissue regeneration technology, hair transplant surgery, as an effective means, requires more than six months to achieve hair regrowth. The first 3 months is shedding period and other 3 months growing period. Actually it takes 8 months for hair to grow in all transplant area. Our in situ tissue regeneration technology solves two hair loss problems: create hair follicle regeneration space and stimulate hair follicle stem cells to regenerate hair follicles. Even so, as an aging problem, hair loss cannot be solved in 1 to 2 months. In the consideration of hair loss usually lasting time of 5 to 10 years and hair loss area are completely different from healthy area, it is reasonable to rebuild a new healthy in 1-2 years.
Are Other Drugs Needed when Using WanBinCell?
WanBinCell can fully solve hair loss from essential problem. Long-term use can cure hair loss. Therefore it’s not recommended to use other drugs together, but we suggest to use plum needle. If used properly, it is quite beneficial to hair (for example, knocking as heavily as possible to make scalp bleed if pain could be tolerated).
What Advantages of Using Plum Needle?
One difficulty of Androgenetic alopecia treatment is how to provide physical space for the generation of new hair follicles. Although WanBinCell can make tiny wounds, but the size and number of wounds could not reach the requirements of fast hair regrowth. We have learned that man-made large wounds of hair transplant surgery can theoretically accelerate hair follicle regeneration process. So when knocking head with plum needle, we suggest that if you can tolerate, please knock as heavily as possible and make scalp bleed. There is no need to worry about the infection of wounds, because WanBinCell contains a substance similar to the ROS, a material could avoid infection and accelerate wound healing.
Is WanBinCell Safe?
WanBinCell had been inspected by qualified inspection agency, conforming to the safety specifications, and is a special cosmetic product examined and approved by State Food and Drug Administration of China. Actually we have done a more rigorous safety testing, therefore we can confirm that WanBinCell can be taken orally or by intramuscular injection without any side effects (watch the video of the inventor test WanBinCell safety on himself).

Why Using WanBinCell could Cause Piercing Pain? Is It Unqualified As Cosmetics?
Having no space for the new hair follicle is the key problem of hair loss. So solving the problem of hair loss must create space for new hair follicles. It’s a logical thinking that WanBinCell use chemicals to create tiny wounds. Wounds will naturally bring pain which shouldn’t be thought as a standard to judge for good cosmetics. In the United States, WanBinCell has to be put on the market as a medicine. We have applied for a patent in the United States. Piercing pain is an important mechanism process of medicine, rather than side effect.
Why Need 1-2 Years to Get Fully Recovery?
Androgenetic alopecia is one of the forms of aging, which develops relatively slow, generally obvious hair loss takes five to ten years to appear. It has long disease course and treatment time. There is still no very effective treatment for Androgenetic alopecia except hair transplant surgery with relatively fast effect (recovery also needs about 8 months), Minoxidil and Finasteride need longer time to take effect, and need to be applied for a long time. Comparatively speaking, WanBinCell technology is also the most rapid one by only taking 1-2 years to recover.

<h3><b>You
want scientific data?</b></h3>
<p>Scientific data shows that 50% to 60% of men
aged 50 or more suffer from <span>benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH), a benign increase in size of the prostate. Furthermore,
prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer found in North
American men and the second-leading cause of death in men. </span><b><a href=""http://diagnocure.com/docs/news/306.2010-09-21_PCA3_filed_with_the_US_FDA.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://diagnocure.com/docs/news/306.2010-09-21_PCA3_filed_with_the_US_FDA.pdf</span></a></b></p>
<p>The prostate is a gland normally thesize <span>of
a walnut that sits over the neck of the bladder. Prostatic
difficulties and erectile dysfunction are closely related to testosterone
deficiency. While aging, men produce less and less testosterone. In fact, the
rate of testosterone production decreases from the age of 30, and then is
reduced by 10% per decade. It is therefore important to prevent any condition
that may be triggered by taking the appropriate measures consisting of an
integrated strategy promoting effective prevention. </span><b>ProstaBoost</b>
is that ounce of prevention that is better than a pound of cure.</p>
<p><b>Percentage of men suffering from <span>BPH:</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">30% of men aged 50</span><br/></b></li>
<li><b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">50% of men aged 60</span><br/></b></li>
<li><b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">80% of men aged 70 and more</span><br/></b></li>
</ul>
<p>As you get older, BPH is more and more prevalent in men. <b>ProstaBoost </b>is the best
protection!<i>  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">(References below)</span></i></p>

</div></div>","ProstaBoost, for men, naturally!
You have prostate problems? You are beginning
to age and you are concerned with the health of your prostate? You feel worried
about intimate moments and it affects your comfort and self-esteem?
Think for a minute about not having any
worries about your prostate, feeling easy about yourself and your intimate
desires. Think about sensuous moments without any biological barriers, one of
these almost perfect experiences when you are at your best sexually. Wouldn’t
that make you happy?

ProstaBoost,
simple yet powerful!
ProstaBoost can make it happen for you. Made
with natural ingredients (urtica dioica,
serenoa repens and lipidium meyenii),
added to an antioxidant (lycopene), it
will work its power in three ways:



improves you sexual health;


increases your prostatic
functions; and


acts as a natural
antioxidant.





ProstaBoost,
who are we?

Medica
Avenue Inc. is a Canadian nutraceutical products
company that is dedicated to developing, analyzing, assessing, producing and marketing
innovative health products. We are committed to research for new natural health
products that are effective and safe, and that deliver what they promise. We
only use the purest ingredients from the best suppliers. All of our products
have been examined and have received the Health Canada standards approval.                                                   Rock LeBel is the founder and CEO.

ProstaBoost,
it works!
ProstaBoost, is the combination you need to:




relieve urologic symptoms
such as: reduced amount of urine passed, incomplete emptying, nocturnal and
diurnal polyuria associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, moderate or
severe;


provide your system with
antioxidants that help maintaining prostatic health;


help you improve the energy
and emotional components associated to sexual health. 





You
want scientific data?
Scientific data shows that 50% to 60% of men
aged 50 or more suffer from benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH), a benign increase in size of the prostate. Furthermore,
prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer found in North
American men and the second-leading cause of death in men. http://diagnocure.com/docs/news/306.2010-09-21_PCA3_filed_with_the_US_FDA.pdf
The prostate is a gland normally thesize of
a walnut that sits over the neck of the bladder. Prostatic
difficulties and erectile dysfunction are closely related to testosterone
deficiency. While aging, men produce less and less testosterone. In fact, the
rate of testosterone production decreases from the age of 30, and then is
reduced by 10% per decade. It is therefore important to prevent any condition
that may be triggered by taking the appropriate measures consisting of an
integrated strategy promoting effective prevention. ProstaBoost
is that ounce of prevention that is better than a pound of cure.
Percentage of men suffering from BPH:


30% of men aged 50
50% of men aged 60
80% of men aged 70 and more

As you get older, BPH is more and more prevalent in men. ProstaBoost is the best
protection!  (References below)


Let's talk about erectile dysfunction!
Erectile dysfunctions as
well as urinary stress incontinence are disorders that seem to be closely
related to prostate problems. These problems may have serious negative impacts
on self-esteem and intimate relationships. This is why maintaining prostatic
health is essential.
Symptoms suggesting that you
should use ProstaBoost:


Weak urinary stream;
Inability to empty the bladder completely;
Frequent need to urinate;
Unpleasant feeling of
heaviness and weight in the rectum or lower abdomen;
Frequent need to get up at night
to urinate;
Frequent difficulty to
ejaculate;

Erectile dysfunction.



ProstaBoost
can do even more!
While protecting your body against prostate
malfunction and providing strong natural antioxidants, ProstaBoost can actually
prevent severe prostate conditions.
ProstaBoost helps men by preventing prostate
problems. Make your life easier and use ProstaBoost. 
It is essentially made
with non-chemical ingredients, totally natural and remarkably efficient. Give
yourself a chance!

Shining Hope is a charity helping local communities live in harmony with nature and animals. It supports the Shechen clinic and its mobile clinics until 2015. They need an X-Ray machine to treat tuberculosis patients.
The Shechen Medical Centre and Mobile Clinic in Bodhgaya, India, brings free health care to the people of the Bihar region, the poorest state of India. Out of an average of 3000 patients per month, almost 80% of the patients are women and children.
The Mobile Clinic is an effective outreach program that regularly visits 18 villages located between 12 and 60 km from the medical centre and offers free health services to the region’s population of 100,000. Each village is visited twice a month by the medical mobile team (a doctor, a nurse, and a pharmacist). This is their only possibility to receive health care.
   What We Need & What You Get 


The full amount (£9000) is going towards that X-Ray machine.


If the goal is not reached a second hand machine will be purchased.


Remember, lives will be saved!



The Impact 
1000 people die of tuberculosis per day in India, and the disease is spreading. Families are torn apart, treating this disease will give them hope in the most remote village in the Bihar district of India.
We have already supported mobile camps for the Dalits caste in India, one of the poorest. This was their only hope to receive health care. Tuberculosis remains a very common disease locally and we could not continue our outreach effort without this machine.

Risks & Challenges
 
100% of your donation will go towards buying that machine.
A generous donor is paying for our admin cost, so if you give £10, £10 will go towards the project. 

  Other Ways You Can Help 
You can share that campaign, talk about tuberculosis, our luck not to be exposed by this type of disease on our homeland.

<h3>I am Castillo, a 26 year old transgender man living in
Austin, Texas. I started binding my chest when I was 16. Since taking
testosterone, I am seen more and more by the world as a man. For the sake of my
safety, I do not leave my house without a binder. In concealing my breasts, a
binder also makes it difficult to breathe, exercise or stand upright. </h3>
<p>Aside from discomfort, having breasts feels so foreign. My
chest is off limits. It is like having landmines on your chest that you are
constantly being reminded of. Swimming, biking, yoga and weight lifting are all important parts of my stress management routine and not being able to do those things is tough. </p>
<p>I know these things might sounds arbitrary, but ultimately,
this surgery would allow for me to feel comfortable. Comfort in the safety of
not being “found out” if my breasts become visible. It will give me the comfort
of confidently standing in front of a mirror, exercise freely and be touched by
my partner.</p>
<p>As a full time student I am not able to pay for this
procedure alone. I work part time to afford basic necessities, but saving for
this surgery would take me years. 9,000 dollars is an unfathomable amount of
money for me right now. Your contribution to my fundraiser, of any amount,
would be such a blessing. With a part-time job, bills and school, the money I have raised for this is all being invested in to this fundraising venture.</p>
<p>Last November I came out to my family as a transgender man.
My mother and father were both incredibly supportive. I have been lucky enough
in my life to have found support from my friends, family, peers and some,
employers. While giving a speech at the Trans Day of Remembrance I looked out
in to a sea of faces that made my journey realizable. Sitting in that crowd
hearing people share their stories of loss and unacceptance made me realize how
lucky I have been to have such incredibly supportive people in my life.  As a trans person of color I am the anomaly.
Not many trans people of color have similar experiences to my own. We are
affected by homelessness, employment discrimination, suicide and violence at
disproportionate rates. In knowing that, I couldn’t just fundraise for myself. </p>
<p>The Jim Collins fund raises money to help transgender people
receive gender confirming surgeries they wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford.</p>

I used to wear a breast binder before I had kids, but I had to stop binding in 2008 because I passed out at work from not being able to breathe and my coworkers had to cut it off of me (Awkward!).

There under a tree sat Wilson in a broken wheelchair, watching the sun set with the biggest smile I have ever seen.  When I asked why Percy his wife wasn't there at the hospital caring for him, I was informed she was three hours away in the village working as a school teacher. She had to work  so she could support them all, sending money to their relatives so they could buy Wilson's medicine and pay for catheters. Percy and Wilson hadn't seen each other in months as they couldn't afford the transportation. The best days for Wilson were when he could hear his wife's voice on the phone.  Right before Wilson became paralyzed, Percy gave birth to a healthy baby girl named Favor. For Percy this meant she was still nursing, caring for their other three children, and working to care via long distance for her paralyzed husband. Percy is a loyal and nurturing wife and mother. </span></p>

This is a campaign for Debbie Barr, and she was born with only one kidney. In September 2011 after a lifetime of struggling with continued illnesses, including over 30+ surgeries, that kidney failed. She is currently on dialysis 3 times per week, 4 hours a session. While she has completed all of the testing required to be placed on the kidney transplant list, they are now requiring her to have an account set up with the funds set aside to pay for the expensive anti-rejection medications that will be required after the transplant.

<p>This message is to save my son.</p>
<p>In August, 2009 Casey Strale entered a team into an Ironman tournament.  For those unfamiliar with the concept, an Ironman requires a roller hockey team to play with no subs, the same players on the floor for the entire game. To say it’s a game for those with extreme stamina is an understatement.  Casey Strale was known around the Irvine facility ‘The Rinks’ as a player with that required stamina.  Most of all he was known for his passion for the sport of hockey.  It was his favorite thing to do and you could often find him honing his game at all hours of the day.  His work ethic was magnetic: “He is the first one at the rink and his love of hockey is what makes everyone love him,” said his coach Dave Cairns.</p>
<p>It was at this Ironman tournament that Casey began to feel more winded than before.  His usual reserve of stamina was wearing out and he found himself worn out by the end of games.   Casey headed to see a doctor for an ultrasound on Tuesday, September 22, 2009 and what he was told was nothing short of serious.  Casey had Cancer.  His casual Tuesday visit to doctor led to surgery that following Friday.  A grapefruit sized tumor had grown on his left kidney.  In surgery, the diagnoses was grave; his prognosis, Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma, we were given a 15% chance of survival. Then Casey obtained the the title of ""The Miracle Boy"" being one of the only patients at the Children’s Hospital of Orange County to ever be on life support and survive coming off of it.  The same resolve that Casey displayed on the rink against the opposition was now going to battle against the toughest opponent that he ever laced up against.</p>
<p>At the present Casey has indured multiple surgeries, drug regimens and clinical trials, continues to battle his cancer and play hockey when his stregnth allows.  The last MRI showing new bylateral tumors now in his lungs. We continue to research to find new drugs and new ways to save our son.  He continues his treatment, meanwhile his doctors have continued to give their blessing to be able to play hockey. The same passion that he displays competing in every shift helps him in his everyday battle.  Sometimes winning Gold isn’t the worst thing in the world.  For Casey Strale his gold medal was just getting the chance to play.</p>

<h2><strong>My Story</strong></h2>
<p>I used to work in an office where food options were very limited.  Our cafeteria served food that wasn’t that great, and we usually had to drive to get food outside.  So I started packing my own lunch to work every day.  I would bring my own salad and develop my own salad dressings.  </p>
<p>My colleagues became so jealous of my salads that some of my closest friends asked me to pack an extra one for them and they’d pay me for the trouble.  Before I knew it, word got around and what used to be two extra salads a day became a small production line of twenty salads made fresh every morning.</p>

<p>And when my sales continued to grow, I knew I was on to something.  There was a market that was literally hungry for fresh, healthy food that was easily accessible to them.</p>

She has<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><strong>THE</strong><span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span>fiercest personality ever, it would make Tyra Banks jealous. About a year ago, she found the love of her life, a US Soldier. As a fellow military wife myself, I know how difficult military relationships can be at times. But her husband Perry is her strongest support. He has never left her side. Neither have her friends, her real friends. When you find out you have cancer at the age of 24, you learn who your real friends are. </span></p>
<p><span>The last 2 years Kenley has battled 7 different types of Cancer. She first learned she had cancer 8 years ago and battled against Leukemia and won. Her mother passed away in 2010 from Breast Cancer. She has been in and out of the ER, gone through countless weeks of chemo, a bone marrow transplant, and very sadly, lost their first baby in the second trimester. You name it. SEriously...just about anything and everything. I've never met such a fighter like her. She is almost always in high spirits being her crazy fun self. <em>She</em> is the one that inspires <em>us</em>. She'e been to hell and back, yet she's the one setting everything else on fire in her path that may get in her way. I've seriously never met a person with such perseverance as this woman. Her friend Dana has started this fundraising idea. I decided to help her spread the word. Kenley has done so much for Dana, as she has for all of us, we decided to do something for her now. </span></p>
<p><span>In May, my aunt passed away from Ovarian Cancer. Its almost undetectable until it's in it's fatal stages. I was so incredibly close to her and it breaks my heart to think about how it took her life and I refuse to sit by and let this stupid disease get to my friend, or any other person for that matter. As you can see, Kenley's go-get-em attitude has rubbed off on all of us. :)</span></p>
<p><span>After spreading a link of a Scentsy party to raise money originally, more people were asking me about just making a donation straight to her, rather than purchasing a product to make sure she gets 100% of their donation. One of my friend's told me about this site, so here we are.</span></p>
<p><span>100% of your donation will go to Kenley and Perry to help them pay medical bills. Yes, they have military health care but that doesn't cover costs like this with all they go through. On the 25th of September Kenley underwent a 16 hour brain surgery to have a recurring tumor removed, as well as more cancer in her jaw, esophagus, knee, spine, colon, cervix and stomach. This is one of the biggest surgeries she's had lately and she needs all the support she can get. She is not the type of person to ask for help at all. All she wants is a lot of junk food! :) She's never once complained and said ""Poor me."" Never. I don't know if I could be that strong, but this girl, she is Superwoman. </span></p>
<p><span>UPATE: 10/3: Today Kenley is having another surgery to remove the rest of the brain tumor that they couldn't remove during the massive surgery she had last week. After this, she will start on about 34 weeks of a new kind of chemo. They need every bit of support they can get right now.</span></p>
<p><span>Our goal is $1000 right now. If we hit it, or go over that would be AMAZING, the more for them, the less burden they will have. Anything and everything will help! No amount is too small! So if you can, we would be forever grateful for anything you donate to help her and her hubby and make the burden of bills a bit easier to bear. </span></p>
<p><span>I understand not everyone can contribute. If you can't, thoughts and prayers are welcome as always by all. Research cancer, and maybe do a Cancer run to raise awareness in your community, instead of posting a Facebook status on the color of your bra or where you hide your purse. <span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span>Thank you all so much for your time, donation and prayers. We will continue to keep everyone updated! </span></p></span></div>","I have known Kenley for several years now. She has THE fiercest personality ever, it would make Tyra Banks jealous.

So if you can, we would be forever grateful for anything you donate to help her and her hubby and make the burden of bills a bit easier to bear. 
I understand not everyone can contribute. If you can't, thoughts and prayers are welcome as always by all. Research cancer, and maybe do a Cancer run to raise awareness in your community, instead of posting a Facebook status on the color of your bra or where you hide your purse.  Thank you all so much for your time, donation and prayers. We will continue to keep everyone updated!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Don't Die. It's a 7500km journey from Mile Zero of the TransCanada Highway in Victoria BC, to the most eastern point of North America, Cape Spear. Which is just outisde of St. John's, Newfoundland. Why? Because I need to prove to myself that I can overcome any challenge if I set my mind to it.  Riding from one coast to another across the second largest country in the world in two months is a pretty big challenge, so if I can do this, I know I can do anything. </p><p>And a bigger resaon? I want to raise money and awareness for prostate cancer research.  My grandfather died from prostate cancer when I was young, and it left a pretty big hole. So it's a cause that's important to me.  And more than that, it's the most common form of cancer in Canadian men, if you exclude non-melanoma skin cancers. 1 in 7 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 1 in 28 will die from it, according to the Canadian Cancer Society.   So this isn't just a personal journey, it's also about raising awareness about prostate cancer, and to hopefully raise money to donate towards research.</p><p>But I need your help.  As you might imagine it's not cheap to do this. For one thing, there is a lot of gear that I need to buy in order to be able to survive on the road and stay in good physical shape. Then there's the issue of eating enough to stay healthy, as well as travelling to my start point in the first place. </p><p>So how much do I need? A pretty rough estimate would be between $2500, and $3000. It's hard to know exactly since I have never done this before and I can't say for certain how long it will take me, or how much I'll need to spend while I'm on the road. The only sure expenses right now are the things I need to buy just to be able to do this, and right now it looks like it'll be $1500 for all the gear. Some of which I have already bought. I'll get more into detail in a post on the trip journal page. </p><p>So here's what I'm asking: Any support you can give me, in any shape or amount, to help make this trip possible.  It could be financial support, or it could just be as simple as telling someone you know about it and getting them interested.

<p></p>The Fighting Gray Squirrels Wheelchair Rugby organization is a 
non-profit sports organization that offers people with physical 
disabilities and wheelchair rugby enthusiasts a home to play, compete 
and become socially involved within the sports community. This will 
assist in reducing social isolation, increasing community connectivity 
and improving mental health, a well-documented issue affecting those 
with spinal cord injuries<br/><br/>Funding Amount Requested: $8000.00<br/> 
Funds raised will be directly invested in the start up our therapy 
wheelchair rugby organization including the care and wellness of our 
quadriplegic participants, specialty sport wheelchairs, providing player
 sponsorships and maintaining our facility rental.<br/><br/>The Fighting 
Squirrels Wheelchair Rugby Organization is a therapeutic service for 
people with quadriplegic disabilities in the Halton Region for a source 
of recreation and sports. We are dedicated to enhancing the quality of 
life for young and adults with various physical, acquired and 
developmental disabilities.<br/><br/>The relationship between mental 
health and recreation is well documented. Recreation can assist with 
alleviating the symptoms of depression and anxiety,(Stathopoulou, 
Powers, Berry, Smits &amp; Otto, 2006) in both clinical populations and 
non clinical populations. What is lesser known is the relationship 
between people with spinal cord injuries and mental health. The 
incidence of mental health issues in people with spinal cord injuries is
 reported to be double that of the general population, with mental 
health issues affecting almost half of those injured (Migliorini, Tonge 
&amp; Taleporos, 2007) At this time there are no sports organizations 
for quadriplegics in the Halton community. Athletes are currently 
travelling as far as London or Toronto to take part in recreational 
activity. Quadriplegics in Halton have limited access to 
sports/recreational services, denying them the opportunity to improve 
their mental health through recreation.<br/><br/>The Fighting Squirrels 
will provide a local therapeutic wheelchair rugby team for disabled 
athletes to be part of. Everyone is included men, women, young and old. 
The team will increase social connectedness by fostering a team spirit 
where attitude is more important than aptitude. It will also provide an 
opportunity for quadriplegics to alleviate mental health symptoms 
through recreation, teamwork and healthy competition.<br/><br/>One way we 
will measure the project will be by having eight to ten athletes 
participate with the Fighting Squirrels organization. The second way we 
measure the success of the project will be by the player’s physical and 
mental state. If the disabled athletes are in a better physical and 
mental state the organization is a success. Physical tests like 
endurance, strength and co-ordination will be tested quarterly. Mental 
state is harder to test. We will look to see if the player’s report that
 their mood has elevated since joining the organization. Mental 
happiness consists of emotional response, satisfaction and general 
judgment about life. <br/><br/>We need to ensure that people with a 
disability have as much opportunity and choice to participate in sports 
regardless of where they live. Our involvement in the many issues 
surrounding mental health is based on our fundamental principles of 
participation in decision-making, citizenship and inclusion in community
 life. Therapeutic athletic activities with peer and family support 
promotes socialization, develops leadership skills, focus and physical 
fitness. People with various physical, acquired and developmental 
disabilities can experience mental illnesses like depression. Sometimes 
it can be difficult for us to understand how challenging it is for 
people with disabilities because we look at their problems through our 
eyes. The pressures of rehabilitation and feelings of acceptance by 
others can be very hard for some. It’s important that we remind 
ourselves that while their problems may seem unimportant to us, they can
 feel overwhelming to young and adults with a disability. It’s important
 to take depression in those with disabilities seriously.<br/><br/>We hope you can help us out and reach our goal. Anything would help large or small.<br/><br/>Thank you.<p></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Andrew was diagnosed in September with late stage Neuroendocratic Cancer in his Pancreas and Liver. He is only 31 years old. This devastating blow came at a point in Andrew's life in which he has so many things to be proud of. He moved to New Mexico to be near his dad last year. He was working multiple jobs, just met the love of his life and was loving the outdoors and the mountains that he now called home. After his diagnosis Andrew is deteriorating rapidly. He has lost a massive amount of weight, he now weighs less than he did in the 7th grade. He can't eat, quite literally. He has no energy. He can't go out and enjoy his mountains and worst of all he can't work. </p>
<p>Andrew went to the ER with bad stomach pain in September. This is where he was diagnosed. That day he was moved from Taos to Santa Fe where he spent time in the hospital undergoing tests. Upon his release he had to move back in with his dad, his money was gone, he could not work and he could not keep his apartment. His dad also drained his savings to help Andrew, hotel rooms, medicine, time off work they all take a toll and there was no way anyone could see this coming on someone so young.</p>
<p>Andrew has been living with his dad while getting worse and worse. Today, November 2nd, Andrew was readmitted to the hospital in Santa Fe. He has to remain on an IV as his body is completely rejecting food. The cancer in his Liver cobvers over 60% of his Liver. The doctors believe that with VERY agressive treatment they can give him a long life, however they must start now. We are not sure how long Andrew will remain in the hospital this time. The hospital is 2 hours from his home, which means more hotel rooms. His mom, siter and one of his brothers live in Florida, which means more plane flights, more hotels, more rental cars and more time off work. No one could plan for that. I am his oldest brother, I live in Dallas and have not been able to get out to see him yet. </p>
<p>Andrew is a fighter. His family is heartbroken. He has no insurance, no job, no home. He needs our help. A dollar will help.</p>
<p>The state of New Mexico is helping, the drug companies are helping. We are not fighting this completely alone, but there is more that is needed.</p>

<h3>    My Name is Thomas Meyer, my daughter Ashley was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma in July 2012. </h3>
<p>    At the time of the scans the scans revealed many tumors throughout her torso,  1 was 14cm long by 5 cm wide.  She actually had more cancer than body at that point.  Her insurance has a large deductable/out of pocket expense that we are tryting to help her raise as well as other expenses related to her struggle.  Ashley is currently enrolled in the University of Wisconsin Whitewater where she is studying business and management, I want her to focus on her education and getting well throughout this period in her life.</p>
<h3>     Breakdown of needs</h3>
<p>    The funds we are requesting (10,000+) will go mostly towards he mounting medical expenses that insurance considers ""Not Covered"".  Other expenses would include gasoline/routine maintence of her vehicle for the numorous doctor visits, as many as 4-5 visits a day not all in the same location.  Overall she travels as much as 75-125 miles a day depending on what treatment she requires for that particular day.  We currently have a trust set up for her, so all funds go directly to that for proper dispursement.</p>
<p>    As we all know education is highly important to success in life, by taking the financial burden off her shoulders it frees her up to concentrate on her education, her long road to a full cancer free recovery and overall free state of mind/well being.</p>
<p>    All funds will go directly to Ashley's trust account and if we do not reach our goal any monies raised will go to the most needed areas of her expenses. </p>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>     We did have an amazing fund raiser for her in late October 2012 and managed to raise enough money for most of her medical expenses.  However that starts all over as of January 2013 as her ""calander year"" starts over then.</p>
<p>     Seeing her expression as we had the overwhelming support of our community, friends and family was worth more than any money we raised because it was the first time since this all started that Ashley realized she was not alone through any of her strugles.  As a father it also humbled me to fell the supoport and generosity of people even in trying times like the ones we all experience in our own lives. </p>

<h3>Why This Campaign?</h3>
<p>Hey everyone! My name is Lauren Beller, and I live in Philadelphia. I went to Temple (GO OWLS!), and I have a degree in Elementary and Special Education. I am an activist, advocate, musician, movie-lover, and an overall good person.  I also happen to use a power wheelchair, and my current one is about to die.  My wheelchair is cool, but it costs a lot of money initially and also to maintain, but it also allows me to live my life mostly independently. I have a lot to offer this world despite my disability, and  my wheelchair is the main tool that allows me to be a part of society.<br/></p>
<p>My current wheelchair is on its way out, which means that I am at risk of getting stranded in my home, or worse, it could stop working when I'm out in public.  My chair has several seating components that let me change the position I am sitting in, which decreases my chronic pain, but the motors for these systems are just about shot.  Long story short, I need a new chair.  The process has already begun, and my insurance company has covered the chair, but only about a third of the cost.  In order to get the chair, I owe <b>$17,823.83 </b>out of pocket.  This cost covers the portion of the chair that the insurance covered, but also the parts that were denied coverage. As you can see, I'm kind of stuck.</p>
<p>Can you please help? Every penny helps me.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>Here's the breakdown: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Total for the chair (including parts that were covered and denied): $26,511.53</li>
<li>Amount covered by insurance: $8,687.70 </li>
<li>Denied items: $4,007.00</li>
<li>Total amount I owe: <b>$17,823.83</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I cannot offer much in the perks department, but please know that your generous contribution, however large or small, means so much to me. Any contribution you make will go directly to making me feel fully human by diminishing my chronic pain and by increasing my level of personal independence.</p>
<p>Any additional funds over my goal will be set aside for use to maintain the wheelchair or for other denied medical costs. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This new wheelchair will drastically impact the value of my life by doing the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Most obviously, it will allow me to navigate the world. The model of chair that I ordered is designed to navigate bumps while still maintaining its stability. It has several features that are designed to support someone of my weight that my current wheelchair does not have. </li>
<li>I was born with a condition called Arthrogryposis, and it affects my joints, muscles, and ligaments. I have muscle weakness, stiffness, and a lot of pain. This wheelchair has elevating leg rests, the ability to tilt in space, can recline to a laying position, and has a seat elevator that allows me to increase my seated height by eight inches. The components that allow me to change my seating position are the difference between a life of pain and one where my pain is manageable. The seat elevator will help to compensate for my weaker muscles by allowing me additional access to higher items that would otherwise be out of my reach, or too heavy to lift from that height. </li>
<li>I live in the city, and my social life is also enhanced by my wheelchair. People who don't use chairs often take for granted the privilege of being able to look a peer in the eyes. The seat elevator will allow me to do that as well. Another way my social life will be enhanced is through the longer battery life that the new chair has. </li>
<li>This chair also has some safety features that are really important. It has a lights package on it, which will make it safer for me to navigate the city at night. This is something I have to do regularly, and safety has always been a concern. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I really appreciate you taking the time to read my story, and if you are in a position to contribute, I will be ever grateful. If you can't though, you can still help. Please share this link through your networks and use the Indiegogo sharing tools. </p>
<p>Please help me fund this wheelchair so my disability can't hold me back. </p></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Why This Campaign?

<p>I’m Ryan C. Greene, CEO of
GreeneHouse Media, Best Selling Author and National Radio Talk Show Host, but
the one title that means the most to me is “DAD”! As a father of two young
children it pains me to watch so many children literally having their lives
stripped away from them by obesity! Whether it’s because of poor diet, lack of
any form of exercise or misinformation, the trend of overweight kids in America
must be bucked. The burden was laid on my heart to be an active warrior in the
fight against childhood obesity and to help more kids find healthy lifestyle
alternatives to what they’re currently being taught. I’ve incorporated the help
of my own two children and we are setting out to revolutionize children’s
health and fight childhood obesity one kid at a time!</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Childhood
Obesity is an EPIDEMIC in America.</b> The Center for Disease Control and
Prevention’s states:</span><br/></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Childhood obesity has more
than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The percentage of children
aged 6–11 years in the United States who were obese increased from 7% in 1980
to nearly 18% in 2010. Similarly, the percentage of adolescents aged 12–19
years who were obese increased from 5% to 18% over the same period.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>In 2010, more than one
third of children and adolescents were overweight or obese.</p>
<p>Childhood obesity has both immediate and long term effects on health and well being. Some immediate health effects include: risk factors for cardiovascular
disease such as high cholesterol and high blood pressure, pre-diabetes and
greater risk for bone and joint problems, sleep apnea and social and
psychological problems such as stigmatization and poor self-esteem. Long term health effects include: likelihood to
be obese as adultsand are
therefore more at risk for adult health problems such as heart disease, type 2
diabetes, stroke, several types of cancer, and osteoarthritis.</p>

<h1>WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT</h1>
<p>America is overweight. That’s
just the bottom line. We can no longer watch our kids eat themselves to a slow
death without giving them a fighting chance at health. Instead of teaching them
how to be unhealthy and obese while they’re young, then expecting them to spend
their entire adult lives fighting the bulge, why not teach them early better
eating and fitness habits? This video isn’t about making kids skinny, but it’s
about teaching them healthy alternatives for a more fulfilling life in a fun
exciting way. Schools have removed Physical Education. Video games have
replaced outdoor games like Freeze Tag. Kids are more sedentary now than ever. </p>
<p>There’s never been a fitness
program targeted to youth done BY youth and KIDsanity! is changing that. The
fun easy to do workout routines and the entertaining skits will work in tandem
to increase kid’s awareness of how to take control of their health at an early
age. The parents will also learn from a Pediatrician and Clinical Psychologist
how they can make a more physically and mentally healthy home for their
children. Until this point, fitness has been left up to people to figure out
once they become adults and then they’re left buying every workout DVD or piece
of exercise equipment they see advertised in an effort to reverse the decades
of abuse they’ve done to their bodies. KIDsanity! is the preventative measure
that will teach kids early what most of us wish someone would have taught us. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>SO WHAT IF YOU CAN’T CONTRIBUTE FINANCIALLY?</h1>
<p>While it would be perfect if
everyone could donate at least $10, the reality is you just may not be in a
position to donate at all. But you still can help! If you don’t have money, you
definitely have a network, a group of friends, a circle of influence,
something! If you see the value in this project then spread the word! Tell
others about it and encourage them to donate. 
Share this link with everyone you know and let’s get the donations
flowing so that KIDsanity! can become a reality. Indiegogo has built in tools
right on this page which make sharing this campaign a cinch! Simply click all
of the links and share with entire social network. Time is of the essence. We
want to release this DVD in time for Christmas so don’t delay. Donate and
spread the word to your friends! </p>

GreeneHouse Media, Best Selling Author and National Radio Talk Show Host, but
the one title that means the most to me is “DAD”! As a father of two young
children it pains me to watch so many children literally having their lives
stripped away from them by obesity! Whether it’s because of poor diet, lack of
any form of exercise or misinformation, the trend of overweight kids in America
must be bucked. The burden was laid on my heart to be an active warrior in the
fight against childhood obesity and to help more kids find healthy lifestyle
alternatives to what they’re currently being taught. I’ve incorporated the help
of my own two children and we are setting out to revolutionize children’s
health and fight childhood obesity one kid at a time!

THE PROBLEM

Childhood
Obesity is an EPIDEMIC in America. The Center for Disease Control and
Prevention’s states:
· 
Childhood obesity has more
than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years.
· 
The percentage of children
aged 6–11 years in the United States who were obese increased from 7% in 1980
to nearly 18% in 2010. Similarly, the percentage of adolescents aged 12–19
years who were obese increased from 5% to 18% over the same period.
· 
In 2010, more than one
third of children and adolescents were overweight or obese.
Childhood obesity has both immediate and long term effects on health and well being. Some immediate health effects include: risk factors for cardiovascular
disease such as high cholesterol and high blood pressure, pre-diabetes and
greater risk for bone and joint problems, sleep apnea and social and
psychological problems such as stigmatization and poor self-esteem. Long term health effects include: likelihood to
be obese as adultsand are
therefore more at risk for adult health problems such as heart disease, type 2
diabetes, stroke, several types of cancer, and osteoarthritis.

WHAT WE’RE GONNA DO ABOUT IT
’s Coach
Greene’s KIDsanity!: In-Home Fitness Training System will only be the
BIGGEST, MOST EXCITING, MOST ENTERTAINING, MOST INNOVATIVE solution to fight
against childhood obesity this side of EVER!  A multi-disc DVD training system designed FOR
KIDS and LED BY KIDS; KIDsanity! is not about getting
skinny or becoming muscular, but this DVD system promotes physical fitness,
healthy eating and healthy living for kids in a fun exciting way. Kids who
embark on this 60-day fitness plan will get fit, learn better eating habits,
become more physically and mentally healthy and successfully combat childhood
obesity.
Your contribution to this
campaign will make the filming and release of Coach Greene’s KIDsanity! possible
thereby helping to combat childhood obesity and develop a healthier generation
of youth. Your donation to make Coach Greene’s KIDsanity! a reality will
literally SAVE CHILDREN from a lifetime of health, mental and financial
problems relating to obesity.

<p>In addition, we focus on alleviating the pain or trying to strengthen the area that hurts, without seeing the big picture and fully addressing the root cause.  The resulting uphill battle has led most people to believe that so-called ""normal"" wear and tear is unavoidable and permanent, instead of something that's completely preventable and correctable!</p><p>(For example, did you know that cartilage regenerates?  It's just a matter of whether your <b>habits</b> wear it down faster than it can grow back!)</p>

<p>I’ve completed a detailed outline for ""The Human Body User Manual: Physical Health"" (updated estimate of around 300 pages), which is the first in its series (subsequent volumes will deal similarly with nutrition and mental health).  This book will teach people how the body
actually works as a biological machine, in order to detect, prevent, and
correct the majority of biomechanical dysfunction.</p><p>What can it solve?  Well, for example, in my case I've already:</p><ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">corrected flat feet</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">eliminated foot, knee, and hip pain</span><br/>

<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">restored range of motion in the ankle (that I didn't know I had lost)</span><br/>

Got aches and pains?  Or are you ahead of the game and looking to prevent their onset?  Either way, you've come to the right place!Welcome to the first book that thoroughly explains how the body develops, how it changes structure over time, and why it wears down – not primarily because of aging or genetics, but because of the movement habits we learn as we're growing up in (or adapting to) our modern environment – and, most importantly, how to fix it when things go wrong!We don't just need to move more as a society, we need to move better.  We promote regeneration or degeneration in our muscles and joints every single day based on our unconscious movement habits, and the only way to combat and reverse the effects of bad habits is to learn better ones.Unfortunately, this information is not yet coming from our medical professionals.  For starters, the effects of poor movement patterns often build up for years or decades before symptoms develop. But doctors, especially when constrained by our ""medically necessary"" insurance restrictions, rarely address these issues until AFTER patients are already in pain!
In addition, we focus on alleviating the pain or trying to strengthen the area that hurts, without seeing the big picture and fully addressing the root cause.  The resulting uphill battle has led most people to believe that so-called ""normal"" wear and tear is unavoidable and permanent, instead of something that's completely preventable and correctable!(For example, did you know that cartilage regenerates?  It's just a matter of whether your habits wear it down faster than it can grow back!)
I want to bring this information to the public – teaching people how to understand their bodies and what to do to take care of them – in a highly illustrated and professionally polished format that will really open eyes and begin to change the way we practice medicine.
The Human Body User Manual
I’ve completed a detailed outline for ""The Human Body User Manual: Physical Health"" (updated estimate of around 300 pages), which is the first in its series (subsequent volumes will deal similarly with nutrition and mental health).  This book will teach people how the body
actually works as a biological machine, in order to detect, prevent, and
correct the majority of biomechanical dysfunction.What can it solve?  Well, for example, in my case I've already:
corrected flat feet

eliminated foot, knee, and hip pain


restored range of motion in the ankle (that I didn't know I had lost)

regained the ability to stand on one leg at a time (essential to many daily actions)
gotten half an inch taller in the last year
increased my leg press strength by 90 pounds in 11 days

finally found the meaning of ""engaging the core""

and even reduced ingrown toenails by changing how I walk and stand!

Appendix A: Bare Feet in the Modern WorldAppendix B: Case StudiesReferencesGlossaryIndexAbout the AuthorTo get an even more detailed summary of the topics covered in this manual, take a look at my chapter-by-chapter overview.
Since this is my first book and it’s so important, I'm
starting off by working with a professional writing coach.  I
plan to use an independent publisher and release it first as an e-book this spring (the biggest time factor is how

Budgeting for QualityI know people need this as soon as possible, and I want to get a first edition of it out this spring.  But on my own, I can't afford to develop it to the standard I would like to without it taking much, much longer than that!To put it together, I've been working with a couple of

With less than the minimum goal, I will continue to forge ahead, but it will take a lot longer.  If we reach beyond my max goal, more choices open up, and I'll take a vote to see which direction you would most like me to go next (such as expanding content, offering print copy versions, or getting straight to work on the next volume in the series)!Moving

Like I said, my husband, son and I are from Serbia. This is small country in Europe. Serbia was in the 90's in a civil war, and in 1999. Serbia was bombed. We still suffer from this time, and we are living in poverty, the state is in chaos and therefore our health care, too.</p>
<p>My husband and I have become parents to our son Sergej in 2008. We were so happy. But after few months our problems have started.  We noticed that our Sergej late in psycho-motor development and he had a drooping eyelids.  It was not noticed by his pediatrician, what is big mistake in her work. Then we started wandering around from one doctor to another (physiatrists, neurologists, pediatricians, geneticists, oncologists, etc.). Over the next three years we went to physical therapy, MRI, scanner, various analyzes, etc. We stayed in hospital a lot, trying to find out what is with my son. Unfortunately all the doctors who saw Sergej did not know what to tell us. They did not know will Sergej ever walk and no one did know what to say about his eyelids. They just said that it is commonly to do a routine operation ptosis after the third year. Now I know it is not routine operation at all. So, after all this physical therapy (when Sergej was 2,5 years old) Sergej started to walk alone. This happiness I will never forget. But, we still don’t know what is wrong with him? MRI, scanner, all analyses …. everything is ok. So, what is wrong with our son? Then we have found another doctor (neurologist) and went to see him. This is the first doctor who said “we need to find out the real reason of his problems”. Finally some doctor said it. He sent us to see genetics doctor. Then we went to genetic doctor. He thinks Sergej has a postaxial polydactyly (There is something like wart on his left hand, and on his right there is something like pimple. On that basis the doctor thinks it's a  postaxial polydactyly). The association of ptosis and polydactyly with developmental delays clearly indicates a genetic disease / syndrome. This combination did not remind him of anomalies in any of the more common disformic syndrome, but searching through base of genetic diseases can be found a total of 20 entities which occur within the ptosis and polydactyly. To find the right diagnosis we have to do some analyses, but we can not do not even one of them in Serbia. In the meantime, we had to go to Slovenia to do surgery of ptosis. Why in Slovenia? Because even this can not be done right in Serbia. After first surgery we went one more time for another surgery, and we will go in three years again. So, this is not routine operation at all. Sergej is progressing nicely and it seems like that everything will be ok, but we can not be sure because we do not have a diagnosis, and it’s hard to think about expanding the family (what we want) because we do not know what is the risk that something like this happens again. I had to start asking geneticists around the world, because we already did everything that could done in Serbia, and now we are left to ourselves. Now I am in contact with some doctor from London. The doctor is interested in our case (because it is really specific and hard to figure out the diagnosis) and suggests some analysis and examinations. For this we need to go to London. For first examination in London we need 350£, for each additional 250£, for CGH analysis 550£, for metabolic analysis 2000£, for fragile X analysis 300£, for skeletal survey 932£, and of course we need to pay costs of travel and a week stay in London. That amount of money is huge for us, taking in account that we spent all of our money in therapies we had to do (it cost us a lot, because we had to do almost everything in private clinics). And even for this we had to ask some companies for help. Now I don’t know where to find money for those analyses. Some friend from America told me for this site. Now I want to try to collect money here.</p>
<p>What can I possibly offer to those who are able to help us? My promise that we will do everything for my son to be healthy and a good man. Sergej is a wonderful child, cheerful, smiling, sensitive, ... Every person who has a child knows how much it means when child is healthy. People in Serbia live very hard, with average salaries of 300€. Much more painful is when next to everyday problems that people have in Serbia, one have a sick child and not knowing what is with him.  Everything that we have done (my husband and I) was not simple, as anything in Serbia isn’t. We are trying to find the answer to the question<strong> what is with Sergej</strong>. This is important to know for eventually another child that we are planning, to be aware of the risk that something like this could happen again.</p>
<p> Our story came out in the pages on the internet by a daily newspaper last year after first surgery in Slovnia. Here is the link (but all is on Serbian).</p>

What can I possibly offer to those who are able to help us? My promise that we will do everything for my son to be healthy and a good man. Sergej is a wonderful child, cheerful, smiling, sensitive, ... Every person who has a child knows how much it means when child is healthy. People in Serbia live very hard, with average salaries of 300€. Much more painful is when next to everyday problems that people have in Serbia, one have a sick child and not knowing what is with him.  Everything that we have done (my husband and I) was not simple, as anything in Serbia isn’t. We are trying to find the answer to the question what is with Sergej. This is important to know for eventually another child that we are planning, to be aware of the risk that something like this could happen again.
 Our story came out in the pages on the internet by a daily newspaper last year after first surgery in Slovnia. Here is the link (but all is on Serbian).

I wrote by simply words because I speak English poorly
I ask all good people to help me. Then i can help my son and my family for good, healthy and heppy life.
Than you so much for your time.

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How is the program health promoting? </b></p>
<p>Chi Universe offers children a great cardiovascular workout while burning calories and improving flexibility, balance, coordination, strength, and stamina. By combining physical movements with breathing techniques, the program activates the parasympathetic nervous system lowering blood pressure, levels of stress hormone, and inflammation (which is implicated in diabetes, obesity, heart disease), inducing calm and focused learning. The twisting poses improve posture and help prevent scoliosis! The Chi Phresh Mat is a symmetrical design based on the principles of alignment, and aids these three functions; strong musculoskeletal foundation, proprioception, and cross neural development.</p>
<b>How does the program instill transferable skills, habits, and attitudes?</b><p></p>
<p>Kids feel happier and more confident!</p>
<p>Concentration on breath gives the child time to process information and emotion. Kids learn postures/moves as tools for life, to assist in regulating mood and tuning in. Self aware, deep thinking, and mindful, this generation will shift humanity!</p>

<br/><h3>About the Creator &amp; the Phresh Yoga Mat Invention</h3>
<p>I'm Bobbi Hamilton, a Certified Yoga Teacher, and lifelong devotee of Yoga. I believe in the healing effects of yoga for physical, mental, and emotional health. My love of movement began as a child athlete, and I’ve had extraordinary opportunities in working with Olympic diving coaches, and world-renowned Yoga, dance, and martial arts teachers. In college, I competed as a springboard and platform diver, and discovered that yoga alleviated my back pain and other accumulated sports injuries, as well as helped to calm my nervous system and focused my mind on schoolwork. I graduated from UC Berkeley, and while working in cancer research for UCSF/Mt. Zion, I became aware of the childhood obesity epidemic. Realizing the deep impact obesity and diabetes had on the future generation of kids, as well as the healthcare and economic systems, I turned my focus, attention and career towards creating prevention and reversal solutions for childhood obesity.</p>

<p>From lab research to field research, I began teaching Kids' Yoga and Fitness classes, and creating play-along videos to get kids active. My first videos, Animal Yoga Breaks, aired on PBS Kids stations in cities across the US which reached an estimated 20 million households in 2003-2008.</p>
<p>I accidentally invented the Chi Phresh Mat while teaching children’s yoga classes at the Venice Public Library. I began drawing on a mat to help a child get into the proper positions to prevent her from injuring herself. After <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">thousands of hours of product development and play-testing, I believe whole heartedly in the positive effects of the Chi Phresh Mat! I've seen it transform families!</span></p>My inner Berkeley activist is more passionate and determined than ever to get Chi Phresh Yoga Mats to children, families, and schools to create a healthier and more peaceful society. If you believe in Yoga, support children’s health, and want to contribute peace and non-violence to our schools, homes, and Earth, please purchase Chi Phresh Mats here as a gift for your child, teen, self, school, or studio.

The Movement
Take the Yoga Challenge for Children's Health Awareness!!
Check out our Yoga Challenge happening on instagram @chiuniverseyoga!
The Chi Phresh Mat and program has been play-tested in P.E., afterschool programs, studios and homes. It has also travelled to public and private schools, YogaWorks, Girl Scouts, Equinox Gym, Star Afterschool, Venice Basketball League, and 8 countries! Chi Activating kids & families across the US and around the Globe!

THE IMPACT
This is the first generation in history with a lower life expectancy than their parents. We must act now for children's health! 
We've developed a prevention and reversal solution for childhood obesity! 
Overweight kids regain motivation, self-esteem, and a connection to healthy habits. The easy-to-follow visual cues are also beneficial for teaching children with developmental delay. Kids with disabilities gain more function in limbs. The mat and  program has been offered as Movement Therapy for kids within the Autism Spectrum. Autistic students find the symbols “concrete” objects to focus on.

The Yoga Game
The Chi Phresh Mat comes to life when used in conjunction with the Chi Flow & Phreeze Yoga Game. The Yoga Game can be found on the  ""How-to"" Poster (included with every mat), the Chi Flow & Phreeze App, Videos, and/or Card Deck. It's a comprehensive and easy to learn system!


The Chi Flow & Phreeze Yoga Game!  It's a combination of Flow Yoga & Breakdance Phreezes. Pictures, symbols, and instructions guide you through 10 Levels. Style your pose. Add a peace sign!

The funds from the Pre-Sale will go into mass manufacturing to keep the momentum going...  We are launching this indiegogo campaign as a way to offer at a discount the Phresh Mat and Game, and newly offered Video and Card Game Deck... and yes it will make the perfect holiday gift!

Teachers... Check out our Chi Universe Teacher Training Manual: 
The teacher's training manual makes it easy for schoolteachers, Yoga teachers, gym teachers, therapists, after-school leaders, and moms to implement the program. The Chi Phresh Mat is a teaching tool and also provides a fun way for teachers to incorporate their own curricula and sequences of poses. 

The Chi Flow & Phreeze Curriculum is presented in a fun game format that makes it easy to get kids of all abilities and ages physically active! The Training Manual outlines a 12 week curriculum with 10 Levels and  108 poses, introducing exercises - flow yoga, breakdance 'phreezes,' (urban dance moves,) core strengtheners, and martial arts—all combined with breathing techniques that calm the nervous system and enhance focused learning. 
We already have teachers successfully integrating the Chi Universe program in LA, NY, SF, Chicago, Scottsdale, Amsterdam, London, Johannesburg, Malta, and the Four Seasons Resorts in Asia. 

Why do kids find this program fun and engaging? 
The Chi Phresh Mat is a personal game board and playground that keeps the child involved and focused. Kids report feeling good even after 1 or 2 poses! 
The Chi Flow & Phreeze Game cleverly disguises physical education with a “cool” creative cultural element the “phresh phreeze” which requires styling a pose to make it flashy - like adding a peace sign. We've created a fun Phresh Phreeze campaign concept to get kids active and participating around the world!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Miriam Gaudelli, I have been a massage therapist since 2005.  Back in 2015, I suffered from a concussion and I just wasn't getting better with the standardized concussion treatments.  I understood how frustrating it can be when you want to get better, but you seem to be stuck in a rut.  It was through the help of specialized individuals that I got better.</p>
<p>I am raising funds so that rehabilitation can be easier and more effective for my clients.  When someone has a concussion, they suffer from memory loss, fatigue, mood swings and changes in energy levels, it isn't the time for them to be going from clinic to clinic so they can get the rehabilitation they need.  With this campaign, I would like to bring various technologies in house so they only need to take appointments at ONE clinic and have ONE file that can be easily discussed with parents, doctors and coaching staff.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With this campaign, I would like to make concussion rehabilitation more accessible and easier to follow. I would like to raise 20 000$ Canadian (17000$ USD) so that I can:</p>
<p>- purchase the saccadic eye testing technology</p>
<p>- exercise equipement for concussions</p>
<p>- bike ergometer for exercise testing and rehabilitation</p>
<p>- more comfortable and adjustable treatment tables</p>
<p>- translation of the concussion information currently available in english</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Because of my experience as someone who suffered concussions and someone who has helped many rehabilitate their concussions, I have seen what an impact a concussion can have.  I've met people who dropped out of school, had to stop working, couldn't concentrate and some who suffer from permanent depression.  My personal anxiety stems from the concussions I suffered.  Luckily through the rehabilitation that I did and my art work, I am able to keep my anxiety at bay most of the time.  I would like to help others in similar situations.</p>
<p>Many methods of evaluating or tracking concussion rehabilitation are subjective and can easily be swayed, the technology I will be bringing in will give me concrete reports on the areas that need more work so we can be more effective.  </p>
<p>I've run a series of case studies with the work I have already done and hope to one day publish these case studies.  I hope to one day also contribute to concussion rehabilitation research through work that I do in my clinic.  This is a subject that I am very passionate about and hope to make a difference in people's lives. </p>
<p>I've been reading many books on the lives of ex-professional sports players and all I can ask myself, is ""how can I help my clients so they never go through this?""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The equipment I need is quite costly and my biggest fear is that I won't be able to pay for it all at once.  I have spoken to the company and they are able to make payment plans but would prefer not to.  Having the machine fully paid and functional from day one is the best scenario.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I had a business that failed, and it taught me a lot.  I have learned about innovative marketing tactics, financial survival and interesting business development strategies.  I wrote a manual on some of the things I learned that can be purchased through the crowd funding.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, or don't feel passionate about this subject, I get it!  Please help me by sharing it with your friends, family and anyone you know who might be interested.  Any help you can give me is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I´m Alex, and I wish to give something back to my best friend (34):

Since she was a child, 6 years old, she had health problems, with ignitions and damaged teeth. Until today there was only temporary relief. I want to get the financial resources for
artificial teeth,  these are not payed by national health services. So that the pain and restrictions, she has with her every-day
life, come to an end. <br/><br/><h2>Situation today</h2>Her gingival is ignited, and as the lower back teeth
and one eyetooth are missing, she is chewing on the gingival and it went so far, that, caused by that, there is also a scarved hole from the inside of her left cheek to the outside. This kind of pain I want to spare her in future. It´s getting worse, she barely has the energy at the
moment for her normal living. If we wait much longer, she will need a full
denture for the lower jaw. <br/><br/>The effect to her job<br/>As a voice over artist she

or proper implants.</b> I am worried that we cannot break the circle she´s getting in. Due to her whole health situation her monthly income is almost over the bread line, that´s too low to face anything.<br/><br/><h2>The solution is the goal<br/>

<h2><b>Über uns</b></h2>
<p>Ich bin Alex. Ich möchte ein Lachen schenken und
meiner besten Freundin (34) damit etwas zurückgeben. Sie stand mir in meiner
schwersten Zeit immer beiseite und führte mich sozusagen ins Leben zurück. Ohne
sie wäre ich nicht da, wo ich heute bin. Ich bin über den Berg, jetzt ist es an
der Zeit für mich, Danke zu sagen.</p>
<h2><b>Worum es geht</b></h2>
<p>Es geht nicht einfach nur um ihr Lächeln, es ist
viel mehr als das. Sprache ist ihre Berufung, sie arbeitet als Sprecherin.
Durch ihre gesundheitliche Situation, kann sie nicht jeder Arbeit nachgehen und durch die Probleme mit dem Gebiss ist sie in ihrer möglichen Arbeit mehr als eingeschränkt. Mit 6 Jahren fingen
die gesundheitlichen Probleme an, zum Beispiel mit den Nebennieren,
Entzündungen und zerstörten Zähnen. Bisher gab es immer nur kurzweilige
Linderung. Ich möchte die finanziellen Mittel zusammenbringen, um ihr einen adäquaten
Zahnersatz zu ermöglichen, den sie braucht, damit ihre Schmerzen und
Beeinträchtigungen endlich ein Ende haben. Dieser wird leider nicht von den
Krankenkassen übernommen.</p>
<h2><b>Die Situation heute</b></h2>
<p>Ihr Zahnfleisch entzündet sich immer wieder, sie muss
auf dem Zahnfleisch kauen weil ihr die unteren Backenzähne und ein Eckzahn fehlen. Das
führte bereits soweit, dass sich ein vernarbtes Loch von der Innenseite der
linken Backe nach außen hin gebildet hat. Solche Schmerzen möchte ich ihr für die
Zukunft ersparen. Es wird immer schlimmer, es ist ihr mittlerweile kaum noch möglich,
die Energie aufzubringen, die sie für ihren Alltag braucht. Wenn noch länger
gewartet wird, braucht sie eine Vollprothese für den Unterkiefer.</p>
<h2><b>Auswirkungen auf den Job</b></h2>
<p>Als Sprecherin braucht sie die Implantate auch, da ohne
sie Nebengeräusche entstehen, die auf Aufnahmen zu hören sind. Auch herkömmliche
Prothesen machen es nicht besser und erzeugen ebenfalls Störgeräusche. <b>Die Lösung ist ordentlicher Zahnersatz - Brücken oder Implantate. </b>Auch damit
sie endlich aus dem Teufelskreis herauskommt. Durch die gesundheitlichen Probleme lebt sie knapp
über dem Existenzminimum. Das ist zu wenig um selbst etwas ändern zu können.</p>
<h2><b>Die Lösung ist das Ziel</b></h2>
<p>Warum warten, bis es zu spät ist? Lasst uns jetzt
helfen!</p>
<p>- Die Entzündungen müssen von einem Zahnarzt behandelt werden.</p>
<p>- Sie braucht professionelle Brücken (oder Implantate), diese werden nicht von der Krankenkasse übernommen.</p>
<p>Nach der Operation wird sie das professionelle
Sprechen erneut trainieren müssen, das liegt dann bei ihr.</p>
<p>Ich will sie mit dieser Idee überraschen, falls die
Spendenaktion erfolgreich wird und ihr damit helfen, ein Leben zu führen, das
wieder lebenswerter ist. Dafür sind Freunde da. Um für einen freien Kopf zu
sorgen. Ich möchte, dass ihr wieder professionelle Aufnahmen möglich sind,
damit ihr Auskommen gesichert ist und sie grundsätzlich auf den Beinen bleibt.</p>
<p>Unser familiäres und freundschaftliches Umfeld ist
nicht in der Lage, ihr finanziell zu helfen. Vielleicht schaffe ich es auf
diesem Weg, mich bei ihr angemessen zu bedanken. </p>

<i>Strawberry Moon</i> is Seattle's definitive source for raw, cold-pressed juice. We strive to find a balance between the utilitarian need for nutrition, and the epicurean desire for flavor and nuance. In order to make a daily juice habit as palatable as possible, we craft over 20 different flavors, or ""remedies"" of green juices, root vegetable juices, citrus juices, and nut mylks. If you are familiar with our brand already, you know that it is an incredibly eclectic array of potions and panaceas. <br/>

<div>Our juice:</div>
<div>- is non-gmo</div>
<div>- uses locally sourced produce whenever possible</div>
<div>- uses organic produce whenever possible</div>
<div>- is never high pressure processed (HPP is a non-thermal pasteurization process that lengthens shelf life, but damages the integrity of the enzymes, nutrients, minerals, and probiotics that would otherwise be present in truly raw juice. Because we do not HPP our juice, it is truly fresh, which means it expires within four days.)</div>

</div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<div></div>
<p>We have been cold-pressing juice for nearly five years. A few months ago, in hopes of conjuring up our very own retail space, we were led to a location in Queen Anne that we were told was already permitted as a “cafe"". Eagerly, we dove right in. What we’ve found out since contradicts that information, and now, after sinking a great deal of time and resources into the space, we have discovered that we ourselves are responsible to fully permit the location. Furthermore, if the original space (before we moved in) was never built to code, the cost of repairs may prove unfeasible. We are struggling to secure the final, long term permits that would allow us to sell our juice from our Queen Anne location<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. We already have a handful of permits hanging on the wall, but as of now, it seems we need some more. </span></p>
<p>So, with $15,000:</p>
<p>- we will obtain a full plumbing inspection and permitting of the space.</p>
<p>-if full permitting is feasible, we will complete all finishing touches in the store that are needed (rearrange sinks, insert grease trap, inspect and finalize plumbing and electricity) </p>
<p>- we will complete the permitting process in full</p>
<p>- if the plumbing and electrical permits prove too costly, we would seek to establish a foundation at various Farmers Markets, while securing a refrigerated juice truck to improve delivery and create a mobile juice program.</p>
<p>- any funds we raise in addition to our goal will go towards solving corporate greed, ISIS, and climate change.</p>
<p>Primarily however, this money will be used to determine the best means for us to make and sell fresh, healthy, raw juices and foods in the Emerald City, and beyond. While you can purchase non-fresh, HPP juice at almost any store in Seattle, finding truly raw juice in this town is not an easy thing to do. The red tape one must go through in order to press and sell fresh juice is a mine field of uncertainty. We are working closely with the city, and now the state, for the right to deliver health giving, delicious raw juice in the safest way allowed. So, if the space is eventually deemed unusable, we would redirect the funds towards avenues that would allow us to continue pressing fresh juice for the community, and the means for getting that juice to those who want it.</p>
<p> This is a fixed funding campaign. An all or nothing effort. We want to do this right, and the only way to do that is by reaching our goal in full. If we are unable to do that, the funds will not be collected, and we will all die consuming corporate food.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, I'm making this page for a great friend of mine Donald (TJ).</p>
<p>Anyone that knows TJ knows what an awesome person he is. He is always trying to help anyone he can when they are in need. He is a great friend, brother, son and god father to his 2 god children. He doesnt deserve for something this cruel to have happened to him and he can use all the help he can get right now.</p>
<p>Here is what happened:</p>
<p>On July 3rd he went with his family and one of his friends to a firework show in Jackson, CA. A group of drunk kids started picking on his family and starting attacking them. TJ tried so hard to get these kids to leave his family and friends alone. Finally one of the kids TJ asked to leave took his empty alcohol bottle and swung it at him slicing above his eyebrow and puncturing his eye. </p>
<p>So far, TJ has been through a 4.5 hour surgery with little hope of saving his eye, the Dr's said that if they can keep the eye alive (doubtful) he will probably never see out of it again. He will be going through more surgeries to try and keep the eye alive at least so they dont have to remove it. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are trying to gather some money for TJ to help pay some of his hospital bills and transportation prices to get to all his follow up appointments and surgeries.</p>
<p>He is unable to work his roofing job right now so I am hoping he can get enough money to help him pay rent and groceries until he can start working again. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know times are so hard financially to us all right now. Even 5$ would add up to greatly help TJ. </p>
<p>Even if your not able to contribute, if you know TJ PLEASE share this to everyone you know! We are trying to get this by as many loving, caring, understanding and willing to help people as we can.</p>

<p align=""left"">Annie Jones has been a proud mother and a life long leader in the Chicago land Community.  Ms. Jones was born in Mississippi, but spent her entire life in Chicago.  She raised all her kids as a single parent as well as siblings, non relatives throughout her life.  On May 12,2012, at the age of 71, she fell down an extensive amount of stairs which led to her current medical condition.  This experience has been devastating to say the least.  Despite this tragedy, Ms. Jones has suffered <span>a lot</span>.  Some Medicare services are not available to her through Public Aid due to not reporting accurate income as required in the early 1980's.  As a result she will not be eligible for ANY ASSISTANCE for the remainder of her life.  (NO FREE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE!!!!) </p>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Medical History Prior to May 12, 2012</strong></p>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<p align=""left"">Over the last 39 yrs Ms. Jones has battled the following medical conditions Diabetes, and High Blood Pressure.  She also had the following medical procedures:  1998 (Hip surgery from a car accident)  2002 ( 2 captional surgeries, right arm and left hand)  2005 (Heart valve replacement with a pacemaker)  2007 ( Thyroid surgery)  2009 (vertebrae surgery)  2010 (total left knee replacement)  and a few others. </p>

Diagnoses: Quadriplegia, Spinal Damage from a fall
 
Story
 
Annie Jones has been a proud mother and a life long leader in the Chicago land Community.  Ms. Jones was born in Mississippi, but spent her entire life in Chicago.  She raised all her kids as a single parent as well as siblings, non relatives throughout her life.  On May 12,2012, at the age of 71, she fell down an extensive amount of stairs which led to her current medical condition.  This experience has been devastating to say the least.  Despite this tragedy, Ms. Jones has suffered a lot.  Some Medicare services are not available to her through Public Aid due to not reporting accurate income as required in the early 1980's.  As a result she will not be eligible for ANY ASSISTANCE for the remainder of her life.  (NO FREE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE!!!!) 
 
 
Medical History Prior to May 12, 2012
 
Over the last 39 yrs Ms. Jones has battled the following medical conditions Diabetes, and High Blood Pressure.  She also had the following medical procedures:  1998 (Hip surgery from a car accident)  2002 ( 2 captional surgeries, right arm and left hand)  2005 (Heart valve replacement with a pacemaker)  2007 ( Thyroid surgery)  2009 (vertebrae surgery)  2010 (total left knee replacement)  and a few others. 
 
 
Family
 
Children
 
Two sons:  Harrison Jones, Harvey Jones
 
Four daughters:  Annette Jones, Audrey Jones, Vanessa Jones, Earlene Lovelace
 
Siblings:  Garrison Jones, Sherman Jones, Jeanette Jones
 
Ms Jones has a host of nieces, nephews, cousins, grandchildren, and great grandchildren.  She is the oldest of her siblings.  She's also the heart, soul, and backbone of the Jones family. 
 
In Loving Memory:  The following family members have gone on to be with the Lord:  Effie Jones (Mother)  Archie Elliot  (Father)   Juanita Brown-Jones (Daughter)  Harrison Jones Jr.,  Cornelius Jones  (Brothers)  Deborah Jones (Sister) 
 
 
 
Medical Expenses: 
 
 
Ms.  A. Jones has numerous collections totaling over $25,000 and counting in medical bills alone to date.  When applying for financial assistance, responses included:  ""2 co-signers needed"",  ""high credit score needed"".  Basically in order to get any kind of assistance, you have to be a middle class working person.  Even the loan companies require a ridiculous deposit with huge financing charges which are usually attached to a denial letter.
 
 
Mission:
 
Our mission is to raise a minimum of $25,000 to make her home handicap accessible.  These features will include the following:  front and rear stair lift, front and rear ramps, van with lift,  fitness equipment for rehab purposes.  She also needs funds for ongoing medical bills, medication, and medical supplies.
 
 
Promise:
 
100% OF ALL PROCEEDS WILL BE USED FOR THE MEDICAL EXPENSES AND REHABILITATION OF ANNIE JONES.
 
 
Plea:
 
 
Please circulate this cause to caring people.  No donation is too small.  All anonymous and open donations of any amount are a true blessing and are welcome.  If everyone gives a little then we all can help A WHOLE LOT. 
 
Prayers:
 
For the recovery of Annie Jones and that she is restored to a highly functional status very soon. 
 
Special Thanks:

<p>Hello and welcome to my fundraising campaign to raise money for medical supplies. I feel somewhat guilty for asking for money because I know there are other people who are in far worse condition than I am.</p>
<p>My name is Jaime. On June 10, 1987 my life changed forever due to an unfortunate gunshot wound I received when I was 14 years old. Long story short, another kid was playing with a loaded handgun and it accidentally discharged striking me in the neck which left me paralyzed.</p>
<p>Because of this I became a C4-C5 quadriplegic. This means my spinal cord was severed between the fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae. I have very limited arm movement and no wrist nor hand movement. I pretty much need 24 hour care which would include bathing, getting dressed, and feeding of which my parents have done for the last 25 years.</p>
<p>My passion is computers and technology. I am the guy who all of the neighbors brings their computer to when they need help. I love helping out where I can up to the limitations of my disability. I spend most of my time on social network websites which allows me some outlet to meet other people. I rarely leave my house other than to attend an occasional movie or go out to eat with close friends. My father and mother have  taken for the last 25 years and have kept me very comfortable and healthy. Without them I have no idea what I would do.</p>
<p>The reason why I need this money is specifically for what is called a hoyer lift. This is a mechanical lift that uses a sling and a lift that is used to get me in and out of the bed into my wheelchair. Today, my mother and father use what I call for a lack of a better term the potato sack method. Basically physically lifting me in and out of my bed into my wheelchair. My parents are getting to the age where it is very difficult if not impossible to lift me in that matter anymore. The lift would go a long ways to helping us out. The rest of the donation would go to other medical supplies such as a manual wheelchair and other miscellaneous supplies.</p>
<p>As you are well aware medical supplies are very expensive and my insurance company only allows $1000 per year for durable medical supplies. In reality this means that they will not pay for anything and most of the expenses that I occur for durable medical supplies has come out of my pocket. The over the ceiling hoyer lift itself cost around $5000 installed. I use a mouse stick to type and those are $70. A manual wheelchair cost around $3000 due to the customization it would need for my severe disability. I do not take any government assistance such as SSI.</p>
<p>I know there are other people who are far worse than I am however, if you feel this is a worthy cause feel free to donate. Once again I would like to thank you for considering my campaign and your pending donation. Every little bit of money sure would help me a lot.</p>
<p>By the way, the picture on the campaign shows my mom, my good friend Corey, and me. The reason why they have their hands on my chest like that is because we went to the taste of Colorado and I spilled curry chicken on my T-shirt. They are covering the stains with their hands. God love them.</p></div>","I want to be perfectly transparent. I didn't need that much money. Somehow I added 20,000 and could not change it later.

<p> </p>
<p>Firstly Thanks a lot to all and every each of you for looking at our campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Inga and I currently live in Bradford,UK. I have an older sister Agne who lives in London. We also have two little half-sisters Uma 5yrs and Era 3yrs. Our parents divorced years ago and our Dad Juozas age 58 re-married. They live in Calgary, AB, Canada. Our Mum lives in Lithuania.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are very close family and share everything together. Good things, bad things, sadness and happiness. When we were kids we used to spend all weekends together with family in nature. And now when we all around a world we speak to each other nearly every day. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My dad is respected sports person in Lithuania. He is very active, very friendly and clever person. He is loving and caring Dad. He is our mountain. He always supports us no matter what. He is our best friend.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the last few years our Dad was taking care of our little ""Tornadoes"". And spend all time with them. They lived in Canada before for a while, but then moved back to Lithuania after Uma got ill. She has a very bad asthma. They stayed in Lithuania for a while until Uma got better and, after realising that they have better opportunities in Canada, they packed their stuff and moved to Calgary in  August 2012.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everything was going quite good, but Dad started to feel worse and worse pains in his left side of body. Like rib pain, but it started to get so much worse, so Dad decided to see doctors. Oh, I forgot to mention that first he started to feel these pains around March 2012.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After millions of tests and scans, on the 10th of January 2013 our family was hit with horrible news. Our Dad was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. Which is bone marrow  cancer. Normal medication and chemotherapy won't cure the illness just slow it down. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was absolute shock to all of us. Our heads were full of questions... Why? Why him? What went wrong? He is healthy person, he doesn't smoke, he use alcohol only on special occasion, he eats loads of fruit and vegetable.. Why?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After few days of trying to understand what happened we decided that we have to return favour to our Dad and help him as much as we can. Days and nights me, Agne and me been living in internet, searching for solutions, advice, support. We found Dr Gonzalez in New York and at the time we thought it is very good place for him to go. It is very costly, but at this point we all understand that money is nothing to compare with life of our Dad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Me and Agne decided to send letter to some close friends to help us raise money for him to g to New York. As per today we received nearly $2000 from people that are close to us. Also, very good friend of our family contacted us with another solution rather then Dr.Gonzalez. He advised us that at this stage is the best place for him is to go to Hippocrates Health Institute (HHI). And stay here for few weeks. We spent few days discussing this solution and we decided that we want him to go there. There he can help himself. Treatment is expensive, but it's nothing compared to the value of his life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To do that we need to find help to support his wife with girls. So, we discussed it between us and we decided that the best option is for me to go there. It will let Dad relax and concentrate when knowing that his wife is not struggling and girls are looked after their sister.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So it looks like a plan.. We staying positive, Dad is waiting for me to come and let him go there, but we don't have enough funds. We need minimum $5000 for his treatment and tickets to Florida, and around $2000 for my trip and stay in Canada. Plus all other expenses. We already have $2000 from friends and I am already checking tickets for me and Dad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We decided to make this campaign because we have no other choice. We need money and we need it fast! We need to help our Dad as soon as we can and we need to make him stronger and healthier. So your help and support is so much appreciated! We want to do this for our Dad, without him worrying about money. We want him to go there and take care of himself. And we will do the rest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the moment he doesn't work. He looks after girls and is using an ant-cancer diet that has been recommended to him during his own research... He is a strong person and we all believe that with a bit of our help he will be fine. By 'our' I mean YOU, me and all people around us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So please, help us to help our Dad. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you have any questions, any advice please do not hesitate to contact me! I am here for that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From all of our family Thank You!! We can all turn his life around and help him be healthy and happy person again.</p>

<p>Ninja Cleaner is a Windows application that's designed to remove temporary files from your computer. The program searches your entire hard drive for potential space-wasters, including files used by commonly-used programs such as web browsers and media applications. The goal of the program is to be able to clean as much as possible as easily as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Ninja Cleaner - Screenshot 1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/944131_10151723421421554_1100357781_n.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Ninja Cleaner - Screenshot 1""/></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>What Sets Ninja Cleaner Apart?</h2>
<p>What makes Ninja Cleaner different from other temporary file removers? Ninja Cleaner aims to be user-friendly, as well as functional. It already contains options for cleaning web browers, along with several different temporary file types. To be developed are options to clean files left behind by specific programs (such as Dropbox, Spotify, and Adobe Reader), an ""At A Glance"" feature which shows how much space temporary files are using on your computer, and an option to quickly run the most basic cleaning job from your desktop. Also in the works are features which allow for media library organization and optimization. Also, God willing, Ninja Cleaner will come with support for plugins that third parties can write in order to extend its capabilities.</p>
<p>In addition to including features that other applications don't have, Ninja Cleaner uses open-source projects in its code base. As a result, the projects help Ninja Cleaner grow, and vice versa. Also, I am an independent developer who eventually wants to make a living from programming, either for myself or for other companies. Ninja Cleaner is written by one guy who simply wants to get his project out there.</p>
<h2><strong>Why I Need Money</strong></h2>
<p>While I've managed to work without much help and resources up to this point, I'm going to need both in order to make Ninja Cleaner a success. Here's a general idea of what I intend to use the money for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Windows Licenses.</strong> This should be pretty self-explanatory.</li>
<li>
<strong>Android Devices.</strong> I need Android tablets and/or phones in order to test the (hopefully) future Android version of Ninja Cleaner.</li>
<li>
<strong>Advertising.</strong> I would like Ninja Cleaner to have as much exposure as possible, and that requires advertising.</li>
<li>
<strong>Artwork.</strong> Advertising won't mean much if Ninja Cleaner doesn't have a proper mascot to represent it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Translations.</strong> I'd like Ninja Cleaner to be as accessible to as many people as possible, and this means that it should be available in as many languages as possible.</li>
<li>
<strong>Development Tools.</strong> I may have to buy another program or two to either add some details to this version of Ninja Cleaner, or to help me create other ones.</li>
<li>
<strong>Unexpected Costs.</strong> They crop up. Life throws curveballs.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Ninja Cleaner - Screenshot 2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/970297_10151723421941554_1228835595_n.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Ninja Cleaner - Screenshot 2""/></p>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>No matter what you donate, you're getting your own copy of Ninja Cleaner a month before it's officially released to the public (God willing, of course)! $5 is the recommended donation, but any donation is fair game to get a copy. Also, your name will land in the credits as a special thank you to you!</p>
<p>If you donate $10 or more, you'll get access to an early version of Ninja Cleaner, starting on June 21st! This early (alpha) version will be very limited; only two cleaning jobs will be enabled, and the custom cleaning job will only clean a few web browsers (Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) and temporary file types. This is mainly so that I can gather feedback and suggestions, as well as so you can see how in-depth I intend to go with Ninja Cleaner. Also, if you send me feedback during the alpha and beta periods, your name will be placed in the credits as a tester.</p>
<p>A donation of $15 or more will grant you access to every plugin to be made for Ninja Cleaner from now until the end of the program's life. Plugin support most likely won't be available until around the full release. If you're a C# or VB.NET developer (or any other .NET developer), $25 will grant you access to the plugin SDK so that you can make your own plugins. A release date for the SDK is to be determined, but that will most likely also be near the time of the full release, God willing. Also, you'll get an extra alpha access link to give to a friend!</p>
<p>$50 will grant you all of the above, as well as free copies of Ninja Cleaner for all other platforms it's written for. Also, you will get to help decide what platform it gets written for first!</p>
<p>Finally, a donation of $100 or more will allow you to download copies of any other program that I officially develop and release, regardless of how much I normally sell it for. You get access to everything!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Ninja Cleaner - Screenshot 3"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/931162_10151725552561554_951611105_n.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Ninja Cleaner - Screenshot 3""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What's Next?</strong></h2>
<p>As the fundraiser goes on, I plan on coding core features for Ninja Cleaner so that it can be as fully-functional as possible as quickly as possible. The beta is set to be released several months after the alpha, and the final release shouldn't be too far after that. I can't give any specific dates, but I would like to have the full release finished before either the end of this year or early next year. After the Ninja Cleaner beta or full release, I plan on beginning a new port for Ninja Cleaner for a different platform. What platform? I don't know yet. God willing, I guess I'll have to keep you posted.</p>
<p>Besides working on Ninja Cleaner, I have some browser extensions that should be worked on, along with a small app for mobile devices and the web. Other than that... who knows? So many ideas, so little time.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways to Help</strong></h2>
<p>If you're unable to donate, there are other ways you can help with Ninja Cleaner. Here's just a few of the ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Spread the Word.</strong> The more people that know about this fundraiser, the better.</li>
<li>
<strong>Translate.</strong> I would like Ninja Cleaner to be available in many languages. If you have a fluent understanding in another language, please get a hold of me! We can work something out!</li>
<li>
<strong>Code.</strong> I currently maintain two open-source projects on Codeplex, and they're both used in Ninja Cleaner. One of them is actually the base project for the plugin SDK as well, so they're quite essential to the life of Ninja Cleaner. You can take a look at them <a href=""https://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/drummerboy0511"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Codeplex - Josh Fongheiser"">here</a>.</li>
</ul><p>And, of course, if you've donated and have access to the alpha, there are some additional things you can do to help:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Offer Feedback.</strong> I can't stress this enough: I need to know what you think of Ninja Cleaner, as well as what works and what doesn't. Follow the link in Ninja Cleaner in order to tell me your thoughts!</li>
<li>
<strong>Write Documentation.</strong> My development time is focused on programming. While I could write a help file for Ninja Cleaner, I would also appreciate someone's collaborative help with writing it.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Thank you very much for checking out this fundraiser; I appreciate it! If you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave them either here or in <a href=""http://crowdfundingforum.com/showthread.php/5440-(Indiegogo)-Ninja-Cleaner?p=9197"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this thread</a>!</p></div>","Summary

Also, God willing, Ninja Cleaner will come with support for plugins that third parties can write in order to extend its capabilities.
In addition to including features that other applications don't have, Ninja Cleaner uses open-source projects in its code base. As a result, the projects help Ninja Cleaner grow, and vice versa. Also, I am an independent developer who eventually wants to make a living from programming, either for myself or for other companies. Ninja Cleaner is written by one guy who simply wants to get his project out there.
Why I Need Money
While I've managed to work without much help and resources up to this point, I'm going to need both in order to make Ninja Cleaner a success. Here's a general idea of what I intend to use the money for:


Windows Licenses. This should be pretty self-explanatory.

Android Devices. I need Android tablets and/or phones in order to test the (hopefully) future Android version of Ninja Cleaner.

Advertising. I would like Ninja Cleaner to have as much exposure as possible, and that requires advertising.

Artwork. Advertising won't mean much if Ninja Cleaner doesn't have a proper mascot to represent it.

Translations. I'd like Ninja Cleaner to be as accessible to as many people as possible, and this means that it should be available in as many languages as possible.

Development Tools. I may have to buy another program or two to either add some details to this version of Ninja Cleaner, or to help me create other ones.

Unexpected Costs. They crop up. Life throws curveballs.
 

 
What You Get
No matter what you donate, you're getting your own copy of Ninja Cleaner a month before it's officially released to the public (God willing, of course)! $5 is the recommended donation, but any donation is fair game to get a copy. Also, your name will land in the credits as a special thank you to you!
If you donate $10 or more, you'll get access to an early version of Ninja Cleaner, starting on June 21st! This early (alpha) version will be very limited; only two cleaning jobs will be enabled, and the custom cleaning job will only clean a few web browsers (Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) and temporary file types. This is mainly so that I can gather feedback and suggestions, as well as so you can see how in-depth I intend to go with Ninja Cleaner. Also, if you send me feedback during the alpha and beta periods, your name will be placed in the credits as a tester.
A donation of $15 or more will grant you access to every plugin to be made for Ninja Cleaner from now until the end of the program's life. Plugin support most likely won't be available until around the full release. If you're a C# or VB.NET developer (or any other .NET developer), $25 will grant you access to the plugin SDK so that you can make your own plugins. A release date for the SDK is to be determined, but that will most likely also be near the time of the full release, God willing. Also, you'll get an extra alpha access link to give to a friend!
$50 will grant you all of the above, as well as free copies of Ninja Cleaner for all other platforms it's written for. Also, you will get to help decide what platform it gets written for first!
Finally, a donation of $100 or more will allow you to download copies of any other program that I officially develop and release, regardless of how much I normally sell it for. You get access to everything!
 

 
What's Next?
As the fundraiser goes on, I plan on coding core features for Ninja Cleaner so that it can be as fully-functional as possible as quickly as possible. The beta is set to be released several months after the alpha, and the final release shouldn't be too far after that. I can't give any specific dates, but I would like to have the full release finished before either the end of this year or early next year. After the Ninja Cleaner beta or full release, I plan on beginning a new port for Ninja Cleaner for a different platform. What platform? I don't know yet. God willing, I guess I'll have to keep you posted.
Besides working on Ninja Cleaner, I have some browser extensions that should be worked on, along with a small app for mobile devices and the web. Other than that... who knows? So many ideas, so little time.
Other Ways to Help
If you're unable to donate, there are other ways you can help with Ninja Cleaner. Here's just a few of the ways you can help:


Spread the Word. The more people that know about this fundraiser, the better.

Translate. I would like Ninja Cleaner to be available in many languages. If you have a fluent understanding in another language, please get a hold of me! We can work something out!

Code. I currently maintain two open-source projects on Codeplex, and they're both used in Ninja Cleaner. One of them is actually the base project for the plugin SDK as well, so they're quite essential to the life of Ninja Cleaner. You can take a look at them here.
And, of course, if you've donated and have access to the alpha, there are some additional things you can do to help:


Offer Feedback. I can't stress this enough: I need to know what you think of Ninja Cleaner, as well as what works and what doesn't. Follow the link in Ninja Cleaner in order to tell me your thoughts!

Write Documentation. My development time is focused on programming. While I could write a help file for Ninja Cleaner, I would also appreciate someone's collaborative help with writing it.
 
Thank you very much for checking out this fundraiser; I appreciate it! If you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave them either here or in this thread!",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Greg's Story</h3>
<p>Greg Dixon is a hardy soul. He hunts moose every year to provide for his family and shares with others. He also fishes each summer. In fact, it is not unusual for him to leave Fairbanks on a Friday after work, drive 320 miles to Chitina, unpack his dipnet and some Pilot Bread (TM), and fish from the rocky riverside. He'll stay for a day or two to catch some of those beautiful Alaskan Copper River red salmon, then return to Fairbanks for work or more play. Or it's back to work at the  gold mine.</p>
<p>Greg works at a gold mine somewhere north of the Glenn Highway, in one of those mountain valleys none of us have ever seen, and probably never will. Greg and several people live there throughout the summer, hoping to leave a little richer, and maybe even a little wiser.</p>
<p>When he's gone during the summer, Greg leaves wife Sasha, born and raised in Fairbanks, and three children, ages five, eight, and ten. The kids have been schooled at home and their playground is the great outdoors. Sasha and Greg and their friends teach their children by teaching them their surroundings. They plant and grow a garden and greenhouse organically. The kids run barefoot everywhere. They need a bath in the summer all the time, but forget it, they will be dirty again in an hour.</p>
<p>Imagine the horrifying news in December when they found out that Greg had cancer of the colon. Later, they learned the cancer had metastasized to the liver, making it necessary to postpone surgery.</p>
<h3>Why We Are Fundraising </h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Between November when Greg first saw a doctor in Fairbanks, Alaska and January when Greg began receiving chemotherapy treatment in Katy, TX, Greg and Sasha had accumulated over $50,000 in medical bills. Greg is seeing an oncologist in private practice who was trained at the renowned MD Anderson. This reduces the bills by not having the high overhead associated with MD Anderson. They have also received some assistance from pharmaceutical companies who are willing to provide medication at a discount. Some of Greg's treatment costs are now being covered by private medical insurance, but some are not. The cost of the hospital stays, oncologist, chemotherapy, and upcoming surgeries (at least two) are accumulating at a staggering rate.  </p>
<p><strong>The Dixon Family </strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Greg grew up on Cordes Way in Goldstream Valley and went to West Valley High School. His father, Larry Dixon, moved his family to Fairbanks from Florida, where he had worked at Cape Canaveral. Unfortunately, Larry passed away in December, soon after Greg learned he had cancer, and before Greg could return to Anchor Point to see him again. Greg's mother Fran continues to live in Anchor Point where she is an avid quilter. Greg has three sisters: Carla, Paula, and Lynette. Lynette has temporarily re-located to Texas to help Sasha and Greg by looking after their children while her own children are at home.  </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We know some people want to help but are unable to give any financial assistance. You can still help by sharing Greg's story and by keeping Greg and Sasha and their family in your prayers. </p>
<p><strong>Thank you! </strong></p>

<p>Late in November 2011, I underwent a nine and a half hour surgery to remove my thyroid gland and a sizeable tumor from the side of my neck - thyroid cancer had metastasized into my lymph nodes. It had been growing slowly for years. With 3 small kids, my own care always fell to the bottom of my to-do list.</p>
<p>Surgical healing took many months and was eased by the incredible support of our friends and family. Restoring endocrinological balance - which is required to 'feel well' - is a goal not yet reached. Those close to me know that it has been 15 months of intense chronic pain and fatigue, while managing the kids and my business. As my husband and I are both self-employed since his layoff 2 1/2 years ago, medical fees and the demands and limitations of recovery have ravaged us financially. We have been driven to work hard to turn our finances toward 'the black' - I only took 3 weeks off work right after the surgery - yet my perpetually compromised health has been painting a bleak future outlook for sometime now. I have only been able to cope, not heal.</p>
<p>I am getting the allopathic medicines correct after a long fight and bad luck (or medical negligence - however you want to frame it), and working to get the nutritional supplements fine tuned to support the replacement meds. I'm just a wee bit up from bottom and hopefully headed in the right direction. Yet the physical experience of the last 15 months has left me with little hope that my body can fully eliminate the cancer already in me not to mention fight off anything else coming down the pipeline.</p>
<p>Panchakarma (""PK"") is an intensive healing program offered by traditional Indian medicine, Aruyveda. It is a month-long process led by an Aruyvedic doctor which includes thorough cleansing and deep restoration through numerous treatments, Aruyvedic medicines, and medicinal foods. There are many stories of malignant tumors shrinking dramatically after treatment, as well as general deep healing and transformation. I have no doubt that this treatment would be the turnaround my body and life have been needing, but had given up on being able to do. I have a lot I need to be healthy for: my kids, a career in mid-ascent, loads of bills to pay, and helping others.</p>
<p>The cost of flights and treatment amount to $5000. The doctor has already allowed me to produce photos in exchange for the cost of my accomodations at the center. Perhaps just a little bit from a lot of people could help make this happen for me.</p>

Hello, You've reached the Fundraising page for
The Dorset Destroyers.
Dorset's 1st Wheelchair Rugby Club
We are a THESE ABILITIES Sports Club, not Disabilities 

http://thedorsetdestroyers.weebly.com/media-articles.html


Having been able bodied many years ago, and slowly getting more and more disabled every year, it made me realise that I really have to take life by the balls and do it.

So, we are currently fundraising like mad, while we have some Taster Sessions running to see if it was just Paul and I who wanted to play or if there really was demand.
Our 1st Taster Session bought in 5 players, which we were quite impressed by. The 2nd one bought in 11 players, and the 3rd one we are expecting 13!!
So, we've got the players in place, we have a Venue, funding for 1 and a half Wheelchairs, but we know need to get another 15, as the final taster has 15 players attending.
Each Wheelchair costs £2,600 as it's built to protect the player when being hit. (Hit seems like such a tame word, when you have a 15 stone ex Soldier bearing down on you in a Wheelchair, because you have the ball)
In total we need to be able to raise another £39,000 to be able to play, that's without the cost of the Hall hire, the balls, hoists to help players getting in and out of the Chairs.
So, we don't stop at £2,600 we just keep going and going. It will happen, and in years to come our aim is to have players playing in the Paralympics.
The thing about Wheelchair Rugby/Killerball/Murderball (Call it what you will) is that it really does prove that Disabled People are just as competitive as our able bodied compatriots.
Our Club is based around the ethos of a Rugby Club, we play, supporters come along to watch, we meet after for a drink, chat, bit of fun and we go out for Socials, whether to a Pub/Quiz Night or a BBQ.
Everyone who plays and supports this Club takes it personally and shares the same ideas and passion that the players do.
It's not only a great way to exercise, but a great way to change people's lives. 
We've had people crying and saying it's changed their sons life.
Confidence levels are boosted way beyond what anyone of us was expecting.
The beaming smiles tell it all. Wheelchair Rugby is more than just a game, it's a route back in for some people, a way to remind people that they are more than just a disabled person sitting in a Wheelchair.

<p>This page was setup by Paul's close friends and family when we realized he was too modest to ask for help. He's the type of guy that will never burden anyone else with his problems, but in this case, he needed us and we were happy to rise up for the occasion. We created this fundraising effort in order to assist Paul with his medical expenses during this difficult time so that he can focus his efforts on his health and overcoming the disease.</p>
<p>We've all heard this story before, but the road to recovery is a long one and it hasn't even reached its halfway point for Paul. The whole process is expected to take an entire year from his life. That's a year that could have been better spent working on more films like The Avengers, Planet of the Apes, and Looper! An entire year he could have spent bettering the lives of others and putting his friends before himself-- something he STILL does despite his condition. Paul has been there for so many of us and now its time to help him and show how much we appreciate everything he does.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/542935/files/20140429122533-fdsfds.jpg?1398799533"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>On November 22, 2013 Paul's life changed forever. A mother's intuition inspired a search for answers when she noticed an irregularity on her son's facial appearance. What began as a brief holiday visit back to Houston, quickly turned into days and weeks of doctor visits. Suspicion of infection along the right side of his inner cheek lead to multiple tests searching for answers. All the while he and his family hoped for a simple solution but had to act fast without insurance or aid from his employer because he works as a freelance artist. </p>
<p>Finally, on December 13th there was an answer, but not one we had anticipated. His doctors discovered that Paul had a rare form of cancer called Rhabdomyosarcoma. It's a fast growing cancer that requires immediate and intense treatment. Overnight Paul was forced to give up his passion and career in film, and immediately disconnect from his life in Los Angeles to move back with his family in Houston, Texas.</p>
<p>Thousands of dollars had been spent getting to this point, and having no insurance made deciding what to do next very difficult. After viewing his limited options, it seemed their best was to enroll in a county-based health care system called the Harris Health System. Fortunately the process was expedited and allowed him to get to the health care he desperately needed. Having healthcare options on their side has given them hope for the future, but much of the damage has already been done. </p>
<p>Paul and his family are still monetarily accountable for both his past and future tests, doctor visits, and long hospital stays, not to mention standard living expenses as well. Our goal is $10,000, but we hope to raise much more as his medical treatment expenses continue. Any level of support is greatly appreciated, and we truly thank you for taking interest in Paul's story.</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/542896/files/20140429120804-544328_10100276262744437_466342488_n.jpg?1398798484"" src="""" style=""""/></p>A message from Paul:<br/>It wasn't till about December 13th that I had an idea of what I was up against.<br/><br/>I have cancer; its called Rhabdomyosarcoma.

<p>Hello I am Don, for the past 17 years I have been a Personal Trainer in New York City working on Training &amp; Nutrition For Clients in New York, on the morning of March 23rd I was going to the Gym to meet with a Client when I slipped &amp; fell on the Ice hitting my Arm on the Concrete. My Wrist was Dislocated then Reset &amp; X Rays showed a Fracture on my Ulna Bone on the Left Arm. Over the Past Month we have tried to Heal the Arm Without Surgery but it is needed to get my Arm to Heal completely.</p>
<p>My Insurance will Pay for a Percentage of the Medical Bills &amp; some of the Physical Therapy but I will not be able to work for an estimated 4 Months more and the Medical Bills are adding up. My Personal Expenses are being covered by my Boyfriend Tom's Salary but our savings have been Depleted by all these Medical Bills and every Day there are more Bills in the Mail.</p>
<p>Any and all donations will be directly helping Me with the Medical Bills, including funds that exceed the goal limit.</p>

<div>Hallo Zusammen,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>mein Name ist Barbara bin 32 Jahre alt und ich habe ein massives Lipödem an beiden Armen und Beinen. Diese Krankheit kann man leider nur durch eine Liposuktion bekämpfen welche aber nicht von der Krankenkasse bezahlt wird.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Nach der Geburt meiner Tochter ist es so schlimm geworden, dass ich innerhalb von kurzer Zeit 40kg schwerer wurde. Ich kann nun kaum laufen und habe sehr starke Schmerzen.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Die Kosten für die Liposuktionen kann ich alleine leider nicht aufbringen, da es mehrere Operationen sind und ich nicht genug Geld alleine zusammensparen kann.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ihr würdet mir sehr helfen ein bisschen mehr Lebensgefühl zu bekommen.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Mein Hintergrund:</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ich leide seit Anfang der Pubertät an etwas dickeren Beinen. Immer wurde mir gesagt, dass ich Diät und Sport machen soll. Es wurde immer schlimmer aber nichts hat geholfen. Seit der Geburt meiner Tochter ist die Krankheit explodiert. Ich habe 3ocm Umfang an den Beinen zugenommen (pro Seite!) und bin nun insgesamt 40 kg schwerer als vorher. Alles nur an Armen und Beinen und ohne eine Chance auf natürlichem Weg das ganze wieder los zu werden.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ich habe seit 2008 3 mal in der Woche 2 Stunden lang Lymphdrainage, quäle mich in Kompressionsstrümpfe und lege mich in einen Kompressionsautomaten für zuhause und sehr starke Schmerzen bei jeder Bewegung. Wirklich helfen tut das aber leider nicht.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Der einzige Ausweg ist ein Operationsmarathon wo das ganze kranke Gewebe mit Hilfe der sogenannten Liposuktion abgesaugt wird.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Aufgrund der schwere der Erkrankung sind insgesamt 6 Operationen nötig.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Wenn diese nicht erfolgen Ende ich im Rollstuhl, kann mich nicht mehr bewegen und muss dem Schicksal ins Auge sehen sogenannte Elefantenbeine zu bekommen. Dies ist das Endstadium der Krankheit und ich habe da wahnsinnige Angst vor.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Eine Operation kann das aufhalten!!!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Genauere Infos gibt es auf Facebook. Sucht einfach nach Babses Lipo und addet mich :)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Jeder Spender darf dort gerne sich verlinken und den weiteren Werdegang mitverfolgen.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ich Stelle dort Hintergrundinfos online und werde Berichten wie es weiter geht.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Als Anreiz mir zu helfen habe ich mir folgendes ausgedacht.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>25 € - Ein Vorher Nachher Bild von mir im Original per Post mit einem persönlichen Gruss</div>
<div> </div>
<div>75 € - Ein von mir gebackener Kuchen / Torte</div>

<div>150 € - Ein Kalender mit Bergpanorama - Aufnahmen mit persönlicher Widmung von mir (Bilder alle von mir selbst geschossen)</div>

<div> </div>
<div>500 € - Einladung zu einem 3 Gänge Menue - bei mir und meiner Familie von mir gekocht für 2 Personen.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Wenn das erzielte Geld nicht komplett für alle Liposuktionen reichen sollte, so ist wenigstens schon ein Anfang gemacht und ich kann evtl 1 oder 2 Liposuktionen davon bezahlen.</div>

I had two main problems with traditional pullup bars:</p><p>1) There's nowhere to store them. They just take up so much space.</p><p>2) They're impossible to travel with.

<p> </p></figure></div><p>Keeping up a consistent workout routine is difficult enough. It's even harder when you have to stop and restart your workout routine.

<p><b>Yes, we ship to frequent travelers.</b> </p>
<p>Digital nomad living in Chiang Mai, Barcelona or Costa Rica? We got you covered. </p>
<p>We can ship your pullup bar anywhere in the world, and only ask for your address as we're about to ship it. That way, even if you're not sure where you'll be by the time we're ready to ship, you'll still be able to get your Flexr.</p>
<p>If you're unsure where you'll be when you receive the Flexr, just select U.S. shipping for now. You'll pay the difference in shipping costs once we're actually shipping the product.</p>
<p>We're projecting a ship date of January 2018. Just in time for New Year's resolutions!</p>

<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>Nobody wants to wait longer than necessary for a product they're excited about. We've worked very hard to get this product as close to fulfillment as possible, before going to Kickstarter. That said, here are the risks we see moving forward:</p>
<p>MANUFACTURING: Because the Flexr uses similar parts to other fitness products, most of it can be manufactured fairly easily. However, the folding top bracket and the weight bearing bottom clip are injection molded plastic and casted aluminum. Creating the tooling and castings for these two parts generally takes about 30 days, and this is where delays can happen. We're working with manufacturers with a history of prompt delivery to minimize that possibility.</p>
<p>PRODUCT CHANGES: As the Flexr gets closer to final production, there will likely be some minor improvements made to the final product. These will always be made with the end user in mind. Any changes we make will be communicated to you prior to receiving the product, and we'll always let you know exactly why and how the product was changed.</p>
<p>FULFILLMENT:</p>
<p>Our team has experience shipping products to thousands of customers in over a dozen different countries. That said, unforseen circumstances can occur that can cause delays in shipping. To reduce that risk, we've identified specific logistics providers we want to work with, and have already began the process of setting up shipping with them.</p>

</div></div>","We've created the world's first foldable, easy to store, travel-friendly pullup bar. I'm thrilled to introduce you to Flexr. Flexr works just like any other pullup bar, with one big difference: once you finish your workout, it folds up to a 2 ft by 1 ft by 6 inch form that's compact and easy to store.  Traditional pullup bars are bulky, difficult to store, and impossible to travel with. It's a bulky contraption that people handle with difficulty. It's something people have tolerated for too long - no more!Hi - My name's Derek, I'm the co-founder of the Flexr pullup bar. I had two main problems with traditional pullup bars:1) There's nowhere to store them. They just take up so much space.2) They're impossible to travel with. Every time I went traveling, I had to break my workout routine. Where do you put a pullup bar? Most of the time it looked like this - somewhere out of place:That's why I decided to create the Flexr, the world's first foldable pullup bar.
 Keeping up a consistent workout routine is difficult enough. It's even harder when you have to stop and restart your workout routine. Every time you break your routine, it makes it much more difficult to get things started again. Most people have to break their routine when they go traveling.That's why I wanted to have a pullup bar that I could carry with me no matter where I went. Having a pullup bar that you can take with you anywhere you go makes it easy to keep up your routine - whether you're at home or in Africa. 
 The Flexr is a major upgrade over most other pullup bars - even if you're not traveling. Why?Most pullup bars are so bulky that there's no practical place to put them. With Flexr, you can easily slip it under your bed or in a spare drawer. It goes from a ""where do I put this thing?"" to an afterthought.   So, how do you actually use the Flexr? It's easy: just latch the pullup bar into your doorway. The sturdy top side lays on top of the door, while the door grips go on the other side. Then you're ready to get started with your workout!   
 You're ambitious and adventurous. You want to enjoy life to the fullest and experience all that the world has to offer.But you can’t do it unless you are taking care of your body and working out.You can only work hard and play hard when you’ve got an abundance of energy and vitality from eating health and working out. Using a pull-up bar is a great way to improve your workout. The problem is, common products on the market are ugly, hard to store and can’t easily be traveled with. Most pull up bars force you to sacrifice your apartment space, and don’t travel well. You shouldn’t need to make sacrifices when it comes to working out. So, as product designers with over 10 years of experience, who have used dozens of pull-up bars in the past 15 years of our lives, we made something better.
 Flexr is made of three light yet durable materials:
The top door rest is made of injection molded plastic. That's the same stuff that iPhone cases are made from.
The bars themselves are made from bent steel. The same type of steel used in steam ships.
The center latch is made from aircraft-grade aluminum. 
The entire pullup bar only weighs 6 pounds. You can slip it in your luggage, without tipping over those pesky airline weight limits.

<p> </p>
<p>The Light Outreach charity aims to alleviate poverty and relieve the distress of the homeless. We offer homeless and disadvantaged people the opportunity to fulfil their potential and move towards an independent and optimistic future. We help children in street circumstances to realise their rights and their potential. Their potential is our inspiration and we aim to guide them in leaving the streets, by offering them stable living conditions, health care, education and training.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Light Outreach street workers go out onto the streets of Tema and Accra on a weekly basis meeting children,  in their current environment, communicating with them and providing them with food. From this introduction, the street workers are able to befriend the children and introduce TLO house of refuge to them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Light Outreach was renting a property for about 30 street children and orphans. The lease ended earlier this year and the landlord advised us the lease will not be renewed as it wasn’t profitable.</p>
<p>This left 30 children between the ages of 1 - 21 potentially homeless. We were forced to move all the children under our care into an unfinished building. The building is the Shekinah Home we were building but have been unable to complete due to the lack of funds and unforeseen circumstances. At this present time the building is unsecure and can be hazardous, consequently it is important we raise £15,000 to complete the building of Shekinah home, subsequently the children who are currently housed and new comers can have a safe environment to live in. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What We want to Do?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our current plan is to build a children's home in the Greater Accra Region, Tema, called “Shekinah Children’s Home”. The home will house 50 orphans and street children. Currently there is an estimate of 33,000 children living on the streets in Ghana. The children’s home will provide a safe environment where street children can be housed and educated. In order to complete the building of Shekinah Children’s Home in Tema, The Light Outreach needs to raise a further £15,000.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>10 young adults from the UK have come together and said they will participate in an exhilarating 13,000 ft  charity sky dive to help raise the money needed to build Shekinah's  children's home. So if we succesfly meet our target  on August 31st  the 10 young addults  will perform a 13,000 ft tandum skydive with UK Parachuting all in the sipport of  building the 'Shekinah Children's Home' in Tema, Ghana. The home will house and care for upto 50 orphans and homeless children in great need. So please help us to reach our targtet.</strong></p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Ever wonder how you can really make a difference in the world?  Okay, I know it sounds cheesy, but this is something that's been pestering me for a while.  My name is Natalie, and I've recently been awarded a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make some big change as a <a href=""http://www.kiva.org/fellows"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Kiva Fellow</a> in YaoundÃ©, Cameroon... but I need your help! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Recently, I graduated from the <a href=""http://www.miis.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Monterey Institute of International Studies</a> with a Masters in Public Administration.  For the past few years I've concentrated on learning innovative and responsible ways to tackle some of the most challenging social problems, both in the US and abroad.  A very successful and promising approach which I strongly support is microfinance.  What exactly is microfinance, you may be asking? Well, in short microfinance is a way for low income individuals, often in developing countries, to access savings, loans and other financial services (check out this nifty <a href=""http://www.cgap.org/p/site/c/template.rc/1.11.947/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""CGAP microfinance page"">resource</a> for more info).  By reducing dependence on donations or foreign aid, microfinance offers a promising way to create long-term economic security so individuals and families can <b>create better lives for themselves.</b></p>

</div><div>
<h3>Where You Come In</h3>
<p>With a little bit of your financial support, we can make a real impact in Cameroon.  In early February 2012, I'll embark on an epic journey across the Atlantic to serve as an <b>unpaid volunteer,</b> working directly with Kiva's field partner <a href=""http://www.ip-dev.com/5-16157-ACEP-Cameroun.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""ACEP Cameroun's homepage"">ACEP Cameroun</a>.  It's up to me to completely fund housing, medical, travel and all other expenses for the fellowship.  Any amount donated will be influential. </p>

<p>So you know exactly where your money will go, here's an abbreviated breakdown of my fellowship budget:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Round-trip flight, California to YaoundÃ©: $1,600</li>
<li>Single-entry visa: $230</li>
<li>Immunization (Yellow fever, malaria, hepatitis, etc.): $150</li>
<li>Training costs: $150</li>

<li>Transportation (bus, taxi, bicycle, etc): $360</li>
<li>Food: $250</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I've applied for a very small grant from a foundation whose generous support provides funding for international community service, so with these fundraising efforts combined I feel I can make the most of my four month fellowship.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The best part is with your contribution you'll get a little piece of Africa for yourself (in addition to the satisfaction of donating to a worthy cause)!  Check out the different types of perks for details. <i> If you decide to contribute, please choose the ""PayPal"" option. </i></p>

The primary focus of the club is to give players the opportunity to pursue their dreams of being a college and /or a professional soccer player. The trip this summer to England goes </span><span>from June 9th through August 6th</span><span> and would allow me to tour the universities, talk to admission officers, and showcase myself to coaches in the area.  </span></p>
<div> </div>
<div>To say a little about myself i moved to the united states at the age of 5 with my mom and my little sisters. I had played on the streets of colombia with my cousins once i got here i joined an academy to play more competitive soccer. Since my young start i fell in love with the sport and decided it was my calling , i have not stopped playing since. Even though i have a passion for soccer i know that my primary obligation is attending college and continuing my education. Three years ago i joined the Mid-City Lions a club that could offer me both of my necessities. Since the age of 13 i have played 3 age groups over what my age is , i am 16 years old and playing in the age group U-19. I have matured mentally and soccer wise i have been prepared to travel outside the country to show my talent. During my time in the club my team has traveled to England and Barcelona to play in some of the most prestigious tournaments in the world yet i haven't been able to attend because of my immigration-status. This year i was able to resolve my status and am allowed to travel outside the country only once and i believe this is a great opportunity that i can not waste.</div>
<div>I was chosen to travel to England with a semi-pro team full of college students and players ranging from 18-23 year olds. I thank full beforehand for your support towards me and the sport.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My parents only have enough money to support me and my two younger sisters. I have a weekend job that pays for my soccer expenses i am saving every little money i get but i need help, any money you donate will help reach my goal all the funds will go straight to my trip.</div>

The primary focus of the club is to give players the opportunity to pursue their dreams of being a college and /or a professional soccer player. The trip this summer to England goes from June 9th through August 6th and would allow me to tour the universities, talk to admission officers, and showcase myself to coaches in the area.  
 
To say a little about myself i moved to the united states at the age of 5 with my mom and my little sisters. I had played on the streets of colombia with my cousins once i got here i joined an academy to play more competitive soccer. Since my young start i fell in love with the sport and decided it was my calling , i have not stopped playing since. Even though i have a passion for soccer i know that my primary obligation is attending college and continuing my education. Three years ago i joined the Mid-City Lions a club that could offer me both of my necessities. Since the age of 13 i have played 3 age groups over what my age is , i am 16 years old and playing in the age group U-19. I have matured mentally and soccer wise i have been prepared to travel outside the country to show my talent. During my time in the club my team has traveled to England and Barcelona to play in some of the most prestigious tournaments in the world yet i haven't been able to attend because of my immigration-status. This year i was able to resolve my status and am allowed to travel outside the country only once and i believe this is a great opportunity that i can not waste.
I was chosen to travel to England with a semi-pro team full of college students and players ranging from 18-23 year olds. I thank full beforehand for your support towards me and the sport.
 
My parents only have enough money to support me and my two younger sisters. I have a weekend job that pays for my soccer expenses i am saving every little money i get but i need help, any money you donate will help reach my goal all the funds will go straight to my trip.
Thank you for your time

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are a group of colleagues from South Shore Hospital, including members of the rehabilitation and nursing departments, plus a few friends, who have joined together to run the Ragnar Relay. It will be our 3rd time running this race and we do it because there really is no other situation where you find yourself running in the middle of the night in rural New England with only a headlamp to light your way.</p>
<p><strong>What is Ragnar?</strong></p>
<p>Ragnar is an overnight running relay race that makes testing your limits a team sport. A team is made up of 6-12 individuals; each individual runs 3 legs. The legs of the race vary in difficulty and distance, from 3-8 miles, allowing elite and novice runners to run together. Over 2 days and 1 night, teams run 200 miles. Pair that with crazy costumes, inside jokes, and unforgettable stories. You might call it a race. We call it Ragnar.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.ragnarrelayne.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ragnarrelayne.com</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Over the past 3 years, South Shore Hospital has worked to bring cancer care closer to people in our community through the programs that are provided at our Cancer Center. This year, the Ragnar race course has changed and it runs closer to the community that we serve in our daily work at the hospital. In light of this change, we have decided to step up our game this year and put our running energy and efforts at team building towards a good cause: The South Shore Hospital Campaign for Healing, Caring, and Comforting, which supports the expansion of programs including cancer care, inpatient care, outpatient orthopedic, Visiting nurse and Hospice,  all of which improve upon treatment of individuals in our community.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to fulfill our commitment to run this race as a team and together support a good cause, we need your help! We have estimated that it will cost about $200 per team member to complete this race, with costs going to van rentals, gear, food, water, etc. We are committed to giving a minimum of 25% of donations received to South Shore Hospital's Charitable Foundation for the Campaign for Healing, Caring, and Comforting. What do you get? Check out our list of perks! And please keep in mind, any donations are greatly appreciated. </p>

<div>The SpotLoss Fob allows you to press a button on the fob to find your phone, or a button on your phone to find your fob. Additionally, it is a proximity alert system.

<div> </div>
<div>Besides an audible or vibrating alarm, you can also be notified to a change in proximity by text or email. And, since SpotLoss uses low power technology, you don't have to worry about recharging the battery weekly or monthly.</div>
<p><em> </em></p>
<h2>The SpotLoss Fob</h2>
<p><span>The fob runs for roughly a year on a replaceable watch battery without having to remember to recharge it. It measures 5.6 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm and the carabiner style design allows it to quickly latch onto nearly anything. </span></p>

<p><span>The communication with external devices (cell phones or computers) is handled using a many-to-many relationship, meaning one fob can be connected to multiple external devices, and one external device can be connected to multiple fobs.

Diagnosed at birth with Cerebral Palsy, Dylan spends each and every day motivated to reach his DREAM of walking and living a “Life Without Limits”. The hope is that we can reach our goal of $25,000 and provide a year’s worth of specialized assistance with physical and occupational therapy that isn’t covered by insurance. <br/><br/> As a parent I continue to push and encourage Dylan every day to live with confidence, pride and determination, not allowing Cerebral Palsy to affect his quality of life. My constant reminders to him are to never quit, never give up and stay strong!  I tell him that he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to; he can grow up and be whoever he wants to be. The words ""I can't"" are not allowed to be spoken.<br/><br/><img alt=""Dylan gets ready for his Grand Prix race"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.supportcp.org/images/Images/dylan-reving-up-his-engine.png"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;""/>Your contribution is the backbone of fulfilling Dylan’s dream of walking and improving his day-to-day activities. The importance of this campaign is beyond words. Reaching his ultimate goal of walking (unassisted) would be a colossal achievement for Dylan and a step in the right direction for continued growth.<br/><br/><strong>What is CP?</strong><br/> Cerebral Palsy is a group of chronic conditions affecting body movement and muscle coordination. It is caused by damage to one or more specific areas of the brain, usually occurring during fetal development; before, during, or shortly after birth; or during infancy. Thus, these disorders are not caused by problems in the muscles or nerves. Instead, faulty development or damage to motor areas in the brain disrupt the brain's ability to adequately control movement and posture. It also contributes to muscle weakness and poor control. <br/><br/><img alt=""Dylan enjoys his day at the Pine Wood Derby"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.supportcp.org/images/Images/dylan-and-boy-scouts.png"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;""/>Cerebral palsy itself is not progressive (i.e. brain damage does not get worse); however, secondary conditions, such as muscle spasticity, can develop which may get better over time, get worse, or remain the same. <strong>Although cerebral palsy is not ""curable"" in the accepted sense, training and therapy can help improve function</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>What We Need</strong><br/> Our goal is to raise $25,000.00 (in 60 days) to fund a full calendar year of occupational and physical therapy sessions. Due to our nation’s current insurance restrictions and the inadequate programs offered by employers, Dylan <strong>DOES NOT</strong> receive the appropriate therapy necessary to improve and regulate his growth and fine motor skill development.<br/><br/> The financial effects of Cerebral Palsy on a family can be very difficult to overcome, as well as the pressures and frustration that come with it. <br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.supportcp.org/images/Images/thanks-for-your-support.png"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;"" title=""Thanks for your SUPPORT!""/><strong>What You Get<br/></strong>By donating, you will have the opportunity to track Dylan’s progress via monthly progress reports, media galleries of his therapy sessions and detailed payment reports to the various organizations providing his occupational and physical therapy.

As a parent I continue to push and encourage Dylan every day to live with confidence, pride and determination, not allowing Cerebral Palsy to affect his quality of life. My constant reminders to him are to never quit, never give up and stay strong!  I tell him that he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to; he can grow up and be whoever he wants to be. The words ""I can't"" are not allowed to be spoken.Your contribution is the backbone of fulfilling Dylan’s dream of walking and improving his day-to-day activities. The importance of this campaign is beyond words. Reaching his ultimate goal of walking (unassisted) would be a colossal achievement for Dylan and a step in the right direction for continued growth.What is CP? Cerebral Palsy is a group of chronic conditions affecting body movement and muscle coordination. It is caused by damage to one or more specific areas of the brain, usually occurring during fetal development; before, during, or shortly after birth; or during infancy. Thus, these disorders are not caused by problems in the muscles or nerves. Instead, faulty development or damage to motor areas in the brain disrupt the brain's ability to adequately control movement and posture. It also contributes to muscle weakness and poor control. Cerebral palsy itself is not progressive (i.e. brain damage does not get worse); however, secondary conditions, such as muscle spasticity, can develop which may get better over time, get worse, or remain the same. Although cerebral palsy is not ""curable"" in the accepted sense, training and therapy can help improve function.What We Need Our goal is to raise $25,000.00 (in 60 days) to fund a full calendar year of occupational and physical therapy sessions. Due to our nation’s current insurance restrictions and the inadequate programs offered by employers, Dylan DOES NOT receive the appropriate therapy necessary to improve and regulate his growth and fine motor skill development. The financial effects of Cerebral Palsy on a family can be very difficult to overcome, as well as the pressures and frustration that come with it. What You GetBy donating, you will have the opportunity to track Dylan’s progress via monthly progress reports, media galleries of his therapy sessions and detailed payment reports to the various organizations providing his occupational and physical therapy. You can feel confident that EVERY dollar donated will be used for direct services! Also, be sure to take advantage of our SUPPORTCP.ORG PERKS!  Limited availability! If you require additional information about SupportCP or just want to follow along with Dylan’s adventures, please visit us at www.supportcp.org.

Sharing with your networks will provide us an opportunity to share Dylan’s DREAM and improve awareness of the needs of a successful campaign. Thank you so much for anything you can do to help.
How Funds Will be ManagedEvery dollar raised through this campaign will be used to help Dylan reach his goal of walking. This includes all therapist costs, therapy sessions and additional assistance that may be required to help him realize his DREAM.  Even though Dylan can walk and maneuver with his walker, it’s his desire to walk side by side with his twin brother that motivates his vision of a “Life Without Limits”.Thank You Every effort is made to push Dylan in reaching his potential, with a constant focus on “Life Without Limits”. Because of people like you and the numerous charities and organizations that work tirelessly around the clock to enrich the lives of others, no parent or child that deals with Cerebral Palsy can ever say THANK YOU enough!

</div></div>","“One of the hottest applications of acupuncture”



“The slender wand rotates with gentle, soothing motion to promote lymphatic drainage while smoothing and tightening the eye area, cheeks, and neck”



“We saw instant lift after the first treatment”



“My internal energy feels much more balanced”

 ""I was blown away"" 
- Bobbi Brown, CCO Bobbi Brown Cosmetics
 
""My Personal use of Touch + Glow™ confirms that it keeps your face looking younger."" 
- Diane Kraus, M.D.
 The Touch + Glow System combines the power of acupressure with magnetized therapy, gentle vibration, and Germanium to produce a brighter, tighter, youthful look and feel. 
Acupressure stimulates internal energy at the local site and throughout the body via energetic pathways corresponding to each point.
Better circulation allows toxins to be flushed more quickly and also enables more nutrients to reach the layers of tissue that need them to produce healthy new tissue skin.
Proper lymphatic drainage reduces fluid retention that can cause puffiness.


Magnetism further enhances circulation, improves moisture retention, and activates tissue to firm and tone loose skin and deeper layers.
Germanium is a precious metal with semi-conductive and anti-oxidant properties. Germanium balances the skin’s bio-electrical field by absorbing the harmful positively charged ions that can damage healthy tissue.

 No matter how small or large, your contribution counts.  To explore market interest and evaluate user feedback, a limited run of Touch + Glow kits were produced in 2015. Rave reviews from consumers and press earned Touch + Glow instant success and notoriety. With continued interest from conglomerates, we are now seeking capital needed to validate our product and fulfill growing consumer demand. “About 59 million Americans spend money out-of-pocket on complementary health approaches, and their total spending adds up to $30.2 billion a year.”

- National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
1. Clinical trials
Touch + Glow is more than just a beauty treatment. It’s a unique and innovative body, mind, spirit approach to looking and feeling your best. According to the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the NCCIH, clinical trials using innovative study designs to assess complementary health approaches and their integration into health care are one of the top scientific priorities. In order to quantify our positive feedback from Touch + Glow we intend to test our product utilizing objective outcome measures.
2. Refinement and expansion of our Touch + Glow jewel tool
Based on learnings from clinical trial results, it is our intention to expand our product line beginning with our new jewel tool.
3. Production of our Touch + Glow jewel tool

What is the Touch + Glow system?



The Touch + Glow system consists of an enhanced acupressure device (“wand”) along with a specific sequence of points to reboot face and body. An easy-to-follow instruction page and video is included and can also be downloaded on your phone, iPad, or computer.



What is the Touch + Glow wand? And how does it work?



The Touch + Glow wand is a battery-powered device for performing enhanced acupressure. Although acupressure is traditionally performed manually (with hands or fingers), the Touch + Glow wand stimulates each point more precisely and with additional benefits. The wand contains Germanium, a rare metal with unique material properties that amplify the effects of stimulation when applied to specific points. Gentle vibrations combine with magnetism and the power of acupressure to produce a brighter, healthier complexion with added health benefits.



How long does it take to see a difference?



When Touch + Glow is used according to the simple instructions, results can be seen (and felt!) immediately. A vibrant, glowing complexion is noticeable after each use of Touch + Glow, and the results are cumulative. With consistent, continued practice for 30 consecutive days, the system will yield long-lasting results including toned, tightened, invigorated skin, a reduction in the appearance of fine lines, and an overall improvement in general health and well-being.



Do I need to do the regimen everyday?



For best results, follow the protocol for 30 consecutive days. After this initial period, use 2 or 3 times per week and on special occasions when you want to look great (and feel great too)!



Will the results go away if I stop using Touch + Glow?



Touch + Glow is like taking your face to the gym. Once you are satisfied with the results of your treatments you can maintain it by repeating 2-3 times a week and anytime you would like a facial “tune up.”



Should I use Touch + Glow in the morning or at night?



Use Touch + Glow whenever is most convenient. No need to remove make-up before use, so you can even keep a pair of wands in your desk at work for an easy recharge at the end of the day or as a soothing break instead of coffee.



What happens if I miss a day or two?



For optimal results follow the Touch + Glow regimen on a daily basis. If you miss a day or two, don’t worry - just keep going.



How accurate do I need to be to see results?



The face map and instructions found in the kit have very simple diagrams and instructions to follow along with. You can also watch and follow the Touch + Glow instruction video.



How long does it take to follow the regimen?



Initially it may take 10 to 12 minutes for each side of the face for the full regimen. As you get more familiar with the routine, the time will decrease to about 6 minutes for each side of the face. Using two wands at the same time (one on each side of the face) reduces the treatment time by half. When Touch + Glow users discover how easy it is to use one wand, they often decide to get another wand to treat both sides of the face at once.



Are there any contraindications for using Touch + Glow?

That said, most doctors know about the positive effects of acupressure to treat stress and many other medical conditions. Indeed, the actions of Touch + Glow are based on many of the same principles that modern medicine uses to promote healing.

Please avoid stimulating points other than those outlined in the instructions unless under the care of a physician or a licensed acupuncturist. It is always advisable to consult your physician prior to using the Touch + Glow system.



What is the advantage of using 2 wands at once?



Using 2 wands at once cuts the treatment time in half. Most users find that treating both sides of the face together is twice as enjoyable.



What makes Touch + Glow different from other beauty tools?



Most beauty tools are designed to either enhance product penetration (generally products sold by the beauty tool manufacturer), or simply stimulate superficial circulation. The Touch + Glow system combines the principles of acupressure to address the external appearance and internal health and well being.",68.0,4,"1 Campaign

Over time, your jaw can gradually be pulled down and your head can start to droop. Human behavior like staring at smartphones only makes this worse. Eventually, you can develop what is called a forward head posture. Maintaining forward head posture can <strong>strain the muscles of the neck and back, leading to pain and even worse posture. </strong></p><p>As the jaw continues to drop, your airways will become restricted and this is how <strong>snoring </strong>other sleep-related or everyday life issues can develop.</p><p>With this knowledge, I spent what little time and energy I had leftover to create GODSUMM. With my background in dentistry and mechanical engineering, I developed a blend of materials that would counteract the negative effects of gravity and to finally help me sleep in peace again. </p><p>And I did it.

<p>GODSUMM <strong>combines medical and mechanical engineering techniques</strong> to prevent snoring and teeth grinding, correct cervical posture, and gradually over time reconstruct facial symmetry.</p>
<p>While other tapes and strips can be crudely placed on the face, GODSUMM has been designed to be applied to strategic points on the face to create maximum effects. Our strips gently press the lips together and hold up your jaw by keeping the tongue pressed up against the roof of your mouth, give just the <strong>right amount of mouth flexibility</strong> (in case you want to talk, drink, or chew), and <strong>opens up your nasal passages</strong> for optimal breathing. Gradually you will see GODSUMM work its magic as it <strong>restores the physical integrity of your face, head, and body.</strong></p>
<p>With GODSUMM's <strong>trademark secret</strong>, the blend of construction and adhesive materials. it's finally time to say goodbye to snoring, teeth grinding, bad posture, sleep apnea, and more!    </p>

<p>The male patient shown above participated in our clinical trials for the initial prototype of GODSUMM. This man came to us with symptoms of forward head posture, distorted facial structure (as seen on the initial x-ray), and various sleep issues that occurred because of those two issues. </p>
<p>After using GODSUMM, this participant felt immediate effects and notified us that he no longer had a dry mouth in the morning, his sore throat disappeared, and the cold sores he usually had were no longer there. </p>
<p>After several months, we witnessed his posture slowly improving and he stated that his cervical pain was reduced dramatically. After the end of the trial, his posture was corrected (left image) and his facial symmetry was realigned (right image). All of this was done without any surgical procedures!</p>
<p>We attempted this trial with many more participants and received similar results from almost everyone who participated. By simply bringing the jaw to its correct position during sleep and opening the airway passages, the body was brought back to a state of equilibrium and the evidence clearly showed GODSUMM works!</p>

<p><br/>For all you mouth breathers, you probably have a really bad case of cotton mouth in the morning. This happens because as your breathe, the air that passes through your mouth removes all the moisture. GODSUMM will keep your mouth closed and after a couple of months you'll notice that your mouth will stay closed without the help of GODSUMM! This because your jaws will redevelop the habit of staying together even when you're sleeping.</p>

<p>GODSUMM is a product that is the culmination of our experience and research.<strong> I am a dentist with a degree in mechanical engineering and have personally experienced the negative effects of snoring, sleep apnea, teeth grinding, excessive nighttime bathroom trips, and jaw joint pain. </strong></p>
<p>I have tried various products on the market but was not been able to find a solution that could bring about tangible and long lasting results so I developed a product to help those who have suffered what I have gone through.</p>
<p>One instance that greatly motivated my drive to bring GODSUMM to life was when one of our participants notified us that he no longer had panic attacks during the night as he slept. His doctor discovered that his restricted airways limited the amount of oxygen that he was receiving and that triggered his night time panic attacks. With GODSUMM, he was able to sleep soundly and I was able to clearly see that this was something that more people needed access to!</p>
<p>At the request of my patients at my dental clinic, I began to conduct years of research and finally developed GODSUMM, the product that will help you obtain the best sleep possible.</p>

</tbody></table></div>","What expert thinks1.  Can’t I just use scotch tape or duct tape and obtain the same results?  2.  If I get congestion while I’m asleep, won’t Godsumm prevent me from being able to breathe?

 
3. Why is Godsumm so expensive?

 
 
4. How is it possible for such a simple product to realign facial symmetry and fix chronic bad posture?


 
 
5. Do you have any case studies or clinical trials that you can cite as evidence?


 

 

   A while back, I was diagnosed with sleep apnea and for years I was unable to get a single good nights worth of sleep. This placed a physical and mental toll on my body and I didn't know what to do. During this period of time, I even noticed that there were even physical changes in my facial structure. My face became elongated, my lips no longer naturally curved up, my cheeks were beginning to sag, and I was showing early symptoms of dropped head syndrome (DHS). All of the doctors and specialists that I went to recommended surgical treatments, but it contradicted with what I learned in dental school. The surgeries that they were pushing me to receive were only temporary fixes. I knew that after a few months, these symptoms would come back. And so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I discovered that gravitational pull can throw your body out of its natural state of equilibrium and have a negatively impact on your body. Over time, your jaw can gradually be pulled down and your head can start to droop. Human behavior like staring at smartphones only makes this worse. Eventually, you can develop what is called a forward head posture. Maintaining forward head posture can strain the muscles of the neck and back, leading to pain and even worse posture. As the jaw continues to drop, your airways will become restricted and this is how snoring other sleep-related or everyday life issues can develop.With this knowledge, I spent what little time and energy I had leftover to create GODSUMM. With my background in dentistry and mechanical engineering, I developed a blend of materials that would counteract the negative effects of gravity and to finally help me sleep in peace again. And I did it. I used the prototype versions of GODSUMM on myself and received remarkable results. My sleep apnea was gone, my snoring disappeared, my facial features were restored, and I regained my proper posture! The image on the left is what I looked like before and the image on the right is what I looked like after a couple of months of care with the GODSUMM.I then began to use the GODSUMM on my patients and even discovered that it naturally assisted in teeth realignment. As a result, the number of tooth extraction procedures I had to perform dropped drastically over the years. Snoring is the first symptom that can develop into more serious medical issues.


 

 




 
 


 


 
 

 

GODSUMM combines medical and mechanical engineering techniques to prevent snoring and teeth grinding, correct cervical posture, and gradually over time reconstruct facial symmetry.
While other tapes and strips can be crudely placed on the face, GODSUMM has been designed to be applied to strategic points on the face to create maximum effects. Our strips gently press the lips together and hold up your jaw by keeping the tongue pressed up against the roof of your mouth, give just the right amount of mouth flexibility (in case you want to talk, drink, or chew), and opens up your nasal passages for optimal breathing. Gradually you will see GODSUMM work its magic as it restores the physical integrity of your face, head, and body.
With GODSUMM's trademark secret, the blend of construction and adhesive materials. it's finally time to say goodbye to snoring, teeth grinding, bad posture, sleep apnea, and more!    
 
This is an X-ray image of one of my male patients who used GODSUMM for 4 years.



He is a very old man (80 years old). You're probably younger than him.
You will obtain even better results than him by using GODSUMM.
Let's compare the change of the skull structure before and after.




 
Recovery of the skull structuremeans that the airways, nasal septum, etc. have been restored.




The overnight effects are only the beginning of what GODSUMM can do for you.



 
The male patient shown above participated in our clinical trials for the initial prototype of GODSUMM. This man came to us with symptoms of forward head posture, distorted facial structure (as seen on the initial x-ray), and various sleep issues that occurred because of those two issues. 
After using GODSUMM, this participant felt immediate effects and notified us that he no longer had a dry mouth in the morning, his sore throat disappeared, and the cold sores he usually had were no longer there. 
After several months, we witnessed his posture slowly improving and he stated that his cervical pain was reduced dramatically. After the end of the trial, his posture was corrected (left image) and his facial symmetry was realigned (right image). All of this was done without any surgical procedures!
We attempted this trial with many more participants and received similar results from almost everyone who participated. By simply bringing the jaw to its correct position during sleep and opening the airway passages, the body was brought back to a state of equilibrium and the evidence clearly showed GODSUMM works!

 

 





 
 



 


 
 




 
By keeping the lips pressed together and the jaws closed, contracted airways will naturally reopen, snoring will be prevented, mouth breathing habits will be eliminated, and side effects of nasal breathing will be reduced. All of these benefits will compound when used long-term.
During use, the lips will not dry out, airborne bacteria and viruses will be filtered out, increase in oxygen flow to the brain and lungs to allow for deep sleep. It can also reduce the number of trips to the bathroom at night.
 
 




 
Teeth grinding can reduce the quality of sleep and can cause you to be drowsy even after you’ve slept for long hours. With GODSUMM, the tongue is gently pressed against the roof of the mouth and the lips are pressed together to prevent these negative effects.
 
 


We know that good sleep is key to having a good day. All of the symptoms that GODSUMM is meant to care is meant to drastically increase your sleep quality. Whether it's snoring, sleep apnea, or bathroom trips, GODSUMM has your back!
 


As we mentioned previously, the first prototypes of GODSUMM were used in clinical trials. To our surprise, we discovered that over time, our strips helped restore facial symmetry. The male participant above (x-ray shots) started using our tapes in 2013 and by 2017 the difference was clear!
 


For all you mouth breathers, you probably have a really bad case of cotton mouth in the morning. This happens because as your breathe, the air that passes through your mouth removes all the moisture. GODSUMM will keep your mouth closed and after a couple of months you'll notice that your mouth will stay closed without the help of GODSUMM! This because your jaws will redevelop the habit of staying together even when you're sleeping.
 

 
The picture on the left is a participant in the clinical trial that had the ""head forward posture"" mentioned above. Without the need of chiropractic treatment or surgery, his posture was naturally corrected simply by using GODSUMM!
 
 




Our nasal passages are natural filters against various forms of bacteria and viruses that can cause infections. Breathing through your mouth for hours as you sleep gets rid of this natural defense system. GODSUMM ensures nose breathing throughout the night so that the mucus membranes in your nose work vigorously to exert antimicrobial and antibiotic cells to strengthen your immune system.
 
 




As GODSUMM promotes nasal breathing, more oxygen is supplied to the lungs and the brain, which stimulates blood circulation throughout the body. This helps to reduce muscle cramping and prevents the bladder from shrinking during sleep. 
 
 


Pain that originates in the jaw and the joints can become worse if you sleep with your mouth open because it gives your jaws more room to move throughout the night. For those with jaw or jaw joint pain, because GODSUMM gently holds your jaw together and prevents you from sleeping with your mouth wide open, you can minimize the pain that occurs within this region. 
 
 

 

 
 


The lips are pressed together and the lower jaw is pulled up to close the mouth. As a result, the airways are widened which prevents snoring and allows you to sleep deeply. This simple act of keeping the jaw gently pressed together will also provide long term benefits mentioned above!


 

 

 

 



 
 



 
 



 
Mouth Breathers during sleep
For mouth breathers, as you’re sleeping, dust and germs combine together with the air in your mouth, which can pollute various organs and cells to ultimately weaken your immune system.

 

 
Nose Breathers during sleep
For nose breathers, there is a reduction in the influx of bacteria and viruses as you sleep and simultaneously protects the lungs through sterilizing, humidifying and dehumidifying functions. This will ultimately strengthen your immune system and helps to supply more oxygen throughout your body.



 



 
 


 
 

 
When breathing through the nose, the mucus and nose hairs initially filter out harmful substances from the air entering the nostrils. The aspirated air slowly escapes through the winding, narrow passage of the nose, helping the lungs extract a lot of oxygen. In addition, distorted airways are reopened, which prevents snoring and also strengthens the immune system.


 
 


 
 

 



 
 
 

 

 


 
I was able to sleep deeply after using this product! – Gabrielle Mosbe 




 
After my husband started using the GODSUMM I noticed a clear drop in his snoring levels. I definitely recommend this amazing product to everyone! – Kara M. 




 
Since I can use it right before I go to bed it wasn’t uncomfortable and after a short time I didn’t even notice I had it on. I ended up adjusting quickly and slept great! – Eliza Ogde. 




 
I finally realized why people said nasal breathing was beneficial to my health. After I woke up I felt energized and even realized that I had no morning breath! - Zack Williams

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>I am Layla aka ‘Acres Wild’ and live in a small village with my partner and infant in Herefordshire. </p>
<p>Through an interest in nature, self-sufficiency and the well being of our daughter I became interested in foraging, and through our inability to find affordable, natural skin care products I embarked on making my own.  </p>
<p>In these embryonic stages I am concentrating on getting my fully developed lip balms out into the market, the balms are created with wonderfully therapeutic wild plants including, plantain, cleavers, yarrow &amp; comfrey and to scent the balms, meadowsweet, linden blossom, rose, lavender and mint.  </p>
<p>The lovely thing is that you may well of happened upon many of these plants while walking in the beautiful English countryside, even if you don't recognise them yet! </p>
<p>We will not be limiting our range, in the future I fully intend to develop a number of wonderful products also created from foraged plants including a moisturising whip, facial scrub, nail oil and moustache wax for men folk. So do look out for us.</p>
<p>In keeping with our ethical theme all of the beeswax and honey included in the products is sourced from local hives where the bees feed on pollen from plants that have not been fed with chemicals or pesticides.</p>
<p>Our sustainable eco tubes are the only innovatively designed push up paper tubes on the market (not unlike popsicles, if you remember them!) and are recyclable or will decompose in your garden compost in 2 weeks. They also hold 6ml of balm as opposed to the average un-sustainable tube, which only holds 4.5ml, and are very tactile and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Upon receiving my full goal the funds will contribute towards the evolution of my product - notably for branding and finances towards the first compostable packing order, which is inherent to the ideals of Acres Wild.  Adding to this I will further develop distribution strategies and new product lines.  All of this will contribute to creating a sustainable future for our family.</p>
<p>Now to the perks, I know how much everyone loves a token of appreciation for contributing so we will create some fantastic gifts heaped full of love and thanks, these include luscious foraged lip balms, virtual hugs, moisturising whips and prints and originals of Acres Wild art (<a href=""http://acreswildblog.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://acreswildblog.wordpress.com/</a>) for all you lovely people that contribute to our campaign.</p>
<p>I hope you feel you can facilitate this ethical cottage industry; I cannot do it without you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Acres Wild's products are completely ecologically sound, there is absolutely nothing artificial in our whips, balms and oils, and also none of our products contain water, which increases the shelf life of chemical free products by at least 6 months.  </p>
<p>The foraged goods will be plucked responsibly (by experienced foragers) so there is no chance of depleting natural wild flora in the British Isles.  I use certified organic hemp seed oil from a farm in Devon, this super oil if applied regularly to the skin will improve dryness, eczema &amp; psoriasis, it is also reputed to reduce irritation caused by nappy rash, cradle cap and UV damage.</p>
<p>The shea &amp; cacao butters are wild-crafted/ certified organic and sourced from small fair-trade communities and the few essential oils used are sourced from small scale producers in the British Isles and are certified organic or grown without the use of pesticides and chemicals.</p>
<p>We intend to heighten and de mystify the public awareness of simply crafted, foraged, indigenous, and purely natural products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I am aware that not everyone is in the fortunate position contribute financially, however please tell your friends about Acres Wild, spread the word through facebook and twitter if possible, help me make this ethical venture a success.  </p>
