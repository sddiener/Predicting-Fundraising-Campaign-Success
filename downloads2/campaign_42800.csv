<p>REALM + WILD is a heart-centered venture fueled by a love for nature and the everlasting quest to find meaningful work. Sparked with a conscious spirit, the REALM + WILD business model was formulated to support a responsible and sustainable supply chain while splitting profits with Mother Nature herself. Our practice is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design product with the intention to inspire and inform</li>
<li>Produce product responsibly</li>
<li>Sell product to wonderful customers who will, in turn, spread the message</li>
<li>Tally up profits annually and contribute 50% to wildlife conservation</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To be clear, this is indeed a for profit endeavor in which wildlife ultimately has a 50% stake. Activities in which the $15,000 will support include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fulfillment of Indiegogo fees and backer rewards</li>
<li>Obtaining the necessary resources to produce creative and content for website and related marketing. Building a solid presentation that will get the brand noticed and the word out</li>
<li>Production of Spring 2016 product line</li>
</ul>
<p>If our goal of $15,000 is not met, 100% of collected contributions will still be allocated towards the above activities :)</p>

<h3>Thank you!</h3> <p>Your contribution to help REALM + WILD launch for Spring 2016 will go a huge way to getting us where we need to be to meet our commitment to wildlife conservation.

<p>Sadly, harmful production methods in the product supply chain often go unnoticed to the greater consumer market. We see the pretty end-product but not the cost it has had both socially and economically.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a growing trend in businesses and suppliers that are investing in better ways to produce and deliver product.

<p><b><i>INFORMING</i></b></p>
<p>Through strategic distribution , the goal is to not only inspire our audience with meaningful pieces, but to also share the importance of conservation. Whether it's a friendly smile of a rhinoceros or the concerned visage of a wolf, our pieces are designed to communicate the love and intelligence of all lifeforms of this planet. The commercial aspect of REALM + WILD is to not only support our business structure, but to also elevate awareness among our customers and their collective circles</p>
<p><b><i>SUPPORTING</i></b></p>
<p>The third facet of the REALM + WILD business model is to provide support to individuals and organizations that have dedicated their mission to wildlife conservation.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> The one risk REALM + WILD faces with meeting goals for the Spring 2016 launch would be a lack of funding for the anticipated production run.

The Impact The mission of REALM + WILD is to promote mindfulness in 3 key facets:

PARTNERING
Sadly, harmful production methods in the product supply chain often go unnoticed to the greater consumer market. We see the pretty end-product but not the cost it has had both socially and economically.
Luckily, there is a growing trend in businesses and suppliers that are investing in better ways to produce and deliver product.

Through sharing in and supporting each other's commitment to sustainable and responsible business practices, it is our goal to continue to raise the bar in how consumer goods are produced.
INFORMING
Through strategic distribution , the goal is to not only inspire our audience with meaningful pieces, but to also share the importance of conservation. Whether it's a friendly smile of a rhinoceros or the concerned visage of a wolf, our pieces are designed to communicate the love and intelligence of all lifeforms of this planet.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I am asking for $10,000 from MYWILLOWS supporters, which will enable me to do the following:</p>
<p><b>The Tradeshow.  </b></p>
<p>There are a few tradeshows that I will be applying to in the next month.  They all take place in Januaray/February.  This is where boutique and department store buyers come to purchase clothing and accessories for Spring/Summer 2016. </p>
<p>Being able to attend one of these shows would get the sunglasses in front of many buyers at one time.  It would allow me to take orders and have my product in stores around the US come March/April.  This will not only create brand awareness but a large order from a store such as Urban Outfitters could really put us on the map. </p>

<p><b>Production. </b></p>
<p>There are a few final details that I would like to add to MyWillows.  These pieces will brand the glasses and insure that we stand out.  I will meet with CAD drawers and mold casters Downtown Los Angeles in order to complete this project.  </p>
<p>If possible, I would like to get hard cases for the glasses (which have already been identified)  as well as branded sunglass wipes.  </p>

<br/>
<p><b>WeeWillows. </b></p>
<p>I would like to launch the WeWillows website and have the first collection up in the New Year.  Kids love MyWillows and they are always excited to try them on.  I believe a kids collection (especially for young girls that want their ears pierced but they are still too young) will be a huge hit since the sunglasses act as earrings as well.  </p>

<p>Donate a larger amount and get several pairs. Donate even more  and you get several MyWillows including a custom made pair that you can help design (if you wish) and have that style named after you. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal (but we will because you guys are awesome!) your contribution would go towards attending a Tradeshow or alternatively rent space in a showroom for the LA Market.  The latter is a less expensive option but not as impactful.  Any additional funds would be allocated towards product development. </p>

There are a few tradeshows that I will be applying to in the next month.  They all take place in Januaray/February.  This is where boutique and department store buyers come to purchase clothing and accessories for Spring/Summer 2016. 
Being able to attend one of these shows would get the sunglasses in front of many buyers at one time.  It would allow me to take orders and have my product in stores around the US come March/April.  This will not only create brand awareness but a large order from a store such as Urban Outfitters could really put us on the map. 


Production. 
There are a few final details that I would like to add to MyWillows.  These pieces will brand the glasses and insure that we stand out.  I will meet with CAD drawers and mold casters Downtown Los Angeles in order to complete this project.  
If possible, I would like to get hard cases for the glasses (which have already been identified)  as well as branded sunglass wipes.  



WeeWillows. 
I would like to launch the WeWillows website and have the first collection up in the New Year.  Kids love MyWillows and they are always excited to try them on.  I believe a kids collection (especially for young girls that want their ears pierced but they are still too young) will be a huge hit since the sunglasses act as earrings as well.  




Everyone that donates will get a pair of MyWillows!  Depending on the amount of the donation, you will either get Feather MyWillows,  Silver chain,  Gold chain or a MyWillows Necklace.  




The perk is that they will be at a discount from what they are priced on our website and with the Holidays around the corner, they make the perfect gift! 
Donate a larger amount and get several pairs. Donate even more  and you get several MyWillows including a custom made pair that you can help design (if you wish) and have that style named after you. 
If we don't reach our entire goal (but we will because you guys are awesome!) your contribution would go towards attending a Tradeshow or alternatively rent space in a showroom for the LA Market.  The latter is a less expensive option but not as impactful.  Any additional funds would be allocated towards product development. 

    Risks & Challenges
Manufacturing large quantities is my only foreseeable obstacle but I would figure that out very quickly. Los Angeles has a plethora of talent and the garment industry downtown is growing rapidly.  I have factors in place (factors act as gap financiers who will allow me to buy all of my materials once I have a purchase order) and am confident that I could work through this challenge with ease. 


Other Ways You Can Help


If you can't help by purchasing a pair of MyWillows, please spread the word!  Posting on your social media sites and telling all of your friends so that this campaign can spread, would be very much appreciated!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

    The Impact 
The mission at MyGolfShirts.com is to develop the brand and the style of golf apparel that will look good, feel good but also help the golfer to play well. All golf apparels are specifically designed for the activity. A golf game may take hours, and each player has to walk through the course quite often. In such situation, golf shirts play major role in determining whether or not you are always in perfect comfort to do every swing without distraction from any physical discomfort. MyGolfShirts.com wants to lead the industry in this important endevour.

MyGolfShirts began the business based on an understanding that golf apparels should be designed to serve two important purposes. First, golf shirts should offer maximum flexibility to allow every player’s possible movement required for the game. Second, a shirt is always an inseparable part of fashion a statement, so it has to be as stylish as it can be without affecting the quality of your swings. Therefore, good golf shirts allow you to perform at your full potential without sacrificing the importance of comfort and fashion.
MyGolfShirts.com brings you a standard fit to make sure you get enough flexibility and enough room for all the swings instead of the more restricting slim fit design. All shirts provided are made from lightweight material offering breathability as well as effective sweat absorption, which are important when you are exposed under hot weather continuously during the game. However they also design certain types of golf shirts to keep you warm during cooler weather. The dedicated staff at MyGolfShirts.com are continuously working with experienced professional golfers to get a better understanding of the ultimate golf shirts for all, and combine it with French­designing expertise to make a perfect blend between sport, comfort, and style.

There are tons of perks at different dollar amounts for you to choose from. All perks and gifts will be sent as soon as the campaign has ended. If my goal has not been reached by the end of the campaign I plan to use the money to further grow my business.

Also, keep in mind that if I reach my goal I plan to donate 15% of the sales made from Euphoria Fest to Girls Empowerment Network of Austin.  Check out their website here.  

The Impact

Just wanted to let y'all know how your investment will truly benefit a small local business.  After a year of applying to be a vendor at music festivals and denial after denial, I have finally reached the point in by business where I am not only being accepted to vend but capable of providing the inventory and preparation it takes to have a weekend popup shop. Your contribution will help put my brand in front of thousands people. That amount of exposure will boost my small online, business into a thriving and empowered store. Your contribution will also go toward supporting and sustaining a small, American made business. With the rise in fast fashion and sweatshop labor, much of the clothing we wear everyday has a hidden truth that many times goes unseen. You can guarantee that every Royal Dyeness garment will be made by my own two hands.     Risks & Challenges
Since you are considering investing in my business, I want to be completely transparent.
Being a one women show, creating enough inventory to have a successful shop will not prove to be an easy task. Nonetheless, I have the education, experience and practice to make enough inventory to more than just succeed, but to thrive. After all, every piece was designed by me for you! I know the in's and out's of every garment like the back of my hand.   Other Ways You Can Help If you can't provide a financial contribution but still want to help, here are some was to do it:  Share this campaign on your social media accounts! It will really help get the word out about Royal Dyeness Follow me on social media! @royaldyeness on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>The magnetic suspender belt excited the art, performer and model communities. </b></p>
<p><b>Helen Kitajewski, Finalist of Miss British Curve 2016 and Miss Pembrokeshire Curve 2016</b>:‘’This product is unique and innovative - I can't wait to get my hands on the product itself! This new suspender belt also looks fabulous, in a range of sexy colours’’.</p>

I and my colleagues think that this will change the burlesque world as we won't have to worry about the damage to our tights from the metal or plastic hooks that are used in the current suspenders.

<p><b>Why did we go magnetic?</b></p>
<p>For the past century women all over the world have had to put up with the hideous way a suspender belt attaches to stockings – it was difficult, time-consuming, not comfortable and worse – not always worked. We too, experienced stockings being detached from the suspender belt and the embarrassment of having them rolled down right to the ankles while trying to hide from the onlookers.</p>
<p>We changed that. We developed a suspender belt which attaches to the stockings – any type of stockings - via magnetic clip. It is easy, fast, safe and comfortable – we tried it, it takes just one second to attach a clip to the stockings. Long will be gone times when women were trying for 10 minutes to attach stockings to the suspender, bending and twisting their back, arms, hips in hideous ways, sweating with their hair dangling all over their face, rushing to get these two pieces attached together, and often completely resigning from this task! It wasn’t not only not practical but also it didn’t look the best during a hot date! It takes just a few seconds to attach our magnetic suspender belt to the stockings and be ready to go. It couldn’t be simpler.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469525577/Tantalising_Elegance_Red_belt_Ella_Vine_use_gdngrc.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 158.004px;height: 184px;""/></p><br/>
<p>Our magnetic suspender belt, which is patent pending, will revolutionise the lingerie industry – it is developed by women for women. Join our campaign to be a part of this marvellous movement - when women say ‘’no’’ to the uncomfortable, hideous ways the lingerie industry tell us how to wear our suspenders and where women take this into their own hands. The product’s inventor, Ella, was struggling for years with the way her medical stockings had to be attached to a suspender belt – to the point that she has given up altogether. But then a moment of eureka, of empowerment came – Ella talked to her friends and other women and all screamed in excitement on the thought that the process of attaching the stockings to a suspender belt can be made so simple.</p>
<p>And here we go, Ella developed the innovative product over the course of a year, making many prototypes, finally inventing the <i>NeoMagTriple™</i> technology, trying it on in various situations, even dancing a can-can in this suspender belt – all to ensure that modern women will have modern lingerie pieces that will meet all their needs – including the need to put on their lingerie quickly and the need to feel comfortable.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469525631/FB_cover_Ella_private_profile_k3cnnq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

By supporting this project and investing in the business (choose one or more perks on the right side of the screen) you will help the exciting and innovative Ella Vine lingerie brand off the ground! 2% of all funds raised via crowdfunding will be donated by Ella to Women’s Aid charity. Let’s get pledging!Recommendations: Jack Levene, former Head of Lingerie at Marks & Spencer UK: ‘’The magnetic fastening on this Suspender Belt will be a great boon to both the user and to their partners. This is the first innovation in years, it speeds up production and makes it far easier for the user when attaching or removing from Stockings’’.
The magnetic suspender belt excited the art, performer and model communities. 
Helen Kitajewski, Finalist of Miss British Curve 2016 and Miss Pembrokeshire Curve 2016:‘’This product is unique and innovative - I can't wait to get my hands on the product itself! This new suspender belt also looks fabulous, in a range of sexy colours’’.
Khandie Khisses, one of UK’s top 20 burlesque performers: ‘’In burlesque you are always looking for new and novel ways to help with the tease of your performance, this marvel from Ella Vine lingerie has provided an ingenious way to help us. In our day to day stocking wearing, who doesn’t love a garment that makes it easier to be a sassy hosiery wearer?!’’
Lady Blue Phoenix, a burlesque dancer: ‘’I can't wait for it to come out! I and my colleagues think that this will change the burlesque world as we won't have to worry about the damage to our tights from the metal or plastic hooks that are used in the current suspenders. It will open up a door to wear different stockings and we will know they are more secure and will stay in place’’.
Why did we go magnetic?
For the past century women all over the world have had to put up with the hideous way a suspender belt attaches to stockings – it was difficult, time-consuming, not comfortable and worse – not always worked. We too, experienced stockings being detached from the suspender belt and the embarrassment of having them rolled down right to the ankles while trying to hide from the onlookers.
We changed that. We developed a suspender belt which attaches to the stockings – any type of stockings - via magnetic clip. It is easy, fast, safe and comfortable – we tried it, it takes just one second to attach a clip to the stockings. Long will be gone times when women were trying for 10 minutes to attach stockings to the suspender, bending and twisting their back, arms, hips in hideous ways, sweating with their hair dangling all over their face, rushing to get these two pieces attached together, and often completely resigning from this task! It wasn’t not only not practical but also it didn’t look the best during a hot date! It takes just a few seconds to attach our magnetic suspender belt to the stockings and be ready to go. It couldn’t be simpler.
Our magnetic suspender belt, which is patent pending, will revolutionise the lingerie industry – it is developed by women for women. Join our campaign to be a part of this marvellous movement - when women say ‘’no’’ to the uncomfortable, hideous ways the lingerie industry tell us how to wear our suspenders and where women take this into their own hands. The product’s inventor, Ella, was struggling for years with the way her medical stockings had to be attached to a suspender belt – to the point that she has given up altogether. But then a moment of eureka, of empowerment came – Ella talked to her friends and other women and all screamed in excitement on the thought that the process of attaching the stockings to a suspender belt can be made so simple.
And here we go, Ella developed the innovative product over the course of a year, making many prototypes, finally inventing the NeoMagTriple™ technology, trying it on in various situations, even dancing a can-can in this suspender belt – all to ensure that modern women will have modern lingerie pieces that will meet all their needs – including the need to put on their lingerie quickly and the need to feel comfortable.
It is more than a brand – it is an extraordinary movement of women’s empowerment! 
Join this fantastic movement of women empowerment, where women say no to the uncomfortable products developed by lingerie giants and where they develop and support the products that will work for them. Pre-order this wonderful suspender belt now to receive it 3 months after this campaign will end! By participating you will help Ella manufacture this product and market it to make it mainstream.
Don’t wait, we have only 7 weeks to make this a reality, to make a history – women revolutionising the lingerie their wear, women owning the way they wear it.

What we will do with the money raised
We will be able to produce the magnetic suspender belts in various types, shapes, colours and sizes; we will also be able to set up an e-shop and start selling our gorgeous products to the world! Apart from the fabulous magnetic suspender belts we will be selling all kinds of gorgeous luxury lingerie products from knickers to bras, from corsets to camis and everything in between! And make no mistake, the magnetic suspender belt is not the only innovative – first of this type - lingerie product that Ella will produce - she already has her sight on more innovative products.
Here is a breakdown of what we will do with the money if we will reach our £17,500 target:
£12,000 – the cost of making and shipping the pre-ordered magnetic suspender belts to our crowdfunders; this includes the 5% crowdfunding fee, 3% paypal fees, 2% donation to Women’s Aid, tax, labels, packaging, etc.
we will be able to purchase £4,000 worth of stock, materials and produce the first product range,
another £2,000 we will enable us to create a stunning and easy to navigate website

<h3>Why Lineage?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501185101/vsp3av4rtyan9v6rfcuw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Since 2014, Lineage has been one of the leaders in the curvy-fit athletic apparel industry. We believe in vibrant, colorful activewear that is also ethical, sustainable, and inclusive. Our unique fit was developed using concepts learned in Broadway costuming. No camel toe, no muffin top! The name Lineage stems from the concept in both sewing and yoga of knowledge being handed down orally from teacher to student.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501001939/um4awbrqhvvdaladzbqz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our customers have been asking for booty shorts for AGES! (These are shorter that our regular <a data-external=""true"" href=""https://lineagewear.com/products/shorties-beta-test"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peacock Shorties</a>.) We've finally developed and tested a fit that we love! Our goal is to produce 14 prints, in sizes small-4X. Our production costs for this are estimated to be $5000.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501009246/u54ziplendvnu1qwess6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>New Leggings- Our goal is to release 18 new prints, in sizes small-5X. Our production costs for this are estimated to be $27,000.</p>
<p>Both shorts and leggings will be built using lightweight, ""squat proof"" poly spandex. Our fabric is printed on both sides to ensure that nothing is hanging out in downward dog. This fabric is moisture wicking, and ideal for high impact activities that require a second skin fit. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501002164/svgn1tamsylacdngirdq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Size Chart- Lengths are listed unstretched. When worn, they will stretch.</i></p>
<p>What do you get out of this? First crack at our new gear, at sale prices. This year's perks are all priced lower than last year! Our limited edition Flirty Mermaid perk won't be available anywhere else. And FREE worldwide shipping on all perks over $125, same as our store. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Lineage is a self-funded company.  Our biggest issue is keeping up with demand! Crowdfunding campaigns help us stay ahead of demand, release new prints and products, and help us keep classic designs in stock. In addition to last year's successful Indiegogo campaign, we've run two other successful pre-order campaigns. Support a small, woman owned business- see why thousands of people are wearing the #bestleggingsever!</p>
<h3>Our Philosophy- Ethical, Sustainable, &amp; Inclusive.</h3>
<p><strong>Ethical </strong></p>
<p>Our leggings are handmade in New York City's renowned Fashion District. The employees at our shops are paid a living wage, work realistic hours, and are given frequent breaks and holidays. We believe it is vital to the local economy to build our stuff in a fair, sustainable way, not using child or slave labor. Therefore, we will never build overseas. The unfortunate side effect in this is that production is a little slower, and costs are higher- but we feel like it's worth it. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501006127/xdu6bprjgfrmlex4qhlx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Sustainable</strong></p>
<p>Our fabrics are printed using sublimation techniques. </p>
<p>Sublimation Printing is a process in which designs are transferred from pre-printed paper onto fabric by contact heat, of which the dyes are absorbed by the fabric. It is great way to produce high clarity, well defined designs. The pre-printed paper is an advantageous way to store patterns with the flexibility of being able to print on any synthetic fabrication when needed, rather than having to hold inventory on only one printed fabric. This allows for more flexibility and diversity in choosing fabric styles.</p>
<p>Sublimation printing (heat transfer printing) has always been a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly process than dyeing fabrics. Whether it be single or double-sided printing, sublimation uses less water and less energy to “color” a fabric, without emitting hazardous gases into the air.</p>
<p>Our printing facility is further committed to sustainability in a number of ways:</p>
<p>Using water-based inks in our pigment printing operation with no solvents added (which emit harmful VOCs)</p>
<p>Operating an in-house waste water treatment system that cleans and filters our water to remove dye particles</p>
<p>Recycling our exhausted transfer paper to other markets</p>
<p>Collecting our waste fabric to be recycled to other markets</p>
<p>Every step of the process is American made, with an emphasis on a small carbon footprint. Our shops are family owned and operated. Our tags, labels, and packaging are all sourced using American companies. Our mailers are made from 88% recycled materials, and are recyclable. </p>
<p><strong>Inclusive</strong></p>
<p>Lineagewear is a body positive company.</p>
<p>We don't add surcharges to larger sizes.</p>
<p>We don't have separate sections for ""straight"" and ""plus"" sizes.</p>
<p>Body shaming is not our bag.</p>
<p>All bodies are gorgeous, and all bodies are to be celebrated for their unique abilities.</p>
<p>We practice radical self love.</p>
<p>We want every woman, no matter where they are on their fitness journey, to feel OHMazing in Lineagewear. </p>
<p>Lineagewear doesn't believe in ""one size fits all"". People are all shapes and sizes, clothing companies skew their size charts differently, and the BMI chart doesn't take into account things like height, fitness, or muscle tone. A hundred years ago, almost every piece of clothing you owned would have been tailor made to your specific measurements. That's the type of fit we strive for with our leggings. We want our garments to fit true to size every time. </p>
<p>Please, don't ever feel that there is something weird or wrong with YOUR body just because a garment doesn't fit. YOU are perfect, YOU are beautiful!  </p>
<p><strong>Giving Back</strong> </p>
<p>We believe it's our responsibility to give back to our community. To date, we have raised over $31,000 for various charities such as Bend to Mend, NEDA, Project Fit America, Team For Kids, and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. </p>
<h3>How To Order</h3>
<p>Simply select the perk you're interested in, and check out. You will receive a backers survey shortly after the end of the campaign where you can indicate your size, length, and print preferences. (Pics of our new designs can be found under the ""Gallery"" tab.)</p>

</div></div>","Why Lineage?

Since 2014, Lineage has been one of the leaders in the curvy-fit athletic apparel industry. We believe in vibrant, colorful activewear that is also ethical, sustainable, and inclusive. Our unique fit was developed using concepts learned in Broadway costuming. No camel toe, no muffin top! The name Lineage stems from the concept in both sewing and yoga of knowledge being handed down orally from teacher to student.

Our leggings have been featured all over the place, most recently in Yoga Journal. Check out our Press page!


What We Need & What You Get
Our customers have been asking for booty shorts for AGES! (These are shorter that our regular Peacock Shorties.) We've finally developed and tested a fit that we love! Our goal is to produce 14 prints, in sizes small-4X. Our production costs for this are estimated to be $5000.


New Leggings- Our goal is to release 18 new prints, in sizes small-5X. Our production costs for this are estimated to be $27,000.
Both shorts and leggings will be built using lightweight, ""squat proof"" poly spandex. Our fabric is printed on both sides to ensure that nothing is hanging out in downward dog. This fabric is moisture wicking, and ideal for high impact activities that require a second skin fit. 

Size Chart- Lengths are listed unstretched. When worn, they will stretch.
What do you get out of this? First crack at our new gear, at sale prices. This year's perks are all priced lower than last year! Our limited edition Flirty Mermaid perk won't be available anywhere else. And FREE worldwide shipping on all perks over $125, same as our store. 

The Impact
Lineage is a self-funded company.  Our biggest issue is keeping up with demand! Crowdfunding campaigns help us stay ahead of demand, release new prints and products, and help us keep classic designs in stock. In addition to last year's successful Indiegogo campaign, we've run two other successful pre-order campaigns. Support a small, woman owned business- see why thousands of people are wearing the #bestleggingsever!
Our Philosophy- Ethical, Sustainable, & Inclusive.
Ethical 
Our leggings are handmade in New York City's renowned Fashion District. The employees at our shops are paid a living wage, work realistic hours, and are given frequent breaks and holidays. We believe it is vital to the local economy to build our stuff in a fair, sustainable way, not using child or slave labor. Therefore, we will never build overseas. The unfortunate side effect in this is that production is a little slower, and costs are higher- but we feel like it's worth it. 

Sustainable
Our fabrics are printed using sublimation techniques. 
Sublimation Printing is a process in which designs are transferred from pre-printed paper onto fabric by contact heat, of which the dyes are absorbed by the fabric. It is great way to produce high clarity, well defined designs. The pre-printed paper is an advantageous way to store patterns with the flexibility of being able to print on any synthetic fabrication when needed, rather than having to hold inventory on only one printed fabric. This allows for more flexibility and diversity in choosing fabric styles.
Sublimation printing (heat transfer printing) has always been a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly process than dyeing fabrics. Whether it be single or double-sided printing, sublimation uses less water and less energy to “color” a fabric, without emitting hazardous gases into the air.
Our printing facility is further committed to sustainability in a number of ways:
Using water-based inks in our pigment printing operation with no solvents added (which emit harmful VOCs)
Operating an in-house waste water treatment system that cleans and filters our water to remove dye particles
Recycling our exhausted transfer paper to other markets
Collecting our waste fabric to be recycled to other markets
Every step of the process is American made, with an emphasis on a small carbon footprint. Our shops are family owned and operated. Our tags, labels, and packaging are all sourced using American companies. Our mailers are made from 88% recycled materials, and are recyclable. 
Inclusive
Lineagewear is a body positive company.
We don't add surcharges to larger sizes.
We don't have separate sections for ""straight"" and ""plus"" sizes.
Body shaming is not our bag.
All bodies are gorgeous, and all bodies are to be celebrated for their unique abilities.
We practice radical self love.
We want every woman, no matter where they are on their fitness journey, to feel OHMazing in Lineagewear. 
Lineagewear doesn't believe in ""one size fits all"". People are all shapes and sizes, clothing companies skew their size charts differently, and the BMI chart doesn't take into account things like height, fitness, or muscle tone. A hundred years ago, almost every piece of clothing you owned would have been tailor made to your specific measurements. That's the type of fit we strive for with our leggings. We want our garments to fit true to size every time. 
Please, don't ever feel that there is something weird or wrong with YOUR body just because a garment doesn't fit. YOU are perfect, YOU are beautiful!  
Giving Back 
We believe it's our responsibility to give back to our community. To date, we have raised over $31,000 for various charities such as Bend to Mend, NEDA, Project Fit America, Team For Kids, and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. 
How To Order
Simply select the perk you're interested in, and check out. You will receive a backers survey shortly after the end of the campaign where you can indicate your size, length, and print preferences. (Pics of our new designs can be found under the ""Gallery"" tab.)
Budget constraints? You can split a perk with a friend and order two different sizes. 
Change your mind? You can return or exchange a perk after the campaign is over.
Can't get enough? You can add additional perks during the backers survey. 
Remember, all perks over $125 ship free, just like in our store!
Stretch Goal!
""That all sounds great, but what I really want is one of the sold out products from your website!""
Hey, we totally understand that. The more we raise, the more we can restock. If you can get us to our goal of $32,000, we will open up perks to include our existing line of adult leggings- such as our must-have Not So Basic Black leggings, or our Blue Peacock leggings. We even have Maternity Leggings!  (Kids leggings not included in this goal, sorry.)

<p>I'm Anna, a relatively new Norse Pagan. I cherish and love my gods, and I am upset that white supremacists (or whatever else they might call themselves) continue to use the sacred symbols of Norse Paganism alongside symbols of bigotry and hatred.</p>
<p>I'm setting up this campaign in hopes of challenging the notion that the Norse Gods are anything but ethnically diverse, just as those who worshiped them centuries ago were. These pins portray the gods in a variety of skin tones and races -- future campaigns, should this one be successful, will broaden the diversity to include gender and body type. The hope is to advance the idea that the Norse Gods are representative of those who worship them.</p>
<p>By backing this project and wearing or displaying these pins, you will help challenge the idea that Norse Pagans are all bigots and racists, and instead represent the growing portion of Norse Pagans who are accepting and loving of all.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The largest portion of the funding is needed for the manufacturing of the pins themselves. I will be going through Zap! Creatives in the UK to get the pins made. I've already worked with them to produce Loki, and their pins are of excellent quality. The rest of the funding will cover packaging supplies and shipping costs.</p>
<p>Each pin will be approximately 25mm tall (about 1 inch) and have one rubber backing. Made of hard enamel and gold or silver plating, these pins will be sturdy and durable!</p>
<p>If by chance the total funding goal is not met, the funds will go towards the production of the most popular pin designs. For those who ordered a pin that is less popular and therefore not made, you will be able to select one of the designs that does get made. Right now, Thor is the first in line for production, with Njord and Freyja following after.</p>
<p>If more than the needed funding is met, I will add more to the series, including Frigga, Sigyn, Skadi, and a few other divine ladies.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge this project faces is getting the required funding to produce all of the pin designs available. Between my social media presence and my own tenacity, I have high hopes that I will be able to make the goal in the required amount of time. Depending on the end funding amount, I am also prepared to put forth some of my own money, out of pocket, to meet the end goal.</p>

That's where we come in.  Waiting sucks . Tap the banner above to choose from the first 24 Nitro Musks and have them shipped today.  Use code ""First24"" for 33% off. Ends 11/26  Employing equal parts nifty science, big brains, and tireless hustle we’ve revolutionized men’s fragrances by creating pure oil cologne we call Nitro Musk. We craft Nitro Musk using the finest ingredients on earth. The exact same grade of raw materials, the same origin and composition of essential oils, and the same unique, exotic, and expensive specialty raw materials as more expensive and less concentrated designer spray colognes.Here are just a few of the fine ingredients we include in these three new Nitro Musks. If we let you in on the rest we'd have to kill you. Nobody wants that, so we'll just go ahead and keep the rest to ourselves.   The mixture of apples, vanilla, and mint are simply glorious in #98, our version of Versace Eros.  Ever tried smelling just a little bit like basil? We didn't think so. You should, it's awesome. Mandarin orange, peppercorn, and juniper are just some of the stones along the path to smelling like you were just dipped in the essence of summertime.     Your brand new , glistening Nitro Stubbies will be oh so comfy nestled in our individually hand packed and labeled, heroic, and compact vessels. Get in line for one today and change your life forever.    We launched our first 24 Nitro Musks on Kickstarter one year ago and people sure had some nice things to say. Take a look below to see the glorious-ness of Nitro Musk described in spectacularly eloquent detail. We've just completed our second successful campaign on Kickstarter. Check it out HERE.    Nitro Musk looks especially good on a marble counter top next to old fashioned looking soap in a glass bottle. Will the soap clean better with Nitro Musk nearby? Back us today and find out for yourself.​​  The next 24 in our lineup kick ass. Keep an eye on our updates for more information on many of these fragrances as well as opportunities to try them out for yourself, for free, before our campaign ends. Want to know more about each of these new Nitro Musks?

You can carry 24 different Nitro Musks, good for 3 to 6 months worth of wear, and take up less room in your luggage than a single can of soup. And if you carry soup with you when you travel, stop. That's weird.  Majestic. Rugged. Stubbies.  See what all the fuss is about before the campaign ends.  Tap the image above and order Original Nitro Musk today.  Code ""First 24"" for 33% off.

To this end, I consulted with Trevor Bysouth, a Funeral Director and community educator on death and dying who felt that the show is an innovative tool to; “create community awareness of death, grieving, funerals and associated issues”; and that “respectful humour plays a big part in the education process, and indeed the funeral itself.” The sadness must be endured, but it need not be in isolation nor without celebration.</p><p>I recently had a fascinating tour of FECRI to look at blood cells through a microscope.

Bringing death to life by creating a cultural shift in the way we grieve that makes our inevitable end accessible and acceptable.My name is Kat Pengelly; I am an artist and fashion designer establishing the label KOSHKA Art Fuelled Fashion. I have an inclination to create fashion concept shows. Fashion for Funerals - Putting the FUN into Funerals was born of my mother's death. Devastated, I turned to my craft for catharsis.Have you noticed there is a ‘death positive’ movement permeating the zeitgeist? It’s ok to talk about death. In fact, embark on a conversation down that once dark corridor and you may find that people’s eyes light up with interest and curiosity.  Fashion for Funerals – Putting the FUN into Funerals where arts, psychology and science collide with the central theme of death. It is a story telling platform for writers, film and theatre makers, fashion designers, artists, musicians, psychologists and scientists. The show premiered at the Nati (Natimuk) Frinj Biennale to audience acclaim in *2015. This was made possible through a grant received from the Regional Arts Fund administered by Regional Arts Victoria.Part of the initial planning in 2015 included discussions with the Fiona Elsey Cancer Research Institute (FECRI) in Ballarat. I turned to this organisation because mum died from cancer. I was looking for understanding and answers. My support of FECRI is in loving  memory of my mum and with the belief that our scientists will find a cure.                        I am mindful of the potential that the title has to offend by mentioning ‘fun’ in context with the grief stricken experience that funerals can be. To this end, I consulted with Trevor Bysouth, a Funeral Director and community educator on death and dying who felt that the show is an innovative tool to; “create community awareness of death, grieving, funerals and associated issues”; and that “respectful humour plays a big part in the education process, and indeed the funeral itself.” The sadness must be endured, but it need not be in isolation nor without celebration.I recently had a fascinating tour of FECRI to look at blood cells through a microscope. There is a ‘Blood Cell Section’ in the show that investigates how “a miniscule change in a microscopic something can be the difference between life and death”.  (1) Blood Cell Fabric Design - Louisa West StudioThe group of blood cells pictured above were selected from the lab with the intention of printing them onto fabric to create a new collection. We have kept the natural characteristics of the blood cells which are quite beautiful. They have been enlarged and colour heightened for artistic representation.  The magnified blood cells remind me of gem-like  pomegranate seeds. I decided on using healthy blood cells for the fabric print as I'm a tad superstitious!Also established in 2015 was a partnership with the Art Gallery of Ballarat. Fashion for Funerals – Putting the FUN into Funerals has been included in their major exhibition ‘Romancing the Skull’. The Art Gallery of Ballarat will market our event and have also provided seed funding.                                                     Best of Ballarat-The best little Tourist mag in town featuring an artwork in Romancing the Skull 14 OCT - 28 JAN Art Gallery of BallaratArt credit: Josè Guadalupe Posada Calaverita Gomista (detail)(Little Calavera of General Gomez) circa 1910, relief etching on woven paper.

It is my intention to pay my creative collaborators equitable fees which are too often overlooked. The project will create employment and professional development opportunities for many regional artists and also raise money and awareness for cancer research and early detection.Why we need YOUr help - What the $ will doAn ideal budget for a show of this scale would be in the vicinity of $100,000 to do the job at hand without stressing about money.

<p>Superheroes aren't real, we know this. However, the values they instill in us and the perspectives they provide are very real. Beloved characters and the specific attributes we take from them are often what we wish to see in ourselves, and what we can aspire to. We use attributes of these characters in our everyday lives; the intelligence, readiness, strength, determination, drive, and dedication; when we use these we become our own hero. Our own Urban Hero.</p>
<p>Your Urban Hero takes visual elements of your favorite characters from pop culture and mutates them into trendy and fashionable ‘geek couture’. Selecting characters and concepts from anime, comic books, film, and television allows us the freedom to design great sneakers and apparel so ANYONE can represent the character of their choosing.

<p>Hello, my name is Judi Weisbart. I am a mother, grandmother and the designer of the Egg Necklace. I saw this image when sitting in a Peace Circle with Israeli &amp; Palestinian women at the Global Women’s Peace Initiative in Geneva in 2002. The egg was a Russian egg that we handed around in order to keep the conversation moving and only the holder of the object could speak. When it was placed in my hand I had a vision of the earth emerging from it. And so I created the necklace for our planet at this moment in our ‘his-tory’, or should I say ‘her-story.’ The time has come for The Birth of Reason. This is the time and we are the women! As our world reels from social shifts, political divisions, environmental disasters, economic insecurity and fear based leadership, we need a new paradigm of unity.</p>

<p>My overall goal is to spread this symbol around the world in order to help women come together and create global change through peace, harmony, understanding, strength and liberty. I foresee this necklace instilling a sense of global belonging and empowerment to women of all races, religions, and ages and inspiring healthy dialogue about the important issues we are facing. The Egg Necklace will be a catalyst for a movement of change – our planet desperately needs the infinite wisdom of women to unify, to rise up and nurture our earth and our people. We are all human beings on one small planet in a universe of infinite energy. Let us use the energy for peace. We can only evolve if we do it with love.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>This campaign culminates in February, directly following the United States Presidential Inauguration and also the Women’s March on Washington,Los Angeles and throughout the world. My team shared information about the Birth of Reason Egg Necklace at the marches! Over 3 million Americans spoke out on Saturday January 21, 2017, if you were one thank you and please join us now.  It is my deepest wish to have The Egg Necklace worn by as many women as possible. Our hope is that all of our backers will receive their necklaces by International Women's Day, March 8, 2017.  The more we raise, the better chance that this necklace will have a significant impact! Please support this cause, wear The Egg Necklace proudly, and share this idea with your friends. We also want to invite all who believe in this vision, including the men who stand by women and mother earth thru this difficult time. </p>

<p align=""center""><i>""Honor your daughters. They are honorable."" - Malala Yousafzai</i></p>
<p>The conception of this necklace was at the Global Women’s Peace Initiative of 2002. I was so inspired by my experience that I came home to create The Birth of Reason Egg Necklace. After producing a mold and finding the right manufacturer, I distributed a number of them in 2003. Although years have gone by since this initial circulation, I know many women who still wear these symbols and hold them close to their hearts, especially in this time of uncertainty and political upheaval.</p>
<p>The Egg Necklace is worn by women all over the world to remind them that they are the co-creators of this earth, and that the eggs they carry are the worlds to come. This symbol has been worn by hundreds of amazing women including: Linda Gray, Eve Ensler, Susan Sarandon, Sister Helen Prejuean, Sara Miller McCune, Patty DeDominic, Anita Roddick, Jane Goodall, Betty Hatch, Zainab Salbi, Mae Chee Sansanee, Elisabet Satourius, Barbara Marx Hubbard, Nancy Pelosi, Diane Meyer Simon, Julianna Friedman to name just a few... add your name to this list of remarkable women who have a sisterhood of co-creation.</p>

<p>Although any contribution will be much appreciated, I hope you will buy a necklace and wear it proudly! If you can go one step further and help spread this symbol around the world by choosing one of the higher perk levels, that would be truly amazing.</p>
<p>Sending a necklace to an influential woman will have more of an impact than you can imagine! If you choose to do this, we will ship a necklace to a woman of influence, such as senators and congresswomen, heads of non-profits, community leaders, etc. (e.g. women who are well positioned to make a difference).</p>
<p>Even if you can’t contribute monetarily, please do share this campaign with your friends and social network in order to spread the word.</p>
<p>The different levels of perks allow you to choose the extent of your impact on this movement. Each necklace comes in a gift bag with inspiring words and poem. It is made of high quality nickel with silver plate and can be ordered in either all silver or silver egg with gold Earth.</p>

<p align=""center""><strong>Why I am Confident that I can Make a Difference!</strong></p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>My work is for social justice, peace, compassion and beauty, this is the focus of my life’s work. In all my artwork, the purpose is to help create a better world.  My art is a powerful avenue for communicating these values.</p>
<p>Sacred art pieces speak to the traditions and connections to those who came before us, while imparting the history to those who came after.  I create sacred pieces that speak to many different religions and their traditions. To me the expression of art is a language that allows the viewer to feel and understand the artist emotionally. The voice inside me is loud, it yells at me to make a difference, speak out, be the change I want to see. Through the process of my work I try to communicate this voice.

Hello, my name is Judi Weisbart. I am a mother, grandmother and the designer of the Egg Necklace. I saw this image when sitting in a Peace Circle with Israeli & Palestinian women at the Global Women’s Peace Initiative in Geneva in 2002. The egg was a Russian egg that we handed around in order to keep the conversation moving and only the holder of the object could speak. When it was placed in my hand I had a vision of the earth emerging from it. And so I created the necklace for our planet at this moment in our ‘his-tory’, or should I say ‘her-story.’ The time has come for The Birth of Reason. This is the time and we are the women! As our world reels from social shifts, political divisions, environmental disasters, economic insecurity and fear based leadership, we need a new paradigm of unity.

Women of Peace: A Movement to Save the World
“The Future of this planet depends on women” – H.E.Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations
My overall goal is to spread this symbol around the world in order to help women come together and create global change through peace, harmony, understanding, strength and liberty. I foresee this necklace instilling a sense of global belonging and empowerment to women of all races, religions, and ages and inspiring healthy dialogue about the important issues we are facing. The Egg Necklace will be a catalyst for a movement of change – our planet desperately needs the infinite wisdom of women to unify, to rise up and nurture our earth and our people. We are all human beings on one small planet in a universe of infinite energy. Let us use the energy for peace. We can only evolve if we do it with love.
This Campaign
""Wherever men and women are persecuted because of their race, religion, or political views, that place must - at that moment - become the center of the universe."" - Elie Wiesel
I am hoping to raise the money to produce 1000 of these necklaces in order to begin the movement! Any money made from this campaign (either below or exceeding my goal) will be used to further the production and distribution of The Egg Necklace and all that it represents. I will not rest!
 
This campaign culminates in February, directly following the United States Presidential Inauguration and also the Women’s March on Washington,Los Angeles and throughout the world. My team shared information about the Birth of Reason Egg Necklace at the marches! Over 3 million Americans spoke out on Saturday January 21, 2017, if you were one thank you and please join us now.  It is my deepest wish to have The Egg Necklace worn by as many women as possible. Our hope is that all of our backers will receive their necklaces by International Women's Day, March 8, 2017.  The more we raise, the better chance that this necklace will have a significant impact! Please support this cause, wear The Egg Necklace proudly, and share this idea with your friends. We also want to invite all who believe in this vision, including the men who stand by women and mother earth thru this difficult time. 
 
History of The Egg Necklace
""Honor your daughters. They are honorable."" - Malala Yousafzai
The conception of this necklace was at the Global Women’s Peace Initiative of 2002. I was so inspired by my experience that I came home to create The Birth of Reason Egg Necklace. After producing a mold and finding the right manufacturer, I distributed a number of them in 2003. Although years have gone by since this initial circulation, I know many women who still wear these symbols and hold them close to their hearts, especially in this time of uncertainty and political upheaval.
The Egg Necklace is worn by women all over the world to remind them that they are the co-creators of this earth, and that the eggs they carry are the worlds to come. This symbol has been worn by hundreds of amazing women including: Linda Gray, Eve Ensler, Susan Sarandon, Sister Helen Prejuean, Sara Miller McCune, Patty DeDominic, Anita Roddick, Jane Goodall, Betty Hatch, Zainab Salbi, Mae Chee Sansanee, Elisabet Satourius, Barbara Marx Hubbard, Nancy Pelosi, Diane Meyer Simon, Julianna Friedman to name just a few... add your name to this list of remarkable women who have a sisterhood of co-creation.
 
Ways to Contribute and Perks
“A woman is like a teabag – you can’t tell how strong she is until you put her in hot water.” – Eleanor Roosevelt
 
Although any contribution will be much appreciated, I hope you will buy a necklace and wear it proudly! If you can go one step further and help spread this symbol around the world by choosing one of the higher perk levels, that would be truly amazing.
Sending a necklace to an influential woman will have more of an impact than you can imagine! If you choose to do this, we will ship a necklace to a woman of influence, such as senators and congresswomen, heads of non-profits, community leaders, etc. (e.g. women who are well positioned to make a difference).
Even if you can’t contribute monetarily, please do share this campaign with your friends and social network in order to spread the word.
The different levels of perks allow you to choose the extent of your impact on this movement. Each necklace comes in a gift bag with inspiring words and poem. It is made of high quality nickel with silver plate and can be ordered in either all silver or silver egg with gold Earth.

Why I am Confident that I can Make a Difference!
 
My work is for social justice, peace, compassion and beauty, this is the focus of my life’s work. In all my artwork, the purpose is to help create a better world.  My art is a powerful avenue for communicating these values.
Sacred art pieces speak to the traditions and connections to those who came before us, while imparting the history to those who came after.  I create sacred pieces that speak to many different religions and their traditions. To me the expression of art is a language that allows the viewer to feel and understand the artist emotionally. The voice inside me is loud, it yells at me to make a difference, speak out, be the change I want to see. Through the process of my work I try to communicate this voice. I believe it is my responsibility as an artist to give back to the world, to see the need for beauty where there is none, to see the place for healing when there is pain and thru my talents and my heart create a place of peace.
I am the founder & president of A Busy Woman Consulting, helping non-profit organizations create events, raise funds, and develop business.

The amount of funding required to get the project running is quite substantial. We have already invested a lot of money in designing and creating our samples.
In order to launch our project we need to pay the herders, manufacturers and transportation costs.
We intend to overcome this issue by reaching out to Indiegogo!
We have a great project and we desperately need your backing!
Time
We are working with some great manufacturers, but time is against us. 
If we do not manage to raise the funding soon, we will have to wait until next year to restart the scarf project.
We are very determined to succeed in this project and will do all that we can get get the ball rolling.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>RFID BLOCKING MATERIAL</p>
<p>Something we are very proud of with these wallets is it is not only thin, stylish and useful. It has <b>Integrated RFID Blocking</b> material. Yes that is right each wallet has a special material that allows it to block any RFID.</p>
<p><b>What is RFID?</b></p>
<p>""Radio-frequency identification (<b>RFID</b>) is the 
wireless use of electromagnetic fields to transfer data, for the 
purposes of automatically identifying and tracking tags attached to 
objects. The tags contain electronically stored information."" </p>
<p>So basically what that means is anyone with an RFID scanner can come by and just scan your pockets and steal <b>all</b> the information on your credit cards.</p>
<p>But
 why should you care about this your identity has never been stolen? 
Well take a look at this ridiculous fact that happens to so many.<br/>""The number of identity theft incidents has reached <b>9.9 million</b> a year, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Every minute about <b>19 people</b>
 fall victim to identity theft. It takes the average victim an estimated
 $500 and 30 hours to resolve each identity theft crime.""</p>

These unique wallets are some of the most stylish and useful wallets on the market today. Did we mention it is also noticeably slimmer than your ordinary leather wallet? I love and collect wallets, and have about 20 different kinds. I have leather, plastic, elastic and metal. You name it I have it. I use a variety of wallets and have always wanted one that could meet all the essential needs that someone could have. Doing all this while keeping the wallet under .24"" thickness and also using the best most trusted wallet material of all time. Beautiful genuine leather. These wallets will last you a lifetime and only through kickstarter can you get them at a ridiculously low price!
RFID BLOCKING MATERIAL
Something we are very proud of with these wallets is it is not only thin, stylish and useful. It has Integrated RFID Blocking material. Yes that is right each wallet has a special material that allows it to block any RFID.
What is RFID?
""Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the 
wireless use of electromagnetic fields to transfer data, for the 
purposes of automatically identifying and tracking tags attached to 
objects. The tags contain electronically stored information."" 
So basically what that means is anyone with an RFID scanner can come by and just scan your pockets and steal all the information on your credit cards.
But
 why should you care about this your identity has never been stolen? 
Well take a look at this ridiculous fact that happens to so many.""The number of identity theft incidents has reached 9.9 million a year, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Every minute about 19 people
 fall victim to identity theft. It takes the average victim an estimated
 $500 and 30 hours to resolve each identity theft crime.""



Each wallet can hold up to 6 cards and still remain a very slim and minimalist wallet. The money clip is also extremely durable and and awesome alternative to carrying your cash around every day. This wallet helps preserve the simple elegance that is leather, while adding in a few new features that are sure to impress. 
The wallet is EXTREMELY  minimalistic. 


Each wallet is only 1.29oz(36.5grams) and each wallet is only 4.25""x2.5""x.24""  or 108x63x6.1mm
YES, at only .24 inches thick it is extremely thin and can still hold all your cash as well as up to 6 cards.

The Design
We wanted a wallet that was 
-Lightweight
-Extremely thin
-Different than the same old bulky bifold
-Affordable
-Superb Quality 

Possible LIFETIME warranty Now here's the thing we are most 
excited about and that is we have set up a great relationship with one 
of the most trusted manufactures I have ever worked with. I know what 
your thinking, how can a small company offer lifetime warranty? I may be
 jumping the gun here but we already have a number of CRAZY stretch goals which will be released if the project reaches its goal. This will literally be the LAST WALLET you will ever need. That is what we are most excited about, so please jump on board with us now and take advantage of the insanely low prices!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Founded in 2014, <b>Lieb Ju</b>, a Denglish word pronounced /<i>’li:b ju:</i>/, means “love you” and “love yourself”. </p>
<p>It started off with women's hand bags. Now, one year later, Kiera, our CEO &amp; designer, is putting her better half on the market. Kiera's better half is of course, the men's collection! Hang Tough - My Way.</p>
<p>Why is the men's collection named <b>Hang Tough</b>?<br/>Hang Tough represents the ambition, power, ingenuity and multifaceted nature of real men. We took the time to observe men, study them and their movements, because every man should be able to sport a bag fashionably and with taste. For real men who are professional and like to cut loose, we have developed the Life and Executive Lines.</p>

<b>Start:</b><br/>In February 2015 we started to work on a novel generation of business bags. Based on innovative ideas, high quality materials and technological knowhow. Our first productions resulted in combinations of leather and metal.<br/>Based on our private resources we developed and tested the first prototypes.<br/><br/><b>Intermediate goals we have already achieved:</b><br/><ul>
<li>Design and development of a novel, high quality collection of prototypes<br/>
</li>
<li>Raw materials from Europe<br/>
</li>
<li>Production within Europe<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<br/><b>Final goal of the Indiegogo campaign:</b><br/>$ 15,000 would enable us to start marketing and sales of a first collection. In addition, further development and enlargement of the collection could be induced by this.<br/>

Why is the men's collection named Hang Tough?Hang Tough represents the ambition, power, ingenuity and multifaceted nature of real men. We took the time to observe men, study them and their movements, because every man should be able to sport a bag fashionably and with taste. For real men who are professional and like to cut loose, we have developed the Life and Executive Lines.

Hang Tough - Luxury Bags for your business.








Life Line - Messenger Bag Perks


 










The Path Less Taken - Materials & Design 



We asked ourselves - what do real men want?

Practicality, and
Taste

They are highlights to your personality.

Let's Hang Tough Together - Campaign “Unique with Attitude”




Start:In February 2015 we started to work on a novel generation of business bags. Based on innovative ideas, high quality materials and technological knowhow. Our first productions resulted in combinations of leather and metal.Based on our private resources we developed and tested the first prototypes.Intermediate goals we have already achieved:
Design and development of a novel, high quality collection of prototypes

Raw materials from Europe

Production within Europe


Final goal of the Indiegogo campaign:$ 15,000 would enable us to start marketing and sales of a first collection. In addition, further development and enlargement of the collection could be induced by this.

the hang tag, and
an elegant metal plate located inside each bag.

You will also get a thank you card. You can choose to receive your perk via post or come to our studio in Germany so we can get to know you and your namesake a little better.
The cherry on top: we will share your dedication with bloggers and the press announcing any information you decide to share with us as to the purpose of your dedication.

The creation the two of you come up with will forever be marked with your name in remembrance of the Ibiza spirit, Lieb Ju care and doing it like Hang Tough - my way!

</div><div> <p>The Chameleon Smartwatch is LucanTech's answer to the shortcomings of current offerings in the market that present low end choices of glorified pedometers to higher end offerings that must be tethered to your cellphone to achieve full functionality of the device.  </p>
<p>We believe a smartwatch should be a companion device for your cellphone when you want, but also <b>function independently</b> to offer a seamless, connected <b>4G experience</b> when you choose to leave your phone behind.  </p>
<p>We believe <b>bio sensors</b> should be integrated in the same device that supports <b>GPS </b>and <b>music</b> during your workout.</p>
<p>We believe in <b>modular design</b> and the advantages of <b>highly customizable</b> functionality, individualized styling, and upgradability to extend the use of your wearable device and<b> reduce e-waste</b>.   </p>
<p>We believe the adoption of mobile payments for convenience and security can be accelerated through the use of <b>unique mag strip emulation </b>that does not depend on merchant investment in unique point of sale devices.</p>
<p>If you share these beliefs and vision for what a smartwatch can be, we ask you to <b>read on and join us</b> in support of this campaign!</p>

</div><p><b>FAQs</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>What is a SmartWatch? </b>According to
     Google, A SmartWatch is a mobile device with a touchscreen
     display, designed to be worn on the wrist. ""the main
     benefit of a SmartWatch is that it keeps you constantly updated without
     having to whip out your smartphone""</li>
<li>
<b>What is modularity? </b>Modularity refers to hardware
     features that can be added or removed from the base design allowing
     consumers to personalize their SmartWatch. 
     Modularity assures that consumers own a product they are happy
     with, extends product life.</li>
<li>
<b>How is LucanTech SmartWatch
     Modular? </b>The
     LucanTech SmartWatch has a unique patent pending design that accommodates
     different hardware modules to be plugged onto the watch similar to the way
     you would plug in a USB stick to a computer.  Modularity allows you to personalize
     your watch hardware to cater your needs</li>
<li>
<b>What modules are available? </b>We will create many of our own
     attachments but we are excited to see what others create as we are an open
     platform.  Initially we plan to
     produce heart rate monitor, USB, Audio jack, credit card swipe, and
     microphone but plan to produce a high resolution camera and more as we
     move forward.  We will work with 3<sup>rd</sup>
     party partners to develop many more modules.</li>
<li>
<b>How is LucanTech SmartWatch
     Modularity different than other modular watches? </b> We have designed in modularity to enhance
     your experience and not limit it. 
     Our base SmartWatch is complete and includes everything you would
     need out of the box.  The modules
     are additional features to cater to your needs and lifestyle.  All other “modular SmartWatches” require
     you to use or buy modules for basic features like GPS, gyroscope etc.
     which defeats the idea of modularity.</li>
<li>
<b>What processor
     are you using?  </b>Unlike other
     SmartWatches in the market, we have decided to use Intel 64bit Quad Core
     CPUs with integrated 4G LTE to give us the ultimate power and flexibility.</li>
<li>
<b>What Operating System do you
     support?</b>Our
     SmartWatches will run either Windows 10 or Latest full Android.  You will be able to choose what OS
     before shipment.</li>
<li>
<b>What is the
     Battery Capacity?  </b>This is where our
     product Rocks!  Our base models will
     have ~800mAh batteries embedded on to the bands.  We are also planning to offer additional
     ~1000mAh optional battery for the case.</li>
<li>
<b>Can I change my
     bands?  </b>Yes!  You can change the skins that go on to
     the bands.  </li>
<li>
<b>What is fingerprint
     reader? </b> A
     fingerprint reader is a device that uses your fingerprint to identify you.
      It is more secure than facial and voice recognition and works by
     taking an image of your finger print and matches to a master copy it has
     securely stored.</li>
<li>
<b>What is NFC? </b>NFC (Near Field Communication)

     not been converted to accept wireless transactions.  LucanTech Smartwatch includes NFC, but will
     also work anywhere a traditional credit card terminal is available.  LucanTech has a unique partnership with
     Omne Mobile Payments to offer a complete digital wallet feature that will
     work anywhere a traditional credit card terminal is available.  Paired with a finger print reader, bio
     sensors and a secure element, our cellular SmartWatch offers the most
     secure digital wallet yet! </li>
<li>
<b>How does the LucanTech
     SmartWatch credit card emulation work? </b>Unlike the current solutions
     like Apple Pay, which relies on NFC, the solution on LucanTech watches
     emulate the magnetic stripe data from cards and send that data wirelessly
     to traditional credit card terminals. The terminal detects that data as if
     a card has been swiped through it and processes it in the same way as a
     plastic credit card would.  This
     means you can use your LucanTech SmartWatch to pay for anything from gas
     for your car to groceries anywhere traditional credit cards are accepted!</li>
<li>
<b>How do I conduct a transaction
     using my watch? </b>LucanTech takes the security of your information very seriously.

     secure without making it inconvenient for you to access. When you put on
     your LucanTech SmartWatch, the biometric sensors will be able to recognize
     that you are now wearing your watch. You will then be able to unlock it on
     demand with your fingerprint, choose the credit card you want, wave your

LucanTech Smartwatch in the press






Lucan technologies, Inc. Introduces a Completely Re-Designed Modular Smartwatch







Why are we excited about the Chameleon Smartwatch?
 The Chameleon Smartwatch is LucanTech's answer to the shortcomings of current offerings in the market that present low end choices of glorified pedometers to higher end offerings that must be tethered to your cellphone to achieve full functionality of the device.  
We believe a smartwatch should be a companion device for your cellphone when you want, but also function independently to offer a seamless, connected 4G experience when you choose to leave your phone behind.  
We believe bio sensors should be integrated in the same device that supports GPS and music during your workout.
We believe in modular design and the advantages of highly customizable functionality, individualized styling, and upgradability to extend the use of your wearable device and reduce e-waste.   
We believe the adoption of mobile payments for convenience and security can be accelerated through the use of unique mag strip emulation that does not depend on merchant investment in unique point of sale devices.
If you share these beliefs and vision for what a smartwatch can be, we ask you to read on and join us in support of this campaign!



What We Need & What You Get
 We need your support to achieve a successful Indiegogo campaign that will:   Provide the funds necessary to complete our design and bring a truly innovative product to market.
Create greater awareness for the vision and advantages of the first modular smartwatch.
Help disrupt complacent smartwatch design that is satisfied with choices of reduced functionality or a required companion device.

Supporters can add their voice and share in several perks including: Heavily discounted offerings for early adopters.
Eligibility for sweepstakes drawing for free Chameleon Smartwatches. 
Participation in promotional items as shown in Perks 
Share in contributions to the Mercy Corps Refugee Crisis Response Fund to aid those in need. 



   The Impact We have spend nearly a year to perfect our design.  We believe that the current smartwatch companies can and should produce better products with more features with the consumers in mind.  Dissatisfied with what is available, we have taken on the challenge!  We believe that this product when completed, will disrupt the current offerings and result in better products for all. 



Risks & Challenges  
Our team is comprised of seasoned entrepreneurs, hardware and software designers, fashion gurus, user experience designers, and supply chain experts with more than 20 years of entrepreneurial and manufacturing experience, so rest assured the smartwatches will exceed your expectations.
We are technologists, innovators and fashion designers! We have done our homework, so the risks are minimal. We have identified and locked in our manufacturers and technology partners. 
We are developing a truly unique and revolutionary product and paying attention to every detail.    We are leveraging decades of experience and key learning from 100s of products developed at companies like Intel, Dell, and IBM.  Hence, our products come with the best quality, with no compromises and no excuses!
Other Ways You Can Help
 We recognize that not all our supporters are in the market for a smartwatch. However, if you share our passion for modular design, reduction of e-waste, and independent functionality we ask for your support in other ways:  Use the Indiegogo tools to share our message and help inspire others to consider what is possible in smartwatch technology, beyond the limitation of current offerings. Confirm we are on the right track and voice your desire for change with a contribution of $5 or more, while yielding a donation to help with the current refugee crisis.

<p></p>
<div><div>
<p><span><span>There are wolves. There are sheep. And there are Sheepdogs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are hundreds of references to shepherds and sheep in the Bible.  In both literal and parabolic context, sheep represent innocence, goodness, purity, and even weakness.  Similarly, wolves and other predators represent evil, wrongdoing, deceit and ugliness.  In Psalms 23, David refers to the Lord as his Shepherd.  In the New Testament, there are references to Christ as both Lamb and the Shepherd.  As our Great Shepherd, God promises to look after His flock.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Additionally, throughout history there is much documentation of the important role that Sheepdogs held in their relationship to the shepherd and his flock. Always vigilant. Loyal.

<p><span><span>Much time has passed, and many things have changed since the earliest mention of Abel, son of Adam, as the first keeper of sheep.

<p><span><span>Good remains victorious only because there are still those who are called.  Those born to serve.  Those who will stand against the evil that threatens the flock.   They protect the weak.  They defend the innocent.  They will run toward the danger from which others flee.  They will proactively seek out those who would harm their flock, and destroy them.  They will, if necessary, give their lives in defense of their flock.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>They are our first responders.  They are our front line.  They are our first, and sometimes our last and only defense.  Military, Police, Fire, and others.  Our neighbors, our friends, our brothers and sisters.  They are to be revered, heralded as heroes.  They are to be lifted up as servants of the Great Shepherd, and to be honored when in their midst.  </span></span></p>

Sheepdog Significance


There are wolves. There are sheep. And there are Sheepdogs.
There are hundreds of references to shepherds and sheep in the Bible.  In both literal and parabolic context, sheep represent innocence, goodness, purity, and even weakness.  Similarly, wolves and other predators represent evil, wrongdoing, deceit and ugliness.  In Psalms 23, David refers to the Lord as his Shepherd.  In the New Testament, there are references to Christ as both Lamb and the Shepherd.  As our Great Shepherd, God promises to look after His flock.
Additionally, throughout history there is much documentation of the important role that Sheepdogs held in their relationship to the shepherd and his flock. Always vigilant. Loyal. Tirelessly performing the thankless duty of protecting the flock. Why? Because that's what God created Sheepdogs to do. This is their calling.
Much time has passed, and many things have changed since the earliest mention of Abel, son of Adam, as the first keeper of sheep. Wolves, however, still persist in their desire to bring harm and wrong to the world. Daily, there is a struggle, where only the strength and will of the chosen few can ensure the victory of good over evil.
Good remains victorious only because there are still those who are called.  Those born to serve.  Those who will stand against the evil that threatens the flock.   They protect the weak.  They defend the innocent.  They will run toward the danger from which others flee.  They will proactively seek out those who would harm their flock, and destroy them.  They will, if necessary, give their lives in defense of their flock.
They are our first responders.  They are our front line.  They are our first, and sometimes our last and only defense.  Military, Police, Fire, and others.  Our neighbors, our friends, our brothers and sisters.  They are to be revered, heralded as heroes.  They are to be lifted up as servants of the Great Shepherd, and to be honored when in their midst.  
They are SHEEPDOGS.
   What We Need & What You Get We are trying to generate capital to up our standing inventory, break into retail markets, and upgrade our equipment so that production can keep up with the demand that follows.  Specifically, we need to purchase a conveyor dryer and up our standing inventory by several thousand dollars so that our printing can become more of an ""assembly line"" rather than the current one at a time.  With our ability to produce more, we'll be able to seek larger market partners to continue to grow the Sheepdog brand, and our mission of honoring our heroes. More visibility and more sales means more giving back, see below. Our campaign is set up with the ""Flexible Funding"" option, which means that EVERY person who provides funding will receive their promised perk.  ** We are already producing, and have produced, hundreds of shirts, and are capable of filling all perk obligations even if we fail to reach our funding goal to upgrade our equipment. **

We hope that the exposure of our campaign will help us to develop partners who can help us ensure that any family who desires to have their hero memorialized with a Sheepdog T-shirt can have that happen.

<p>So, we are asking for
just $1,500 to help us get shirts printed and ordered. If we break that
barrier, any money over and above our target will be donated to <b>Big

</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The major risk in being a part of this event is that while I am organising for Fashion Week I will simultaneously be preparing for Slaeve to go into production, ready to sell.

Preparation and Creation. As the collection is yet to be finished, there is still money needed to be spent on materials, but also on items to go alongside each of the 10 looks (shoes, accessories, etc.)






What You GetEvery dollar contributed can never be thanked enough. However, in my best efforts, these are some of the things you will be awarded with if you conrtibute:


Detailed concept sketches of sample designs for the premier collection.
Personal copy of retail look-book.
Discount codes for brand release later this year.
Copy of ""Slaeve: Beginning"" online and hardcopy zine detailing the story, design and ambitions of the brand.
VIP to showcase events such as release parties.  

    The Impact Just like anyone who is passionate about something, I have put hours upon hours each day into creating something I love. Now I have an opportunity to show some of the more influential people in the industry how I do things. The reasons why this is so important to me are:  Massive amount of exposure for the Slaeve label National and International Recognition, but most importantly: It will make my parents so proud! 



   Risks & Challenges The major risk in being a part of this event is that while I am organising for Fashion Week I will simultaneously be preparing for Slaeve to go into production, ready to sell. This will be a massive challenge, and having financing for the event covered will make this so much easier.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you are not able to contribute financially but you still want to help, here are some ways you can:


Share this to Faebook! Let everyone know and hopefully someone you know might be able to help too! If you do share this, send me an email and I will thank you personally for your help. (ezekiel@lonelylonely.net)
Follow Slaeve on social medias, and watch things take off!
Comment and show support! Any words of positivity really do help at 2 am when I really want to sleep.

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Kathy and I love powerlifting. I was pretty lost in life and came across the sport by accident. I have always loved making things, especially clothing designs. I see a lot of potential in the market for powerlifting-focused activewear. Plus, it's fun! I will pick a charity each month and send 30% of proceeds to it. I will show receipts of donation!</p>
</div><div>
<p>First up on the list is a working computer. Currently, I'm using a computer from 2014 that I purchased for $50 from a friend. It runs occasionally. Actually, it runs more than i do! Sadly, it's on it's last leg. </p>
<p>Other financial needs are backstock. I would like to have a solid backstock before actually selling. I need to purchase perks and basics for my line, and I would love to be able to get that going. Anything left will go straight to the process of moving away from a hosting site and having an actual storefront. In the future I would also love to have artist's drop their own lines and reap the royalites. </p>
</div><div>
<p>My goal is to make lifting accessible to everyone by making designs for all types of people. For a hobbyist weightlifter to an elite athlete, I want everyone to celebrate their gains alike!</p>
<p>Taking this leap does come with challenges. I still work full time and am training for competition. With funds, I could also help pay a few friends to help with this process. </p>
</div><div><p>Times are tough and I definitely understand how donating is only feasible for some. I would really appreciate even share or a tag. Anything helps and I will never forget anyone who helps me. </p></div></div>","Summary:

<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Customers usually visit several online shopping websites looking for buying products at the desired cost, size and colour.</strong></p>

The Impact


1. Customers usually visit several online shopping websites looking for buying products at the desired cost, size and colour.
If a customer is looking to buy a product from online shopping for a certain price or size or colour usually visits a particular online website ( may be of a particular brand) and buys the product but finds out that for a reasonably lesser price the customer could have bought the same product from another online website where the product is of the same quality, colour and size. 
2. Online shopping on websites is traditional way of shopping as one needs to perform 4 to 5 steps to filter, scroll and buy the desired product.
Most of the ecommerce/online shopping websites have search bar where we could type the product we are looking for and click on search and the products are displayed for shopping and then we need to select the subcategory size, colour before we buy the desired product and if we are typing products with specifications like size, colour and price in the search bar and then search the results are not good.
3. Customers are unaware of websites to visit which offers discounts to buy desired products across all major brands.
When customers are looking for a product which has discounted price across various  websites of top brands always find it challenging to find the best but with chatshoppie any product with discounts across various brands are all shown in one place for customers to buy which makes online shopping experience easy and convenient.
4. Customers usually wait few seconds to minutes  for websites to load and get frustrated more so during festivals.
Website page loading concern is one of the most common issue for most of the online shoppers, and its seveare more so during festivals, special events and holidays. Chatshoppie is developed on highly robust cognitive architecture using the cognitive services which aims to deliver both response and products in few seconds that is in conjunction with the vision of company.
5. Downloading various mobile apps for online shopping will consume more memory and screen space which slows down the performance of the downloaded apps as well as the mobile, on the contrary, one Chatshoppie mobile app will fix the above mentioned issues as the app shows products of various brands all in one place.
6. Lack of customer interaction, personalised workflows and the ability to react dynamically to customer’s request.
 Online shopping on websites has neither dynamic customer interaction capability nor the ability to display products based on customer profile mapping  and more over customers have to navigate on the websites looking for products which is frustrating as its time consuming.

<p>Hello World! My name is Nathaniel Wilson, and I am a 20-year-old entrepreneur! I am the owner of ""What's The T', a Black Queer apparel brand that combines ancient symbology with colloquialisms and Black Queer interests! We feel that it is now time for us to step into the true purpose and intent of our Brand, and that is to create Healing Crystal infused T-shirts! Yes! That's right! Healing crystal infused T-shirts! I want to make clothing that is fashionable and supports the energetic healing and energetic protection of a person. This type of modality is especially important for marginalized groups because it allows us to be fabulous and yet fiercely protected by Earth's magic! By contributing to our campaign, you will not only be helping a small business to grow, but you will be helping to pave new ways for fashion to become more ecologically centered through earth intelligence!</p>
<p>                                                           What we need.</p>
<p>We need $10,000.00 to accomplish our goal! 10,000.00 will cover the cost of producing 200 crystal infused t-shirts. A set of 50 healing crystal shirts cost $2,000.00 to manufacture due to the cost of sourcing the crystals, crushing them, and then infusing them with our apparel ink. Then, we have to create a screen to screenprint the designs onto the shirts. The four designs that we will be producing are:</p>
<p>Logunede- Logunede is an Orisha from Nigeria's Yoruba religion and represents untouched and untested Beauty, and is androgynous, and is given lots of love by the LGBT community.</p>
<p>Oshumare- Oshumare is also an Orisha and is the spirit of the rainbow. Oshumare is androgynous as well.</p>
<p>Oshun- Oshun is probably the most widely known and loved, Orisha! She is the spirit of Beauty, sensuality, magic, wealth, and love!</p>
<p> For the fourth design, we will create an image of a Black gay couple in a loving embrace! We feel that it is essential to show love in all of its various forms directly and affirming way! </p>
<p>The crystals that we will use to produce our shirts will be Rose Quartz, Shungite, and Carnelian. The Benefits of these crystals are:   </p>
<p>Rose Quartz: A stone of universal love! This crystal purifies and opens the Heart Chakra to love and harmony in all relationships.</p>
<p>Shungite: Reduces inflammation, and EMF exposure, and relieve emotional stress,</p>
<p>Carnelian: Helps to overcome abuse of any kind, restores vitality, and motivates one to become successful!</p>
<p>Lastly, the remaining 2,000.00 will go towards creating a beautiful, eco-friendly crystal decorated packaging box for our customers to have an all-around immersive experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                                            What you get!</p>
<p>Each Donor will receive a free crystal infused T-shirt of their choice, and 30% off their Next ""What's The T"" purchase! Also, Donors will receive VIP access to all of ""What's the T's"" future product lines and also get the chance to tell us what you would love to see us create! We want our donors to stay involved as much as possible, and so we will always be open to receiving YOUR ideas, insights, and visions!</p>
<p>If we fail to reach our full goal, all of the funds that have been raised will still go into producing as many crystal infused shirts as the funds will allow. At Minimum we will need $500.00 to maintain production. However, ANY AMOUNT HELPS!!! Lastly, if we do not meet the goal in this campaign we will create another campaign to to meet our desired goal. We will keep going until we reach our goal because we are passionate about bringing Crystal Infused Apparel To The World!!!</p>
<p>                                                                The Impact!</p>
<p> Our project is valuable because it gives a voice and presence to healing modalities through a Black Queer lense! Black and Black Queer people have been revolutionary over the past 40 years in introducing many popular indigenous healing practices prevalent in our society. Sadly, we have been forgotten! Our project is also valuable because we are using clothing and crystals as a means of upliftment, representation, and protection! Currently, in our store, we sell unisex Hamsa tees, and they are most popular because they represent all of what we are aiming to do with our work! Lastly, We feel that our project can inspire a cultural shift in where we begin to look at fashion as a reflection and tool for connecting with the Earth energetically through healing modalities infused into clothing, whether it be through chromotherapy, crystal-infused clothing, organic threads, beading, and much more!</p>
<p>                                                       Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>As with any new endeavor, there are always risks and challenges. We see that our significant risks and challenge right now is being able to make and maintain sales during the pandemic. However, we feel that this can be remedied through excellent marketing and vending at small local flea markets.   Another risk and challenge is people being skeptical of our products' healing benefits, and we feel that this trust in us can be built reviews, consistency, customer interaction, and dedication to creating quality products. </p>
<p>                                          How else can you get involved?</p>
<p>One of the best ways to get involved is by sharing our campaign on your social media pages! </p>
<p>Thank you so much, and if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to send us an email at Info@Whatsthett.com!</p>

                                                            What you get!
Each Donor will receive a free crystal infused T-shirt of their choice, and 30% off their Next ""What's The T"" purchase! Also, Donors will receive VIP access to all of ""What's the T's"" future product lines and also get the chance to tell us what you would love to see us create!

If we fail to reach our full goal, all of the funds that have been raised will still go into producing as many crystal infused shirts as the funds will allow. At Minimum we will need $500.00 to maintain production. However, ANY AMOUNT HELPS!!! Lastly, if we do not meet the goal in this campaign we will create another campaign to to meet our desired goal. We will keep going until we reach our goal because we are passionate about bringing Crystal Infused Apparel To The World!!!
                                                                The Impact!
 Our project is valuable because it gives a voice and presence to healing modalities through a Black Queer lense! Black and Black Queer people have been revolutionary over the past 40 years in introducing many popular indigenous healing practices prevalent in our society. Sadly, we have been forgotten! Our project is also valuable because we are using clothing and crystals as a means of upliftment, representation, and protection! Currently, in our store, we sell unisex Hamsa tees, and they are most popular because they represent all of what we are aiming to do with our work! Lastly, We feel that our project can inspire a cultural shift in where we begin to look at fashion as a reflection and tool for connecting with the Earth energetically through healing modalities infused into clothing, whether it be through chromotherapy, crystal-infused clothing, organic threads, beading, and much more!
                                                       Risks & Challenges
As with any new endeavor, there are always risks and challenges. We see that our significant risks and challenge right now is being able to make and maintain sales during the pandemic. However, we feel that this can be remedied through excellent marketing and vending at small local flea markets.   Another risk and challenge is people being skeptical of our products' healing benefits, and we feel that this trust in us can be built reviews, consistency, customer interaction, and dedication to creating quality products. 
                                          How else can you get involved?
One of the best ways to get involved is by sharing our campaign on your social media pages!

<p><strong>WIK is the light you need, at the moment you need it.</strong> A light on your wrist that frees up your hands. WIK features a uniquely stylish and comfortable design, an innovative magnetic band, amazing battery life, and LED lights that will not dim.</p>

<p>Let's face it, the old flashlight and headlamp desperately need to evolve. WIK is the next gen light you've been looking for. When life comes your way, whether you're on a run, hiking the trail, or blazing your own path, WIK is there when you need it. When other devices aren't up to the task, or their battery died long ago, WIK is the natural evolution to fill your lighting needs. </p>

<p>Flashlights and headlamps have been around for ages. We are so used to them that its difficult to see that light needs an update. Have you ever tried using the light on your cell phone? Been frustrated that you can't quite position it? Had a headlamp leave a mark on your forehead? Those days are finally over. Meet WIK!</p>

<p>“WIK is the best light I’ve tried, hands down. The powerful LED light provides a smooth and broad pan of light without the usual tunnel effect. It is water resistant and has an innovative magnetic band that allows you to use it in all kinds of ways- on your wrist like a watch, around a belt, around a pack strap, around a bike post, or just about anywhere you can fit the band around. When I first tried the WIK, I was shocked at how comfortable the lighting in front of me was. I had a nice big area of light as I wore it on my water bottle belt while I ran. It also goes great on any area you can secure it to on a running vest or water vest. The light and band are extremely light which is a nice change from bulky, bouncing headlamps.”</p>

<p>A lot of thought went into finding the right LED's. <strong>WIK's high efficient LED's allow for optimal balance between battery life and brightness. </strong>WIK's light is ambient so it lights up your entire area. WIK's LED's will never dim so you can enjoy WIK's full luminosity for the entire life of it's battery. </p>

<p>The red LED light will help preserve both your night vision. High and low intensities give you several lighting options. <strong>WIK's unique white to red flashing mode makes you extremely visible to others.</strong></p>

<p>Rain? Sweat? <strong>No problem. WIK is water-resistant.</strong> Feel confident that WIK will stand up to the elements. The band can also be removed for cleaning. <strong>WIK's housing and band are both durable and comfortable. Much lighter than a typical flashlight or headlamp. </strong></p>

<p>This is where WIK really sets itself apart. The band was one of the most difficult features to design, but I nailed it! <strong>WIK's band opens up a world of possibilities and gives WIK unprecedented versatility. </strong></p>

<p>As an avid long-distance runner, I have struggled to find the right light. Running the ultramarathon's night section is one of the biggest challenges - you either have to hold a flashlight or wear a headlamp which gets uncomfortable, causes tunnel vision, and often produces a kind of flat light that washes out rocks and roots on the trail making it more likely to trip and fall. </p>

</div></div>","WIK is the light you need, at the moment you need it. A light on your wrist that frees up your hands. WIK features a uniquely stylish and comfortable design, an innovative magnetic band, amazing battery life, and LED lights that will not dim.


Let's face it, the old flashlight and headlamp desperately need to evolve. WIK is the next gen light you've been looking for. When life comes your way, whether you're on a run, hiking the trail, or blazing your own path, WIK is there when you need it. When other devices aren't up to the task, or their battery died long ago, WIK is the natural evolution to fill your lighting needs. 

Flashlights and headlamps have been around for ages. We are so used to them that its difficult to see that light needs an update. Have you ever tried using the light on your cell phone? Been frustrated that you can't quite position it? Had a headlamp leave a mark on your forehead? Those days are finally over. Meet WIK!

                  
Product review by Rusty Cannon:

“WIK is the best light I’ve tried, hands down. The powerful LED light provides a smooth and broad pan of light without the usual tunnel effect. It is water resistant and has an innovative magnetic band that allows you to use it in all kinds of ways- on your wrist like a watch, around a belt, around a pack strap, around a bike post, or just about anywhere you can fit the band around. When I first tried the WIK, I was shocked at how comfortable the lighting in front of me was. I had a nice big area of light as I wore it on my water bottle belt while I ran. It also goes great on any area you can secure it to on a running vest or water vest. The light and band are extremely light which is a nice change from bulky, bouncing headlamps.”

A lot of thought went into finding the right LED's. WIK's high efficient LED's allow for optimal balance between battery life and brightness. WIK's light is ambient so it lights up your entire area. WIK's LED's will never dim so you can enjoy WIK's full luminosity for the entire life of it's battery. 

The red LED light will help preserve both your night vision. High and low intensities give you several lighting options. WIK's unique white to red flashing mode makes you extremely visible to others.



Rain? Sweat? No problem. WIK is water-resistant. Feel confident that WIK will stand up to the elements. The band can also be removed for cleaning. WIK's housing and band are both durable and comfortable. Much lighter than a typical flashlight or headlamp. 


This is where WIK really sets itself apart. The band was one of the most difficult features to design, but I nailed it! WIK's band opens up a world of possibilities and gives WIK unprecedented versatility. 

The two sections of magnets allow you to orient WIK into several configurations. Point WIK's LED's up to light up a room. Point them down to light up a specific area.

WIK's magnets are strong enough to attach through most materials, and keep it firmly in place. Attach WIK through the outside material and still be able to use the pocket. Genius!

Loop WIK's band around anything: your wrist, your belt, a pipe, your bike, a tree branch, anything! 

On top of that, WIK is weighted in such a way that it can even be draped over non-magnectic objects like a cupboard.

WIK's ergonomic design makes the band peel on and off as opposed to snap together. The magnets are ribbed and fold onto each other creating a strong hold on and off your wrist. 
 

WIK's rechargeable lithium-ion battery coupled with its high-efficient LED's gives it an amazing battery life and light output. WIK will last up to 6 hours on high, 12 hours on low and 3 days on flashing mode.   

Most flashlights, headlamps, and other battery-powered lights dim with use. Not WIK. WIK's patent-pending electronics keep the light from dimming. WIK will not dim as the battery is being used, and can be used while charging.

Their design artistry is deeply rooted in brand identity, graphic design, and cause-oriented initiatives. Together, we created an attainable, expressive, ultra-luxury dress shoe that comes packed with features and is designed for comfort. The traditional construction of men’s boots and shoes are combined with our innovative design and bold patterns. Thatcher Finch shoes are built for the progressive stylist. Help us make our first production!We’ve mastered the process of printing on leather to create a seamless, wear tested, and bold statement on each shoe. Using a digital application process, our patterns bond directly to the leather to create a long-lasting wear, avoid flaking, and reduce the visibility of scuffs.Thatcher Finch will be built around you, our audience. Our website will introduce a unique place for our audience to submit their inspired artwork and connect it directly to a cause they’re passionate about. Each shoe design will be voted on and selected by, the Thatcher Finch community for production. We’re creating shoes that are comfortable, elegant, exciting, and most importantly- inspired. By using our audience inspired design process we’re uniting our efforts, in walking toward causes we’re passionate about.

Music unites, uplifts, inspires and brings about wide-scale change. The music note boot reflects a common identity, we all share.
Our floral boot is a tribute to the beauty of the natural world we live in and our need to be mindful of our environmental impact.Traditional style meets the modern gentleman. Our gold fleck shoe is a reflection of the constant opportunity to be innovative and bold. We chose a midnight color that can be worn as a black or dark navy shoe.

But it came with a price - according to a 2018 study, combined, the global apparel and footwear industries account for an estimated 8% of the World´s greenhouse gas emissions. October 2018 we decided that it is enough and we have to act - That is when we came up with idea of Nøgen Steps(Nøgen in Danish means Naked). We've made a commitment: luxury has to be accessible, well made and most importantly - it does not have to kill Our planet! We want to be an example that sets high standards for fashion industry and changing fashion consumer behaviorThe question for You right now is: Do #YouCareWhatYouWear ? If your answer is - Yes, go on and check out our first collection and how we do what we do.We are the Socially & Environmentally aware Premium Sneakers Brand.We think that the fashion industry is broken, and that there’s a better way of doing things. We put sustainability at the core of everything. That means better materials, processes, longer lasting and really versatile sneakers.It’s our mission to lead the footwear industry on REAL SUSTAINABILITY.We PLANT A TREE for every pair sold.We donate a pair of sneakers to PEOPLE IN NEED for every 4 pairs sold.NØGEN is luxury for everyone, and the planet! FOLLOW OUR JOURNEY   Our first collection is inspired by the Street Basketball of the 90's, with a minimal twist to make of our sneakers a timeless and very versatile piece.         #HappyFeetHappySoulAt Nøgen we are really committed to save our planet and leave a better space to the generations to come. In collaboration with the NGO: ONE TREE PLANTED, every time you buy a pair of sneakers we plant a tree.The Atlantic Forest, also known as Mata Atlantica, once covered 130 million hectares across Brazil. Now, this tropical rain forest ecosystem is home to more than half of the country’s population. Centuries of deforestation for timber, sugar cane, coffee, cattle ranching, and urban sprawl have reduced the size of the forest by over 90%. Although the water supply for Brazil’s two most populous cities (Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo) comes from this forest, there is a lack of public policies and resources to protect it.Our partners in Brazil are working to restore 15 million hectares of the Atlantic Forest by 2050. By helping plant trees in this critically important forest we are promoting the conservation of biodiversity, creating jobs and income opportunities for communities, and establishing sustainable land management practices among Brazilian land owners. The 15 million hectares of restored forest also has the potential to sequester 200 million tonnes of CO2 annually, and will help restore water quality and quantity for the millions of people in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and so many of the surrounding communities.We are partnering with the NGO: SOLES4SOULS where we donate 1 pair of new sneakers for every 4 sneakers we sell.​Everyone deserves a good pair of sneakers. Every day children are prevented from attending school, adults are unable to work. Walking becomes unbearable. A new pair of sneakers provides relief in many developing nations around the globe, in times of disaster, and helps bridge the economic gap in developed countries.Sneakers keep people healthy, happy and thriving. In many developing nations, walking is the primary mode of transportation. Every day millions are exposed to unsanitary conditions that lead to diseases. These diseases may lead to sickness, even death. They also keep children out of school leaving them without an education and continuing the cycle of poverty.With your help, we can provide a life-changing solution: a good pair of sneakers. By cutting the middlemen we can offer you best quality products at unconventional prices! Our competition, in our opinion, sucks. We're going to ride our high horse over to the soapbox now:
 Well made sneakers look the same but with different logos on them depending on the brand and their prices are very high.
 Indie luxury brands with more unique designs are difficult to find and prices are astronomical. 
 Luxury sneakers are made of real leather and don’t pay attention to sustainability and the footprint on the planet.
 There’s not a single brand designing luxury sneakers with a.) best in class materials b.) being 100% compromised with the planet and the society c.) with no animal cruelty [ 100% vegan ] and d.) selling at an affordable price except Nøgen.

We make garments which are fashionable, versatile and make your life easier. </p><p>At initial glance, there is nothing which shouts technology. That's because we are a fashion first business and technology second. We believe that the product should shout style, fashion and function. </p><p>But our technology has a very clear purpose....to make your life a little bit easier.</p><p>Our garments help you out by enabling you to control your smart phone when it's not easy or convenient to do so, for example, when you are cycling.</p><p>The products in our range are Bluetooth enabled, allowing you to make or receive phone calls, play your favourite music direct from your phone or get alerts from friends. All this whilst you are on the go....and never having to retrieve a phone from a pocket.</p><p>Running or cycling. For lazy days in the park or  even on the commute to work, you'll always be in control of your device. </p><p> All the garments are washable too and we've made some of the technology removable so it can be charged either in or out of the garment via a USB.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468074500/Jacket_Campaign_pic_u0tu6e.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Why are we creating this brand?</b></p><p>We want to create this brand because we believe that we can make people's lives that bit easier through integrating our every day communication directly into our clothes, making wearable technology truly 'wearable'.</p><p>We believe that the technology we use in our everyday lives can be seamlssly integrated into the clothes we wear, without you ever feeling like you look like a robot,</p><p></p><p>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468021241/Hoody_Campaign_pic_i8iryv.png"" src="""" style=""width: 553.169px;height: 552px;""/></p><p>The Bluetooth technology has been designed specifically to be functional within our clothing ranges.

<p><b> Our Bluetooth technology...How it works...</b></p>
<p> Our garments contain a very simple bluetooth 3 button switch unit in the cuff, which is linked to the  microphone 'hub' and headphone jack point in the top chest pocket via a cable system which is sewn into the sleeve. </p>
<p>This system enables  you to effortlessly select music, make or receive calls and adjust your volume setting without having to fumble for your mobile phone. So  wherever you are, you will always remain totally 'hands free' and connected...to  your friends, to your music and to your device.</p>
<p><b> How do I care for my technology?....</b></p>
<p> Both the Switch unit and the Headphone/Microphone hub are removable, which  makes it really easy to prepare the garment for washing. Simply disconnect from  the cables remove from the inner pouches and off you go!</p>
<p> We have spent time ensuring that this is as easy a process as possible for you as you  don't want to mess around with leads, cables and devices!</p>
<p> We have also used non corrosive cabling, which is subtly integrated within the  garments. These cables, which attach the hub and the switch units together, never  need to be removed, so you can wash all our garments with confidence and never have to worry about things breaking or not working.</p>

<p><b> How do I charge the technology?</b></p>
<p>The Bluetooth unit can be charged using the supplied USB charging cable. Because  we have developed our technology to be removable, you can either keep the unit in  place and charge via a USB charge outlet on the garment, or you can remove the  switch unit and charge once removed (this might be when the garment is being  washed for example) </p>

<p>By getting into the market at this early stage we have the opportunity to establish our Brand name and become a trusted market leader at the forefront of this new wave of technological change.</p>
<div>
</div>
<p>We also know
we will face some manufacturing challenges through the early developmental
years of the brands growth. We are fortunate to have already secured good
international textile and electronics manufacturing and production. </p>
<p>However, as
the Brands product offer and range width grows and sales units increase, we
will need to identify more manufacturers and producers of both textiles and
electronics. This challenge will need to be met in order to ensure the Brand
remains scaleable long term.</p>

</div></div>","Our StoryHardwear is a wearable technology clothing brand. We make garments which are fashionable, versatile and make your life easier. At initial glance, there is nothing which shouts technology. That's because we are a fashion first business and technology second. We believe that the product should shout style, fashion and function. But our technology has a very clear purpose....to make your life a little bit easier.Our garments help you out by enabling you to control your smart phone when it's not easy or convenient to do so, for example, when you are cycling.The products in our range are Bluetooth enabled, allowing you to make or receive phone calls, play your favourite music direct from your phone or get alerts from friends. All this whilst you are on the go....and never having to retrieve a phone from a pocket.Running or cycling. For lazy days in the park or  even on the commute to work, you'll always be in control of your device.  All the garments are washable too and we've made some of the technology removable so it can be charged either in or out of the garment via a USB.Why are we creating this brand?We want to create this brand because we believe that we can make people's lives that bit easier through integrating our every day communication directly into our clothes, making wearable technology truly 'wearable'.We believe that the technology we use in our everyday lives can be seamlssly integrated into the clothes we wear, without you ever feeling like you look like a robot,   The Bluetooth technology has been designed specifically to be functional within our clothing ranges. It's easy to use, easy to charge and easy to remove. You just put it on, sync to your phone....and away you go!    

This
is where you come in!....

We at Hardwear are looking for funding so that
     we can get our Brand from a concept to full fat production and sales!
We have all our garments and accessories
     designed and ready to go, with prototypes and samples made, tested, loved
     and looking awesome!
We have conducted ‘wearer trials’ to ensure
     the garments are fit for purpose and operate the way we intended them too.
We now need investment to fund the next stage
     of our journey… and this is the part that will make the dream into a
     reality.
Our dream has a few stages of development and
     each is as important as the next, but only you can help decide how far we
     get...(no pressure!)
Your contribution will help us achieve our
     ultimate goal of being a significant online presence, a recognised brand
     and a market leading wearable technology fashion proposition!



What do we need?…..We need £30K for production costs, manufacture and business set up.
· 
If we reach our funding goal, we can go
into production with our 4 proposed garments (Jacket, Gilet, 2 x Hooded
Tops) in a selection of colours.
· 
We can also purchase the technology which will be
integrated into the garments and the mouldings to house the tech stored in the garments (a one off cost at production) and also the injection rubber switch covers for the Bluetooth tech in the garments (also a one off cost at production)
· 
This stage one funding will also enable us to  purchase some IT equipment and business set up, which will allow us establish
an online presence too so we can start to trade through an e-com website.

What you’ll get…..’Our Perks’…..(The Good Bit!)
Because we
are so confident that our products are….well, amazing, we are giving them as
our Perks. This way, you can receive, wear, get to know and ‘share the love’ of
a product you have backed!
For us at
Hardwear, it makes sense to offer you the chance to receive these items at a
discounted price, as a token of thanks for your contribution to our campaign.
Also, we are
offering you the option to buy the products in the form of ‘bundles’ too, so
you can choose a number of combinations of items, based on your investment to
the campaign!  Product DescriptionThe HW1 Hooded Top

building/construction and Emergency services.


· 
Collaboration with more traditional retailers to
produce ‘capsule’ ranges for 3rd party fashion designers or
retailers is also a very real possibility as this ensures the designers can trial innovative designs with a low risk and we can take advantage of being market leaders.


·  More long term, we are looking at developing a licensing model to sell internationally
through US and EU distributors, alongside the existing UK market


·  We would be aiming to secure manufacturing agreements with larger textile
and electronics companies in Asia so that production is maintained and can grow
at manageable levels.

 Hello everyone,My name is John Albrecht and when I created Kinesix more than a year ago, I wanted to make a difference and create products with the only purpose of making sports & activities easier.
I have a background in kinesiology and while studying kinesiology I had a lot of interest in biomechanics and decided to pursue in that field.
First of all, this campaign will bring a safer aspect during obstacle races and secondly, it will let people know what Kinesix is capable of create, all made in CANADA!
With your help, you will give the opportunity for a startup to grow bigger and to develop more local products in a near future.




Our first-ever product was especially designed to protect  the elbow & forearm while crawling in the mud or in the ground during an obstacle race (Spartan Race, Tough Mudder, Warrior Dash and so on...). The semi-compressive sleeve makes sure the sleeves will not turn around the arm and the removable plastic part attached with industrial Velcro© has the purpose of protecting the elbow & forearm against burises and scratches that could occur during an obstacle race.
Also, the plastic part will help protect the fabric from ripping itself, making the sleeves reusable for a long period of time.
For those who also run, because of the removable plastic part, the sleeves could be used only for traditional runs.
The logos on each sleeve are reflectives, making them visible and safe to use during low light conditions.
What We Need & What You Get
 We need 10 000$ CAD for  two reasons:



4000$ are needed to pay the second half of the industrial mold of the protection part;


6000$ are needed to start the production of the first batch (including the ones we'll send you) for the events Kinesix will participate as a partner (Défi Xtraining, Prison Break Race & XMAN Race).


That is why we created all sort of perks, just for You, your friends, your colleagues and even your family!!!Everything counts in the road to success, from small steps to bigger ones. You can support us or motivate yourself and/or your entourage to participate to an obstacle race with a new kind of product!All the perks here are made so you can enjoy our new product and use it for all your obstacle races! 
In any case, the funding goal is not reach you will still receive the sleeves!
Characteristics

Sleeves:- 80% Polyester, 20% Spandex Black matte fabric- Reflective logos
Protections:- Polypropylene (PP)









Patent Pending
  The Impact Kinesix wishes to develop 4 categories, Endurance, Intense, Obstacle & Pro. Our protective sleeves are our first product developped for our Obstacle category. 


Actually in development, we are also working on another protective gear for the knees & tibias, and so, by helping us we will be able to put this product on the market sooner than expected.
The other 3 categories are not yet produced, but with the help of our awesome technical clothing designer, we already designed complete clothing lines for each one. As Kinesix will grow in popularity, thanks to you, as we hope, it will give us the opportunity to take a step further and try to offer a complete set of clothes within this year and the beginning of 2016.

RésuméBonjour à tous,Mon nom est Jonathan Albrecht et lorsque j'ai créé Kinesix il y a plus d'un an, je voulais faire la différence et créer des produits avec pour seul but de faciliter la pratique des activités sportives.Je suis kinésiologue et c'est durant mes études que je me suis intéressé à la biomécanique et ai décidé de poursuivre dans ce domaine.Tout d'abord, cette campagne apportera un aspect plus sécuritaire pendant les courses d'obstacles et d'autre part, cela va permettre aux gens de savoir ce que Kinesix est capable de créer et de démontrer sa capacité de tout produire au Québec!Avec votre aide, vous donnerez l'occasion à une entreprise en démarrage de grandir et de développer plus de produits dans un avenir rapproché.Notre tout premier produit a été spécialement conçu pour protéger les coudes et avant-bras lors des passages au sol, notamment en rampant pendant les courses à obstacles (du style Prison Break, XMAN Race, Défi Xtraining ou encore The Mud Day...).

Kinesix souhaite développé 4 catégories, Endurance, Intense, Obstacle et Pro. Les manches de protection sont les premiers produits développés et font partis de la catégorie Obstacle.Actuellement en développement, nous travaillons sur un autre produit qui protègera cette fois-ci les genoux & tibias et ainsi, en nous aidant nous allons pouvoir sortir ce produit sur le marché beaucoup plus tôt que prévu. 
Les 3 autres catégories ne sont pas encore développées, mais avec l'aide de notre géniale designer technique, nous avons déjà conçus des gammes complètes de vêtements pour hommes et femmes en attente d'être produit. Lorsque Kinesix aura grandit en popularité, grâce à vous, comme nous l'espérons, cela nous permettra également de sortir nos gammes de vêtements avant la fin de l'année 2015 et au début de l'année 2016.





Risques & Défis
Bien que le produit ait été testé et amélioré avant sa production finale, il n'en est pas moins que pour certains d'entre vous, le produit ne paraisse pas à la hauteur de vos attentes. C'est pourquoi nous avons besoin de ""feedback"" de votre part, de connaître ce qui ne va pas et de nous aider à développer le meilleur produit possible sur le marché. Chaque cas sera évalué et nous vous contacterons en retour pour en discuter.




Les autres façons de nous aider
Nous sommes conscients que que votre aide sera différente d'une personne à l'autre, c'est pourquoi vous pouvez aussi nous aider en relayant et partageant simplement l'information à votre entourage ou à du monde dont notre produit sera pertinent.
Au nom de toute l'équipe de Kinesix, nous vous remercions du fond du coeur pour votre aide précieuse, parce que notre réussite dépend de VOUS!

</div><b>Nefarious Shoes</b> are wickedly affordable, trendy shoes for women. Our shoes are tailored to fit women with a shoe size of 7-13. Nefarious Shoes aims to provide quality shoes at an affordable price so that every woman may feel beautiful. What sets Nefarious apart from any other women’s shoes line is that we offer specialty sizes for women who would not be able to find attractive and trendy shoes otherwise. Each shoe will be equipped with padding in the insole to ensure maximum comfort all day. In today’s market, you can find beautiful flats and heels up to a women’s size 9. We will provide the same level of trendiness for women that are left out of that realm. Not only will we provide shoes that are physically appealing to catch the woman’s eye, we intend to offer our shoes at an affordable price so that the average teen, wife, or mother can feel beautiful when they step out in our shoes.<div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The funding we receive will be used for all startup costs, including: manufacturing, shipping/processing, building a website, and marketing. A portion of all of our proceeds go to foundations and charities that aid women and children. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>For years, we have seen disparities in the fashion realm for tall women and women with large feet. Does that make us any less of a woman? No! By helping Nefarious' campaign, you are helping us create a brand for women that are aching to feel beautiful when they step out of their house in one of our fabulous pairs of shoes. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>One of the risks we may find is with opening an online store. People shop in shoe stores in order to try on the shoes before they buy them.

<h3><b>WHAT DO WE DO?</b></h3>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
</div>
<p>One year ago, we were both working in the fashion industry. We were appalled by the amount of waste created, and the disregard for the environmental impact of the companys' practices. We decided there was only one way to make a change and help the planet, so we both quit our jobs to create the eco-friendly label- MAY &amp; HUGO. Now we design and produce swimwear <b>using first grade sustainable fabric.</b></p>

<div><br/></div>
<h3>WHY IS IT SUSTAINABLE?</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The fabric we use is made from <b>recycled</b> post-consumer waste. Items such as abandoned fishing nets, carpets, plastic bottles, clothing and more are rescued from oceans and landfill, broken down into raw material and re-spun into yarn to make the fabric. </div>
<div>This process not only reduces worldwide waste, but also requires <b>much less energy</b> than producing the yarn from virgin materials!      </div>

<div>We've designed and produced our first 2 collections in small quantities, which we've been selling through our website and in high-end markets, where we have direct contact with our customer. We now know exactly what our customer wants and we're ready to start producing bigger numbers and expand our range to include men and children's swimwear.</div>

<p>Along with our second collection, we released a capsule collection using a new and innovative double layered fabric, which allows styles to be<b> seamless, reversible and have raw edges.</b></p>
<p>This means no elastic which can dig in all the wrong places. These styles literally flew off the shelf so we decided to design an entire collection with this fabric. <span>We have sampled the collection and tried and tested each style on friends and family. Everyones feedback has been the same- <b>We have created swimwear that is amazingly comfortable, flattering, and functional!</b></span></p>

<div>We want to produce our third collection in bigger numbers, meaning we can keep the costs down and we won't sell out of popular styles so fast! <b>When you help fund this project, you can be amongst the first to get your hands on this unique, cutting-edge new swimwear. </b><br/>

</div></div>","IS SUSTAINABILITY IMPORTANT TO YOU?
MAY & HUGO is an Eco Swimwear label that uses and supports an intelligent and sustainable way to create products by recycling!

WHO ARE WE?

The concept label was founded in 2015 by Emily MAY Tait and Marcos HUGO Bello. Emily is from the small town of Bellingen on the East Coast of Australia. She studied a Bachelor of Design specialising in fashion and went on to work in the Australian swimwear industry after completing her studies. Marcos is from Tenerife in the Canary Islands. He studied audio visual communications and has worked in various roles within the photography and video industry. They are now based in Sydney, Australia.





WHAT DO WE DO?


One year ago, we were both working in the fashion industry. We were appalled by the amount of waste created, and the disregard for the environmental impact of the companys' practices. We decided there was only one way to make a change and help the planet, so we both quit our jobs to create the eco-friendly label- MAY & HUGO. Now we design and produce swimwear using first grade sustainable fabric.



Check out this collection in motion:     THE BEACHES '16 VIDEO LOOKBOOK

WHY IS IT SUSTAINABLE?

The fabric we use is made from recycled post-consumer waste. Items such as abandoned fishing nets, carpets, plastic bottles, clothing and more are rescued from oceans and landfill, broken down into raw material and re-spun into yarn to make the fabric. 
This process not only reduces worldwide waste, but also requires much less energy than producing the yarn from virgin materials!      






WHY SHOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE?





We've designed and produced our first 2 collections in small quantities, which we've been selling through our website and in high-end markets, where we have direct contact with our customer. We now know exactly what our customer wants and we're ready to start producing bigger numbers and expand our range to include men and children's swimwear.






Along with our second collection, we released a capsule collection using a new and innovative double layered fabric, which allows styles to be seamless, reversible and have raw edges.
This means no elastic which can dig in all the wrong places. These styles literally flew off the shelf so we decided to design an entire collection with this fabric. We have sampled the collection and tried and tested each style on friends and family. Everyones feedback has been the same- We have created swimwear that is amazingly comfortable, flattering, and functional!





We want to produce our third collection in bigger numbers, meaning we can keep the costs down and we won't sell out of popular styles so fast! When you help fund this project, you can be amongst the first to get your hands on this unique, cutting-edge new swimwear. 


PERKS







For the last 8 months we have put all of our energy and hard earned savings in to this project. We have even given up the comfort of a home and have been living in a van and working at public libraries or the homes of friends and family.

 


$20,000 will allow us to manufacture larger quantities, give us the funds we need to expand our range to include men's and children's swimwear, help with our marketing costs and to rent a work space.


If we don't reach our goal, all the funds will still go in to producing this collection and expanding our range, just in smaller numbers.



Facing The Facts


Did you know.. 


- there's over 76 million tons of global textile production annually and 20% of global production waste comes from the textile and apparel sectors  !!
- It can take more than 20,000 litres of water to produce 1kg of cotton; equivalentto a single T-shirt and pair of jeans !! 

We need your help to spread the word and help make the world a better place. We have a dream to not just create our own successful label, but to influence other labels to work more sustainably. We believe the fashion industry can be turned around. We want to promote consumerism that works on a circular economy, but to do this we need to get word out and grow MAY & HUGO.






Challenges 

Like with all projects, we know we have challenges to face. What can make swimwear difficult to sell all year round is that it's very seasonal. But while it's winter here in Australia, it's summer in the northern hemisphere! We've already started working with a PR team in NY to build our brand awareness up there, and drive more traffic to our website, where we ship worldwide!

<h3>Q&amp;A (Must read)</h3>
<div>
<p>Q: Why should I buy your product?</p>
<p>A:<b> Our carbon fiber leather money clip is unique, very light &amp; strong, and is quite possibly the most minimal and fashionable way of carrying your money (and cards).</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>Q: Where are they delivered from?</p>
<p>A: They are all mailed from South Korea - which should take anywhere from 1 to 2 weeks.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Q: Are there any additional charges?<br/>A: Buyer may be subject to import tariff of their respective country, but due to the price of the merchandise, event of taxation is highly unlikely. Those who order the distributor package may be subject to tariff. As much as we would like to, we cannot bear any tax burdens for you, so consult with your local tax offices on this matter in advance.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Q: What is the earliest date by which you can ship the product?<br/>A: Though we cannot promise anything, if everything works out quickly, we believe delivery can happen from late June to late July.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Q: How tight is the tension of money clip?</p>
<p>A: The money clip's tension is what took most of our development time. Tension is just right for fitting of anywhere between 1 to 10 cards. It may be very very slightly tight at first (though still completely fine for application), but over use tension very slight loosens becoming even more balanced.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Q: Carbon fiber is a strong material, why does it break?</p>
<p>A: Strong characteristic is relative to its thickness and overall mass. For its thickness and weight, our clip is very strong, but if you open the clip beyond parallel angle it is likely to lead to breakage.</p>

Cauden Moneyclip - part 2


Mission


We at Cauden believe in keeping things simple and straightforward.




This money clip incorporates a minimalist design, doing away with all of the clutter and uselessness that have become mainstays in contemporary products. 




Modest and reserved, we value a style that is at once direct and expressive. 

We want to create something that has never been seen before without throwing common sensibility out the window.
That is our mission here. That is our goal.






Featured by









Usage

Safely fitting as many as nine credit cards or about eighty bills (forty folded in half), our money clip was designed to get the job done and look good at the same time.




You can even mix your cards with your cash, keeping the bills in between the cards for ease of use. 
(*Note: In case of carrying both cards and cash, adjust the quantity accordingly to above guidelines. Going beyond these limits is discouraged and may lead to breakage.)



Design

The carbon fiber is visible just on the underside of the Italian vegetable leather, making this piece an outstandingly fashionable accessory.
Edge coated in the same color as the leather in incredible precision, our money clip follows our design principle - ""To stay modest, reserved and straightforward, valuing a style that is at once direct / expressive and to create something that has never been seen before.""







Weight 


Because carbon fiber is utilized, this money clip is incredibly light, weighing in at just six grams, which is the weight of a quarter and less than one-tenth of the weight of a traditional bi-fold money clip at around ninety grams. It's almost weightless!





(*Note: yellow background of above pictures is of the actual Italian vegetable leather used in money clip production)


Size
At 1.5 cm (up to 2cm with 10 cards) high, 2.1 cm wide, and 5.5 cm long [0.6in x 0.8in x 2.2in], this money clip will stay slim in your pocket.









Materials
Manufactured from 100% toray carbon fiber sheets and the highest quality Italian vegetable leather, this money clip is made to last.

Carbon Fiber

The reason for our choice of carbon fiber as the main material of our first product is because carbon fiber is known as one of the strongest materials relative to its weight.


Italian Vegetable Leather
 The Italian vegetable leather we use is of the highest quality that is renowned for its deep color, its supple texture, and its noticeable aroma.



(*Note: Above pictures are all of the actual Italian vegetable leather used in money clip production.)



Leather Protection
Our Leather is coated multiple times with bees wax and nano clear coat to prevent any scratches and water damage.




Components

Once you receive your product, within the carefully packaged box you will find one money clip in a holder along with one warranty card and four usage direction / contact cards (5 cards in total).


Extensive thought was invested even into our packaging - We are absolutely confident our product stands out in quality in every aspect.






Colors

Available in 8 colors, our money clip allows for incredibly unique and fashionable styling.

Obsession


We can say with complete confidence that our obsession with simplicity, uniqueness, and superior quality is simply unmatched in the marketplace. 
Our mountain of samples speaks for itself.

We always strive to produce the best handmade products, basing our reputation on simplicity, utility, originality, and durability. 



Plan
Right now, we are asking for your support. We are looking to raise an absolute minimum of $12,000, and with that capital, we plan on addressing four areas of cost saving: bulk discount on carbon fiber production, bulk discount on carbon fiber finishing, bulk leather purchase discount, and bulk leather craftsmanship discount.
Our plans will result in the following discounted rewards:

<b>ABOUT GIRLSTALKTOBOYS</b>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><a href=""www.girlstalktoboys.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""www.girlstalktoboys.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">girlstalktoboys </a> is a fashion brand for children aged 2-8 years. It
is owned and designed by Kelly Ekardt, an American mother based in London. She
believes strongly in the impact clothes can have on individuals and has always
been driven by helping people express themselves through what they wear.
Equally, Kelly knows through time spent in the industry how the clothes we wear
can impact society. <a href=""www.girlstalktoboys.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">girlstalktoboys </a>is designed and manufactured in the UK as
Kelly wants to help promote traditional industries in the community she lives
in and help everyone involved in her supply chain earn a living wage.</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457381016/fonq9qh9mtfzorrmprdj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Kelly studied fashion design in Missouri, US, before working
in various parts of the fashion business in America and London. Kelly suffered
a brain haemorrhage 4 years ago, while she was 30-weeks pregnant. Both mother
and daughter are fine now, but that was not always certain. Kelly realised
during these weeks and months that life can be short and it was time she
followed her dreams. It took over three years to regain her health, but she
finally decided to commit herself fully to creating a line of clothing that
would satisfy her creative ideals without compromising on production standards.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">MOTTO</b><br/></p>
<p>The motto behind girlstalktoboys (<i>‘Clothes speak louder than words’</i>) is inspired by Kelly’s daughter
imagination and her quirky sense of style. Over the past few years Kelly has
designed and sown the odd piece that she couldn’t find anywhere else. Clothes
for children should be practical but not at the expense of style. One way to
get around this is by placing compatibility right at the centre of the
collections’ design principles. Children (and parents!) should be able to pick
pieces from the wardrobe without having to worry what matches. Life’s too short
for that!</p>

This results in a deeply personal project. Kelly was driven
to embark on this journey by the realisation that life is too short not to
follow your dreams. Her ensuring fashion influences, including clean yet
playful Korean and Japanese styles, were combined with her daughter’s
imagination and the belief that what we wear impacts us as well as those who
made our clothes.

<p><b>PRODUCTION</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Having produced the first set of samples with the help of a
great network of North London creatives and craftsmen, Kelly now needs to put
her patterns into large scale production to satisfy the demand created at
recent trade shows and through the press. Because girlstalktoboys does not
produce in low-cost locations, a significant amount of funds is required to

</div></div>","ABOUT GIRLSTALKTOBOYS


girlstalktoboys  is a fashion brand for children aged 2-8 years. It
is owned and designed by Kelly Ekardt, an American mother based in London. She
believes strongly in the impact clothes can have on individuals and has always
been driven by helping people express themselves through what they wear.
Equally, Kelly knows through time spent in the industry how the clothes we wear
can impact society. girlstalktoboys is designed and manufactured in the UK as
Kelly wants to help promote traditional industries in the community she lives
in and help everyone involved in her supply chain earn a living wage.

Kelly studied fashion design in Missouri, US, before working
in various parts of the fashion business in America and London. Kelly suffered
a brain haemorrhage 4 years ago, while she was 30-weeks pregnant. Both mother
and daughter are fine now, but that was not always certain. Kelly realised
during these weeks and months that life can be short and it was time she
followed her dreams. It took over three years to regain her health, but she
finally decided to commit herself fully to creating a line of clothing that
would satisfy her creative ideals without compromising on production standards.

MOTTO
The motto behind girlstalktoboys (‘Clothes speak louder than words’) is inspired by Kelly’s daughter
imagination and her quirky sense of style. Over the past few years Kelly has
designed and sown the odd piece that she couldn’t find anywhere else. Clothes
for children should be practical but not at the expense of style. One way to
get around this is by placing compatibility right at the centre of the
collections’ design principles. Children (and parents!) should be able to pick
pieces from the wardrobe without having to worry what matches. Life’s too short
for that!
www.girlstalktoboys.com



This results in a deeply personal project. Kelly was driven
to embark on this journey by the realisation that life is too short not to
follow your dreams. Her ensuring fashion influences, including clean yet
playful Korean and Japanese styles, were combined with her daughter’s
imagination and the belief that what we wear impacts us as well as those who
made our clothes.




PRODUCTION
Having produced the first set of samples with the help of a
great network of North London creatives and craftsmen, Kelly now needs to put
her patterns into large scale production to satisfy the demand created at
recent trade shows and through the press. Because girlstalktoboys does not
produce in low-cost locations, a significant amount of funds is required to
achieve that. At the same time, the next collection needs to be designed and
finished in time for industry trade shows in London and Paris in June.
girlstalktoboys aims to raise GBP 20,000 to achieve genuine lift off. An
amazing amount of press has already been generated for girlstalktoboys, but the
nature of the fashion business means that this will only be rewarded in 6
months time.
Here’s how the funds will be used: 


31% will go into
producing the first girlstalktoboys seasonal collection (Autumn/Winter 2016),
which will hit the shops in July. 
35% will be used to design the next
collection (Spring/Summer 2017), which needs to be ready by the end of May. 
30%
of the funds will pay for all the marketing required, including a booth at
Paris Playtime, the leading trade show for children’s wear.  

Finally, 5% gets routed back to Indiegogo for
the use of this amazing website!


If not the entire amount we aim for is raised, producing AW
2015 will take priority. 
Please help Kelly realise her dream and ensure that one more
brand produces ethically, sustainably and locally. Clothes speak louder than
words!

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>Our biggest challenge is spreading the word about this campaign and getting people to order the shoe. We want to launch more sizes and colors, but in order to do that we need people to pre-order the shoe.

We have amazing production partners who we've worked with for years, and we've made shoes before, so we are experienced in the process. We are ready to move to production and we have everything in place to make it smooth. The only question still is how many sizes and colors we are going to be able to make and that's where we hope you'll join us in helping us bring this shoe to more people.</div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459885006/take-flight-ultra-find-your-style_gqvz25.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div>

Our Plan & Our Flex Goal
 We need your help to make this shoe better than ever! We are guaranteeing to launch the shoe this August (2016) in 2 inaugural colors and 9 total sizes!
The colors are: Red and Blue
The sizes are: 6.5-12.5




However, we want to bring this shoe to the world in more sizes and more colors including sizes 4-14 and a 3rd color Electric Green. From that we reach our flex goal:


Flex Goal: $30,000 (Add sizes 4-14 and Electric Green)If we reach $30,000 in funding then we are going to expand the shoes sizes from the current 6.5-12 to sizes 4 to 14 and we will add the 3rd shoe color, Electric Green.

1st Shoe - Summer 2014: After a complete redesign, 2 years of added work, and more than 70 changes and iterations we finally launched the Take Flight 1.0 in summer 2014.


2014-Today: The 1.0 has been embraced, loved, and enthusiastically worn by Traceurs worldwide! Here is a video of Take Flight pro Oscar Sanchez wearing the 1.0 in Spain!

For us, Parkour is our history and our medium, but we are much larger than that because our goals are all people driven as we work hard to bring inspiration, connectivity, and support to Traceurs, athletes and individuals worldwide. Every item we sell goes into funding that mission, and the larger we grow the more people we are able to impact positively.

A few facts....





All our profits go to support Traceurs/Freerunners, and Parkour community initiatives around the world.


We believe in growing together. We sponsors professional Traceurs in 13 countries all who receive endorsement salaries and or direct financial compensation for their work. 


We are focused on those who live by Parkour. All our products are designed by Traceurs and Freerunners!

We believe in community and growing together, and our vision is to keep growing and keep putting the community first. 

Four members of our international team that work throughout their communities to support Parkour through instruction, training, and inspiration.




Our Mission: To produce the highest quality athletic and urban apparel for customers worldwide, while providing people the inspiration to discover their own potential through movement. 
Our Method: Helping the Parkour community grow through developing our global brand that supports Traceurs, Parkour communities, Parkour gyms, and Parkour organizations in all corners of the globe.
Beyond Parkour: We believe that the Parkour style of clothing, footwear, and life is the total style that people everywhere can benefit from. That’s why we are calling the Ultra Shoes a “The World's Most Versatile Parkour Shoe.” Regardless of where you come from, we think you will love the Ultra shoe as well as our growing line of footwear, apparel, and other products.



Risks & Challenges  Our biggest challenge is spreading the word about this campaign and getting people to order the shoe. We want to launch more sizes and colors, but in order to do that we need people to pre-order the shoe. We have worked really hard to bring this amazing shoe to the world, and we fully believe people are going to love it which is why we back it with our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. We have amazing production partners who we've worked with for years, and we've made shoes before, so we are experienced in the process. We are ready to move to production and we have everything in place to make it smooth. The only question still is how many sizes and colors we are going to be able to make and that's where we hope you'll join us in helping us bring this shoe to more people.

These products, such as the adhesive patches, cannot be removed once applied and do not last very long. They do not allow the skateboarder to wear it for any other use than to skateboard since the shoe is altered and not very visually appealing. They do not protect all areas of the shoe where damage and wear is prevalent. Also, the glue/rubber cement product  is not removable once applied. This product takes time to dry before the rider can wear the shoes to skateboard. Although it can be placed on most areas where the damage is prevalent, it is very messy and does not provide the best protection. It is a very temporary fix to the problem.

This overshoe is made of a flexible material that conforms to the shoe in all areas needed in order to protect specific portions of the shoe while conforming to the shoe's shape.  The overshoe adds additional cushioning and traction to the heel and ball of the shoe. The middle of the overshoe is constructed in a way to allow the overshoe to be stretched to fit and conform to a very broad range of shoe sizes and not just to a few size ranges. The upper and the sole also have added traction in the form of raised areas or other forms of traction to allow the ""grip"" of the shoe to the skateboard for the efficient execution of tricks and stunts. The overshoe also covers the laces area on the front of the shoe protecting them from damage where it is prevalent. </p><p></p><figure style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/698/155/02e32b9d493561618998fdc50d070402_original.JPG?w=456&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1465515203&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=b83384b4e902203a07d60a18008e16d4"" src="""" style=""width: 451.55px;height: 397px;""/> </figure><p></p><p>Once the skateboarder has finished using the product, it can be removed and saved to be reused at a later time.

These ""patches"" are affixed to the shoe with adhesive glues or other types of adhesive means.  Another product is a type of glue or rubber cement that is applied to the area of the upper portion of the shoe that dries to form a barrier where the wear is prevalent.                                The current products as stated above are semi-permanent fixes that are mostly not removable from the shoe. These products, such as the adhesive patches, cannot be removed once applied and do not last very long. They do not allow the skateboarder to wear it for any other use than to skateboard since the shoe is altered and not very visually appealing. They do not protect all areas of the shoe where damage and wear is prevalent. Also, the glue/rubber cement product  is not removable once applied. This product takes time to dry before the rider can wear the shoes to skateboard. Although it can be placed on most areas where the damage is prevalent, it is very messy and does not provide the best protection. It is a very temporary fix to the problem. These products are not removable nor are they reusable.  Our local tester, Stevie Gandy (photo above) says that he loves the HOUKIE. According to Stevie, he has better board control, can do flick tricks more efficiently and he doesn't even feel the HOUKIE on his shoes because they are so light.The HOUKIE is a removable and reusable flexible overshoe that is placed over the shoe which will cover all areas of the shoe that are damaged during skateboarding. This overshoe is made of a flexible material that conforms to the shoe in all areas needed in order to protect specific portions of the shoe while conforming to the shoe's shape.  The overshoe adds additional cushioning and traction to the heel and ball of the shoe. The middle of the overshoe is constructed in a way to allow the overshoe to be stretched to fit and conform to a very broad range of shoe sizes and not just to a few size ranges. The upper and the sole also have added traction in the form of raised areas or other forms of traction to allow the ""grip"" of the shoe to the skateboard for the efficient execution of tricks and stunts. The overshoe also covers the laces area on the front of the shoe protecting them from damage where it is prevalent.  Once the skateboarder has finished using the product, it can be removed and saved to be reused at a later time. The construction of this overshoe is such that it can be used on any type of shoe therefore making any shoe style a ""skateboarding"" shoe. There is also areas of the HOUKIE that will allow for different company logos who wish to sponsor or license the product.                     We are hoping to have the Houkie last a minimum of 4 months so this will save tons of $$ on shoes. We are currently working with a local rubber chemist to come up with the best custom rubber compound that will be flexible but durable enough in addition to keeping the ""board feel"" for the skateboarder. Feel free to ask any questions about the Houkie. We have gone through 4 design changes so far and have finally fixed all the bugs in the design.  Now we need to get the proper custom rubber compound to make these perfect.  We have also located a manufacturer here in the USA so this will be American Made and we will be able to guarantee the consistency and quality of the HOUKIE. We are ready to get the final mold created and start production.  Below is a picture of the design phases from beginning to present..... Here are a few design possibilities for future releases.....
So far, we have done all of the development work, spent the money to get molds and samples tested so we could get this product created and out there for you guys to protect your shoes.  We are in the final stretch and are so close to having this completed!  This is where your support will push us to the finish!!  We are moving the manufacturing of the HOUKIE to the USA!!! The money raised will be used for the creation of the final design mold and obtaining the custom rubber compound and for the first run of the product. The HOUKIE will retail for $30 to $35 a pair when released. We hope to have the product to market for sale in September 2016.BACKER LEVEL REWARDS:$5 pledge or more:

<p>My name is Drew Weaver and I'm an entrepreneur with an engineering and IT background.  I've always had an affinity for fashion and one day I decided to fuse both of my passions to create Q'Vani™.  A Luxury Footwear Brand that utilizes patent-pending technology to instantly repair heels.  I developed this technology because I'm a stickler on my appearance and forgot to repair my shoes one day before an important meeting and my shoe repair specialist couldn't help me out last minute.  So, I wasted time and money buying a new pair.  I knew there had to be a more cost-effective way and when I realized there wasn't one, I created Q'Vani™. Contributors to the Q'Vani™ campaign will be a part of making history by changing an industry that has not seen structural innovation since inception.  Since we're fully manufactured in the US, your contributions will allows us to create American jobs and even better it gives America an opportunity to become a dominant force in the footwear industry once again.</p>

<p>Over three years ago, Q'Vani™ was just an idea.  One that the Founder was quite passionate about.  He started by sketching on a scratch piece of paper, then it led to many late night self-brainstorming moments to hash out the details of the technology needed to successfully accomplish a task so revolutionary. While working full time as an engineer, he used personal funds to bootstrap the entire process.  Once the prototype was completed, he learned from past business failures that he had to let go of his full-time job to give his passion a fair chance at succeeding.  After much contemplation and mental wrestling with fear, he marched into his bosses office and took a blind leap of faith.  </p>
<p>With nothing in the way to distract him from his goals, he embarked on probably the hardest thing he has ever done in his life...not to mention raising two children at the same time. The road has been arduous, yet rewarding. </p>

<p>Thank you for your
interest in our Wear Art, Give Sight campaign! We are beyond excited to finally give
our supporters the chance to directly connect themselves with the children they
are helping. Through new techniques, we’ve been able to take the colorful and
creative art of the young students we help and bring it to a new line of
sunglasses. For every pair sold, fifty percent of the revenue will go to support
these children. </p><p>We see so much potential, so much creativity in our students. We want to share their talent and the power of their imaginations with the world, and give them a way to help the community they come from. We love these sunglasses, wear them every day, and hope you will love them too. Through our partnership with Wdoo, we've also been able to create some amazing, exclusive perks available to people who support the campaign, please check 'em out!<br/></p><p>Last, we are thrilled to have you join us on our social mission, while adding something unique and fun to your style.

<p>While we have been able to raise a portion of the costs
needed to help students this year, we are still short of reaching our overall
goal and being able to fully support all of our partner schools. With your
help, we’ll be able to work in all 120 partner schools, deliver eyeglasses to
all students in need, and be able to train and educate all key stakeholders in
the community, including local teachers and parents.</p>
<br/><p></p>
<h2><b>Who are we helping? </b></h2>
<p>This year, we aim to help Baoshan and Derong counties in Yunnan, China, and all of the elementary and middle schools there. </p>
<p>Our work is currently focused in the poorest regions of
rural China. Children there face adversity in every element of their education.
Many live without guardians and have parents that live a thousand miles away to
work to raise money and support their children. Classroom sizes are often 50 to
60 students, where students are taught en masse, and many drop out before the
age of 12 to go farm or work in factories.  </p>

<h2><b>Sunglasses + Art </b></h2>
<p>We want to give you the opportunity to connect with
the students you are helping. Through our partnership with the designer eyeglasses
company Wdoo, we have been able to bring the art and creativity of the students
we work with and apply it directly to a pair of sunglasses. The colorful and
unique artwork on each pair of glasses was actually created by the young
artists of Yunnan province. When you go out in public, your glasses will have
something no one else’s does – a story of creativity and inspiration that
started all the way on the other side of the world. </p>

</div></div>","Hi there,
Thank you for your
interest in our Wear Art, Give Sight campaign! We are beyond excited to finally give
our supporters the chance to directly connect themselves with the children they
are helping. Through new techniques, we’ve been able to take the colorful and
creative art of the young students we help and bring it to a new line of
sunglasses. For every pair sold, fifty percent of the revenue will go to support
these children. We see so much potential, so much creativity in our students. We want to share their talent and the power of their imaginations with the world, and give them a way to help the community they come from. We love these sunglasses, wear them every day, and hope you will love them too. Through our partnership with Wdoo, we've also been able to create some amazing, exclusive perks available to people who support the campaign, please check 'em out!Last, we are thrilled to have you join us on our social mission, while adding something unique and fun to your style. Wear Art, Give Sight, Change the World. Best wishes,The Education In Sight and Wdoo TeamWhy glasses?
*Statistics for rural Chinese students
 

Globally, over 150 million low-income students suffer from
uncorrected poor vision, and in China, as many as 30 million rural students
suffer from the same problem. 
With 80% of all classroom learning being visual, students in
these classrooms who can’t see, can’t learn, and lose any chance at an equal
education. 




Giving free glasses is one of the most powerful tools we
have for combating educational inequality around the world. 




Why do we need your support?




While we have been able to raise a portion of the costs
needed to help students this year, we are still short of reaching our overall
goal and being able to fully support all of our partner schools. With your
help, we’ll be able to work in all 120 partner schools, deliver eyeglasses to
all students in need, and be able to train and educate all key stakeholders in
the community, including local teachers and parents.

Who are we helping? 
This year, we aim to help Baoshan and Derong counties in Yunnan, China, and all of the elementary and middle schools there. 
Our work is currently focused in the poorest regions of
rural China. Children there face adversity in every element of their education.
Many live without guardians and have parents that live a thousand miles away to
work to raise money and support their children. Classroom sizes are often 50 to
60 students, where students are taught en masse, and many drop out before the
age of 12 to go farm or work in factories.  







Sunglasses + Art 
We want to give you the opportunity to connect with
the students you are helping. Through our partnership with the designer eyeglasses
company Wdoo, we have been able to bring the art and creativity of the students
we work with and apply it directly to a pair of sunglasses. The colorful and
unique artwork on each pair of glasses was actually created by the young
artists of Yunnan province. When you go out in public, your glasses will have
something no one else’s does – a story of creativity and inspiration that
started all the way on the other side of the world.

</div></div>","Introducing Tacuin



Tacuin has created an eco-friendly notebook with a soft cover, a smooth writing paper and with all the comfortable feel of a luxury notebook. So whether you are
an avid writer or have always dreamed of writing
more, today is the day to join our Tacuin notebook movement! 
We invite you to help us bring our
dream to life by contributing to Tacuin – in
return, we're offering a range of exclusive rewards, together with our deepest
gratitude. We’ve been working on this campaign for a while now and we are very excited about this opportunity to reach out
to you. 






How You Can Help
For us to bring Tacuin into life, we need your support!
Your generous funding will help us get things started. It will help us cover the costs of further development, manufacturing and production. More importantly you get the chance to be one of the first users of Tacuin. We are committed to continuous improvement to give our costumers the best possible solutions.



How We'll Use the Funds

The funds generated from this campaign will be entirely used for the first large-scale production of the notebook including packaging, shipping as well as the Indiegogo, Paypal & Payment processing fees.

More about the Tacuin Project

This is where we started to envision Tacuin and all the possible benefits we could bring to people!









When
reviewing these benefits, we feel inspired and certain that this project was much needed to be created. We hope to reach a large market of people in need of an easier way to write. Our mission is to take care of every funder,
supporter and customer with the utmost respect and care. We feel this will be the key to our growth.



Eco-Friendly
Quality and sustainability are the principles that guide our project, 
from the conceptual design of the notebook to the manufacturing, 
distribution and sale. The utmost attention has been 
dedicated to choosing the materials. For this reason all our direct 
partners (such as our paper manufacturer and bookbinders) bear the FSC® Chain of Custody certification and are based on a shared commitment to 
environmentally friendly high quality products.



In addition to our commitment to the FSC®, the selected paper used in our notebook holds the following ecological certifications:

FSC® certified 

Elemental Chlorine Free
Acid Free
Selected Secondary Fibres
Heavy Metal Absence
Long Life Paper
EU Eco-Label (EU Marguerite)


 


  




Paper Love
Attention to every detail and passion for quality is important to us in order to enhance the characteristics of each Tacuin notebook. We offer a premium quality product that infuses each notebook with a touch of Italy.
The cover owes its velvety touch to a carefully manufactured, 100% 
biodegradable, flocked paper based on eucalyptus pulp which fascinates 
with its special tactile feel. With its smooth and luxurious finish our Tacuin collection ensures a high quality experience and a particularly soft 
texture allowing for an extraordinarily comfortable and relaxed hold.



Tacuin in the Press
""The most important thing is to love and share our love and that’s what you are doing by sharing and giving us something to caress and love."" Matthew Lesko (New York Times Best Selling Author & Entrepreneur)





What people are saying about Tacuin

""It touches me deeply to see how much love, care and respect is put into the Tacuin notebook. It shines through in all aspects of the process of making your dream come true... now it is easy to love, care and respect whatever I choose to write or draw here."" S. Boye Petersen


""It is simply beautiful and pleasant, nourishing and calming to even just view."" S. Lee



""A brilliant way to benefit."" A. Naim


 

""Thank you so much for this opportunity to write a review for this great cause. May all beings benefit."" J. Sethi 


""I was immediately drawn to Tacuin after the first glimpse. It is humble to the eye and luxurious to the touch. My first thoughts were of quality, then of sustainability. Tacuin is a beautiful mix of both."" C. Horstkamp

""This is such a soulful, beautiful item, so much more than a notebook. I would write my deepest heart wishes and desires and treasure it forever. The care in every detail gives it a life that elicits reflection, awareness and creativity."" S. Lee




Timeline
We aim to send all pre-order incentives by November of 2015.

September 2015: Indiegogo campaign ends 
October 2015: Production & assembly of notebooks
November 2015: Begin packaging and shipping of small orders
Late November 2015: All large orders (10+ notebooks) packaged and shipped



Shipping
Please include $10 if shipping to the EU, and $18 if shipping outside of the EU. Please note that the shipping costs remain the same up to 5 notebooks. 



The Impact



As a global sustainable 
development project we take very much to heart our social responsibility. Our 
corporate culture is reflected in the knowledge, skills and awareness of
 each member, and every detail is carried out in a clear and consistent way, in an 
environment full of enthusiasm and a disposition towards the common 
good. 
We strive for a balance between economic development and
 social-environmental responsibility based on respect and reliability, and our desire to have a beneficial impact on people, society and the environment. 
Through your contributions we are able to support Balanced View, a non-profit organization 
committed to empowering people all over the world to see their strengths
 and talents, and contribute them for the benefit to all.



Risks
 
We've already sourced our necessary materials and our direct partners such as paper manufacturer and bookbinder and we are confident to be able to deliver our orders quickly as soon as our
project is funded. Most of our manufacturing process is done by hand, so there could be some delays with one of our manufacturing partners or shipping providers.
In the event of unforeseen delays in the
manufacturing and shipping process,
we will be 100% transparent. We will do
everything we can to ensure that all orders are shipped by the end of November 2015.



Other Ways You Can Help
Any way that you can help is greatly appreciated. These campaigns do the best when they get momentum right from the start. The more activity we get the higher the chance our project will be featured on Indiegogo's Homepage. If you know any influential people please let them know about our campaign. 
If you would like to support our project but you are not able to contribute, please spread the word and share Tacuin  with your community, friends and family.

Many children walk all day to collect infected water from swamps or rivers and carry it home to their families. Not only do they become very ill from the water, but the time spent laboring keeps them from going to school. Installing well systems will help people in these villages be dramatically healthier, but also bring these children back to school where they belong to receive primary education.</p>

Children are like blooming flowers: They will bloom into their full potential with love and guidance from others...

When we walk through a valley and look out at the blooming
 fields, we simply stop and admire their beauty for a while. As we examine each flower closely, we can easily notice its unique beauty.  I believe that children are like blossoms - they are to be noticed, cherished, and cared for in order to bloom into amazing people.
After having two children six years ago, my desire to cherish and give my best to them led me to start creating garments that are simple, comfortable and stylish. My husband, Adam believed in my vision and eventually this passion became a company, “Tiny Blossoms, Inc.” I believe my line of clothing can not only bring children a sense of peace and comfort in a busy world, but also smiles and joy to those around them.  
We need your support to finish Spring & Summer 2015 Collection!

In order to make my collection available in the market, cover all of expenses from preproduction, production and other expenses, and prepare for next season, Adam and I would like to raise $23,000 through this Indiegogo campaign. I think it's possible to accomplish this goal with your support!

Your donation will go towards:

Pre-production: fabrics, pattern making, grading & marking
Production: cutting, sewing and packaging
Notions: trims, buttons, and other supplies
Preparation for next season’s collection

     Tiny Blossoms Wants to Give Back!






Tiny Blossoms believes in helping children and is pledging 10% of its profit to bring hope to those in need.  In March 2011, the tsunami from The Great East Japan Earthquake Disaster wiped out the northern part of Japan. Around 1,800 people lost their lives in the city of Rikuzentakata, Iwate where my sister’s family lives. Many children became orphans. A portion of our pledge will go to help rebuild a public library in the city to give hope and encouragement to those children. 



Tiny Blossoms, Inc. will also donate to a non-profit organization called PEACE Water:No Thirsty Child to install well systems in various Rwanda villages. Many children walk all day to collect infected water from swamps or rivers and carry it home to their families. Not only do they become very ill from the water, but the time spent laboring keeps them from going to school. Installing well systems will help people in these villages be dramatically healthier, but also bring these children back to school where they belong to receive primary education.
Lastly, to support local employment, all of our garments are sewn in America.
I believe every child has unique talents and can “bloom” when given love, care and guidance. Your support will make a huge difference for these children’s lives. 
Would you be willing to be a part of launching our exciting project? Thank you so much for watching this video, learning about Tiny Blossoms and supporting our campaign. Remember, not only will you receive wonderful perks, your donation is tax-deductible.

Co-Founder of Tiny Blossoms, Inc.

That's when I looked down the route of phone skins, traditionally printed on vinyl using solvent ink, then skillfully applied to a phone, the vinyl skins were very cool but needed expensive equipment, drying time, and didn't really offer any protection. I needed this product but done in a different way. I was already very familiar with a printing process called sublimation so what I needed to do was find suitable materials to create a gel skin. Again I hit a brick wall and found the process to be too laborious and not cost effective. We eventually found a type of polymer that could be printed, great we thought we'd cracked it... We were wrong. We then had to spend 2 years developing a unique formula of resin that could be hardened in advance to allow the gel skin to be printed on demand in minutes.

<p></p> <p>We sell alpaca clothing for the outdoor enthusiast.</p>
<p>We started with alpaca base layers after learning about the natural lightweight warmth alpaca provides. We wanted to try some out in a base layer suitable for outdoor recreation. Unable to find any, we decided to make some ourselves. </p>
<p>Our alpaca base layers perform wonderfully in insulation, strength, and moisture wicking. We expanded our offerings to alpaca field pants and accessories and have now designed The Ultimate Field Coat, pairing alpaca's lightweight warmth with traditional waxed cotton for a long lasting versatile coat that gets better with each use. </p>
<p><b>Materials:</b></p>
<p><i><b>Alpaca:</b></i> Lightweight, warm, and strong. We source our alpaca from Peru and the        inner plaid lining is made with 100% of the finest alpaca, manufacturer by a trusted partner who has been with us since our first product launch. </p>
<p><i><b>Waxed Cotton:</b></i> Traditional waxed cotton sourced from long standing waxed cotton producer; British Millerain. </p>
<p><i><b>Sewing:</b> </i>Final sewing and packaging will be completed with one of our local manufacturers</p>
<p>And that's all there is too it! Two fabrics, some buttons and zippers, and one sewing facility. </p>
<p>Now we need some help. We are trying to raise $9,000 for the alpaca fabric that will be the lining for these coats. </p>

 We sell alpaca clothing for the outdoor enthusiast.
We started with alpaca base layers after learning about the natural lightweight warmth alpaca provides. We wanted to try some out in a base layer suitable for outdoor recreation. Unable to find any, we decided to make some ourselves. 
Our alpaca base layers perform wonderfully in insulation, strength, and moisture wicking. We expanded our offerings to alpaca field pants and accessories and have now designed The Ultimate Field Coat, pairing alpaca's lightweight warmth with traditional waxed cotton for a long lasting versatile coat that gets better with each use. 
Materials:
Alpaca: Lightweight, warm, and strong. We source our alpaca from Peru and the        inner plaid lining is made with 100% of the finest alpaca, manufacturer by a trusted partner who has been with us since our first product launch. 
Waxed Cotton: Traditional waxed cotton sourced from long standing waxed cotton producer; British Millerain. 
Sewing: Final sewing and packaging will be completed with one of our local manufacturers
And that's all there is too it! Two fabrics, some buttons and zippers, and one sewing facility. 
Now we need some help. We are trying to raise $9,000 for the alpaca fabric that will be the lining for these coats.

Why Indiegogo?     We are an independent online business and we sell our products direct to the consumer. Which means savings for our customers,  but it makes it harder to make the minimum requirements for manufacturing. In order to make our manufacturing minimums we need a little help with the alpaca fabric.      Alpaca is considered a luxury and rare fiber typically found more in high end fashion. However, it's natural attributes of lightweight warmth, moisture wicking, and strength make it a great choice for outdoor lifestyle apparel. We want more people to be able to experience the warmth and comfort alpaca can offer, and by being and Idiegogo supporter you can get even more savings and be one of the first to receive the coat. Fulfillment Schedule
We are asking for $9,000 to place our first alpaca flannel order. Our manufacturer in Peru takes four months to make the alpaca fabric so to get us going we will be placing two fabric orders.

All other perks will be shipped in September. 


Things to consider
Manufacturing:  We have established relationships with our manufactures and while most of the time things go smoothly, there is always the possibility for unforeseen delays. Please know that we will do all that we can to get you your perk on time.

<p>Let me inspire you with how Dragonfly was born. I love designing clothes for women, I spent 14 years successfully creating collections for companies in New York City. It came to a point where I felt a change was coming. My father was quite ill in Bali and my mother needed help. I had just met someone from Australia, and I have also been looking to have time for volunteer work, so everything seemed to be pointing in that direction. One crazy, fine, sunny day in the concrete jungle of Manhattan I took a break from work to call my mother. I had made  up my mind to take a leap of faith, and be with them and eventually work on my own collection to be inspired through the Asian culture which I love, to find my passion. I asked her not to speak until I was finished, I was afraid I would lose the courage. As I was coming to the end of my adrenaline fueled monologue I uttered, ""all I need now is a name for my brand"", at that very instant, through the thickness of traffic and the throng of people whizzing by me, through the maze of grey skyscrapers, a big Dragonfly found me and hovered next to me for about as long as I looked at it in awe, and spoke into the phone... ""I have found the name"". <br/></p>
<p>I checked its symbolism not short after. It became my mantra..</p>
<p>Transformation, adaptability, creativity, delving
deeper into the emotional realm, of wisdom and lightness... finding personal
authenticity. Elegant
and graceful, a Dragonfly accomplishes its objectives with the utmost
simplicity and strength. It is an inspiration to behold. This is the concept; of being beautiful, luxurious, easy to wear clothing as
well as embodying a unique and environmentally sensitive lifestyle. We
encourage building long-term sustainable growth opportunities and of the
preservation of local art forms. A better fashion future while encouraging giving back to the community. “Dress to express, Live to express”.<br/></p>
<p>I've started up this campaign in the hopes to help achieve
the completion of my first full collection. For me this is no
ordinary project as it represents my journey from the time I shifted direction in my life.<br/> </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Living in countries as diverse as Indonesia, India,
Kenya, Argentina, Switzerland and Sri Lanka, Dragonfly finds inspiration through a wide
variety of cultures, religions and traditions gaining insight into their communities.
Creatively inspired, thoughtful pieces from journeys across the globe,
distilled in Indonesia, embodying local traditions while continually searching
for ways to reduce our impact on this earth and its resources. We are
committed to being a responsible, honest, community oriented and empowering Brand. The Dragonfly Collection
makes use of organic cotton and bamboo textile, combining innovative
inspiration from across the world with a loving touch of local craftsmanship
for the non-conforming individual.</p>
<p>The wonderful contributions made by you will give the brand some breathing space to move forward with production and the fashion show, It would mean the world to us if we complete our goal!!<br/></p>
<p>And I could not have done any of this without the love and encouragement of my biggest fan, my mother Ana Maria Rohrer, who, sadly, passed away June 11th 2015. More reason to finish what we both started with so much love. R.I.P. &lt;3</p>

Revolutionary new view to artificial
intelligence
At this moment
the world’s technology of the creation of artificial intelligence has two main
directions:
· 
Modeling the neural connections of the brain
· 
Creating large storage of the information about everything
We think that nօne of these give the solution. We
have chosen another way. We are modeling the human brain behavior – from
biological functionality till abstract intelligence. We have imaginationhow the brain adapts to the environment,
how processes the data, how creates abstraction, etc… And we are modeling and
developing this behavior. It’s an extremely new
direction and we are following it. We believe that the result will approve the
electivity of our strategy.

What we have nowNow we have
simple intelligence with simple association behavior. It’s included in AIA
v1.0. And we have ArmMen v1.1 client application which works with AIA v1.0.
ArmMen provides the human voice as a single channel input data to AIA and provides
the result to the user.Find it at: https://www.treeveloper.com
What we will have in the next step
· 
We will have the new version of AIA with multichannel
input/output and simple association intelligence. It will be able to determine
the kind of input signals, remember and react.
· 
We will have the new version of ArmMen which will provide the

to the user. AIA will be able to determine the objects (view, name, behavior,

What we will have in the future
· 
We will have extremely generic AIA for any kind of environment
(body) and with large specter of intelligence. 
· 
We will have the robot ArmMen with AIA inside. ArmMen will be a
good friend and assistant to many-many people. He will be able to save lives,

About the projectThe design and
development was started in 2013. Past years were full of testing, discussions
and development. The number and difficulty of the algorithms that need to be
implemented is impressive. 
To develop our
ideas we need more resources – a team of smart and creative developers. Now we
are growing a team. We have a goal and we are moving forward.
We know that
our project will change the frozen stereotype about artificial intelligence. And
your founding will help us to reach this goal faster.Find us in Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/treeveloper",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

My name is Sophie Chang. I am the founder of SOCOL shirts. This shirt is not your average shirt. As a fashion designer for women's clothing, I for long have wanted to start a line for men. I didn't know what particular piece of clothing I wanted to focus on until I noticed most of the shirts were not as comfortable as others. In fact most of the shirts were either too casual or too dressy when it came to style. After several months of research and testing here I am, the  SOCOL brand came alive. A design that is not only great in versatility, comfortability and stylish but also Eco-friendly and made in Los Angeles. After finding out that 40% of the LGBT youths are homeless, I thought what would be a greater way to give back to a community who not only faces civil discrimination but, sexism and a breach of civil rights. Immediately, that's when I decided to dedicate this line of men's shirts to this community.</p><p>                                                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474414410/bteagc3brbaw9azzdott.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474272082/mj2kjtmoothokwaogmjd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>1.)</strong> <strong>Versatile</strong>- In style, Comfortable, Dress up dress down, Multi-color option. Versatility is important when it comes to the SOCOL brand.

My name is Sophie Chang. I am the founder of SOCOL shirts. This shirt is not your average shirt. As a fashion designer for women's clothing, I for long have wanted to start a line for men. I didn't know what particular piece of clothing I wanted to focus on until I noticed most of the shirts were not as comfortable as others. In fact most of the shirts were either too casual or too dressy when it came to style. After several months of research and testing here I am, the  SOCOL brand came alive. A design that is not only great in versatility, comfortability and stylish but also Eco-friendly and made in Los Angeles. After finding out that 40% of the LGBT youths are homeless, I thought what would be a greater way to give back to a community who not only faces civil discrimination but, sexism and a breach of civil rights. Immediately, that's when I decided to dedicate this line of men's shirts to this community.                                                                 1.) Versatile- In style, Comfortable, Dress up dress down, Multi-color option. Versatility is important when it comes to the SOCOL brand. We wanted to create one shirt for all, along with comfortability and stylish color options to choose from. So, we designed our one slim fit look for all. Wearing the shirt brings out your inner personality.2)Eco-Friendly- Anti-bacteria, Non-shrinkage, Bamboo fabric, breathable. With our shirts being made from Eco-friendly bamboo materials, SOCOL believes in bringing more green house products to the universe.3)Made in Los Angeles- Handmade and Tailored. Our revolutionary SOCOL shirts are made in the Fashion Capital city of Los Angeles, creating local jobs to build a stronger economy.                                                                                          4) For a greater cause- 5% of every sale made will be donated to the LGBT Community.

 The Mission
Seven out of the 15 most carcinogenic chemicals known to man are used on conventional cotton, and the amount makes up 25 percent of the worldwide total use for chemicals. 
When I learned all this information--I knew I had to create a new line of clothing to disrupt what was happening in our society.

The public does not know the impact conventional cotton could be having on their health in the long run. 

Simply Chickie Clothing's mission is to help more people realize the importance of CLEAN WEAR for their overall health and wellness by creating clothing that truly benefits our bodies while also revolutionizing the industry. 






What We Need & What You Get


We are striving to make organic cotton clothing more available and affordable to the masses. Unfortunately, organic cotton is currently very expensive and this campaign will help broaden awareness, hopefully resulting in lowering the price, so we may provide wonderful clothing to more people. 

We need $15,000 to grow Simply Chickie's exposure and add a companion adult t-shirt line.

“Violets are Blue”—a skin care line, out of New York, free of parabens, sulfates, alcohol, or synthetic fragrance and “The Optimist Co”—a chemical free cleaning product line from Cape Cod.

I will be using a company that is voted the top fifty eco friendly trace back to seed t-shirt company based here in the U.K. I need to raise three thousand pounds to pay for five hundred organic cotton &amp; organic bamboo cotton t-shirts with the trademarked logo Deckdolly. Another five hundred pounds for 2,500 mail bags that are bio-degradable and the rest is to cover postage and packageing. This label is designed for music artist's, DJ's and clubbers worldwide. The t-shirts are made in a windmill factory in India, people working at this factory get a good decent wage and decent working hours. The t-shirts are then sent to The Isle of Wright herein the U.K. to be screen printed by hand with eco friendly fabric paints. I will be selling the t-shirts at forty pounds each once the label is up and running. I will be posting out a t-shirt to every person who donates/funds twenty pounds each. My Deckdolly label is also making one little black dresses. Each one only one made each. The idea is so that when girls go clubbing they won't need to worry about meeting another girl in the same dress who may be younger or slimmer. Each dress is made by hand in London. I hope to grow my business to employ other fashion designers and pattern cutters here in London and export goods from the U.K. The materials for the dresses will be remnant fabrics that were samples used at fashion shows. New materials that are reused instead of sending to landfill. I hope to raise awareness of sustainable fabrics and the impact on the environment making cheap t-shirts has.

<p>Having had my Personal Training business for over nine years, training with athletes as young as five, I knew the market was crying out for a dedicated fitness wear brand for little people.</p>
<p>The statistics behind childhood obesity are staggering: <strong>obesity costs the UK over £50 billion every year, and over 41 million children under the age of 5 obese.</strong><br/>It was clear that more needed to be done to encourage children to get fit and active from an early age.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>There was a definitive need to bring a trusted and safe fitness brand for children that encourages and embraces a healthy lifestyle- and so Munchkins Muscles was born.</strong></p>
<p>It was soon after I started this tough but incredible journey, that I discovered the devastating facts behind the fashion and sports wear industry- more specifically under <strong><a href=""https://www.greenpeace.org/international/act/detox/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Greenpeace's Detox My Fashion Campaign</a>. </strong>Their findings were quite literally terrifying. <strong>The fashion industry is the second biggest polluter in the world, second only to oil, with ""fast fashion"",  toxic chemicals and mass textile waste literally poisoning eco systems and water ways across the globe.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Lets not beat around the bush here- the facts are in black and white for all to see. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The fashion industry is TOXIC- toxic to the environment, toxic to the people who make the clothing and toxic to those who wear it.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sadly so few people know about the horrors that the fast fashion industry is causing- rivers are awash with deadly harmful chemicals, aqua marine life is dying, skin conditions and illnesses directly caused by these chemicals are rife, landfills are overflowing with discarded clothing made from artificial fibres that is unable to break down, and the world is literally choking under what is the second most polluting industry in the world. </p>

Changing Lives We are going to offer customizable engraving service on the watch’s back in the future, have a dash of personality and we truly believe the perfect finishing touch is you and special messages for loved ones.
We are two guys with a lifelong love of watches. Over the years, we got frustrated with what the top dollar watch companies were knowing they only cost a fraction of the price to make.One day we were joking about making our own watch brand, which at the time seemed like an impossible adventure, until one day early in 2018 we decided to go for it and started researching.

<p>My name is Stewart Bell, I'm the main composer &amp; keys player for progressive rock band Citizen Cain. I'm currently working on a solo project - entitled The Antechamber Of Being - which includes a trilogy of lucid dreaming themed concept albums, 2 storybooks, an EP plus, accompanying art-books. So far I've completed two of the albums, a storybook and an art-book and I am currently working on the EP and the new storybook. As you can imagine, producing this type of material involves a lot of work and funding is always essential in order for the project to continue smoothly. To that end I have designed some t-shirts featuring; the artwork from my project plus; 5 classic album covers from Citizen Cain's back catalogue (artwork by vocalist and bass player Cyrus.) You can view the different designs in the video above or the images below.</p>

<h3><strong>Ankara and African Wax Print Fabric</strong></h3>

<p>It's the name of a popular fabric worn by many Africans. Ankara commonly known as “Ankara prints”, “African prints”,”African wax prints” “Holland wax” and “Dutch wax”, is a 100% cotton fabric with vibrant patterns. It is usually a colorful cloth and is primarily associated with Africa because of its tribal-like patterns and motifs.</p>

We take the elements of African creativity (bold colors, patterns, abstraction) and combine it with the structure, design, and comfort of Western apparel to make a truly distinct and identifiable clothing line that stands out from the traditional aesthetic and feel of modern clothing.
    This project is close to our hearts because it represents a bigger message that we believe is important to the current state of the world. Combining the best parts of cultures, as humans, has lead us to great discoveries and new frontiers. Afrikans clothing is made for everyone (men+women) and represents the beauty that's conceived when we combine our strengths!  


What We Need & What You Get
     We've broken away from the steps of traditional retailers by empowering our customers to help in the creation of new clothing pieces. We source the finest materials Africa has to offer, to provide you with different fabrics, as well as various styles of ""Everydaywear"" designs to create new original pieces. Our summer line consists of everything from short-sleeve dress shirts to beautiful blouses. 

 
 
We've come along since we began this journey, from sourcing material directly from africa to prototyping new clothing designs in the US.  We're excited to share with you our new clothing line Afrikans!
By contributing to one of our perks today, you'll receive a one of a kind clothing piece that has a great message, and helps you STAND OUT! You'll also help us achieve our dreams of bringing african designs and creativity to wider audiences!
Ankara and African Wax Print Fabric
What is ankara?
It's the name of a popular fabric worn by many Africans. Ankara commonly known as “Ankara prints”, “African prints”,”African wax prints” “Holland wax” and “Dutch wax”, is a 100% cotton fabric with vibrant patterns. It is usually a colorful cloth and is primarily associated with Africa because of its tribal-like patterns and motifs.

For our 1st Indiegogo Campaign and our Inaugural Afrikans Summer Collection we have a limited run of 30 different fabric designs and over 300 pieces available!   

 
Each one of our Clothing Perks are unique to you because our initial fabric options are limited in availability.

Back in the early mid-2000's, his mother couldn't afford designer clothing from the mall because she was a single mother and had to pay bills. Terrance used to get picked on for not having those types of clothes. We have a vision of where our brand will be one of the top brands of the world but affordable to people who lack finance. The Red Pineapple came to Terrance in a dream back in 2015. Red pineapples are the original pineapples are only found in the lower Caribbean and South America. Its a Royal Fruit! Fun fact is that the red pineapple has spikes in the crown and fends off things that try to mess with it. It has flowers that blossom out the crown as well! Another fun fact that is that it grows its own berries on top of the crown as well that you can eat! This will explain why Terrance came up with Ripe Brand Clothing and Royal Blossom Commonwealth listed below. How does this Pineapple relates to God? The Pineapple is connected to the mother plant and it never stops being ripe as long as it stays connected to the mother plant. Once disconnected, it will spoil fast. When connected to God you never stop growing unless you disconnect with God. (you will stop being ripe and blossoming).</p><p><strong><i><u>Chief Executive Officer </u></i></strong></p><p><strong><i><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510882555/b1lsvputsucq7rdvo4hm.jpg"" src=""""/></u></i></strong></p><p>Donta Joe is a native of Virginia and also a graduate of Bethune-Cookman University.

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>What is the backpack made of?</strong></p>
<p>The Flashy Backpack is made from 3 major components:</p>
<ol>
<li>Industrial grade felt for the main pieces of the backpack - Industrial felt is super strong and tear resistant, water resistant, flame resistant, dirt resistant, and most importantly, tantrum resistant.</li>
<li>Nylon straps - We use the same nylon material used in car seat belts for the top handle and straps between the shoulder strap and main backpack</li>
<li>LED light strip - The light strip is a standard off-the-shelf component. We've developed special straps within the small compartment to hold it securely in place. We've also made a special hidden pocket inside the small compartment to hold the battery pack.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What are the patterns and how are they made?</strong></p>
<p>Good question. We went through a lot of pattern ideas before settling on 4 fun and inspiration patterns that we think will fit most people's lifestyles. They are Sandy, Party, Chill, and Solar. Each pattern is expertly laser cut by large, complex, industrial machines that go bzzzzzzzzz bzzzzzzz bzzzzzzz! </p>
<p><strong>How big is the backpack?</strong></p>
<p>The large compartment is roughly 17"" x 11"" x 4"" inside, which is comparable to most standard backpacks. The small compartment is a bit smaller, 8"" x 5.5"" x 2.5"". </p>
<p><strong>Are the LED lights programmable?</strong></p>
<p>We like the way you think. They are currently pre-programmed, but we do have plans for a Flashy Backpack 2.0 with accompanying mobile app that will customize the LED lights, change traffic lights to green, and call Superman!</p>

 0) Don't worry about it, you could also receive the high quanlity REVERSION even though the campaign can't reach the goal because it's a flexible funding ! 1) The website (WWW.LIN-BLUE.COM) is under construction...... 2) Could you please do me a big favor to share this product/link to your friends via your social networks while reading this project, maybe someone else love this watch, and it will be a big help for this campaign, thank you very much!
3) [Important update !!] The 3rd version of test samples were arrived today(2/22), the font of 'REVERSION' and it's width/hight are more close to the artwork, and the upper/movement part is slimmer/thinner than the 1st/2nd version, it near perfect. Please refer to the update 1.
 4) The environment resistance test result was updated ! 5)  [Very important update !!!] Some good people/friends leave us the valuable suggestions/advices after they reviewed the campaign, they thought this watch will be better if it could be more easy to read the time for someone need to know the time immediately in the emergency moment. So we have updated a new design of easy-reading version for you.
We know that there are so many watches come to be sold in the market every month, every week, even every day, Especially the smart watch/wear.With the rapid development of science and technology, our world is changing so fast that we can't catch up with it.However, in our world, everything will Return to the origin which it comes from in the final, and nothing can change this law becaue this is the essence of everything!So, the conclusion comes out: The real fashion --- is the 'CLASSIC' !Because only the 'classic' will never be eliminated.We have traveled our minds back to the origin of 'time', and rethinking it's essence, then, we found out a new concept --- BACK TO TOMORROW.The evolution watch is coming, we named it --- REVERSION!!!It means: NO SMART, BUT FASHION !For our first collection, 3 types are offered for you to choose from:(Updata to the easy-reading version ! )As the time goes by, our minds have been set to be clockwise to anything if is related to the watch or clock’s rotation direction.
But we have forgotten one thing that there are so many instances which also indicated the existence of the anti-clockwise in our world and our life.
For example: the direction of earth rotation, the direction of running in the Athletics, the direction of spiral stairs you go upstairs, or the direction of your reading method(from left to right, from above to below), even the direction when you draw a round on the paper, and so on.
All these examples listed above are acting by the anti-clockwise direction.
We found this concept, and used it...
Therefore, an anti-clockwise watch---‘REVERSION'---was born.
And it means --- BACK TO TOMORROW.





Now, let's have a look at some pictures at first !



The 3rd version of test sample: 

1) The font of 'REVERSION' and it's width/hight are more close to the artwork.
2) The upper/movement part is slimmer/thinner than the 1st/2nd version, it near perfect.

Without your support, we can do nothing!
Without your support, we can’t share our idea with you!
Without your support, this cool product could not be known by the world!
ZG.Lin, and Bluewins.Y, the founder of LIN+BLUE. We want to design a series of special watch from now and share them to you.We love this work so much which we can’t separate from, because the product designing has been a part of our life. While designing the reversion, the well friendship was established between us, even the two families. We hope to keep this relationship forever, and design more something cool!
We are so confident that you will be satisfied with it when you receive the reversion. And with your support, we could promote the next generation which the appearance design was almost finished, and we promise to you who will have bought the reversion could get a discount for our next watch.







There are always risks and challenges when promoting a project because it takes a lot of works to finish the product. However, we have the very confident to make it. Why? Because Shenzhen is the most famous city in producing watch, there are more than 50% of the world's watches were made in Shenzhen every year.  And we have more than 10 years of experience in our each fields.
ZG.Lin: More than 10 years of experience in industry design and original painting design.
Bluewins.Y: More than 10 years of experience in watch design, have designed more than 50 models of watch, and quite familiar (personal relationship) with lots of watch suppliers.









So, we are so confident that we can make this watch not just for the special appearance but more for the quality and durability guarantee.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Elizabeth Jackson. I am a mother of one precious little girl, and I quickly realized that every parent has their own preferences and needs when it comes to baby clothes. My daughter grew so fast, she was in 6-9 month size by the time she was 3.5 months! I wished for an easy way to keep up with her, and be able to get clothes to fit my needs and preferences without having to leave the house!</p>
<p>That's why I designed the Bamboo Baby Box. You'll get the items you need for a price you can afford. Get brand new items with the tags still on them, or go for the budget option and go for used items. Send items back in to get a credit towards your next box, even items we didn't send you!</p>

<p>Spuds™ is a pair of shorts that combines innovative materials, next level design, with a look that will make you stand out without making a scene. </p>
<p><strong>Built for all elements of your life.</strong></p>
<p>From working out, to going out, and everywhere in between. We do not classify Spuds™ under a certain category of short, since they do so much. Let them be the best training shorts you ever own, the best hiking shorts you ever use, and still look great with a button down when it's time for a night out on the town.</p>
<p><strong>Gravi™ Pocket System...No more dropped phones.</strong></p>
<p>Putting your phone on the ground, having it fall out of your small pockets... you've seen it, you've encountered it. Devices are getting larger, but pockets are staying the same. We decided to change that. With the Gravi™ Pocket, your phone (even large iPhone and Samsung plus models) is secured against your right hip. This allows you to run, squat, bench press, lay weights on your thigh, and do any other intense physical activity, all while having your phone protected and feeling like it isn't even there.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504026094/meecdosvljgeoz7is3ny.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Gym shorts are great for working out, but not going out, and you certainly wouldn't wear your favorite chino/cargo shorts while working out. We have created a pair of shorts you can throw on in the morning, train during the day, lounge in the afternoon, and still look great when its time to go out.</p>

<p>Many shorts have media pockets, but they all kind of suck. They are either designed for phones from 5 years ago, or are in locations that make no sense.</p>
<p>The Gravi™ Pocket is designed to hold the largest of phones (even iPhone and Samsung Plus models with cases), all while securing the device against your right hip. We found this location to be perfect for every physical activity we tested. You can run, squat, bench press, leg raise, bike, hike, and anything else, all while keeping your device secured. The Gravi™ Pocket is also designed to utilize the waistband of Spuds™ to bear the weight, so it feels like it isn't even there.</p>

</div></div>","Spuds™ is a pair of shorts that combines innovative materials, next level design, with a look that will make you stand out without making a scene. 
Built for all elements of your life.
From working out, to going out, and everywhere in between. We do not classify Spuds™ under a certain category of short, since they do so much. Let them be the best training shorts you ever own, the best hiking shorts you ever use, and still look great with a button down when it's time for a night out on the town.
Gravi™ Pocket System...No more dropped phones.
Putting your phone on the ground, having it fall out of your small pockets... you've seen it, you've encountered it. Devices are getting larger, but pockets are staying the same. We decided to change that. With the Gravi™ Pocket, your phone (even large iPhone and Samsung plus models) is secured against your right hip. This allows you to run, squat, bench press, lay weights on your thigh, and do any other intense physical activity, all while having your phone protected and feeling like it isn't even there.

Gym shorts are great for working out, but not going out, and you certainly wouldn't wear your favorite chino/cargo shorts while working out. We have created a pair of shorts you can throw on in the morning, train during the day, lounge in the afternoon, and still look great when its time to go out.


Many shorts have media pockets, but they all kind of suck. They are either designed for phones from 5 years ago, or are in locations that make no sense.
The Gravi™ Pocket is designed to hold the largest of phones (even iPhone and Samsung Plus models with cases), all while securing the device against your right hip. We found this location to be perfect for every physical activity we tested. You can run, squat, bench press, leg raise, bike, hike, and anything else, all while keeping your device secured. The Gravi™ Pocket is also designed to utilize the waistband of Spuds™ to bear the weight, so it feels like it isn't even there.
Say goodbye to putting your phone on the ground, floppy armbands, or worrying about it falling out of your pocket. The only thing that will be on your mind is your next step or next rep.





Looks light your favorite cotton twill shorts, but performs better than your best athletic shorts. The body material is made from an advanced nylon and spandex twill blend that provides a soft cool feeling. The polyester pocket material is extremely durable and lightweight, while being quick drying and moisture wicking.


The C6 DWR (Durable Water Repellant) coating implementing into Spuds™ is more environmentally friendly and designed to help keep you dry. Whether you're caught in a rainstorm, spill your favorite sports drink, or drop your coffee during your morning rush, rest assured you can still move at the speed of life.

Diaper+ makes one of them just a bit easier by letting you know—clearly and accurately—when a diaper needs to be changed.</p><p>Why need the Diaper+? Most diapers now come with a “wetness indicator” that lets the caregivers or parents know when a diaper needs changing. These wetness indicators only work when you can see them, so you have to remove your baby or elderly relative’s pants to see if the diaper needs to be changed. That’s uncomfortable for you and them. If your baby or elderly relative is asleep, you run the risk of waking them to check and that’s often not a risk you want to take.</p><p>Adult diapers are supposed to protect the dignity of our elderly relatives. Removing clothing to check a wetness indicator robs them of the very dignity the diapers were intended to protect.</p><p>Allowing your baby or elderly relative to wear a wet diaper for an extended period isn’t an option. It will often lead to diaper rash and cracked skin, causing discomfort and pain and potentially leading to infection. To minimize the risk, diapers should be changed as soon as they get wet so they’re always protected by a clean, dry diaper.</p><p>Caring for a baby or elderly relative isn’t just hard work, it’s work that causes stress and worry.

There are two versions, one for a baby, one for an elderly relative and it’s easy to choose the version that’s appropriate to your situation.If you’re leaving your baby or elderly relative in someone else’s care for long periods, you can link your phone to that of the person caring for your baby or elderly relative and get every notification they do so you can ensure your loved one is receiving the quality of care you expect. The app also features a tracking system that records:•    Each time your baby or elderly relative pees•    Each time the diaper was checked•    Each time the diaper was changedData is kept for three weeks so parents and caregivers can look for trends and adjust their schedule accordingly.You can also use the Diaper+ app to track how many diapers have been used so you’ll always know how many are left and when you need to shop for more. You’ll never be caught without a diaper and you’ll have a better idea of how many diapers you’ll need to budget for in the coming month. The android app is ready to ship and the iOS app is coming by January 2018. The system is available in English, Traditional Chinese, and Simple Chinese.",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

Time to be a part of the winners square



 
One night, Raj, had a dream whilst fast asleep...
Kronos, the Greek god of time, visited him floating atop a cloud with Frank Sinatra singing lightly next to him. As “Strangers in The Night” played lightly in the background, Kronos looked at Raj and said...


“Give the mortal realm something provocative to keep track of the seconds in the minutes, the minutes in the hours, the hours in the day...” 

Raj, as you could probably expect, was a bit confused by Kronos’s ambiguous advice and asked that Kronos not speak in riddles.
Kronos was offended at first but then realized he was being a bit pretentious (not unlike so many watchmakers littering the internet).
So, Kronos repeated his advice, this time in English...

“Raj, construct a watch from the finest materials the world has to offer at an extraordinarily reasonable price and make the timepiece square.”


Raj’s eyes grew wide as the full force of the idea struck him like one of Zeus’s thunderbolts. At this moment, Kronos drew a large fiery square in the sky with his pointer finger and disappeared, leaving the burning square behind him.
Two years have passed since this fateful dream and today the mortal realm has the provocative MC, the world’s best square-faced watch, designed from industry-leading materials, at an incredible price you simply cannot beat.
A line of watches built with the precision of aircrafts, missiles and bulletproof glass. 

When Raj set out to build the very first MC, he refused committing the cardinal sin so many watch brands have done in the past (and are still doing today), finding a white label product and slapping a logo on it.
We won’t name any names (you know who you are), but some very prominent watch companies don’t actually use their own designs, instead, they use templates of other cheap white label designs and mark them up.

While creating a custom design from scratch required more work and certainly more time, Raj knew that he wanted to build the MC with the best materials he could find while ensuring their price point stayed well below “luxury brands”.


 
He scoured the globe for the best materials and came up with a provocative but oh so stunning square-faced design that gave the MC an edginess you’d have to run your fingers along to fully comprehend.

Building MC has been a long time coming, we have been on this journey for almost 2 years. The reason we waited so long is because we didn't want any complications in the manufacturing process. We sourced the best materials and worked with many manufacturers to negotiate pricing to make MC affordable.
The only challenge will be to get watches made and shipped to you within that 60 day window.. To execute this, we have already pre-paid for certain materials that typically take longer to produce & we will be communicating with our factory to send us constant updates..

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't help back MC by purchasing a watch, no biggie! Shout us out on social media..

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Imagine this: You’ve finally ordered a lipstick online that you’ve been seeing ads for on your Instagram feed for weeks. You’re so excited when the package arrives, but once you try the lipstick on, you realize that the color looks nothing like in the pictures. Now, you’re stuck with yet another product that you never use and can’t return.</p>
<p>This is the harsh reality of shopping for makeup online.</p>
<p>Our very own co-founder, Anisha, experienced this herself when she bought the lipstick shade “Boy Bye” from the Kylie Cosmetics website, and she’s not alone. Shoppers of all different skin tones have been constantly frustrated by false expectations and inaccurate depictions of makeup on social media and retail sites. They deserve better.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>That’s why we’ve designed swatchcandy, the solution that every makeup user has been looking for. With our app, you can see lipsticks on real people with skin tones like yours so that you don’t have to second guess your next makeup haul.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>We created a mobile app for makeup lovers to find their perfect colors by using the world’s largest library of makeup swatches to curate photos for each user’s unique skin tone. We do this using swatches, or samples of makeup applied to the skin to show off its color and texture.</p>
<p>swatchcandy was founded by Sabrina and Anisha, two women of color with backgrounds in Industrial Design and Computer Science from Georgia Tech who were tired of the difficulty involved in finding reliable and representative images of makeup online. In just 6 months, we turned our class project into a startup, after being selected into an incubator program through Georgia Tech in June. After interviewing over 150 people of all skin tones about their frustrations in the makeup buying process, our team discovered that a majority of makeup shoppers have trouble finding products that complement their skin tone, even with all the online resources they have quick access to.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>With swatchcandy, we are revolutionizing the online makeup shopping experience by providing a resource for people of all skin tones. Right now, we have a searchable database of over 50 lipsticks being shown on at least 10 different skin tones per product, so a user can see how it will look on a skin tone similar to their own before deciding to make a purchase. All of our images are unretouched and color corrected to show up to a 98% accurate representation for the makeup being photographed.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Since this June, we have started developing a version of swatchcandy that will be compatible with both Android and iOS platforms. Here’s what our prototype currently looks like.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We need your help to continue development on the app so that we can provide the best experience for our users and they can purchase makeup with the confidence that they deserve.</p>
<p>Here’s our vision for swatchcandy - when you first download the app, you’ll take a picture of your skin. Now, each time you find a product that you’re interested in, swatchcandy will show you a photo of how that product looks on a skin tone and type similar to your own. You can search for any product in our database by brand or product name, or you can even browse through the popular products we carry. You’ll also be able to buy products directly through swatchcandy, so you don’t have to keep switching between apps to find out how you can get your hands on a product.</p>
<p>After we reach our funding goal, this is what we hope to have developed for the initial launch in December.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>After December, we will continue to grow our swatch library with an even more diverse range of skin tones, as well as products from both popular and small — but amazing — makeup brands.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With your help, we can continue growing the world’s most diverse database of makeup swatches to include hundreds of brands, thousands of swatches, and all (yes, ALL) skin tones so that you never have to add another product to your makeup graveyard again.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The lack of diversity in the beauty industry is finally getting the attention it deserves, and swatchcandy is at the forefront of empowering people of all skin tones. Through our design and technology skills, we are creating a solution that tackles our customers’ pain points and helps them gain the trust they need to make the right purchases, despite false advertising and unrealistic industry standards. With your donation, we can make online shopping fun, reliable, and inclusive.</p>

All of our images are unretouched and color corrected to show up to a 98% accurate representation for the makeup being photographed.

 
Since this June, we have started developing a version of swatchcandy that will be compatible with both Android and iOS platforms. Here’s what our prototype currently looks like.
 

 
 

 
We need your help to continue development on the app so that we can provide the best experience for our users and they can purchase makeup with the confidence that they deserve.
Here’s our vision for swatchcandy - when you first download the app, you’ll take a picture of your skin. Now, each time you find a product that you’re interested in, swatchcandy will show you a photo of how that product looks on a skin tone and type similar to your own. You can search for any product in our database by brand or product name, or you can even browse through the popular products we carry. You’ll also be able to buy products directly through swatchcandy, so you don’t have to keep switching between apps to find out how you can get your hands on a product.
After we reach our funding goal, this is what we hope to have developed for the initial launch in December.
 


 
After December, we will continue to grow our swatch library with an even more diverse range of skin tones, as well as products from both popular and small — but amazing — makeup brands.
 
What We Need & What You Get
With your help, we can continue growing the world’s most diverse database of makeup swatches to include hundreds of brands, thousands of swatches, and all (yes, ALL) skin tones so that you never have to add another product to your makeup graveyard again.
Here’s how we will use the funding:

 
Mobile Development Includes: Paying our developers for their contributions
Marketing Includes: Paying for content promotion through social media
Producing Swatches Includes: Hosting swatch parties and using advanced software to produce, crop, and edit photos for maximum skin tone accuracy
Operational Expenses Includes: Maintaining website content, domain, and developer accounts
Legal Includes: Banking and Indiegogo fees
 

The Impact
The lack of diversity in the beauty industry is finally getting the attention it deserves, and swatchcandy is at the forefront of empowering people of all skin tones. Through our design and technology skills, we are creating a solution that tackles our customers’ pain points and helps them gain the trust they need to make the right purchases, despite false advertising and unrealistic industry standards. With your donation, we can make online shopping fun, reliable, and inclusive.

<p>You support will enable us to refine the business by building clientele through marketing. We're looking for contributions to obtain packaging for our shoes and complete a website that is fully functioning with features specifically designed for e-commerce.</p>
<p>A portion of the funds will be used to create awareness and passion for the brand through pop-up shops, networking events across the U.S, and advertisement. So far, we’ve obtained a small inventory from world renowned brands, but with your help we can increase our shoe catalog. For the future, we hope to get high-end shoe designers involved directly; therefore, the more people who are using the service, the more designer brands available for rent. </p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Better than the rest.</h2>
<p>What sets us apart from other designer rental services is that we plan to incorporate an app that allows woman to sell and rent their own designer shoes to woman within their community.   This will allow others to obtain luxury shoes within 24 hours or less of payment as well as give other women the opportunity to have their own small business.  The app will make luxury footwear more accessible and create a fashion sharing culture around the world.  </p>
</div><div>

<h2><strong>Women are only wearing 1/4 of the shoes they’re purchasing. </strong></h2>
<p>I’m especially motivated to grow the company because, with each new customer, we’re eliminating wastefulness of shoes that would’ve likely been used very little or not at all.   I am driven to make these goals a reality when I think of the millions of women that would benefit and all of the material we could conserve. When the benefits are so tangible, I feel it is my obligation to make it happen. It's time for a fashion revolution. Help make it a reality!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<p>1. There is a challenge in building up inventory because we don’t want to have too much on our hands with no one to buy it. It will be on us to ensure that we have enough customers committed to pre-sale so that we don’t end up in a ditch too deep to climb out of. </p>
<p>2. Lastly, the finalizing of the service generally takes ~12 months of time to create, but can vary based on a number of factors including large quantity of shoes to ship, the amount of employees executing shipment, etc.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>Although there will be many risks and challenges to renting high end footwear we are confident in our ability to achieve our goal of becoming one of the largest designer shoe rental services and we plan to take production slow to ensure that you receive the best experience possible with the brand.  That may mean tweaking, adding, or removing small features.  </p>

My impression is that bras are designed with the 14 to 35 age group in mind.With the help of a patternmaker, the prototype has taken a year to perfect, and it is the bra I have always wished I could buy. How this bra is different Cut higher under the arms to eliminate underarm bulge or side boob (as it is affectionately known).Broader band which adds comfort and support as well as minimizing the under band roll.Broader wings and a hook and eye closure.
