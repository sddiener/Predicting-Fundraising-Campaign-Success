<p>We are raising funds to launch a nomadic artist
run centre exclusively for young and emerging artists living in Toronto.
Younger Than BeyoncéGallery will program monthly pop-up shows in spaces throughout
Toronto, including short art exhibitions, artist talks, and a
performance art night celebrating emergent and experimental practices. </p>
<p>In 2009 the New Museum in New York held its first triennial of emerging artists called ""Younger
Than Jesus<b>,</b><b>”</b>showcasing work by artists younger then 33. The show was controversial
because it focused on a generation that has been defined by their habits of
consumption rather than production. Five years later, Younger Than
Beyoncéis
being born, a nomadic, D.I.Y.<span>  response
to this landmark exhibition. </span></p>
<p>We are starting a temporary project gallery for artists
at the beginning stages of their career in order to foster a community and to
support artists at the same stage we are. We hope to not only showcase work by
artists at the early stages of their careers but to adopt
programming in response to the situations affecting younger artists in
Toronto. </p>
<p>Younger Than Beyonce is a gallery for emergent and
experimental art practices. We are creating a discursive space for critical
conversations and risk-taking through new configurations of audience, artists,
and community.</p>
<p>As young artists in Toronto we are searching for
a place in our cultural landscape. Toronto has a thriving arts scene for
established and mid-career artists but it is a difficult place for young
artists to get recognized. In the past, young artists would have held their
first shows in artist run centres and other grassroots arts
organizations, but as these institutions have become more established
they have become more focused on programming big names in Canadian
art.<span>  Few galleries are looking towards
the next generation with curiosity and anticipation. Younger Than </span>Beyoncé explores
what our generation is making by giving young artists space in which to experiment,
take risks, and build a professional practice. We need your support to give
these artists a platform to be seen, discussed, and celebrated. Co-directors
Marjan Verstappen and Humboldt Magnussen are looking for emerging experimental
art practices in all mediums that are representative of must-see work by
younger artists.</p>
We are without grants or institutional or
corporate sponsorship because we are still getting ourselves off the ground.
The rent for the space and for the show will be largely made up of
contributions to this Indiegogo campaign, and our fundraising events.
By contributing to this campaign you will help create a professional space
dedicated to young artists and curators.

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>We are asking for $3,000 which is enough for us to pay rent, buy lightblubs, promotional materials (posters), snacks, paint and building supplies, and <b>pay our artists.</b> By supporting our campaign you make it possible for a empty unused space to become a lab for creation and experimentation.

</div>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>As a teenager in art 
school, I once asked a visiting artist what you had to do to make it in 
the art world.  He said ""with that I can't really advise you, the art 
world changes so much between generations, the best people to ask are 
your peers.""  <p><span>For
 me, it was a revelation.  As young artists, we don't have to ""make it"" 
in the art world so much as we have to create our own.  We don't have to
 fit in to anything, we need to create our own institutions that support 
our artistic goals and interests. That's why Toronto needs Younger Than 
Beyoncé Gallery. </span></p>
<span>After
 basic training, young artists have to support their own art career for 
about ten years before they become recognized ""emerged"" artists.  During
 this time, most artists have to support themselves through alternative 
jobs and make art in their spare time (and mostly in their bedrooms.)  
As recent MFA graduates, we spend our days out hustling and we are in a privileged position to create a new arts community in Toronto.  Most 
young artists stop creating artwork because they become disillusioned 
with the art world and feel they will never be acknowledged for their 
hard work.  At present, in Toronto, there are many, many talented young 
artists who are not being represented by the mature gallery scene.  
Younger than Beyoncé provides a much-needed platform for artists 
starting out in Toronto. </span><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Our greatest risk is that we will burn out financially and physically. We don't expect to make any profit from this, but if this campaign is successful we will be able to pay our artists and ourselves. <br/>

<p>Make some noise and spread the
world. If you want to see more space for emerging artists. By sharing
this campaign you will greatly help us by not only letting your friends know

SoapUp®
is the new soap holder. It is designed to hold the soap above the sink. A new
concept for all places and for all people: able bodied,
children or disabled.An Italian patented product, 100% Made in Italy.
ITALIAN
SoapUp® è il nuovo portasapone che sospende la saponetta sul lavandino, un nuovo concetto pensato per tutti i luoghi e per tutte le persone: normodotati, bambini, diversamente abili.
Un brevetto d'invenzione registrato. 100% Made in Italy.
  



HOW IS IT MADE ?
SoapUp®
is simple but brilliant!
SoapUp®
consists of three parts:


a stainless steel wire, ending with a slot that makes SoapUp® adjustable to various kind of tap;



a colored no-slip gripper, to decorate and to prevent SoapUp® slipping away;



a stainless steel pin, designed specifically for SoapUp® that makes SoapUp® easily rechargeable.

DI COSA SI COMPONE ?
SoapUp® è un'idea semplice, ma geniale!
Si compone di pochi elementi:
un cavetto in acciaio inox che rende SoapUp® adattabile al vostro rubinetto semplicemente allargando o stringendo l'asola con cui termina;
un tubicino colorato di rivestimento, che oltre a darvi la possibilità di scegliere il colore più adatto al vostro ambiente, assicura SoapUp® al rubinetto, impedendogli di scivolare;
un perno, sempre in acciaio inox, progettato appositamente per SoapUp® e che lo rende facilmente ricaricabile.


                               
 READY TO USE


SoapUp®
is provided with a first white musk soap bar, and It
is ready to use: just open the packaging, hang SoapUp®
to the tap and start washing your hands!
SoapUp® holds
the soap above the sink, so it is always available.
 SoapUp® keeps the soap dry giving to it a long life. Dirt and waste are eliminated!
PRONTO ALL'USO SoapUp®, fornito con una prima saponetta al muschio bianco, è subito pronto all'uso: vi basterà aprire la confezione in cartone riciclato ed applicarlo al vostro rubinetto. 
Lontano dall'acqua il vostro sapone avrà una lunga vita! Non si deteriora, non crea sporcizia ed è sempre a portata di mano.
 



ACCESSORIES

SoapUp®
can be used with specific tubular bracket in polished stainless
steel. 

The
bracket is equipped with 3M
double-sided adhesive. It is easy to apply and there is no need to make any
hole in the wall.
Three
differents brackets:


wall bracket;






counter top bracket;



shower bracket.





Available
with round or square base. You can adapt it to every environment: ideal for the bathroom, shower and kitchen.

ACCESSORI 
Se il rubinetto non è adatto, SoapUp® può essere utilizzato con le specifiche staffe in acciaio inox. Si apllicano sul piano o a parete senza forare, grazie al biadesivo 3M in dotazione.

Tre staffe differenti:



staffa da parete;



staffa top;



staffa doccia.



Realizzate ad hoc per la parete o per il piano di bagno e cucina o per l'uso in doccia. Disponibili nella versione a base quadrata o rotonda.
Appendere il vostro SoapUp® sarà semplicissimo!

SoapUp®
is available in 8 colors. Choose the one that best suits in your
environment!

<p>My project that needs supporting, is titled <em>'The Universal Embrace'</em>. It is a web based interactive design of two men embracing, quite politically fitting in these times of marriage equality debates. </p>
<p>What’s so intriguingly controversial yet banal about two men in love hugging? It has never been done before in a contemporary interactive medium! This is a technological current statement about love between men. Historically many embraces are hetero-central. My creativity over my life has been a narrative, and this is its more self actualised continuation!</p>
<p>The essence is of human touch as a necessity for the human experience, based on love. This project is born of that emotion. It aims to create an online interactive journal of narrative discovery. It takes apart the moment of the embrace, and explores it in an interactive way physically, emotionally, and spiritually, all the while politicising it through an antipodean context in a constructed location, for a worldwide web audience.</p>
<p><em>I want you to be a part of it!</em></p>
<p><strong>Why this crowdfunfing?</strong></p>
<p>This funding is needed to allow me a living wage whilst I study and create. Hopefully, when 2014 comes, it will be accepted as a PhD study , that’s the aim! I need support for rent, living expenses, software, helthcare and studio hire. I'm not afraid to work fo this or offer some worthwhile perks for being a part of this! (See right).</p>

Introduction to the Creative Project - 'The Universal Embrace': What is it?
My project that needs supporting, is titled 'The Universal Embrace'. It is a web based interactive design of two men embracing, quite politically fitting in these times of marriage equality debates. 
What’s so intriguingly controversial yet banal about two men in love hugging? It has never been done before in a contemporary interactive medium! This is a technological current statement about love between men. Historically many embraces are hetero-central. My creativity over my life has been a narrative, and this is its more self actualised continuation!
The essence is of human touch as a necessity for the human experience, based on love. This project is born of that emotion. It aims to create an online interactive journal of narrative discovery. It takes apart the moment of the embrace, and explores it in an interactive way physically, emotionally, and spiritually, all the while politicising it through an antipodean context in a constructed location, for a worldwide web audience.
I want you to be a part of it!
Why this crowdfunfing?
This funding is needed to allow me a living wage whilst I study and create. Hopefully, when 2014 comes, it will be accepted as a PhD study , that’s the aim! I need support for rent, living expenses, software, helthcare and studio hire. I'm not afraid to work fo this or offer some worthwhile perks for being a part of this! (See right).

Investigación del artista en torno al abuso infantil en la cuna de la Iglesia Católica y en la rama ultra conservadora del Opus Dei. Posteriormente desarrollada y performatizada por el propio Azcona durante los años 2015 y 2016 en veinticuatro ciudades de los seis países europeos Portugal, Italia, Inglaterra, Irlanda, Francia y España, donde en 1946 comenzó la labor del Opus Dei.<div>
<br/><div>
<div>
<div></div>
<h3>Un proyecto artístico multidisciplinar, fotografía documental y de denuncia, instalación artística y performance art del artista Abel Azcona.</h3>
<div><br/></div>En 2002, la Organización Mundial de la Salud estimó que 150 millones de niñas y 73 millones de niños menores de 18 años experimentaron relaciones sexuales forzadas u otras formas de violencia sexual con contacto físico. En el año 2012 diversos medios de comunicación españoles relataron con informes especializados, que uno de cada cinco menores ha sufrido o sufre abusos sexuales, aunque solo se conozcan y se denuncien el 2% de los casos. Según diferentes estudios más de el 30 % de los abusos están relacionados directamente con la Iglesia Católica.<br/><br/>El artista haciendo un recorrido por distintos parques de su ciudad natal Pamplona, acompañado por veintinueve adultos vinculados a historias de abusos a menores, insta en esta nueva pieza a la reflexión de lo que ya es conocido como la sombra de la pederastia. Metáfora que tanto la Iglesia Católica como diferentes gobiernos emplean al hablar de esta grave problemática internacional. Las treintas historias, incluida la del propio <b>Abel Azcona</b> construyen una pieza biográfica y crítica, empleando la fotografía, la instalación y el performance como herramienta catártica colectiva. <br/><br/><img align=""left"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://payload332.cargocollective.com/1/9/297781/8955202/IMG_1437_1250.JPG"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><i>El artista Abel Azcona durante uno de los encuentros en un parque en Pamplona.</i><br/><br/><b>The Shadow</b> es un proyecto expositivo compuesto por fotografía, instalación y performance art. En la muestra, además de las treinta fotografías, una asociada a cada experiencia personal, podemos encontrar una instalación de reproducción real de uno de los parques infantiles dentro del espacio galerístico. Donde el artista <b>Abel Azcona</b> permanece sentado en un columpio de forma permanente invitando al espectador a ocupar el otro asiento. Azcona les cuenta en primera persona cada uno de los relatos de los treinta protagonistas del proyecto, así como el suyo propio. Del mismo modo que ellos relataron la difícil experiencia al artista en su día, en frente del parque infantil real en su ciudad natal Pamplona. Treinta parques con sus correspondientes historias, que fueron fotografiados durante los meses de noviembre y diciembre en la fría y lluviosa Pamplona.<br/><br/><b>Abel Azcona</b> fue abandonado al nacer por su madre la cual ejercía la prostitución, ningún hombre reclamó su paternidad por lo que fue puesto a disposición de instituciones adoptivas. Su infancia estuvo marcada por la ausencia de estabilidad y por el cambio constante de centros y familias de acogida. Durante este periplo de falsas familias y sustituciones emocionales Azcona también tuvo que enfrentarse a varios episodios de abusos y maltratos, los cuales han marcado su obra de una forma definitiva. Herida que junto a los veintinueve participantes del proyecto, explora y muestra de forma directa y sin filtros en el proyecto artístico ""The Shadow"".<br/><br/>Con <b>The Shadow</b> se busca dar voz a aquellas víctimas hoy adultas, las cuales han sufrido abusos en su infancia. Azcona rodeado de fotografías de espacios vinculados al entorno infantil de cada una de las protagonistas relatará sus historias, recuerdos y sentimientos. Testimonios de personas que han confiado a Azcona sus experiencias, en todos los casos con un fuerte vínculo con la Iglesia y más concretamente con el Opus Dei. También conocido por sus discípulos como La Obra es una organización de gran importancia en la ultra conservadora Pamplona. Ciudad que homenajea en sus calles a su fundador Escrivá de Balaguer, hijo adoptivo de la misma todavía a día de hoy. Muchos de los casos no son denunciados en gran parte por miedo a ser estigmatizados, a las represalias o a no ser creídos. La falta de confianza en las autoridades, en muchos casos militantes de La Obra, también dificulta la visibilación de esta problemática. La falta de conciencia social también ha contribuido a que muchos casos no se denuncien. <br/><br/><img align=""left"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://payload332.cargocollective.com/1/9/297781/8955202/IMG_1441_1250.JPG"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><i>El artista Abel Azcona durante uno de los encuentros en un parque en Pamplona.</i><br/><br/>Durante los años 2015 y 2016 el proyecto es expuesto y performatizado en veinticuatro galerías, museos y espacios artísticos internacionales de ciudades, especialmente escogidas a nivel internacional, como Oporto, Trento, Salerno, Avignon, Bordeaux, Limerick, Bradford, Birmingham, Valladolid, Vitoria, Segovia o Soria. Una denuncia internacional contra situación ocultada por la propia Iglesia Católico y conservadurismo navarro, exponiendo el secreto y el miedo de centenares de personas que viven con la herida incurable del abuso. De nuevo, el artista nos habla de el arte de explorar fantasmas, de mirar atrás y ser capaces de conocer y asumir nuestra propia sombra. Un arte con sentido crítico y resiliente. ""The Shadow"" no debe ser únicamente un proyecto artístico, sino debe ser un detonante de resistencia, denuncia y visibilización. <div><p><br/><b>La sombra de Carlota</b><br/><br/>""Un día, él me dijo que lo que me hacía era como jugar, desde ese día no quise jugar nunca más. Cada vez que tenía un juguete en la mano tenía miedo que viniera y me tocara, tenía miedo a reír, miedo a ser feliz"". En el mes de Diciembre, Carlota viajó a Pamplona para participar en el proyecto. Junto a Abel Azcona visitó los emplazamientos de la infancia de ella, mientras narraba su historia personal al artista. Los dos terminaron sentados en los columpios del parque infantil donde durante años Carlota había vivido.<br/><br/>""Él era mi sombra. Tenía únicamente nueve años y él, hermano de mi padre, me besaba con un aliento terrible, mi espalda y mi cuerpo de niña. Me penetro varias veces, yo no sabía si el dolor era normal. O si eran unas cosquillas muy fuertes"". Carlota nació en Pamplona hace más de treinta años. Es hija de una familia de nueve hermanos. Siete hombres y dos mujeres. Cuando era una niña asistía a un colegio de niñas. El hermano de su padre, un religioso perteneciente al Opus Dei en Navarra, abuso de ella en más de veinte ocasiones. Al igual que de su otra hermana. Carlota cuando cumplió la mayoría de edad denunció, pero a la semana retiró la demanda por presión de su entorno. <br/><br/>""Recuerdo que cuando venía a casa nos decía a mis hermanos y a mi que rezáramos mucho y que Dios nos quería, gracias a él aprendí a odiar a Dios."" En la actualidad Carlota solo siente como familia a su hermana, con la que comparte la experiencia de abuso, el resto de la familia le ha dado la espalda. Hace años que no vive en Pamplona, por lo complicado de la situación tuvo que abandonar la ciudad. Llora cada vez que vuelve a pisar la que para ella es una ciudad gris y llena de secretos.<br/><br/><img align=""left"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://payload332.cargocollective.com/1/9/297781/8955202/IMG_1291_1250.JPG"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><b>La sombra de Carlota.</b><i>Parque vinculado a la infancia de Carlota en Pamplona.</i><br/><br/><b>La sombra de Tomás</b><br/><br/>""Aquel hombre malo siempre me esperaba detrás de la puerta de las habitaciones, veía por el pasillo su sombra y temblaba. Me decía que lo que me hacía era normal, que estaba bien, pero que si lo contaba no tendría amigos nunca más."" En el mes de Diciembre, Tomás acompañado por Abel Azcona, visitó los emplazamientos vinculados a su infancia. Tomás y Abel se contaron mutuamente sus experiencias personales y los dos terminaron su encuentro sentados en los columpios donde el propio Tomás había jugado en diversas ocasiones durante toda su infancia.<br/><br/>""Lo denuncié, no me creyeron, pero me cambiaron de internado. Ya no volví a verlo, pero siempre recordaré sus manos en mi cuerpo y su mirada de deseo. Yo miraba la puerta de mi habitación creyendo que aparecería en cualquier momento."" Procedente de una familia de seis hermanos, junto a su hermano mayor fue a un internado católico debido a su conducta, según su padres, no adecuada. Durante los tres años que formaba parte del alumnado del centro, fue abusado por un miembro del equipo docente. Finalmente lo denunció en su casa, pero únicamente fue cambiado de centro y curso el bachillerato en un colegio masculino de Pamplona vinculado al Opus Dei.<br/><br/>""Yo sabía que estaba mal, pero muchas veces lo olvidaba. Para mi, por mi educación católica era pecado, era una secreto inconfesable. Una vergüenza. Cuando mi familia lo supo, me cambiaron de centro y no se volvió a hablar nunca más. "" Tomás tiene 18 años. En este momento ha empezado un grado en la Universidad de Navarra vinculada al Opus Dei.

Aquello no era amor y mis miedos no me dejaban asumirlo. Pero siempre me ha perseguido y me persigue como una sombra. Ya no soy capaz de amar a otras personas sin sentirlo antinatural, sin sentirme sucio.""<br/><br/>Ernesto ya es adulto, pero hace tan sólo diez años cuando asistía un colegio masculino navarro vinculado al Opus Dei tuvo una experiencia de abuso por el sacerdote del centro.

</div></div>","""The Shadow"" te necesita para hacerse realidad.The Shadow o La Sombra es un proyecto artístico, diseñado y gestado por el artista Abel Azcona durante el invierno de 2014 en la ciudad de Pamplona, al norte de España. Investigación del artista en torno al abuso infantil en la cuna de la Iglesia Católica y en la rama ultra conservadora del Opus Dei. Posteriormente desarrollada y performatizada por el propio Azcona durante los años 2015 y 2016 en veinticuatro ciudades de los seis países europeos Portugal, Italia, Inglaterra, Irlanda, Francia y España, donde en 1946 comenzó la labor del Opus Dei.



Un proyecto artístico multidisciplinar, fotografía documental y de denuncia, instalación artística y performance art del artista Abel Azcona.
En 2002, la Organización Mundial de la Salud estimó que 150 millones de niñas y 73 millones de niños menores de 18 años experimentaron relaciones sexuales forzadas u otras formas de violencia sexual con contacto físico. En el año 2012 diversos medios de comunicación españoles relataron con informes especializados, que uno de cada cinco menores ha sufrido o sufre abusos sexuales, aunque solo se conozcan y se denuncien el 2% de los casos. Según diferentes estudios más de el 30 % de los abusos están relacionados directamente con la Iglesia Católica.El artista haciendo un recorrido por distintos parques de su ciudad natal Pamplona, acompañado por veintinueve adultos vinculados a historias de abusos a menores, insta en esta nueva pieza a la reflexión de lo que ya es conocido como la sombra de la pederastia. Metáfora que tanto la Iglesia Católica como diferentes gobiernos emplean al hablar de esta grave problemática internacional. Las treintas historias, incluida la del propio Abel Azcona construyen una pieza biográfica y crítica, empleando la fotografía, la instalación y el performance como herramienta catártica colectiva. El artista Abel Azcona durante uno de los encuentros en un parque en Pamplona.The Shadow es un proyecto expositivo compuesto por fotografía, instalación y performance art. En la muestra, además de las treinta fotografías, una asociada a cada experiencia personal, podemos encontrar una instalación de reproducción real de uno de los parques infantiles dentro del espacio galerístico. Donde el artista Abel Azcona permanece sentado en un columpio de forma permanente invitando al espectador a ocupar el otro asiento. Azcona les cuenta en primera persona cada uno de los relatos de los treinta protagonistas del proyecto, así como el suyo propio. Del mismo modo que ellos relataron la difícil experiencia al artista en su día, en frente del parque infantil real en su ciudad natal Pamplona. Treinta parques con sus correspondientes historias, que fueron fotografiados durante los meses de noviembre y diciembre en la fría y lluviosa Pamplona.Abel Azcona fue abandonado al nacer por su madre la cual ejercía la prostitución, ningún hombre reclamó su paternidad por lo que fue puesto a disposición de instituciones adoptivas. Su infancia estuvo marcada por la ausencia de estabilidad y por el cambio constante de centros y familias de acogida. Durante este periplo de falsas familias y sustituciones emocionales Azcona también tuvo que enfrentarse a varios episodios de abusos y maltratos, los cuales han marcado su obra de una forma definitiva. Herida que junto a los veintinueve participantes del proyecto, explora y muestra de forma directa y sin filtros en el proyecto artístico ""The Shadow"".Con The Shadow se busca dar voz a aquellas víctimas hoy adultas, las cuales han sufrido abusos en su infancia. Azcona rodeado de fotografías de espacios vinculados al entorno infantil de cada una de las protagonistas relatará sus historias, recuerdos y sentimientos. Testimonios de personas que han confiado a Azcona sus experiencias, en todos los casos con un fuerte vínculo con la Iglesia y más concretamente con el Opus Dei. También conocido por sus discípulos como La Obra es una organización de gran importancia en la ultra conservadora Pamplona. Ciudad que homenajea en sus calles a su fundador Escrivá de Balaguer, hijo adoptivo de la misma todavía a día de hoy. Muchos de los casos no son denunciados en gran parte por miedo a ser estigmatizados, a las represalias o a no ser creídos. La falta de confianza en las autoridades, en muchos casos militantes de La Obra, también dificulta la visibilación de esta problemática. La falta de conciencia social también ha contribuido a que muchos casos no se denuncien. El artista Abel Azcona durante uno de los encuentros en un parque en Pamplona.Durante los años 2015 y 2016 el proyecto es expuesto y performatizado en veinticuatro galerías, museos y espacios artísticos internacionales de ciudades, especialmente escogidas a nivel internacional, como Oporto, Trento, Salerno, Avignon, Bordeaux, Limerick, Bradford, Birmingham, Valladolid, Vitoria, Segovia o Soria. Una denuncia internacional contra situación ocultada por la propia Iglesia Católico y conservadurismo navarro, exponiendo el secreto y el miedo de centenares de personas que viven con la herida incurable del abuso. De nuevo, el artista nos habla de el arte de explorar fantasmas, de mirar atrás y ser capaces de conocer y asumir nuestra propia sombra. Un arte con sentido crítico y resiliente. ""The Shadow"" no debe ser únicamente un proyecto artístico, sino debe ser un detonante de resistencia, denuncia y visibilización. La sombra de Carlota""Un día, él me dijo que lo que me hacía era como jugar, desde ese día no quise jugar nunca más. Cada vez que tenía un juguete en la mano tenía miedo que viniera y me tocara, tenía miedo a reír, miedo a ser feliz"". En el mes de Diciembre, Carlota viajó a Pamplona para participar en el proyecto. Junto a Abel Azcona visitó los emplazamientos de la infancia de ella, mientras narraba su historia personal al artista. Los dos terminaron sentados en los columpios del parque infantil donde durante años Carlota había vivido.""Él era mi sombra. Tenía únicamente nueve años y él, hermano de mi padre, me besaba con un aliento terrible, mi espalda y mi cuerpo de niña. Me penetro varias veces, yo no sabía si el dolor era normal. O si eran unas cosquillas muy fuertes"". Carlota nació en Pamplona hace más de treinta años. Es hija de una familia de nueve hermanos. Siete hombres y dos mujeres. Cuando era una niña asistía a un colegio de niñas. El hermano de su padre, un religioso perteneciente al Opus Dei en Navarra, abuso de ella en más de veinte ocasiones. Al igual que de su otra hermana. Carlota cuando cumplió la mayoría de edad denunció, pero a la semana retiró la demanda por presión de su entorno. ""Recuerdo que cuando venía a casa nos decía a mis hermanos y a mi que rezáramos mucho y que Dios nos quería, gracias a él aprendí a odiar a Dios."" En la actualidad Carlota solo siente como familia a su hermana, con la que comparte la experiencia de abuso, el resto de la familia le ha dado la espalda. Hace años que no vive en Pamplona, por lo complicado de la situación tuvo que abandonar la ciudad. Llora cada vez que vuelve a pisar la que para ella es una ciudad gris y llena de secretos.La sombra de Carlota.Parque vinculado a la infancia de Carlota en Pamplona.La sombra de Tomás""Aquel hombre malo siempre me esperaba detrás de la puerta de las habitaciones, veía por el pasillo su sombra y temblaba. Me decía que lo que me hacía era normal, que estaba bien, pero que si lo contaba no tendría amigos nunca más."" En el mes de Diciembre, Tomás acompañado por Abel Azcona, visitó los emplazamientos vinculados a su infancia. Tomás y Abel se contaron mutuamente sus experiencias personales y los dos terminaron su encuentro sentados en los columpios donde el propio Tomás había jugado en diversas ocasiones durante toda su infancia.""Lo denuncié, no me creyeron, pero me cambiaron de internado. Ya no volví a verlo, pero siempre recordaré sus manos en mi cuerpo y su mirada de deseo. Yo miraba la puerta de mi habitación creyendo que aparecería en cualquier momento."" Procedente de una familia de seis hermanos, junto a su hermano mayor fue a un internado católico debido a su conducta, según su padres, no adecuada. Durante los tres años que formaba parte del alumnado del centro, fue abusado por un miembro del equipo docente. Finalmente lo denunció en su casa, pero únicamente fue cambiado de centro y curso el bachillerato en un colegio masculino de Pamplona vinculado al Opus Dei.""Yo sabía que estaba mal, pero muchas veces lo olvidaba. Para mi, por mi educación católica era pecado, era una secreto inconfesable. Una vergüenza. Cuando mi familia lo supo, me cambiaron de centro y no se volvió a hablar nunca más. "" Tomás tiene 18 años. En este momento ha empezado un grado en la Universidad de Navarra vinculada al Opus Dei. Él afirma que intenta vivir como si no hubiera pasado, pero le sigue afectando en su vida diaria. Una herida que siempre estará en su piel.La sombra de Tomás.Parque vinculado a la infancia de Tomás en Pamplona.La sombra de Ernesto""Sólo fue una vez, cinco minutos tan rápido que a veces pensaba que lo había soñado. Nunca lo conté, sólo lo escribí. Leia mi cuaderno para no olvidarlo, porque olvidarlo hubiera sido mentirme a mi mismo. En el colegio no podía contarlo, él era el ejemplo a seguir. Nadie me creería, además él me dijo que lo que me hacía estaba bien. Era amor, y Dios quería que los hombres se dieran amor. Ahora lo recuerdo y siento repulsión. Aquello no era amor y mis miedos no me dejaban asumirlo. Pero siempre me ha perseguido y me persigue como una sombra.

Communication has resulted in some good things. The 8 pm curfew on buskers isn't being enforced, and new places for buskers to work have appeared in the French market and other areas. Street performing has evolved into street theater, but artists must have a place to live and practice that's close to the French Quarter. A Plethora of well meaning new residents drawn by the areas popularity and the fact that it didn't flood during the storms are arriving in large numbers. They, like my new neighbor across the street, has complained about the people on either side of him and to bunkhouse about hearing people talk. Bands and dance troupes, such as The Gris Gris Strut, practice here, and we always stop before 9pm. Still, he complains, wearing a Bywater T shirt as If It were a police uniform..

The Kamp Katrina project film and book was a collaboration between Buskers Bunkhouse residents, a California filmmaker, a college writing teacher, a high school writing teacher, and an associate dean.
The project began during a professional conference in New Orleans where the film Kamp Katrina was screened. Ms Pearl invited the audience to her home to see the real story behind the film, as she believed that the film didn't “tell the real story.” Currently, the project includes this book as well as a forthcoming film Kamp Katrina: A Love Letter to New Orleans, and a website that continues the Kamp Katrina story online.

Kamp Katrina/Buskers Bunkhouse has experienced the highs of being part of the historical remaking of the unique New Orleans culture. As well as the lows of a neighborhood struggling with the new gentrification and trying not to become another sterile bedroom community.
The Bunkhouse has housed many local and international artists preserving old forms of music and performing arts while birthing new ones . Ms. Pearl who keeps a large garden for the residents, says, “I can't create a rosebush, or an artist, but I can put them both in good fertile soil and watch them grow.” She considers herself a folk historian and a patron of the local arts. Through her inspiration, Kamp Katrina and its residents have been the subject of blogs, books, films, and magazine articles. Ms. Pearl was honored as a local hero in Gambit' Magazine and named the Grand Marshall of the 2009 and 2013 New Orleans Fringe Festival.
However, Ms. Pearl and the rest of the residents have endured dark times as well. Many of the residents suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result of Hurricane Katrina and the trauma of recovery however they have continued to serve the community lobbing for protection and permits and recondition.
Thankfully the police are on our side, and Kristen Palmer, our representative sent her staff to meet with Buskers Bunkhouse At Flora's, A local hang out frequented by many locals and Europeans as well. Communication has resulted in some good things. The 8 pm curfew on buskers isn't being enforced, and new places for buskers to work have appeared in the French market and other areas. Street performing has evolved into street theater, but artists must have a place to live and practice that's close to the French Quarter. A Plethora of well meaning new residents drawn by the areas popularity and the fact that it didn't flood during the storms are arriving in large numbers. They, like my new neighbor across the street, has complained about the people on either side of him and to bunkhouse about hearing people talk. Bands and dance troupes, such as The Gris Gris Strut, practice here, and we always stop before 9pm. Still, he complains, wearing a Bywater T shirt as If It were a police uniform.. The majority of the neighborhood has no problem with music and people talking, even after 9 pm.
We need a neighborhood that reflects the majorities desires. Recently there has been a war on our culture. Old laws have appeared that haven't been enforced for years. Live music venues such as the St Roch Tavern and others have been fined and restricted to a point articles have been written pointing at the abuse of power we all witnessed during the St Roch trial, Mimi's is now at risk along with other live music and parade venues.
We can and we will rise up. This takes funding. Buskers Bunkhouse has always existed on tips alone. Its no longer a efficient way to maintain Buskers Bunkhouse.  Your donations will go to help with construction repairs so that we can continue to help house busker's from all over the world who come to our beautiful city to make their way in the world.  We have been ordered to make some repairs and due to our growing popularity our needs have outgrown our tips.
Recently we hosted Kiriaka, A Swedish drum troupe of over 30 that travels the world. While Kiriaka was hosted by Buskers Bunkhouse they participated in at least 5 non profit venues in the New Orleans area. We now have a new band practice space and can host full bands of 20 people.
We are in the process of securing a non profit status, so that helping us helps you as well. Your contributions will be tax deductible.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong><br/></strong>Many of those who suffer with and have lost from Breast Cancer, or have family members who have, are Desolate. The struggles they face and the lack of awareness makes a person feel singled out, and as if others just don't truly understand the struggles you're going through. Desolate stands for beauty, for hope, and with the eagle and flag, it stands for unity. Unity of those around you who are willing to promote awareness, and take away the Desolate feeling those who suffer feel. Help give someone hope, and faith, and take away a small part, if not all, the feeling of Desolation. </p>

Many of those who suffer with and have lost from Breast Cancer, or have family members who have, are Desolate. The struggles they face and the lack of awareness makes a person feel singled out, and as if others just don't truly understand the struggles you're going through. Desolate stands for beauty, for hope, and with the eagle and flag, it stands for unity. Unity of those around you who are willing to promote awareness, and take away the Desolate feeling those who suffer feel. Help give someone hope, and faith, and take away a small part, if not all, the feeling of Desolation.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Arteles Creative Center provides the best environment for the production phase of Augmented Organism. Located  in the countryside of Hämeenkyrö, in the area of Haukijärvi, the artists will be in direct contact with nature with easy access to lakes and forests for their field research, yet have access to nearby towns for any supplies they will need along the way. They will also work with the Arteles logistical &amp; production staff as well as have access to the local social, creative, technical and administrative networks for support. Arteles makes the perfect experimental station for research in reevaluating the balance &amp; integration of the technological/physical realms, and the balance between mind/body/spirit. We will creatively study and practice new ways of bridging physical and digital environmental conditions.</p>
<h2>Why practice based research?</h2>
<p>Highly focused creative exploration and production pipelines often yield breakthroughs for research and development in communities of all kinds. During the <i>AugOrg</i> Residency, a deep dive will be taken into creative practice based research that is highly geared towards production techniques that explore relationships between the following:</p>

Meet the Artists


Interdisciplinary artists Cy Gorman (AUS) and Jazmyne Koch (GER/USA) met at the 2014 World Dance Alliance Global Summit in Angers, France, where they were both showcasing choreographic works that presented unique perspectives on contemporizing the past and envisioning the future. They immediately recognized a shared passion for creatively expressing theimportance of the individual'sinterconnected relationship with Mother Nature and the art of storytelling with film.
In 2015, Cy and Jaz began a transnational new media/film research project exploring states of liminality and presence by combining mythological ""goddess"" archetypes within various physical & digital environments.
In the latter half of 2015, Cy met cyborg artist and activist Neil Harbisson (SPN/USA). The two formed another transnational creative collaboration and Cy began integrating Neil's sonochromatic files into both his audio and visual designs. This additional contribution from Neil, combined with the developing languages of Cy and Jaz's work, sparked the interest of one of the most renowned creative residency centres in Scandinavia and broader Europe - The Arteles Creative Residency Center. 
The Arteles Creative Residency Center have invited Cy and Jaz in collaboration and consultation with Neil Harbisson to develop their individual and collective AugOrg work and practice in Finland during the month of June, 2016.

A big turquoise and white Nevada Division of Forestry bus was parked in a pasture near Alturas California. And he was for sale.<br/><br/>Wow we all thought. A bus like that would change our annual Burning Man expeditions. No more expensive big trucks to rent to haul gear for our camp of nine or ten burners, which included our Burning Man art car, the Wonder Wagon stagecoach and the team of 12 wonder ponies. A big bus like this would definitely bring joy to our Burning man community. We decided to think about it.<br/><br/>The bus filled our Wonder Camp musings all week. If it was still parked in the pasture on our way back to Washington, we would snag the phone number and call when we got home. Being able to buy and caretake a big bus just seemed so unlikely but what the heck we all crossed our fingers and set our intentions. <br/><br/>Our collective energy worked and one week after the 2010 Burn, the 26’ decommissioned fire crew bus sat in our Tacoma driveway. What a find. We immediately named him Art the Wonder Bus. Art was already partially converted to a camper bus and was a Burning man veteran, having gone to a couple Burns with his previous owner Sam. Sam had picked him up at a vehicle auction when Nevada upgraded their fleet of fire crew buses. This bus had been stationed in Tonopah, Nevada and was crewed by minimum security prisoners. Art had history.<br/><br/>Our Tacoma area Burner friends pitched in with us to make modest improvements so Art would be ready for the 2011 Burn. A bigger kitchen counter, overhead cabinet doors, a sound system, curtains, roof top rack for bikes. Nothing too fancy. Just a Burner bus.<br/><br/>Art the Wonder Bus was a hit at Burning Man 2011. He became the hub for our Wonder Camp like no rental truck ever could. As it turns out Art is a hub for several communities, not just Burning Man. Over time Art has made himself useful to local post-Burning Man events, outdoor groups and the music arts community, and the political community. Events and organizations such as Burning Man, Seacompression, Ignition Northwest, Occupy Tacoma, Titanium Sporkestra, Honk Fest West, and the Tacoma Mountaineers. When Art joined our family, we had no idea how useful and beloved he would become. His potenial contributions were unknown but clearly we have gone from the owners to the caretakers. That’s why when we learned Art the Wonder Bus had been stolen from his rural home on Key Peninsula, many people cried “Noooooo.” OK, we might have yelled some other words too.<br/><br/>The bus apparently turned the heads of some thieves too. They did not see his magic and his gifts to the community. The tweakers just saw a hunk of metal to plunder for a few dollars at a scrap yard. So they stole Art. They jammed a screwdriver into Art’s central nervous system and twisted. Art groaned and turned over. The tweakers drove him through the unbolted gate and away in the darkness. Five days later, he was found only 3 miles from his home, as the crow flies. But he was buried so deep in dense woods that he might as well have been in India. We would have never seen him just scouting around. If the thieves had more time, they were going to flip him over and continue to butcher him as they had done to the other stolen and stripped vehicles around him.<br/><br/>With the help of an amazing tow truck operator we pulled Art from a potential final resting place back to our place and have begun the restoration work. <br/><br/>That’s where all who view this slide show come in to play. Art needs financial aid to continue his life journey serving diverse communities. What the thieves stripped will cost about $4,000 to replace. We will do all the work but need help to buy the following items that were stolen: radiator, battery and cables, windshield, electrical control panel, stereo and speakers, mirrors, sun visor, defrost fans, wiring harnesses, wheel chocks, fire extinguisher, first aid kit, gray water barrels, awning conduit, miscellaneous tools, bottle jack, tow hitch, tow chain, triangle reflectors, rebar stakes, and the rescue towing charge.<br/><br/>Thank you for letting us share the story of Art the Wonder Bus. If his story and his potential compels you to donate money to Art’s restoration work, we would be humbled and grateful. And many communities would benefit from your generousity.

sessions, health screenings, arts and crafts,
inter-generational activities, transportation assistance and many others to over 150 Acoma elders. We are the only program in the entire Pueblo that

United States dating back to 1100 AD. There are over 4,000 enrolled tribal
members. More than 2,800 members live on tribal lands that cover 702 square
miles. The region where Acoma is located once experienced an economic boom with
the onset of uranium mining in the 1950â€™s but toward the end of the 1980â€™s the
industry busted leaving the area economically depressed and spiritually
wounded--the mine was located on the Acomaâ€™s sacred mountain, Mount
Taylor.  Today, unemployment in the Acoma Community is at 51%, with 27% of
the population living below poverty levels. </span>

told me â€œWhen an elder dies, itâ€™s as if a library has been burnedâ€, and that is
particularly true for the Pueblo for Acoma. Keres, the Acoma language, is in
danger of being lost forever because grandmothers and grandfathers who are
fluent in Keres are not living long enough to teach their â€œBabasâ€, or
grandchildren, their traditional language and traditions. The Acoma population
is aging rapidly. The life expectancy for Native Americans is lower than that
of all other races in the US: 65 years old, and 73 for non-Native
Americans.  Keres is not a written language, and storytelling is an oral
tradition, so what happens when that language barrier cannot be crossed? Entire
histories--stories of love, hardship, and creativity--fade into the past, and a generation grows up completely ignorant of their cultural identity. By
recording stories and songs told in Keres, personal histories and messages for
future generations, we can make sure this doesnâ€™t happen in Acoma. </span></p><p></p><p></p>

</div></div>","Our Story

The Pueblo of Acoma Senior Center
is a not-for-profit that provides vital services to community members 50-years-old or older. These services include health education
sessions, health screenings, arts and crafts,
inter-generational activities, transportation assistance and many others to over 150 Acoma elders. We are the only program in the entire Pueblo that
transports community members to crucial doctor's appointments and on basic errands to the grocery store or bank. 
Situated in Central New Mexico halfway between Albuquerque and Gallup, Acoma is the oldest continually inhabited Native American pueblo in the
United States dating back to 1100 AD. There are over 4,000 enrolled tribal
members. More than 2,800 members live on tribal lands that cover 702 square
miles. The region where Acoma is located once experienced an economic boom with
the onset of uranium mining in the 1950â€™s but toward the end of the 1980â€™s the
industry busted leaving the area economically depressed and spiritually
wounded--the mine was located on the Acomaâ€™s sacred mountain, Mount
Taylor.  Today, unemployment in the Acoma Community is at 51%, with 27% of
the population living below poverty levels. 
 
 
The Impact
 
A West African storyteller once
told me â€œWhen an elder dies, itâ€™s as if a library has been burnedâ€, and that is
particularly true for the Pueblo for Acoma. Keres, the Acoma language, is in
danger of being lost forever because grandmothers and grandfathers who are
fluent in Keres are not living long enough to teach their â€œBabasâ€, or
grandchildren, their traditional language and traditions. The Acoma population
is aging rapidly. The life expectancy for Native Americans is lower than that
of all other races in the US: 65 years old, and 73 for non-Native
Americans.  Keres is not a written language, and storytelling is an oral
tradition, so what happens when that language barrier cannot be crossed? Entire
histories--stories of love, hardship, and creativity--fade into the past, and a generation grows up completely ignorant of their cultural identity. By
recording stories and songs told in Keres, personal histories and messages for
future generations, we can make sure this doesnâ€™t happen in Acoma. 
 
 
What We Need 
With $1,000 our
program can buy recording equipment and pay for a part time media coordinator
to look after the studio and teach computer literacy classes and
workshops on audio editing software to the entire community for one year. Currently, we have a
spare room that we will be a perfect studio space. The Acoma Language
Retention Program has generously donated a Mac desktop computer, and we'll
use Audacity, a free audio editing software,  to edit our work (thank god we
don't have to buy Adobe Audition...for now), but you can help us purchase
equipment that is crucial to any quality recording studio space:

â€¨External Hard Drive - $130.00â€¨
Wav Recorder - $200.00â€¨
Condenser Mic - $100.00
â€¨Speakers - $45.00
â€¨Headphones - $25.00
Part Time Media Coordinator for
one year- $500
Total: $1000.000

We expect the Storytelling
Studio to be fully functional by this Summer, 2012. 

Check out our
projected timeline:

â€¨Januaryâ€¨- Recruit media coordinator and volunteersâ€¨-Fundraise for studio
equipment â€¨-Go door to door advertising studioâ€¨-Make sample recordings of
elders to share with Acoma's tribal government

February â€¨- Schedule Future Voices of New Mexico documentary presentationâ€¨-
Plan for Santa Ana Pueblo and Acoma Language Retention Programâ€™s audio
storybook Presentation to elders and communityâ€¨-Install Egg Cartons as soundproofing and clear
out spare room for studio spaceâ€¨ 

Marchâ€¨-Go to Acoma Laguna High School and Sky City School to advertise the projectâ€¨-Create audio storybooks in Keres
(the Acoma language) for the Acoma Language Retention Center

April - May
-Create â€œinterview kitsâ€ with helpful
questions and guidelines for interviewers 
-Advertise studio opening-Continue to teach elders how to use
equipment

June
Have a fully functional,
accessible studio space where community members can come and record their
personal histories, identities, and messages to one-another and for future
generations. All recordings will be archived in the Puebloâ€™s library and
will not be made available to the public.
 
Folks, if we reach our entire

<h3>The video is from my first exhibit you get an example of what my work is.</h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello Indie gogo Fam</p>
<p>My name is Suritah Wignall and I am a visual artist from Toronto Ontario. I have been practicing art for more that 15 years and have been trying to do it professionally for the last 5 years. My works show the beauty of my culture as an Afro-Caribbean Canadian Woman and the the beauty of woman. i love painting, shapes, skin tones, hair, textures and features as i am truly fascinated by woman. And My medium of choice is Acrylic, Oil, Cloths, mixed media and Japanese Paper</p>
<p><strong>My Campaign</strong></p>
<p>My campaign is that I have been invoted to have my first solo exhibition at a venue called La Comidilla in Seville, Spain. well, i am going to be truly honest,  i have never wanted to so badly but to live my life and do what it is i love to do. i believe that everyone should live out their passion. That is a birth right. but some of are more privileged than most, especially folks like us who have access to internet and contribute in this amazing way. Art and Creating is my Love, it has got me through some of the toughest times in my life, times where i did not even think i was going to make through certain situations. but to live as an artist is a gift.</p>
<p><strong>The Magnitude</strong></p>
<p>All i keep thinking about and this brings me to tears is that my grandpa is an 80 year old man who has had an open heart surgery and still has to work, because he cant pay his bills, my grandpa currently lives in miami and how my mom had to give up her dreams of being a couture designer to raise 3 girls as a single parent. I believe in working hard and anything that it is you love to do and because of them, i bust my ass off, because if they could sacrifice so much for me, what i can do is work hard to accomlish things that they werent able to. Especially as they grew up in Jamaica and i had the good fortune of growing up here in Toronto. I absolutely adore my grandpa, even when i would get write ups in community paper and mail it to him, he would tell the whole neighbourhood i was famous. LOL. and would always say, ""as long as your happy baby""</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>the funding i currently need is $1500 and its going to the airfare to Spain, because i am asking in such a short period of time, i feel that i would ask for the most important cost, which is my flight to Spain. Flights are not cheap, forunately i know people in Spain, that i can stay with, but at moment i cant aford the flight there. I have also applied to grants to help fund this project. but as we know grants are not always certain. this is my first time going the community route, which is eciting for me</p>
<p>If you help to fund this project, one of the perks is a print of your choice in the print section of my website. <a href=""http://www.sweetlikemango.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sweetlikemango.com</a> and if i dont recive full funding, the funds raised will still go to airflight costs</p>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>Being invited to exhibit my work in neighbourhood, where the focus is Flamenco is such an honour, it would be the first time the owner would exhibit works from an artist of Afro Caribbean descent, this is a mile stone for the neighbourhood and for myself to share my expereinces through my art as a woman of color.</p>
<p>I have had the opportunity to collaborate with Eryakh Badu, won an entepreneiural award from The University of Toronto in 2011, received numerous grants for my community work especially working with women who are survivors of vilence facilitating free art workshops and now having the opportunity to exhibit in Spain as my first international exhibition is such a huge stepping stone in my career as i feel it will open up many doors for me in sharing my creativity with the world</p>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>the other ways you can hel is maybe you would like to donate airmiles that you are not using as i feel that would be considerably helpful as well, so if you or anyone you know has extra airmiles they would like to donate for my first solo exhibit that would be such an honor as well maybe you would like some art. you can order my art at <a href=""http://www.sweetlikemango.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sweetlikemango.com</a>. please use the indie gogo share tools. I thank you so much for reading and your support on my creative journey. I will be creating a new video of my up to date art as the video is from my first solo exhibit</p>

<p><strong>""From Cover to Cover: 20 Years of African Voices""</strong> celebrates the wealth and diverse artistic styles of contemporary African-American artists that have been published on the magazine's front and back covers for the past two decades.

<h2><strong>About the exhibition</strong></h2>
<p>Danny Simmons, the founder of Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation, is the curator for the exhibition. Artwork from the magazine’s front and back covers will anchor the exhibition. Photo essays and other archival pieces will give viewers a historical perspective on African Voices’ 20-year celebration of Black art and literature. Photographer Marilyn Nance’s photographs documenting the African burial ground and Chester Higgins, Jr.’s stunning photograph of the late dance choreographer Katherine Dunham give viewers a chance to glimpse inside the magazine’s covers.  Michele Stewart’s haunting black and white sketch showing four pairs of girl legs sitting in a church pew holding hymn books captures the horror of poet Letta Simone-Nefertari Neely’s “Which patent leather shoe belong to which found leg.” The poem is dedicated to the four girls murdered in the 1963 church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama. The illustration masterfully shows the young girls living — one with a band aide on her knee — but their heads are not in the drawing, a visual sign that something unspeakable is amiss.</p>
<p>The exhibition will feature a rich selection of the journal’s cover artists including such distinguished artists as Faith Ringgold, Otto Neals, Justin Bua, Francks Deceus, JamesTop, Elizabeth Catlett and Verna Hart.</p>

<div>
<p>If you are into helping out please get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.</p>
</div>
<p>Hi, I am Demian Petryshyn, originally from <a href=""https://picasaweb.google.com/116317023794409731345/Easter2011?authkey=Gv1sRgCI3YwNvIlr-LEg#slideshow/5728080346543990994"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Edmonton</a> Alberta, the prairies of Western Canada. I have worked as a visual artist in Vancouver, Canada for the last ten years or so, with short stints in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thames_london_ontario_north_branch_1.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">London Ontario</a> to do my <a href=""https://picasaweb.google.com/116317023794409731345/Portfolio#slideshow/5735150888794395874"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MFA</a>, and <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/33278177@N00/6053723069/lightbox/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Albi</a> France to study <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_and_Punish"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Foucault</a> first hand. I've been working with <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/gruntgallery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">grunt gallery</a>, a Vancouver based <a href=""http://arcpost.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">artist-run centre</a>, for the past three years. With the help of various partners and friends like grunt, I'm getting into devloping my studio practice, and using social media to help fund the work. </p>
<p>The plan is to craft a self-sustaining aquatic ecosystem in a 10-gallon aquarium tank, a kind of plant mass in water with bugs and animals and stuff, maybe even a mushroom or two; but always a work of art, a sculpture. I look at the work of <a href=""http://youtu.be/0BPTNdmdJSc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hayao Miyazaki</a> and <a href=""http://youtu.be/Hk1_NhdDJvg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Snip Snip"">Amano Takashi</a>, for example, and I see compelling ways of thinking about the world. This aquarium is styled in their tribute. Your contributions will support the refinement of my skill in this medium, helping me to learn and develop technique over the duration of the campaign. The dream is something between a garden and a forest, with biological solutions for the problems posed in establishing a healthy aquaculture.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need to Move the Project Forward &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It’s a 10 Gallon Tank with a selection of freshwater flora and fauna. There is a shrimp, and two small snails named Jacob, Ehrich, and Mr. Wolf respectively. There are three fish too, but they are likely too busy to be bothered (although they enjoy the food pellets). Contributions can be made in the following categories to help with the tank's evolution: </p>

If you are into helping out please get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.

Hi, I am Demian Petryshyn, originally from Edmonton Alberta, the prairies of Western Canada. I have worked as a visual artist in Vancouver, Canada for the last ten years or so, with short stints in London Ontario to do my MFA, and Albi France to study Foucault first hand. I've been working with grunt gallery, a Vancouver based artist-run centre, for the past three years. With the help of various partners and friends like grunt, I'm getting into devloping my studio practice, and using social media to help fund the work. 
The plan is to craft a self-sustaining aquatic ecosystem in a 10-gallon aquarium tank, a kind of plant mass in water with bugs and animals and stuff, maybe even a mushroom or two; but always a work of art, a sculpture. I look at the work of Hayao Miyazaki and Amano Takashi, for example, and I see compelling ways of thinking about the world. This aquarium is styled in their tribute. Your contributions will support the refinement of my skill in this medium, helping me to learn and develop technique over the duration of the campaign. The dream is something between a garden and a forest, with biological solutions for the problems posed in establishing a healthy aquaculture.
 
What We Need to Move the Project Forward & What You Get
It’s a 10 Gallon Tank with a selection of freshwater flora and fauna. There is a shrimp, and two small snails named Jacob, Ehrich, and Mr. Wolf respectively. There are three fish too, but they are likely too busy to be bothered (although they enjoy the food pellets). Contributions can be made in the following categories to help with the tank's evolution: 

Temperature
Oxygen Levels
General Hardness ppm (mg/L) Fresh: GH
Carbonate Hardness ppm (mg/L) Fresh: KH
pH Fresh: pH
Nitrite ppm (mg/L) Fresh: NO2-
Nitrate ppm (mg/L) Fresh: NO3-
CO2 Levels

R&D - Web Streaming, Minecraft. . .  

Come back to this site to check out the progress as new perks and content become available during the course of the project. The smallest contributions have a big impact in keeping the project active. 
Special perks also include a selection of drawings, mini projects, and ultimately ownership of the finished still-water aquarium.



While I would love to make this the coolest thing ever, it's not a life and death thing. If the campaign goal is not reached I just won't be able to put as much of my time into the tank as I would want. That's it; it will still meet my goals, be dear to my heart, and be interesting as a work of art. Patience is at the heart of this game.

<p>DO NOT OPEN YOU PACKAGE if they arrive damaged. Bring the package to the Post Office and open it in front of an agent.

<h3>STATUS UPDATES!</h3>
<p><strong>8/6 - URGENT!</strong>  There are only five days left in the campaign and we need your help!  </p>
<p>With the existing donations, we have been able to make some necessary infrastructure adjustments and upgrade Atlas, but <strong>we need to reach $2,500 by 3 PM Sunday 8/7 </strong>to complete the third tree and canopy structure. </p>
<p>This is a photo of the third tree in progress!  Partially assembled tricycle for scale.</p>

<p>Once complete, hitting the following goals will let us finish the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>An additional $1,000 to purchase the full scale canopy LEDs, wire, and integrate them into the movement reactive system</li>
<li>$1,500 more to  get all of this hard work to the Playa, and get it placed front and center at 6:45 and Esplanade for everyone to enjoy</li>
<li>Everything above $5,000 will help us expand the sound and lights even further, for an enhanced experience!</li>
</ul>
<p>As artists, we seek to inspire and extol all that is beautifully human. To create not just aesthetically pleasing things or sounds, but to create spaces where art, technology, and human interactions come together into experiences that celebrate individuality, allow folks to find connection, build community, and foster understanding. It's a labor of love. And while done from a place of love, make no mistake - building these experiences is indeed labor...long hours, late nights...with little to no reward other than knowing we were able to make some people happy.  We hope experiencing this will add to your experience at the Burn this year!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support, and see you in the dust!!</p>

<p>The forest is comprised of three primary components:  three metallic tree structures, a sound/motion system, and a reactive led canopy.  These components are controlled by a hardware and software system dubbed ""Atlas"".</p>
<p>The goal is to build an interactive environmental multi-sensory art installation that incorporates many different elements together to create a life changing experience for its visitors.  The movement of these visitors within the forest affect the sound and visuals the installation produces, creating a space that is ever changing and alive.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467848004/ek62thdylblcyljzghp5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p><strong>The Trees</strong><br/>The three sculptures of metal trees form a diameter of 15-20 feet, with exposed root systems below and a canopy above that expands from the highest branches.  The base of each tree is shaped in octagonal rings.  Each trunk is 4 feet in diameter, staked to a height of 15 feet and reinforced vertically.  Donated / recycled steel makes up the base and infrastructure of each tree.</p>
<p><strong>The Sound and Motion Detection System</strong><br/>Four surround speakers are placed between the trees, creating the surround sound that fills the participants' space.  Each of the speakers reside inside designed mushroom sculptures for an optimal aural experience.  The sound system controllers and mixers are placed in the middle of the space between the trees inside a beautiful sculpture named ATLAS.</p>
<p>ATLAS is the main computer system which controls the sound system, cameras, sensors, and lights in the canopy.  A semi-transparent half-dome covers the ""head"" of ATLAS, while the body is built from steel and copper.</p>
<p><strong>The Canopy</strong><br/>The canopy has been designed to replicate ""Tree of Life"" geometry, and will be formed by intersecting and connected branches made of steel beams secured and reinforced with connectors and bolts that emerge from the three tree trunks.  A net of LED lights will be suspended from the tree's uppermost branches and will display sound reactive LED effects.</p>
<p>Imagine a cold night on the playa:  you've recently bought the $25 heart to heart hug perk and are about to be engulfed in a warm faux-fur embrace as the lights of the canopy sparkle around you.  A cavorting whirl of revelers dance around the trees, entering sound zones and triggering a symphony of sounds and illumination, delighting your senses.</p>

8/6 - URGENT!  There are only five days left in the campaign and we need your help!  
With the existing donations, we have been able to make some necessary infrastructure adjustments and upgrade Atlas, but we need to reach $2,500 by 3 PM Sunday 8/7 to complete the third tree and canopy structure. 
This is a photo of the third tree in progress!  Partially assembled tricycle for scale.

Here's an image of the canopy skeleton suspended by a crane at American Steel!

Once complete, hitting the following goals will let us finish the project:

An additional $1,000 to purchase the full scale canopy LEDs, wire, and integrate them into the movement reactive system
$1,500 more to  get all of this hard work to the Playa, and get it placed front and center at 6:45 and Esplanade for everyone to enjoy
Everything above $5,000 will help us expand the sound and lights even further, for an enhanced experience!

As artists, we seek to inspire and extol all that is beautifully human. To create not just aesthetically pleasing things or sounds, but to create spaces where art, technology, and human interactions come together into experiences that celebrate individuality, allow folks to find connection, build community, and foster understanding. It's a labor of love. And while done from a place of love, make no mistake - building these experiences is indeed labor...long hours, late nights...with little to no reward other than knowing we were able to make some people happy.  We hope experiencing this will add to your experience at the Burn this year!
Thank you so much for your support, and see you in the dust!!

</div><h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3><div>
<p>To make this production a success - and to make sure that my artists don't experience any financial hardship - it's important that our production have a few things:  <br/></p> <ul> <li>
<b>Funds to cover travel expenses.  </b>We'll be traveling on a shoestring budget, but we'll still need money to cover gas, food, and metro rides.<br/>
</li> <li>
<b>Basic props and set pieces.  </b>Though this is a workshop production, we want it to be as professional and beautiful as possible, so we will likely need to make a few properties purchases.  <br/>

<b>Publicity.  </b>Again, our advertising budget is totally shoestring and mostly consists of my printing out flyers on a LaserJet.  But ink, guys.  Ink is pricey.</li>
<li>
<b>An Audience!  </b>Emerging Artist Theatre asks us to guarantee one audience member for every minute of our show.  But much more importantly, we want to fill the house so that we can provide a great night of theatre to as many people as possible. <br/>
</li>
</ul>We would love it if you would make a monetary contribution, but getting the word out is even more important.  So whether or not you are able to make a donation, spreading the word about our production to your New York/New England/New Jersey/wherever friends helps us just as much as cash ever could.  <br/><br/> </div> <div> <h3>Why should I give?  <br/>

<p>In 2012, we had a <b>eureka moment</b> when we discovered that art was the best way to raise awareness of human rights stories and we launched our first ever Human Rights Film Festival in downtown Toronto. Each year, our Festival has grown by leaps and bounds, attracting more audience members, while collaborating with more partners and changemakers to provide a platform for people to share their human rights stories through the arts. In 2014 we had 19 Films, 13 Premieres, 21 Community Partners, 16 Countries in Focus, 1,380 Attendees, nearly triple the amount since we launched in 2012.</p>
<p><b>Everything was going according to plan for our 4th annual Film Festival when at the last minute one of our major backers had to unexpectedly pull out. We were completely blindsided, but we are determined to pull this off. This is why we need your help.<br/></b><br/>With your support, 2015 is going to be our biggest year yet, with our film festival expanding an extra day, a bigger venue to screen in (The Bloor Hot Docs Cinema) and bigger audiences. Your backing will help important human rights films and discussions gain an audience in Toronto and create the kinds of spaces necessary to explore and imagine a better and more just world for everyone. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""></p>
<h2>Human rights stories are everywhere.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445885794/umy8dbiipnfd2unulqk0.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
</h2>
<p>Our world is full of human rights stories. On a trip to North Korea in 2008, I began to learn about the horrific injustices that were affecting an entire nation: modern day concentration camps, a famine that took the lives of millions and much more. I became obsessed with not just learning more about these stories but trying to share them with as many people as I could. My mission was to get people to care as much as I did because if positive social change were to ever happen, people had to be aware that there was an issue there in the first place. And more often than not, it didn't work.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px;""><b>How art can change the world.  </b></span></p>

</h2>
<p>All of that changed by chance when I saw the power of a documentary film on North Korea convince a group of people in a room to care. This is when I learned that art was the best way to get through to people. Art is accessible, can build empathy, take us to new places and most importantly, create an environment and safe place where people can come together to engage in the kinds of dialogue that are necessary for positive social change. </p>
<p>With this knowledge, I immediately assembled a team of passionate individuals in 2012 including artists, human rights advocates, and people with film festival experience and launched our first ever Human Rights Film Festival in 2012. And it was a huge success! Just check out the growth: <br/><br/></p>

</li></ul>
<p>Since then, our mission has brought us to nearly a dozen schools and students across North America, several national and international media outlets, and even the United Nations Human Rights Assembly in Geneva. <b>Most importantly, we’ve been able to share human rights stories with tens of thousands of people and continue to see our mission grow and reach new communities each year. </b></p>
<h2>We Need Your Support to Continue Sharing Human Rights Stories!  </h2>

WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT, WE RISK LOSING OUR 4TH ANNUAL HUMAN RIGHTS FILM FESTIVAL

 
In 2012, we had a eureka moment when we discovered that art was the best way to raise awareness of human rights stories and we launched our first ever Human Rights Film Festival in downtown Toronto. Each year, our Festival has grown by leaps and bounds, attracting more audience members, while collaborating with more partners and changemakers to provide a platform for people to share their human rights stories through the arts. In 2014 we had 19 Films, 13 Premieres, 21 Community Partners, 16 Countries in Focus, 1,380 Attendees, nearly triple the amount since we launched in 2012.
Everything was going according to plan for our 4th annual Film Festival when at the last minute one of our major backers had to unexpectedly pull out. We were completely blindsided, but we are determined to pull this off. This is why we need your help.With your support, 2015 is going to be our biggest year yet, with our film festival expanding an extra day, a bigger venue to screen in (The Bloor Hot Docs Cinema) and bigger audiences. Your backing will help important human rights films and discussions gain an audience in Toronto and create the kinds of spaces necessary to explore and imagine a better and more just world for everyone. 

Human rights stories are everywhere.

Our world is full of human rights stories. On a trip to North Korea in 2008, I began to learn about the horrific injustices that were affecting an entire nation: modern day concentration camps, a famine that took the lives of millions and much more. I became obsessed with not just learning more about these stories but trying to share them with as many people as I could. My mission was to get people to care as much as I did because if positive social change were to ever happen, people had to be aware that there was an issue there in the first place. And more often than not, it didn't work.

How art can change the world.  



All of that changed by chance when I saw the power of a documentary film on North Korea convince a group of people in a room to care. This is when I learned that art was the best way to get through to people. Art is accessible, can build empathy, take us to new places and most importantly, create an environment and safe place where people can come together to engage in the kinds of dialogue that are necessary for positive social change. 
With this knowledge, I immediately assembled a team of passionate individuals in 2012 including artists, human rights advocates, and people with film festival experience and launched our first ever Human Rights Film Festival in 2012. And it was a huge success! Just check out the growth: 

2012 FILM FESTIVAL: 7 Films, 1 Premiere, 5 Community Partners, 1 Country in Focus, 560 Attendance 

2013 FILM FESTIVAL: 9 Films, 3 Premieres, 7 Community Partners, 1 Country in Focus, 790 Attendance 

2014 FILM FESTIVAL: 19 Films, 13 Premieres, 21 Community Partners, 16 Countries in Focus, 1,380 Attendance

Since then, our mission has brought us to nearly a dozen schools and students across North America, several national and international media outlets, and even the United Nations Human Rights Assembly in Geneva. Most importantly, we’ve been able to share human rights stories with tens of thousands of people and continue to see our mission grow and reach new communities each year. 
We Need Your Support to Continue Sharing Human Rights Stories!  

Despite all of these successes, we risk losing our 4th Annual Human Rights Film Festival from December 10-13, 2015 due to lost funding that was beyond our control. We learned in late October that we lost our Lead Sponsor due to budgeting cuts on their end and this has left us with a huge hole to fill. Without the support of our community, we face the harsh reality that there may not be a Film Festival this December. 
The good news? We’re a team of very dedicated individuals (read below), our network continues to grow year after year, and we’re confident that with your support, we’ll be able to reach our $15,000 goal.  
Beyond Film: We Do So Much More! 

We are so much more than just a Human Rights Film Festival and in 2015, we were so proud to launch and expand on three new programs. This speaks to our incredible potential and growth. These programs include: 
JAYU Speaks: launched in late 2014, this monthly speaker series provides the platform for local artists, and individuals to share their local human rights stories. To date, we've held 11 events focusing on issues like: refugees, institutionalized racism, women's rights, security certificates, and much more. We've invited nearly 50 guests to share their stories with more than 400 audience members. 

The Hum Podcast: Even in silence, there is always a hum in the background but you often only notice it if you're paying attention. The Hum is a metaphor for human rights stories all around us: we only notice them if we want to. This podcast will rebrand the way we talk about human rights. Hosted by award-winning documentary filmmaker Amar Wala, and Gilad Cohen, The Hum will launch in 2015/2016. 

Photography Mentorship Program / #CaptureTheStreets: In 2015, we collaborated with six very talented local photographers (@SoTeeOh, @chinpua, @tahaphoto, @g_wah, @gummyting, @normster), Community Story Strategies, and Horizons for Youth and provided the mentorship and safe space where the youth participants became empowered to share their artwork and personal stories through photography. We displayed the participant's best photos in three rotating galleries across Toronto, attracting more than 1,500 people and raising more than $4,000, with 100% of the profits going back to the youth. 
Our Stretch Goals.


Why continuing to support us if we surpass our $15,000 goal is so important. 


If we reach our $15,000 goal, we don't want the support to stop! With additional donations, we'll be able to do even more in 2016 including: Mentoring even more communities through the arts: We hope to collaborate with more artists, organizations and changemakers to provide safe spaces and mentorship where we can empower even more at-risk and marginalized communities through the arts. We want to take the lessons and successes we gained from our 2015 Photography Mentorship Program and do the project all over again with communities all across the province in places like Thunder Bay, Windsor, Ottawa and more! 

Supporting and expanding our existing platforms: With additional support, you'll help ensure that we can provide the spaces necessary to engage our community in dialogue through our JAYU Speaks and The Hum programs. 

A year-round presence: We're dedicated, passionate and we love what we do! We believe so strongly in JAYU's mission that we want to make sure we continue to have a year-round presence in our community. Your support will help ensure that we can do just that! 

We're the right people!

<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<p>I am a traditional watercolor artist who really enjoys making things like stickers and greeting cards that anyone can enjoy.

The problem is that once I have printed my stickers I then have to cut to cut them out by hand. </p>

<h2>What's The Money for?</h2>
<p>My goal is to raise enough money to buy an electric cutting machine that would give me the ability to make perfect cuts for my stickers. This would take the sticker collections I sell to a more professional level.  The machine I have my eye on is the Brother ScanNCut Machine (Cost approx. $650 plus tax, plus shipping). It is one of the more pricier machines but has features I feel would greatly benefit my small art business. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What Do You Get?</h2>
<p>I so greatly appreciate your support. I am setting my start goal at <strong>$300</strong> which will cover less than half the cost of the machine. If I reach my goal, everyone who has backed the project will receive:</p>
<ul><li>5 sheets of stickers ($10* contribution gets you $25 worth of stickers) designed by me!</li></ul>
<p>If I manage to double my goal then I will double the amount of stickers that go out. <strong>$600</strong> means everyone who backs this project will now get:</p>
<ul><li>10 different sheets of stickers (that's $50 worth of stickers for each $10* contribution).  </li></ul>

Hi; my name is Ken j. Martin. I am a Singer—Songwriter/ Theater Producer/ Community Activist/ Guitar Instructor, but the title that I prefer is ARTIST. For those who don’t know me, I have been performing for over 7 years as a national touring artist fusing acoustic melodies with sultry vocals. I am humbled to have been featured on BET's Lyric Cafe, The Monique Show, and other notable venues across the United States.
Currently, I am creating 4 shows at the Southwest Performing Art Center located in Atlanta, GA for the fall theater season that deals with what I call “undiscussable topics” within diverse communities that features amazing local talent whose performances bring the stories of the everyday person to life. I have been working to make this showcase the success it has become thus far for 6 years. It has been my greatest joy to provide socially conscious artists a space where we can produce change in our communities through art. 
Your generous contribution will aid us with the last piece of financial support we will need to fully operate and sustain the project as well as the artists who are bringing this production into existence. Ultimately, we cannot allow this effort to be a fully government supported venture; the show must be supported by those who believe in our cause! We are pressing towards the mark of becoming a self-sufficient community of artists and art lovers and we need you to help us. 
We are asking for just $20 dollars from 400 people to produce $8000 which will pay for all the operational expenses to run our showcase from light and sound production to theatre space rental. The residual income from ticket sells will fund our expansion to college campuses and national festivals. Your support will help create a REAL movement! It will create a REVIVAL of art with PURPOSE from genuine people seeking change in our world by first changing the false ideas in our communities rather than fame without positive impact. 
Prizes
For those that wish to give more we have created some prizes that show our appreciation and that will allow you to support the art community beyond your monetary gift.
50 dollars will get you a ATLANTA RENT SHOW T-Shirt to wear and promote our AWESOME endeavor!
100 dollars gets you a Season Pass to the Atlanta Rent Show!
200 dollars: Season Pass for two and a T- Shirt, so that you can introduce a friend to exceptional art.
The Impact
This campaign will allow us the opportunity to reach our fundraising goals for the year. Your generous support will have catapulted starving artists to success. With your support you will allow the type of artists that you want to represent you—truth tellers and humble people with a conscious—to do so adequately. There is no other campaign on Indiegogo.com like this. I am sure of it.

<p><span>In 2008, I moved to a large city for an Art Teaching Position--My Dream. Even though I was teaching Art I got caught up in a very precarious situation that led me to doubt myself and lose my spirit.  If you’ve ever lost yourself or aren't living with personal SPIRIT Awareness, you know exactly what I'm talking about. In order to regain my authentic self, I had to quit my job and move back to my hometown, after falling into deep depression and falling out of touch with everyone I knew by choice.  I was doing the daily search of finding another teaching position but couldn't &amp; haven’t.  I’m creating my DREAMS Right Here, Right Now!</span></p>

Biography:
Carrie B! Cottrill, M.Ed.:  Unemployed Licenced EC-12 Art Teacher with a Diverse Background in Psychology & Art. Former Crisis Counselor & the Founder of Meditate to Create© & Intentional Living© Programs. 
I’ve taught at Several Institutions & Organizations, Hospitals, Chiropractors Offices, Eastern Michigan University, Southwest Institute of Healing Arts, Ohio University and ASU, Mesa Community College, Yoga Conference Presenter.
In 2008, I moved to a large city for an Art Teaching Position--My Dream. Even though I was teaching Art I got caught up in a very precarious situation that led me to doubt myself and lose my spirit.  If you’ve ever lost yourself or aren't living with personal SPIRIT Awareness, you know exactly what I'm talking about. In order to regain my authentic self, I had to quit my job and move back to my hometown, after falling into deep depression and falling out of touch with everyone I knew by choice.  I was doing the daily search of finding another teaching position but couldn't & haven’t.  I’m creating my DREAMS Right Here, Right Now!
So I Create:   
                                 Find & Enjoy my Bhakti Jewels
 

  
Find Your Place.       Find Yourself.       Find the Love by Giving & Receiving.

❐ Fact Sheet About the Benefits of Arts Education for Children
*Benefits of Arts EducationSource: Americans for the Arts, 2002

Stimulates and develops the imagination and critical thinking, and refines cognitive and creative skills.
Has a tremendous impact on the developmental growth of every child and has proven to help level the ""learning field"" across socio-economic boundaries.
Strengthens problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, adding to overall academic achievement and school success.
Develops a sense of craftsmanship, quality task performance, and goal-setting—skills needed to succeed in the classroom and beyond.
Teaches children life skills such as developing an informed perception; articulating a vision; learning to solve problems and make decisions; building self-confidence and self-discipline; developing the ability to imagine what might be; and accepting responsibility to complete tasks from start to finish.
Nurtures important values, including team-building skills; respecting alternative viewpoints; and appreciating and being aware of different cultures and traditions.
Source: Young Children and the Arts: Making Creative Connections, 1998, Introduction

Plays a central role in cognitive, motor, language, and social-emotional development.
Motivates and engages children in learning, stimulates memory, facilitates understanding, enhances symbolic communication, promotes relationships, and provides an avenue for building competence.
Provides a natural source of learning. Child development specialists note that play is the business of young children; play is the way children promote and enhance their development. The arts are a most natural vehicle for play.
The Need in Preschools  Source: Americans for the Arts, 2002

Preschool care and education, except for certain low-income programs, is considered a private service and receives little or no federal funding.
While the importance of early childhood arts education has received greater attention in recent years, the majority of funding and programming is directed to grades K–12, with preschools being largely underserved.
Arts education should not be considered a frill, but a necessity. Since preschools are not part of the public school system, funding sources vary greatly. When budgets are tight, arts programs, teachers, and supplies are often cut first.
More than four million children attend preschool programs nationwide.
Source: Arts Education Partnership, Children’s Learning & the Arts: Birth to Age Eight

Preschool-age children are primed for learning and greatly accepting of most art forms.
Compelling evidence exists that early arts experience has an impact on all aspects of a child’s learning and development and that, in many ways, “earlier is better.”
Early childhood thus presents both a unique opportunity and a unique challenge; a part of that challenge is to engage and support all who care for and educate young children in making the arts an integrated and vital part of their earliest experiences.
We know that ""art,"" understood as spontaneous creative play, is what young children naturally do—singing, dancing, drawing, and role-playing. We also know that the arts engage all the senses and involve a variety of modalities including the kinesthetic, auditory, and visual. When caregivers engage and encourage children in arts activities on a regular basis from early in life, they are laying the foundation for—and even helping wire children's brains for—successful learning.

<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>In Spring 2017, North Wales will host ""Fragments from Syria"" a unique collection  of contemporary Syrian art, collated in partnership by Syria.Art and Dr Zigs/Bubbles Not Bombs.</p>
<p>The week-long exhibition in Bangor, Gwynedd, will feature fine art in various forms, reflecting the diversity and creativity of Syrian artists at work in 2017. </p>
<p>The event will promote artists still resident in Syria, as well as those among the diaspora, providing them with a unique, shared platform from which their work will engage with local, national and international audiences. </p>
<p>The featured work will provoke discourse of the current affairs in Syria, as well as explorations of the power of art in healing, and of culture as being of vital importance in times of chaos. The collection is sure to provide an enriched understanding and appreciation among the public of the artistic heritage within Syria, reflected in these contemporary works. </p>
<p>The exhibition will begin with a launch event (see rewards) at which guests will have the opportunity to purchase the works of art, before an online auction is later opened, to audiences worldwide.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Background</strong></p>
<p>Amid the horrors of Syria's civil war, hundreds of thousands of citizens have been killed and millions more displaced. This ancient nation of learning and art, of discovery and philosophy has been ravaged by warring factions while the world looks on. </p>
<p>We have seen from afar the buildings destroyed, the thousands of people on-foot, searching for safety - the rows and rows of white tents in camps, housing those who managed to escape.</p>
<p>What can remain, in such a place? What can carry on, amid such chaos? What is left, after such loss?</p>
<p>Van Gogh once said - ""Art is to console those who are broken by life"". The motivation for this collaboration is to showcase inspiring artwork, and also to celebrate the impact art can have (on both artists and audiences) in times of war, and of turmoil. </p>
<p>Khaled Youssef founded ""Syria.Art"" to serve the Syrian artistic community - while living in France and working as a surgeon, he devotes himself to seeking out new platforms to promote Syrian artists, curating exhibitions and building networks of support.</p>
<p>""During troubled times"", says Khaled, it is ""essential to offer another vision of Syria through its culture and the artistic creation of its artists.""</p>
<p>Syria.Art has previously brought together collected visual works by established and emerging Syrian artists, hosted in both traditional galleries and on innovative online platforms. It has launched ""Jasmin, une autre Syrie"" - a web-based collection of art, poetry and other forms of literature, published quarterly in both French and English to explore the history, and cultural heritage of Syria.</p>
<p><strong>Featured Artists</strong></p>
<p>We are extremely proud to have secured contributions from the following artists, some living in Syria, some in Europe and other countries around the world:<br/> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>We are aiming to raise £8000 which will cover the cost of</p>
<p>- shipping original artwork/installations into the UK</p>
<p>- reproducing prints of other artwork submitted electronically</p>
<p>- displaying / framing/ hanging all artwork</p>
<p>- hosting events and talks as part of the exhibition</p>

<p>- hosting the online auction and sending-out artworks to the highest bidders</p>
<p>- covering organisational costs</p>
<p>- any funds remaining at the end of the project will be donated directly tp Syria.Art</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Rewards</strong></p>
<p>We have some great rewards lined-up in honour of the pledges we hope to receive, covering a range of small to large pledges. We are keeping the costs of these rewards low and their environmental impact in terms of air miles etc at a minimum. We hope you will find something that helps you to connect with this project and to keep as a lasting token of thanks for your support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are unable to pledge financially, and/or if you are not near enough to Bangor to be able to attend the exhibition, here are some key ways to get involved and how your support:</p>
<p>- Share this crowdfunding campaign with your online networks</p>
<p>- Share the event page when it goes live on Facebook </p>
<p>- Follow the online accounts of the featured artists and support their work</p>
<p>- Go to <a href=""http://www.en.syriaartasso.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.en.syriaartasso.com</a> for details of previous and ongoing projects. and to see how you can show ongoing support, share information about their work, and enjoy the current projects for yourself</p>
<p>- Ask the artistic community in your area if they would consider hosting a similar exhibition in collaboration with Syria.Art</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Our hope is that once gathered and brought to public attention, this collection of powerful work will be invited to other towns and cities in Europe.</p>
<p>The auctions will be an opportunity to artists to fund their work and their development into the future. </p>
<p>The exposure for the featured artists will provide them with future avenues for support and recognition</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>There is a chance that we may raise less funding than we hope to, in which case the exhibition may have to be reduced in size and scope. </p>
<p>We very much want the exhibition to be free for the public to view, but we may have to request a small entry fee to make the project possible, if we are unable to raise the funding we need. </p>

<h3><strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON’T MAKE IT?</strong></h3>
<p>We don’t want this year to be the last, so let’s reach &amp; exceed the goal to ensure that we can keep creating festivals for decades to come, without being reliant on outside funding. Remember, the DF team works voluntarily, so all money raised goes straight into the cost of the Festival.  If we don’t make the funding goal then the festivals future will remain uncertain &amp; won’t be able to achieve everything we have planned for the event this year. However we shall KEEP THE DREAM ALIVE!</p>
<h3><strong>DOES MY DONATION REALLY MAKE A DIFFERNCE?</strong></h3>
<p>It goes without saying, that Dragonlfy Festival wouldn’t be what it is without you.

Now its time to build on this amazing support &amp; ask you to contribute a little, &amp; together we can achieve a lot.</p>
<h3><strong>WHAT IS MY MONEY GOING TO BE USED FOR?</strong></h3>
<p>Your donation will go towards the total cost of the festival, including artists fees, equipment, production costs, toilets,,,,,you name it! Please remember – none of us worker bees get paid, so your cash will go straight into the pot to cover the overall costs of the unique weekend event.</p>

It is now a community-led festival, with a dedicated team of skilled volunteers with a passion to create a cultural arts platform nestled within Sweden’s breath taking landscape.
Dragonfly Festival exists to promote the value of creative practice & celebrate diverse musical & artistic styles. It is truly a unique event – a breath of fresh air in the festival climate.

</h3> <p>My name is Juan C and with my team mates from the University of the Philippines Pep Squad, we will be representing our school and our country  as Team Philippines in this year's Cheerleading World Championships. <br/></p>
<p>We have earned our eligibility to compete again this year, as we have successfully done in past championships; we have been training for many months, and we are very eager to face this competition with utmost pride and passion. In addition to training and leveling -up our skills, we have another challenge:<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>We Need to Reach in Berlin. </h3>The 8th CWC, happens every two years, hosted and organized by the International Federation of Cheerleading, and will take place at the Max-Schmeling Halle in Berlin, Germany,<br/><br/>This campaign aims to raise funds to be able to afford the trip that will help us defend our country's place as top contenders.  In the past years, Team Philippines has surprised the world by winning the bronze medal in the Mixed Team Cheer division, on its first time to qualify for the World Championships in Hong Kong. This award was successfully reclaimed during the last CWC in Bangkok, Thailand, and in addition, another bronze medal for the Mixed Group Stunt Category. The highest our country has gone in the World Championships.<br/><p>Along with 47 delegates from our university, including me as one of the coaches and over 40 full-time student-athletes, we are on a mission to prove that despite challenges in school, in finances, and in athletic advantages, the PHILIPPINES CAN PRODUCE STUDENT-ATHLETES worthy of the world's attention and respect.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>For The Love Of...<br/>
</h3>

 My name is Juan C and with my team mates from the University of the Philippines Pep Squad, we will be representing our school and our country  as Team Philippines in this year's Cheerleading World Championships. 
We have earned our eligibility to compete again this year, as we have successfully done in past championships; we have been training for many months, and we are very eager to face this competition with utmost pride and passion. In addition to training and leveling -up our skills, we have another challenge:

We Need to Reach in Berlin. The 8th CWC, happens every two years, hosted and organized by the International Federation of Cheerleading, and will take place at the Max-Schmeling Halle in Berlin, Germany,This campaign aims to raise funds to be able to afford the trip that will help us defend our country's place as top contenders.  In the past years, Team Philippines has surprised the world by winning the bronze medal in the Mixed Team Cheer division, on its first time to qualify for the World Championships in Hong Kong. This award was successfully reclaimed during the last CWC in Bangkok, Thailand, and in addition, another bronze medal for the Mixed Group Stunt Category. The highest our country has gone in the World Championships.Along with 47 delegates from our university, including me as one of the coaches and over 40 full-time student-athletes, we are on a mission to prove that despite challenges in school, in finances, and in athletic advantages, the PHILIPPINES CAN PRODUCE STUDENT-ATHLETES worthy of the world's attention and respect.

For The Love Of...

At their finest, athletes are backed up by huge sponsorships, training facilities and the luxury of training time. 
Our team, however, makes use of our committed training time after school hours - everyday, we work within our university's budget, we reach out to supportive alumni for necessary equipment, and we survive with our eagerness and enthusiasm from our students and coaches, helping us maintain our place as the only goverment-funded students contending against privately-sponsored teams.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> </div><h3>Short Summary</h3><div> </div><p>So, many of you know me, Dean Montalbano.... and those who do know that</p><ul>
<li>I have an artists soul</li>
<li>I have been smothering in my ""day Job"" for the last 10 years and...</li>
<li>it is killing me!</li>
</ul><p>I have a chance, almost too good to be true, to open a gallery space showcasing my Face and body art, sculpture, masks, puppets, costumes and more- all in ONE space and in a busy arts community smack in the middle of the International Drive tourist area of Orlando Florida.  </p><div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>In order to open this space, I need more capital than I have.  The last few years have been very difficult on every level- personally, professionally emotionally and spiritually- and now is a time of healing.  But I am still in a defecit so I need a little hand up.</p>
<p>Between now and the October opening I need to obtain licenses,  displays, create inventory, prepare our full color book/ catalog, make tons of stock, prepare flyers, business cards, and more.</p>
<p>I am planning a line of paper mache and leather art masks, that can also double as steam punk costume pieces.  Small hand made gothic utility kilts, gauntlets and sculpted pieces along with molded leather puppets of all kinds will make this a visually amazing store. But this needs materials.</p>
<p>In addition, the offering of live canvas art, body paints, rhinestone body art, and more- done both as performance pieces and custom work on live models, will make it an attraction.  But- for that we have to have plenty of makeup and materials on hand.</p>
<p>To fill the store with hand-made artisan soap, I need to spend MOST of September making the stuff,  which means buying gallons of oils, butters, micas and more to make sure the store smells and looks AMAZING!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We need to get large format prints made of my work and
more!  The grand opening of this space is
October 16th, and we only get once chance to make a grand impression.  This means the world to me.</p>
<h1>The Impact</h1>
</div><div> <p>Ok so, on an artistic level, I really think that putting body painting into a mainstream environment will offer a new visual and creative experience to millions of people.  With Orlando being a crossroad for the whole world, people from all over will have an opportunity to see, buy and EXPERIENCE live face and body art that goes BEYOND the theme park bunny rabbit.</p>
<p>On a personal note-  this really is the reset I have needed.  I don't want to offer a sob story, but for the first time in years, I am looking forward to tomorrow.  I see a place about to form that both welcomes and values the creative content I have and can allow me to share that creativity with others, make a living, and leave behind an environment that has been stifling and limiting.</p>
<p>It also will offer me a way back to fulfill obligations to authors and people from the magic world who did a lot to help me long ago.</p>
<p>In short- It's a way back to life.<br/></p> <ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> To make this work, it has to be full time all or nothing.  I have to not only stay unique and interesting, I have to keep the space filled with things for people to see, buy and enjoy!</p>
<p>I will be leaving my safety net, my full time job of 22 years and jumping on a leap of faith.<br/></p> <ul>
<li>I've done it before and made it work</li>
<li>I share this dream with many other artists and vendors who will be participating in this space with their own visions.</li>
<li>We are backed by one of the largest developers, and biggest re-developed mall properties in the Orlando area and they WANT us to succeed ad well.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li> If that's you-  THANKS for at least reading this far.  Any encouragement or positive energy you can spare to send my way will be appreciated!<br/>
</li>

</div> <p><br/></p></div>","Short Summary So, many of you know me, Dean Montalbano.... and those who do know that
I have an artists soul
I have been smothering in my ""day Job"" for the last 10 years and...
it is killing me!
I have a chance, almost too good to be true, to open a gallery space showcasing my Face and body art, sculpture, masks, puppets, costumes and more- all in ONE space and in a busy arts community smack in the middle of the International Drive tourist area of Orlando Florida.     What We Need & What You Get In order to open this space, I need more capital than I have.  The last few years have been very difficult on every level- personally, professionally emotionally and spiritually- and now is a time of healing.  But I am still in a defecit so I need a little hand up.
Between now and the October opening I need to obtain licenses,  displays, create inventory, prepare our full color book/ catalog, make tons of stock, prepare flyers, business cards, and more.
I am planning a line of paper mache and leather art masks, that can also double as steam punk costume pieces.  Small hand made gothic utility kilts, gauntlets and sculpted pieces along with molded leather puppets of all kinds will make this a visually amazing store. But this needs materials.
In addition, the offering of live canvas art, body paints, rhinestone body art, and more- done both as performance pieces and custom work on live models, will make it an attraction.  But- for that we have to have plenty of makeup and materials on hand.
To fill the store with hand-made artisan soap, I need to spend MOST of September making the stuff,  which means buying gallons of oils, butters, micas and more to make sure the store smells and looks AMAZING!


We need to get large format prints made of my work and
more!  The grand opening of this space is
October 16th, and we only get once chance to make a grand impression.  This means the world to me.
The Impact
 Ok so, on an artistic level, I really think that putting body painting into a mainstream environment will offer a new visual and creative experience to millions of people.  With Orlando being a crossroad for the whole world, people from all over will have an opportunity to see, buy and EXPERIENCE live face and body art that goes BEYOND the theme park bunny rabbit.
On a personal note-  this really is the reset I have needed.  I don't want to offer a sob story, but for the first time in years, I am looking forward to tomorrow.  I see a place about to form that both welcomes and values the creative content I have and can allow me to share that creativity with others, make a living, and leave behind an environment that has been stifling and limiting.
It also will offer me a way back to fulfill obligations to authors and people from the magic world who did a lot to help me long ago.
In short- It's a way back to life. 
  Risks & Challenges  To make this work, it has to be full time all or nothing.  I have to not only stay unique and interesting, I have to keep the space filled with things for people to see, buy and enjoy!
I will be leaving my safety net, my full time job of 22 years and jumping on a leap of faith. 
I've done it before and made it work
I share this dream with many other artists and vendors who will be participating in this space with their own visions.
We are backed by one of the largest developers, and biggest re-developed mall properties in the Orlando area and they WANT us to succeed ad well.


  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

 If that's you-  THANKS for at least reading this far.  Any encouragement or positive energy you can spare to send my way will be appreciated!

Why do I need a tablet?

Every day I get closer to achieving my dream of being a full-time, professional artist.I spend hours and hours during those days drawing and painting, working to become the best artist I can be. With more and more work coming in with bigger and better projects, I have found that I cannot work to my potential with my current tools.
Today, being able to digitally work on your art is a necessity. Every professional project I have done has required me to ink, tone, color, and even draw, digitally.

My ideal tablet is the Cintiq 22"" HD Touch. It retails at $2,500.If I get maximum funding the other $500 will go towards cables, tax and whatever other fees that turn up.

<p>The
sculpture, Nurturing, in front of Hillsides’ administration building looks
pretty much as the finished sculpture will look when cast in bronze.   Jesse at the foundry described how the patinating process would
pretty closely match the color of the redwood, even duplicating dark streaks of
grain.  Through this website,  igg.me/at/goyo/x/3125557  I am asking for
donations for the bronze casting and building the pedestal on which it will
stand.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Greg’s Background</b><br/></p>
<p>For
many years, I worked at Ventura Community College  as English/ESL instructor and sculpted wood as a part time  pleasure. On retirement, I discovered
that experimenting with sculpture was how I wished to use these extra leisure
hours.</p>
<p>I
am not a trained sculptor, which probably contributes to how I carve. I see
that everything is connected, and that wood has the same spirit as I do - this
thing - has, or a rock, or a leaf has.</p>
<p>In
carving a piece of wood, I look to see what the wood wants to become, and as I
work I see the wood’s spirit emerge. The piece starts to come alive, and at its
completion it is ready to interact with us, other spirits.</p>
<p><a href=""https://vimeo.com/user19954874"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b></b></a>
</p>
<p><b>Greg Marquez, sculptor</b></p>
<b></b>
<p>“Nurturing” was created
through an unusual series of events. Clearing away the dead and unwanted wood
and bark, the piece reached a point where I was stuck. The wood wasn’t
responding. I couldn’t see what it wanted to become. There was something there,
but I couldn’t see it. This went on for a couple of months while I kept busy on
another piece. Finally, after a couple of months and while reading a book that
described looping, the sculpture suddenly became clear.</p>
<p>But first, looping. In the
book, the author described how in nature, a looping feedback process occurs in
many situations, and the development of the human brain is a good example. As
the reptilian brain - at the level of eat or be eaten - evolved over millions
of years to include mammalian - caring and family concern - the new capacities
were looped back to the reptilian, thereby supplementing the basics from which
the new mammalian would grow.</p>
<p>Then one day, looking at the sculpture
again, the intuition came, and it was obvious. There was one piece of root, but
two figures rising out of it. And the theme was evident. A mother is nurturing
its infant, and on a different scale, the child the mother. Looping was in
action, and in addition, the piece represented the classic wisdom of the many
as one and one as many, both simultaneously.</p>
<p>This experience of discovery
left me with such an indelible insight into the world and its workings that I
didn’t feel that the sculpture was mine, but rather it existed through me. I
was its transforming instrument, and its transformative experience needed to be
shared.</p>
<p>Hillsides seemed to be an
ideal site for this purpose, and when I offered it to them, it was immediately
accepted. Joe, who heads Hillsides was very gracious in thanking me. I
felt I should be thanking him for his giving Nurturing a home.</p>

<p><b>What Are We Doing</b></p>
<p>Let's start of by telling you what I'm NOT doing.  I'm not making potato salad.  I'm not making cookies or paper airplanes and I'm not going to draw you an ugly tree.</p><p>I did wrestle with the decision for where to post this campaign.  We are a fledgling small business but this is really all about the art - creating unique objects out of glass.<br/></p><p>There was a time when the trade of glassblowing was an elite
pursuit dominated by craftsmen in the City of Venice, Italy - most notably on
the island of Murano.  In modern times,
although the glassblowing trade has expanded to major cities around the world,
the fascination with glassblowing, of creating works of art out of molten
glass, is not limited to the larger centers of population.  We face that challenge here in the
Tri-Cities, a mostly agricultural grouping of communities in south-central
Washington State.  The only way we can
pursue the glassblowing arts is by traveling several hours to Seattle or
Portland, just to find a studio with the necessary equipment.  The goal of this campaign is to
bring the ancient art of Venetian glassblowing to our community.</p>
<p><b>Why Are We Doing This</b></p>
<p>Starting a glassblowing studio from scratch is not an
inexpensive undertaking.  Economies can
be achieved by limiting the size of the basic equipment - the path we've chosen
to take.  Whereas a commercial studio can
easily spend $200,000 or more for the melting furnace, glory holes and
annealers, our fully functional studio will acquire these pieces of equipment,
along with some supporting equipment like pipe warmers, pipe coolers and the glassblower's
bench, for under $20,000.  I have already
ordered that equipment and expect delivery for most of the equipment is by September, 2014.  This equipment is not a part of this campaign - I have been preparing for the day when I can open a glassblowing
studio and the cost of the larger pieces of equipment is already covered.</p>
<p><b>How Can You Help?</b></p>
<p>With the larger pieces of equipment in place, there still
remains a significant cost to make the studio operational.  This campaign is intended to help
fund the purchase of the supporting equipment. 
To give you an idea of where the campaign funds will be used, here's a
brief list (with approximate prices) for the basic tools that are needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optic molds
(for shaping molten glass)  $  250 each</li>
<li>Wood Paddles  $
30 each</li>
<li>Swedish
Blocks  $  100 each</li>
<li>Round Blocks  $  75
each</li>
<li>Blow Pipes  $  175 each</li>
<li>Punty Rods
(solid pipes)  $  100 each</li>
<li>Hot Glass
Shears  $  175 each</li>
<li>Trim Shears  $
85 each</li>
<li>Crimping and
Flattening Tools  $  80 each</li>
<li>Jacks
(large, specially-designed ""tweezers"")  $  250 each</li>
<li>Pastorelli
Plates and Carriers  $  425 </li>
<li>Lap Grinder
&amp; Grinding Discs  $2,150</li>
<li>Safety Clothing (heat-resistant jacket, apron, gloves)  $ 
500</li>
</ul><p>To provide the basic tooling for the most basic of studios
is estimated to cost around $6,000. 
Then, even with the tooling and equipment in place, various forms of
glass are needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Glass Cullet
(crushed glass for the furnace)  $1,200</li>
<li>Glass Frit and Powders (adds color to the finished glass art)  $2,500</li>
</ul><p>This brings us to the goal of this campaign - to
raise as much of the roughly $10,000 needed to finish furnishing a basic glassblowing studio with
the capabilities to create the pieces of glass art that will be used as rewards
for our backers.  I've set the goal for the campaign at the absolute minimum funding needed to get the most basic operations going.  I will attempt to cash-flow as much as possible and any additional funding will allow me to obtain more of the tools and supplies to create more art glass.<br/></p>
<p><b>What Do You Get For
Your Support?</b></p>
<p>For supporting our efforts to establish a traditional glassblowing studio in the Tri-Cities, you'll receive my sincere thanks and a bumper sticker.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/776344/files/20140809085913-bumpersticker.png?1407599953"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><p>Glass Ornament - One of our hand-made blown glass
ornaments, approximately 3"" in diameter, with an integral loop, for
hanging the ornament.  Are you a Redneck???  The color selections for the ornament rewards 
includes camouflage, 12th Man (Seahawks blue &amp; green), burgundy 
&amp; grey (WSU Cougar colors), and a few traditional Christmas color 
schemes.  You can decorate your Christmas tree or display the ornaments 
year-round.  Three reward levels are planned, for a single ornament and for two and four ornament sets.  (See images in Gallery)</p>
<p>Small Round Paperweight - One of our hand-made solid glass
round paperweights, approximately 3"" in diameter.  (See image in Gallery)<br/></p>
<p>Large Pyramid-Shaped Paperweight - One of our hand-made
solid glass pyramid-shaped paperweights, approximately 4"" in diameter and
4"" high.  (See image in Gallery)<br/></p>
<p>Glass Handkerchief (Ruffle-Edge) Bowl - One of our hand-made
blown glass handkerchief bowls, approximately 9"" across and 4"" high.  (See image in Gallery)<br/></p>
<p><b>Rewards Delivery</b></p>
<p>Production of the rewards cannot begin until the equipment
is set up and all the tools and glass have been purchased and delivered.  Most of the important equipment has arrived and should be installed and operational by the end
of September.  Running this campaign before the equipment is being placed in operation will allow me to place the
order for the remainder of the tools and a supply of clear and colored glass.  I anticipate that
production of the rewards will begin in early October. 
At this time, with no real gauge of how popular this campaign will be, I
have set the official rewards delivery date as December, 2014.  With the quantity limits I've set, there should be no problem with delivery of the rewards on-time.  If the participation exceeds my expectations, I will add additional rewards opportunities, however delivery for the new rewards categories will likely be after January 1, 2015.  Rewards items will be shipped as
soon as they are created and I will do my best to create them in the same order as when my
backers commit their funds to this campaign. 
What that means for my backers is that early participation will allow
for early delivery.<br/></p>
<p><b>Risks and Challenges</b></p>
<p>I've done my best to minimize any risks or challenges to the
success of this campaign and the delivery of the rewards.  Nearly all of the equipment, tools and glass
will be purchased from verified suppliers.

<p></p></div>","What Are We Doing
Let's start of by telling you what I'm NOT doing.  I'm not making potato salad.  I'm not making cookies or paper airplanes and I'm not going to draw you an ugly tree.I did wrestle with the decision for where to post this campaign.  We are a fledgling small business but this is really all about the art - creating unique objects out of glass.There was a time when the trade of glassblowing was an elite
pursuit dominated by craftsmen in the City of Venice, Italy - most notably on
the island of Murano.  In modern times,
although the glassblowing trade has expanded to major cities around the world,
the fascination with glassblowing, of creating works of art out of molten
glass, is not limited to the larger centers of population.  We face that challenge here in the
Tri-Cities, a mostly agricultural grouping of communities in south-central
Washington State.  The only way we can
pursue the glassblowing arts is by traveling several hours to Seattle or
Portland, just to find a studio with the necessary equipment.  The goal of this campaign is to
bring the ancient art of Venetian glassblowing to our community.
Why Are We Doing This
Starting a glassblowing studio from scratch is not an
inexpensive undertaking.  Economies can
be achieved by limiting the size of the basic equipment - the path we've chosen
to take.  Whereas a commercial studio can
easily spend $200,000 or more for the melting furnace, glory holes and
annealers, our fully functional studio will acquire these pieces of equipment,
along with some supporting equipment like pipe warmers, pipe coolers and the glassblower's
bench, for under $20,000.  I have already
ordered that equipment and expect delivery for most of the equipment is by September, 2014.  This equipment is not a part of this campaign - I have been preparing for the day when I can open a glassblowing
studio and the cost of the larger pieces of equipment is already covered.
How Can You Help?
With the larger pieces of equipment in place, there still
remains a significant cost to make the studio operational.  This campaign is intended to help
fund the purchase of the supporting equipment. 
To give you an idea of where the campaign funds will be used, here's a
brief list (with approximate prices) for the basic tools that are needed:

Optic molds
(for shaping molten glass)  $  250 each
Wood Paddles  $
30 each
Swedish
Blocks  $  100 each
Round Blocks  $  75
each
Blow Pipes  $  175 each
Punty Rods
(solid pipes)  $  100 each
Hot Glass
Shears  $  175 each
Trim Shears  $
85 each
Crimping and
Flattening Tools  $  80 each
Jacks
(large, specially-designed ""tweezers"")  $  250 each
Pastorelli
Plates and Carriers  $  425 
Lap Grinder
& Grinding Discs  $2,150
Safety Clothing (heat-resistant jacket, apron, gloves)  $ 
500
To provide the basic tooling for the most basic of studios
is estimated to cost around $6,000. 
Then, even with the tooling and equipment in place, various forms of
glass are needed.

Glass Cullet
(crushed glass for the furnace)  $1,200
Glass Frit and Powders (adds color to the finished glass art)  $2,500
This brings us to the goal of this campaign - to
raise as much of the roughly $10,000 needed to finish furnishing a basic glassblowing studio with
the capabilities to create the pieces of glass art that will be used as rewards
for our backers.  I've set the goal for the campaign at the absolute minimum funding needed to get the most basic operations going.  I will attempt to cash-flow as much as possible and any additional funding will allow me to obtain more of the tools and supplies to create more art glass.
What Do You Get For
Your Support?
For supporting our efforts to establish a traditional glassblowing studio in the Tri-Cities, you'll receive my sincere thanks and a bumper sticker.Glass Ornament - One of our hand-made blown glass
ornaments, approximately 3"" in diameter, with an integral loop, for
hanging the ornament.  Are you a Redneck???  The color selections for the ornament rewards 
includes camouflage, 12th Man (Seahawks blue & green), burgundy 
& grey (WSU Cougar colors), and a few traditional Christmas color 
schemes.  You can decorate your Christmas tree or display the ornaments 
year-round.  Three reward levels are planned, for a single ornament and for two and four ornament sets.  (See images in Gallery)
Small Round Paperweight - One of our hand-made solid glass
round paperweights, approximately 3"" in diameter.  (See image in Gallery)
Large Pyramid-Shaped Paperweight - One of our hand-made
solid glass pyramid-shaped paperweights, approximately 4"" in diameter and
4"" high.  (See image in Gallery)
Glass Handkerchief (Ruffle-Edge) Bowl - One of our hand-made
blown glass handkerchief bowls, approximately 9"" across and 4"" high.  (See image in Gallery)
Rewards Delivery
Production of the rewards cannot begin until the equipment
is set up and all the tools and glass have been purchased and delivered.  Most of the important equipment has arrived and should be installed and operational by the end
of September.  Running this campaign before the equipment is being placed in operation will allow me to place the
order for the remainder of the tools and a supply of clear and colored glass.  I anticipate that
production of the rewards will begin in early October. 
At this time, with no real gauge of how popular this campaign will be, I
have set the official rewards delivery date as December, 2014.  With the quantity limits I've set, there should be no problem with delivery of the rewards on-time.  If the participation exceeds my expectations, I will add additional rewards opportunities, however delivery for the new rewards categories will likely be after January 1, 2015.  Rewards items will be shipped as
soon as they are created and I will do my best to create them in the same order as when my
backers commit their funds to this campaign. 
What that means for my backers is that early participation will allow
for early delivery.
Risks and Challenges
I've done my best to minimize any risks or challenges to the
success of this campaign and the delivery of the rewards.  Nearly all of the equipment, tools and glass
will be purchased from verified suppliers. 
Two pieces of supporting equipment - the glassblower's bench and a
marver table - are being fabricated by local businesses.  The location for the glassblowing studio is
complete, including the special electrical power circuits and natural gas
supply piping. The only real risk (and
my challenge) is meeting the production schedule for the rewards items.",1.0,0,"3 Campaigns

One month of street performance/explorations, video art and installations inspired and supported by:

gentleness

To work with gentleness is to work with respect and listening. It is the idea that we do not need to push ourselves beyond our boundaries or look outside ourselves to ﬁnd strength. Our bodies themselves hold space for creativity. With gentleness we want to challenge this societal expectation and ground ourselves in self care, honor our physical limitations and tap into the space inwardly connecting. How will this affect our project? We will have daily physical practices (dance, walking, qi gong, BMC exercises), in our explorations we will respect our physical limitations, we will not strive to go beyond them but allow them to guide us more deeply into the layers of our bodies.

radical acceptance

Radical acceptance is the refusal of perfection. We believe that anything can be the support for our creative expression. We want to expose our vulnerability and be supported by the acceptance of our struggles, our sense of inadequacy and our fears. In this way, we want to enter a state of non-striving and allow ourselves to be. We will work with our personal yet deeply universal challenges, hardships, we will use our fears, our shame and sense of ‘not belonging’ to create explorations and performances. We will do movement and experiential explorations in the streets, parks, cemeteries, and historic cites of Paris which will lead to the creation of a  final street performance and a video performance.

ritualizing creativity into our daily lives

We desire to reintegrate art into the center of our lives and experience creative expression as inseparable to our daily living.

<p>Graveyards for unbaptisted children - on Achill Island, Ireland, Irland
          <br/></p><p>Since the mid fifties,
when I was a child and passed the summer months on Achill Island, I was very
impressed with the cillin on the Dookinella cliff tops. This was the only one
we knew of at this time. I remember, the new graves  that appeared there
right up until the end of the fifties, probably even the early sixties.</p>
<p>These memories never
escaped me and looking back on those days, through older eyes, I found myself
more and more interested in those unmarked graves and their meaning at the time
and in our current times. These reflections moved me to work on an artistic
project about the cilliní on Achill Island and the Currane peninsula.</p>
<p>Through personal
experience, I have learned of more than 20 cilliní on Achill and through my
research I have received notices of a further 15 on Currane. I have since
visited almost all of those on Achill and one on Currane, they are mostly
positioned near the coast. This project will take me on a journey back to
Achill and Currane and I intend on making an exhibition of my paintings,
silverpoint drawings, photos, Chinese ink paintings and drawings in 2014/2015.</p>
<p>I will make 15 large
oil paintings 160 x 179 cm in size, creating an installation of 5
triptichons. And this is where you come in. By donating my project I can make further research, paint a predella of 59 x 179 cm for each of the big painting, making it in total 30 paintings and publish an extendet catalogue with poems and literary and scientific texts about the cilliní. </p><p>Sponsor will receive perks and will be mentioned in the catalogue, big sponsors will be also mentioned on the invitation and the press release.</p><p>I am also grateful for all further information.</p><p>More about the cillini:<br/><a href=""http://irishfamilyresearch.blogspot.de/2012/02/who-is-buried-in-little-graveyards.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://irishfamilyresearch.blogspot.de/2012/02/who-is-buried-in-little-graveyards.html</a></p><p><a href=""http://celticburialrites.blogspot.de/2012_11_01_archive.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://celticburialrites.blogspot.de/2012_11_01_archive.html</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.academia.edu/602558/Deviant_Burial_in_the_Archaeological_Record"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.academia.edu/602558/Deviant_Burial_in_the_Archaeological_Record</a></p><p><br/></p>

This project is intended to honor the success of the franchise for many years to come. With your help, I'll be able to purchase and design a custom Switch compatible Controller for each and every fighter who has joined the battle in Ultimate. The controllers will be professionally photographed and compiled into an art book and sold at retail, so that fans all around the world can celebrate the franchise in a unique way for many generations to come! So Why IndieGogo?I have been making custom controllers for many years, and while I could make each one of these controllers over time, having the gaming communities support of the project upfront allows me set the appropriate amount of time and money aside to complete the project in a timely manner.Project Details Book Details8.5"" x 8.5"", Glossy Hard cover, 60lb paper stockController DetailsPro Game Controller for Switch, Motion Controls, HD Rumble, Charging Cable***Please note the controllers being used are NOT OEM controllers. They look and function exactly the same, but do not include NFC functionality. Backers will have the ability to upgrade to official OEM controllers at the end of the campaign for an additional $30 if our initial funding goal is reached. With the initial goal reached, I'll be able to purchase enough pro controllers for each and every character on the Ultimate Roster, which is just around 75 fighters at the current time. This initial goal funding takes into account the fact that some people may purchase more than one of a single character. For example, early bird backers get to choose their character. It is very possible that multiple early bird backers may choose one character, while no one may purchase another. This initial goal funding takes this into account, and guarantees that I'll have enough funding to create that character controller no one has shown love, even if no one has purchased it.   STRETCH GOALS ARE INCLUDED WITH EVERY CONTROLLER PLEDGED!If your rewards tier includes 5 controllers, you'll get 5 of each stretch goal item!$10,000 - Replacement joysticks with every controller UNLOCKED$12,000 - Rubber Grip Cap for joysticks with every controller UNLOCKED$15,000 - Controller Pins included with every controller tier!UNLOCKED$20,000 - Controller Carrying case with every controllerUNLOCKED$25,000 - Honorable Mentions will be added to the book UNLOCKED$35,000 - Pop Phone Grip$45,000 - Game Card Carrying Case$55,000 - Portable case for Game Console$65,000 - Game Convention Starter Kit $75,000 - To be determined...$85,000 - To be determined...$95,000 - ""Displai"" Stands from RoseColored GamingDesign Previews While over 75 characters will appear in this campaign, here is just a sneak preview of a few of them!We've teamed up with the great folks at RoseColoredGaming to bring you some amazing campaign exclusive ""displai"" stands for your Pro Controller!

<p><strong>SHORT PROJECT SUMMARY</strong><br/><br/>Hello from California's Eastern Sierra mountains! My name is Amara Untermeyer, I'm a California-based video artist and documentary filmmaker. My experience ranges from directing investigative documentary projects in Haiti, Indonesia and El Salvador, to working with human trafficking survivors and FBI heads, filming adventure programming for the History Channel, directing commercials for Ford and developing adventure television documentary series backed by Academy award winner, Viola Davis. </p>
<p>As a visual artist and storyteller, I have been deeply touched by the Eastern Sierra Nevada mountains in California, as well as her local communities. AMATOR MONTUM is a cinematic poem, provocation and deep dive into our own unique spiritual languages and communion with the mountains. With this free, public work I hope to present to the community an opportunity for deeper connection with self and Spirit, while broadening the connections and diverse spiritual dialogue with the mountains. AMATOR MONTUM is my personal, intimate invitation to go deeper - with ourselves, with others and with this sacred mountain region.</p>
<p>I created this project entirely on my own from my own pocket with no outside funding, and the project requires funding for the existence over the next 5 weeks, and your contribution will carry the this project beyond initial creation. I believe in free public art and I hope that, together, we can carry on this tradition of the arts being accessible to everyone!</p>

<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></p>
<p>I have personally self funded four weeks of development and coordination, six weeks of film production, three weeks of editing and purchased the video projection and screen gear on a humble artist's wages. The minimal goal of $3,300 that we're looking to raise goes entirely to post-production and gallery costs for the existence of this free public art installation. Below is a breakdown of the distribution of funds I must pay between Aug 2nd - Sep 1st, 2019 to the following vendors who have so helped to shape this project!: </p>
<p>$1,500 - audio design/soundscape/sound effects by Noctvrnal.com<br/>$400 - audio equipment rental - gallery speakers, subwoofer, video playback equipment for 5 weeks<br/>$550 - Full 5 day Gallery build-out, labor + materials. Gallery imagery, building of entire black-box theater in back of gallery, stage curtains, etc.<br/>$75 - Promotional materials - gallery signage, flyers, postcards<br/>$475 - Labor to run gallery every Friday, Saturday and Sunday from August 2nd - September 1st, 5 weeks total<br/>$200 - $300 - Indiegogo percentage fee</p>

<p><strong>THE IMPACT - Why a Free Video Art Installation?</strong><br/><br/>Art is not an ornament. It’s a language. It can create a space to share and transcend boundaries. Art creates our community and expands our world as we explore perceptions, emotions, fantasy, and feelings.The arts create connections and open up dialogues that we may begin but not finish ourselves. To participate in the arts is to build space for communities to grow.</p>
<p>I believe art created from a pure place of connection and conviction, and not driven by commercial needs, has the power to touch people at a very deep level. I've already witnessed this at the ground level during the installation's first week open to the public, watching people emerge from the AMATOR MONTUM installation with tears streaming down their face. <br/><br/>If the Spirit moves you to contribute in some way to the continuation of projects of this nature, we'd be most thankful for your contribution and energy!</p>

<p>-To develop our own styles from the inspiration we find in the world around us</p>
<p>-To chronicle our lives as traveling artists into a book filled with our trip’s best artwork and stories</p>

<p>We will begin our journey in Oslo, Norway and then spend two months traveling down Europe, passing through some major art capitals, such as Berlin and Paris. After reaching the Strait of Gibraltar, we will head through Morocco and the Sahara to Italy. From there we will head to Istanbul, ending the first part of our journey. </p>
<p>For the following two months we will be traveling through Asia, flying from Turkey to Aomori, Japan. We will travel down to Shanghai and then Hong Kong. From there we will journey to Ho Chi Minh City, and then Bangkok. We will head up to the Himalayas then travel all the way down to Southern India passing through New Delhi.</p>
<p>During the last two months we will fly from India to Rio De Janeiro where we will travel down to Buenos Aires, over to Santiago, and then up to Bogota. After that we will travel up Central America to Antonio's home in Mexico.</p>
<p><i>""A good traveler has no fixed plan and is never intent on arriving."" - Lao Tzu</i></p>
<p>Our plan is to follow this route and see where it takes us.</p>
<p>We have little idea about the kind of art we will encounter or who we will meet. While we have certain places we want to visit, our route is always subject to change. We do know however, that our journey will span roughly 60 days each in Europe, Asia, and South America. There, we will seek out local galleries, artists communes, visually interesting cities, and beautiful landscapes.</p>
<p>We want to stay as true to the vagabond lifestyle as we can, so your money will only go to the necessities: brushes, canvas, and publishing. </p>
<p>More specifically, publishing a high quality art book can be as much as $8,000, and the remaining $4,000 will be split between the three of us to give us each roughly $1,300 to buy supplies to last us six months. We'll spend that money over the entirety of the trip to restock on paints, brushes, canvas, and paper.</p>
<p>Through the rewards you can purchase our artwork, plan where we will go, and buy the book we will make along the way. Unfortunately, if we don't reach our goal we can only create an e-book of our work. But, the higher the reward the bigger the painting! </p>
<p>In the end, we hope to have seen some of the world’s most unique and unknown art and put it all into a story. We want to share our adventure and how our styles have progressed along the way. The book will be a documentation of our progress as artists. We're going to put our best pieces and stories into a journal entry-type book that shows the influence certain styles had on our art. We each hope to have developed our own styles by the end of the trip and to share them with everyone.</p>
<p>Our passion is what drives us. Follow our journey around the Earth as we create.</p>

We do know however, that our journey will span roughly 60 days each in Europe, Asia, and South America. There, we will seek out local galleries, artists communes, visually interesting cities, and beautiful landscapes.
We want to stay as true to the vagabond lifestyle as we can, so your money will only go to the necessities: brushes, canvas, and publishing. 
More specifically, publishing a high quality art book can be as much as $8,000, and the remaining $4,000 will be split between the three of us to give us each roughly $1,300 to buy supplies to last us six months. We'll spend that money over the entirety of the trip to restock on paints, brushes, canvas, and paper.
Through the rewards you can purchase our artwork, plan where we will go, and buy the book we will make along the way. Unfortunately, if we don't reach our goal we can only create an e-book of our work. But, the higher the reward the bigger the painting! 
In the end, we hope to have seen some of the world’s most unique and unknown art and put it all into a story. We want to share our adventure and how our styles have progressed along the way. The book will be a documentation of our progress as artists. We're going to put our best pieces and stories into a journal entry-type book that shows the influence certain styles had on our art. We each hope to have developed our own styles by the end of the trip and to share them with everyone.
Our passion is what drives us. Follow our journey around the Earth as we create.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

I have been working on grief, loss and reparation after the

re-enact a lost past as I embody both of my parents in their family home, as
well as using projections to evoke a sense of haunting.

<h3>OUR CAMPAIGN</h3>
<p>ArtGuideEast is a <strong>not-for-profit</strong> initiative started in 2011 as a gallery guide of the Central and Eastern European region. Our aim is to help the contemporary art scene of the region to get more visibility internationally.

<p>We work with <strong>volunteers</strong>, some of them are students, some are already established journalists or art professionals - <strong>they all do their work in-kind</strong>. </p>
<p>To get to a more professional level we would need more funding to pay our contributors, printing company - and reach more audiences.</p>
<p><strong>ArtGuideEast is FREE to take for visitors and we would like to keep it that way.</strong></p>
<p>We need your help to make sure quality contemporary art from the Central and Eastern European region can be seen everywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>For 2013 <strong>we would need 2800 EUR</strong> to pay our journalists and to get to the events we write about. It is that simple.</p>

<p>We are Cali and Emily, co-creators of Slam Up, a creative music project that is ""not exactly a comedy music set, not exactly a poetry slam, not exactly a lesbian folk duo- <em>Slam Up</em> is something all to itself."" We are creating a new genre, one that's does not fit into musical labels, but rather takes our listeners on an emotional journey through the many the many stages of life and shades of love-- requited, unrequited, gay,
 straight, queer, or, well, just ""creative."" </p>
<p>Emily and I have been slamming up for a a little over a year now.  By the end of 2014  we will been on the road for five months, sharing our music, stories, and laughter with new and old friends.

All have contributed to making us better performers. We have participated in 2014 The New York City Fringe Festival, and even took a little break from working at our non-creative jobs to attend our first music festival ever, Love Fest in the Midwest. We even found time to record our self-funded debut album, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/slamup-1/sets/same-brain"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Same Brain</a>!<br/><br/>Now that we have spent a year doing our musical DIY ""post-bac"" we are ready to GO TO COLLEGE! But actually. We want to take Slam Up to the next level and start performing for college students across the country. After all, college students are our target demographic, and in order to sustain Slam Up for years to come, it needs to  go back to school.  <br/></p>
<p>In order to bring our emotional roller coaster of a show to colleges nationwide we need to register with the National Association for Campus Engagement (NACA), and then attend the their national convention in Minneapolis this winter.

</h3>My name is Sara Uhlig and I am currently a Master of Arts in Arts Administration graduate thesis candidate at the Savannah College of Art and Design. For my final thesis project I am single-handedly fundraising, marketing, curating, and installing an exhibition entitled <i>The Light Inside the Bell Jar.</i> <br/><br/>Using ""troubled women"" artists as my guide, such as Sylvia Plath and Zelda Fitzgerald, I have been combining my arts administration skills gathered at SCAD to host a group of female-identified artists and their pieces, all artwork that identifies various themes of mental illness in women. <b>The show will take place May 7th through 10th at Sulfur Studios in Savannah, Georgia</b>.<br/><br/>Through this campaign I hope to gain enough funding to cover the various monetary necessities curating an exhibition requires, in order to best showcase the amazing talent I have gathered from throughout the United States and to open up a free dialogue about mental illness in women, and the various women in your life that may be struggling from a mental illness. My personal experience with anxiety and depression will guide me throughout this journey and create a connection with these women artists.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What the exhibition needs &amp; Your fun perks!</h3>
<p>To successfully fund my entire project, I need various amounts of funding. <b>A needed total of $1,200</b>, my budget can be broken down in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>$500 will cover the entire gallery space rental fee<br/>
</li>
<li>$400 will pay for the entirety of my marketing budget, including designing and printing exhibition cards, posters, limited edition screen prints, and exhibition tri-fold brochures</li>
<li>$100 will assist with show costs, such as printing a vinyl exhibition wall decal and purchasing donation boxes for the show<br/>
</li>
<li>$100 covers catering for the May 8th reception</li>
<li>$50 will pay for a photographer to document the May 8th reception, documenting the journey<br/>
</li>
<li>$50 will cover paying for all hanging and installation materials</li>
</ul>
<p><b>For donating to my project you will receive the following perks:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>$1 donation - My undying love &amp; a thank you email!</li>
<li>$5 donation - All $1 perks, plus a handwritten thank you note</li>
<li>$10 donation - All $5 perks, plus a signed mailed exhibition poster<br/>
</li>
<li>$50 donation - All $10 perks, plus a limited edition, handmade screen print poster for the exhibition<br/>
</li>
<li>$100 donation - All $50 perks, plus a private tour of the exhibition with the curator (Only 4 available)<br/>
</li>
<li>$500 donation - All $100 perks, plus a private dinner with the curator and local Savannah artists, at the local Savannah restaurant of your chosing (Only 1 available) </li>
</ul>
<p>If I do not reach my goal I intend to use most of the funding to cover the studio rental fee as well as assisting out-of-state artists in covering the shipping costs of mailing their artwork to Savannah.<br/><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact on Women &amp; Families touched by mental illness<br/>
</h3>
<p><b>The exhibition is also a philanthropic endeavor</b>, with a hopeful <b>minimum of a $200 to The Kim Foundation</b>, a group focused on increasing awareness and promoting continued education related to 
	mental illness. The foundation strives to break down the stigma often 
	associated with seeking mental health care and works to 
	assure individuals and families touched by mental illness that they are not 
	alone on their journey to recovery. Learn more about them at <a href=""http://www.thekimfoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thekimfoundation.org/</a></p>

</div></div>","So what's this all about?
My name is Sara Uhlig and I am currently a Master of Arts in Arts Administration graduate thesis candidate at the Savannah College of Art and Design. For my final thesis project I am single-handedly fundraising, marketing, curating, and installing an exhibition entitled The Light Inside the Bell Jar. Using ""troubled women"" artists as my guide, such as Sylvia Plath and Zelda Fitzgerald, I have been combining my arts administration skills gathered at SCAD to host a group of female-identified artists and their pieces, all artwork that identifies various themes of mental illness in women. The show will take place May 7th through 10th at Sulfur Studios in Savannah, Georgia.Through this campaign I hope to gain enough funding to cover the various monetary necessities curating an exhibition requires, in order to best showcase the amazing talent I have gathered from throughout the United States and to open up a free dialogue about mental illness in women, and the various women in your life that may be struggling from a mental illness. My personal experience with anxiety and depression will guide me throughout this journey and create a connection with these women artists.
  What the exhibition needs & Your fun perks!
To successfully fund my entire project, I need various amounts of funding. A needed total of $1,200, my budget can be broken down in the following ways:

$500 will cover the entire gallery space rental fee

$400 will pay for the entirety of my marketing budget, including designing and printing exhibition cards, posters, limited edition screen prints, and exhibition tri-fold brochures
$100 will assist with show costs, such as printing a vinyl exhibition wall decal and purchasing donation boxes for the show

$100 covers catering for the May 8th reception
$50 will pay for a photographer to document the May 8th reception, documenting the journey

$50 will cover paying for all hanging and installation materials

For donating to my project you will receive the following perks:

$1 donation - My undying love & a thank you email!
$5 donation - All $1 perks, plus a handwritten thank you note
$10 donation - All $5 perks, plus a signed mailed exhibition poster

$50 donation - All $10 perks, plus a limited edition, handmade screen print poster for the exhibition

$100 donation - All $50 perks, plus a private tour of the exhibition with the curator (Only 4 available)

$500 donation - All $100 perks, plus a private dinner with the curator and local Savannah artists, at the local Savannah restaurant of your chosing (Only 1 available) 

If I do not reach my goal I intend to use most of the funding to cover the studio rental fee as well as assisting out-of-state artists in covering the shipping costs of mailing their artwork to Savannah.
    The Impact on Women & Families touched by mental illness

The exhibition is also a philanthropic endeavor, with a hopeful minimum of a $200 to The Kim Foundation, a group focused on increasing awareness and promoting continued education related to 
	mental illness. The foundation strives to break down the stigma often 
	associated with seeking mental health care and works to 
	assure individuals and families touched by mental illness that they are not 
	alone on their journey to recovery. Learn more about them at http://www.thekimfoundation.org/

<h3>A Short Summary of my project:</h3>
<p>Thanks so much for thinking about funding my language exchange. I'll tell you a little more about myself, and why I think you should contribute:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm 15 years old, a sophomore in high school.</li>
<li>I have been studying Korean for over a year by myself, and am taking French classes at school. I am interested in becoming fluent in multiple languages, and I want to travel and meet people all around the world.</li>
<li>I have been drawing since I was a little girl, and I have entered contests with my drawings as well. I have taken art lessons in the past, and I love making art. I think art is very important: it can be inspiration to act, encouragement, pure feeling. Art is necessary.</li>
<li>This language exchange could be a turning point in my life: something that helps me form new relationships with people, become a better global citizen, and have a broader world view, not to mention learning to speak Korean much more fluently.</li>
<li>This language exchange doesn't only affect me: by influencing the way I interact with people, it could have a broader effect on the people I meet in the future. I will meet people from a very different place, and could influence their outlook on life and the world as well.</li>
<li>By funding my campaign, you would be supporting a budding language learner and artist and influencing the future.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My parents have generously agreed to pay for half of the funds of my trip, but I still need to earn $1,500 on my own. This would go to expenses like airplane tickets, food, and travel within the country. If I don't earn the money through this campaign, I will need to find another way to earn it somehow, or I won't be able to go.</p>
<p>The good thing is, there's something in it for you, too, contributors! From a simple thank-you shout out to a commission or print of a drawing or short comic, I have plenty of rewards in mind for a range of donation amounts. I have specific ideas for the rewards already, but I'm very willing to work with you if you have a certain idea for a project in mind that's not listed! I may not be able to do everything you suggest, but I'd love to communicate with you.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal, the funds will still go to my trip, and I'll earn the rest in another way.</p>
</div><div>

<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
<li>If you're really dedicated, you could probably hand out flyers or something. I'd be into it.</li>

<p>We are an independent horror culture magazine.  We've recently finished our 3rd issue and have been distributing through word of mouth and online sales (we come out of pocket, and have our issues printed) and we are ever growing.  Our mag is an ever evolving mix of horror art, photography, musicians, models, tattoos and tattoo artists, crafters, special effects artists, horror celebs, and whatever else fits into the horror culture theme.  Imagine a punk rock magazine and Fangoria having a baby and then the baby went on a booze fueled killing spree, now that's our magazine.  We are very much about staying independent and that's why we need your help to keep it that way.  It's not cheap printing magazines!<br/></p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We hope to be the magazine that everyone turns to when they need some inspiration.  The artists we feature are second to none.  Our mission is to provide a voice for all the amazing artists that would never get covered because they are too ""dark"", too tattooed, too out of the ordinary, or not ""big"" enough.  We'd also like to bloody up a few celebs for your enjoyment.. <br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money you donate will go towards printing enough magazines to get distribution.  We have a distributor standing by waiting for us to print enough copies to plaster Gore Noir all over the states.  If we make enough money will are also looking at producing an Iphone, Ipad, and Android App.  The app will allow us to be viewed instantly all over the globe.  Horror knows no bias, it's loved by all cultures.  We have options for people who want to be in our magazine, people who want to own some of our magazines, and people who would like to sell our magazines.  Shirts, mags, stickers, your face in an issue, a party wherever you want.. Lots of options for everyone!<br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We realize people are low on funds but every donation counts.  Instead of buying that Tall Latte you could be helping us realize our dreams of producing a magazine that is read worldwide.  If you'd still rather buy that latte that's fine, but maybe you could share our page instead?  Someone in your online networks could LOVE our cause and be the difference between us failing or not.  Sharing is Caring!  Even if we don't hit our goal we still get the funding so that we can at least print a larger amount then we are currently able to afford.. or maybe even pay someone to produce that App so we can at least reach our digital market!</p>

<p>My greatest accomplishment for me is really when people who have purchased my art, say how happy it makes them feel, how that particular piece lifts their spirits and vibrates good energy! Also that they love all the color :o)</p>
<p>I have begun to make prints of my work, and to date I have been paying someone else to take high quality photos of my work for me. This is expensive and therefore I have not been able to take these kinds of photos of every painting. This is why I need a good camera. I have researched for something that will do the trick and is not too expensive. The Nikon D3000 which is 10.2 megapixels will work perfectly and is around $550.</p>
<p>The rest of the funds will be allocated to continuing to grow my business and be able to create more prints, giclees, a wider selection of greeting cards, to purchase additional paints, canvases and art supplies.</p>
<p>It is very important to me that my art connect with people – and I put my heart and soul into every painting (hence the name Soul Energy Expressions). I’ve been inspired by so many beautiful things in my life and my art/paintings are my way of contributing, not just figuratively, but literally.</p>
<p>I have already set up an online monthly charity event on Facebook where 3 paintings of mine are featured, 20% of each sale going to that month’s particular charity with the focus being on people,  animals, and environment.</p>
<p>This months (June/July) focus is on people. The more I build my business, the more I can contribute.

<p>Perks involve receiving a selection of my greeting cards, a signed high quality print, an original 18 × 18 painting and of course many a “Thank you” from my heart!</p>
<p>Another very important event for me coming up very soon (August!) is becoming a mother! A single mother, so lots of work to do! So, it is even more important that I have as many essentials for my business set up by then.</p>

strong and gives them the power to believe in this big journey across the sea. They
worked hard all year and raised funds to cover all the costs, apart from the travel. We were ready to

Hanno lavorato duramente tutto l'anno e raccolto fondi per coprire tutti i costi, a parte il viaggio. Eravamo pronti ad aiutarli, e abbiamo accettato di coprire i costi del trasporto dalla Svizzera al porto di Travenmünden e, tornando indietro, dal porto di Helsinki a San Pietroburgo su strada. Andata e ritorno. Per il traghetto abbiamo fatto domanda per il finanziamento svizzero, e confermato la prenotazione. L'enorme costo del viaggio sarebbe dovuto essere pagato dal finanziamento di una fondazione e dal governo svizzero, ma all'ultimo minuto, la scorsa settimana, entrambi ci hanno dato una risposta negativa. Quindi sta a noi ora trovare anche i soldi per il traghetto da Travenmünde a Helsinki. Noi non li abbiamo! La compagnia di traghetti Finnlines, ha fatto un passo straordinario, è intervenuta e ha sponsorizzato la metà del prezzo del biglietto. A loro va il nostro profondo grazie di cuore. Per l'altra metà, non sappiamo come fare, ma siamo sicuri che possiamo far accadere questo miracolo con il vostro aiuto! Abbiamo ancora bisogno di raccogliere 5200 €. Amiamo enormemente il potere della narrazione, il teatro, e raggiungere il bambino che vive in ognuno di noi. Ci siamo dedicati con passione a raggiungere il più alto livello di abilità possibile. Oltre a visitare le città, e i villaggi, ci siamo impegnati a raggiungere il pubblico in zone rurali dove è molto difficile accedere regolarmente al teatro. Viviamo nei nostri carri di legno tutto l'anno, e in tour per otto mesi l'anno, e cerchiamo di andare ovunque siamo invitati. Noi lavoriamo con le persone e le organizzazioni che condividono i nostri valori e la nostra fede appassionata nel teatro, nelle storie, e nel nostro pubblico. Grazie se riuscirete ad aiutarci, anche con poco.x n&m",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Hello! I'm Jo and I am a Scenic Artist, currently studying at RCS in Glasgow.</strong> <strong>I have a work placement in literally one of the most amazing Scenic studios early next year in upstate New York. I am sooo excited to be going and literally can't wait to get out there and be painting in my favourite place. It's my dream to be a Scenic Artist, and a dream to get a placement out in New York, and I am working my butt off to make sure that happens!</strong></p>
<p>I have been doing Illustration commissions for you guys for a while now (sincerest thanks to anyone who has ever bought one of my pieces!). My idea is this: I will open up my commission books and paint as many illustrations as I can before I go. If you have ever wanted an illustration from me and were not sure of what to ask for, or who to get one for, or anything - now is the time! Christmas is coming up, an illustration would be ideal as a personalised gift and you can have literally anything you want - you know I love my pop culture references - the crazier and more obscure the better! Or if you want to have a family moment captured, or a cute pet portrait - anything goes and I am happy to oblige.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>I am trying to raise £500 to help go towards my expenses for this trip. </strong>This will help go towards my Air bnb, my food, my flight home etc. And I want to use the skills I have to be able to help pay for this. </p>
<p>Illustration Commissions will cost £35.00, and as I mentioned before, they can be of any subject of your choosing. The illustrations will be A4 in size and on watercolour paper, and will come delivered to you packaged in an A4 postage box ( Postage applies and UK delivery only - for worldwide commissions please just message!) :) </p>
<p>I am running this campaign all the way up until I leave for New York so I will have plenty time to paint as many as I can, however if you would like something specifically as a gift for Christmas, please just let me know so I can accommodate my time. These will be delivered to you via Royal Mail in an A4 postage box (UK only). I will send these out to you throughout December/January as soon as they are ready however if you have a specific date in mind (Christmas/birthday etc) let me know and I will accommodate!</p>
<p>I am just trying to earn some extra money to help go towards this, please understand that I am also working my butt off with several other jobs to help make this happen too! I sincerely appreciate any help so even if you don't want a commission, a wee share of my goal on your social media is also so much appreciated :) </p>

The leaves are cast Kudzu paper, imprinted with various definitions of fear gathered from surveys.</p>
<p>The Installation will be exhibited in the OGLETHORPE GALLERY in Savannah, GA May 10-12 2012. There will be three nights of exhibition and a different performing art student will be trapped in my Kudzu adornment each night. I have also hired a sound design student to create an original score that consists of a creepy melody with sound bytes from the creative process (i.e. paper blender, torch fire, steel forging, etc) then at the end of the 15 minute song there will be an interlude of overlapping voices talking about Fear. During the music the performing art student is meant to be frozen and almost unseen, then when the voices being the actress will come alive and desperately ask the audience for help.</p>
<p>I have spent over 300 hours making my hand made leaves out of leaves from the actual Kudzu plant that I harvested and then ground up into a paper pulp. The pulp is then pressed in to copper plates that have words etched on them to emboss the paper. Then I use towels to roll out the moisture. Once the pulp is pressed and dried I hand cut the paper into leaf forms and burn them with a torch to make the words stand out. At the moment I have roughly 3316 leaves!</p>
<p>The body adornment pieces are all sculpted by hand out of various gauges of copper wire. Once sculpted the pieces are sand blasted and treated with a chemical patina to make the copper turn a ghostly green shade. </p>
<p>The base of the structure is a chair that a sculpture student helped me weld out of steel and painted to mimic the copper green patina. the seat of the chair I have woven out of Kudzu vines. </p>
<p>This body installation is the grandest project I have ever attempted, it is the embodiment of who I am as an artist and as a human being. I consider it an ideal marriage of metal work, sculpture, concept, and performance art. Your support with help me cover the costs of copper wire, my exhibition space, compensation for the student artists that have assisted me, and the various other elements that will bring this installation to life!

Around 1908, he was taken back to his mother’s homeland, Altofonte, Sicily, and stayed there until he was 18. Because his mother insisted that he keep his American citizenship, he received no Italian schooling other than what he learned on the dusty Sicilian streets. Around 1924, during the beginnings of Italian Fascist rule in Italy, he traveled back to upstate New York in the middle of winter without coat on his back. He escaped the direction of his country and the lack of opportunity for himself. He came to the US and rarely looked back to Sicily for sustenance or guidance – even discouraging his sons to speak the language. His story is not dissimilar to so many immigrants from so many countries – ambitious individuals escaping lack of opportunity or worse and aspiring for something better.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p>Fast-forward to year 2000, I marry a Sicilian, also in the US for ambitious reasons. However, instead of running away from Sicily, we make a decision to maintain our connection, dependency, and stewardship of our Sicilian family and olive yard. This translates into a month-long trip every summer with our children into the arms of our nonni, cugini, and amici in Agrigento. For 13 years I have written, photographed, and mulled over my relationship to Sicily, my children, and the complicated clash between tradition and contemporary reality.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/360654/files/20140210081315-DSC_2391.jpg?1392048795"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As an artist and teacher, I have long been interested in the psychology and biology of community, learning, and labor. I have wanted to make visible the contributions of the lesser celebrated – the mothers, the house-keepers, the farmers, the peddlers, the students, the artists. Currently, Sicily is in economic shambles with 38.8 percent of young people without jobs, twice the national average. Corruption, despondency, and depression is high and locals feel invisible in the global theater. Our grandfathers’ flights continue to have relevancy. Yet, you have never had a peach unless you’ve tasted one from Sicily. The food, the family loyalty, the intense commitment to survival and beauty – I affirm that these assets are to be preserved in a climate of change, globalism, and capitalist bullying. </span></p><p>During these many summers, I have prepared myself and my supporters in the small town of Favara, Sicily, to embark on a project, entitled ""Regali"", that will bring many of these interests together while also providing opportunities for several participants, both Italian and American, to bridge our cultural divide and celebrate the individual stories of the citizens of Favara. <b><b>Over the course of 2 weeks, 5 American artists and 5 Italian artists will form teams and interview 30 families in the rural Sicilian town of Favara that have a story to tell about a special gift in their lives.

renewal project that has transformed the run-down and semi-abandoned heart of
Favara into a modern art exhibition and community space. Artists, tourists and
locals have come from far and wide and the Farm’s efforts have begun to
revitalize Favara. The Farm has several gallery spaces, a bookshop, apartments, and an
open mind. They have offered exhibition space, lodging for the visiting
artists, as well as logistics and installation support. This collaboration
would be the first of its kind with the United States. <span><br/></span><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><span><br/></span>We have invited 4 young emerging American artists to participate

It will contribute to the resolve of the Sicilian people to survive in an extremely depressed area during severe recession and continuous corruption. The Farm Cultural Park has already begun to contribute to the livability of Sicily and its revitalization. New hotels and restaurants have emerged and the local medieval castle has been renovated in its wake. This project will further these efforts as well as share the gifts of the Sicilian people with those of us who are supposedly better off. My goal is to trigger conversations about defining the quality of life, the assets of an ancient culture, and how we determine the “best practices” of old and new.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need</h3><p></p><ul>

For him each painting, figurine, sterling silver money clip, or vintage car, is a story, a memory, a way of proving the relevancy of his nationality and connection to tradition. Though his generosity with us is extreme and unconditional, we live an ocean and a sea away and these objects inevitably stay with Nonno. Each time his son leaves “home” and returns to the US with his American wife, I feel we chip away at the importance of these objects. Sicilian culture is often sited for its hospitality and warmth. It is true. In Sicily, gift giving is an obsession, a cultural norm and highly refined system. The research of Paul Zak and others has shown that the act of giving has also been linked to the release of oxytocin, a hormone that induces feelings of warmth, euphoria, trust, and connection to others: more generosity, more empathy, stronger community. Giving changes us at a molecular level.</span></p><p></p><h3>Why Support Us?</h3><p></p><p></p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/361052/files/20140210105900-Screen_Shot_2012-11-21_at_11.41.37_AM.png?1392058740"" src="""" style=""width: 94.24752475247524px; height: 114px;""/>  <b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Nita Sturiale, Project Director</b></p><p></p><p></p><p>I am defined by my passion as a mother and teacher.

<p></p></div>","Help me build a bridge!My name is Nita Sturiale and my past and present is intertwined
with Sicily.
I have been a Professor at the Massachusetts College of Art and
Design in Boston for more than 15 years, am currently the department chair, and
have been the project manager for many successful endeavors in the
arts and in business.
I have been traveling to Sicily every summer for 14 years with
my Sicilian husband and children. I have reconnected with my own Sicilian
heritage, visited the towns of my grandparents, and been embraced by my
husband’s family and friends. I’ve made my own personal artwork during these
summer months, but for years, I have wanted to share the sights, sounds,
tastes, and incredible Sicilian generosity with my students and artist friends.
“Regali Artist Residency in Sicily” is the culmination of that desire.
Over the course of 2 weeks in July, 5 American artists and 5
Italian artists will collaborate and interview several families in the rural
Sicilian town of Favara. These families will tell us their stories about a
special gift in their lives. These stories and gifts will be
collected and displayed in a multi-media exhibition at a gallery in Favara. We will also design a catalog of the project. 
We invite you to become a part of Regali and share the joy of
gifting, story telling, and all things Sicilian!“Our gifts, if we hold onto them, are worthless until they are shared.” Reverend Peter BoullataNita handing out gifts to Sicilian women as part of her Pietre Preziose project of 2008This project, Regali, is symbol of gratitude to my grandfather for his Sicilian heritage, as well as his bravery to seek a better life for himself and his children in America. It is an apology to my father-in-law for taking his son far away. It is a promise to my daughters that they will have the power to invent a future for themselves that is the best of both worlds.Regali: 
Nita’s personal motivation
My grandfather was born in upstate New York in 1906. Around 1908, he was taken back to his mother’s homeland, Altofonte, Sicily, and stayed there until he was 18. Because his mother insisted that he keep his American citizenship, he received no Italian schooling other than what he learned on the dusty Sicilian streets. Around 1924, during the beginnings of Italian Fascist rule in Italy, he traveled back to upstate New York in the middle of winter without coat on his back. He escaped the direction of his country and the lack of opportunity for himself. He came to the US and rarely looked back to Sicily for sustenance or guidance – even discouraging his sons to speak the language. His story is not dissimilar to so many immigrants from so many countries – ambitious individuals escaping lack of opportunity or worse and aspiring for something better.Fast-forward to year 2000, I marry a Sicilian, also in the US for ambitious reasons. However, instead of running away from Sicily, we make a decision to maintain our connection, dependency, and stewardship of our Sicilian family and olive yard. This translates into a month-long trip every summer with our children into the arms of our nonni, cugini, and amici in Agrigento. For 13 years I have written, photographed, and mulled over my relationship to Sicily, my children, and the complicated clash between tradition and contemporary reality.As an artist and teacher, I have long been interested in the psychology and biology of community, learning, and labor. I have wanted to make visible the contributions of the lesser celebrated – the mothers, the house-keepers, the farmers, the peddlers, the students, the artists. Currently, Sicily is in economic shambles with 38.8 percent of young people without jobs, twice the national average. Corruption, despondency, and depression is high and locals feel invisible in the global theater. Our grandfathers’ flights continue to have relevancy. Yet, you have never had a peach unless you’ve tasted one from Sicily. The food, the family loyalty, the intense commitment to survival and beauty – I affirm that these assets are to be preserved in a climate of change, globalism, and capitalist bullying. During these many summers, I have prepared myself and my supporters in the small town of Favara, Sicily, to embark on a project, entitled ""Regali"", that will bring many of these interests together while also providing opportunities for several participants, both Italian and American, to bridge our cultural divide and celebrate the individual stories of the citizens of Favara. Over the course of 2 weeks, 5 American artists and 5 Italian artists will form teams and interview 30 families in the rural Sicilian town of Favara that have a story to tell about a special gift in their lives. These stories and gifts will be collected into an exhibition at a gallery in Favara.
We are collaborating with Farm Cultural Park,
a new contemporary arts center in the midst of Favara, founded by Andrea Bartoli
in 2010.The Farm is an ambitious and exciting urban
renewal project that has transformed the run-down and semi-abandoned heart of
Favara into a modern art exhibition and community space. Artists, tourists and
locals have come from far and wide and the Farm’s efforts have begun to
revitalize Favara. The Farm has several gallery spaces, a bookshop, apartments, and an
open mind. They have offered exhibition space, lodging for the visiting
artists, as well as logistics and installation support. This collaboration
would be the first of its kind with the United States. We have invited 4 young emerging American artists to participate
in Regali. We will be sharing their stories periodically throughout the
campaign. We are also working closely with Lisa Wade, an International artist
living in Italy that will be managing logistics in Favara.  You can read more about the participating artists on our Regali blog.""Regali"" intertwines the fields of fine art, story telling, social practice, education, and community development. It will contribute to the resolve of the Sicilian people to survive in an extremely depressed area during severe recession and continuous corruption. The Farm Cultural Park has already begun to contribute to the livability of Sicily and its revitalization. New hotels and restaurants have emerged and the local medieval castle has been renovated in its wake. This project will further these efforts as well as share the gifts of the Sicilian people with those of us who are supposedly better off. My goal is to trigger conversations about defining the quality of life, the assets of an ancient culture, and how we determine the “best practices” of old and new.What We Need

We need to buy 5 American artists round-trip airfare from the US to Sicily from July 14 - July 27.  

All the artists will to need to eat while we are working!

As many locals in Favara speak Italian and Sicilian, we need translation services. 


We need to offset the costs of our Italian collaborator, Lisa Wade, who will be doing the lion-share of the Sicilian preparatory work before we arrive. 


We will need to pay for printing materials for the photo documentation to be included in gallery exhibition. 





Ideal Project Budget:





Airfare for American artists
  $5,000
$1000 towards ticket price x 5 artists


Per diem for all artists
  $4,200
10 artists x $30 a
  day x 14 days


Framing/exhibiton/printing supplies
  $2,000


Translation services
  $2,600
2 translators x 10 days x $160/day


Logistics

for prep before we arrive and during the residency organizing italian artists and gallery. 


Total - 
$15,800

This is the first year of the this project. I plan to return the following summer for part 2. A Bit More About What led to ""Regali""During our annual summer trip to Sicily, I am struck by the treasure-trove of objects in my father-in-law’s house that represent several lifetimes of acquisition. For him each painting, figurine, sterling silver money clip, or vintage car, is a story, a memory, a way of proving the relevancy of his nationality and connection to tradition. Though his generosity with us is extreme and unconditional, we live an ocean and a sea away and these objects inevitably stay with Nonno. Each time his son leaves “home” and returns to the US with his American wife, I feel we chip away at the importance of these objects. Sicilian culture is often sited for its hospitality and warmth. It is true. In Sicily, gift giving is an obsession, a cultural norm and highly refined system.

We support aspiring, novice, beginner, intermediate, advanced, or professional artists, and encourage every level to participate and develop the inner artist found in all of us.What We Need & What You GetCreate has been in constant operation for over 20 years. Because we live in a depressed area, raising local money to fund our operation has become a challenge. We own our building and property, but operating costs and programs exceed our ability to keep it constantly funded.  It is our goal to provide a facility to encourage our adults and our youth to participate in the arts and learn to express themselves through art.  
For every $100 dollars donated, we will mail the donor a ""fused glass"" Christmas Ornament.
For every $200 dollars donated, we will send you five 2013 Capitol Christmas Tree Cards with a photo of the tree before it was cut. (It grew in our area.) In addition, we will send one Capitol Christmas Tree Commemorative Ornament.
If we don't reach our entire goal, any funds that are donated will help to keep Create alive and functioning.  Every little bit helps!The ImpactAn example of Create's impact on our local community is our recent moccasin class.  24 people attended the class, including a father with a developmentally delayed teenage son, a grandmother with two grandchildren, a mother with four teenage girls, a set of parents with  two teenage boys. Attendees learned how to create their own moccasins from leather.  The experience was so positive that the local elementary school asked us to repeat the class for 75 third graders.Because the cost of leather would have been cost prohibitive, we used upholstery material.  One third grade boy had never seen a needle before this class, let alone having ever sewn anything.  Because it was National American Indian History month, the Kalispel Tribe of  Indians put on an assembly for the children where the children listened to drumming and learned to dance and show off their moccasins.  The children learned about local history, along with learning a skill. Other Ways You Can HelpWe recognize that not everyone can donate.  But everyone can help pass the word.  Please let others know about our needs.  Talk to your firiends and relatives.  We will appreciate it.  And dont forget to use Indiegogo share tools.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","The New Lines Alleyway Mural Project In the summer of 2016, two of Cincinnati's biggest nonprofit names in community revitalization and public art (Keep Cincinnati Beautiful and ArtWorks) are partnering to take their work to Over-the-Rhine's alleyways!
During the months of June-August, 12 new murals will be painted in OTR's Main St. district alleys, which are some of our city's most neglected pedestrian spaces. Led by local Teaching Artists, aided by Apprentices, these murals are designed by artists with local ties.

a slow, deliberate, and often solitary practice that lends itself to a magical
quality.  In order to create with cut paper, the artist must first
destroy, an alchemical process, speaking to the divine dichotomy of creation

artists will be in San Francisco engaged in an open art studio at the deYoung’s
Kimball Gallery. During these two-months they will be cutting and creating new
provocative bodies of work for exhibition at the historic Galeria de la Raza in
the cultural and mural rich San Francisco’s Mission District. Starting from
four locations in the Galeria the artist’s work will weave towards a central
architectural collaboration involving layers of their cut paper works blending
together a new narrative. . 
WHAT
IS CUT PAPER?  Cut paper is the medium that brings these four artists together, and
while each artist has developed their own personalized techniques to obtain
their unique styles and aesthetics, the fundamental materials are the same.
Meditative in nature, the cutting of paper is
a slow, deliberate, and often solitary practice that lends itself to a magical
quality.  In order to create with cut paper, the artist must first
destroy, an alchemical process, speaking to the divine dichotomy of creation
and destruction. 
Why is Paper & Blade: Storytelling Under the Knife worth supporting?""Paper & Blade"" will be a powerful vehicle for communication that cuts across racial, cultural, social, educational and economic barriers and enhances cultural appreciation and awareness. It will be an artistic exploration resulting in visual storytelling, creating a platform for inter-connectivity between the audience and artists. How Will Your Support Help Us?
Your generous
donation weather big or small will help us reach our fundraising goal - to
cover 50% of our travel and lodging cost for two of the artists coming from the
East Coast and also help expense the exhibition framing cost. All donations
are tax-deductible and will be received and managed by Kua`aina Associates,
Inc. (A California based Art & Cultures Non-profit that that is providing
the coordination for the artists). 
Artist Ian
Kuali`i  Meet the Artists
Mayumi Hamanaka is
a Japanese artist who uses
historical photographs and references to examine memory and the mistakes of the
past. She uses a subtle process of cutting topographies into photographs, where
details start to disappear and amorphous white forms develop like oversize
puzzle pieces. Up close they suggest topographical contour maps, but the
contours are layers of paper cutouts secured by tiny metal studs. These layers
speak to the layers of earth that consists of layers of formerly living
things, including humans. http://mayumihamanaka.com/                                                                                             Invisible Lands - 41"" x 58""
Adrienne
Heloise researches historical events as the basis for her work
and translates early European paintings into contemporary explorations of
intimacy, gender and power.   She cuts colored paper, recycled
security envelopes and vinyl to recreate images from the French Romantic era
paintings.  She delves into the isolation and titillation of homosocial
interaction by appropriating the symbols of 19th century western royalty,
weaponry and fashion.  http://www.adrienneheloise.com/                                                                                                     Heartthrob - 10"" x 10""Ian Kuali`i’s creative process is ""The meditative process of destroying
to create"". Blending the contrasting elements of loose graffiti techniques
with detailed hand cut paper to manifest unique compositions. His work is a
balance between the rough and delicate while exploring ideas of modern progress
dependent on a foundation in one’s own history. His art is influenced by his
ancestral ties to the Southwest United States and Hawaii, as well as Masonic
symbolism, mysticism, global politics and themes of urban decay.http://iankualii.com/                                                                                             Newarkave and Fragments
Kai
Margarida-Ramírez de Arellano
was born in Puerto Rico and raised
in New Mexico.  This double sense of home has given her a unique
perspective on post-colonial, feminist and border identity. Specializing in
paper cutting and embroidery, Kai's artwork fuses her family mythology,
pop-culture, and intricate handiwork.  Her most recent paper cuts source
from family stories and photographs taken by her great-great-grandmother,
thereby establishing inter-generational collaborations with her ancestors.
 This process has allowed Kai to collapse time and explore her space as a
woman between cultures, languages, and epochs. http://www.kaicita.com/

<h3><em><strong>The Maneki Neko or ""Beckoning Cat"" is an auspicious good luck symbol originating from Japan during the Edo Period, and is still prevalent today. It is said to bring good luck and prosperity to home, family, friends, and business. A Lucky Cat myself, I've been inspired by their beauty and decided to sketch them one day. I've made many art trading cards in the past so decided to turn my final sketches into just that. But then I didn't draw just one...I kept drawing and made more...And More...AND MORE! Obsession! I designed many many cards, but was sad at the thought of giving them away individually. Nobody would ever see the full series. SADNESS! But then I had another idea...put all the kitties  into a mini book so everyone can enjoy the happinesses of lucky cats! So even those people not lucky enough to be owned by a cat may still find the joys of their elegance in art. Sweetness!</strong></em></h3>
In the legends, the Maneki Neko originally was a Japanese calico bobtail cat...that means a multi-spotted cat with a nub for a tail. Don't laugh! There are several stories about how the legend began but one of the most widely believed versions involves a cat and his monk. The cat was sitting in the doorway of the monk's temple during a terrible storm, and a samurai or nobleman took shelter nearby under a tree. As the story goes, the nobleman saw the cat ""waving"" to him, and so he went to the temple for better shelter, an act that saved his life since lightning struck the tree seconds after! Thankful, he gave the monk much wealth, which the monk in turn gave back to his community. Word traveled about this cat and soon business owners carved cats to put in their shops, and people bought them to put in doorways of their homes...all hoping the lucky cat would bring them prosperity.
<p>Today, the iconic cat is still seen in some shops and homes, often painted gold. They can be holding various symbolic objects like the koban (gold coin), a fish, ingot (boat-shaped gold piece), goard, crystal ball, money mallet, and more. Some come in other colors which also have meanings (although many meanings differ), and some kitties show a right paw raised (good luck and wealth), while others have the left paw raised (inviting company and customers), while others still wave both paws (protecting family and home). Many lucky cats don't have tails, while others do, and many have a collar, bell, and bib. It is considered very feng shui to place a Maneki Neko facing an entrance to your home or business.</p>

<h1>I Can Has Lucky Cat Arts?</h1>
<p>This book compiles all of my current series of Maneki Nekos into one place, totaling currently at 27 images. No one has to miss a cat! HAPPINESS! There's a variety of kitties, with background colors of the rainbow. The book is also sized so you'll be seeing the art at true scale...the size it was created at and originally intended to be (art cards are standardly sized at 2.5X3.5"" like a playing card). Plus, it fits in your pocket and can go anywhere, giving you a smile and good feelings whenever you take a peek in. Also, it's glossy and hairball free, like me! <strong><em>However, please note the book is more an art project than a publishing venture right now, so if you really want a copy pledge now before it eludes you! Don't be a sad kitty! Even if the goal for this project is NOT met, you WILL get the reward you pledged for!<br/></em></strong></p>
<h1>
<strong>BACKER REWARDS!</strong> </h1>
<p><strong>THE POCKET MANEKI NEKO BOOK: </strong>This is what it's all about, my lovelies! A small book just slightly larger than an ATC itself (aprox. 3.75x2.5""), containing all 27 images of the Maneki Neko project. All books will come with an original Maneki Neko sketch on the inside cover, are signed, and numbered!<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>COLORING PAGE: </strong>Everyone that pledges will get a free black and white coloring page for the kittens in their lives to color. This is sent digitally so you can print as many copies as you need for your litter.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>ATCs:</strong> Everyone that pledges deserves a lucky cat! My Maneki Nekos were originally designed as cards, so it makes the most sense that everyone have at least one in its original format. You'll get to choose which card you'd like to have**. Those that get the printed edition ATCs shipped will also get the art signed, soft-sleeved, &amp; sleeved into a durable top-loader suitable for display all on its own. Prints are matte finished.</p>
<p><strong>5X7"" PRINTS:</strong> ATCs with a black &amp; colored border to imitate a mat for very nice framing. You get to pick the ATC** and the color ""mat"" border to best match your home or office. Printed versions also come signed and have a matte finish.</p>
<p><strong>BOOKMARKS:</strong> Bookmarks only come printed. Hopefully they will be on heavy UV glossy bookmark paper - this is in the works, and with a tassle if I can help it. I love batting at tassles! These bookmark prints will be of the design I am drawing up as seen in the video.</p>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL ATCs FROM THE BOOK:</strong> Originals come signed, soft-sleeved, &amp; sleeved into a durable top-loader. Sorry, but choices for these are randomly shipped. However, you can tell me 2-3 favorite colors or images** and I will try my best to get you one of those cards...but no promises my lovelies! But that's not all! I'll also throw in a little black plastic stand so you can display the original card anywhere! Classy! All these kitty cards need good homes. Original art cards come with the most beautiful lucky cat golden envelopes too, yes.</p>

<h3>Who We are</h3>
<p> Longmont Council for the Arts believes art enhances the quality of life. Every day, we inspire creativity for our artists, students and patrons because art e.nables us to see the world in a different way. Since 1985 we have been working to enhance the arts in Longmont for the community and support our artists so they can be artists. As part of the Longmont Arts &amp; Entertainment District, we are working to unify, enhance and promote the arts within downtown.</p>
<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>This project of blank breezeway walls inspired both artists and organizations to make a creative statement of the impact of the arts in Longmont. By bringing together a group of local artists with the Longmont Council for the Arts and the Longmont Downtown Development Authority to brainstorm possible artistic additions to the breezeway and the entire downtown district the concept of an outdoor art gallery emerged. This outdoor gallery will be a mix of the dynamic and enduring, the past and the future.  The top portion of the walls will be its focal point, featuring a permanent mural by Gamma Acosta telling Longmont's Story.  Artist Cynthia Marsh will collaborate with Gamma to create 3-D figures on the lower part of the wall that will draw people in to the Breezeway.</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>Why we need you help</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>We have been offered a matching grant of $5,000 once we raise $5,000.  We are well on our way and need $1,500 to help bring us to that goal.</strong></h3>
<p>It has been very exciting to see this project develop and our great artists who helped design it. The money raised will help pay a portion of the artist stipend to create the mural.</p>
<div>
<h3>Longmont's Story</h3>
<p>The Community -past, present &amp; future - is the inspiration for the mural.  To tell Longmont's Story through the eyes of the artists.

<p>First off, thank you for checking out my Indiegogo! This campaign is all about monsters... don't worry, they are plush and don't bite. I have been designing and creating plush for over 3 years now and love every inch of what I create. My plush are all handmade using crochet with a tiny hook and yarn. All of my plush are unique, not one is like the other. My inspiration comes from street art and the amazing colorful portraits you see on the side of buildings. I simply love color and I love unusual color combinations!</p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to keep my shop going and spread more monster plush love! I am also pursuing to get my patterns into a crochet book, so funding will help to build the supplies to make all the samples needed for this project as well.</p>

<h1>About my plush</h1>

</div></div>","Ahhh! Plush Monsters!
First off, thank you for checking out my Indiegogo! This campaign is all about monsters... don't worry, they are plush and don't bite. I have been designing and creating plush for over 3 years now and love every inch of what I create. My plush are all handmade using crochet with a tiny hook and yarn. All of my plush are unique, not one is like the other. My inspiration comes from street art and the amazing colorful portraits you see on the side of buildings. I simply love color and I love unusual color combinations!
The goal of this campaign is to keep my shop going and spread more monster plush love! I am also pursuing to get my patterns into a crochet book, so funding will help to build the supplies to make all the samples needed for this project as well.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Jitterbug Jive here, the artist of Discord Whooves and many other tumblr blogs. I am also PierceSmoulder, the director/writer of Doctor Whooves and Assistant. These projects are large, and involve many people thus making us a team. And I'm asking for help on funding a few things, including upgrades in our tools, Bronycon funding for prints and merchandise at the vendor's booth, and finally helping a voice actor (TehCityBeast) to be able to visit with his special somepony. This means a lot to all of us, but of course we're not going to leave everyone empty handed, so here is what this will all amount to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A parody/cover of the song 'Be Prepared' from the Lion King, sung by The Valeyard and Octavia (Villains that have not yet quite made themselves known to the Discord Whooves universe)</li>
<li>The Voice actors will be City and PierceSmoulder/BaldDumboRat</li>
<li>But we're not stopping at just a cover. We will make this a full animatic storyboard, possibly all in color and in near movie quality, as seen in this sample here:<img alt=""Be Prepared"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://25.media.tumblr.com/3ca94d147e1d1ed76058aac9f55e04d7/tumblr_mneg9pXXwB1rkacgxo1_500.png"" src="""" style=""""/>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We've been trying to get together funds for Bronycon for quite some time now, and thanks to your generosity we've been able to afford the tickets and flights for five team members and a booth in the vendor's hall. But that all cost quite a lot of money, and now we're asking for just a bit more in order to provide quality products at the table. Even if we do or don't reach our goal though, all of the money will be going to City, Bronycon Funding, and to upgrade our tools such as better microphones for voice actors in DWnA and if possible better programs for better production. And the song will still be released of course, along with an animatic (Though quality might not be as high on the art-side if the goal isn't made) People will still recieve their prizes as well.</p>
<p>Even donations of small to larger amounts can get you prizes, so you're not just donating to nothing! Here's what you can expect:</p>
<p>5$ will get your name mentioned as a thank you in the credits of the video</p>
<p>10$ will get you a personal thank you from Octavia where she will read out your name. (BaldDumboRat)</p>
<p>15$ will get a thank you from both Octavia and Valeyard together</p>
<p>(The donations below are first come, first serve)</p>
<p>25$ up to 20 people will recieve a signed quality poster print of the animatic frame sample seen above. (Signed by the artist, Jitterbug Jive)</p>
<p>100$ will give five people their character a cameo in the animatic (Note they will likely become a 'victim', they also can only be a pony and no alicorns)</p>
<p>200$ will give 3 people a bundle pack. That's a personal thank you read out by the characters, the above poster, 5 prints from the finished animatic, a and character cameo in the animatic</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
With proper funding not only will we give you a quality animatic and song, but we will also be able to provide better prints, posters, buttons, and other merchandise at the Vendor's table. If we make enough, we can even sell products on-line for fans who might not be able to attend.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Even if you can't send any donations, this is fine! You can help by spreading the word and letting other people know about this project!</div>

</p><p><b>ABOUT THE PROJECT</b></p>
<p>‘<i>A Force of Nature’</i> – The Stage</p>
<p>Selina Thompson is an artist
and performer based in Leeds, United Kingdom. She makes work that is urgent,
playful and intimate – whether that’s by building a giant dress out of cake
with over 2000 people in a shopping centre for 2 days, sharing stories with
people inside a 7ft ball of hair, or touring her highly acclaimed solo shows
across the country. </p>
<p>Selina makes work that opens up
spaces for us to talk as honestly, openly and clumsily, as experts of our own experience, about the things that we need to. She’s worked in
hairdressers and barbers in Chapeltown to become an ‘expert’ in afro hair.
Spent 6 months with the employees and service users of a Leeds City Centre Job
Centre. And for the last 12 months, she has worked in 6 cities in the UK to
meet and speak with people  - academics, the women she went to school with, teenagers, writers, other artists, hairdressers, chefs, and her Nan, Grandad and God-Daughter about what it means to be Black, and living in
Britain in 2015. How we came to be where we are now, and what the future might
be.</p>
<p>Now, in 2016, Selina has set
herself a new challenge in order to meet, speak and work with more people. But
we need your help to get her there.<br/>
<br/>
<b>SALT.</b></p>
<p>At the end of an entire year of
speaking with over 850 people in the UK, Selina’s ready to create a new theatre
show. ‘Salt.’ will be premiered at this year’s Mayfest in Bristol, transferred
to Leeds for Yorkshire Festival and then toured internationally throughout
2018.</p>
<p>Salt. is about grief, ancestry,
home, forgetting and colonialism – how those big words and concepts can all
converge onto one body, and one story. It will feel like a descent into the
depths of the ocean - beautiful, mythical and powerful, doing justice to the
size and scale of its subject matter.</p>
<p><b>THE VOYAGE</b></p>
<p>As the final stage of
researching this project, Selina will be sailing – on a cargo ship - along one
route of the Transatlantic Trade Triangle. The voyage will take her from the
UK, to Ghana, and Jamaica before returning home with the stories, reflections and experiences that she needs to finish making a show that holds the pyshic weight of that journey.</p>
<p>It will take 2 months – 42 days
at sea in total. </p>
<p>Selina will be travelling with filmmaker Hayley Reid to document the journey. Together, they will meet and begin
collaborations with artists and academics whose work explores a similar
territory: conducting interviews, sharing meals together and reflecting on the
questions ‘Salt.’ is asking. </p>
<p>It’s the trip of a lifetime.
The furthest Selina has ever been from home, for the longest she has ever been
from home, and the journey her dad always wanted to make and never got to.</p>
<p>We want you to be a part of
this journey with us.</p>
<p><b>WHERE IT WILL BE SPENT</b></p>
<p>After one year of hustling and
brutal budgeting, we have raised 75% of the total cost of this trip. With only
£2750 to go, here’s what we have left to pay for:<br/>
<br/>
- Some bits of kit and equipment to make sure the footage can turn into the
most beautiful film it can be.<br/>
- Money towards expenses and making sure they can travel comfortably (not 5 star comfort, obviously! Just ensuring we've got enough fuel to work and make the best work we can).<br/>
- Some mental and physical health support for them both as they embark on a
mentally and physically challenging journey.</p><p><b><span>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</span></b></p>
<p>Physical and mental risks and
challenges are scattered throughout this journey – but your money is in
completely safe hands.</p>
<p>We have the support of 2 major
international festivals in the UK – Mayfest and Yorkshire Festival – and have
undertaken a detailed period of research before committing to the trip.</p>
<p>We’re working with some incredible local groups in Accra and Kingston to introduce us and show us around, provide
enough context for us to create genuine relationships with those we meet and
the beginnings of a long term collaborations that could see artists from all three continents hosting one another.</p>
<p>We’ve had advice and support
from Rose George – who has written an incredible book on the shipping industry (Deep Sea and Foreign Going, you should buy it),
and has undertaken a series of journeys on cargo ships (thank you!) And are
working with The Cruise People who have taken great care to help us to plan and map out all elements
of the voyage. </p>
<p>Finally, we continue to have
the support of the force of nature that is Emma Beverley, our Producer – she's worked with us to build a
project and budget that is robust and substantial enough to ward off any
unexpected incidents. </p>

<div>My name is Mari Ma and I am currently a senior at Drexel University's Entertainment and Arts Management. <span style=""background-color: initial;""><b><i>The Sing and Tell Cabaret</i></b> is an event where undergraduate students and professional artist collaborate together to perform contemporary musical theatre works that not many outside the industry have even heard of.</span>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>I hope this event will be able to cultivate a professional relationship between the
current and up and coming talents. Helping these undergraduate students to gain valuable
experiences and networking opportunity, while performing contemporary works that have not yet
been exposed to the general Philadelphia market. </p>
<p>Here are two examples:</p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/rZJAS80hok8"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ek6LO-3ORtM"" width=""560""></iframe></div>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Your funding will help bring this event to the amazing space of World Cafe Live, and will give undergraduate artists who are looking to pursue a career in the arts a jump start with a legitimate paying gig!</p>
<p><b><i>The song list are to be revealed the day before Christmas! GET PUMPED</i></b></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This idea of cultivating professional relationship between the two demographic stems from the Drexel Co-Op Theatre’s residency shows. I was part of the program for two years and have done two different professional shows with Philadelphia Artist's Collective and Simpatico Theatre Company. The experience of working with theatre professionals opened up my eyes and in my opinion, it was extremely valuable as an undergraduate. Recently I attended the Barrymore Award (an award show dedicated to the Philadelphia theatre community) and it blew my mind just how many directors, designers, creators, and actors I have already gotten the pleasure to work with. I hope to recreate and expand on that idea to create an event that can showcase the up and coming talents, while providing them with the opportunity to work in a professional setting to garner experiences and relationships with the tight knit Philadelphia theatre community. </span></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>I am in need of $2,750 to bring this event into World Cafe Live, which have the ability to provide the event refreshment and the cabaret atmosphere, and compensate the artists, both students and professional. If you have not experienced a cabaret before, it is extremely vital for the audience to be able to enjoy a drink or two and some food while listening to the performer's lovely performance. The atmosphere that it creates help draw people in, demonstrated by the success and popularity of 54 Below and other similar venues. </div>
<div>On the right we have our perks. Beside tickets to an amazing show and free booze (<b>yay!</b>), we also have signed posters as well as an amazing chance to be mentioned in the show as a special shoutout during the performance! I am extremely grateful for anyone who donates regardless of amounts. The different perks is to make sure everyone who donate get what they deserve PLUS my undying gratitude!</div>
<div>*All funds raised in this campaign will still go towards the event if I do not reach my entire goal, then there might be change in event location and I would notify all of those who donated.</div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">One of the biggest risks of this event would be the weather. Since this event is set to be held in Jan 19th, 2016, there is a chance that there would be weather realted incident such as snow storm or ice-y road which prohibit some of you from coming. But I am diligent having this event unless they close down the venue for these reasons.</span></h3> </div> <div> <h3>You Can Always Help</h3>
<div>I am a college student, I absolutely understand that sometimes, even $5 is over the weekly allotted budget. If you cannot contribute for any reasons at all but still want to help out, please share and let all your friends and family know about this. Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit ... etc. Spread it, post them all. I really appreciates all that because.... money isn't everything!</div> <p><br/></p>

current and up and coming talents. Helping these undergraduate students to gain valuable
experiences and networking opportunity, while performing contemporary works that have not yet
been exposed to the general Philadelphia market. 
Here are two examples:







Your funding will help bring this event to the amazing space of World Cafe Live, and will give undergraduate artists who are looking to pursue a career in the arts a jump start with a legitimate paying gig!
The song list are to be revealed the day before Christmas! GET PUMPED








The Impact


This idea of cultivating professional relationship between the two demographic stems from the Drexel Co-Op Theatre’s residency shows. I was part of the program for two years and have done two different professional shows with Philadelphia Artist's Collective and Simpatico Theatre Company. The experience of working with theatre professionals opened up my eyes and in my opinion, it was extremely valuable as an undergraduate. Recently I attended the Barrymore Award (an award show dedicated to the Philadelphia theatre community) and it blew my mind just how many directors, designers, creators, and actors I have already gotten the pleasure to work with. I hope to recreate and expand on that idea to create an event that can showcase the up and coming talents, while providing them with the opportunity to work in a professional setting to garner experiences and relationships with the tight knit Philadelphia theatre community. 
   What We Need & What You Get
I am in need of $2,750 to bring this event into World Cafe Live, which have the ability to provide the event refreshment and the cabaret atmosphere, and compensate the artists, both students and professional. If you have not experienced a cabaret before, it is extremely vital for the audience to be able to enjoy a drink or two and some food while listening to the performer's lovely performance. The atmosphere that it creates help draw people in, demonstrated by the success and popularity of 54 Below and other similar venues. 
On the right we have our perks. Beside tickets to an amazing show and free booze (yay!), we also have signed posters as well as an amazing chance to be mentioned in the show as a special shoutout during the performance! I am extremely grateful for anyone who donates regardless of amounts. The different perks is to make sure everyone who donate get what they deserve PLUS my undying gratitude!
*All funds raised in this campaign will still go towards the event if I do not reach my entire goal, then there might be change in event location and I would notify all of those who donated.

    Risks & Challenges
One of the biggest risks of this event would be the weather. Since this event is set to be held in Jan 19th, 2016, there is a chance that there would be weather realted incident such as snow storm or ice-y road which prohibit some of you from coming. But I am diligent having this event unless they close down the venue for these reasons.   You Can Always Help
I am a college student, I absolutely understand that sometimes, even $5 is over the weekly allotted budget. If you cannot contribute for any reasons at all but still want to help out, please share and let all your friends and family know about this. Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit ... etc. Spread it, post them all. I really appreciates all that because.... money isn't everything!",0.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Ari, a.k.a, aricoco. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I am an interdisciplinary artist based in Brooklyn, New York.

<p>I am interested in how social insects such as ants and bees construct and maintain their colony.

selection of my older pieces, my new series. It is something totally different
for me, an evolution and an revolution! I promise you something extravagant,
colorful et ludic. A parade of everything that influenced my artistic path and
my life. An exhibition of me!
All the people that knows me, knows the passion I have about my
work and my subject matter. This exhibition in Montreal will be an important
step in my carrier. And I couldn’t do it in any other place than Espace Projet.
The gallery that literally tooks me inside its walls. Come share this dream
with me!

The money will
serve for the production of my new work, the materials for the exhibition
production and a publication. You can choose one of the perks, or give as much as you can. And don't forget to share the campaign with all your friends!  Thank you!Ludji_____________________________________________________________________________N'oubliez pas de jeter un coup d'oeil sur mon nouveau site-webNão se esqueçam de dar uma olhada no meu site novo!Don't forget to take a look at my new websitehttp://ludmilaberg1.wix.com/ludmilasteckelberg",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Create-A-Kits (CAK for short) are mix and match do-it-yourself sculptures for making your own customized character figurine. There are currently already a few different pieces to choose from and more pieces are being made. CAK are currently made by hand using a sculpted master copy of the figurine piece, hand poured mold, and hand poured resin casted duplicates - though I have plans to get them factory reproduced if I they become popular enough.</p>
<p>With the CAK you can make your own original character figurine with only minor crafting/sculpting abilities. Just pick the body pieces you want and put them together and sculpt the details such as hair and clothes and then paint! Pre-made clothing and hair styles are planned and eventually all that a buyer will need to do to have a completely custom figurine is to pick your choice of pieces, put it all together and paint however you wish! (I'd like to point out that while the only examples currently shown are cartoon animals, there are already human heads available for those who want a human figurine.)</p>
<p>Deuxmos.com is the dedicated website for Create-A-Kits but it is more than just a web store to buy the kits.The site also has a forum to be used by interested people for anything from asking for help and tips on customizing their own CAK, sculpting and other artistic advice or just plain fun and chatting with one another. There will also be an artist's corner for people offering their customization skills of kits for one on one commissions with interested people, as well as tutorials, photo galleries and more!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>My name is Leslie Merz and I am a freelance sculptor. I graduated the Art Institute of California - San Diego in 2008 with a bachelor's degree in Media Art and Animation. Because of the five year minimum experience requirement to work for most studios, I have been working as a One of a Kind (OOAK) sculptor for commissions over at DeviantArt for the last three years (aachi-chan.deviantart.com). I have had customers all over the world, from here in the United States, to the United Kingdom, Canada, Holland, Australia and other countries. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have wanted to make molds of my sculptures and cast them in resin to sell for quite some time. Most of the people who commission me for a custom figurine ask me for their furry fan character, this is what led me to believe that making a mix and match garage kit (do-it-yourself character figurine kits) in that same art style would be the best project to start with. This way, I can bring custom character sculptures to people at a much cheaper price than my OOAKs and therefore sell more of them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>As I have previously gotten a good start on this project a few months ago thanks to Indiegogo and my own funding efforts, I am now in the middle phases of the project. Currently, I am in need of funding for the website's own hosting (it is currently being hosted on a friend's extra space and maintained by her because she's so awesome and nice), legal fees involved with developing my own product, advertising costs for the website, equipment costs (as my one and only laptop is on its last stretch of life and it would be really hard to run an internet business if it died and left me without a computer), home business insurance (as it was recommended to me to have this), I also need money for filing as LLC (I am currently running as Sole Proprietor but not yet legally filed as such and don't want to continue this way anymore than I absolutely must) as well as money for the never ending material requirements. In addition to these, there are also tons of other things I need money for to make this small business of mine work such as business cards, shipping supplies, bulk purchases of art supplies so I can resell them on the site at wholesale price, just to name a few.</p>
<p>My projected startup costs for what I want to do with Deuxmos and the Create-A-Kits is actually around $10,000, but I think that a goal of $3000 will be a really good start to get things going.</p>
<p>(You can see the original Indiegogo campaign for this project here <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/Create-a-hedgehog?a=241271"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.indiegogo.com/Create-a-hedgehog?a=241271</a> you might notice that that campaign belongs to a different account than this one. That is because with this account, I am a part of Fractured Atlas' Fiscal Sponsorship program and the email address I used with them and that they used to automatically sign me up for this Indiegogo project is different than the one I used on the original project. I didn't see the point in contacting them to combine the two campaigns onto the same account since the previous account has long since gone past it's deadline anyway. Giving you a link to the original and telling you why it isn't on this same account seems just fine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>Silicone molding and resin is expensive, so are legal fees, website hosting fees, maintenance fees, and every other thing on the long list of things I need to pay for.</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of costs (This is what it costs for me. Prices for what it costs for a buyer can be found on the online store of Deuxmos.com for items that are already available for sale.)</p>
<p>~~~~~</p>
<p>These here are ongoing material costs, this is just the price of a single order of each described. But I go through these materials quickly and I have no idea how much I might use in the end since I still have a lot of errors that happen and I need to make new molds all over again sometimes and resin casts that need to be thrown away because of way too many bubbles in it and things like that. However, even with those learning curves using the mold and cast materials, I would still have to make new molds when old ones wear out and buy more resin for the more orders I get.</p>
<p>So basically, buying these materials is more or less neverending.</p>
<p>Moldmaking material pint (2 lbs.) - $30.11</p>
<p>Moldmaking material 1 gallon (18 lbs.) - $172.94</p>
<p>Resin pint (1.9 lbs) - $25.96</p>
<p>Resin 1 gallons (15.4 lbs.) - $85.85</p>
<p>Release agent - $11 a can</p>
<p>Apoxie for making master copies 4 lb. - $35</p>
<p>~~~~</p>
<p>These are also costs that will continue the more that people buy from me, but I have to find the money somewhere to even just get started to be able to offer these items for sale</p>
<p>Tools - $130 for 12 sets (Still need to contact them to find out 'bulk order with intent to resell' costs)</p>
<p>Apoxie clay 1/4 lb. each unit (for resell) - 37 units minimum order for $204</p>
<p>Aves Safety Solvent 1 oz. (for resell - Safety Solvent is for smoothing wet Apoxie clay and cleanup - it's incredibly useful) - $200 minimum bulk purchase</p>
<p>Plus there are more art supplies that I would like to eventually offer for sale on my website, such as quality paints and brushes. And of course I need to pay extra for shipping for all of these supplies and materials.</p>
<p>~~~~</p>
<p>Computer (as I said, I need this before the only one I have dies) - approximately $800 (though I would get the cheapest one I can find of course, but I'd rather set aside too much money than not enough)</p>
<p>Legal and accounting fees - Estimate $2000 (though probably more, Not even kidding... it's a LOT to file LLC and trademarks)</p>
<p>Insurance - $275 a year</p>
<p>Business cards - Approx. $30</p>
<p>Adverting - Approx. $50 a month (I'm guessing blindly at this number as I have no experience to base this on yet)</p>
<p>Annual website expenses, ssl cert, data, merchant account, etc - Approx. $2000</p>
<p>and I know there are lots of other things that I can't think at the moment or just can't think of how much it might cost if I do them (such as costs for going to comic conventions and having a booth to sell my kits - business expenses that will definitely help my sales)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>For certain donation amount, you can get your very own kit to customize or blank animal earrings/keychains to paint yourself. Small donation will get a thank you picture of Deuxmos' mascot Lexi. Unlike the first Indiegogo project, I will not offer painted items as I need to spend my time on the project itself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please make a note or contact me about what it is you would like for your item (i.e. what pieces you want for your kit, what kind of keychain/earrings you want)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Shipping</p>
<p>Shipping is included in the item price for the U.S. and Canada ONLY. For shipping out of the country, please contact me and I will figure out how much extra shipping will cost to send to you and then you give the appropriate purchase/donation price for the item you want to get.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Incentive/purchase list</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>For kit pieces, please check the gallery on this campaign to see what pieces are currently available. For pieces that are not made yet that you would want, please send me a message and I will tell you if that piece type is planned or not. If I think what you are wanting is a good piece type, then I'll probably add it to my list of pieces to make.</p>
<p>$1 - You will get a colored image of Deuxmos' mascot, Lexi, saying thank you.</p>
<p>$6 - unpainted keychain (your choice of cat, dog, sugar glider, rabbit, fox, rat/mouse or Halloween king)</p>
<p>$8 - unpainted earrings, fishhook posts only (your choice of cat, dog, sugar glider, rabbit, fox, rat/mouse or Halloween king)</p>
<p>$15 - 1/4 lb.  Apoxie clay</p>
<p>$45 - Create-A-Kit with your choice of pieces of head, body, left and right arms, shoes, with an unpainted metal disc base.<strong> No tools or clay.</strong></p>
<p>$50 - Create-A-Kit with your choice of pieces of animal ears, animal tail, head, body, left and right arms, shoes, with an unpainted metal disc base. <strong><strong>No tools or clay.</strong></strong></p>
<p>$60 - Create-A-Kit with your choice of pieces of head, body, left and right arms, shoes, with an unpainted metal disc base <strong>Also with 1/4 lb. Apoxie clay</strong></p>
<p>$65 - Create-A-Kit with your choice of pieces of animal ears, animal tail, head, body, left and right arms, shoes, with an unpainted metal disc base <strong>Also with 1/4 lb. Apoxie clay</strong></p>
<p>I'm not going to be offering sculpting tools as a part of any perks this time, but if you need them for your kits and you don't have an art store anywhere neaby where you can get some, please message me. I might still have a spare set available to sell to you.</p>

Spread the word! If you don't have the money to help, share it with your friends. I understand not everyone is going to be able to help with money. I also offer my sewing services (alterations, custom orders/costumes, ect.) if you prefer having something in exchange for the help.
