<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p>The mission of Dress for Success® Central Virginia is to promote the economic independence of disadvantaged women by providing professional attire, a network of support and the career development tools to help women thrive in work and in life. Dress for Success provides our clients the tools and confidence they need to take charge and achieve success in both their personal and professional lives.</p>
<p>We offer every client a confidence-boosting personal shopping experience and Career Center consultation as she graduate from a local agency or nonprofit’s job readiness program, prepares for her job interviews, and launches her new career.   </p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>It’s no secret that today’s job market is rough. Unemployment, job applications, interviews, rejections – these things take a toll on your self-confidence. As every woman knows, what you wear has a huge impact on how you feel, and looking good and feeling good build self-confidence. By providing professional attire and a supportive environment to a woman fighting to regain her footing, Dress for Success Central Virginia helps to restore her self-confidence, which increases her chance of success in a competitive job market. </p>
<p>The impact is not limited to the direct effect on the clients themselves. Working women have an outstanding impact on the economy as a whole. Many women are the primary care-takers of their family; hence helping a woman achieve economic independence has a ripple effect on the well-being of her children and her community.   </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>Dress for Success Central Virginia is opening our new boutique this month. To help us launch this ambitious mission, we ask for your support in suiting our first 30 clients. Just imagine the potential impact if we could suit one woman like Veda every day for one month!  The average cost of one (1) woman’s suit is $100. Your donation, no matter the size, can put us one step closer to writing another wonderful success story.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>As Veda states in the video, working with Dress for Success gave her the ability to make strides toward her goals of becoming independent, employed and actively contributing to society.  Her story illustrates the effectiveness of the Dress for Success program.   In addition to your monetary donation we ask that you also consider donating your precious time, talent and/or treasure to help women like Veda.

<p><span class=""text_exposed_show"">The zine will express and explore all aspects of mental health, positive and negative, in an effort to engage the public with an issue which is often taboo and shied away from.

<h3>L'aventure à moto</h3>
<p>Après plusieurs voyages à travers le monde à moto, j'ai décidé de faire profiter aux autres motards de mon expérience. J'ai commencé la rédaction d'un livre qui montre qu'il n'est pas si difficile de partir pour plusieurs mois sur sa moto, mais que cela nécessite toutefois une bonne préparation.</p>
<p>Pour mon premier voyage je suis parti avec un ami avec comme but la Mongolie, et si possible plus. Finalement je suis arrivé jusqu'en Inde et au Népal en passant par l'Asie centrale et la Chine. Un voyage d'une année et demi, avec de nombreuses galères et des rencontres étonnantes. </p>
<p>Nourri de cette expérience, je suis reparti, seul, et parfois en couple, pour un tour de l'Afrique, par des itinéraires inédits. Bien que le voyage soit plus difficile, j'étais mieux préparé et j'ai connu relativement peu de problèmes pendant ces 2 ans.</p>
<p>De retour au pays j'étais plus riche de souvenirs et d'expérience, mais plus pauvre matériellement. Cette expérience incroyable m'a donnée envie d'inciter et aider d'autres motards à vivre l'aventure de leur vie. Personne n'aime les guides techniques et austères, donc j'ai mis dans ce livre des tas d'anecdotes drôles et étonnantes qui ont pour but de dédramatiser le voyage dans des pays pas toujours faciles, et surtout de faire rêver.</p>
<p>Le livre contiendra également de nombreuses cartes détaillées sur les itinéraires proposés et de beaucoup de petits trucs pratiques issus de mon expérience du voyage. </p>
<h3><strong>Le projet</strong></h3>
<p>J'ai donc laissé reposé ma moto, je me suis atablé devant mon ordinateur (rescapé du précédent voyage) et j'ai commencé à écrire. Après plusieurs mois de travail intensif, le livre est maintenant bien avancé, et vous pouvez d'ailleurs en télécharger un extrait pour vous donner une idée du résultat. Mais j'approche maintenant d'un obstacle majeur : l'édition et la publication de mon ouvrage. Lorsqu'on ne s'appelle pas <span>Michel Houellebecq il est très difficile de retenir l'attention d'un édteur. </span></p>
<p><span>L'aventure aurait pu en rester là, ou résulter en un e-book peu agréable à consulter. </span>Je me suis donc tourné vers l'auto-édition, qui est maintenant devenue possible. Avec un peu d'aide je peux m'occuper de la mise en page et de la finition. Toutefois reste l'impression, qui a un coût important et incompressible. Cette campagne de financement participatif a pour but de me permettre de lancer la première impression de mon livre.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>Ce qui me manque et ce que vous obtiendrez</strong></h3>
<p>La rédaction du texte et la composition des nombreuse cartes sont en bonne voie. Ensuite viendra la mise en page, pour laquelle je me ferai aider. Je me trounerai ensuite vers un imprimeur en France pour préparer une impression offset. Le prix est variable selon le format, le type de papier, et la quantité de planches photos, 7500 € étant le minimum pour démarrer avec un format très simple.</p>
<p>Si la campagne rapporte plus, je pourrai choisir un meilleur papier et ajouter des planches photos en couleurs. </p>
<p>Si les fonds ne sont pas réunis, je lancerai quand même une impression en numérique, qui permet actuellement des petites séries à un prix plus élevé qu'en offset, mais raisonable si on se passe de planches couleurs. Donc dans tous les cas, vous recevrez un exemplaire du livre si vous y avez souscrit.</p>
<p>Les fonds seront dédiés intégralement à l'impression des livres, quoi qu'il arrive (moins la taxe prise par IndieGogo).</p>

<p><span>En 2005, à 38 ans, Laurent Bendel quitte sa Suisse natale et son métier d’informaticien pour 2 ans de voyage à moto. Il traverse les steppes de Mongolie, les montagnes d’Asie Centrale et de l’Himalaya pour atteindre l’Inde et le Népal.

<h3>Comment participer</h3>
<p>Toutes les participation sont les bienvenues, c'est l'effet de masse et la solidarité des motards qui permettent à de tels projet d'aboutir. Que vous soyiez intéressé par le livre ou que vous vouliez uniquement soutenir financièrement le projet, l'important est de participer.</p>

Le livre contiendra également de nombreuses cartes détaillées sur les itinéraires proposés et de beaucoup de petits trucs pratiques issus de mon expérience du voyage. 
Le projet
J'ai donc laissé reposé ma moto, je me suis atablé devant mon ordinateur (rescapé du précédent voyage) et j'ai commencé à écrire. Après plusieurs mois de travail intensif, le livre est maintenant bien avancé, et vous pouvez d'ailleurs en télécharger un extrait pour vous donner une idée du résultat. Mais j'approche maintenant d'un obstacle majeur : l'édition et la publication de mon ouvrage. Lorsqu'on ne s'appelle pas Michel Houellebecq il est très difficile de retenir l'attention d'un édteur. 
L'aventure aurait pu en rester là, ou résulter en un e-book peu agréable à consulter. Je me suis donc tourné vers l'auto-édition, qui est maintenant devenue possible. Avec un peu d'aide je peux m'occuper de la mise en page et de la finition. Toutefois reste l'impression, qui a un coût important et incompressible. Cette campagne de financement participatif a pour but de me permettre de lancer la première impression de mon livre.


Ce qui me manque et ce que vous obtiendrez
La rédaction du texte et la composition des nombreuse cartes sont en bonne voie. Ensuite viendra la mise en page, pour laquelle je me ferai aider. Je me trounerai ensuite vers un imprimeur en France pour préparer une impression offset. Le prix est variable selon le format, le type de papier, et la quantité de planches photos, 7500 € étant le minimum pour démarrer avec un format très simple.
Si la campagne rapporte plus, je pourrai choisir un meilleur papier et ajouter des planches photos en couleurs. 
Si les fonds ne sont pas réunis, je lancerai quand même une impression en numérique, qui permet actuellement des petites séries à un prix plus élevé qu'en offset, mais raisonable si on se passe de planches couleurs. Donc dans tous les cas, vous recevrez un exemplaire du livre si vous y avez souscrit.
Les fonds seront dédiés intégralement à l'impression des livres, quoi qu'il arrive (moins la taxe prise par IndieGogo).

This campaign aims at financing the publication of my book on overlanding with a motorbike, which I'm currently writing. The book will be in French, so non-Fench speakers may not be interested by the book, but they still may want to contribute to my project, and that would be much appreciated.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Origin of The Untold Narratives</h3>
<p>The team at <i>The Untold Narratives</i> is currently made up of Elizabeth Santiago, PhD and Victoria Delvalle, but the origin of this idea started with me, Elizabeth, in childhood.  I had always been reluctant to share that I grew up on government assistance, that my parents didn’t speak English, that I dropped out of high school and that I was the first in my immediate family to go to college. In my experience, these realities can either be held up in educational and work spaces as proof that you can achieve if you have the right determination, or they are looked upon with pity. Both reactions have caused me personal shame because one infers that I have in some inadvertent way proven I am more determined than others, and the other insinuates that my childhood existence was somehow wrong. In reflecting on that shame, I have come to realize that it is rare for many people of color, immigrants, indigenous peoples and other marginalized people to experience in their formal education (whether k-12 or postsecondary) a libera­tory process of learning that engages their full identity and honors their realities without judging experiences or offering alienating solutions.</p>
<p>As I navigated educational spaces, the most authentic way I could share my story was through creative means. Creative writing offered me a way to tell a more nuanced story than just, “I grew up on welfare.” I could share an anecdote about my experience and own the way I wanted it to be presented. For example, I could share that as a child, I learned if you took food stamps (yes the original, paper food stamps) to the corner market in our neighborhood the store owner would change them to quarters. I could then buy a little doll that we couldn’t otherwise afford. Through creative writing, I could paint the picture of the market as welcoming. I could describe the people in the market as friendly and loving. They certainly didn’t have to carry little dolls in their mini-food mart, but they did. I could control the message in order to make it a more holistic depiction of the reality versus allowing someone else the opportunity to make judgements of what being on welfare meant based on what they heard or read.</p>
<p>The more I tell my story the more I understand the nature of power and truth, and the ways in which stories empower and connect. I spent my life working on the goal of cultivating and sharing untold narratives. I became a writing teacher partnering with students who didn't like to write. I studied and researched ways to engage reluctant writers eventually earning a PhD focusing on storytelling in underrepresented or marginalized communities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To provide an outlet for the creation and distribution of stories, I conceptualized <i>The Untold Narratives</i>, a web site that anyone can access to learn the craft of writing while building community with others. I enlisted the help of Victoria Delvalle who is a college student, visual artist, and poet to help with the creative design of the site. The funding will support the development of a prototype of the theuntoldnarratives.com. For the prototype, we will be using Wix.com, a user-friendly website builder. This will allow us to work quickly to get a prototype into the hands of users. The majority of the funds will go toward the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Content development. </strong>Specifically, we want to populate the site with stories. We plan to connect to community-based organizations to cultivate stories, put out a call for writers on social media and build a repository of pre-existing stories that feature hidden narratives such as those featuring histories of marginalized communities that are not normally featured or elevated. Funds from this campaign will also go toward paying writers as appropriate.</li>
<li>
<strong>Creative Design. </strong>We started building out the creative design of the site, but we need to continue and finalize. </li>
<li>
<strong>Focus Groups.</strong> Once the prototype is complete and we have cultivated content, we will bring the site to users to provide feedback. This will help us refine the design, navigation and content areas for later launch.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Costs associated with Wix.com and securing our domain name have already been covered through individual donations.</i></p>
<p>If you back this project, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receive early access to new content as it gets developed,</li>
<li>Be given the ability to provide feedback on the site's development,</li>
<li>Be invited to share content or potential writers,</li>
<li>Be credited on the <i>About</i> page on the site, and</li>
<li>Receive a monthly newsletter highlighting featured content once the prototype is launched.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we do not meet our funding goal, we will use what we have raised to build out as much of the content of the site as possible and, hopefully, conduct at least one focus group.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Put Your Trust in Us?</h3>
<p>I have been a storyteller since I was a child and the site is truly the culmination of my life's work. I worked in publishing building out content for textbooks. I earned a master's degree in education focusing on the role technology plays in the learning process. With that, I was able to build out large-scale technology concepts such as websites to support textbooks and communities of practice. The process we are using to develop this site (i.e., prototype, user feedback, etc.) is a standard development process and a process I am more than comfortable in executing. I most recently earned a PhD focusing on using storytelling to build literacy skills in older students. </p>
<p>Victoria Delvalle is a junior at New York University Tisch School of the Arts. She is a visual artist and poet who has both the design and content skills to be a founding member of <i>The Untold Narratives</i>. She competed in slam poetry tournaments and has completed freelance art projects in the City of Boston. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks and challenges to any endeavor. We anticipate that we will run into hiccups along the way. The most pressing is connecting with potential writers. It's extremely important that stories be authentic and varied, so we need to connect to as many storytellers as possible. How we do that during a global pandemic will pose a challenge. We plan to connect to as many community-based programs as we can and do a call over social media including building out a Facebook community. We also hope that you, as a backer, will offer any connections you have to youth groups, adult learning centers and other community-based organizations to support building a broader community of storytellers</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you've read this far, we appreciate you! We know that it's not always possible to give financially, but if you are interested in this project, please share our campaign widely on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. </p>

This includes how to research a person or an organization effectively and create the most effective and personalized message for the person you want to reach out to. The more you know about a person, what they are passionate about, why they are doing what they are doing, and what they know in terms of professional and personal experiences, the better chance you have of getting through to them.

<h3>What We Want To Do</h3>
<p>Stories have the singular power to bring attention to our common humanity. This is what the world needs now. As the premier site for world literature in translation, <i>Asymptote</i> wants to provide a high-profile platform for writers and artists from the seven countries on Trump's list.</p>
<p>With your support, we will undertake large-scale editorial research and commission new work—and new translations—from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, specifically <i>work in response to Trump’s executive order</i>. A minimum of two works from each of these countries will be published either in our Spring (April) 2017 edition at <a href=""http://asymptotejournal.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our website</a> or at our partner newspaper, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/translation-tuesdays-by-asymptote-journal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Guardian</i></a> (here’s an <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/translation-tuesdays-by-asymptote-journal/2017/jan/31/translation-tuesday-two-prose-poems-by-ghayath-almadhoun"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">example</a> of what you can look forward to). All contributors to this Feature will be paid.</p>
<p>In addition, one standout article from this extensive showcase will be selected for a multiple-translation project, which will see <i>Asymptote </i>commission 10 to 20 additional translations to propel this project beyond the English-language community (much as we did last year with Pedro Novoa's <a href=""http://www.asymptotejournal.com/fiction/pedro-novoa-the-dive/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">stunning story</a> in our Summer 2016 Issue). We will also include a special section in the educator’s guide accompanying the Spring 2017 edition, to facilitate the introduction of this Special Feature in classrooms around the world.</p>

<h3>How Will Our Work Make a Difference?</h3>
<p>In a world beset by reactionary politics and hyper-nationalism, literature can build bridges across the chasms that try to divide us.</p>
<p><i>Asymptote</i>'s Special Feature showcasing the work of writers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen will raise awareness about what life is like for people living in these conflict-ridden countries. At a time when the safety and dignity of their people are being denied, we hope that this Special Feature will serve to amplify their voices.</p>
<p>But publication of this Special Feature alone is not enough to guarantee it a wide audience, even if our showcase will be freely available to anyone with an Internet connection, as with everything we publish. To make sure this work we do makes an impact, we will invest heavily in promoting the Feature through paid ads, online promotion via our eight social media platforms in three languages, and the distribution of 5,000 postcards across six continents. </p>
<p>For all of this to happen, we need to raise USD30,000.</p>
<p>The more we raise, the more we can do! If we surpass our target and hit USD45,000, we’ll publish a print anthology of the work to be distributed worldwide; if we hit USD60,000, we’ll organize a large-scale event in New York or London, featuring authors from this showcase.</p>
<p>In solidarity with those whose lives have been disrupted by Trump’s travel ban, <strong>we pledge 20% of all funds raised to the ACLU and Refugees Welcome</strong>. Help us show them that you care.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Readers, Writers, Editors, and Friends of Ninebark Press,</strong></p>
<p>We are very happy to announce our newest project, <i>[It] Incandescent,</i> by Amy Pence. </p>
<p><i>[It] Incandescent </i>puts us on the path near Emily Dickinson’s home in a timeless Amherst where we embark on a multi-layered journey: poems written by a fictional narrator are interceded by details from Dickinson’s life as well as the tragic story that propels the narrator to a stunning, yet indeterminate, conclusion. What was Dickinson’s “secret” and how does the experience of trauma both obscure and reveal? In this truly sui generis book, poetry, fiction, and fact blend, reminding us of the complex tissue of narratives and psychologies whenever we try to uncover the truth of someone’s life, especially Emily Dickinson’s.</p>
<p>Amy Pence has authored the poetry collections <i>Armor, Amour</i> (Ninebark Press), <i>The Decadent Lovely </i>(Main Street Rag), and the chapbook, <i>Skin’s Dark Night</i> (2River Press). She has been honored with the Claire Keyes Poetry Award and has published in a variety of journals, including <i>The Antioch Review</i>, <i>The Oxford American</i>, and <i>Juked</i>. In addition to publishing short fiction, book reviews, and interviews, Pence’s critical essay on Dickinson: “Many White Dresses: Emily Dickinson &amp; Her Biographers” was featured in <i>The Writer’s Chronicle</i>. She received her M.F.A. in Creative Writing from the University of Arizona, and grew up in New Orleans and Las Vegas. She now lives in Pine Lake, Georgia.</p>
<p>The <strong>$3,000.00</strong> to be raised here will support <i>[It] Incandescent's </i>design and printing. </p>
<p>This is our third crowd-funding campaign — our most recent helped us publish Patrik Sampler's timely and surreal novel <i>The Ocean Container</i>. We are so thankful for your support and enthusiasm, and can't wait to see more of it for Amy Pence's fantastic new book! </p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>For any small literary press, distribution is a challenge. You can help us get the word out about <i>[It] Incandescent </i>and Ninebark Press; all Ninebark books are available from our website, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Amazon.</p>

<h3><i><strong>Why “ninebark”? </strong></i></h3>
<p>The press takes its name from a genus of flowering bushes, Ninebark, itself named for the way its bark peels away in many layers. Ninebark occurs naturally both within and without the United States in many diverse and varied species. Both as natural object and as word, Ninebark suggests that complexity is not antithetical to beauty, but necessary to its creation. </p>

<p><i><strong>The Ocean Container </strong></i>by Patrik Sampler<br/>In Patrik Sampler's surreal and lyric novel <i>The Ocean Container</i>, an environmentalist accused by a North American petro-state of “economic terrorism” takes refuge in a compound for vagrants. Surrounded by a variety of social and political outcasts—dubious charity providers, a spiritual healer, a man with two right eyes, contraband exotic species, and a theatrical company that may be a front for prostitution—the “terrorist” gradually embraces the exile of his improvised home, a shipping container, where the division between imagination and external reality will irrevocably blur. </p>
<p><i><strong>Stela</strong></i> by Anca Cristofovici<br/>Anca Cristofovici's <i>Stela</i> is the haunting record of the troubled dreamlife and developing creative spirit of a young dancer, Cora, struggling to dispel decades of speculation, half-truths, and informational gaps surrounding the official story of her mother's mysterious disappearance from the streets of an unnamed city in an unnamed country governed by a faceless repressive regime. Thoughtful, inventive, and beautifully lyric, the novel masterfully challenges the persistent, corrupting, too-intimate obfuscations of state terror, its obscure motivations and rolls of the disappeared, with the liberating and illuminating transformations of art. Anca Cristofovici is a Romanian writer currently living in Paris.</p>
<p><strong><i>Armor, Amour</i></strong> by Amy Pence<br/>""Amy Pence's second collection thrives on both contradiction and expansion. Her short works, comprising two-thirds of the poems in the book, fulfill Blake's call for 'Eternity in a grain of sand,' while the longer pieces—rangy, kinetic, meticulously shaped—follow Mallarme's throw of the dice into new and eye-opening frontiers. Pence's poetic world is simultaneously a 'Tender, small universe' and a 'red sac torn open,' and <i>Armor, Amour</i> forcefully captures these conversant facets of her imagination.""</p>
<p>         —Gregory Fraser, author of <i>Answering the Ruins</i></p>
<p><i><strong>Elegy for a Fabulous World</strong> </i>by Alta Ifland<br/>The surreal and darkly humorous stories of <i>Elegy for a Fabulous World</i> describe an eccentric family and their polyglot friends and neighbors—Ukrainians, Hungarians, Germans, Romanians, Gypsies, Jews, Russians—surviving together in a land where fable, reality, and State-issued lies are impossible to untangle. In the book's second section, the narratives emigrate to the United States, where the skepticism learned in fabulous youth infects and frustrates American attitudes and institutions. Real fictions of strange lands, Ifland's stories demonstrate a deep sympathy with the visionary outsider and a vital and provocative international point of view. Alta Ifland grew up in Eastern Europe and emigrated to the United States in 1991. <i>Elegy for a Fabulous World</i> was selected, from an extremely competitive field, as a finalist for the 2010 Northern California Book Awards.</p>
<p><strong><i>Deep Travel: Contemporary American Poets Abroad </i></strong>edited by Sandra Meek<br/><i>Deep Travel</i>, winner of a 2008 Independent Publisher Book Award Gold Medal, brings together thirty-four contemporary American poets whose work has been significantly informed by international travel or by living abroad. The book includes poems by Pulitzer Prize-winners as well as mid-career and emerging writers. Participating poets also contributed original prose statements on how travel has deepened their work, their understanding of poetry's aesthetic and human value, and their sense of self and ""Other.""</p>

<h3>Five Years and Going Strong!</h3>
<p>Three passionate University of Florida journalism students started <a href=""http://www.thefineprintuf.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Fine Print</a> five years ago with a strong belief in the importance of local, independent journalism.  We wanted to provide Gainesville with an independent publication that shed light on environmental, social and political issues here at home -- and we wanted to communicate with readers through good old-fashioned story telling. We also sought to establish an outlet where students could learn skills that weren't being taught in school and put them into practice.</p>
<p>In the past five years, our staff has grown from a handful of students to a thriving volunteer staff. The Fine Print is a labor of love for each of us.  It costs a lot to print our seasonal issues, as well as pay for our working/meeting space and keep our website up and running every day. That's where you can help us keep quality, student journalism alive!</p>
<div>
<h3>The Power of Local Journalism</h3>
<p>Journalism used to be the voice of the people. In its heyday it was a tool to expose injustices in communities and provide routes to correct them. But we're losing our voice in a day when we see more and more big media that tout the mission of big business and government and less local media that speak up for the average person. It's not only a loss to citizens, but it's also a loss to students who aim to become journalists. To preserve our rights, we must preserve local journalism based on its founding principles. And to do that, we must train new journalists who believe in being a voice for the people and provide an outlet that is a true example of just that. In the past five years, The Fine Print has seen real change effected in our community through stories about worker's rights, environmental degradation, unfair policies toward the homeless and more. We've also helped show readers through lifestyle pieces how to live more sustainable lives. You can read all of our past stories on our website at <a href=""http://www.thefineprintuf.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thefineprintuf.org</a>.</p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Fine Print is asking for your financial support to maintain and expand what we can offer our community as well as to the future of journalism at large. We're focusing on three specific goals right now: <br/><br/>1. To keep our working space open over the summer so we can hold workshops to teach new students the skills they need to be successful reporters, writers, graphic designers, editors and community activists. <br/>    - Our working space costs us $371/month plus $43/month for insurance   <br/>      and $30/month for Internet. For the summer months, that equals <br/>      $2,220.<br/><br/>2. The last month of the summer will be dedicated to putting into practice all the skills taught throughout the workshops. The new students will put together a special edition of The Fine Print that they'll distribute to students during the first few weeks of school.<br/>     - The length of the special issue will depend on how much money we <br/>       have for printing. It will likely cost between $700 and $900.</p>
<div>
<p>3. We initially started this campaign hoping that we would be able to raise enough money to finally submit our paperwork to become a 501c3 non-profit. This would have cost about $450. After a lot of thought and consideration and advice from good people in our community, we have decided not to become a 501c3. We even almost completed the extensive paperwork, but because of the IRS requirements, becoming a non-profit would have limited what we can print and do for the community. It would have increased our yearly requirements and paperwork greatly. And in the end, it could have actually increased our chances of failing as an organization down the road. So, because we love our community, our readers, all of the students who we work with and what we are able to provide for everyone, we have decided not to do this. Instead, we will use the final bit of the money we raise to print a bigger fall issue, and what's left, we will save for the upcoming school year and put to work for you then. </p>

<p>I appreciate this opportunity to share my passion with the public! You see, I have a book that <strong>is ready to hit the market,</strong> and I am certain that this book’s message is vitally needed.<strong> I wrote it with a real burden.</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what's wrong with Christianity today? Have you read of the Apostles and their success in ""turning their world upside down"" and wondered why today's disciples don't seem to have any real power or any effective impact on society, which is unravelling at an alarming rate? Though something just doesn't seem right, are you afraid to voice your feelings lest you be found to be speaking against God? Well, in Old Testament times and New, whenever God's people fell short of rightly representing Him, He was the first to speak up. He told the prophets to <strong>cry aloud and spare not</strong>, and to tell His people of their failure to do His will.</p>
<p>I have long been troubled over this ""lack of Christ in Christianity."" Then, a couple of years ago I read some statistics, on the Barna Research web site, that<strong> left me stunned</strong>, and I felt I just <em>had</em> to try to help. Those statistics showed that <em>only 19 percent </em>of modern Christendom’s elite—those who claim to be born-again—actually have a Christian worldview! And, even worse, <em>only 9 percent</em> of the people in general believe in the principles that make up a Christian worldview.</p>
<p>Friend, when only 9 percent of the “world” that <strong>Jesus sent His disciples out to enlighten</strong> believe the fundamental truths of the Gospel, something is radically wrong with what is called Christianity today. But, seriously, how can the “world” believe when <em>less than</em> 2 out of every 10 who claim to be born-again believe their own “message”?

I appreciate this opportunity to share my passion with the public! You see, I have a book that is ready to hit the market, and I am certain that this book’s message is vitally needed. I wrote it with a real burden.
Have you ever wondered what's wrong with Christianity today? Have you read of the Apostles and their success in ""turning their world upside down"" and wondered why today's disciples don't seem to have any real power or any effective impact on society, which is unravelling at an alarming rate? Though something just doesn't seem right, are you afraid to voice your feelings lest you be found to be speaking against God? Well, in Old Testament times and New, whenever God's people fell short of rightly representing Him, He was the first to speak up. He told the prophets to cry aloud and spare not, and to tell His people of their failure to do His will.
I have long been troubled over this ""lack of Christ in Christianity."" Then, a couple of years ago I read some statistics, on the Barna Research web site, that left me stunned, and I felt I just had to try to help. Those statistics showed that only 19 percent of modern Christendom’s elite—those who claim to be born-again—actually have a Christian worldview! And, even worse, only 9 percent of the people in general believe in the principles that make up a Christian worldview.
Friend, when only 9 percent of the “world” that Jesus sent His disciples out to enlighten believe the fundamental truths of the Gospel, something is radically wrong with what is called Christianity today. But, seriously, how can the “world” believe when less than 2 out of every 10 who claim to be born-again believe their own “message”? Unfortunately, these statistics show that many “believers” are trusting in the wrong thing!
I became so burdened about this dilemma that I could no longer hold my peace! I decided to jump right in the middle of the chaos and cry, ""Hold everything, folks! It's time to stop playing charades under the cloak of Christianity! It's time to tell the world the real Gospel message!""
My book was written to do just that! It examines how far modern “Christianity” has gotten off the Scriptural blueprint and what believers can do to get back on track.
My credentials for being able to write this book are that I’ve been a Christian for most of my life, and I’ve observed the decline in Christendom first hand.

<p>The result, announced on the morning of Friday September 19th, showed a majority had rejected the proposition by 55% to 45%.</p>
<p>The outcome of the vote was clear and ensured Scotland continued to be governed from Westminster.  But was it fair?</p>
<p>There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that the British Broadcasting Corporation played a significant role in persuading just enough people to reject independence.  However to date, there has been no appetite from those within our traditional media or political classes to expose what amounted to state sponsored corruption of the democratic process. <br/></p>
<p>This book - <i>How The BBC Stole The Referendum</i> - will reveal how the BBC, both north and south of the border, was used in order to influence the outcome of the independence referendum.  It will chronicle the BBC's behaviour during the final two weeks of the campaign as well as it's role throughout the period from the moment a referendum was guaranteed.  <br/></p>
<p>The two weeks prior to the referendum witnessed the BBC conduct a campaign of deception that was aimed at persuading Scottish voters into believing Devo Max was on offer should No prevail in the referendum debate.  The corporation provided unprecedented access to its airwaves and online news facilities, to a backbench Labour MP called Gordon Brown.  The move would be key in turning a lead for the Yes campaign into a referendum win for No.</p>
<p>On the day this appeal went live, Saturday November 29th, the BBC was again broadcasting a pro-Union speech by Gordon Brown.<br/></p>
<p>The story of the BBC's manifestation into a de-facto pro-Union political party is a story that needs to be told, but one that won't unless we tell it ourselves.</p>
<p>The book will track the deterioration of the BBC from the weeks leading up to the SNP's dramatic win in the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary Elections up until the days following the referendum.<br/></p>
<p>This appeal seeks to raise funds in order to ensure that the book can be published and promoted.  The initial target is modest, but will guarantee a small print run.  Should that print run be a success then profits will be used in order to extend the run.</p>
<p>A publisher will be sought, but due to the controversial subject matter one may not be found.  Thus, the fundraiser will be key to ensuring the book becomes a reality.  The book will articluate the views of the hundreds of thousands of people angry, frustrated yet unheard as traditional media outlets ignore them.<br/></p>
<p>The book will be written by GA Ponsonby who was part of the Newsnet Scotland team of writers.  GA played a key role in highlighting some of the more questionable practices employed by the BBC in its coverage of Scottish politics.</p>
<p>This crowdfunding appeal offered only one perk to those donating.  Chapters one and two to be sent via email to anyone donating a minimum of five pounds.  <br/></p>
<p>With the appeal having reached ninety per cent of its goal it has been decided to publish both chapters on the companion site  <a href=""http://ponsonbypost.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ponsonbypost.com</a>.<br/></p>

<h3>Returning News Reporting to Old School Roots</h3>
<p>A group of former newspaper reporters and government Intel agents formed True Pundit before the 2016 presidential election as a viable alternative to the tainted news coming from the corrupted mainstream media. In its first year, True Pundit has broken dozens of national scandals and big stories all working on a shoe string budget -- employing old and beat up PCs and computer servers seemingly held together with duct tape. <br/><br/><strong>Time and time again True Pundit has scooped Big Media on national stories weeks and months before the crooked corporate media.</strong><br/><br/>Now it is time to help give the True Pundit news start up the proper footing and funding required to help it become even bigger and better. If you are already a reader and believer in True Pundit's Old School approach to Making Journalism Great Again, we ask for your sponsorship. <br/><br/>Unlike other Right media, True Pundit enjoys award-winning journalists on staff and true pros conducting political recon and gathering Intel. Accolades include a Gerald Loeb Award,  Deadline Awards and Pulitzer Prize nominations.<br/><br/>To continue to produce this throw-back journalism, we need your help. Great journalism needs great readers who are ready to support the type of journalism folks just can't find anywhere else.</p>

<h2>The Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>The Business Behind Beauty</i> is a book that explores the intersections of entrepreneurship, the beauty industry, and consumerism. Through a narrative style of writing, I share stories from the perspective of visionary founders who have built companies that deeply resonate with Generation Z and Millennial consumers.<br/><br/>I wrote this book because I believe that there is so much that we can learn from studying beauty entrepreneurs. These founders are navigating a constantly evolving landscape that is increasingly permeating the daily lives of young people. As a veteran lover of the beauty industry, I have witnessed how social media has united millions of Generation Z and Millennial beauty enthusiasts. Digital platforms have enabled young consumers to communicate directly with companies, voice their shared desires, and push the industry toward a fundamental transformation.<br/><br/>In the midst of this evolution of beauty, entrepreneurs have found success by embracing the dynamism of these youths. They have heard the calls for change and have responded by building startup companies that prioritize inclusivity, environmental sustainability, transparency, ethical values, and innovative branding. As a result, these founders are tapping into the hearts and wallets of young consumers and setting a new standard for the future.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the power that consumers and entrepreneurs have to revolutionize industries. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for innovative startups in the beauty space. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better understand shifting desires of consumers, the efforts of entrepreneurs to respond to them, and how startups are challenging traditional conglomerates that are struggling to keep up.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about trailblazing companies such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fenty Beauty</li>
<li>The Ordinary</li>
<li>Kylie Cosmetics</li>
<li>Glossier</li>
<li>And many more...</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A consumer who wants to understand the behind-the-scenes business methods behind your favorite companies</li>
<li>An entrepreneur who desires to learn lessons from successful startups navigating uncharted territory</li>
<li>A marketer who needs advice on how to create the kind of reciprocal relationship that young consumers seek</li>
<li>A corporate executive who wants an insider’s perspective of what is important to Generation Z and Millennials</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The Business of Beauty is for <strong>everybody</strong> who is curious about the joint effort between two generations to revolutionize a behemoth industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Structure of <i>The Business Behind Beauty</i>
</h2>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains background knowledge of the beauty industry and how it has drastically evolved in the past decade. You will garner an understanding of the current landscape of beauty and how Generation Z and Millennial consumers are interacting with each other and with companies.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> analyzes the selection of startup companies that I believe are paving the way for the future. You will read narrative-based stories about the inception of each company, how each founder has devised specific strategies that appeal to young people, and the effects that each venture has had on the industry. This part is absolutely rich in content and in thought-provoking material from interviews.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> discusses my projections for the future of the beauty industry.

</div></div>","The Story of My Book
The Business Behind Beauty is a book that explores the intersections of entrepreneurship, the beauty industry, and consumerism. Through a narrative style of writing, I share stories from the perspective of visionary founders who have built companies that deeply resonate with Generation Z and Millennial consumers.I wrote this book because I believe that there is so much that we can learn from studying beauty entrepreneurs. These founders are navigating a constantly evolving landscape that is increasingly permeating the daily lives of young people. As a veteran lover of the beauty industry, I have witnessed how social media has united millions of Generation Z and Millennial beauty enthusiasts. Digital platforms have enabled young consumers to communicate directly with companies, voice their shared desires, and push the industry toward a fundamental transformation.In the midst of this evolution of beauty, entrepreneurs have found success by embracing the dynamism of these youths. They have heard the calls for change and have responded by building startup companies that prioritize inclusivity, environmental sustainability, transparency, ethical values, and innovative branding. As a result, these founders are tapping into the hearts and wallets of young consumers and setting a new standard for the future.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the power that consumers and entrepreneurs have to revolutionize industries. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for innovative startups in the beauty space. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better understand shifting desires of consumers, the efforts of entrepreneurs to respond to them, and how startups are challenging traditional conglomerates that are struggling to keep up.In this book, you'll learn about trailblazing companies such as:

Fenty Beauty
The Ordinary
Kylie Cosmetics
Glossier
And many more...

 
You will love this book if you are:

A consumer who wants to understand the behind-the-scenes business methods behind your favorite companies
An entrepreneur who desires to learn lessons from successful startups navigating uncharted territory
A marketer who needs advice on how to create the kind of reciprocal relationship that young consumers seek
A corporate executive who wants an insider’s perspective of what is important to Generation Z and Millennials

 
The Business of Beauty is for everybody who is curious about the joint effort between two generations to revolutionize a behemoth industry.
 
The Structure of The Business Behind Beauty

The book is written in 3 Parts....Part 1 contains background knowledge of the beauty industry and how it has drastically evolved in the past decade. You will garner an understanding of the current landscape of beauty and how Generation Z and Millennial consumers are interacting with each other and with companies.Part 2 analyzes the selection of startup companies that I believe are paving the way for the future. You will read narrative-based stories about the inception of each company, how each founder has devised specific strategies that appeal to young people, and the effects that each venture has had on the industry. This part is absolutely rich in content and in thought-provoking material from interviews.Part 3 discusses my projections for the future of the beauty industry. You will learn about the ultimate mistake that startups must avoid, various challenges to consumerism that are developing, and where beauty innovation is headed.

<h3>A Message from the Author</h3>
<p>My name is Jane Giles, and I’m the author of this book. Many of you already know me as the programmer of the Scala cinema between 1988-1992. Since then I’ve been a film exhibitor, distributor, teacher, journalist and have written several non-fiction film publications. But The Scala is my most ambitious book to date, and the one dearest to my heart.</p>
<p>Since the Scala closed in 1993 I’ve wanted to tell its story in depth, but particularly since having met many of today’s most interesting filmmakers who’ve told me how important the Scala programme was to them. One of the most famous directors in the world today still carries his last Scala membership card in his wallet. Looking at the Scala’s history is more than a nostalgia trip, it helps us understand the backstory of British film and what else was happening during those years and therefore a bit more about who we are today.</p>
<p>Because of the very large page format and the number of images that need to be prepared for printing, this is a very expensive book to produce. No ordinary publisher would touch it with a bargepole because they think it’s a risky niche subject with not enough profit for them. But the Scala was never about making a profit, and I know there are enough people out there who really got it and can help make this dream of a book a reality.</p>

<h3>A Legacy Publication to Treasure</h3>
<p>No one has ever attempted to reproduce an entire set of a single cinema venue's programmes until now, so it’s hard to find anything comparable to this book. But the text has already been written and we have a complete collection of programmes waiting to be scanned along with other rare materials.</p>
<p>For people who knew and loved the Scala, the book will be a great treasure. And it will go into the libraries of colleges and universities to be studied by generations to come.</p>
<p>This book is possible because of Jane’s in-depth knowledge of the subject, her research skills and her personal access to the key protagonists. Meanwhile, as both designer and publisher of the book, Harvey has also worked for free on the project. We believe that our experience as an author and designer/publisher combined with an expert editor and indexer will guarantee the highest quality publication.</p>We believe that the networks of people who went to the Scala - whether it was for Shock Around the Clock, Nightmare Movies, the Jackie Chan Fan Club/Eastern Heroes Sunday matinees, Psychotronic Saturdays, All-Nighters, the Laurel &amp; Hardy Festivals, the Animation days, Eraserhead, John Waters’ films, Pink Narcissus, punk gigs, club nights or a combination of ALL of these – we believe that you are the ones who will find this an essential purchase. But cult movie fans of all ages and in all countries will surely enjoy the story of the Scala, and the unparalleled visual resource of all 178 Scala programmes.<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Book Size Comparison</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Scala book will be the largest ever published by FAB Press</strong></p>
<p>To demonstrate the scope of our ambition, the graphic below compares the Scala book cover next to a big box VHS tape cover and a DVD. At least 400 pages long, the finished book in its slipcase will weigh over 5KG!</p>

<p><i><strong>""The Scala was the dark womb that nurtured our forbidden dreams, the dingy dixie cup strewn transit lounge on the borderlands of the unconscious ... I left some part of me behind there, the ghost of my misspent adolescence huddled in a rude nest of programme notes and sweet papers, lost forever in some all-nighter of the soul where it's always 3am and where there's always another reel to show.""</strong></i> </p>

<h3>Risks, Challenges, Schedule and Exclusivity</h3>
<p>FAB Press is a long established company. We've been publishing books for more than 20 years, self-financing almost every publication. In 2017 FAB Press undertook its first Indiegogo crowdfunding project, successfully delivering on all campaign promises within six months of the campaign end date. Now, for the second time, FAB Press has been presented with a publishing opportunity that is too good to turn down, but is again faced with costs that are far too high to cover independently.</p>
<p>We've asked our printers to quote production costs for the largest page dimensions their bindery can physically cope with so that we can reproduce the Scala programmes in print at the largest realistic feasible dimensions. As we are asking our printers to push their capabilities to their absolute limits, this inevitably means the Scala book is a very expensive production. We need your help so we can perfectly fulfil our vision for this very special once in a lifetime book. Be assured the text of the book is finished and we're going into full production already. Now that we have reached our goal we will do all in our power to make sure the product itself will ship in September this year.</p>

<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help spread the word! Your generosity and enthusiasm in sharing our link with friends, groups, forums and websites, and telling everyone you meet who has an interest in cult movies in general, or the Scala cinema in particular, will make a huge difference. We need each person who may be interested in the history of the Scala Cinema to know about the Collector's Edition in plenty of time so they don't miss out. </p>
<p>Please also remember that you are directly helping to support independent cult movie publishing so we can go on to make more books about the subjects you love in the future; every time you buy a standard trade edition of a FAB Press book from a bookstore or any of the large online retailers instead of direct from FAB Press, you are actually giving your money to them — we get very little in return from such sales, leaving less income for authors and making it very much harder for us to finance future publications. In fact the mark-ups demanded by the major online stores are now at a level that means the only way we can continue to stay in business and keep publishing books at all is due to the kindness of our valued customers who directly support FAB Press by either buying from our website (<a href=""https://www.fabpress.com/scala-cinema-book.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.fabpress.com</a>) or by backing campaigns such as this one.</p>
<p>A massive thank you if you do pledge and join us in making this historically important book about the iconic Scala cinema a reality in the most spectacular high-specification format imaginable.</p>

Since the Scala closed in 1993 I’ve wanted to tell its story in depth, but particularly since having met many of today’s most interesting filmmakers who’ve told me how important the Scala programme was to them. One of the most famous directors in the world today still carries his last Scala membership card in his wallet. Looking at the Scala’s history is more than a nostalgia trip, it helps us understand the backstory of British film and what else was happening during those years and therefore a bit more about who we are today.
Because of the very large page format and the number of images that need to be prepared for printing, this is a very expensive book to produce. No ordinary publisher would touch it with a bargepole because they think it’s a risky niche subject with not enough profit for them. But the Scala was never about making a profit, and I know there are enough people out there who really got it and can help make this dream of a book a reality.

""The Scala was perverse in every sense of the word. It made sleaze romantic. That cinema was a refuge from suburbia. It made me feel as if I wasn’t the only misfit in the world.""

A Legacy Publication to Treasure
No one has ever attempted to reproduce an entire set of a single cinema venue's programmes until now, so it’s hard to find anything comparable to this book. But the text has already been written and we have a complete collection of programmes waiting to be scanned along with other rare materials.
For people who knew and loved the Scala, the book will be a great treasure. And it will go into the libraries of colleges and universities to be studied by generations to come.
This book is possible because of Jane’s in-depth knowledge of the subject, her research skills and her personal access to the key protagonists. Meanwhile, as both designer and publisher of the book, Harvey has also worked for free on the project. We believe that our experience as an author and designer/publisher combined with an expert editor and indexer will guarantee the highest quality publication.We believe that the networks of people who went to the Scala - whether it was for Shock Around the Clock, Nightmare Movies, the Jackie Chan Fan Club/Eastern Heroes Sunday matinees, Psychotronic Saturdays, All-Nighters, the Laurel & Hardy Festivals, the Animation days, Eraserhead, John Waters’ films, Pink Narcissus, punk gigs, club nights or a combination of ALL of these – we believe that you are the ones who will find this an essential purchase. But cult movie fans of all ages and in all countries will surely enjoy the story of the Scala, and the unparalleled visual resource of all 178 Scala programmes. 
Book Size Comparison
The Scala book will be the largest ever published by FAB Press
To demonstrate the scope of our ambition, the graphic below compares the Scala book cover next to a big box VHS tape cover and a DVD. At least 400 pages long, the finished book in its slipcase will weigh over 5KG!


 
""The Scala was the dark womb that nurtured our forbidden dreams, the dingy dixie cup strewn transit lounge on the borderlands of the unconscious ... I left some part of me behind there, the ghost of my misspent adolescence huddled in a rude nest of programme notes and sweet papers, lost forever in some all-nighter of the soul where it's always 3am and where there's always another reel to show."" 
~ Richard Stanley.

“The Scala was a place for people who genuinely didn’t fit in anywhere, no longer expected to, and weren’t fussed about it. There was a real ecology to the mix of earnest cinephiles, late-night hedonists, local flotsam and non-specific weirdos.” 
~ Danny Leigh


 
Risks, Challenges, Schedule and Exclusivity
FAB Press is a long established company. We've been publishing books for more than 20 years, self-financing almost every publication. In 2017 FAB Press undertook its first Indiegogo crowdfunding project, successfully delivering on all campaign promises within six months of the campaign end date. Now, for the second time, FAB Press has been presented with a publishing opportunity that is too good to turn down, but is again faced with costs that are far too high to cover independently.
We've asked our printers to quote production costs for the largest page dimensions their bindery can physically cope with so that we can reproduce the Scala programmes in print at the largest realistic feasible dimensions. As we are asking our printers to push their capabilities to their absolute limits, this inevitably means the Scala book is a very expensive production. We need your help so we can perfectly fulfil our vision for this very special once in a lifetime book. Be assured the text of the book is finished and we're going into full production already. Now that we have reached our goal we will do all in our power to make sure the product itself will ship in September this year.
 

How You Can Help
Please help spread the word! Your generosity and enthusiasm in sharing our link with friends, groups, forums and websites, and telling everyone you meet who has an interest in cult movies in general, or the Scala cinema in particular, will make a huge difference. We need each person who may be interested in the history of the Scala Cinema to know about the Collector's Edition in plenty of time so they don't miss out. 
Please also remember that you are directly helping to support independent cult movie publishing so we can go on to make more books about the subjects you love in the future; every time you buy a standard trade edition of a FAB Press book from a bookstore or any of the large online retailers instead of direct from FAB Press, you are actually giving your money to them — we get very little in return from such sales, leaving less income for authors and making it very much harder for us to finance future publications. In fact the mark-ups demanded by the major online stores are now at a level that means the only way we can continue to stay in business and keep publishing books at all is due to the kindness of our valued customers who directly support FAB Press by either buying from our website (www.fabpress.com) or by backing campaigns such as this one.
A massive thank you if you do pledge and join us in making this historically important book about the iconic Scala cinema a reality in the most spectacular high-specification format imaginable.

Esto, sorprendentemente, incluye a personas con esposos Americanos. <em>Amor and Exile</em> es un libro por Nathaniel Hoffman, periodista, y Nicole Salgado, una mujer Americana que tuvo que salir de su propio país para quedar con su esposo Mexicano, quien, debido a leyes proveniente de la época de los 1990’s, no pudo estar legalmente en los Estados Unidos.</p>

Amor and Exile is the story of American citizens—including Veronica, Ben, J.W., and Nicole—who fall in love with undocumented immigrants only to find themselves trapped in a legal labyrinth, stymied by their country’s de facto exclusion of their partners.
Journalist Nathaniel Hoffman visited both sides of the border to document the lives of these couples caught in the crossfire of America’s high stakes political fight over immigration. In his disarming and precise style, Hoffman also traces the historical relationship between immigration, love and marriage. Lending an authentic voice to Amor and Exile, coauthor Nicole Salgado delivers a searing first-person account of life in the U.S. with her husband while he was undocumented, her tortured decision to leave the country with him, and their seven years of exile and starting over together in Mexico.
Amor and Exile tells of love that transcends borders—a story shared by hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens—cutting through the immigration debate rhetoric and providing a courageous perspective for one of the most vexing policy problems of our time.

As the first book to explain the true impact of immigration law on American citizens with undocumented spouses, including same-sex, binational couples—combining deep journalism and first-person narrative—Amor and Exile is uniquely poised to bring new light to a frequently dehumanizing political debate.
Congress needs to hear the stories in Amor and Exile. We are raising funds on Indiegogo to send a copy of Amor and Exile to every member of Congress. With a $20 contribution, we will send a copy of the book to one senator or member of Congress and a personal note about your hopes for immigration reform to any member of Congress you choose. Visit http://amorandexile.com to find your senators and representatives.
We need to raise $11,000 by the end of May in order to deliver these books to Washington in a timely manner.
Reaching our campaign goal will provide us with sufficient funds to print an initial run of Amor and Exile and send 535 copies of the book to Congress along with your personal notes. Any additional funds will help offset the costs we've already incurred in producing this book including:

Nathaniel's monthlong reporting trip to Mexico and trips to Colorado and Texas.
Professional cover design and copy editing.
Self-publishing costs including setting up our new imprint, Cordillera West Books.
 An efficient, low-cost plan to promote and market the book across the United States and Central Mexico.
A portion of future proceeds beyond our campaign goal will be donated to immigration advocacy groups.
What Else You Can Do: 
We believe it is essential to get this book in the hands of our elected representatives right now. But we also know that many of you are eager to get your hands on a copy as well. So for a $50 contribution we will not only send a copy to Congress, but also send you a pre-release signed copy of Amor and Exile. You can review all of the options for supporting the publication of Amor and Exile in the sidebar to the right.*
Whether or not you are able to contribute right now, please share this campaign with your friends and family. It is important that we reach supporters nationwide and internationally, so please let your Facebook and Twitter friends in every state and worldwide know about Amor and Exile!
More Critical Acclaim for Amor and Exile
""A mesmerizing, important look at some of the most overlooked people in the immigration debate—U.S. citizens who follow their deported loved ones into an agonizing exile... Amor and Exile deserves a wide readership.""
—Ellin Jimmerson, Ph.D., historian, theologian and writer/director of “The Second Cooler,” an award-winning migrant justice documentary, narrated by Martin Sheen
“Amor and Exile is a highly gripping, personal and accurate account of the tragedies of our current immigration system, especially as they impact American families. It is particularly timely given Congress’ current focus on immigration reform.”
—Michael Davis, immigration attorney, Chair of USCIS International Operations Liaison Committee and Co-Editor, The Consular Practice Handbook

Resumen en español
Amig@s: Desde 1996, nuestros legisladores han aprobado leyes migratorios mas y mas estrictas, para excluir a la gente de pocos recursos. A pesar de estos leyes, el ingreso de migrantes no ha cesado, resulta que la cantidad de gente indocumentada se ha disparado. Esto, sorprendentemente, incluye a personas con esposos Americanos. Amor and Exile es un libro por Nathaniel Hoffman, periodista, y Nicole Salgado, una mujer Americana que tuvo que salir de su propio país para quedar con su esposo Mexicano, quien, debido a leyes proveniente de la época de los 1990’s, no pudo estar legalmente en los Estados Unidos.
Amor and Exile intenta informar al publico y al gobierno Estadounidense de este problema y ofrecer una nueva perspectiva para llegar a una solución. En su campaña inicial de la auto publicación de su libro, buscan mandar 535 copias del libro a Washington, D.C.—una copia para cada miembro de las dos Cámaras de Representantes y Senadores. Es un momento crítica en la historia de los EEUU porque en hoy día los legisladores en Washington están debatiendo la posibilidad de la reforma migratoria. Tenemos una oportunidad de influir la política gubernamental hacia mas reunificación familiar y una política migratoria mas justa, en vez de mas leyes que criminalizan los migrantes. Tu contribución, sin importar la cantidad, nos apoyaría hacer nuestra visión una realidad y ayudaría lograr una mejor calidad de vida para futuros migrantes. También agradeceríamos su ayuda en compartir nuestra campaña con sus amig@s a través de Facebook, Twitter, y otros medios!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Great Cutting Edge Vampire SF for Charity!</h3>
<p><span>I'm Robert S. Wilson, author of the Empire of Blood dystopian vampire books and one of three editors from the Horror for Good Charitable Anthology series. I've been planning on editing an anthology on my own for a while now. In fact, the first idea that came to mind was a cutting edge dark vampire anthology. </span></p>
<p><span>In the time since my fiction has been on the market, I've found a lot of friends online. One of these friends has a daughter with Cystic Fibrosis. This friend has been one of the biggest supporters of my fiction and I would like to repay her by giving to the very foundation that is helping her daughter in so many great ways: The Cystic Fibrosis Trust, a UK-based charity that assists those suffering with CF.</span></p>
<p>Imagine, if you will, a collection of stories that represent the most cutting edge science fiction-based vampire fiction. Think SF-based vampire fiction like I Am Legend and Necroscope and how they affected the vampire genre when first released. Dark Vampire SF that goes where the genre hasn't before. That is what I want to aspire to for this anthology.</p>
<p>Submissions will open October 1st and close at midnight Pacific Time October 31st, Halloween night. Unpublished stories only. Full fledged horror is welcome but each story must have a strong science fiction element at its core. 1,500 to 10,000 words with a preference in the 1,500 to 5,000 range. Payment upon publication will be an author copy and at least a token payment. Final author payment will be based on how much money is raised from this Indiegogo project. So please consider donating to help me pay the authors for their hard work.</p>

<p>Today college graduates under the age of 25 are faced with daunting statistics, 9.4% of them are unemployed and another 19.1% are in jobs for which they are overqualified.</p>
<p>T. Rowe Price recently published its fourth annual ‘Parents, Kids and Money Survey’ which revealed parents’ financial regrets: not saving enough, being in debt, and starting to save too late.  Teaching kids to save more, start early and control debt will help them avoid their parents’ mistakes. </p>
<p>Studies have shown that parents have the greatest influence on their children’s financial habits.  However, taking the primary role in educating their children about healthy money management can be a daunting task, especially when they feel ill-prepared to teach the subject.</p>
<p>I remember my parents telling me to study hard, go to college and get a good job - that was the key to success. They were self-employed, but they wanted an easier path for me.  They owned an insurance and real estate agency, but they never talked about mortgages or the value of insurance.  They told me to save money, but made no mention of how, why or what to do with it. The emphasis in my household was on studying hard and going to college as preparation for a good life.</p>
<p>Preparation is key.  Although an “A” student in high school, I set off to college on a scholarship without a real plan or any goals regarding what I wanted to accomplish.  I managed to graduate with a business degree and slightly above average GPA, without really applying myself.  While in college, I didn’t take advantage of the career placement opportunities and I left school with no real plan or idea of what type of career I wanted. </p>
<p>For most of my adult working life, I wanted to be an entrepreneur like my parents.  I researched countless business opportunities, but out of fear, waited until I was almost 40 with a new baby and a substantial mortgage to leave a well-paying job to use all my resources to start my own insurance agency.  I entered this venture with no real plan or established goals except that of not working for someone else.  I was 6 months into the business when I realized I would go broke trying to make the business pay for itself as well as my financial obligations. </p>
<p>My parents, James and Jean, gave solid advice, but it was only a part of the story.  We need to teach our kids more about finances and the various career options that are available, including self-employment and entrepreneurship.  Learning about money early in life is critical to financial success as an adult. </p>
<p>Thus, I have made it my mission to help my son, and other kids avoid the pitfalls of lack of planning, nonexistent goal setting, and poor financial management.  Last year, I established Financial Futures Now, an organization dedicated to educating America’s kids on the basic principles of financial literacy and providing them with the skills to become fiscally responsible adults. In order to reach more parents and children, I have written this book.<strong><br/></strong></p>

The manuscript is now finished and is in the second stage of editing. It has received very good reviews from beta readers so far. Author Jason P. Stadtlander is known for writing creative, innovative, compelling stories. Jason's stories have received wonderful reviews on Amazon.com (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ruins-Mind-Anthology-Jason-Stadtlander/dp/1475148135"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ruins of the Mind on Amazon</a>), Barnes and Noble and GoodReads.com</p>
<p>Without revealing too much of the plot, the story is about an alien race that created humans thousands of years ago but chose to remain concealed. Only now there is an impending threat that could destroy the human species, and the alien race wants to help humans fight off this threat. So for the first time the aliens are making themselves known to humanity. Not all people are willing to accept the aliens at face value, however, which causes serious conflict. The result is a spell-binding story filled with mystery, science fiction, suspense and surprises at every turn.</p>
<p>Although Jason has been writing for more than twenty years, he only recently launched his publishing career. He currently has one book in print (<em>Ruins of the</em> <em>Mind</em>), another finished, and is working on three additional novels, one of which, “The Ter’roc,” is a continuance of a short story from <em>Ruins of the Mind</em>. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>FUNDING BREAKDOWN </strong></h3>
<p>The following must be raised for the book to go to print:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing Costs: $3,300</li>
<li>Cover Design: $1,000</li>
<li>Marketing Internationally: $4,950</li>
</ul><p>Raising the following additional amount for a first-print run would be an ideal scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>First Run Hard Cover Printing Costs (1000 books): $8,555</li>
</ul><p>Any funds raised above the first-print run costs will go toward the Children's Literacy and Publishing Program explained below.</p>
<p>If printings costs can also be covered, that will be icing on the cake, but the primary goal is to cover the editing, cover design and marketing costs as these are essential to make the book a best seller.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>I have been training parents and children on the safe usage of computers and the internet for over a decade. I have also worked with law enforcement and the foster parent program of Massachusetts and am a strong advocate of literacy, not only in the United States but also world-wide. My plan—and heart’s desire—is to begin a literacy program for children here in the United States, eventually going global, that encourages children to write. My goal is to create a program to engage children in writing their own books and assist them in publishing them, paving a path for them to realize their own potential through writing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any funds collected above and beyond the full campaign goals will be put toward this goal for the children.</p>

<p>I appreciate and thank you for your support—in whatever way you choose to help.</p></div>","This fiction novel is a based on an ancient theory of aliens being a part of the creation of the human race. The manuscript is now finished and is in the second stage of editing. It has received very good reviews from beta readers so far. Author Jason P. Stadtlander is known for writing creative, innovative, compelling stories. Jason's stories have received wonderful reviews on Amazon.com (Ruins of the Mind on Amazon), Barnes and Noble and GoodReads.com
Without revealing too much of the plot, the story is about an alien race that created humans thousands of years ago but chose to remain concealed. Only now there is an impending threat that could destroy the human species, and the alien race wants to help humans fight off this threat. So for the first time the aliens are making themselves known to humanity. Not all people are willing to accept the aliens at face value, however, which causes serious conflict. The result is a spell-binding story filled with mystery, science fiction, suspense and surprises at every turn.
Although Jason has been writing for more than twenty years, he only recently launched his publishing career. He currently has one book in print (Ruins of the Mind), another finished, and is working on three additional novels, one of which, “The Ter’roc,” is a continuance of a short story from Ruins of the Mind. 
 
FUNDING BREAKDOWN 
The following must be raised for the book to go to print:

Editing Costs: $3,300
Cover Design: $1,000
Marketing Internationally: $4,950
Raising the following additional amount for a first-print run would be an ideal scenario:

First Run Hard Cover Printing Costs (1000 books): $8,555
Any funds raised above the first-print run costs will go toward the Children's Literacy and Publishing Program explained below.
If printings costs can also be covered, that will be icing on the cake, but the primary goal is to cover the editing, cover design and marketing costs as these are essential to make the book a best seller.
 
 
WHAT YOU GET
 
Digital Human Level ($5.00): digital wallpaper of the cover once it is finished and a thank-you on Jason's author website
Digital Alien Level ($15.00):  everything from Digital Human plus a digital copy of
The Ter'roc: Evolution (Kindle format)
Species Leader ($30.00): everything in the previous levels as well as a signed thank-you letter from Jason
Humanity Leader ($100.00): everything in Species Leader as well as an autographed Hard Cover copy of The Ter'roc: Evolution
Species Hero ($250.00): everything from Humanity Leader level as well as a custom T-Shirt and bookmark

Planetary Hero ($1000.00): everything from Humanity's Hero plus five additional signed books by the author, editor and illustrator and a video Skype conference with Jason, personally thanking you. (If you are located within 200 miles of Boston, Jason will meet with you for lunch instead of the Skype conference)
Solar System Hero: ($2500.00): everything from Planetary Hero plus your name being used as a character in the next book and a personal invitation to Jason's book release party to be held on a beach in Swampscott, Massachusetts, in the summer/fall of 2013.

<p><strong>Recharge your brain vitality! </strong> At any age, we can grow more brain cells and improve their function. This was proven by science in 1998, when Dr. Fred Gage, professor at the Salk Institute, confirmed it in the lab. <em>Physical exercise </em>encourages new brain cell growth and vitality (also proven by Gage).</p>
<p><strong>What's in the book?</strong>  Three sections: The Exercise Program, Lifestyles for Happy Brains, and Resources. About 30 percent of the exercises involve crossing your midline, to trigger left/right brain communication. (Get an explanation of how “crossover exercise” works, below.)  Many of them can be done in a chair. The remainder are breathing exercises, balancing postures (holding a support is optional), finger exercises and eye movements. Tons of photos are included with explanations. Readers choose from a variety of exercises, to suit their needs. A few ""quick tune-ups"" and suggested 10-15 minute workouts are provided.</p>
<p>The <em>Lifestyles for Happy Brains</em> section includes brain benefits of aerobic exercise, nutrition, smiling / laughing, breathing well, relaxation, sleep, and drinking enough water. Harmful effects of cortisol (the stress hormone) on your brain are mentioned, with notes on keeping stress at bay. How to practice breath awareness for meditation is shared.</p>
<p>The 3<sup>rd</sup> section, <em>Resources,</em> shows you where to find related information, neuroscience news, and brain fitness activities near you.</p>
<p><strong>Who needs it ?</strong> Anyone wanting to ""switch the brain on"" to refresh energy and alertness, improve memory and focus. Some of the exercises bring calmness, a sense of balance and stress relief. ""Balance"" refers to both your mental state AND physical ability to balance, a helpful thing for older persons concerned about falling. </p>
<p><strong>Why me, why now?</strong> After 30 years of writing/ teaching on health and fitness, I started Brain Vitality seminars last year, and they've been well received. Participants encouraged me to make a book or DVD of the exercises. I decided to start with a book, and it's 70 percent done. For more about me, read my profile by clicking on my name, below.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing the tools.  Your contribution will bring Brain Vitality information to many people.  </strong>The exercises help reduce stress, enhance energy and focus. For children with attention disorders, and for athletes, they've improved concentration. (Documented in <em>“Smart Moves”</em> by Carla Hannaford, Ph.D.)</p>
<p>I am scheduled to give some free seminars and books to Veterans clinics and a mental health center, for the counselors, as well as clients. With the rise of PTSD and suicides in the military, and my personal experiences with anxiety and depression, I want to share this useful tool. If the campaign is over-funded, I will provide more free books and seminars to human service providers and their clients.

<p><strong>About “crossover” exercises:</strong>  These movements cross your body’s midline with arms or legs, like touching left knee with right hand, then right knee with left hand, several times. Repeated crossover moves activate large areas of both sides of your brain, simultaneously. This involves the corpus callosum, a bundle of nerve fibers connecting left and right brain hemispheres. The corpus callosum processes information and is active in problem solving and creativity. Regular practice of crossing midline causes more nerve cells and networks to form in the corpus callosum. This makes communication between sides of the brain faster and more integrated for high-level reasoning, writes Carla Hannaford, Ph.D., in <em>Smart Moves.<br/><br/></em><strong>Thanks for the Project Video:</strong></p>

The Impact


There are tens of millions of people with close family
members who are alcoholics or mentally ill. I want to share my
experiences with them in the hope that they might gain a bit of understanding and encouragement. 

There are many online support groups that, had the internet been around when I was growing up, would have been a great source of emotional support.

The Proposal

After I finished the novel, I thought about setting out to get an agent and someone to publish it,
but decided against it. The inevitable result of asking various people to market your book for you is that your work then becomes a collaboration. I felt, at least for this book, I would be happier if it remained my own.
What I really wanted was for my book to be read by as many people as
possible.
 
A few weeks ago I came across an
article about two authors, one who was unpublished and one who was already a
successful novelist. Both writers decided to self-publish some of their works through Kindle and sell them for a nominal amount. This turned out to be a great success for both authors, in that lots and lots of people purchased and read
their books. And I thought to myself: Here it is – I’ve found my solution.
 
I’m asking for $6,000 so I can get my (currently 350 page) book professionally edited, get a cover
designed and put my book up for sale on Kindle in both the US and UK. I’d also
like to get a basic website built so I can respond to people’s questions and comments. Finally, I'd like to get a small number of printed copies made. Those of you who donate a certain amount (see the perks section) will receive a signed copy.
 If I don't reach my goal, I will get to the stage that funds will allow (e.g., the first $2,000 will go to my editor, etc.) and come up with a Plan B or C to get the rest of the funds. I've come so far that the project has to happen. It will just take me longer.

If I exceed my goal, the extra money will go toward promotion and/or costs associated with other distribution methods.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Furthermore, <i>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i> is highly <b>applicable to the Haitian context</b>. You might wonder if the witch's curse (""always winter and never Christmas"") will have any meaning on a tropical island. It will, undoubtedly, strike a different chord in Haiti than it did to me when I read it as a young Canadian. But the story contains many elements which will resonate with a Haitian cultural consciousness. There is a tyrannical ruler, complete with her own secret police, who is overthrown by a revolution (quite in keeping with Haitian history); there are talking animals and magic spells (both common in Haitian folklore); and yes, there is religion. Lewis was a Christian apologist, who nevertheless drew liberally from Greek and Roman mythology in his writing. Narnia is constructed around a Christian paradigm, but at the same time is rife with fauns, naiads, dryads and other semi-divine spirits of the ancient world. Both Christianity and animism have an important place in the Haitian culture. As such, the world and imagery of Narnia will resonate with the Haitian reader. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With its gripping story, sympathetic characters and cultural relevance, <i>Lyon an, Lougawou a, ak Amwa majik la</i> will be a valuable addition to the corpus of Creole literature, and a useful contribution to the fight against illiteracy.<br/></p>

You might wonder if the witch's curse (""always winter and never Christmas"") will have any meaning on a tropical island. It will, undoubtedly, strike a different chord in Haiti than it did to me when I read it as a young Canadian. But the story contains many elements which will resonate with a Haitian cultural consciousness. There is a tyrannical ruler, complete with her own secret police, who is overthrown by a revolution (quite in keeping with Haitian history); there are talking animals and magic spells (both common in Haitian folklore); and yes, there is religion. Lewis was a Christian apologist, who nevertheless drew liberally from Greek and Roman mythology in his writing. Narnia is constructed around a Christian paradigm, but at the same time is rife with fauns, naiads, dryads and other semi-divine spirits of the ancient world. Both Christianity and animism have an important place in the Haitian culture. As such, the world and imagery of Narnia will resonate with the Haitian reader. 
With its gripping story, sympathetic characters and cultural relevance, Lyon an, Lougawou a, ak Amwa majik la will be a valuable addition to the corpus of Creole literature, and a useful contribution to the fight against illiteracy.




   how you can help We've already signed contracts with a publisher. Educa Vision is Florida-based publisher of Creole educational materials and one of the few publishers of world literature in Haitian Creole translation. All that's left is the translation rights. HarperCollins UK oversees rights acquisitions for the Chronicles of Narnia, and they have agreed to sell us the Haitian Creole translation rights. The people at HarperCollins are sympathetic to the particular ""emergent literature"" situation of the Haitian Creole language, and have kindly offered us a fair price to buy the rights. But it's still more than we can afford to pay out of our pockets. The money we raise in this campaign will foot the bill for the translation rights. If we exceed our goal, the remainder will be donated to an NGO which supports education in Haiti. Likewise, royalties on sales will be reinvested into Haitian literacy. As a bonus, if you donate more than $50, we'll send you a copy of Romulus, Matt's English translation of a 1908 Haitian novella.

sample

Te gen yon fwa kat timoun ki te rele Pyè, Sizàn, Edmond ak Lwiz. Istwa sa eksplike yon bagay ki te pase, lè yo te fè yo kite vil Lond pandan lagè akòz bombadman yo. Yo te al viv lakay yon gran pwofèse ki abite nan mitan peyi a, a ven kilomèt soti gran chimen an. Pwofèse sa pa t gen yon madanm, e li viv nan yon gwo kay avèk yon menajè ki rele Madan Makredi, epi twa domestik. (Yo rele Ivet, Mari ak Beti, men pesonaj sa yo pa tre enpòtan pou istwa sa). Li menm se te yon moun ki te granmoun anpil tout cheve li yo te blan avèk li te gen anpil lòt ki te boujonnen prèske toupatou nan figi ak tèt li. Timoun yo renmen li prèske touswit; poutan, premyè jou swa a, lè misye te soti lakay li pou l te akeyi yo nan papòt la, li te tèlman gen yon move visaj ke Lwiz (ki te pi jenn lan) te pe li, e Edmond (ki te dezyèm pi jenn lan) te tèlman anvi ri li te oblije fè komsi l ap mouche nen li pou li te kache ri a.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

thirteen year-old girl who desperately needs to read what you have to say. She
needs to read about sex and religion in precisely the way you’re writing about
these subjects in order for her to be happy. The discomfort of those close to
you is far outweighed by the needs of those people you’ll never know, who’ll
only know you by your words. You’re writing to express something that they
themselves cannot express.""</blockquote><p>I took Ryan's words as my mantra and expanded <i>Companion Plants</i>. After years of writing, wringing my hands, and revising, I finished the novel. In the book, a young woman blames her religious upbringing for a friend's suicide and sets out to discover who she is beyond the strict rules of doctrine. Reinventing herself in a new town, she struggles with breaking the taboos of her mother's faith and navigating the lines between friend and lover, child and adult. As she learns new details about events back home, she is forced to reevaluate the childhood she thought she knew.

I am thrilled by the upcoming publication of my novel, both on a personal achievement level and because I will finally be able to reach other people with the story. But, as my book is coming out through an independent press, and with the publishing industry the way it is today, I am entirely responsible for promotion with no financial help from the publisher. This promotion includes a website, advertising (such as a book trailer and promotional bookmarks), supplying the cover art and author photo, and touring/giving readings.</p><p>As a writer who worked a variety of full-time (and then some) jobs to put myself through school and complete my novel, publication with a small press is the chance of a lifetime.

<li>Promotional bookmarks, to be distributed through libraries, stores, and an online bookseller;</li>
<li>Travel across the east coast and, with enough raised funds, the rest of the country to give readings and promote the book, focusing on independent bookstores.</li>
</ul><p>Any money raised beyond the initial goal will allow me to host readings in more cities across the U.S. and reach a wider audience with my novel.<br/></p>Your support will make my dream of being a successful novelist a very real possibility by allowing me to make the most of this opportunity.

In the book, a young woman blames her religious upbringing for a friend's suicide and sets out to discover who she is beyond the strict rules of doctrine. Reinventing herself in a new town, she struggles with breaking the taboos of her mother's faith and navigating the lines between friend and lover, child and adult. As she learns new details about events back home, she is forced to reevaluate the childhood she thought she knew. An excerpt from the novel was published and can be read here: Slush Pile Magazine.Now: this Indiegogo campaign. I am thrilled by the upcoming publication of my novel, both on a personal achievement level and because I will finally be able to reach other people with the story. But, as my book is coming out through an independent press, and with the publishing industry the way it is today, I am entirely responsible for promotion with no financial help from the publisher. This promotion includes a website, advertising (such as a book trailer and promotional bookmarks), supplying the cover art and author photo, and touring/giving readings.As a writer who worked a variety of full-time (and then some) jobs to put myself through school and complete my novel, publication with a small press is the chance of a lifetime. The opportunity to get my name out there and potentially get work picked up by a major publishing house later on. But to maximize this opportunity, I need your help!What I Need & What You GetAll of the money I raise will be put toward promoting my novel. This includes:
Payment for the cover art (photograph of Trinidad cliffs by Krista Sappington);
An author/book website;
A book trailer (my inability to make a video for Indiegogo is an indicator of my need for a professional!);
Promotional bookmarks, to be distributed through libraries, stores, and an online bookseller;
Travel across the east coast and, with enough raised funds, the rest of the country to give readings and promote the book, focusing on independent bookstores.
Any money raised beyond the initial goal will allow me to host readings in more cities across the U.S. and reach a wider audience with my novel.Your support will make my dream of being a successful novelist a very real possibility by allowing me to make the most of this opportunity. Plus, you'll support independent publishers and bookstores in the process. You'll be keeping alive a centuries-old tradition of art patronage. Just call yourself Medici.In return, you will receive:

<p><b><u>PRESENTACIÓN</u></b></p>
<p>Mi nombre es Álex de Sande y soy
profesor de un instituto de secundaria. Al fallecer mis padres tuve la
necesidad de hacer el Camino de Santiago para encontrarme a mí mismo. Al llegar
a Finisterre, al Fin del Mundo, fui consciente de que aquel final era un
inicio. Así empecé una búsqueda interior que me llevó a vivir muchas
experiencias espirituales y a regresar inconscientemente a mis orígenes, el
lugar donde nací: un pueblo del Alto Aragón, en la provincia de Huesca,
concretamente Graus. A las afueras de
la población, escondido en El Valle de La Fueva, en medio de unos bosques mágicos
y atemporales descubrí el Monasterio Budista de Dag Shang Kagyü. Allí realicé
diferentes cursos de meditación budista y compartí dichas experiencias con personas
corrientes, que aprovechando las vacaciones realizaban un retiro espiritual
para encontrarse así mismas. Algunas de ellas, tras despertar la conciencia,
iniciaban un proceso de trasformación de sus vidas, una metamorfosis interior y
exterior. </p>
<p>  Fascinado por la experiencia humana vivida
allí, pude ser testigo de una cautivadora historia de amor que decidí novelar,
en la que los personajes irán redescubriendo un pasado lleno de aventuras por
medio mundo. Y así se suceden las peripecias de un artista ciego que pinta
sueños, monjes que parecen levitar, un cartomántico invidente que ve el futuro,
un tatuador de lotos azules invisibles y un oftalmólogo profesor de yoga que
intenta enseñar a ver con los ojos del corazón. </p>
<p>El relato destila mucha luz, poesía
y espiritualidad. Sin embargo, en bastantes capítulos la ironía y el humor han
conseguido arrancar carcajadas contagiosas a los amigos que ya la han leído. Eso
me complace, porque sé que la risa lleva a la alegría, y esta a gozar de
instantes de felicidad. </p>
<p><b><u>PROYECTO</u></b></p>

<p>De repente, ella se despertó con la angustia de
ahogarse en un mar de sueños frustrados. Con la respiración acelerada se dio
cuenta de que estaba hiperventilando. Empezó a aplicar las técnicas de
relajación que había aprendido en las sesiones preparatorias al parto. Apenas había
descansado unas horas por el disgusto de saber que la academia en la que
trabajaba había cerrado sin previo aviso. Llevaba meses sin cobrar, pero tenía
la esperanza de que algo le ingresaran. Esa ansiedad la empujaba a ir al cajero
automático del banco hasta diez veces en un día. Al reclamar, siempre le daban
nuevas excusas y le pedían más paciencia. Tenía la sensación de estar
hundiéndose en la adversidad sin ninguna esperanza.</p>
<p>El divorcio fue una liberación. No iba a consentir
nunca más las humillaciones ni los maltratos físicos ni psicológicos de ningún
hombre. Con dignidad iba a criar a su hija sin tener que arrastrarse ante
nadie. Por eso, debía sacar fuerzas de flaqueza para resistir y continuar luchando
sin desfallecer. </p>
<p>Las paredes de la habitación y del resto del piso
estaban pintadas de color gris a gusto de su exmarido. Ahora le parecían tan
asfixiantes como los muros de una cárcel y quizá lo eran, porque se sentía
prisionera de una realidad agobiante que no le dejaba salir. Por eso, había
empezado a empapelarlas con folios en blanco, como si fueran ventanitas en las
que escribía frases que le ayudaban a levantar el ánimo y a desahogarse, porque
sabía que el rencor y el odio que se acumula dentro, acaba carcomiendo el alma.
Volvió a leer sus palabras con el coraje, el dolor y la rabia de las mujeres
que nunca se rinden antes de la batalla:</p>
<p><b>“Hay personas que empiezan a morir en vida. Otras están muertas y aún
no lo saben.  La putrefacción es sutil y
rauda. Algunos, al sentir el olor a cadaverina, se embalsaman, pero ya es
tarde, pues empiezan a pudrirse por dentro, siendo el corazón lo primero que
devoran los gusanos”.</b></p>
<p><b><u>CAPÍTULO- 51</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>Como era muy tarde, Max invitó a Lucía a su casa. Y
le dijo: — Ahora si subes despertarás a todos. Es mejor que vengas a mi refugio
secreto. Nunca nadie ha estado antes. Has visto que excusa tan buena tengo para
llevarte al bosque donde los lobos se comen a las caperucitas azules como tú.</p>
<p>— ¡Qué malo que eres...! ¡Jajajaja...! ¡Sí, me has
convencido! — encendieron las linternas y emprendieron el camino de Ejep.
Apenas recorrieron medio kilómetro de pista de gravilla, que se internaron por
un sendero de pinos y maleza. Hasta que él la detuvo y sobre un tronco ladeado
la besó, y le dijo que esperasen hasta habituar los ojos a la oscuridad, pues
era preferible continuar iluminados con la luz de la luna. Díez minutos más
tarde, tras atravesar una espesa cortina de árboles, de repente apareció una
casita de cuento de hadas. Ella no pudo resistir la fascinación que le produjo
y exclamó: — ¡Es mágica...! ¡Está envuelta en una nube de luz azul
fosforescente!</p>
<p>  Al
acercarse, él le explicó que la barraca estaba apoyada sobre una pared de roca
en forma de concha, que daba acceso a una gruta donde habitaban miles de
coleópteros. Cogidos de la mano, la guio adentrándose en la cueva. Los ojos se
fueron adaptando a la oscuridad a medida que la rodobsina estimulaba el nervio
óptico. Ambos se detuvieron en el silencio. Entre ellos solo se intuían por la
respiración. El nictálope de Max animó a Lucía a que levantase la vista.
Entonces, ambos contemplaron fascinados un espectáculo maravilloso: la cúpula
del techo de la caverna se había convertido en la inmensa bóveda del cielo,
donde un enjambre de millones de estrellas no paraba de parpadear. Él, entre
bisbiseos, le explicó: <i>“Lo que estás
viendo es una colonia de luciérnagas, la mayoría son larvas y hembras, que no
utilizan la bioluminiscencia de reclamo sexual, sino como cebo. El espectro de
luz que emiten, cada seis a ocho segundos, va de un débil a un intenso azul y
les sirve para atraer en este caso a las presas. Hacen igual que las arañas:
tejen redes invisibles y hebras pegajosas que despliegan desde el techo como si
fuese un caladero, con las mismas técnicas de los viejos pescadores nocturnos;
a continuación, encienden sus linternas biológicas y emiten destellos intermitentes
que atrae a los incautos insectos, los cuales se acercan encandilados por el
mágico brillo y el titilante reclamo, hasta que caen enredados en la trampa,
igual que muchos mortales ante la belleza. Las víctimas atrapadas intentan
escapar, se revuelven y la vibración de las terminaciones nerviosas de la tela
avisa a las depredadoras de que alguna alelada polilla o mosquito ha vuelto a
caer; es el momento en que izan con cuidado las mallas y los aparejos, algunos
de palangre, recogen las capturas y se las comen. Por</i> <i>eso, alguien, en un rapto de inspiración poética, las bautizó con el
singular nombre de “Las estrellas de la muerte.”</i></p>
<p>Durante veinte minutos observaron extasiados aquel
centelleo hipnótico. Estaban ante un espectáculo único. Lucía, con suma
curiosidad, le preguntó en un susurro: — <i>¿Y
cómo sus cuerpos consiguen generar ese resplandor?</i></p>
<p>La respuesta de Max no se hizo esperar y le musitó al
oído: — <i>La bioluminiscencia es un proceso
químico de oxidación del sustrato de la proteína denominada luciferina,
catalizada por la enzima luciferasa. A ellas se les ilumina el abdomen, y como
su piel está recubierta con una especie de lentes conocidas con el nombre de
cristales de urato, intensifican y multiplican el reflejo de la luz.</i></p>
<p>A ella se le ocurrió quitarse la camiseta y dejar al
descubierto su espalda, y sobre la piel desnuda empezó a iluminarse el dibujo
tatuado del loto azul invisible. Max le recorrió a besos el tallo de la flor
hasta llegar a los pétalos detrás de la nuca, mientras sus dedos le masajeaban
cada uno de sus siete chacras. La abrazó por detrás y le hizo el amor en
silencio. El eco de un profundo gemido de placer recorrió los huecos de roca de
la bóveda celeste, e hizo temblar las estrellas de aquel inmenso cielo
interior.</p>
<p>Salieron con lentitud de aquel viaje onírico. Max la
llevó de la mano hasta su refugio. Entraron a oscuras. Ella se dio cuenta de
que el tejado tenía dos amplías ventanas en el techo, de tal manera que la luz
de la luna iluminaba el interior de la estancia. Subieron por una escalerilla a
un altillo en donde estaba la cama. Agacharon la cabeza para no darse con las
vigas de madera y se metieron entre las sábanas. En la penumbra, él pudo
vislumbrar por el brillo de sus pupilas el centelleo estelar de la cueva. Se
abrazaron y se llenaron la piel de besos y caricias hasta quedarse dormidos el
uno en el otro.</p>
<p>A medianoche, ella vio como Max se ladeaba, cogía una
libreta y completamente inspirado escribía algo. Estuvo un buen rato alumbrado
por el resplandor lunar. Todavía hipnotizada, observó el movimiento de su mano
atrapada en la caligrafía. Había sido un día inolvidable y una noche llena de
magia y de fantasía. </p>
<p>  Antes
de desvanecerse la oscuridad, Lucía se desveló y vio tumbado a los pies el
cuaderno en que él había anotado algo. En la portada, de tapa dura, destacaba
el título: “Diario del Alma”. De la solapa colgaba la pluma que le regaló. No
pudo vencer su vehemente curiosidad y con sigilo se movió para intentar coger
el cuaderno sin que se diera cuenta. Debía deslizarse entre las sábanas con
lentitud para no despertarle. Tampoco podía demorarse demasiado, porque no
debía faltar mucho para que amaneciera. Con cuidado fue alargando el brazo
hasta cogerlo con el temor que no se le resbalase de golpe. Cautelosa lo abrió
y vio que las páginas estaban en blanco. Enseguida, se dio cuenta de que habían
sido escritas con su pluma de tinta invisible. Sacó de su bolso una linternita
de luz ultravioleta, que solía utilizar para revisar las palabras ocultas que utilizaba
para atrapar los deseos que ella antes anotaba, y leyó de la última hoja, el
párrafo final:</p>
<p>  <b>“La visita con ella
a la gruta fue perturbadora, pues nunca había estado dentro con alguien. Fue
como ir por primera vez. Hacía años que no entraba. A nadie le había revelado
aquel lugar secreto. Me ha evocado lejanos recuerdos de la infancia, cuando me
escapaba de aventuras por las cuevas de la Virgen de La Peña en Graus. A medida
que avanzábamos hacia la oscuridad, esta se hacía más densa, tangible y
misteriosa. Nos detuvimos en la enorme bóveda y tuve la sensación de estar en
el interior de un útero excavado en las entrañas de la tierra, donde una
luminosidad extraña, biológica, emitida principalmente por los cuerpos de miles
de luciérnagas hembras, apareadas en época de reproducción y que albergaban en
sus entrañas docenas de huevos de nuevas crías, inundaban la atmósfera de una
lucífera metamorfosis. Por las paredes del techo del cielo, corría la savia
azul de las estrellas, tan embrionaria y emergente que se colaba por las venas
pétreas de la caverna hasta hacerla latir en una continua gestación, a la
espera de que las miles de vidas que llevaban las rocas dentro, despertasen de
su sueño mineral, igual que nosotros.”</b></p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Half the Battle</i> is about a young basketball player who suddenly faces the loss of her parents and must learn to navigate her new reality while in the midst of a league championship—an opportunity to continue her mothers legacy and escape from the towns sorrows.<br/><br/>My name is Ashley Alvarez and I am the author of <i>Half the Battl</i><i>e</i>. I wrote this book because as a young athlete, I struggled with mental health and while I had a ton of people helping me optimize my physical health, nobody taught me how to be mentally healthy.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that mental health is just as important as physical health in athletes and that athletes can struggle with the same emotions everyone else does. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn alongside Thora, the protagonist, about the importance of prioritizing our well-being to reach our full potential as athletes and as people.</p>
<p>In this book, Thora Martinez and her family are living in a new reality after the passing of her parents. Now, grieving and amid a league championship, Thora and her family must manage their well-being but constantly face setbacks that challenge their individuality and family.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are an athlete, former athlete, coach, and mental health advocate.<br/><br/><i>Half the Battle</i> speaks to young adults and athletes who want to grapple with their mental well-being and grief.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Half the Battle</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>How far are athletes willing to go to achieve success? And at what cost?</li>
<li>Are there ways we can normalize and prioritize mental health through all athletic departments?</li>
<li>What are the long-term consequences of ignoring mental health?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing mental health and grief will change us all for the better.</p>

Half the Battle is about a young basketball player who suddenly faces the loss of her parents and must learn to navigate her new reality while in the midst of a league championship—an opportunity to continue her mothers legacy and escape from the towns sorrows.My name is Ashley Alvarez and I am the author of Half the Battle. I wrote this book because as a young athlete, I struggled with mental health and while I had a ton of people helping me optimize my physical health, nobody taught me how to be mentally healthy.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that mental health is just as important as physical health in athletes and that athletes can struggle with the same emotions everyone else does. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn alongside Thora, the protagonist, about the importance of prioritizing our well-being to reach our full potential as athletes and as people.
In this book, Thora Martinez and her family are living in a new reality after the passing of her parents. Now, grieving and amid a league championship, Thora and her family must manage their well-being but constantly face setbacks that challenge their individuality and family.
You will love this book if you are an athlete, former athlete, coach, and mental health advocate.Half the Battle speaks to young adults and athletes who want to grapple with their mental well-being and grief.Ultimately, I hope that Half the Battle inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:
 

How far are athletes willing to go to achieve success? And at what cost?
Are there ways we can normalize and prioritize mental health through all athletic departments?
What are the long-term consequences of ignoring mental health?

 
I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing mental health and grief will change us all for the better.
 

What We Need & What You Get
This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:
 

The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August, 2021.
The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)
The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Summer.

 
When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition.
I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:
 

You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.
Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

<p><i>A broadcast journalist gets pulled into the private  </i><i>and criminal world of a popular entertainer.</i></p>
<b>        </b><p></p>
<p>When Judy Pierce, a veteran broadcast news anchor in the budding entertainment center of Atlanta, decides to join a celebrity gossip web site in addition to her cable network job, she lands a major interview with volatile superstar, Shawn Blake, and the embattled entertainer invites her into a reckless and unfiltered world that changes her life and career for the worst.</p>
<p>Rumored of having gang and drug affiliations, domestic violence issues, multiple child support cases and several murder charges, all while being viewed as Hollywood’s next Denzel Washington, Shawn Blake is all that he’s rumored to be—a real bad ass.

<p>But when Judy gets too involved in his “all access” invitations, the fall-out of rumors and social media assaults begin to unravel her own household, family and job security. With a six-figure income, a dedicated husband, a solid reputation, and two children in grade school, Judy has far too much at stake to lose.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, once she enters Shawn’s volatile world of real crime, desperate associations and public slander, she finds herself wishing she had never met the man, while fighting to regain her sanity and protect her life and family, who find themselves in imminent danger when she’s called to testify against the star in court.</p>

detoxification specialist, though you may not know it to look at her.  Six years ago, we watched as her health deteriorated, dragging her down into disease and despair.  In a shockingly short enough time, her symptoms and conditions overwhelmed her body and mind.  <br/><br/>Today she suffers from debilitating panic disorder and agoraphobia, moderate to severe lung disease (COPD), OCD, depression, GI Tract disorders, obesity, and Systemic Candida – to name just a few.  In the midst of the storm, Teresa wandered off her wellness path and to watch someone you love literally slip away like that, is a most painful trial that our family has to go through.<br/><br/><b>Though many days the path back to wellness feels like an insurmountable feat, we watch every day as Teresa perseveres, determined to live out the life of service that she always felt destined for.</b>  Any other person would be justified in giving in if they had to cope with the obstacles that our sister faces every day of her life.  But Teresa will never give up.  She will also never ask for help, which is why we have taken it upon ourselves to ask for her. <br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/681583/files/20140628201107-aaa.png?1404011467"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><b>Teresa is full of amazing plans for the future and we are dedicated to giving her as much love and support as possible in order to help her come back to herself and back to her life's mission.</b><br/><br/>After the onset of her serious mental conditions, Teresa took advantage of the time she's forced to spend at home and studied to become a natural health counselor.  Her goal was never to keep these natural healing solutions to herself – her goal was to become an inspiration to others.<br/><br/>Unable to implement the program herself, her health continued to crumble before her eyes.  Consequently, <b>her life's mission took on another layer of depth</b>.  Now, she is called to heal herself first and lead others by her example.  Though experiencing disease first-hand was never exactly the career path our sister had intended, <b>she is grateful to be able to authentically relate to people facing critical health concerns and chronic disease</b>.<br/><br/>With over a decade of experience in the natural health arena, Teresa has learned that the human body always tends towards balance, health, and wellness.  Teresa also believes that nothing in nature functions in isolation and that there is synergy and community everywhere we look: intricate ecosystems that support innumerable life forms, mental health that gives way to physical prosperity, and even forums such as this – where people come together to support worthy causes.  <br/><br/><b>Her dream is to bring nature back to healing and to chronicle her journey back to health</b> in an authentic and un-censored way, and by doing so will inspire others to find their way back as well.<br/><br/><p><i>(You can read more about Teresa's health challenges, her dreams and more on her <a href=""http://botanicalhealthclub.com/about-me"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">About Me</a> page on her website:  BotanicalHealthClub.com)</i><br/></p><br/><p></p><h2><strong><p style=""background-color: #9FF899;"">The Goal</p></strong></h2> Few natural health counselors suddenly find themselves on the wrong side of the wellness tracks – but that is exactly where Teresa wound up.  <b>Given her unique background and knowledge of the body’s natural healing processes, she has the opportunity to lead others by her own example.  Her goal is to become the proof</b> – to turn herself into a natural healing success story and to, in turn, inspire others to seek the natural solutions they so desperately need.  <br/><br/>Our sister has taught us that health is the most basic human right, and one that should transcend education, geography, and economic status.  She believes that wellness is the quality of life that we are all promised. <br/><br/>In order to deliver her health testimony and the natural healing strategies that will lead to her own recovery, Teresa has begun writing, what she considers, her “gateway book”, <i>Detox Diet 54321</i> – a prelude to a 3-book series.  But, she is going to need your help to keep it going.  <b>She is dedicated to pouring her wealth of natural healing knowledge onto the written page so that she can easily reach people struggling with both physical and mental illness.</b>  As she meticulously chronicles her own journey back from disease, she will prove that the vast majority of disease can be corrected through non-invasive, natural therapies and her book series will focus on the primary obstacles she faces.   <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/656269/files/20140617152431-Detox_Diet_Book-Cover-3D.png?1403043871"" src="""" style=""width: 317.268px; height: 418px;""/><p>When illness struck, Teresa lost her massage business of 13 years, and today she is trapped in the midst of a vicious cycle: her health prevents her from going to work, while unemployment prevents her from buying the whole foods and rejuvenating herbs she needs to heal.  We have pooled our family’s resources, but we are simply unable to give her the vital nourishment she needs.  And so, we humbly come to ask for your help.  <b>With your support, Teresa will (quite literally) re-write the cycle and give her life a very different outcome.</b>  <br/></p><p><b><i>With the generous support of wellness warriors such as yourself, Teresa will be able to return to health, all the while forging the way – and writing the map – for others to do the same. </i></b>  <br/></p><p> <i>(You can find out more about Teresa's dreams of future plans and goals on the <a href=""http://botanicalhealthclub.com/future-plans"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Future Plans</a> page of her website.)</i><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><strong></strong></p><h2><strong><p style=""background-color: #9FF899;"">Become a Part of the Solution</p></strong></h2> Teresa’s skills have the potential to offer radical relief to all those suffering from physical, emotional, mental, and even spiritual illnesses. <b>She knows that no matter what the ailment, there is always a path to wellness. </b> <br/><br/>Our sister is trained in a natural healing system formulated by Naturopath and Master Herbalist Dr. Robert Morse and studied under the founder himself (while at the same time collecting knowledge from other natural healers).  The system uses purely botanicals – organic raw vegan foods and wild-crafted herbal formulas – to initiate the body’s natural healing tendencies.  Dr. Robert Morse’s system has garnished an international following, though has yet to reach many of the people that need it the most.<br/><br/>To give you a general idea of the natural healing system that Dr. Morse teaches and and what it's based upon, feel free to watch the video below:<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FqkXXC1TAMzE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqkXXC1TAMzE&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FqkXXC1TAMzE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/><b>We want you to become part of our sister’s solution, and Teresa wants you to become part of this revolutionary health re-write.  By financially supporting her return to wellness you will be supporting her ability to bring this causative-based therapy (as opposed to treatment-based therapy) to people suffering from chronic and (sometimes) fatal disease.  </b><br/><br/>Natural healing techniques often cause what is known as a healing crisis – or, to put it in laymen’s terms – things get worse before they get better.  Because her mind and body will both go through an intensive detoxification, for a short time Teresa will likely face many amplified symptoms, which have been suppressed with her traditional medications.  With your financial support, Teresa will be able to weather this storm and put her experiences into writing in order to support others through their own healing processes.  <br/><br/><i>(If you’re interested in learning more about Dr. Morse and his approach to wellness, please feel free to check out a page dedicated to <a href=""http://botanicalhealthclub.com/robert-morse-nd"" rel=""noopener nofollow""

target=""_blank"">Testimonials</a> page as Teresa has started collecting testimonies from people who've followed Dr. Morse's natural methods.)</i>
<br/><br/><p><strong></strong></p><h2><strong><p style=""background-color: #9FF899;"">Where the Money Goes</p></strong></h2>Reducing Teresa’s financial stresses for a period of up to 7 months <b>will allow her to wholly concentrate on her own healing and on documenting her journey so that others may then follow in her footsteps. </b><br/> <br/>Your generous donations will be used to fund Teresa’s healing and to support her efforts to bring healing to so many others who have lost their way.  She will be building her website as well as writing her book series.  <b>Her publications and website will form Teresa’s platforms on which she will share her wellness practices with clients across the globe.</b>  <br/><br/>In addition, your donations will support Teresa in moving out of her current living situation (a tumultuous, small space which she shares with 9 other people, all in economic hard times) and return back to Florida to settle herself and her business close to her son once again.  <br/><br/><b>Teresa’s son is her most active wellness supporter; however economic strain, along with her illnesses, has caused them to be separated.</b>  Part of your donation will allow Teresa to reconnect with her son and to benefit from his presence in her life – an ingredient that is essential to her recovery.

<ul>
<li>
<b>$2,400</b><i> for a 4-month supply of herbal formulas – Though her healing process may take longer, this will give Teresa a very beneficial boost on her wellness journey and should be starting to earn a sustainable income through the sale of her books and virtual client series, at which time she will assume the financial burden for her own herbal formulas.</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>$2,000</b><i> for 4 months of organic raw vegan diet @ $500/mo. – It's imperative that Teresa stays on a very clean, wholefood-based diet, working synergistically with the herbal formulas, to detoxify her body and mind, regenerate healthy cells, and beat the cause of her illnesses rather than merely treating the symptoms.</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>$7,400</b><i> for moving back to Florida – Living near to her son and in an environment that is conducive to healing, are vital to Teresa’s recovery, especially with her mental state.</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>$5,000</b><i> for the start-up of her new natural healing venture – Teresa has some fabulous plans for the future which include finishing her current writing, writing a 3-part book series on natural health and healing, starting up a community healing project via the internet, building a functional website for all of her projects and much more!</i><br/>

Teresa Shaw is our sister.  She is also a certified natural health counselor and detoxification specialist, though you may not know it to look at her.  Six years ago, we watched as her health deteriorated, dragging her down into disease and despair.  In a shockingly short enough time, her symptoms and conditions overwhelmed her body and mind.  Today she suffers from debilitating panic disorder and agoraphobia, moderate to severe lung disease (COPD), OCD, depression, GI Tract disorders, obesity, and Systemic Candida – to name just a few.  In the midst of the storm, Teresa wandered off her wellness path and to watch someone you love literally slip away like that, is a most painful trial that our family has to go through.Though many days the path back to wellness feels like an insurmountable feat, we watch every day as Teresa perseveres, determined to live out the life of service that she always felt destined for.  Any other person would be justified in giving in if they had to cope with the obstacles that our sister faces every day of her life.  But Teresa will never give up.  She will also never ask for help, which is why we have taken it upon ourselves to ask for her. Teresa is full of amazing plans for the future and we are dedicated to giving her as much love and support as possible in order to help her come back to herself and back to her life's mission.After the onset of her serious mental conditions, Teresa took advantage of the time she's forced to spend at home and studied to become a natural health counselor.  Her goal was never to keep these natural healing solutions to herself – her goal was to become an inspiration to others.Unable to implement the program herself, her health continued to crumble before her eyes.  Consequently, her life's mission took on another layer of depth.  Now, she is called to heal herself first and lead others by her example.  Though experiencing disease first-hand was never exactly the career path our sister had intended, she is grateful to be able to authentically relate to people facing critical health concerns and chronic disease.With over a decade of experience in the natural health arena, Teresa has learned that the human body always tends towards balance, health, and wellness.  Teresa also believes that nothing in nature functions in isolation and that there is synergy and community everywhere we look: intricate ecosystems that support innumerable life forms, mental health that gives way to physical prosperity, and even forums such as this – where people come together to support worthy causes.  Her dream is to bring nature back to healing and to chronicle her journey back to health in an authentic and un-censored way, and by doing so will inspire others to find their way back as well.(You can read more about Teresa's health challenges, her dreams and more on her About Me page on her website:  BotanicalHealthClub.com)The Goal Few natural health counselors suddenly find themselves on the wrong side of the wellness tracks – but that is exactly where Teresa wound up.  Given her unique background and knowledge of the body’s natural healing processes, she has the opportunity to lead others by her own example.  Her goal is to become the proof – to turn herself into a natural healing success story and to, in turn, inspire others to seek the natural solutions they so desperately need.  Our sister has taught us that health is the most basic human right, and one that should transcend education, geography, and economic status.  She believes that wellness is the quality of life that we are all promised. In order to deliver her health testimony and the natural healing strategies that will lead to her own recovery, Teresa has begun writing, what she considers, her “gateway book”, Detox Diet 54321 – a prelude to a 3-book series.  But, she is going to need your help to keep it going.  She is dedicated to pouring her wealth of natural healing knowledge onto the written page so that she can easily reach people struggling with both physical and mental illness.  As she meticulously chronicles her own journey back from disease, she will prove that the vast majority of disease can be corrected through non-invasive, natural therapies and her book series will focus on the primary obstacles she faces.   When illness struck, Teresa lost her massage business of 13 years, and today she is trapped in the midst of a vicious cycle: her health prevents her from going to work, while unemployment prevents her from buying the whole foods and rejuvenating herbs she needs to heal.  We have pooled our family’s resources, but we are simply unable to give her the vital nourishment she needs.  And so, we humbly come to ask for your help.  With your support, Teresa will (quite literally) re-write the cycle and give her life a very different outcome.  With the generous support of wellness warriors such as yourself, Teresa will be able to return to health, all the while forging the way – and writing the map – for others to do the same.    (You can find out more about Teresa's dreams of future plans and goals on the Future Plans page of her website.)Become a Part of the Solution Teresa’s skills have the potential to offer radical relief to all those suffering from physical, emotional, mental, and even spiritual illnesses. She knows that no matter what the ailment, there is always a path to wellness.  Our sister is trained in a natural healing system formulated by Naturopath and Master Herbalist Dr. Robert Morse and studied under the founder himself (while at the same time collecting knowledge from other natural healers).  The system uses purely botanicals – organic raw vegan foods and wild-crafted herbal formulas – to initiate the body’s natural healing tendencies.  Dr. Robert Morse’s system has garnished an international following, though has yet to reach many of the people that need it the most.To give you a general idea of the natural healing system that Dr. Morse teaches and and what it's based upon, feel free to watch the video below:We want you to become part of our sister’s solution, and Teresa wants you to become part of this revolutionary health re-write.  By financially supporting her return to wellness you will be supporting her ability to bring this causative-based therapy (as opposed to treatment-based therapy) to people suffering from chronic and (sometimes) fatal disease.  Natural healing techniques often cause what is known as a healing crisis – or, to put it in laymen’s terms – things get worse before they get better.  Because her mind and body will both go through an intensive detoxification, for a short time Teresa will likely face many amplified symptoms, which have been suppressed with her traditional medications.  With your financial support, Teresa will be able to weather this storm and put her experiences into writing in order to support others through their own healing processes.  (If you’re interested in learning more about Dr. Morse and his approach to wellness, please feel free to check out a page dedicated to Robert Morse ND on her website.  Also included on the website is a Testimonials page as Teresa has started collecting testimonies from people who've followed Dr. Morse's natural methods.)
Where the Money GoesReducing Teresa’s financial stresses for a period of up to 7 months will allow her to wholly concentrate on her own healing and on documenting her journey so that others may then follow in her footsteps.  Your generous donations will be used to fund Teresa’s healing and to support her efforts to bring healing to so many others who have lost their way.  She will be building her website as well as writing her book series.  Her publications and website will form Teresa’s platforms on which she will share her wellness practices with clients across the globe.  In addition, your donations will support Teresa in moving out of her current living situation (a tumultuous, small space which she shares with 9 other people, all in economic hard times) and return back to Florida to settle herself and her business close to her son once again.  Teresa’s son is her most active wellness supporter; however economic strain, along with her illnesses, has caused them to be separated.  Part of your donation will allow Teresa to reconnect with her son and to benefit from his presence in her life – an ingredient that is essential to her recovery.  


Break-down of How Your Funds Will Be Used:


$2,400 for a 4-month supply of herbal formulas – Though her healing process may take longer, this will give Teresa a very beneficial boost on her wellness journey and should be starting to earn a sustainable income through the sale of her books and virtual client series, at which time she will assume the financial burden for her own herbal formulas.


$2,000 for 4 months of organic raw vegan diet @ $500/mo. – It's imperative that Teresa stays on a very clean, wholefood-based diet, working synergistically with the herbal formulas, to detoxify her body and mind, regenerate healthy cells, and beat the cause of her illnesses rather than merely treating the symptoms.


$7,400 for moving back to Florida – Living near to her son and in an environment that is conducive to healing, are vital to Teresa’s recovery, especially with her mental state.


$5,000 for the start-up of her new natural healing venture – Teresa has some fabulous plans for the future which include finishing her current writing, writing a 3-part book series on natural health and healing, starting up a community healing project via the internet, building a functional website for all of her projects and much more!

  articulated a long overdue vision of human evolutionary transformation

  induces a story trance in a spiritual and artistic way.  Hall weaves his
  words beautifully, while bringing in ideas from such luminaries as Jung and
  Rumi.  Indeed, Hall seems to have taken Rumi so deeply into his heart
  and spirit that there were points in <i>Sophia’s Web</i> where I thought
  “That’s Rumi speaking!” This book pulls together the holistic Earth-Wisdom of
  many physicists, philosophers, psychologists, and myths. It will

  elucidation of a new paradigm of reality that supports this revelation.

 ADVANCE ENDORSEMENTS FOR SOPHIA""S WEB



~ Carolyn Baker, author of Collapsing Consciously, in her Forward
  to Sophia’s Web
“Characteristic of
  Sophia and the feminine principle is not the linear modus operandi of the
  goal-directed masculine, but rather, a web-like, inclusive embrace of all
  that is…Somewhere in the twentieth century, a little boy named Burl Hall
  began at a very early age to grasp this web, and now in 2014 he is joyously
  entangled in it. So entangled is he that he was compelled to write Sophia’s
  Web: A Passionate Call to Heal Our Wounded Nature.“Rarely do we have the opportunity to hear an
  embodied male acknowledge what Burl Hall lays bare in Sophia’s
  Web.”







~ Don Oscar Miro-Quesada,
  co-author, Lessons in Courage: Peruvian
  Shamanic Wisdom for Everyday Life and founder of The Heart of the Healer Foundation
In Sophia's Web, Burl Hall has masterfully
  articulated a long overdue vision of human evolutionary transformation
  found reflected within the inherent integrity of Creation itself. This is a
  book of deep scholarship and heart. It is a purposefully passionate
  proposal for humanity to once again ‘humanize’ itself by reclaiming Gaian
  consciousness as our birthright—a birthright inspired by the perennial wisdom
  of a planetary Goddess culture. It is a work of great merit--I highly
  recommend it!







 ~Rob Kall, Editor-in-Chief of
  OpEdNews, http://www.opednews.com
""I've long enjoyed the energy and heart that Burl
  Hall brings to his article postings at Opednews.com. Sophia’s Web weaves
  together Burl's unique, heartful vision, in the process, taking it to a new
  level. Though non-fiction, the book has been written so it draws the reader in and
  induces a story trance in a spiritual and artistic way.  Hall weaves his
  words beautifully, while bringing in ideas from such luminaries as Jung and
  Rumi.  Indeed, Hall seems to have taken Rumi so deeply into his heart
  and spirit that there were points in Sophia’s Web where I thought
  “That’s Rumi speaking!” This book pulls together the holistic Earth-Wisdom of
  many physicists, philosophers, psychologists, and myths. It will
  inspire you, get you thinking in new, out of the box ways and give you hope for
  the future of humanity within us all.""

























~Anne Baring, author of The Dream of the Cosmos: A Quest for the Soul
""A most wonderful and
  inspiring book, incandescent with personal visionary experience and words
  that communicate in prose that is often poetry. It is offered to us by Burl
  and Merry Hall both as a revelation of Sophia as Divine Source and Container
  of all and, drawing on the work of outstanding scientists, the clear
  elucidation of a new paradigm of reality that supports this revelation.
  Knowing that we are all embraced by Sophia’s Web of Life could lift us out of
  our enslavement to the old dualistic patterns, old divisive beliefs and
  habits that are derived from fear and that now need to be transformed in a
  splendid affirmation of love for all creation. As they write: we need to
  awaken to the realization that “We are all a unity in the
  Godhead.”  








 

~ Kenneth Worthy, author
  of Invisible Nature: Healing the Destructive Divide between People and the
  Environment
""Sophia’s
  Web is
  a passionate call to heal the destructive divides of modern life and embrace
  a unified cosmos rendered once again whole, told from the fiery depths of
  personal experience, mythology, philosophy, and science."" 








 
~
  Cynthia Piano, Creator of Oneness House, www.onenesshouse.net""Sophia's web is ""His""tory and
  ""Her""story woven together with contemporary and ancient
  texts, personal visions, dreams, and philosophical study.  It
  embodies a whole new approach to ""Charlotte's Web,"" bringing
  up to date the core of the separation, whether it be animal,
  human, insect, Earth, or the Cosmos.  The oneness of the
  divine in all, and the equal value of every being is portrayed, whether the
  ""femininity"" of Mary Magdalene/Jesus, or the
  ""masculinity"" of Shiva/Kali.  Reverent and irreverent,
  raw and refined, with a rigorous intellectual, emotional, and

<p>By the age of 15, I decided to leave home and hitch-hike across the 
U.S. Traveling with the man I thought was my soul mate. A violent end to
 the relationship sent me tail-spinning through a life of travel and 
love-affairs where I've sought to find lasting connection. Since then, 
I've have worked with top experts in intimacy, healing, relationships, 
and wellness. I became Certified in Energy Medicine, Health Coaching, 
Vibrational Medicine, Holistic Wellness, and professionally work as an 
Intimacy Coach.</p>
<p>I learned that if we don’t fully love ourselves, we’ll bounce from 
relationship to relationship desperate for connection, sacrificing 
ourselves along the way. This book, is designed to help you understand 
the roadblocks to self-love, and the tools necessary to help you have 
the connection you desire in your relationships. 
I've written Road to Love to share my story and what I've collected 
from top experts and years of personal trial and error about what truly 
creates intimacy. I am passionate about helping people feel the love and

<p><i>Dear
Easton,</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>We’re
in the quiet of your studio. The windows are open, and the warm January night
air carries in the sound of rain falling in the alleyway. The night spilling in
feels warm like some blue green heat wave in the middle of winter. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>You
have no furniture, except one tiny ragged couch. Next to me, you strum and sing
a song about a gypsy thief. I had no idea nylon, wood, and voice could
penetrate me so deeply.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Without
looking at me, you set down your guitar and lay your head against my breasts.
With the soft of my finger, I trace your mango lips. I yearn to taste your
salty sweetness. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The
night finally takes over and we crawl into the darkness of the closet, where
you keep your bed. There is no light in here, not even the dimmest glow. It’s
darker than the faces that linger in the alleyway below.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>In
your arms, I become a writer. My body blank pages. Your body, the pen, writing
a story of love into me. My pages quickly fill with the black ink of this
night. In the defining darkness, I feel like I belong. My virgin body effortlessly
takes you in. I cradle you inside me. The emptiness floods with color. My heart
spills its truth in slight whimpers. We say nothing. We see nothing. We feel
everything in this pitch black cavern.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Our
story is written in my cells now,</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Kamala</i></p>
<p>Intimacy
calls us not only into deep connection with another, but also with ourselves.
Intimacy is about engaging with the pleasurable pulse of life. It’s about
feeling the flow of energy that pulses through all things. When you
are intimately engaged with life, everything you experience is enjoyable—the
wind brushing your skin, the prolonged eye contact with the cashier, even the
sting of heartbreak. It is all magnificent. </p>
<p>When
everything is pleasurable, we don’t experience the pain of losing pleasure. It
is said that all suffering comes from attachment or aversion. If you are always
experiencing the pleasure of each sensation, you don’t become attached or have
aversion to “good” or “bad” feelings.</p>
<p>Explore
how deeply you can open to pleasure. Let the mundane become sensual and allow
your entire body to penetrate and be penetrated by the universe.</p>
<p><b>Roadmap
to Intimacy—Opening to Pleasure</b></p>
<p><span>1.<span> 
</span></span>Allow yourself to rest alone in a comfortable position. </p>
<p><span>2.<span> 
</span></span>Take slow deep breaths. As you exhale, breathe all the way
down your body and <span>  into your feet. As you inhale,
breathe all the way from your feet up to the top of   your head.</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span> 
</span></span>Consider that there is a wave of energy that comes up from
the earth and pulses <span>  all
the way up your legs, up your torso, and out the top of your head.</span></p>
<p><span>Now feel that wave
moving from your head, down your torso and legs and out the   bottom of your feet. This
wave ideally would be a slow steady pulse like a gentle   ocean tide or move like a long steady breath. If your
body is constricted or you   shut
off parts of you, like your pelvis or your heart, then the wave can’t pulse all the way through you. </span></p>
<p><span>4.<span> 
</span></span>Notice how your body feels. Notice where your body or your
breath might feel <span>  constricted.
What is enjoyable about this experience? </span></p>
<p><span>5.<span> 
</span></span>Notice what parts of your body have pleasurable sensations.
Allow your breath to <span>move
into the areas of your body that feel pleasure. Allow your breath to heighten   whatever pleasure
you’re experiencing. </span></p>
<p><span>6.<span> 
</span></span>Either journal about what you discovered or share with a
partner.</p>

looking at me, you set down your guitar and lay your head against my breasts.
With the soft of my finger, I trace your mango lips. I yearn to taste your
salty sweetness. 

The
night finally takes over and we crawl into the darkness of the closet, where
you keep your bed. There is no light in here, not even the dimmest glow. It’s
darker than the faces that linger in the alleyway below.

In
your arms, I become a writer. My body blank pages. Your body, the pen, writing
a story of love into me. My pages quickly fill with the black ink of this
night. In the defining darkness, I feel like I belong. My virgin body effortlessly
takes you in. I cradle you inside me. The emptiness floods with color. My heart
spills its truth in slight whimpers. We say nothing. We see nothing. We feel
everything in this pitch black cavern.

Our
story is written in my cells now,

Kamala
Intimacy
calls us not only into deep connection with another, but also with ourselves.
Intimacy is about engaging with the pleasurable pulse of life. It’s about
feeling the flow of energy that pulses through all things. When you
are intimately engaged with life, everything you experience is enjoyable—the
wind brushing your skin, the prolonged eye contact with the cashier, even the
sting of heartbreak. It is all magnificent. 
When
everything is pleasurable, we don’t experience the pain of losing pleasure. It
is said that all suffering comes from attachment or aversion. If you are always
experiencing the pleasure of each sensation, you don’t become attached or have
aversion to “good” or “bad” feelings.
Explore
how deeply you can open to pleasure. Let the mundane become sensual and allow
your entire body to penetrate and be penetrated by the universe.
Roadmap
to Intimacy—Opening to Pleasure
1. 
Allow yourself to rest alone in a comfortable position. 
2. 
Take slow deep breaths. As you exhale, breathe all the way
down your body and   into your feet. As you inhale,
breathe all the way from your feet up to the top of   your head.
3. 
Consider that there is a wave of energy that comes up from
the earth and pulses   all
the way up your legs, up your torso, and out the top of your head.
Now feel that wave
moving from your head, down your torso and legs and out the   bottom of your feet. This
wave ideally would be a slow steady pulse like a gentle   ocean tide or move like a long steady breath. If your
body is constricted or you   shut
off parts of you, like your pelvis or your heart, then the wave can’t pulse all the way through you. 
4. 
Notice how your body feels. Notice where your body or your
breath might feel   constricted.
What is enjoyable about this experience? 
5. 
Notice what parts of your body have pleasurable sensations.
Allow your breath to move
into the areas of your body that feel pleasure. Allow your breath to heighten   whatever pleasure
you’re experiencing. 
6. 
Either journal about what you discovered or share with a
partner.

<p><strong>In ancient times</strong> those who practiced healing arts understood that at the core of human existence was sexual energy. There is a certain truth at the core of sex. Some call it magic. This was a mighty force in the old world. It has been watered down in the modern day, perverted and altered so much we no longer recognize the act of sexual intimacy as sacred. We see it as superfluous, adjunct, a luxury, but not necessary to spiritual development.</p>
<p>There was a time when those who were consulted before a war, political movements and even when to reap a harvest, were women. Not just ordinary women but those who proudly claim the title of Priestess.<br/><br/> Many legends and stories are told about the ancient Grecian Priestesses. Some say that it was every woman’s obligation or duty to spend time at the Temple of Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love. In order to know the art of Eros a woman, prior to marriage, would spend time at the Temple sitting on the steps. This duty was for the aristocracy and the peasants alike; privilege did not absolve one of her life-lessons in the erotic arts. Some women, being rough-faced may spend years on the Temple stairs. They too were eventually chosen.<br/>  <br/> Each woman manifested Eros in her unique way. If music was in her soul, she may dance. If the delights of the body moved her, she my strip naked and sit on a male Seeker’s lap. If she was inclined to place her mouth on his, she would twine her tongue artistically with his, drawing on his growing desire for her. There was little teaching for this, as sexuality and spirituality were married, conjoined, considered one. The highest moment, the most divine experience being the moment of ecstasy until the cumulative orgasm peaked. How a woman was, how she moved, her predilections for sex were gifted by the Goddess, for the divine feminine was thought to move through her while in the clutches of Eros. This moment of release was supernatural, from the realm of the great gods and goddesses, the very moment that brought a human into existence.</p>
<p>Once the Priestess gained her experience she was free to leave the Temple and marry. Now she had skills and knowledge to bring to the marriage bed, to delight and entreat her man, to draw down the divine feminine into her life.<br/><br/> These sacred arts have been revived today as a secret society hidden in plain view. This is a riveting story told of actual accounts from an ordained Priestess in a modern-day temple. The only Goddess Temple to occur as it did where each woman was sovereign and could earn the title of Priestess if that was her desire. She received all who asked for her in various forms of intimacy.<br/><br/> The Temple that manifested in this reality was filled with women learning the sacred art. They were deeply and innately drawn to sexuality. These women were largely unguided although each learned more in her own way in every session and with each Seeker that visited the temple.</p>

<p>Bonjour!</p>
<p>Je m'appelle Myriam Plante, et j'ai lancé mon premier roman fantastique, Le Parfum du Vent, le 7 décembre 2014. Mon roman a été publié à compte d'auteure, suite au succès de ma <a href=""http://igg.me/at/leparfumduvent%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">campagne de financement sur Indiegogo</a>.</p>
<p>Cet été, j'ai eu l'idée de me lancer dans un nouveau projet qui me permettra de partager mon roman avec plus de gens, mais aussi de commencer l'écriture d'un petit recueil de nouvelles. Ce projet me permettra aussi de supporter la recherche sur le cancer en aidant ma cousine à atteindre son objectif de financement pour son Challenge SRC.</p>
<p>Continuez votre lecture pour en apprendre plus, et pour voir de quelle manière vous pouvez contribuer à mon projet!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433527724/ouppe2pf1y880vrk3ve7.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
</div>Livrez au Suivant est un projet inspiré du concept de «Donnez au suivant». («Livrez» pour «donnez», mais aussi, pour «livre»... Quel beau jeu de mot.)<br/><br/>Le principe est simple: 10 copies de mon roman sont mises en vente ici, sur la page du projet. Elles seront numérotées, et le but du projet sera écrit sur la première page de chaque livre.<br/><br/>Mon roman se vend normalement 25$, avec des frais de poste de 5$. Ici, vous pouvez acheter une copie pour seulement 10$... mais à une condition! Lorsque votre lecture sera terminée (ou avant que votre lecture soit terminée, si vous n'aimez pas le livre!) vous devrez donner votre copie à une autre personne de votre entourage... Cette même personne, une fois sa lecture terminée, devra continuer à faire circuler le roman.<br/><br/>Chaque lecteur sera invité à laisser un commentaire sur une page de mon blogue, pour qu'il soit possible de retracer le voyage entrepris par chaque copie du roman. Le personnage principal de mon histoire est un dragon.... Jusqu'où voyagera-t-il?<br/><br/>Chaque personne qui achètera une copie du roman pourra aussi me lancer un petit défi d'écriture! Si vous décidez de participer, vous pourrez m'envoyer un courriel avec une phrase que vous aurez composée. Cette phrase sera utilisée comme première phrase d'une histoire courte que j'écrirai, dans le style de votre choix.<br/><br/>Je remettrai la moitié de l'argent amassé au cours de ce projet à ma cousine Marie-Noëlle Audet, qui participera à une expédition en Islande dans le cadre du Challenge SRC organisé par la Société de recherche sur le cancer.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433528647/zjohnuxhktyijmvcsfqg.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>Mon roman, Le Parfum du Vent, est une histoire racontée du point de vue unique d'un dragon. Ce dragon a sauvé de la mort une petite humaine qui était condamnée à être dévorée par des loups... ou par d'autres dragons. Des années plus tard, il devra se lier d'amitié avec un magicien afin de partir à la recherche de cette humaine, qui a disparu.<br/><br/>Le dragon qui se dévoile dans ce roman n'est pas une simple créature fantastique, mais plutôt un être doté d'intelligence pour qui la couleur des plaines, des forêts et du ciel, tout comme la force des liens qui unissent deux êtres, ont plus d'importance que la magie, le pouvoir, et les guerres menées par les humains.<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F3KQLyG9XlQk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D3KQLyG9XlQk&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F3KQLyG9XlQk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>Pour en apprendre plus sur le roman, et pour télécharger gratuitement un extrait, visitez mon site Internet:<br/><a href=""http://myriamplante.com/dragon.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://myriamplante.com/dragon.htm</a><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433529822/hndoerbydpswdsvkujfu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Ma cousine Marie-Noëlle participera au Challenge SRC, organisé par la Société de recherche sur le cancer.

Je m'appelle Myriam Plante, et j'ai lancé mon premier roman fantastique, Le Parfum du Vent, le 7 décembre 2014. Mon roman a été publié à compte d'auteure, suite au succès de ma campagne de financement sur Indiegogo.
Cet été, j'ai eu l'idée de me lancer dans un nouveau projet qui me permettra de partager mon roman avec plus de gens, mais aussi de commencer l'écriture d'un petit recueil de nouvelles. Ce projet me permettra aussi de supporter la recherche sur le cancer en aidant ma cousine à atteindre son objectif de financement pour son Challenge SRC.
Continuez votre lecture pour en apprendre plus, et pour voir de quelle manière vous pouvez contribuer à mon projet!

Livrez au Suivant est un projet inspiré du concept de «Donnez au suivant». («Livrez» pour «donnez», mais aussi, pour «livre»... Quel beau jeu de mot.)Le principe est simple: 10 copies de mon roman sont mises en vente ici, sur la page du projet. Elles seront numérotées, et le but du projet sera écrit sur la première page de chaque livre.Mon roman se vend normalement 25$, avec des frais de poste de 5$. Ici, vous pouvez acheter une copie pour seulement 10$... mais à une condition! Lorsque votre lecture sera terminée (ou avant que votre lecture soit terminée, si vous n'aimez pas le livre!) vous devrez donner votre copie à une autre personne de votre entourage... Cette même personne, une fois sa lecture terminée, devra continuer à faire circuler le roman.Chaque lecteur sera invité à laisser un commentaire sur une page de mon blogue, pour qu'il soit possible de retracer le voyage entrepris par chaque copie du roman. Le personnage principal de mon histoire est un dragon.... Jusqu'où voyagera-t-il?Chaque personne qui achètera une copie du roman pourra aussi me lancer un petit défi d'écriture! Si vous décidez de participer, vous pourrez m'envoyer un courriel avec une phrase que vous aurez composée. Cette phrase sera utilisée comme première phrase d'une histoire courte que j'écrirai, dans le style de votre choix.Je remettrai la moitié de l'argent amassé au cours de ce projet à ma cousine Marie-Noëlle Audet, qui participera à une expédition en Islande dans le cadre du Challenge SRC organisé par la Société de recherche sur le cancer.Mon roman, Le Parfum du Vent, est une histoire racontée du point de vue unique d'un dragon. Ce dragon a sauvé de la mort une petite humaine qui était condamnée à être dévorée par des loups... ou par d'autres dragons. Des années plus tard, il devra se lier d'amitié avec un magicien afin de partir à la recherche de cette humaine, qui a disparu.Le dragon qui se dévoile dans ce roman n'est pas une simple créature fantastique, mais plutôt un être doté d'intelligence pour qui la couleur des plaines, des forêts et du ciel, tout comme la force des liens qui unissent deux êtres, ont plus d'importance que la magie, le pouvoir, et les guerres menées par les humains.Pour en apprendre plus sur le roman, et pour télécharger gratuitement un extrait, visitez mon site Internet:http://myriamplante.com/dragon.htmMa cousine Marie-Noëlle participera au Challenge SRC, organisé par la Société de recherche sur le cancer. Ce Challenge la conduira en Islande, pays qu'elle rêve de visiter depuis longtemps. Son défi consiste aussi à amasser 10 000$ au profit de la Société de recherche sur le cancer.En décidant de lui remettre la moitié des fonds recueillis pendant ce projet Indiegogo, je supporte son rêve, mais surtout, je supporte un organisme qui soutient la prévention et le traitement d'une terrible maladie.Vous pouvez en apprendre plus sur Marie-Noëlle et son Challenge SRC en visitant sa page personnelle:http://crschallengesrc.kintera.org/islande2016/marienoelleVous pouvez aussi lui faire un don directement sur sa page personnelle. Chaque don est grandement apprécié!Vous pouvez également suivre son projet sur Facebook:http://facebook.com/MarieEnIslandeLes contreparties sont les cadeaux que vous pouvez obtenir en participant à Livrez au Suivant.Pour 3$: Vous pouvez m'envoyer par courriel au myriam.plante@yahoo.ca votre nom, ainsi qu'une phrase que vous avez composée, et qui servira d'inspiration et de point de départ à une histoire courte que j'écrirai. Chaque histoire courte sera ajoutée à un recueil de nouvelles. Vous pouvez aussi me dire quel genre d'histoire vous aimeriez que j'écrive à partir de votre phrase (fantastique, horreur, romance... à vous de choisir!) Lorsque mon recueil de nouvelles sera terminé, il sera publié en format numérique, et je vous en enverrai une copie par courriel. Pour 10$: En plus de pouvoir m'envoyer par courriel une phrase qui servira d'inspiration pour une histoire courte, vous recevrez par la poste une copie du roman fantastique Le Parfum du Vent, que vous devrez «livrer au suivant» après votre lecture. Les 5 premières copies du roman seront accompagnées d'un stylo du Challenge SRC, d'une valeur de 3$.

<h3>Le projet</h3>
<p>Sur les rails depuis maintenant 5 ans, je suis un conducteur de trains passionné par ce qu'il fait. Une idée saugrenue m'est venue il y a peu: Pourquoi ne pas me lancer dans la création d'un jeu de plateau sur la thématique de mon métier, avec ses multiples situations qui peuvent causer des retards, ses spécificités, son monde ""à part""... Et mon expérience étant totalement localisée en Belgique, il me paraît bien d'en faire bénéficier le projet: Chaque matériel ou ligne possède ses caractéristiques, je dirais même tout simplement sn caractère... C'est au travers d'un tel jeu que j'ai décidé de vous faire partager cela. </p>
<p>C'est en à peine une nuit que cette idée a commencé à prendre forme, le lendemain matin, j'avais les règles du jeu en tête ainsi que la structure matérielle de ce dernier. J'en suis donc déjà à la phase de réalisation, le plateau de jeu a pris sa forme quasi définitive et les cartes sont en cours de confection. Ce projet me passionne tellement qu'il est très probable que je distribue une première version jouable (sans les artworks) autour de moi dans les semaines qui viennent afin d'en tester les règles.</p>
<p>Le nom du jeu n'est pas encore défini, plusieurs idées se bousculent mais mon choix définitif ne devrait pas tarder.</p>
<p>Il ne faudra pas être un passionné du rail belge pour apprécier ce jeu, il sera simple, amusant, pour toute la famille, avec une bon équilibre entre la stratégie et la chance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>En (très gros) résumé, le jeu se passe ainsi:<br/>- Au premier tour, chaque joueur(de 2 à 4) pêche au hasard une carte ""train"" qui déterminera le bonus/malus de la partie.(les cartes trains représentent les différentes automotrices et rames tractées qui roulent en Belgique). Ensuite, 2 cartes ""mouvement"" par joueur sont pêchées, ces dernières indiqueront la gare de départ du train(2 jetons colorés y seront placés, 1 pour retenir la gare d'origine et 1 pour la position du train). Ces cartes seront mises sur la table devant le joueur.<br/>- Ensuite, à chaque tour, les joueurs piochent une carte. Si il s'agit d'un simple mouvement, ils se déplacent du nombre de cases indiqué ou remplacent une des 2 cartes sur la table et jouent cette dernière, si il s'agit d'une carte ""perturbation"", ils doivent en respecter les instructions directement.<br/>- Le but du jeu est d'accumuler un maximum de points en un certain nombre de tours(possibilité de jouer des parties courtes ou longues). Pour accumuler des points, il faut tomber exactement sur une case ""gare"", le nombre de points est déterminé par le nombre de ""points d'arrêts"" situés entre la gare d'origine et la gare sur laquelle on est tombé. Si on passe outre la gare(nombre de cases à parcourir trop élevé), on déplace le jeton gare d'origine dans cette dernière et on continue le mouvement à sa convenance. Il est interdit de changer de direction sauf en gare, un train ne peut pas non plus dépasser un autre train sur la même ligne si ce dernier va dans la même direction.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Pourquoi fais-je appel au crowd funding?</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Bien qu'il me soit possible de sortir une version ""avec les moyens du bord"", le but final est d'éditer ce jeu afin qu'il soit commercialisé. Pour ce faire, je dois passer par diverses sociétés d'impression pour les cartes, la boîte et le plateau. La quantité minimale pour que cela soit intéressant au niveau du prix de vente pour les joueurs est telle qu'un investissement de départ conséquent est requis.</li>
<li>En ce qui concerne les artworks, je suis passionné de photographie et je suis désireux d'illustrer moi-même mes cartes, cela me demandera énormément de temps, de déplacements et de travail. Un tel investissement personnel est beaucoup plus facile à mettre en œuvre lorsque l'on sait que le projet pourra être mené à bien.</li>
<li>Si la totalité des fonds nécessaires n'est pas atteinte, je ferai tout mon possible pour rendre ce jeu réel, en diminuant les quantités de départ ou en passant par d'autres pistes de conception matérielles. Ce jeu verra le jour, même si je ne dois en créer qu'une poignée d'exemplaires pour tous ceux qui ont participé à son financement et se réjouissent de l'avoir en main.</li>
<li>Si le succès est de la partie, je me lancerai très certainement avec le plus grand des plaisirs dans d'autres projets de jeux de plateau. Les idées sont là, mises sur le côté en attendant que je réalise celle-ci jusqu'au bout :)</li>
<li>De votre côté, participer vous permettra de bénéficier d'un prix avantageux, ou d'autres goodies liés à la conception du jeu(ensembles de photos, etc...). Je veux vous faire apprécier chaque contribution, aussi petite soit-elle. Et tout contributeur à ce projet sera également remercié personnellement, cette liste de remerciement nominative sera distribuée avec chaque boîte de jeu.</li>
<li>Je désire clôturer ce projet d'ici la fin de l'année(artworks, rédaction du règlement complet, tests en famille/entre amis, accords avec les sociétés d'impression). Une version néerlandaise du jeu sera également disponible au même moment, selon la demande. Idéalement, les premiers exemplaires seront distribués entre janvier et mars 2014. Cela se produira peut-être avant.</li>

translators etc.</span>

<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
</p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">(Un)like
many other “crowdfunders” we are starting this campaign with <b>results</b> and <b>achieved goals.</b> </p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Hourglass Literary Magazine’s Issue
No.1</i> featured
authors are <b>Philip Ó Ceallaigh</b>, Irish short-story writer and the winner of
Rooney Prize for Irish Literature in 2006, and <b>David Albahari</b>, Serbian writer
residing in Calgary, Canada and a member of the Serbian Academy of Science and
Arts. David Albahari has been the recipient of many literary awards and prizes,
including the NIN Award (1996), Bridge Berlin Award (1998) and in 2012 Vilenica
Prize.</p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>The first issue of the Hourglass
Magazine is dedicated to Danilo Kiš.</b> Thanks to Danilo Kiš's ex-wife Mrs Mirjana Miočinović,
we gained exclusive rights to be the first to print<span> Danilo Kiš's unpublished works in
English, including interviews, essays and short stories. Although Danilo Kiš's
works were published in over thirty languages during his lifetime, Susan Sontag
was probably first writer to introduce Kiš to a wider, global audience, editing
the non-fiction works of Kiš in <i>Homo
Poeticus: Essays and Interviews</i>. Subsequently, the award winning British
historian Mark Thompson published <i>Birth
Certificate: The Story of Danilo Kiš</i>; in 2013 this biographical piece was
shortlisted for the National Book Critics Circle Award and later went on to be
awarded the Jan Michalski Prize for Literature. And now at <i>Hourglass Literary Magazine</i> we strive to continue this rich saga
and present this master's works to the widest audience possible. </span></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Mark
Thompson, along with Jasna Šamić, Filip David, Sibelan Forrester, John K. Cox
and Gojko Božović will be contributing in the inaugural issue.</b></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In the
closing section, erudite writer and translator <b>Brett Alan Sanders</b>, and
prominent author and LGBT activist <b>Dragoslava Barzut</b>, will be reviewing the
latest global developments in the ""Year Under Review"".</p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hourglass
Literary Magazine’s contributors wrote for us, understood our concept well,
discussed with us, even advised us and gave us their writings to be published
and translated with no <b>financial consideration!</b>
<b>Perhaps, they are our true benefactors. </b></p>

<p><i>Hourglass Literary Magazine </i>ran an
international writing competition which attracted 1200+ writers with more than
1500+ submissions in three categories – Best Short Story, Best Essay and Best

have been submissions by authors writing in English from United States, Great
Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, France, Russian Federation, Sweden,
Turkey, Germany, Austria, Spain, Czech Republic, Portugal, India, Greece,
Italy, Netherlands, South Africa, Pakistan, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Poland,

FINAL NOTE</h4>
<div>
<p>Hourglass Literary Magazine is run by writers
and writers comprise the board, jury and editoral staff.</p>
<p>Our thoughts stumbled upon running
crowdfunding campaign based on the magazine’s pre-orders, once we realized
<b>how many people visit our web site daily</b>. Very soon we started to receive our first
subscriptions and donations via the web site’s link (which was rather hidden than
exposed).<br/></p>
<p>Couple of months later, in one of our
contestants’ <i>cover pages </i>we read:</p>
<p><i>While exploring your magazine’s website, I stumbled upon its
manifesto, which I read with great interest. The Hourglass goal: “achieving
international mélange” (originally <b>intercultural</b>
mélange), particularly resonated with me… </i>said
one writer to whom we want to thank for allowing us to quote excerpt from his <i>submission cover page</i>.</p>
<p>So, it was not surprising to receive such
letters of support:<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467326499/Screen_Shot_2016-06-01_at_9.02.50_PM_h1niln.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<div>
<p>Now, we have a complete list of contributors,
and as the jury evaluates <b>1500+</b>
submissions from <b>1200+</b> authors from
all around the globe, as translators and proofreaders pore over texts, Hourglass
Literary Magazine’s <b>impact is quite obvious<i>.</i>
We believe it could, it should, it must be more powerful.</b></p>

</div></div>","We solicit your kind support for the Hourglass Literary Magazine, an annual and bilingual publication from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Hourglass aims to
present to readers both emerging as well as established writers who write in English
and the BCMS languages comprising Bosnian,
Croatian, Serbian and Montenegrin. The magazine is staffed
mostly by volunteers (most of them writers) from Former Yugoslavia,
as well as from Spain, Hong Kong and United States, and is the first and
(probably) the only literary journal from Bosnia and Herzegovina to have made it
internationally, reaching readers across the globe. Hourglass Literary Magazine is also the first literary magazine
from Bosnia and Herzegovina to become member of CLMP – [ c l m p ] – Community of
Literary Magazines and Presses.





As we are
aware that possible contributions come from your hard-working earned money, we have put together this proposal/pitch to
provide to you the best possible perks (rewards) for your support, and although
our campaign is based on magazine’s pre-orders, there are many perks
(rewards) that can help us reach not only primary goal, but also our “stretched
goal”.

IN SHORT
We strive – and this is our manifesto’s core
– to mix voices in one polyphonic
structure, i.e. to connect writers who write in English, whether as native
English speakers or international, with authors who write in what it used to be
one language – Serbo-Croatian – but is
now, after the civil war, segmented into the four languages – Bosnian,
Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian.
Through the pages of the magazine we also aim
to take a stand against all forms of violence and bigotry that attempts to
infiltrate and override our collective sanity. Hourglass Literary Magazine’s manifesto’s can be found via our website.
The Hourglass
Literary Magazine Issue No. 1 is awaiting final touches by our dedicated
team of editors and staff members: Lana Bastašić, Lejla Kalamujić , Anirban Ray
Choudhury, Jelena Lengold, Sibelan Forrester, John K. Cox Tea Tulić, Nemanja Mićević, Đurđica
Bjelošević and Tanja Stupar-Trifunović.





PERKS/REWARDS (in short)


If you are already
asking yourself how much it will cost and how do I help? – pre-ordering/subscription
to Hourglass Literary Magazine Issue No.
1 is what we consider as our featured
perk. As reward receive Hourglass Literary Magazine Issue No. 1 with shipping included.

Supporting Hourglass
Literary Magazine, even if we don’t reach our campaign goal, will make it
possible to sell the magazine at a lower price $15-17 + shipping and,
again, note that right now, via our
campaign, you can receive Hourglass
Literary Magazine Issue No. 1 for $15
with shipping included, what more
every perk (reward) comes with free shipping.

There are various choices/options for contributing towards our
effort, with rewards ranging from a “Thank You” note on our website and social
media or a “Thank You” note in our printed and digital editions to a bundle of
books by and about Danilo Kis. Apart from individuals, academic institutions,
libraries, bookstores and workshops as well as private schools, universities
and commercial institutions are eligible to pre-order Hourglass Literary Magazine Issue No.1.


HOURGLASS AND COMMUNITY
Our stretched goal is to organize literary festival and artist in residence program in 2017. At Hourglass Literary Magazine we feel
responsible to contribute to community and writing communities. Literary festival and artist in residence program are very distinctive projects
and we do not imagine that a crowdfunding campaign can cope with the costs of
such events, but it can certainly help us to involve and financially encourage grant
and technical writers, grant researchers, coordinators, social network managers,
translators etc.


Our campaign will last for sixty (60) days,
and there will be more perks announced every couple of weeks as we continue to
collaborate with artists from around the globe. For instance Escola Bloom, a Spain based workshop, will happily read, edit and provide one to two hours Skype chat for an emerging writer who needs feedback on his writings (available now). Other interesting perks include postcards (currently in print)
of old and contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina with handwritten THANK YOU note.


(AVAILABLE NOW)
(Note: Perks
with short description are on the right side of this page; to learn more about our
perks/rewards in-depth, please find it within this page.)
HOURGLASS LITERARY MAGAZINE ISSUE NO. 1


(Un)like
many other “crowdfunders” we are starting this campaign with results and achieved goals. 
Hourglass Literary Magazine’s Issue
No.1 featured
authors are Philip Ó Ceallaigh, Irish short-story writer and the winner of
Rooney Prize for Irish Literature in 2006, and David Albahari, Serbian writer
residing in Calgary, Canada and a member of the Serbian Academy of Science and
Arts. David Albahari has been the recipient of many literary awards and prizes,
including the NIN Award (1996), Bridge Berlin Award (1998) and in 2012 Vilenica
Prize.
The first issue of the Hourglass
Magazine is dedicated to Danilo Kiš. Thanks to Danilo Kiš's ex-wife Mrs Mirjana Miočinović,
we gained exclusive rights to be the first to print Danilo Kiš's unpublished works in
English, including interviews, essays and short stories. Although Danilo Kiš's
works were published in over thirty languages during his lifetime, Susan Sontag
was probably first writer to introduce Kiš to a wider, global audience, editing
the non-fiction works of Kiš in Homo
Poeticus: Essays and Interviews. Subsequently, the award winning British
historian Mark Thompson published Birth
Certificate: The Story of Danilo Kiš; in 2013 this biographical piece was
shortlisted for the National Book Critics Circle Award and later went on to be
awarded the Jan Michalski Prize for Literature. And now at Hourglass Literary Magazine we strive to continue this rich saga
and present this master's works to the widest audience possible. 
Mark
Thompson, along with Jasna Šamić, Filip David, Sibelan Forrester, John K. Cox
and Gojko Božović will be contributing in the inaugural issue.
In the
closing section, erudite writer and translator Brett Alan Sanders, and
prominent author and LGBT activist Dragoslava Barzut, will be reviewing the
latest global developments in the ""Year Under Review"".

Hourglass
Literary Magazine’s contributors wrote for us, understood our concept well,
discussed with us, even advised us and gave us their writings to be published
and translated with no financial consideration!
Perhaps, they are our true benefactors. 
II



Hourglass Literary Magazine ran an
international writing competition which attracted 1200+ writers with more than
1500+ submissions in three categories – Best Short Story, Best Essay and Best
Poem. Apart from writers who sent in their submissions from Former Yugoslavia, there
have been submissions by authors writing in English from United States, Great
Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, France, Russian Federation, Sweden,
Turkey, Germany, Austria, Spain, Czech Republic, Portugal, India, Greece,
Italy, Netherlands, South Africa, Pakistan, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Poland,
etc. The full list of countries as well
as exact number of submissions will be announced once the jury is ready
with the long list of accepted works in July
2016.

For 2015/2016 we have
managed to provide $5000+ in total
prizes to our contestants. This is thanks
to the following  benefactors

the first international literary
festival in Bosnia and Herzegovina which will amalgamate with the awards
ceremony and will feature:
· 
Book promotions by established
authors.
· 
Workshops.
· 
Readings (by contestants as well
as by established authors).
· 
Musical events and art
exhibitions.
· 
Debates / round tables.
We hope to welcome you “at the confluence of the
East and the West”, in Bosnia and Herzegovina next year (2017).
II
It is planned that Hourglass Literary Magazine’s
ARTIST IN RESIDENCE program will host both emerging and established writers; the attendees
will be guests of awards ceremony and literary festival. ARTIST IN RESIDENCE should cover:
· 
One month in one of Croatia’s
cities.
· 
Airline ticket and full
hospitality.
· 
Access to library.
· 
Host, and, most importantly, place
to write free, without distractions.

FINAL NOTE

Hourglass Literary Magazine is run by writers
and writers comprise the board, jury and editoral staff.
Our thoughts stumbled upon running
crowdfunding campaign based on the magazine’s pre-orders, once we realized
how many people visit our web site daily. Very soon we started to receive our first
subscriptions and donations via the web site’s link (which was rather hidden than
exposed).
Couple of months later, in one of our
contestants’ cover pages we read:
While exploring your magazine’s website, I stumbled upon its
manifesto, which I read with great interest. The Hourglass goal: “achieving
international mélange” (originally intercultural
mélange), particularly resonated with me… said
one writer to whom we want to thank for allowing us to quote excerpt from his submission cover page.
So, it was not surprising to receive such
letters of support:





Now, we have a complete list of contributors,
and as the jury evaluates 1500+
submissions from 1200+ authors from
all around the globe, as translators and proofreaders pore over texts, Hourglass
Literary Magazine’s impact is quite obvious.
We believe it could, it should, it must be more powerful.

If you are clueless to what your talented son has done or is doing as an athlete or young man in the streets, this movie is for you. If you have a daughter that seems to gravitate to these athletes this movie is for you too. It will uncover many things that go on within the streets and athletic lives of young men and women from the ground level to the top floor.It will also uncover the struggles of parenting these young men and women. This movie will also uncover the struggles of a professional athlete trying to make the cut, but the struggle and surrounding people are the same just on a higher level.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $10000 to get the script written. All money will be paid to writer. If I dont reach targeted goal, all money will still still go to writer. I have an excellent writer with alot of industry experience. Her name is CAROLE PARKER who wrote FILLMORE starring SNOOP DOGG. We are very excited for this project, but as you will learn in the movie, most former professional athletes are done wrong and handled inproper, making life after football a nightmare. I am a full time student who just completed his MS in PE/Athletics &amp; Sports Business Administration. I also Have A BFA in Media Production. I have been going to school for the past 10 years and surviving off of financial aid and a small highschool coaching job, while others who are already rich get richer talking about how they cheated after making money cheating. The time is now.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help me in completeing a dream of getting a movie done that educates the world on street life combined with sports and the obsticles faced to succeed as an athlete. This will also help inspire those in a similar situation to continue to fight and prosper and pursue their dream. Also this film will open the eyes of nieve parents, coaches, and friends of the struggling about the participation of a son or daughter growing up in the streets and dealing with each other. Ask yourself as a parent, What is my son or daughter doing at school, at parties, with these athletes, how are they treated and treating each other? what are the coaches like? how do they help? etc</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help out financially, I would appreciate if you can help put the word out about this script/movie to any and everyone that may potentially help in the cause. I believe that this will be such a powerful eye-opening movie.</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
My Name is Tim I grew up in Watts,Compton and South Central Los Angeles.
I have finally decided to tell my story about how hard it was to be me, raised by a single parent in very dangerous, gang, drug, murder, infested citites. The things I had to do and overcome, in order to go to school, play football and attend practices while trying to make it out alive, earn a scholarship for free education and make it as a professional athlete,all while being undersized and in many cases alone. Contributors will help get a story out that needs to be told and seen. This is for athletes and parents with the same struggles. It's for fans of the sport or anybody curious enough to see what young men go through to survive and still accomplish a dream. Its Inspirational and very Educational. If you are clueless to what your talented son has done or is doing as an athlete or young man in the streets, this movie is for you. If you have a daughter that seems to gravitate to these athletes this movie is for you too. It will uncover many things that go on within the streets and athletic lives of young men and women from the ground level to the top floor.It will also uncover the struggles of parenting these young men and women. This movie will also uncover the struggles of a professional athlete trying to make the cut, but the struggle and surrounding people are the same just on a higher level.

<p>We started Mag Monster to be able to do what we love the most: make magazines! And to be able to make as many magazines as we can, we have started this crowdfunding drive.</p>
<h2>
<br/><strong>Update May 29th</strong>: Tweet about us or like us on Facebook and get a free special issue of the mag!</h2>
<p>Okay, so our crowdfunder can probably use a bit of extra help. We have decided to add a few incentives for the people who would like to help us out. If you tweet about our crowdfunding drive, or like us on Facebook, you will get a free copy of the special Pixar issue of Animatonic, which we will release digitally in August. If you can get other people to tweet about us or like us on Facebook as well, then you will also get a free copy of the Animatonic Yearbook, which is coming out digitally at the end of the year. These special issues will normally retail for $3 (Pixar issue) and $5 (Yearbook).</p>
<p>We have also added an extra incentive for advertisers. You can buy a full page ad in one of our mags for $100, or you can buy our Ad Special for $200, which will not only give you a full page ad, but also a free 12 page digital mag about your product. You can decide what you will do with the mag, but we will also put it up on our website and promote it through our Twitter-feeds and mags. We are very dedicated to make Mag Monster a succes, so we hope you can take a few minutes of your time to help us out. Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>
<h3><strong>Update</strong></h3>
<p><em>Before we continue: the first issue of our free animation magazine Animatonic is now online! <a href=""http://issuu.com/magmonster/docs/animatonic?mode=window"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can read it online by clicking here</a>. Just click the link and automatically a magazine reader will open where you can read the mag. This works on any PC, tablet and smartphone.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Another update</strong></h3>
<p><em>We now have zero issues of both <a href=""http://issuu.com/magmonster/docs/heroics_issue_zero"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heroics </a>and <a href=""http://issuu.com/magmonster/docs/tgm_zero"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Touch Gaming Magazine</a> online. Check them out to see what you can expect from the full mags coming soon.</em></p>
<p>My name is Patrick Rijnders, and I made my first magazine with my friends when I was 9. We made one copy of it and went door to door in our neighbourhood, giving neighbours the opportunity to rent the mag for an hour. In case you are wondering: No, it wasn't a big success, but it started my love of magazines. Since then I have worked on dozens of mags, both as hobby and professionally.</p>
<p>Nowadays, over here in Holland (and probably also in other countries), it's difficult to get a job in the magazine business. More and more magazines get cancelled and publishers aren't really looking for people to come working for them. I was laid off when the company I worked for ended up in bad weather, and I haven't been able to work in magazine publishing since.  </p>
<h3><strong>Enter Mag Monster Publishing.</strong></h3>
<p>I decided to take matters into my own hands, and started this company to make the mags that I would love to read, and that I hope other people would like to read as well. I'm doing the editing, designing, part of the writing and making sure the mags get out there. I have a group of friends and ex-colleagues who are helping out by writing articles for me, and this way it's possible to make a magazine once every three weeks or so.</p>
<p>We're starting with three magazines, which are going to be published six times a year: Animatonic, Heroics and Touch Gaming Magazine. We're going to release a special yearbook for each of these three magazines as well, at the end of the year. Since life is expensive enough as it is, we're going to be giving our mags away for free. As we do need money to cover our expenses, we decided to set up this crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<h3><strong>To $ 3000, and beyond!</strong></h3>
<p>We need about $ 3000 to be able to make magazines for a year, and keep them free. This covers all our costs, plus we plan on using the money for a bigger, better website and our own dedicated IOS and Android apps. If we go beyond 3000 dollars, we plan to use the money to make the mags bigger, and to get more people involved so we can make even more magazines.</p>
<h3><strong>Support us for a unique prize!</strong></h3>
<p>For people supporting us, we have a unique offer, since three lucky people supporting us will get:</p>
<p><em>Your own personal digital magazine!</em></p>
<p>That's right, you tell us what you want in this 32 page issue and we make it for you. It can be about anything, as long as it's entertainment related. Do you want a magazine about your favorite actor? No problem. A mag about your favorite band? Obscure 80's shoot-em-ups only released in Japan? Movies starring people with beards? Actresses called Lucy? You name it, we make it. You will act as our editor (though we do have final say) and decide what articles we write. Or we can come up with ideas and you just give us the ok. And when the mag is done, you can do with it what you want. Keep it just for yourself? Sure. Share it with friends and family? Or put it online for everybody to read? You can even try to sell it if you want.</p>
<h3><strong>So, what mags are we going to publish?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Animatonic</strong></h3>

<p>We love animated movies, and if you love them as well this is the mag for you. Inside our pages you will find news, reviews and previews of the latest animated movies, with plenty of attention for the animated classics as well. We cover anything the big studios make but won't stop there. International and independent movies will get plenty of space as well. The first issue of Animatonic is online now, and <a href=""http://issuu.com/magmonster/docs/animatonic?mode=window"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">you can read it here</a>. It has an extensive look at Monsters University, previews of Epic, Turbo and more, reviews of The Croods, Wreck-It Ralph and classic Japanese anime My Neighbour Totoro, among others. We will update this page with info on where you can download it as soon as the mag is online. Issue 2 will be released on July 5th.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Heroics</strong></h3>

<p>Like Animatonic, but then all about superheroes. Superheroes in comics, in movies, on TV and anywhere we can find them. If it's superheroic, we'll cover it! Issue 1 will be released on June 3rd.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Touch Gaming Magazine</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7b3Ln09tX_I/UY41LJq6cVI/AAAAAAAAAB0/ijFAiDxEMJ8/s320/TGMT1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DEaNPQxQ91U/UY41GtTT1kI/AAAAAAAAABk/99gTWbpKtO0/s320/TGMT3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cx4EIlmRZbI/UY41EoriAnI/AAAAAAAAABc/u8lG1N67hdA/s320/TGMT2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We actually already released two issues of Touch Gaming Magazine as an iPad-exclusive magazine two years ago, and now it's back, with news, reviews, previews and interviews, all about gaming on your tablet! We cover IOS, Android and Windows Mobile gaming. The latest issue will be released on June 17th, followed by another issue on Augustus 9th.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Support us and we will keep making magazines for you</strong> </h3>
<p>All the money we make with the mags is going to be spent on making Mag Monster grow. Besides, it will keep us off the streets and doing what makes us happy: Make mags for you! And if we don't reach our goal, that won't be the end for Mag Monster Publishing. We're going to continue to make mags for as long as we can go on.</p>
<h3><strong>A little bit more about me</strong></h3>
<p>Even if you have become interested in reading the magazines, you probably want to know a little bit more about me before you decide to support Mag Monster Publishing. I'm a 40 year old editor from the Netherlands. I'm married, have two kids and have been working in the magazine business for over 20 years. I studied in Amsterdam at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. The study was called Redactie/Productie, which translated means Editing and Producing (magazines and books).</p>
<p>After school I worked for NFL Europe team Amsterdam Admirals, for whom I made all their publications (magazines, newsletters, media guides) for two years. After that I worked as a journalist, working for several local papers and a handful of magazines. I then rolled into magazine publishing, working as editor, deputy editor and writer on literally dozens of magazines and websites, including SF Report, Home Entertainment Today, CompuKids, PC Active, Webber, D-Zone, DVD World and many, many more. During my later years I also worked as translator, translating UK magazines for the Dutch market.</p>
<p>Next to my full-time jobs, I have tried my hand at doing my own thing several times. I was co-founder and editor of one of the first Dutch websites on gaming, GameNed, as well as editor and head writer for movie website Movie Scribblings. I had a website about animation called Animated Chatter and launched Touch Gaming Magazine and Animatonic two years ago. Throughout those years I have worked with many talented writers, several of whom will be working with me on the Mag Monster magazines.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Wait!</strong></h3>
<p>Oh, you want more info on our special prizes? Yes, when this crowdfunder has reached it's end, we will pick three names out of all the people who supported us, no matter which perk you chose, and then we will work together on making something fantastic. For the record though: We won't make anything with hate, pornography and all that other nasty stuff you really don't want to read about.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So?</strong></p>
<p>I hope this has convinced you to support Mag Monster Publishing. I want nothing more than to make great mags for you. So please support us and let your friends and family know about us :)</p></div>","Help us make great digital magazines!

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Short Summary</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My name is Barbara Bacca. I have
worked as a freelance translator for 20 years. I am currently writing my PhD
dissertation about censored poetry in the former German Democratic Republic. Writing has always been one of my great passions. I have written stories and poems for about 25 years, out of pure passion. I don't want to leave them sitting in old diaries, in binders, or left to die inside a file, if they can serve a purpose. </p>

My dream is to create a
website to raise awareness of sharing, compassion, and respect for every living
being as the moral duty of every person and a priceless opportunity for human
and social growth. This website will have a section for informational and news
articles on the subject as well as an e-shop to sell previously unpublished
e-books and audiobooks of stories, poems, and meditative writings on various
topics, written by me. <span>The topics of my writings are very diverse, but they are
developed in the spirit of the ideals that are the life of my project.</span><p></p>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<p><b>OBJECTIVES
OF THE PROJECT:</b></p>
<p><b>a)</b> 51% of the proceeds from the sale of every item will be donated to a
non-profit association that gives aid and protection to the needy or to animals. Each
customer can choose from a list of associations to decide where his or her
donation will go. </p>
<p>Each e-book
and audio book will be translated and sold in at least 6 languages: English,
French, German, Italian, Russian, and Spanish.</p>
<p>The website
will include a discussion and informational blog, as well as a page that
provides updates on the activities of the associations that receive donations, as
well as complete information on the associations themselves.</p>
<p>Each title
will have a unit price of $1.99 to $3.99. 51% of this amount will be donated to the
association chosen by the customer. </p>
<p>The
remaining sum will largely go to cover costs to maintain and update the site,
to organize awareness events, and for the translation and creation of new
e-books and audiobooks.</p>
<p><b>b) </b>Along with providing material aid to these associations, there is also a
mental and spiritual objective. The message that I want to communicate and foster
is that the hierarchical classification of suffering according to the being who
is victimized is a castration and a debasement of our potential for human
growth. Life is precious in any form, and the suffering of living beings is
always a tragedy, whether translated to a yelp or sobs – a tragedy that we can
help prevent and cure. My initiative will certainly not change the world, but I
am convinced that it can plant a little seed: to draw attention to the suffering
of the weakest and most defenseless creatures, to encourage people to respond
to their needs, to want to study and get to know about worlds and contexts that
they never paid attention to before.</p>
<p>The primary
objective of this project is not my personal gain, because we can never be
fully satisfied with our lives if we don't contribute to improve the world
outside of our door. To free one's self from the “none of my business”
mentality is the one unfailing way to a healthy and complete happiness.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>WHY I NEED YOUR SUPPORT:</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I have set my fundraising goal at $6,000 but this is an ongoing project. Please,
help me meet my initial goal. </p>
<p>A short breakdown of the estimated costs:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>$500 - logo design<br/>
$950 - website (blog and e-shop included)<br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">$2,800 - Translation
and proofreading of the first 4 titles<br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">$1,000 - e-books creation + audiobooks recording<br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">$300 - perks<br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">7% + $25.00 - Indiegogo and credit card fees </span></p>

<p><b>My engagement</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">In 2008, I watched a TV program
that told of the terrible fate of little Oscar, a stray puppy who was beaten,
tortured, sodomized, and buried alive by a group of boys. Oscar died a few days
later from the terrible injuries he had suffered. For me, it was an enormous
shock. Through this tragic episode, I discovered a world of pain and atrocity:
homeless animals, vivisection, zooerasty, factory farming, exploitation of animals
– for food or not – and the grave indifference of humans to the tragedies of
the animal world. </span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">The story of Oscar changed my life forever: at times it is more bitter, since the injustices and cruelties I am aware of are infinitely greater, but my life is also more rich with moments of joy, since I have developed the capacity to observe the world on a microscopic scale, taking in the beauty and the value of life in all its forms, and experiencing the joy of respecting it and becoming familiar with it. The compensation for this tenderness is unimaginable, and I want everyone to discover it. It is an experience that can't help but grab hold of your heart. By the end of January 2014 I am going to found</span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""> a voluntary, non-profit association, Humanimalize, which I intend to use
to build a worldwide network of people to introduce the mindset and deep human
and social values of being open to every form of life, in the most diverse environments,
and through training events, conferences, awareness demonstrations, and
initiatives for voluntary aid to the needy. The project was created in a few
days, but everyone involved is very excited about its potential.</span></p>
<p>At present I do my best to spread the concept of compassion also through my radio show, “L’Urlo
Animale <span>(The Animal Cry),” broadcast every week on the
non-profit Italian web radio site </span><a href=""http://www.radiolivemusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.radiolivemusic.com</a>, my blog at <a href=""http://www.barbarabacca.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.barbarabacca.com</a>, and the

<p><b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Why do I
think that people with different objectives meeting on one site has social benefits?</b><br/></p>
<p>Some of the
most severe problems afflicting the world come from irresponsible extremism. This
includes the inclination to give protection based on sterile and discriminating
criteria, specifically: disdain for animal rights activists by those who say we
should be caring for people instead of animals, and some fringe elements of the
animal rights movement who claim that animals are superior to humans. In this
case as well, the middle path is the virtuous one. All extremism leads to a
dangerous blindness, and takes energy away from what, in my humble opinion, is the
only healthy battle: the fight for compassion without limits. What hinders this
is the tendency to handle diversity with an instinct to separation and
classification. But innocence, fragility, and the need for love and respect are
not only for some categories of being, but for all living beings.</p>
<p>I believe and
hope that bringing the world of humans closer to the world of animals and vice versa will
encourage visitors to wonder about the reasons for such a joining, and perhaps
to question their own personal classifications. The blog should then encourage
and welcome helpful discussions, in the spirit of solidarity that the site
should inspire in its visitors.</p>
<p>Hostility
and fear are often the result of a lack of knowledge, or even of suffering. I would
like to bring people together to encourage understanding and contribute to
creating moments that enrich the givers at least as much as the associations to
which they donate.</p>
Over time, I have come to understand
that the highest gift a human being can receive is compassion;
a gift that is instilled and cultivated through attention to the most needy and
defenseless creatures. Helping, understanding, and loving without discrimination
makes us better, more mature, sensitive, and empathic human beings.<p></p>

My name is Barbara Bacca. I have
worked as a freelance translator for 20 years. I am currently writing my PhD
dissertation about censored poetry in the former German Democratic Republic. Writing has always been one of my great passions. I have written stories and poems for about 25 years, out of pure passion. I don't want to leave them sitting in old diaries, in binders, or left to die inside a file, if they can serve a purpose. 

My dream is to create a
website to raise awareness of sharing, compassion, and respect for every living
being as the moral duty of every person and a priceless opportunity for human
and social growth. This website will have a section for informational and news
articles on the subject as well as an e-shop to sell previously unpublished
e-books and audiobooks of stories, poems, and meditative writings on various
topics, written by me. The topics of my writings are very diverse, but they are
developed in the spirit of the ideals that are the life of my project.


OBJECTIVES
OF THE PROJECT:
a) 51% of the proceeds from the sale of every item will be donated to a
non-profit association that gives aid and protection to the needy or to animals. Each
customer can choose from a list of associations to decide where his or her
donation will go. 
Each e-book
and audio book will be translated and sold in at least 6 languages: English,
French, German, Italian, Russian, and Spanish.
The website
will include a discussion and informational blog, as well as a page that
provides updates on the activities of the associations that receive donations, as
well as complete information on the associations themselves.
Each title
will have a unit price of $1.99 to $3.99. 51% of this amount will be donated to the
association chosen by the customer. 
The
remaining sum will largely go to cover costs to maintain and update the site,
to organize awareness events, and for the translation and creation of new
e-books and audiobooks.
b) Along with providing material aid to these associations, there is also a
mental and spiritual objective. The message that I want to communicate and foster
is that the hierarchical classification of suffering according to the being who
is victimized is a castration and a debasement of our potential for human
growth. Life is precious in any form, and the suffering of living beings is
always a tragedy, whether translated to a yelp or sobs – a tragedy that we can
help prevent and cure. My initiative will certainly not change the world, but I
am convinced that it can plant a little seed: to draw attention to the suffering
of the weakest and most defenseless creatures, to encourage people to respond
to their needs, to want to study and get to know about worlds and contexts that
they never paid attention to before.
The primary
objective of this project is not my personal gain, because we can never be
fully satisfied with our lives if we don't contribute to improve the world
outside of our door. To free one's self from the “none of my business”
mentality is the one unfailing way to a healthy and complete happiness.

WHY I NEED YOUR SUPPORT:


I have set my fundraising goal at $6,000 but this is an ongoing project. Please,
help me meet my initial goal. 
A short breakdown of the estimated costs:


$500 - logo design
$950 - website (blog and e-shop included)$2,800 - Translation
and proofreading of the first 4 titles$1,000 - e-books creation + audiobooks recording$300 - perks7% + $25.00 - Indiegogo and credit card fees 

My stretch (middle) goal is $7,000. Help me hit that goal and I can cover all the fees and production & shipping costs and fund the Russian translation + the relevant e-books and audio books creation.

The compensation for this tenderness is unimaginable, and I want everyone to discover it. It is an experience that can't help but grab hold of your heart. By the end of January 2014 I am going to found a voluntary, non-profit association, Humanimalize, which I intend to use
to build a worldwide network of people to introduce the mindset and deep human
and social values of being open to every form of life, in the most diverse environments,
and through training events, conferences, awareness demonstrations, and

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there. My name's Adrien Leduc, I'm 25 years old, and I want to put 25 copies of my book, The Dumnonian Hoard, into 25 children's hospitals and Ronald McDonald Houses across Canada and the U.S.</p>
<p>As a kid I loved reading. Adventure stories like those written by Enid Blyton. Hardy Boys. Harry Potter. Sigmund Brouwer. The Redwall series. Those great paperbacks you see at school book fairs and the ones you'd get as a gift from your teacher if you excelled at something. Creativity, imagination, making Disney moments in real life - that's what I'm all about and reading is a huge part of that.</p>
<p>In 1998, at the age of 11, I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. I spent a week in hospital and ever since, have been going to doctors, specialists and hospitals for check ups. For a young boy these trips can be frightening and intimidating. What made these trips tolerable was being able to read good books while there.</p>
<p>Kids going through tough things like diabetes, cancer and other illnesses should have access to books. Books take you places. Inspire you. Fuel your imagination and creativity. Even moreso for a child.</p>
<p>I've always felt an affinity for children - especially sick ones - and I feel like I have an opportunity to give back.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>A friend took the above video this summer when I was in Tokyo, but I never dreamed I'd be using it here.</p>
<p>Whenever people ask what I do for a living and I tell them I'm a travel writer, I always get the same reaction: ""I wish I had your job!"" While it's true that it has been an incredible ride and more than I ever imagined growing up in Kansas, I always tell people that the downside is money. I have been earning a living as a travel writer for more than 3 decades, first while living in Germany and hitchhiking everywhere I went and then driving my old beat-up Datsun from Canada to the Yucatan, selling my travel articles to newspapers across the US. I then moved to Tokyo in the mid-1980s and worked for a couple years as editor of a travel magazine. It was then that <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Frommer's</span> contacted me about writing a guide book on both Japan and Hong Kong (it was to be their first venture in Asia). So I spent a year working on the project, six months traveling and six months writing. They paid me $7,000 for my efforts, and I made up the difference with my personal savings. <br/></p>
<p>With a few exceptions when I was able to pick up extra well-paying assignments, I have lived below the poverty line ever since. It has been a conscious choice, because I am doing what I love. Over the years I have written or contributed to more than a dozen guide books (mostly Frommer's), and while they never paid much money, they at least kept me afloat if I added smaller assignments along the way. By living frugally and living below my means (I am a single mom and we live without 
air-conditioning or cable TV in a 1890s house I bought years ago for 
$90,000), I have been able to make it work. </p>
<p>Since 2008, however, and what the Japanese call the ""Lehman Shock,"" many of my usual markets have dried up (including <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Frommer's USA</span>, for which I covered Midwestern cities, and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Frommer's Europe by Rail</span>, for which I covered Germany and Austria). My Japan book long ago morphed into three books: <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Frommer's Japan</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Frommer's Tokyo</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Frommer's Hong Kong</span>, all of which I update every two years and are now the bulk of what I do. Because the payments I receive to update them are so low; because--and this is the part that floors everyone--I am responsible for <span style=""font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"">all my own travel expenses</span>, and because my books are so time-intensive from start to finish, my guides pretty much ensure that my annual earnings are less than for a high-school graduate.  <br/></p>
<p>Of course, then came the most terrifying natural disaster in my lifetime--the March 11 earthquake off the Tohoku coast of Japan, unleashing that massive wall of water that swept over villages, farms and people and in one instant changed absolutely everything in Japan. I have traveled so often along that coastline, that the triple disaster of earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown seemed like it was happening right in my backyard. I had been planning to go to Tokyo in mid-March to update that guide book, but after the US travel advisory against traveling to Japan (which did more harm to Japan than good), the dramatic departure of foreigners, power blackouts and uncertainty of a nuclear radiation, I didn't make it there until May.The overwhelming message I hear from those who run small inns, hotels, restaurants, shops, and bars, is that the dramatic decrease in foreign visitors has been hurting them more than they'd ever imagined. Japan has always been a tough sell--expensive, far away, inscrutable in language and customs--but fears of earthquake and nuclear radiation have reduced tourism to historic lows. While no one has forgotten the disaster and never will, today it's the economy that dominates people's thoughts in Japan.<br/></p>
<p>Japan needs travel writers and visitors more than ever. The kicker is that Japan has never been as expensive as it is now. The dollar has fallen 25% against the yen the past two years and is 40% less than it was 4 years ago. The result is that what was previously simply poverty wages for me has now become impossible wages. Although I get some help from the Japan National Tourism Organization (mostly rail passes) for which I'm very grateful, I have always paid for the bulk of my travels, including my flight to Japan, meals, buses, local transportation, admission to museums and attractions, and accommodations. For many years, I've felt that I've been promoting Japan entirely on my own.<br/></p>
<p>But now, with decreased tourism and more than two decades of a 
depressed economy, Japan needs more than I can give. After running the 
numbers and trying to create a budget, I realized that unless I 
couch-surf (difficult at my age, let alone the size of Japanese 
apartments) or use money I've saved for retirement, there is no way I 
can pay for the seven months required to update <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Frommer's Japan</span>. <br/></p>That
 is why, for the first time, I am appealing to others to help make this 
book possible, including those who may not be traveling to Japan any 
time soon but would like to help in some tangible way. I feel that this 
is bigger than just me.</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since October I have been working on the 11th edition of Frommer's Japan; my deadline is May 1. In that time I will make sure that every single fact in the 650-page book is updated. I just completed one month of travel in Japan, mostly to southern Honshu (places like Osaka, Himeji, Matsue, Hiroshima, Miyajima, and seven cities in Kyushu. I then flew north to Tohoku for my first trip to Hiraizumi, declared a World Heritage Site shortly after the earthquake; it's located in Iwate Prefecture, one of the hardest hit prefectures from the earthquake and tsunami. </p>
<p>Without trying to sound boastful, I cannot overemphasize what an impact <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Frommer's Japan</span> has on the cities it covers. Many people travel to destinations only covered in my guide, perhaps because travel in Japan is harder than in some other countries due to the language barrier. Because I am what one editor called ""old school,"" I cover places in my book personally and rely on local recommendations for hotels, restaurants, etc., rather than the Internet or other guide books, and try to be fair in my reporting. I know that travelers depend on my information being correct; a bad guide book can ruin a vacation. <br/></p>
<p>But it's hard doing justice to Japan, my readers, and myself when I'm limited because of finances. Of course, if I can't afford to continue doing the work I love, Frommer's can hire someone else to do it, since they own all the rights to my words. Someday, of course, I'll have to turn the reins over to someone younger, but I don't think now--when this guide book, already postponed, needs to come out as quickly as possible--is the time, not to mention that I have already given up so much financially to write and update these guides, it doesn't seem fair that in the end it's lack of money that prevents me from continuing. It doesn't seem fair that only people with an independent source of money or no financial obligations (house, kids) can afford to be travel writers. <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need to Update the Japan Guide</h3>
<p>I'm being paid $24,000 for the Japan guide. $6,000 goes to an assistant I send to other parts of Japan, leaving me $18,000 to travel one month in Japan and live on until my May 1 deadline. The kicker, however, is that I get only half of the $24,000 as an advance. Since $12,000 is obviously impossible, I am adding $5,000 from my final payment for Frommer's Tokyo to make it through. <br/></p>
<p>The budget I've come up with for $17,000 gives me:</p>
<p> 1. $12,500 in living expenses from October until May (not quite $1,800 a month; obviously too low since my mortgage and self-employed health insurance total almost $1,500 a month, but I hope to augment it with other work when possible). As a single mother, I cannot jeopardize my children's welfare by going any lower on this amount.<br/></p>
<p>2. $3,000 to an assistant (another $3,000 will be paid after our work is done and I get the second $12,000)<br/></p>
<p>3. $1,500 for my flight to Osaka last month<br/></p>
<p>4. ZERO money for my month of travel in Japan<br/></p>
<p>In other words, not only does the guide fail to earn enough to live on, but it also leaves me nothing left over to actually go to Japan to do the job.    <br/></p>
<p>During the month I just traveled in Japan, I spent less money than I ever have--just $2,000 (usually I spend $3,000). Everywhere I went, local tourist offices stepped up to the plate by showing me around (and usually buying my lunch and admission to local museums and sights); and some hotels and Japanese inns offered me a free room (some of them have been in my book for 10 or 20 years). Local prefectural tourist offices were so eager to show me new places (often smaller towns in the vicinity), I ended up working extra hard just to carve out a few extra hours for the new things. I worked 30 days straight without a day off, usually 10 hours a day. I usually left my hotel at 9am, returned around 7 or 8pm after a full day of walking and researching, and then spent the evening sorting brochures and notes, ansering emails, and planning for my next destination (I decided if I had to work that hard the rest of my life, I'd probably kill myself). <br/></p>
<p>The bulk of my money spent in Japan went toward meals, hotels, and local transportation. To put things in perspective, a dormitory bed in a youth hostel costs about $41, a local bus ride costs $4, and the cheapest lunch special around $11 to $12. I, however, paid about $70 to stay at hotels I recommend in my book (and believe me, that was a bargain) and often paid $30 for dinner in my recommended ""budget"" restaurants. Sometimes I skipped lunch altogether; sometimes I had a rice bowl ($7) in a cheap fast-food restaurant instead of eating in one of my recommended restaurants (ideally I would actually eat at all the restaurants in my book every single edition, but that would cost far more than the $24,000 I earn for the guide). <br/></p>
<p>In any case, due to the wonderful contributions from friends for this campaign (you guys rock!), I had to come up with just $1,200 of my own money for the trip, plus extra to make it through these first few months (I picked up one small writing job while on the road and just pitched another but it will be a while before I get paid for either). To do so, I had to pull $2,000 from my retirement account.</p>
<p>While it was fun but exhausting on the road, I now have the biggest bulk of my work ahead of me, including writing up all those new places I visited. I also got word this week that all Frommer's books are being revamped to make them more online friendly--certainly necessary, but a helluva lot of work for authors (without any additional pay). <br/></p>I will get the second half of my Japan guide book payment in June or July, but by then I'll be working on Hong Kong, and because I'm not paid enough upfront for that guide either (about $6,000 for four months of work and three weeks in Hong Kong), I always have to use my Japan payment to last see me through that (just like I'm using Tokyo guide money to help me through the Japan book), and of course I'll also owe the assistant another $3,000. <br/><p>In any case, this budget is all bare bones, so living on the edge, I can only hope that something unforeseen doesn't happen, like a car breakdown or a heater out, because there is no wiggle room in this budget. On the other hand, I'm used to living on the edge. <br/></p>
<p>If you believe that Japan needs tourists now more than ever and that I should not personally go in the hole to update this edition of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Frommer's Japan</span>, I hope you will consider contributing if you can. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

3. $1,500 for my flight to Osaka last month
4. ZERO money for my month of travel in Japan
In other words, not only does the guide fail to earn enough to live on, but it also leaves me nothing left over to actually go to Japan to do the job.    
During the month I just traveled in Japan, I spent less money than I ever have--just $2,000 (usually I spend $3,000). Everywhere I went, local tourist offices stepped up to the plate by showing me around (and usually buying my lunch and admission to local museums and sights); and some hotels and Japanese inns offered me a free room (some of them have been in my book for 10 or 20 years). Local prefectural tourist offices were so eager to show me new places (often smaller towns in the vicinity), I ended up working extra hard just to carve out a few extra hours for the new things. I worked 30 days straight without a day off, usually 10 hours a day. I usually left my hotel at 9am, returned around 7 or 8pm after a full day of walking and researching, and then spent the evening sorting brochures and notes, ansering emails, and planning for my next destination (I decided if I had to work that hard the rest of my life, I'd probably kill myself). 
The bulk of my money spent in Japan went toward meals, hotels, and local transportation. To put things in perspective, a dormitory bed in a youth hostel costs about $41, a local bus ride costs $4, and the cheapest lunch special around $11 to $12. I, however, paid about $70 to stay at hotels I recommend in my book (and believe me, that was a bargain) and often paid $30 for dinner in my recommended ""budget"" restaurants. Sometimes I skipped lunch altogether; sometimes I had a rice bowl ($7) in a cheap fast-food restaurant instead of eating in one of my recommended restaurants (ideally I would actually eat at all the restaurants in my book every single edition, but that would cost far more than the $24,000 I earn for the guide). 
In any case, due to the wonderful contributions from friends for this campaign (you guys rock!), I had to come up with just $1,200 of my own money for the trip, plus extra to make it through these first few months (I picked up one small writing job while on the road and just pitched another but it will be a while before I get paid for either). To do so, I had to pull $2,000 from my retirement account.
While it was fun but exhausting on the road, I now have the biggest bulk of my work ahead of me, including writing up all those new places I visited. I also got word this week that all Frommer's books are being revamped to make them more online friendly--certainly necessary, but a helluva lot of work for authors (without any additional pay). I will get the second half of my Japan guide book payment in June or July, but by then I'll be working on Hong Kong, and because I'm not paid enough upfront for that guide either (about $6,000 for four months of work and three weeks in Hong Kong), I always have to use my Japan payment to last see me through that (just like I'm using Tokyo guide money to help me through the Japan book), and of course I'll also owe the assistant another $3,000. In any case, this budget is all bare bones, so living on the edge, I can only hope that something unforeseen doesn't happen, like a car breakdown or a heater out, because there is no wiggle room in this budget. On the other hand, I'm used to living on the edge. 
If you believe that Japan needs tourists now more than ever and that I should not personally go in the hole to update this edition of Frommer's Japan, I hope you will consider contributing if you can.

<div>
<p>My name is Tim Joseph.  Like most people I know, after many years of being a couch potato and letting myself go I was terribly out of shape.  I would go to work and come home and sit and watch TV while I snacked.  With three kids I often had trouble keeping up with them during physical activities and would often sit on the side and just watch them.  I got tired of being so out of shape and decided to do something about it.  So I went on a diet and lost 50 pounds.  Losing the weight was fantastic, however, I realized sadly that even though I was now thin, I was still out of shape.  We all know how easy (and fairly inexpensive) it is these days to join a gym and work out.  My problem was that, like 85% of people who buy gym memberships, I never went.  With my work and family schedules, I honestly did not have time to drive to a gym, workout and drive home.  I ended up reading a lot about fitness and health and came up with a plan that I could do at home that I didn't have to dedicate much time to.  I started small and simple, and was able to increase the amount of each exercise I was able to do.  I started with 25 push ups per day and increased my number to 90 per day in less than four weeks.  The best part is that it didn't interrupt my life in any way.</p>
<p>With your help I will be able to author a kindle book that outlines my plan.  I will show you and many others how you to can build strength and become physically fit the same way I did.  My plan isn't a laundry list of what you should be doing and when, but rather how to custom tailor a workout program that fits into your life without getting in the way, all while being efficient and building muscle.</p>
<p>With your contribution you will not only be investing in me and in my dream but also in the lives of many others who will discover my kindle book in the future.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm looking for $750 to fund my project.  I plan to use the money for research materials and possibly to hire a trainer to contribute.  I want to add some real science and knowledge to my kindle book and give it some credibility.  It isn't enough to talk about my plan in my opinion.  I want people to have a real understanding of the body and how muscle growth works.</p>
<p>Second, I plan to use some of this money to market my kindle book so it will be successful and you will know your contribution wasn't wasted.  I am connected with people who are very skilled at internet marketing and some of the money raised will go towards paying them to further the success of my kindle book and get it into as many hands as possible.</p>
<p>Even if my total goal is not reached, the funds you contribute will still go to the same efforts to get my kindle book written and published and I will do the best job I can with the funds raised to write the most complete book possible.</p>
<p>Everyone who contributes will receive an advanced copy of the ebook.</p>
<p>At $10 you will receive a copy of the ebook as well as a personal thank you with your name or the name of someone else (at your request) in the book.</p>
<p>At $20 you will receive the previous rewards, plus workout advice via email.  I'll keep it personalized and do my best to stick with you until your routine is in cruise control.</p>
<p>At $100 you will receive all the above things plus a phone call from me thanking you personally.  If you are in the Orlando, FL area, I'd happily meet you for coffee and thank you in person.</p>
<p>At $1000 (we can dream can't we?), I'll give you all previously mentioned gifts plus personalized training next time you're in Orlando, FL.  Not planning to come here? I'll at least send you a pretty awesome post card!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<p>I believe in my project and know it holds value because it could potentially help thousands of people get themselves into shape and stay in shape with very little effort.  All it takes is a decision, a plan and a commitment to yourself.  Not only I have been successful at getting myself into shape with this plan, but I've also helped a friend of mine use my plan to get himself into shape as well.  Though I'll be the one writing the book, you will be able to know that you are paying it forward and helping others as well.</p>
<p><strong>If You Can't</strong></p>
<p>I understand that everyone can't contribute.  I've been there before.  I've seen really good projects that I wanted to give money to but at times the money just isn't there.  If you're not able to give you can share.  Share this page on your facebook or twitter.  Maybe you have a blog and need something to write about.  You'd be doing a favor for not only me, but also the future readers and the other contributors as well, if you share.</p>
<p>And hey, if your friends get the ebook maybe they'll let you borrow it sometime.</p>

<p>Thanks to your help, I will be

create, and weave together. <b>I will use those stories in programs here to build understanding and spark

<p><b>Please, help me foster healing and peace between us</b>, all God’s

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b>With your help, I’ve met my first goal: half the cost</b> of getting to Israel and participating
in this two-week visit. That’s the bare minimum for me to make this a reality,
and it doesn’t fully cover my costs while I am there – just a meal or two a day and
lodging.</p>
<p><b>But of course the work doesn’t stop there.</b> I’ll be recording – with

<h3>Risks </h3>
<p><b>Honestly, your risks are nil.</b> Spiritual storytelling, sparking transformation in others, is the air I

In 2012, I self-published a book called <em>Vintage California Cuisine</em>, about the history of California cooking, featuring 300 recipes from some of the first cookbooks published in the state. It was critically acclaimed, in the <em>San Francisco Weekly</em> and elsewhere, but it hasn’t exactly flown off the shelves. In fact, I’m still well short of getting my out-of-pocket expenditures back. Oh well. I’m determined to publish a similar, second book anyway, called <em>Vintage Vegetarian Cuisine</em>. This book, which I have been researching ever since the first book came out, is about the fascinating history of vegetarianism, as reflected in a dozen early vegetarian cookbooks and their visionary, and in some cases wonderfully eccentric, authors. The earliest of the cookbooks that I’ll be covering was published in England in 1699. The most recent was published in Illinois in 1931. I’ll tell the story behind each book, illustrated with a representative selection of 300 old recipes, reprinted verbatim. To complete the project, I need to hire an illustrator and pay printing costs. Those of you who support this project will be the first to get a copy, fresh off the press, and my deep gratitude, to boot.</div>","I am a writer with a special interest in history and food.

<h3>Who I am</h3>
<p>I am a writer, journalist, researcher, living in southwest Florida.  About ten years ago, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and it seemed as if my life as a wordsmith had been ended.  In many ways, it had because I was forced to surrender my full-time work life.  Truth is, I was professionally incapacitated because I could no longer read, let alone write.</p>
<p>Life has changed a lot since—I’ve accepted my limitations and worked on developing my “new self” into a different kind writer.  I owe the first step in my recovery to Florida writer Carl Hiaasen, though he doesn’t know it, and a wonderful occupation therapist, who insisted I learn to read and started me with a copy of Hiaasen’s Sick Puppy.  I did learn, starting with recognizing letters to formulating words and fluent reading.  Most importantly, I was, instinctively, set back on my own path as a writer—a new path, with a new voice. My collection of stories, <strong>Saint Gabriel’s Girls</strong>, along with other recent writings, is a reflection of that accomplishment.</p>
<p>I hope you will support my efforts, not because I’ve laid out a sad personal narrative.  I am a happy woman because I live an awesome life!  Your support will allow me to engage the professional services needed to put together a literary product of merit.  I believe in the stories of <strong>Saint Gabriel’s Girls</strong>.  I hope you will, too.</p>
<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>Saint Gabriel’s Girls is a collection of three stories, Changed Names; Still Wrong, Goosefarm, and Background Music. Together they are a story of friendship between four girls and classmates at a Catholic Boarding School in New Jersey—Girl-X, Holland, Concetta, and Aoife.  Yes, four girls and just three stories because, as Girl-X tells us, “Aoife is not present.”</p>
<p>Separately, each story reveals the secret school-aged life of each girl—and how these friends’ adulthoods are broken because or in spite of them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>This fundraiser will cover the costs of the following services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proofreading (Big deal)</li>
<li>Editing (Bigger deal)</li>
<li>Cover art</li>
<li>Music royalties for promotional materials</li>
</ul>
<p>If the funding goal is not met, all monetary support will go toward the cost of editing services.  I will be happy to share all expenses covered under this funding as the project progresses.</p>

<h3>Who I Am</h3>
<p>I am the author of <em>The Virgin Diaries</em> and <em>Ain't No Sunshine: Men Reveal the Pain of Heartbreak.</em> In the spring of 2012, I had the opportunity to fight the War On Women as the spokeswoman for RTSV United. The We Are Woman March in Washington D.C. afforded me the opportunity to give a speech on women’s rights on the west lawn of the Capitol Building, where I was interviewed on camera for Al Jazeera English and by Kamala Lopez for a documentary about ratifying the ERA.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>As yet untitled, this work in progress is dedicated to women’s rights and equality with an emphasis on the importance of voting. 2012 served to awaken feminists of all ages and genders. The intent of the author is to educate, motivate and inspire women, particularly young women, for they are the future and yet are among the most uninformed.</p>
<p>The 2012 election year was rife with politicians attacking reproductive issues, fair pay and equality. As RTSV spokeswoman and political blogger, I wrote about the issues and used my platform to insure that both genders were aware and could make informed decisions in the voting booth. Along the way, I received positive feedback and emails from men and women of all ages and backgrounds, thanking me for my voice and encouraging me to keep going.<br/> <br/>I wish to share some of my experiences and insights, utilizing humor as well as providing information. The goal is to write a book that will appeal to youth and avoid a dry, textbook style approach. Humorous, shocking, inspiring, informative and encouraging are adjectives that aptly describe the book’s intent.<br/> <br/>The mission is to release the book in the months before the 2014 midterm elections as well as making it widely available before the next presidential election in 2016 to achieve maximum impact.</p>

<h3>Welcome to Bodhi Mind</h3>
<p>My name's Bodhipaksa. I teach meditation, mostly through my website, <a href=""http://www.wildmind.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wildmind</a>. My guided meditations are highly acclaimed. People say that my style is gentle, clear, practical, and effective.</p>
<p>(If you're not familiar with my meditation teaching, you can <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/wildmind/letting-go-of-thinking"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">check out this example on SoundCloud</a>.)</p>
<p>I've been teaching meditation for 28 years, and since 2000 I've been leveraging technology in order to bring mindfulness and compassion to a global audience — particularly for people who have difficulty accessing traditional face-to-face meditation classes.</p>
<p>It's time for me to develop an app.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.wildmind.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Wildmind</a><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> is an enormously popular website, with one and a half million visitors each year. Through Wildmind, I've literally taught meditation to millions of people in every country in the world that has access to the internet — from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, and from Zambia to Albania.</span></p>
<p>My online courses, which were launched in 2001, were (I believe) the first to teach meditation online. I've also published CDs, MP3s, and audiobooks, and taught meditation using videoconferencing technology.</p>
<p>Over the time I've been doing all this, the technological landscape has changed radically, requiring constant adaptation but also offering new opportunities. My first online streaming meditations had to work around the fact that virtually everyone using them was on dialup, and at one point I was publishing meditations on audiocassette. CDs exploded in popularity, and then declined, only for MP3s to become the standard way to listen to guided meditations. The mobile device has now become the most common way to access the web, displacing cumbersome desktop machines.</p>
<p>The popularity of mobile phones and tablets means that we are now in the age of the app, and Wildmind is ready to take the next step.</p>
<p>This summer, we plan to launch the Bodhi Mind meditation app, for iPhone.</p>
<h3>About the App</h3>
<p>Bodhi Mind <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>will become the main way to access my teachings.</span></p>
<p>It's a subscription iPhone app, offering mobile users a large library of my guided meditations. This will include all meditation CDs and MP3s that Wildmind has published since 2001, including those developed for our online courses. At present that means that something like 200 guided meditations will be available, all in one app. The app will also include recordings of live meditation classes that I've led.</p>
<p>And what's available at the time that the app launches is just the start. Everything I publish through Wildmind from now on will become part of the app, meaning that the library of what's available will constantly expand.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>These meditations range from one-minute micro-meditations to sessions almost an hour in length, from introductory practices to more advanced</span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> meditations aimed at the experienced practitioner who aims to develop insight.</span></p>
<p>There will be stand-alone meditations as well as series of progressive practices. You'll be able to browse meditations depending on what you're looking for. Want to reduce anxiety? You'll be able to access many practices designed to help you deal with difficult feelings. Want to overcome self-judgement or shame? We'll have a ton of meditations to help you do that. </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>You'll be able to create a list of favorite tracks. You can stream the tracks online, or will be able to download them for offline listening. The app will show you how many times each track has been played, and you'll be alerted to meditations that have been added recently.</span></p>
<p>Although the app will be free, full functionality will be available only to subscribers. (Free users will have access to a limited selection of meditations).</p>
<p>The costs of a subscription giving full access is just $4.99 a month, which is tremendous value for an app offering so many guided meditations.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To develop the app we need at least $8,750. </p>
<ul>
<li>$3,750 will pay for the graphic and user experience design costs,</li>
<li>The remaining $5,000 will cover the fees for designing the software that the app runs on.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we raise more than our $8,750 target, the surplus will be used to host and maintain the app, create new content, and support the development of future versions, including the possible creation of an Android app.</p>
<p>Most of our perks give you early subscription to the app at a discounted rate. Higher perks also include swag such as signed books, t-shirts, and mugs.</p>
<p>We also have perks for fans who are Android users (who can't of course benefit from the app subscriptions). These include coupons to download meditation MP3s from our online store.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting our project, you help us bring the benefits of meditation to an even wider audience than we currently reach.</p>
<p>In contributing to our campaign you're not supporting a large corporation, like some of the other apps available out there, but a small, dedicated team, focused around a teacher whose life-work is to help people become happier.</p>
<p>We plan to use the financial stability that this app will bring to Wildmind in order focus on deepening our practice, so that we have more to offer the world. We also aim to spend more of our time on pro bono teaching, helping populations such as school children, people with disabilities, and prison inmates.</p>

My name's Bodhipaksa. I teach meditation, mostly through my website, Wildmind. My guided meditations are highly acclaimed. People say that my style is gentle, clear, practical, and effective.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a Sheffield based, feminist magazine celebrating women and creativity.</p>We have almost finished editing our third issue which is full of incredible illustrations, photographs, poems and non fiction. We want to continue showcasing the work of talented feminists and believe that we have built a strong relationship with our readers, contributors and the shops of Sheffield. Wanda number three will be our strongest issue yet!<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div><p>We need help with printing and shipping costs. We one day aim to fund ourselves, but for now all donations will be greatly appreciated. As well as a shout out in the mag there is also the chance to get a copy of the mag in the post, and if you claim our biggest reward you will receive some official Wanda goodies too!</p></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We've received submissions from both female and male identifying artists in the past and believe we have successfully created an inclusive space for people to share their work which was something we were adamant about from the start.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>When you have the label of 'feminist magazine' people can sometimes react a little sourly, but we're used to explaining we are not printing anti-men propaganda, and simply celebrating women and creativity while discussing issues that matter to us.

It will allow them to expand their professions, see new horizons in creating income and expand in markets  That is why I say: This book is going to be published no matter what!<br/><br/>Additionally, 3% from the money collected here will go to an organization about abandoned, dissapeard and/or single parent families poor children (<a href=""http://www.kivotostoukosmou.org/kivotos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.kivotostoukosmou.org/kivotos/</a>).

Add to this expenses for Content Reviewing, Translations, Editing and images processing (as there are images for all the steps for learning SEO, Adwords, Analytics, Influential Metrics, Social Media practices, Search Engines logic).</p>
<p>Practically, expenses cover 3rd party work which I do not know how to do.</p>
<p><strong>Your contribution will go to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing. Marketing budget is also needed. I can build blogs, sites, campaigns but money to spent are really necessary. Google is not free, Social Media need dedication of time and efforts.</li>

<li>ISBN, copyrights.</li>
<li>Additional copies of the book to send to education institutes, universities, colleges, etc</li>
<li>As you know, a book takes time to be written properly, no matter how expert one is in his field. This time needs to be free for the team to sum things and write them down.</li>
<li>Testing for e-book platforms also takes time and resources.</li>
</ul><p>So, what happens if I don't hit the goal? Actually I do not intend to not hit it! I have already put lots of time, money and effort into this and I intend to publish it no matter what. You can help me do it faster and better!</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>

<p>Το βιβλίο αυτό θα εκδοθεί με περισσότερες δυνατότητες με τη δική σας βοήθεια. Για αυτό και δεξιά θα δείτε αρκετά ανταποδοτικά οφέλη (Perks).</p>
<h2>Μάθε με αυτό το βιβλίο πως θα προωθήσεις οτιδήποτε στο διαδίκτυο, πως να γλιτώσεις χρήματα και να έχεις αποτελέσματα</h2>
<p>Αυτό το βιβλίο έχει σχεδόν τελειώσει όσον αφορά τη βασική συγγραφή του. Μετά από 12 χρόνια εμπειρίας αποφάσισα να γράψω ένα ολοκληρωμένο εγχειρίδιο. Γιατί; Γιατί με αυτό το βιβλίο οι χρήστες του θα γλιτώσουν και δημιουργήσουν χρήματα και θα έχουν αποτελέσματα. <br/><br/>Αυτό το project αποδίδει <strong>όλη την απαραίτητη εκπαίδευση και δεδομένα (με βήματα)</strong> ώστε κυριολεκτικά οποισδήποτε να μπορεί να προωθήσει οτιδήποτε στα Social Media, μέσω Adwords, Blogs, οπουδήποτε. Επίσης βοηθάει πραγματικά στο να μάθει κάποιος τι είναι και πως εφαρμόζεται το S.E.O. και να το ενσωματώσει στις σελίδες του site του αλλά και έξω από αυτές. Επίσης εξηγεί και παραθέτει εργαλεία για να μετρηθεί το οτιδήποτε. Εξηγεί τόσο το Google Analytics και πως να στηθεί ουσιαστικά ένας μηχανισμός μέτρησης/ανάλυσης όσο και τρόπους μέτρησης της Επιρροής που έχει ένα άτομο στη διάδοση πληροφορίας. Επιπλέον εξηγεί διεξοδικά το ψυχολογικό μέρος εκείνων που διεξάγουν ενέργειες προώθησης αλλά και των αποδεκτών ενεργειών Social Media Marketing, καθώς και ποια πρέπει να είναι η λογική που διέπει τους πρώτους για να δημιουργήσουν επιτυχία!</p>
<p><strong>Επιπρόσθετα, είναι ένας βήμα προς βήμα οδηγός που εξηγεί:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Αρχές, Ψυχολογία και Φιλοσοφία πίσω από το E-Marketing και την ανάπτυξη/διαχείριση Κοινοτήτων. Οι νόμοι της επιτυχίας.</li>
<li>Τι είναι οι Μηχανές Αναζήτησης, πως ταξινομούν την πληροφορία, ποια είναι τα εργαλεία, διαδικασίες, τεχνικές και εμπειρικές πληροφορίες.</li>
<li>Social Media Marketing. Μάθετε σε βάθος τι μπορείτε να κάνετε με το Twitter και το Facebook.</li>
<li>Pinterest Social Marketing.</li>
<li>S.E.O. Πλήρης λίστα με δείκτες βαρύτητας ανά ενέργεια. Πως να έχετε ένα ""υγιές"" website.</li>
<li>""Στήσιμο"" πλήρης Adwords καμπάνιας. Τι να προσέξετε και τι να αποφύγετε.</li>
<li>Adwords Quality Score. Πόσο κρίσιμο είναι, τι είναι, τεχνικές.</li>
<li>Google Analytics και τεχνικές μέτρησης για να έχετε αποτελέσματα και στοιχεία που έχουν πραγματικά στοιχεία.</li>
<li>Περιεχόμενο πλήρως εμπλουτισμένο με εικόνες, σχεδιαγράμματα και επεξηγήσεις.</li>
<li>Μέτρησης Δεικτών Επιρροής και Διάδοσης πληροφορίας. Τι να μετρήσετε, τι έχει σημασία, πως συνδυάζονται.</li>
<li>Επίσης πλήρης κατάλογος (Index) και Γλωσσάρια Όρων αλλά και παραπομπές.</li>
</ul><h2>Πιστεύω στο ανταποδοτικό concept. Για αυτό και θα δείτε κάποια πολύ καλά οφέλη (δεξιά στα Perks).</h2>
<p><span style=""color: #3399ff;""><strong>Δεν χρειάζεστε τα οφέλη;</strong> Η βοήθειά σας με οποιοδήποτε ποσό είναι επίσης καταπληκτική. Θα βοηθήσει ώστε αυτό το βιβλίο να γίνει πραγματικότητα. Απλά κάντε κλικ στο κουμπί ""<strong>Contribute Now</strong>"" και διαλέξτε την τελευταία επιλογή από τη λίστα που θα σας βγάλει συμπληρώνοντας όποιο ποσό επιθυμείτε. </span></p>
<h2>Αυτό είναι ένα ευρύτερο Concept και όχι απλά ένα e-Book</h2>
<p>Αυτό το e-Βook δεν είναι απλά το περιεχόμενο του. Θα βοηθήσει έναν τεράστιο αριθμό από επαγγελματίες στο μάρκετινγκ, διαφημιστές, επαγγελματίες του SEO, ιδιοκτήτες επιχειρήσεων, στελέχη επιχειρήσεων, δημοσιογράφους, διευθυντές, συγγραφείς να μάθουν ανεκτίμητη πληροφορία σε ανεκτή τιμή. Θα τους βοηθήσει να εξελίξουν και να επεκτείνουν το επάγγελμά τους και να δουν νέους ορίζοντες μέσα από αυτό. Για αυτό και λέω ότι αυτό το βιβλίο θα εκδοθεί όπως και να έχει.</p>
<p>Επιπλέον, 3% από τα χρήματα που θα συγκεντρωθούν εδώ, θα πάνε στον οργανισμό ""Κιβωτός του Κόσμου"" (<a href=""http://www.kivotostoukosmou.org/kivotos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.kivotostoukosmou.org/kivotos/</a>). Επειδή και εγώ έχω 2 παιδιά ξέρω ότι τα πιο ευάλωτα έμμεσα και άμεσα από την κρίση είναι αυτά. Το E-Marketing είναι ο δικός μου επαγγελματικός τομέας και ένας από τους τρόπους που μπορώ να βοηθήσω.</p>
<p><strong>Αλλά δεν είναι μόνο αυτό. </strong>Αυτό το βιβλίο μπορεί να βοηθήσει οποιοδήποτε άτομο που είναι τώρα σε ένα συγκεκριμένο τομέα εργασίας, να μεταπηδήσει σε άλλον ή να εξελίξει τον υφιστάμενο.</p>
<p><strong>Αυτούς τους καιρούς που οι προϋπολογισμοί μειώνονται, </strong>οι άνθρωποι ψάχνουν περισσότερους τρόπους για να κάνουν αυτό που έκαναν πιο γρήγορα, καλύτερα και με χαμηλότερο κόστος. Αυτό το e-Book παρέχει αυτό ακριβώς και διδάσκει όλα τα βήματα για να το πετύχετε καθώς επίσης ανανεώνεται αφού η τεχνολογία αλλάζει.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<h2>Που θα πάνε τα χρήματά σας!</h2>
<p>Το ποσό που πραγματικά χρειάζεται σε αυτή τη φάση είναι 14.500.  Η συνολική εργασία θέλει ακόμη περίπου 2 μήνες για να τελειώσει. Προσθέστε σε αυτήν και έξοδα και χρόνο για να το δουν ειδικοί για την επιμέλεια, μεταφράσεις και επεξεργασία των εικόνων και δημιουργία οπτικού υλικού (όλες οι ενότητες που δείχνουν πως να κάνετε κάτι εμπεριέχουν εικόνες και σχήματα βήμα προς βήμα, π.χ σε SEO, Adwords, Analytics, Influential Metrics, Social Media practices, Search Engines logic).</p>
<p>Ουσιαστικά, το απαιτούμενο ποσό καλύπτει περισσότερο έξοδα τρίτων που δεν είναι το δικό μου αντικείμενο.</p>
<p><strong>Επίσης οι συνεισφορές σας θα πάνε σε :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ενέργειες Marketing. Όχι στη διεξαγωγή τους αλλά στα έξοδα τρίτων (π.χ. χρήματα προώθησης προς το Google). Μπορώ να φτιάξω εγώ blogs, sites, campaigns αλλά αυτά που θα ξοδευτούν προς τα Μέσα (Facebook, Google) χρειάζονται για να προωθηθεί το έργο γρήγορα. Έτσι βοηθιούνται και οι Contributors!!!</li>
<li>Επιμέλεια από 2 διαπιστευμένους Επιμελητές στην Αγγλική γλώσσα.</li>
<li>Επαγγελματικός σχεδιασμός περιεχομένου και εξωφύλλων για τη διεθνή αγορά. Αυτό εν μέρει θα το καλύψω κι εγώ αλλά πρέπει να πληρωθούν υπηρεσίες στο εξωτερικό που κάνουν Reviews και αξιολόγηση.</li>
<li>Έλεγχοι ότι όντως είναι σωστά στημένο και εύκολο να αναγνωστεί και testing οδηγιών (π.χ. για το στήσιμο SEO, Καμπάνιας, Στόχων, κλπ). Πρέπει να το ελέγξουν και τρίτοι όπως γίνεται με όλα τα βιβλία τέτοιου τύπου για να είναι σωστά.</li>
<li>Μετατροπή βιβλίου σε μορφή e-Βook για διαφορετικά ψηφιακά οχήματα (π.χ. .mobi για Kindle, .ePub για Sony, iBooks, Nook, κλπ.). Χρειάζεται και χρόνος και αρκετές δοκιμές ανά περίπτωση.</li>
<li>Έκδοση ISBN, copyrights.</li>
<li>Δημιουργία αντιγράφων για να πάνε σε εκπαιδευτικά ιδρύματα, πανεπιστήμια, κολλέγια, κλπ.</li>
<li>Όπως ξέρετε ένα βιβλίο χρειάζεται χρόνο για να γραφτεί σωστά, όσο ειδικός και αν είναι κάποιος στον χώρο του. Ειδικά ένα τέτοιο βιβλίο που καλύπτει μια γκάμα θεμάτων. Αυτός ο χρόνος πρέπει να είναι διαθέσιμος για την ομάδα που το ετοιμάζει και αυτό επίσης είναι μέρος του κόστους παραγωγής.</li>
</ul><p>Υπάρχει και η ερώτηση του τι θα συμβεί αν δεν πετύχω τον οικονομικό στόχο. Ειλικρινά δεν το σκέφτομαι καν γιατί έχω βάλει πολύ περισσότερα από πάρα πολύ χρόνο και κόπο στη δημιουργία του. Θα το εκδώσω όπως και να έχει, απλά με τη δική σας συνεισφορά μπορεί να γίνει καλύτερα και πιο γρήγορα!</p>
<h2>Άλλοι τρόποι για να βοηθήσετε</h2>
<p>Όπως είπα αυτό το e-book θα λύσει τα χέρια σε χιλιάδες και ενδεχομένως και σε εκατομμύρια ανθρώπων σχετικά με το πως να κάνουν το e-marketing μόνοι τους. Για αυτό και θέλω πραγματικά να το εκδώσω. Θα βοηθήσει όλους όσους θέλουν να μάθουν πως να προωθήσουν τους σκοπούς, τις ιδέες τους, τις ταινίες, τη μουσική τους, τις υπηρεσίες και τα προϊόντα τους. <strong>Όλους όσους δουλεύουν από το σπίτι ή σε επιχειρήσεις ή είναι επιχείρηση μόνοι τους!</strong></p>
<p>Το λιγότερο που μπορώ να προσφέρω είναι αναγνώριση και αναφορά με πολλούς τρόπους και κάποια πολύ ωραία δώρα (δεξιά στα Perks). Ακόμη και εάν δεν έχετε το ποσό που θέλετε να συνεισφέρετε μπορείτε να βοηθήσετε στη διάδοση της δράσης χρηματοδότησης. Εδώ έχει όλα όσα χρειάζονται και στο website <a href=""http://www.moveforwardsocial"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.moveforwardsocial.com</a> έχει και άρθρα και ότι άλλο θέλετε. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Βοηθήστε να διαδοθεί!</strong></p></div>","Για την Ελληνική περιγραφή του έργου κάντε κλικ εδώ

Πιστεύω στο ανταποδοτικό concept. Για αυτό και θα δείτε κάποια πολύ καλά οφέλη (δεξιά στα Perks).
Δεν χρειάζεστε τα οφέλη; Η βοήθειά σας με οποιοδήποτε ποσό είναι επίσης καταπληκτική. Θα βοηθήσει ώστε αυτό το βιβλίο να γίνει πραγματικότητα. Απλά κάντε κλικ στο κουμπί ""Contribute Now"" και διαλέξτε την τελευταία επιλογή από τη λίστα που θα σας βγάλει συμπληρώνοντας όποιο ποσό επιθυμείτε. 
Αυτό είναι ένα ευρύτερο Concept και όχι απλά ένα e-Book
Αυτό το e-Βook δεν είναι απλά το περιεχόμενο του. Θα βοηθήσει έναν τεράστιο αριθμό από επαγγελματίες στο μάρκετινγκ, διαφημιστές, επαγγελματίες του SEO, ιδιοκτήτες επιχειρήσεων, στελέχη επιχειρήσεων, δημοσιογράφους, διευθυντές, συγγραφείς να μάθουν ανεκτίμητη πληροφορία σε ανεκτή τιμή. Θα τους βοηθήσει να εξελίξουν και να επεκτείνουν το επάγγελμά τους και να δουν νέους ορίζοντες μέσα από αυτό. Για αυτό και λέω ότι αυτό το βιβλίο θα εκδοθεί όπως και να έχει.
Επιπλέον, 3% από τα χρήματα που θα συγκεντρωθούν εδώ, θα πάνε στον οργανισμό ""Κιβωτός του Κόσμου"" (http://www.kivotostoukosmou.org/kivotos/). Επειδή και εγώ έχω 2 παιδιά ξέρω ότι τα πιο ευάλωτα έμμεσα και άμεσα από την κρίση είναι αυτά. Το E-Marketing είναι ο δικός μου επαγγελματικός τομέας και ένας από τους τρόπους που μπορώ να βοηθήσω.
Αλλά δεν είναι μόνο αυτό. Αυτό το βιβλίο μπορεί να βοηθήσει οποιοδήποτε άτομο που είναι τώρα σε ένα συγκεκριμένο τομέα εργασίας, να μεταπηδήσει σε άλλον ή να εξελίξει τον υφιστάμενο.
Αυτούς τους καιρούς που οι προϋπολογισμοί μειώνονται, οι άνθρωποι ψάχνουν περισσότερους τρόπους για να κάνουν αυτό που έκαναν πιο γρήγορα, καλύτερα και με χαμηλότερο κόστος. Αυτό το e-Book παρέχει αυτό ακριβώς και διδάσκει όλα τα βήματα για να το πετύχετε καθώς επίσης ανανεώνεται αφού η τεχνολογία αλλάζει.
Που θα πάνε τα χρήματά σας!
Το ποσό που πραγματικά χρειάζεται σε αυτή τη φάση είναι 14.500.  Η συνολική εργασία θέλει ακόμη περίπου 2 μήνες για να τελειώσει. Προσθέστε σε αυτήν και έξοδα και χρόνο για να το δουν ειδικοί για την επιμέλεια, μεταφράσεις και επεξεργασία των εικόνων και δημιουργία οπτικού υλικού (όλες οι ενότητες που δείχνουν πως να κάνετε κάτι εμπεριέχουν εικόνες και σχήματα βήμα προς βήμα, π.χ σε SEO, Adwords, Analytics, Influential Metrics, Social Media practices, Search Engines logic).
Ουσιαστικά, το απαιτούμενο ποσό καλύπτει περισσότερο έξοδα τρίτων που δεν είναι το δικό μου αντικείμενο.
Επίσης οι συνεισφορές σας θα πάνε σε :

Ενέργειες Marketing. Όχι στη διεξαγωγή τους αλλά στα έξοδα τρίτων (π.χ. χρήματα προώθησης προς το Google). Μπορώ να φτιάξω εγώ blogs, sites, campaigns αλλά αυτά που θα ξοδευτούν προς τα Μέσα (Facebook, Google) χρειάζονται για να προωθηθεί το έργο γρήγορα. Έτσι βοηθιούνται και οι Contributors!!!
Επιμέλεια από 2 διαπιστευμένους Επιμελητές στην Αγγλική γλώσσα.
Επαγγελματικός σχεδιασμός περιεχομένου και εξωφύλλων για τη διεθνή αγορά. Αυτό εν μέρει θα το καλύψω κι εγώ αλλά πρέπει να πληρωθούν υπηρεσίες στο εξωτερικό που κάνουν Reviews και αξιολόγηση.
Έλεγχοι ότι όντως είναι σωστά στημένο και εύκολο να αναγνωστεί και testing οδηγιών (π.χ. για το στήσιμο SEO, Καμπάνιας, Στόχων, κλπ). Πρέπει να το ελέγξουν και τρίτοι όπως γίνεται με όλα τα βιβλία τέτοιου τύπου για να είναι σωστά.
Μετατροπή βιβλίου σε μορφή e-Βook για διαφορετικά ψηφιακά οχήματα (π.χ. .mobi για Kindle, .ePub για Sony, iBooks, Nook, κλπ.). Χρειάζεται και χρόνος και αρκετές δοκιμές ανά περίπτωση.
Έκδοση ISBN, copyrights.
Δημιουργία αντιγράφων για να πάνε σε εκπαιδευτικά ιδρύματα, πανεπιστήμια, κολλέγια, κλπ.
Όπως ξέρετε ένα βιβλίο χρειάζεται χρόνο για να γραφτεί σωστά, όσο ειδικός και αν είναι κάποιος στον χώρο του. Ειδικά ένα τέτοιο βιβλίο που καλύπτει μια γκάμα θεμάτων. Αυτός ο χρόνος πρέπει να είναι διαθέσιμος για την ομάδα που το ετοιμάζει και αυτό επίσης είναι μέρος του κόστους παραγωγής.
Υπάρχει και η ερώτηση του τι θα συμβεί αν δεν πετύχω τον οικονομικό στόχο. Ειλικρινά δεν το σκέφτομαι καν γιατί έχω βάλει πολύ περισσότερα από πάρα πολύ χρόνο και κόπο στη δημιουργία του. Θα το εκδώσω όπως και να έχει, απλά με τη δική σας συνεισφορά μπορεί να γίνει καλύτερα και πιο γρήγορα!
Άλλοι τρόποι για να βοηθήσετε
Όπως είπα αυτό το e-book θα λύσει τα χέρια σε χιλιάδες και ενδεχομένως και σε εκατομμύρια ανθρώπων σχετικά με το πως να κάνουν το e-marketing μόνοι τους. Για αυτό και θέλω πραγματικά να το εκδώσω. Θα βοηθήσει όλους όσους θέλουν να μάθουν πως να προωθήσουν τους σκοπούς, τις ιδέες τους, τις ταινίες, τη μουσική τους, τις υπηρεσίες και τα προϊόντα τους. Όλους όσους δουλεύουν από το σπίτι ή σε επιχειρήσεις ή είναι επιχείρηση μόνοι τους!
Το λιγότερο που μπορώ να προσφέρω είναι αναγνώριση και αναφορά με πολλούς τρόπους και κάποια πολύ ωραία δώρα (δεξιά στα Perks). Ακόμη και εάν δεν έχετε το ποσό που θέλετε να συνεισφέρετε μπορείτε να βοηθήσετε στη διάδοση της δράσης χρηματοδότησης. Εδώ έχει όλα όσα χρειάζονται και στο website www.moveforwardsocial.com έχει και άρθρα και ότι άλλο θέλετε.

<h3>Where we are right now:</h3>
<p>The book is in production! We reached our goal back in 
August and the campaign has gone into the ""InDemand"" phase. That means that you can still contribute to the campaign and receive the 
Perks listed. The money that is collected at this point will be used to pay for post production expenses that were not calculated into the original budget.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>The
Al-chemia Remedies are essences made from flowers and sacred sites in Egypt,
the land of transformation. This project was started in the year 2000 when the
remedies were made.</p>
<p>Now there is a book about the remedies to make the
information more accessible. The book is ready, edited, pictures taken; all we
need is the money for publishing costs. Join us in making this information more
available to those who would like to learn more about flower wisdom as well as
the magic of Egypt.</p>

<p>Introductie:</p>
<p>Sterrenkijker is het relaas van het leven van een doorsnee gezin in het achterland van Rotterdam. Door de ogen van Lizzy zien we hoe de familieleden omgaan met de niet altijd alledaagse keuzes die Lizzy stilaan in haar leven maakt. Het beschrijft een bij tijd en wijle eenzame zoektocht waarin kleur bekennen onvermijdelijk leidend wordt.<br/>Sterrenkijker is een autobiografische vertelling van Elizabeth van Driel (Brielle, 1963). Een sterrenkijker is een boreling die met het gezichtje hemelwaarts gericht ter wereld komt, de blik reikend naar wat achter de horizon ligt. <br/>Als Lizzy opgroeit en volwassen wordt, bepalen onverwachte ontmoetingen en onvoorspelbare wendingen keer op keer haar bestaan. Daarbij wordt zij gedreven door een nieuwsgierigheid die haar in uitzonderlijke situaties van buitenstaander tot betrokkene maakt. <br/>Sterrenkijker is het relaas van oneindige liefde in een gedreven bestaan. Een pleidooi om je hart te volgen en te geloven, dat opgeven geen optie is.</p>
<p>Mijn naam is Elizabeth van Driel, moeder van twee prachtige kinderen en werkzaam als logopedist en taalspecialist ( doelgroep: kinderen met een taalontwikkelingsstoornis en auditief beperkte kinderen. </p>
<p>In 2014 vroeg mijn zoon me eens op te schrijven hoe hij ter wereld was gekomen. De gedachte dit verhaal aan het papier toe te vertrouwen lonkte en ik begon te schrijven. Zijn verhaal bleek niet in twee woorden te vangen. In de loop van de jaren kreeg het meer en meer vorm. Ik liet het aan verschillende mensen lezen. Er werd herhaaldelijk geopperd het uit te geven als boek.  Er was geen weg meer terug en nu vijf jaar later is de tijd rijp het met de wereld te delen.</p>
<p>Het blijkt, nu het af is, meer dan ons persoonlijke verhaal. Het werd een pleidooi je hart te volgen, kleur te bekennen en niet terug te deinzen op momenten dat weerstand van je omgeving je doet wankelen. Zwem tegen de stroom in, zo hard als je kunt en blijf streven naar het verwezenlijken van je dromen. </p>
<p>Een boek schrijven, vormgeven en uitgeven is erg duur. Daar kwam ik al snel achter. Moest ik dan toch maar op zoek naar een uitgever? Hoeveel ruimte zou mij gegund zijn, mijn verhaal mijn verhaal te laten? Het manuscript lag een paar maanden op de plank en dat voelde niet ok. De gedachte dat het daar zou kunnen blijven liggen, als ik passief bleef toekijken, bracht me ertoe door te pakken. Het boek moest er links- of rechtsom komen. Aan jullie de vraag  mij te helpen dit voor elkaar te krijgen en weet dat ik alles in het werk zal stellen mijn dankbaarheid op gepaste wijze te tonen.</p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</p>
<p>Mijn doel is 3000 euro bij elkaar te sprokkelen om 1000 boeken te laten drukken. Voor dat geld heb ik 1000 softcover boeken. De kosten voor redigeren, opmaak en covervormgeving zijn hierbij niet inbegrepen, maar we komen er vast wel :-) </p>
<p>Voor wat hoort wat, dus ik heb een aantal unieke perks aangemaakt om jullie te bedanken voor elke bijdrage; groot of klein. Wat ik ook  heel tof zou vinden, is als jullie  zoveel mogelijk mensen wijzen op deze crowdfunding. Indiegogo heeft ""sharetools""die het delen met familie, vrienden en andere bekenden heel simpel maken. Dus kan je financieel niet bijdragen, geen probleem: je kunt vast goed rondbazuinen, lawaaien, propageren, rumours verspreiden, stampij maken, opschudding veroorzaken, stennis schoppen. Doe het subtiel maar met overtuiging!</p>
<p>De campagne loopt een maand. Alle bij de donaties behorende bedankjes komen zo snel mogelijk jullie kant op. En.....</p>
<p>.... komen jullie allemaal naar de boeklancering? Laat je e- mailadres/ telefoonnummer achter als je bij de boekpresentatie aanwezig wilt zijn. Ik breng je dan op de hoogte van datum en locatie.

Het manuscript lag een paar maanden op de plank en dat voelde niet ok. De gedachte dat het daar zou kunnen blijven liggen, als ik passief bleef toekijken, bracht me ertoe door te pakken. Het boek moest er links- of rechtsom komen. Aan jullie de vraag  mij te helpen dit voor elkaar te krijgen en weet dat ik alles in het werk zal stellen mijn dankbaarheid op gepaste wijze te tonen.
What We Need & What You Get:
Mijn doel is 3000 euro bij elkaar te sprokkelen om 1000 boeken te laten drukken. Voor dat geld heb ik 1000 softcover boeken. De kosten voor redigeren, opmaak en covervormgeving zijn hierbij niet inbegrepen, maar we komen er vast wel :-)

Dus kan je financieel niet bijdragen, geen probleem: je kunt vast goed rondbazuinen, lawaaien, propageren, rumours verspreiden, stampij maken, opschudding veroorzaken, stennis schoppen. Doe het subtiel maar met overtuiging!

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<br/><i>It’s Not Right-Left. It’s Top-Down. The Truth About The Media </i>is a book about the mainstream news media in the United States and how its structure of corporate ownership prevents them from being the objective, reputable news sources they claim to be. The book illustrates the problems with this system and how we can fix our news media by making them beholden to us and not just their corporate owners. <br/><br/>My name is Owen Mageau, and I am the author of <i>It’s Not Right-Left. It’s Top-Down.</i> I wrote this book with hopes that it would help wake people up to the con game being played by the corporately owned mainstream media, as well as the devastating effects this has on our country. Americans are very good at discrediting news as ‘fake news’ if it comes from the other team, while blindly trusting the sources they believe to be on their side. For example, democrats lament Fox News, whereas they are cheerleaders for the hosts at MSNBC. Republicans, on the other hand, hate MSNBC and put their faith in Fox News being honest in their reporting. <br/><br/>This is a serious problem, because the reality is that all of the corporately owned media outlets in our country are not providing an objective, wholesome version of what is going on in our country and around the world. This leads to a polarized public that is constantly fighting amongst each other, based on distorted views of the truth. All the while, it distracts the American people from the real root of their problems: the corporate elite of this country who own the media and shape our country’s politics to benefit them at the expense of the masses.  <br/><br/>It is my hope that this book educates people on this issue and helps them understand, not only that they are right to question the media’s objectivity, but why the media behaves the way it does. I also shed light on how we can fix this problem and create a media that is beholden to us, the American people, and not just a select few corporate interests. <br/><br/>In this book, you’ll learn about the mainstream media outlets in our country and their respective ownership chains. You will also learn about how and why this leads to certain perspectives being overly prevalent in the mainstream media, while others are essentially completely shut out of the news. Finally, you will learn how grass roots-funded independent journalism is our ticket out of our current problems, and where you can find this type of objective reporting today. <br/><br/>Throughout the many stories in this book, you will learn how well journalists in the mainstream media are treated and how they have every incentive to do what they are told, rather than report objectively. One story details how mainstream journalists fly first class and have their luggage driven across the country for them. Another story details how journalists sometimes deliberately turn away from the truth, in order to report what their bosses want and move up the ranks. <br/><br/>The book also includes stories about independent media outlets that are trying to compete with the corrupt mainstream media. <br/><br/>You will love this book if you’re someone who is interested in the news media, politics, and/or power in America. This book is interesting and relevant to everyone because of the real effects the media has on your life.<br/><br/><i>It’s Not Right-Left. It’s Top-Down. </i>is a nonfiction book that speaks to all Americans who have ever wondered if they are actually getting an objective, wholesome version of the story from the mainstream news media in the United States.  <br/><br/> <h2>The Book - <i>It’s Not Right-Left. It’s Top-Down. The Truth About The Media.</i>
</h2>
<br/>The book has an introduction, conclusion, and four parts sandwiched in between. <br/><br/>The Introduction simply introduces the topic and what the book will be about.<br/><br/>Part 1 consists of Chapter 1 and is titled “A Free Press.” This part outlines how we do in fact have a press that is free from government influence, and how the freedom of the press is guaranteed in the first amendment of the constitution. However, it sets up the framework for the idea that just because a press is free from the government, doesn't necessarily mean it is a free and objective press that serves the people’s best interests. <br/><br/>Part 2 is titled “Corporate Ownership” and consists of chapters 2-5. This part details the origins of the mainstream media, as well as the many mergers and other corporate actions that have led to where we are today. It clearly shows how these outlets are not independent, rather they are small parts of much bigger conglomerates. <br/><br/>Part 3 consists of chapters 6-8 and is really the meat of the book. This section talks about the effects the structure of corporate ownership has on our news and country. There is a chapter on how it impacts what is and isn’t reported, there is a chapter on the filtration system that is in place to shut out certain perspectives, and there is a chapter on the political effects this structure has on our country. This is a very interesting and important section that is driven by many stories of people who have worked at the mainstream media outlets in the United States. <br/><br/>Part 4 talks about how we can fix the problems facing our news media today. This section consists of chapters 9 and 10. In these chapters, I make the case for transitioning from corporately owned media to smaller, grass roots funded, independent media outlets. In addition to making this case, I shed light on some of the alternatives to mainstream media that are already out there, and that you can turn to for truly objective and honest reporting. <br/><br/>Then finally, there is my conclusion, where I sum up the essence of the book. <br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<strong><i>Of Thrones and Thieves</i></strong> is the story of a lost, unsure princess named Elara who goes on a journey both externally and internally to find herself and discover who she is. As she is stolen from everything that she knows, she is forced to overcome her own anxiety and learn to become the queen she was meant to be against all odds.<br/><br/>My name is Jaelynn Hart, and I am the author of <i><strong>Of Thrones and Thieves</strong></i>. I wrote this book because, as a lesbian woman, I don’t often see myself reflected in the heroes of most stories. For example, in Percy Jackson, Harry Potter, and The Hunger Games, there are these fantastical stories of heroes and heroines—and none of them look like me. Percy falls for Annabeth, Harry has Ginny, and Katniss finds Peeta. I made this novel so that, just once, I could be the hero, because I believe representation is important. If I had picked up Harry Potter at eleven years old and Hermione had fallen in love with Luna Lovegood instead of Ron Weasley, I wouldn’t have struggled the way I did with my own identity. So my stories are for the young girls that need to see a hero that looks like them—you’re just as extraordinary as anybody else.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will find yourself between the pages. This is a story about discovering who you are and learning to love yourself along the way. I want you to see <strong><i>Of Thrones and Thieves </i></strong>as an opportunity to escape from a world of prejudice and learn alongside Elara — to find yourself and realize that it doesn’t matter who you love or what you look like. We’re all capable of being the hero in our own stories.<br/><br/>You’ll follow Princess Elara of Metanoia as she is kidnapped on the day of her coronation. Unsure if she is even fit to take over her mother’s place as Queen, Princess Elara finds herself completely in over her head with her new situation as pandemonium breaks out over her castle. She is whisked away from her home and everything she knows, taken aboard a ship of pirates hired to kidnap her by a mysterious third party whose identity is kept a secret. Princess Elara is unwilling to admit defeat, however, and will do whatever she can to escape her captors, even if it means battling the pirate captain, Kai, herself. As tensions rise, Elara finds herself drawn to the sudden, surprising freedom she’s been granted as a prisoner.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you love enemies-to-lovers stories, enjoy fantasy fiction about pirates, or want to see strong heroines conquer their stories. <strong><i>Of Thrones and Thieves</i></strong> speaks to the LGBT+ community and women who want to grapple with strong heroines and lesbian romances in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that this novel inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<p>Why do so many LGBT+ fiction books focus on coming out, rather than on us as people?</p>
<p>How does familial pressure affect your ability to believe in yourself and your position?</p>
<p>Is it easier to find yourself when you’re surrounded by people similar to you?</p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing topics such as finding your identity and learning to trust yourself will change us all for the better.</p>

She is majoring in Creative Writing and will be graduating with her Bachelor of Arts in spring 2021.<br/><br/>In writing this book, Hart hopes to reach out to the LGBT+ community, particularly the lesbian and bisexual community. She wants her book to allow young adults a glimpse into this world she’s created; she hopes that it will reach someone and show them that it’s okay to not know who you are just yet. Hart’s passion includes providing representation to those who need to see that they can be the hero of their story.<br/><br/>When she’s not writing, Hart enjoys making art in other ways; her personal favorite is painting. She also enjoys playing with her two cats, Roxie and Mason, and her dog, Patch.

<p>Hi, my name is Anne Gwaza, I am a writer, a public speaker, and an avid reader myself. </p>
<p>I am here to raise funds to help publish my first book: Cloudjumper. Cloujumper is a gift I received on an otherwise dull autumn day. Though fall is one of my favourite season with its vibrant colours, it also heralds the coming of winter, with its grey, cloudy days and depressing lack of sunshine.. When the story first came to me, it made me smile and got me excited about a season I normally only try to survive. </p>
<p>My desire is to share the joy and hope it gave me with as many people as possible and your contribution will make all the difference!</p>
<p>I need CAD$5,000 to self-publish Cloudjumper and start getting the word out. The book has already been beautifully illustrated by a talented young woman and it is awaiting funding to go straight to press.</p>
<p>Should the campaign raise more than the goal, the money left over would be used for making an animatic of the book, and  to finish and publish a French version (the story has already been translated and the French version is being edited as I write this ).</p>
<p>Many people suffer with Seasonal Affective Disorder (S A D), and my hope is that Cloudjumper will be a tool to start discussions and bring hope and comfort to many around the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We need you to make this hope a reality so may I invite you to check out the great perks we offer to our backers? I trust that you will find them rewarding. Thank you so much for checking out my campaign and may I ask that even if you don’t feel that you can contribute financially at this point, you will be kind enough to spread the word among your friends and acquaintances on social media.</p>
<p>Once more, thank you for your time!</p>

<p>***</p>
<h2>About:</h2>
<p>The White Raven will be my seventh published novel. I have already released an urban fantasy trilogy, <i>The Memory Wars</i>, with WiDo Publishing, and I ventured into self-publishing with <i>Lady Raven</i> in 2014. In 2015, I released the sequel, <i>Red Skies</i>, and <i>Blackened Wings</i> came the following year. </p>
<p>On my website, the first thing visitors will see under my name is the phrase ""Stories to show that monsters can be beaten."" This is the core foundation of all my work. I believe stories, particularly adventure stories, are important for showing us that we can be better people. When we read an adventure story, we stop thinking and start feeling. We get swept up in the excitement and emotion, forgetting about the ordinary world. In essence, we join the hero on their journey through the world fantastic. When we return, as does the hero, we bring with us what we've learned. We can take lessons from stories and apply them to our own lives.</p>
<p>With the <i>Lady Raven</i> series, I explore themes of religion and myth, and how they can be used both to oppress and to educate. The Empire Cora has grown up in is fiercely patriarchal, and treats women as little better than property. It also subjugates other nations, assured of its divine right to rule over ""lesser"" peoples. </p>
<p>During this campaign I'll be posting updates with excerpts from the first three books in the series, as well as tidbits from the new book. The cover art above was all made by me, and while I'm proud of them, I know they make the books stand out as self-published. I want to give the series every chance it deserves, and that means accepting my own creative limitations. I have a great artist lined up, and I'm confident the new covers will blow everyone away.</p>
<p>What I'm asking for is your help to bring Cora's story to as many readers as possible. I've learned a lot from her over the last few years, facing my own monsters and learing my own hidden strengths. </p>
<p>And for those of you who've been with me all the way, or who just prefer the original covers, don't worry. I'll be including pledge levels that let you get the complete matching set.</p>
<p><strong>Monsters can be beaten</strong></p>
<p>I've opted for the flexible funding option, which means that even if I don't hit my target, your contribution will still go towards the release of The White Raven and the re-launch of the series. The White Raven is currently under revisions before going to my editor, and I'm aiming for a release in July. With your help, I can bring this saga to a fitting close.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Mallory McClarin is one of those high-schoolers who appears to have it all together. She gets good grades, plays two sports, and has tons of friends. But she has a secret: she’s gay, and she’s done a pretty good job of hiding it for the past few years. That is, until she discovers Lacy Randolph—the most openly-gay-and-proud-of-it girl at Orange County High School.<br/><br/>Mallory refuses to let this one slip, and after many attempts to pursue her, everything seems to follow Mallory’s appearance of “perfect” when she eventually wins Lacy over. Mallory comes out of the closet to be with the girl of her dreams and is bombarded with support, and everything seems way too perfect to be true. As Mallory soon discovers—that’s because it is. <br/><br/>My name is Michelle Lori, and I am the author of the LGBT YA novel <i>The Head and The Heart</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to contribute a voice and a story to the often underrepresented or misrepresented narrative of relationship abuse in the LGBT community, specifically LGBT youth. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that relationship abuse and dating violence can happen between any two people, at any age, and that identifying it, breaking free from it, and recovering from it is a daunting task. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to see a reflection of yourself—no matter who you are—and grapple with ideas of love, loss, toxicity, and hope. </p>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in the human condition, if you wish to learn more about the topic of relationship abuse, or even if you simply love an intriguing story.<br/><br/><i>The Head and The Heart</i> speaks to members of the young LGBT community who want to see themselves included in the conversation of what a healthy relationship looks like. Even beyond that, the book speaks to friends, parents, teachers, and supporters of LGBT youth—those who want to better understand the struggles and the intricacies of relationship abuse across a wide range of individuals. Abuse is an issue that concerns all of humanity; therefore, this book can speak to anyone who picks it up. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>The Head and The Heart</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have I been or am I currently involved in an unhealthy relationship? </li>
<li>How is my relationship with my partner affecting my life outside of the relationship? </li>
<li>Does society’s view of a “good” relationship reflect a healthy one? </li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing the distinction between relationship abuse and love, especially among the younger community, will change us all for the better. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - <i>The Head and The Heart</i>
</h2>
<p>The book is written in 4 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1: Everything Looks Different in Darkness</strong> contains the author’s note + chapters 1-11. In this section, readers will be introduced to Mallory McClarin, and they will set off alongside her in her pursuit of her crush, Lacy Randolph. They will watch the growth of Mallory’s infatuation for Lacy, and eventually they will see this relationship come to fruition and bring a plethora of problems with it.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2: Let It Rain</strong> contains chapters 12-23. In this section, readers will follow Mallory as she dives deeper into the danger that comes with Lacy Randolph as the tension in their relationship grows. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3: All Lost, Quite Lost</strong> contains chapters 24-34. In this section, readers will witness the fallout and consequences of Mallory and Lacy’s relationship.  <br/><br/><strong>Part 4: The Thing About Hope</strong> contains chapters 35-38. In this section, readers will learn just how much Mallory has suffered because of Lacy’s presence in her life. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Brittany and I'm the creator of the Sobriety and Soul Project. Soon after I decided to stop drinking, I bounced all over the internet and went to a meditation retreat trying to figure out how to navigate being sober in a drinking society. What I found is that I didn't align with services on the addiction/treatment side of the spectrum, but I also knew that I had not been living a healthy, non-attached relationship with alcohol.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, I've discovered that I'm not alone in this. There are many of us living in the ""gray area"" on the spectrum of relationship with alcohol. </p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because I believe that community and resources for those of us wanting to change our relationship with alcohol, but not needing treatment, are minimal. With your help, I can change that.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help me add a depth of story to a book that I've been working on in my journey. I want to create a podcast, in which I will interview others who have also navigated sobriety. I have multiple contributors who are stoked to talk about sharing their story, for the sake of reaching others and helping them with their path toward sobriety. Interviews from the podcast will be made available to the public and will be used to add more dimension to my book.</p>
<p>No matter where you are with your thoughts, feelings and habits around alcohol, you can make a difference for those who need support. Not everyone is appropriate for AA or treatment, but because of how embeded alcohol is in our professional and personal lives, sometimes not drinking can be more of a challenge than it needs to be.</p>
<p>Leaving alcohol out of the equation has worked absolute wonders in my life. I am more present, more available to my business and family, and able to process the ups and downs of life in a more meaningful way. This world is in desperate need of more of us who are present, aware, and available. We are in a time where living your best life, driven by the soul, could change the world for the better. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am looking to raise at least $3,000.<ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will make a difference in so many ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The more people I can connect with, the more people we will be able to reach and help along the way.</li>
<li>Anyone can listen to a podcast in the privacy of their own home. We can reach those who are considering getting sober, and just not sure how to make it happen.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any project, this is an adventure. For me personally and professionally, this is the first time I've ever worked on a project and am approaching it with a great deal of openness to where it will go. The only set goal is to be a contribution the lives of others who desire to change their habits around alcohol. So, the risks involved are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't know all of the answers right now. This project will truly be lead by the people involved. I am generally a planner and I like to have a solid outline of my goal, but with this, I'm setting out to answer questions I've had about alcohol in our culture AND to contribute to others in the same situation.</li>
<li>At worst, my book could be a total flop and nobody would listen to the podcast.</li>
<li>At best, we could collectively create an entire shift in our culture where alcohol consumption isn't an assumed path for all of us and we could expand the discussion around the spectrum of alcohol use.</li>
<li>I am a writer and have been since my high school days, but podcasting is new to me. My intent is to approach all interviews with curiosity, humor, and shared-intention of answering the questions we all have when we decide to rid ourselves of habits that get in the way of our best life.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>

Share on Facebook, via email, text, etc. Indiegogo even has ""share"" tools to help this project get off the ground. Please use them as often as you can between now and July 1, 2018.</li>
<li>Connect me with others who could contribute to the project. Do you know someone with a fantastic story of living a sober life? Perhaps you know someone who edits videos and podcasts, takes photos, etc? Anyone you can connect me to that will help grow the project makes a huge difference. I don't have a project without funding, but more importantly, I don't have a project without the right people.<ul><li>Email me at sobrietyandsoul@gmail.com to connect me with your people!</li></ul>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8070/8189630577_43e90d40e0_z.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;""><em>(Jamie with the horses out in Western Mongolia: October 2012) </em></p>
<p>It was nearly a century ago that the Anglo-Irish explorer Sir Charles Howard-Bury first stepped out of his door, determined to explore the remote unknown of Kazakhstan’s Tien Shan Mountains, the 'Mountains of Heaven'. At the time of 1913 tensions in pre-war Europe were on the rise, Central Asia was still in the midst of the Great Game between Britain and Russia, and China, having recently deposed the Manchu emperors, was in a state of anarchy. However Howard-Bury loved nothing but to revel in the challenge of the inaccessible, and he set out unsupported to explore and photograph the most remote mountain valleys in little-known lands right in the heart of Central Asia.</p>
<p>To celebrate the life of this great explorer - who was later to lead the first expedition attempting to conquer Mount Everest in 1921 – we (Jamie Maddison and Matthew Traver) wish to recreate Howard-Bury's exact journey to the Mountains of Heaven in the same manner he travelled by in 1913, starting next May on the centenary of his departure. Our six-month expedition will involve thousands of miles of travel by trains, barges and also 1700km of horse-riding across the remote steppes of Kazakhstan. Where travelling in the same manner as Howard-Bury is impossible due to changes over time, we have committed to undertaking a human-powered alternative.<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/534112_418404488225333_1503888137_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/> For instance, we will bicycle 3000km through Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. At no point will we use a car, bus or other means of personal mechanised transport.</p>
<p> We thought of this project nearly three years ago now - when Jamie was stuck on a long, rickety truck journey back from Kyrgyzstan's section of the Tien Shan Mountains – and it has dominated the lives of both of us ever since. We've put hundreds of hours of work into researching this route and organising the very complex logistics needed to get us through over twenty countries. We even recently embarked on a six week expedition to Western Mongolia to meet and ride with the Kazkah horse-rider Alpamys, who will be accompanying us for the riding section of our trip. Everything is in place; all we need now is the funding to make the expedition possible!</p>
<p>We hope you will consider supporting our expedition to help honour the impressive life of Howard-Bury and the great heritage of exploration he represents.</p>

compassionate, ethical and caring 
human
being who naturally transforms human culture and seeks to restore the living 
earth. <br/></p><p>I write about the vast<b> I am-ness of the soul state</b> which naturally reconciles opposites, heals split, re-marries masculine and feminine energies and brings peace, loving awareness and inspiration to all undertakings. People who embody soul consciousness, walk in tolerance, reverence and naturally serve all of life. They contribute great works 
that span art to social change to environmental and technological inventions. They contribute new paradigms  in education, medicine, spiritual development, capitalism 
and social movements that help make

narcissistic culture. I describe this 
transformation as a re-evolution
 of compassion because it requires healing the soul wound created by 
narcissistic 
culture and re-opening the heart. Increased levels of emotional
 healing are essential to creating a tipping point within humanity that 
will naturally accelerate this collective leap in consciousness. <br/></p><p>I discuss  the important role <b>spiritual emergency</b> plays in creating a crack through which Love can then flow into our lives and create personal and collective transformation.

My name is Greta Bro. For
those of you who do not know me, I am a seeker, a teacher, a shaman and sound healer, poet, singer-songwriter and writer. Over the past thirty years I have acted as a kind of spiritual midwife
for hundreds of people who have looked to me to help them break free from 
familial and cultural dysfunction, collective madness really, and begin 
to build an authentic  soul filled life, over flowing with purpose, compassion, clarity and inspiration.  I have started this Indiegogo campaign because I am entering the final stage of 
editing a book I have written about navigating the great evolutionary leap in consciousness now happening on Earth. In the book  I have 
entitled, ""Passionate Wholeness: The Re-evolution of Compassion
 
and the Healing of our
World."" I write about what it means to move from narcissistic wounding to the wisdom, connection, compassion and wholeness of the soul. I began writing this book in early 2008 after being awakened from sleep by clear, audible 
guidance, that said ""write a treatise of the
 soul."" It has taken me several 
years of writing to complete this labor of love and I now need to take a month off to edit it. My immediate goal for the campaign is $5,500 but my stretch
 goal is $12,500.  After I complete the final editing 
I will then move forward into print book formatting, cover 
design and book distribution. In the book I write about the immense opportunities of our era, the
ultimate potential being, a massive, collective quantum leap in consciousness.  I assert that humanity is  entering a new developmental stage, undergoing  a 
growth surge, that is enabling us to birth a more mature, 
compassionate, ethical and caring 
human
being who naturally transforms human culture and seeks to restore the living 
earth. I write about the vast I am-ness of the soul state which naturally reconciles opposites, heals split, re-marries masculine and feminine energies and brings peace, loving awareness and inspiration to all undertakings. People who embody soul consciousness, walk in tolerance, reverence and naturally serve all of life. They contribute great works 
that span art to social change to environmental and technological inventions. They contribute new paradigms  in education, medicine, spiritual development, capitalism 
and social movements that help make 
those societal structures

 of compassion because it requires healing the soul wound created by

will naturally accelerate this collective leap in consciousness. I discuss  the important role spiritual emergency plays in creating a crack through which Love can then flow into our lives and create personal and collective transformation. I give examples from my own healing journey through debilitating  autoimmune illness, to spontaneous shamanic healing and soul retrieval, to self forgiveness and self love, to substantial inner union and soul purpose.

For many of our contributors, this payment — modest as it may be — is the first time that they have been remunerated for their writing, and we see Lateral as a stepping stone towards a career in science communication.We managed to publish two years worth of content from our first crowdfunding campaign back in 2015, which was a great start. Now we need your help once more as we transition to our next phase as a not-for-profit charity. The funds from this campaign will also help us pay overhead costs for the magazine, including registering the magazine as a company and applying for charity status with the Australian Charities and Not-For-Profits Commission (ACNC). This will allow us to move towards more permanent funding sources and apply for grants to sustain the magazine going forward.This year, each issue of Lateral will be accompanied by our new podcast: Collateral. Like the magazine, producing a podcast costs money. Collateral will provide an avenue to help emerging science communicators develop their podcast and radio skills alongside their written and artistic abilities.Meanwhile, our tireless editorial team will continue to volunteer their free time every week to ensure that each issue of Lateral brings you a diverse range of high-quality, reliable science content. We don’t receive any payment, but feel free to buy us a drink if you see us around.What do you get out of it?In the past two years, our articles were viewed over 150,000 times — and every single one of those viewings was free! Lateral wants scientific thinking to be shared as widely as possible and, by supporting us, you will be rewarded with a swathe of original, intelligent and creative content.Not enough incentive? If you donate to our campaign, you will also have the option to choose one of many exciting perks. Based on your contribution, you can sponsor an article or even a column for a whole year. If there’s a field of science that you’re particularly passionate about, you can even choose the theme of an entire Lateral issue.Stretch goalsIf we exceed our $10,000 goal, we will invest those funds into ensuring the long-term longevity of Lateral, and also increase the amount of original magazine content per issue.$15,000: If we reach 150% funding, we'll pay our contributors more. They deserve it for the high quality work they produce and we want to value that as highly as we can.  $20,000: If we receive 200% of our goal, we will organise an emerging science writers conference in Melbourne in 2018/2019. We will invite a variety of science communicators to attend, hold workshops, and create networking opportunities for writers new to science communication.Risks? Challenges?We’ve been on a short hiatus since September 2017 to shore up the magazine, but the next issue of Lateral magazine will be published on February 5th, and our team of editors, writers and artists are already toiling away to prepare content, which we’re sure you will love. (Hint: We can’t give too much away, but the next theme is “Waves”). While we have secured some institutional funding to help us move forward, and have enough to cover what we’ve already commissioned, we really do need your help to continue publishing Lateral.We’ve got such a great smorgasboard of stories to tell you this year, and we’d hate for you to miss out.Other Ways You Can HelpLight on cash, but still want to help Lateral? Whether you contribute $1 or $1000, we really appreciate every cent of support. If you'd like to help Lateral in another way, please share this crowdfunding campaign to your networks — it will make a world of difference.We’re working on developing new funding streams that will help secure Lateral in the long-term, including forming partnerships with scientific or academic organisations. If you are involved with an organisation that might like to formally partner with Lateral, please get in touch with us.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Happy Break-up</h3>
<p><strong>The Happy Break-Up</strong> is a book of quotes, prompts, illustrations and wisdom nuggets that will help you regain your self-esteem and sense of purpose after a break up. It is intended to make you do some deep thinking and a little bit of hard personal work, in order to get to a place where you fully and completely love yourself.</p>
<p>It is not a book about bashing your ex, nor is it a book about getting your ex back. This book is <strong>all about you</strong> and making yourself the priority, moving forward.  </p>
<h2><u>Why me? Why this book? Why now?</u></h2>
<p>I’m Cate. I’m the author and illustrator of <strong>The Happy Break-Up</strong>. I wrote this book because I’ve been through a lot of break-ups, without any real help or guidance, and I never quite knew how to “get over it” in a happy and healthy way. I went to therapy, which was the best thing I’ve ever done in my life. And since then, I’ve moved on from my prior career in the television industry, and am currently pursuing my Masters of Counselling Psychology, in order to become a psychotherapist. I am a natural communicator and storyteller, as well as an artist, and I have an innate desire to help others.  The knowledge that I’ve gained throughout my life, both from personal experiences, and from my studies, has put me in a good position to share my wisdom with you.</p>
<h2><u>About the publishing process</u></h2>
<p>I have partnered with Golden Brick Road Publishing House, where a team of experts will undertake all the editing, publishing, marketing, design for <strong>The Happy Break-Up</strong>.  Ky-Lee Hanson and her team of dedicated professionals have been helping me throughout the development process of the book and will see it through beyond its completion and publication.</p>
<h2><u>About the book</u></h2>
<p><strong>The Happy Break-Up</strong> is a beautiful piece of art, which will inspire you every time you pick it up. It contains a mixture of hand-drawn quotes and art, prompts, and wisdom nuggets, that when completed, should help you feel a sense of purpose and an increase in confidence. This is a book that requires active participation as well as introspection and deep thinking, in order to achieve the best possible outcome for your life. At the same time, <strong>The Happy Break-Up</strong> is also a fun and interesting experience – you’ll hardly notice that you’re doing the hard mental work, because the activities are created to make you smile.</p>

The eBooks will retail for $2.99-$4.95 on Amazon and iTunes.</p>
<p>What will separate “Short and Sweet” from the Dummies and Idiots series? The ""Short and Sweet"" series will be just that short and sweet, to the point, no fluff.  It will contain more graphics and images, because a picture is worth a thousand words.</p>
<p>I decided to publish this book as an electronic book because eBook sales grew 177% last year and show no signs of slowing according to an article <a href=""http://greensborolibrary.wordpress.com/2010/05/11/the-future-of-ebooks-in-libraries-the-coming-revolution-for-the-book/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">posted on May 11, 2010 by jtimothycole</a>. Basically, creating an eBook affords me the flexibility and opportunity to provide illustrations and example videos, which wouldn't be possible with traditional publications.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I’m looking to raise $2,500 to aid in publishing my first eBook in the “Short and Sweet” series.  A few more topics being considered for the series are Dating - Short and Sweet, Facebook - Short and Sweet, and Pinterest - Short and Sweet.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Funds collected will go toward the following</p>
<ul>
<li>To cover the cost of expert editing</li>
<li>Software need to properly format eBook for publishing and optimal resolution</li>
<li>To cover the cost of a Graphic Artist/Illustrator</li>
<li>To cover the cost of marketing and promotions</li>
