<p>I was born in 1991, in the times of
war, in a family of humble laborers living in a small town of Priboj, on the border of Serbia, Bosnia and
Montenegro, Ever since I was in primary school, I have been determined to live the change I want to see in the world.
At 17, I received the <b>US State
Department Scholarship </b>for Exchange and Education as one of the 50 future leaders from Serbia and Montenegro. At 18, I received <b>President
Obama’s Award</b> for community service and contribution to society and <b>Rotary Club’s
recognition </b>for outstanding academics and citizenship. At 19, I welcomed a group of over 60 American students and professors to my small
hometown. Serbian
Philanthropic Forum recognized my twin brother and me as '<b>'the bright future of philanthropy.''</b> Currently, I am serving as the Representative to the Board of Trustees at AUBG. I worked every summer around 15 hours a day to be able to graduate
as the <b>first family member with a

<p> Receiving
a US State Department Scholarship <b>as one of 50 young leaders from Serbia
and Montenegro</b> gave me an opportunity to study abroad and piqued my passion
for service to such a beautiful yet esoteric idea of international community. A
year spent in Washington State challenged me to act as an ambassador among
peers from more than 30 countries. Through a
number of presentations about Serbia, for instance, I convinced a group of 60 students and professors to visit my
hometown in the hope of showing them that the Balkans is more than a mere
slaughterhouse. I was honored by the Rotary
Club, for <b>outstanding citizenship and academics</b> and the community
engagement as a foreign student. My devotion to the local community was best
reflected through more than a hundred hours of volunteer work in the local
charity and development organizations. At the end of my year abroad, I received President <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Obama’s award for<b> community service and contribution to society</b> </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">and a thank note from the

misunderstanding. With your help, Johns Hopkins School of Advance International Studies will provide me

the world.” (Mandela)</span></i><p></p>
<p>At the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), I have built strong academic
foundations and worked as a research and teaching assistant in politics and
finance. For my academic achievement and research contribution, I have <b>received <i>European Stipend</i> two times in a row</b>. I sought a balance between theory and practice that led me to chair and
organize a number of simulations of international institutions, such as Model UN. I also organized and led our college’s first <i>Jessup
International Law Moot Court</i> team. Since then, I have been fortunate enough
to analyze developments of international relations and politics by <b>publishing articles in the <i>Fair Observer</i></b><i>. </i>Based on my writing on the Serbian prospects toward NATO
membership, International Security and Affairs Center granted me a<b> study trip to NATO Headquarters </b>and
the Senate of Czech Republic, which was the presiding country of the EU at the moment.
Discussion with high officials and diplomats reassured me that my passion
for diplomacy and international service is long-lasting. </p>

single moment before starting to improve the world” (A. Frank)</i><p></p>
<p>Aside of my academic interests and
professional engagement, I have seen steps at the local level as vital for the
lasting change. In my first year of college, I spent almost every Friday<b> working with kids deprived of parental care</b>, to empower them to present their full potential, performing at a community concert. At 18, I received
funding from the <i>American Council</i>  to
organize the first School Parliament in my hometown and engage the youth in the community projects. For a short time I have
<b>organized <i>run-change</i> volunteer campaign </b>which gathered ethnically diverse
young people of Priboj to work towards achieving the same goal – better

Johns Hopkins has always been my dream school, and I worked hard to get into it. I'm very close now, but I still need your support. Big achievements are made one small step at the time.

He is highly regarded and respected by our entire campus community--his fellow students, the faculty and the administration.""                - Michael W. Easton                  President of the American University in Bulgaria************************************************************************WHO IS BOBAN?
Although my
parents planned for me to be a carpenter, I have long dreamed of an
education and experience which would shape me as an outstanding person, a
worthy citizen and a changemaker. Today, I am graduating from American University in Bulgaria (AUBG) as the Presidential Medalist, with Magna Cum Laude and double degree
in Political Science & International Relations and Business Administration.
I was born in 1991, in the times of
war, in a family of humble laborers living in a small town of Priboj, on the border of Serbia, Bosnia and
Montenegro, Ever since I was in primary school, I have been determined to live the change I want to see in the world.
At 17, I received the US State
Department Scholarship for Exchange and Education as one of the 50 future leaders from Serbia and Montenegro. At 18, I received President
Obama’s Award for community service and contribution to society and Rotary Club’s
recognition for outstanding academics and citizenship. At 19, I welcomed a group of over 60 American students and professors to my small
hometown. Serbian
Philanthropic Forum recognized my twin brother and me as ''the bright future of philanthropy.'' Currently, I am serving as the Representative to the Board of Trustees at AUBG. I worked every summer around 15 hours a day to be able to graduate
as the first family member with a
college degree. Now, it’s time to move forward with your support!
CITIZEN OF THE WORLD 
“I am not an Athenian or a Greek, but a citizen of
the world”(Socrates)
 Receiving
a US State Department Scholarship as one of 50 young leaders from Serbia
and Montenegro gave me an opportunity to study abroad and piqued my passion
for service to such a beautiful yet esoteric idea of international community. A
year spent in Washington State challenged me to act as an ambassador among
peers from more than 30 countries. Through a
number of presentations about Serbia, for instance, I convinced a group of 60 students and professors to visit my
hometown in the hope of showing them that the Balkans is more than a mere
slaughterhouse. I was honored by the Rotary
Club, for outstanding citizenship and academics and the community
engagement as a foreign student. My devotion to the local community was best
reflected through more than a hundred hours of volunteer work in the local
charity and development organizations. At the end of my year abroad, I received President Obama’s award for community service and contribution to society and a thank note from the
Presidential Council on Service and Civic Participation. For my contribution to
international education, I was granted membership in the Phi Beta Delta Honor Society for International Scholars. These
experiences inspired me to continue serving the idea of community and to build
bridges, through diplomacy, between people who seem to share little more than
misunderstanding. With your help, Johns Hopkins School of Advance International Studies will provide me
with knowledge, tools and connections to continue doing so effectively.*my friends from Washington, in my hometown in Serbia
ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change
the world.” (Mandela)
At the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), I have built strong academic
foundations and worked as a research and teaching assistant in politics and
finance. For my academic achievement and research contribution, I have received European Stipend two times in a row. I sought a balance between theory and practice that led me to chair and
organize a number of simulations of international institutions, such as Model UN. I also organized and led our college’s first Jessup
International Law Moot Court team. Since then, I have been fortunate enough
to analyze developments of international relations and politics by publishing articles in the Fair Observer. Based on my writing on the Serbian prospects toward NATO
membership, International Security and Affairs Center granted me a study trip to NATO Headquarters and
the Senate of Czech Republic, which was the presiding country of the EU at the moment.
Discussion with high officials and diplomats reassured me that my passion
for diplomacy and international service is long-lasting. 
*Serbian students at the American University in BulgariaSERVING THE COMMUNITY “How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a
single moment before starting to improve the world” (A. Frank)
Aside of my academic interests and
professional engagement, I have seen steps at the local level as vital for the
lasting change. In my first year of college, I spent almost every Friday working with kids deprived of parental care, to empower them to present their full potential, performing at a community concert. At 18, I received
funding from the American Council  to
organize the first School Parliament in my hometown and engage the youth in the community projects. For a short time I have
organized run-change volunteer campaign which gathered ethnically diverse
young people of Priboj to work towards achieving the same goal – better
community.  Although it was only a small step, it
showed the importance of mutually beneficial projects for development of small
communities.

guaranteeing that every child left with a smile on their face and a book in
hand. The project was so successful that the Family Health Center asked us expand the mission in both scope and practice to include the remaining eleven clinics in
the Waco area. Medical Humanities created a team of individuals—driven to touch the lives of the next generation and to serve a community that has become a second-home—to tackle this project. The goal to acquire books was soon realized. Half-Price Books in Dallas, Texas donated over 21,000 books—one for each pediatric patient! Suddenly, the goal of getting a book into the hands of every
child was accomplished. Since then, the mission has evolved to create children’s plays areas, which would incorporate books, into every Family
Health Center clinic!</p><p></p>

Numerous studies have shown that students who are exposed to reading before preschool are more likely to do well in all facets of formal education

the Waco area. Medical Humanities created a team of individuals—driven to touch the lives of the next generation and to serve a community that has become a second-home—to tackle this project. The goal to acquire books was soon realized. Half-Price Books in Dallas, Texas donated over 21,000 books—one for each pediatric patient! Suddenly, the goal of getting a book into the hands of every
child was accomplished. Since then, the mission has evolved to create children’s plays areas, which would incorporate books, into every Family
Health Center clinic!
This Is Where You Come In...We have already completed the construction of a children's play area in the waiting rooms of the South 18th and MLK clinics, but more remains to be done! Ten Family Health Center satellite clinics have yet to be touched by this incredible project, and they need your help in financing the play areas!The ImpactAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics, almost two-thirds of American low-income families do not own books for their children. Books serve as inspiration for dreams and as gateways for journeys; they're important not only for the development of a child's intellect but also the development of a child's perspective, creativity, and imagination. Children who are exposed to reading have higher aptitude for learning in general. Numerous studies have shown that students who are exposed to reading before preschool are more likely to do well in all facets of formal education
—it teaches children the ability to grasp abstract concepts, apply logic
in various scenarios, and utilize good judgment.With your help, we can create children's play areas to distribute more than 20,000 books to Family Health Center clinics located throughout the Waco community, fostering an environment dedicated to nurturing the minds of young children. Other Ways You Can HelpAs college students, we understand that not everyone is financially able to support our cause. Any support—whether it be sharing this campaign, encouraging our team to keep striving towards our goal, or sending a prayer our way—is greatly appreciated! Books don't grow on trees, and although we have more than 20,000, we don't necessarily have an unlimited supply; so if you would like to donate books, feel free to contact Kathleen_Marcos@baylor.edu or Andrew_Orr@baylor.edu.Again, thank you so much for your time and support!",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>
<b>Because they are growing up in a world full of complex problems with no instruction booklet.</b> Kids need experience working independently on open-ended 
projects that are goal-directed but unscripted.  By activating their 
hands <i>and </i>their minds, Tinkering helps kids develop the <b>skills, knowledge and grit</b> necessary to become the innovators their generation is going to need. Tinkering develops: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Problem-solving </b>skills</li>
<li>
<b>Adaptability </b>and <b>resilience</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Collaboration</b> with peers</li>
<li>
<b>An intuitive grasp</b> of science, technology, engineering, art and math <b>(STEAM) </b>principles
</li>
<li>The <b>confidence </b>that only comes from <b>competence</b>

Tinkering succeeds at imparting these skills because it has a<b> secret weapon: it is pure natural fun! </b>Human childhood evolved to make it fun for kids to use their hands and brains to figure out the physical world. <b>Tinkering is literally what kids were born to do.</b> <br/><br/><p></p>

</div>
What at first seems like a random set of items (motors, wooden parts, springs and bolts, rubber bands and washable markers) rapidly becomes a platform for innovation in the hands of kids.<br/>
<br/><h4>What Can You Do With the Electric Motors Catalyst?</h4>
<div>
<img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1382625/files/20150414102946-Challenges_not_instructions.gif?1429032586"" src="""" style=""""/>You can build a <b>countless number of projects</b> that utilize the power of electric motors. To help you get started, the Catalyst comes with a set of <b>Challenge Cards</b> to inspire kids to explore. Some of the challenges include:<br/> <br/><ul>
<li>Build a machine that <b>draws curvy lines</b><br/>
</li>
<li>Build a <b>vehicle that moves in a straight line</b><br/>
</li>
<li>Build a machine that <b>sends a message in Morse Code</b>

<li>Build a machine that can <b>climb a string</b>
</li>
<li>Create something that <b>makes a loud sound</b>
</li>
<li>Build a <b>vehicle with a suspension system</b>
</li>
<li>...and<b> many more.</b> Here are just a few things kids have come up with so far in our prototype test sessions:<br/>

<br/>
<h4>Who is it For?</h4>The kits are designed for <b>boys and girls</b> <b>aged 6-13</b>, but even adults have been known to spend hours Tinkering with the Catalyst. We've spent a great deal of time designing and testing so that any kid — <b>regardless of experience</b> — can engage quickly make something that captures their imagination. Whether a kid is a budding artist, poet, engineer, scientist, athlete, or dreamer, they will love creating things with the Catalyst.<br/><br/>
<p>With help from our friends in their homes, schools, scout troops, 
the Exploratorium, the Boys and Girls Club and Stanford University 
d.school, we’ve watched hundreds of kids invent using the Electric 
Motors Catalyst. In every Tinkering session, kids create things we never
 knew were possible. Who knows what your kids will invent?

<br/><h4>Where Can You Use it?</h4>
<b>At home</b>, kids have a blast Tinkering on their own or with friends and siblings. <b>In  schools, clubs </b>and other group settings <b>Catalyst 10-packs</b> are a great way to provide students with open-ended learning experiences. The kits are designed for children to be able to work independently without help. The included <b>Challenge </b>and <b>Tip Cards</b> give kids just enough guidance to get started, and they make it easy for any adult to facilitate a Tinkerthon with 20 or more kids!<br/><p><br/></p>

<br/><h4>Why Does the Electric Motors Catalyst Work?</h4>
In an ideal Tinkering experience a child has fun right away, runs into problems, solves them, and is then inspired to do more. 10 years of projects and activities have taught us that incorporating the following principles leads to higher engagement and better outcomes:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Fast and tweakable:</b> Parts are simple to attach, tweak and take apart so that kids can quickly and easily try different things.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Challenges, not instructions:</b> We don't provide step-by-step instructions, but include Challenge and Tip Cards help kids get started and inspire them to create on their own inventions.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Real, not imaginary:</b> We use recognizable hardware, tools and 
materials so that kids easily connect and incorporate the Catalyst with
 the objects in the world around them.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Safe:</b> Carefully planned parts allow for freedom of exploration without the need for adult supervision.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Collaborative:</b> Once we’re up and running, kids can join our online community where 
they can share ideas, learn from others, and provide 
support.</li>

</div>
<div>
<b>Each Electric Motors Catalyst includes the following pieces:</b><br/>
</div>
<ol>
<li><p><b>Custom-designed laser-cut wood parts.</b> The “ladybug platform” inspires kids with an unusual shape and carefully designed arrangement of holes and tabs that makes all kinds of configurations possible.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Electric motors and battery pack</b>. Both are equipped with kid-friendly connectors for high-speed trial and error. Batteries are included.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Real safety glasses. </b>Because safety is a superpower!</p></li>
<li><p><b>Real screwdriver</b>. Having your own real tools is a step toward independence.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Hardware and electrical connectors.</b> Bolts, wing nuts, angle brackets, and springs create an amazing array of ways to assemble inventions and connect electrical circuits. <b>Rubber bands</b> let you connect it all together—and then take it all apart—fast.<br/></p></li>
<li><p><b>Washable markers</b>. Because it's fun to make machines that draw <i>and  </i>it's fun to draw on machines.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Challenge Cards</b> for inspiration and <b>Tip Cards</b> that provide just the right amount of guidance. Can you build a machine that scrambles an egg? Or draws curvy lines? Or sends a message in Morse code? We think you can!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are also <b>two drawstring canvas bags</b> to store it all, and <b>batteries are included!  </b><br/></p>
<p><i>*Please note that although our current plan is to include each of these parts as they are described, we are still testing and improving the Catalyst. When we find ways to make it better, we'll make changes.</i></p>
<h4>What's In a 10-Pack?</h4>
<p>The 10-pack is a great way for schools, after-school programs, clubs and other organizations to get kids Tinkering. Each 10-pack will come packaged in a box that can be used for easy storage and will include 10 sets of the Catalyst parts mentioned above except for the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>One set of Challenge and Tip Cards</li>
<li>10 drawstring canvas bags (one for each type of part)</li>
<br/>
</ul>
<h4>Challenges, Not Instructions</h4>
<p>Tinkering is not about following directions — it’s about playing, experimenting, and finding your own way. This is what generates excitement in kids, and it’s also the source of learning and emotional benefits.</p>
<p>So the Electric Motors Catalyst does not come with instructions. But to get things started, it comes with a deck of <b>20 Challenge Cards</b> that kids, teachers, and parents can use for inspiration. Each challenge is kid-tested and can provide hours of engagement.</p>
<h4>Tips to Help You Along</h4>
<p>All inventors learn from the people around them and those who came before them. To help kids learn some basic building techniques that are useful for any challenge, the Electric Motors Catalyst includes a set of <b>10 Tip Cards</b>. And we hope that kids will share their own tips online once they have the Catalyst, so that the community of young Tinkerers can learn together.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Use it Again and Again</h4>
<p>The Electric Motors Catalyst is designed to be used over and over again.
  After you've built something, take a picture or video (and please 
share it with us!), and then take it apart and build something new. 
Gever always says, <b>""If you have parts, make something. If you have something, 
take it apart!""</b><br/></p>

</div>
<h4>The Electric Motors Catalyst is Just the Beginning</h4>
The Electric Motors Catalyst is our first, but we have 35 more Catalyst ideas on the drawing board, including:<br/><ul>
<li>Rubber-Band Power</li>
<li>Flight</li>
<li>Gears and Levers</li>
<li>Optics<br/>
</li>
<li>Gravity Power</li>

<h3>Our Story: 10 Years of Tinkering</h3>
Although Tinkering Labs is new, our history goes back 10 years to the day Gever started Tinkering School in his back yard. Take a look at the journey below:<br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1385868/files/20150415112153-Timeline_graphic4.jpg?1429122113"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>And over the years, we've received a lot of press:<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1288877/files/20150312005408-Tinker_Press_logos.png?1426146848"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk we face is in the cost of the Catalysts—currently, the parts in each Catalyst cost $40, which does not include assembly, packaging, or mailing. If we can get 1,000 pre-orders for the Electric Motors Catalyst, we can get significant discounts on bulk orders that will allow us to sell these at a price that almost any family, school or after-school program can afford.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Thank You!</h3>
<p>We want to send a big big THANK YOU to our friends at Brightworks, Tinkering School, the Girl Scouts of San Mateo County, the Exploratorium, Stanford d.school, Mark Day School and the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Sonoma Valley for helping us test and improve the Electric Motors Catalyst.

Tinkering For All!
As founder of Tinkering School, The Institute for Applied Tinkering and Brightworks, 10 years of Tinkering experience has taught me that kids can build anything, and through building, learn anything.

But not every kid can come to our school or camps. So we’ve started Tinkering Labs to make the problem-solving skills, knowledge and confidence that Tinkering enables available to all kids. Help us bring the pure joy of invention to a kid in your life by supporting the creation of our first kit: The Tinkering Labs ELECTRIC MOTORS CATALYST. Thank you, and #TinkeringForAll!

Gever Tulley 
Founder of Tinkering Labs


NEW: Get the Booster Pack for only $10!

We're in the last few days of the campaign, and we want to offer something special just for our early supporters. We call it the Electric Motors Booster Pack, and it’s available for just $10 through Sunday, May 31.




The Booster Pack includes a high-torque gear motor, two new wheels, three LEDs (white, red, and green) and conductive copper tape. It also comes with additional Challenge Cards that open a wide range of new capabilities for kids to explore.



THE GEAR MOTOR enables inventions that need more power or lower rotational speeds, including “creeping” robots, “chairlifts” that can climb up a string, and a huge variety of drawing machines. 


LED LIGHTS let kids build blinkers and dimmers, and the electrically minded might even figure out how to make a light glow without using a battery at all (hint: a motor can be a generator!). 


COPPER TAPE creates an enormous new range of electrical connections, and is especially useful for switches that make things that start and stop or blink or jiggle.

NEW CHALLENGES inspire even more engaging, creative possibilities!

Just $10 Through Sunday, May 31. For the last few days, the Electric Motors Booster Pack is available to our supporters for only $10. We want all of you to have a chance to add these amazing capabilities to your kits at a price that’s as affordable as possible. The Booster Pack will not be available at this price after the campaign is over. If you pre-ordered a Catalyst or 10-pack, pick up a Booster Pack now to multiply the possibilities!




Why Do Kids Need Tinkering? 




Because they are growing up in a world full of complex problems with no instruction booklet. Kids need experience working independently on open-ended 
projects that are goal-directed but unscripted.  By activating their 
hands and their minds, Tinkering helps kids develop the skills, knowledge and grit necessary to become the innovators their generation is going to need. Tinkering develops: 


Problem-solving skills

Adaptability and resilience


Collaboration with peers

An intuitive grasp of science, technology, engineering, art and math (STEAM) principles

The confidence that only comes from competence





Tinkering succeeds at imparting these skills because it has a secret weapon: it is pure natural fun! Human childhood evolved to make it fun for kids to use their hands and brains to figure out the physical world. Tinkering is literally what kids were born to do. 

Introducing Catalyst #1: Electric Motors


Our first Catalyst - Electric Motors - is a kit that makes it easy for parents and teachers to provide their kids with super-fun open-ended learning: what we call Tinkering!

What at first seems like a random set of items (motors, wooden parts, springs and bolts, rubber bands and washable markers) rapidly becomes a platform for innovation in the hands of kids.
What Can You Do With the Electric Motors Catalyst?

You can build a countless number of projects that utilize the power of electric motors. To help you get started, the Catalyst comes with a set of Challenge Cards to inspire kids to explore. Some of the challenges include: 
Build a machine that draws curvy lines

Build a vehicle that moves in a straight line

Build a machine that sends a message in Morse Code

Make a machine that can scramble an egg

Build a machine that can climb a string

Create something that makes a loud sound

Build a vehicle with a suspension system

...and many more. Here are just a few things kids have come up with so far in our prototype test sessions:





Who is it For?The kits are designed for boys and girls aged 6-13, but even adults have been known to spend hours Tinkering with the Catalyst. We've spent a great deal of time designing and testing so that any kid — regardless of experience — can engage quickly make something that captures their imagination. Whether a kid is a budding artist, poet, engineer, scientist, athlete, or dreamer, they will love creating things with the Catalyst.
With help from our friends in their homes, schools, scout troops, 
the Exploratorium, the Boys and Girls Club and Stanford University 
d.school, we’ve watched hundreds of kids invent using the Electric 
Motors Catalyst. In every Tinkering session, kids create things we never
 knew were possible. Who knows what your kids will invent?



Where Can You Use it?
At home, kids have a blast Tinkering on their own or with friends and siblings. In  schools, clubs and other group settings Catalyst 10-packs are a great way to provide students with open-ended learning experiences. The kits are designed for children to be able to work independently without help. The included Challenge and Tip Cards give kids just enough guidance to get started, and they make it easy for any adult to facilitate a Tinkerthon with 20 or more kids!


Why Does the Electric Motors Catalyst Work?
In an ideal Tinkering experience a child has fun right away, runs into problems, solves them, and is then inspired to do more. 10 years of projects and activities have taught us that incorporating the following principles leads to higher engagement and better outcomes:


Fast and tweakable: Parts are simple to attach, tweak and take apart so that kids can quickly and easily try different things.


Challenges, not instructions: We don't provide step-by-step instructions, but include Challenge and Tip Cards help kids get started and inspire them to create on their own inventions.


Real, not imaginary: We use recognizable hardware, tools and 
materials so that kids easily connect and incorporate the Catalyst with
 the objects in the world around them.


Safe: Carefully planned parts allow for freedom of exploration without the need for adult supervision.


Collaborative: Once we’re up and running, kids can join our online community where 
they can share ideas, learn from others, and provide 
support.

More About the Electric Motors Catalyst
What’s In the Box?




Each Electric Motors Catalyst includes the following pieces:


Custom-designed laser-cut wood parts. The “ladybug platform” inspires kids with an unusual shape and carefully designed arrangement of holes and tabs that makes all kinds of configurations possible.
Electric motors and battery pack. Both are equipped with kid-friendly connectors for high-speed trial and error. Batteries are included.
Real safety glasses. Because safety is a superpower!
Real screwdriver. Having your own real tools is a step toward independence.
Hardware and electrical connectors. Bolts, wing nuts, angle brackets, and springs create an amazing array of ways to assemble inventions and connect electrical circuits. Rubber bands let you connect it all together—and then take it all apart—fast.
Washable markers. Because it's fun to make machines that draw and  it's fun to draw on machines.
Challenge Cards for inspiration and Tip Cards that provide just the right amount of guidance. Can you build a machine that scrambles an egg? Or draws curvy lines? Or sends a message in Morse code? We think you can!

There are also two drawstring canvas bags to store it all, and batteries are included!  
*Please note that although our current plan is to include each of these parts as they are described, we are still testing and improving the Catalyst. When we find ways to make it better, we'll make changes.
What's In a 10-Pack?
The 10-pack is a great way for schools, after-school programs, clubs and other organizations to get kids Tinkering. Each 10-pack will come packaged in a box that can be used for easy storage and will include 10 sets of the Catalyst parts mentioned above except for the following changes:

One set of Challenge and Tip Cards
10 drawstring canvas bags (one for each type of part)


Challenges, Not Instructions
Tinkering is not about following directions — it’s about playing, experimenting, and finding your own way. This is what generates excitement in kids, and it’s also the source of learning and emotional benefits.
So the Electric Motors Catalyst does not come with instructions. But to get things started, it comes with a deck of 20 Challenge Cards that kids, teachers, and parents can use for inspiration. Each challenge is kid-tested and can provide hours of engagement.
Tips to Help You Along
All inventors learn from the people around them and those who came before them. To help kids learn some basic building techniques that are useful for any challenge, the Electric Motors Catalyst includes a set of 10 Tip Cards. And we hope that kids will share their own tips online once they have the Catalyst, so that the community of young Tinkerers can learn together.

Use it Again and Again
The Electric Motors Catalyst is designed to be used over and over again.
  After you've built something, take a picture or video (and please 
share it with us!), and then take it apart and build something new. 
Gever always says, ""If you have parts, make something. If you have something, 
take it apart!""



The Electric Motors Catalyst is Just the Beginning
The Electric Motors Catalyst is our first, but we have 35 more Catalyst ideas on the drawing board, including:

campaing ended on february the 13th and funds have since been 
transverred to my account. Needless

work to beginn.  We paid a visit to the town officials at the beginning 
of this week to inform them that we will start with the renovation and 
construction works. They were very happy and gave us the green light. 
The different craftsmen have also been contacted and work on site bginns
 this coming monday.So thank you very much once again and be sure to expect more updates as we progress.All the best from Korhogo,Christopher




Hello

my name is Chris Biller and I am currently working on an agricultural development
project in the north of the
Côte d'Ivoire. The project is funded by the German development cooperation and
our team’s main office is situated in Korhogo, the capital of the ""Savanes""
region.The region is finally starting to recover after several years of political
and socio-economic unrest and the recent peacefull elections
give hope for  continuous stability. Current development efforts in Korhogo mostly target basic social
and market infrastructure. However living
standards for the majority of the population are still low and unemployment, especially amongst
the youth, is high. The countries 4th
biggest town with around 200.000 inhabitants and an agricultural based economy is the capital of the Senufo people. Traditionaly art has allways played an important role in their culture and the region is
well known for its unique music,dance, paintings and weaving.  

What's the story ? 


While staying here, I have had the chance to get to know a team of artists
who collectively run a local art center called ""Centre Artistique de
Korhogo"". 

The place was established in 1998 and one of its main
goals is, to offer children and young adults, who have not had the chance to attend or complete
school, an alternative education in the arts. It' s a chance for them to get off the streets, to express themselves and to use their energy in a productive way. The creative
process provides a sense of serenity and lets the students discover the
profound values art conveys. Learning how to master a paintbrush, a
pencil, a pair of scissors, a chisel or fire also increases their self-esteem. 
At the same time the center serves as a workshop for artists who
produce and sell paintings, banners, various calligraphic work, screen prints,
decor, wooden or bronze sculptures and ""balafons"".

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello I am Coryn! Youngest of a family of 6. I come from Portland, Oregon and I have been unschooled all of my life. I have never gone to school for even a single day (unless you count going to play productions at theaters then I go all the time!)</p>
<p>I am trying to earn enough money to fly to Belgium. This will be my first major travel trip. I have only been out of the country once before and that was to Canada. I really want to travel as my older sister has travelled to Australia and Alaska and many other places. I suspect that she passed the travelling itch to me!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was going to go to Liberia, Africa this Summer but my mother had a seizure a month before I was going to go and the hospital bills have kind of just soaked up all of my family's extra money plus I wanted to hang out around and stay close with her while she recovered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The family I was going to stay with has offered to have me to come stay with them in Belgium and I would really like to go. I can't afford it on my own though so any amount you can donate would help so much. Thank you!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $600 to pay for my half of the ticket to Belgium! I am working on house sitting and baby sitting and mowing lawns around the neighberhood and looking for gigs on craigslist but there is not much for a 17 year old who is going to travel in less then 2 months! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My perks!</p>
<p>If you live local then I have quite a few pretty good perks for you! My father is a retired Chiropractor that would be happy to work on you, I can give you a massage, perhaps take your dogs for a walk or house sit for you? </p>
<p>If you don't live local well there are still lots of options! I can bring you back a speciality from Belgium (perhaps some real Belgian chocolate straight from Belgium or a mug!)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If I can earn the $600 for the ticket then I will go to Belgium in September where I will live for close to a month. From there I will either stay in Belgium or possibly go to Liberia, Africa. This will be that trip for me that I remember 10-15 years down the line with fond memories. It will be the trip that I think I will mature from being a teenager tod becoming more of an adult.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate then if you could just share it on your facebook or your twitter or just talk about it with your friends. Even if you can't donate you can still help lots. Thank you so much!</p>

<p>Childhood
is under assault. Quality family time is compromised by extended parental work
hours; pressure has increased for kids to “specialize” and compete; and the
constant presence of TV, video games, and social media is rapidly changing  social norms and undermining the experience of
childhood. Consider that . . .  </p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We believe deeply that childhood matters.
As a team of pediatricians, counselors, educators, and writers, we’re concerned

age-old truth confirmed by recent research: </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">To flourish, kids need REAL face-to-face connection.</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> It’s also true that the less time kids spend

to communicate, negotiate, and mediate

<p></p>
<p>Above all
else, <b>kids need REAL relationships in
their lives to thrive, be happy, and successful! </b>They also need opportunities
to develop key skills such as empathy and grit. These important qualities are learned through face-to-face relationships and from life’s ups and
downs—from the messy, indispensable, rollercoaster of REAL experience. For
example, if we don’t teach, learn about, and practice empathy, we run the risk of not being able to solve our problems as a
society—whether it’s bullying in schools or healing conflicts on <span>a grander scale. Ponder this sad statistic . . .</span></p></span><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Childhood
is under assault. Quality family time is compromised by extended parental work
hours; pressure has increased for kids to “specialize” and compete; and the
constant presence of TV, video games, and social media is rapidly changing  social norms and undermining the experience of
childhood. Consider that . . .  






We believe deeply that childhood matters.
As a team of pediatricians, counselors, educators, and writers, we’re concerned
about how changing norms impact kids today, and we advocate a return to an
age-old truth confirmed by recent research: To flourish, kids need REAL face-to-face connection. It’s also true that the less time kids spend
authentically interacting with others, the less practice they get learning how
to communicate, negotiate, and mediate
the inevitable conflicts of life. This leads to dire consequences such as . . .





Above all
else, kids need REAL relationships in
their lives to thrive, be happy, and successful! They also need opportunities
to develop key skills such as empathy and grit. These important qualities are learned through face-to-face relationships and from life’s ups and
downs—from the messy, indispensable, rollercoaster of REAL experience. For
example, if we don’t teach, learn about, and practice empathy, we run the risk of not being able to solve our problems as a
society—whether it’s bullying in schools or healing conflicts on a grander scale. Ponder this sad statistic . . .









As caring
adults, we must protect the building blocks of kids’ vitality and wellness. Outdoor play, family ties, safe havens, creativity, and rituals—these critical assets are especially vulnerable in a
time of unprecedented busyness and ever-present media influence. To
assist parents, grandparents, educators, and counselors in helping their
children navigate the complexity of
fostering relationships, we have written an inspiring guide: Face to Face: Cultivating Kids' Social Lives in Today's Digital World. The more people who read our book or hear our authors speak, the sooner we can shift the consciousness toward the value of REAL relationships in our kids’ lives.

<p><b><i>The Spirit of Mawson</i></b></p>
<p><b>THE AUSTRALASIAN ANTARCTIC
EXPEDITION 2013-2014</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Let’s get more students down to Antarctica</b></p>
<p>2013-2014 marks the centenary of the Australasian Antarctic
Expedition led by the great scientist and explorer Sir Douglas Mawson. In a celebration
of this remarkable endeavour, the new Australasian Antarctic Expedition (or AAE
for short) will follow the route of its namesake, melding science and
adventure, to discover and communicate the changes that have taken place in
this remote environment over the last hundred years. Led by Professor Chris
Turney and Dr Chris Fogwill, from the University of New South Wales, Sydney,
the 2013-2014 expedition will work its way across the Southern Ocean and
attempt to reach the original AAE Base at Cape Denison, Antarctica, at the
enigmatically named <b>‘Home of the Blizzard’</b>. </p>
<p>The Antarctic expeditions of old would routinely advertise for
applicants to join them in the south. Exciting – and often wonderfully
sensational – proclamations would be placed in the broadsheets, appealing to
national sense of duty to scientifically explore the newly discovered continent
in the Southern Ocean. Posting calls in the press helped team leaders fill key
positions in their party while also maintaining a high public profile, crucial for
raising much needed funds. Mawson was no exception in this
regard. Adverts for the original Australasian Antarctic Expedition included
open meetings in state capitals and an appeal by Shackleton in the British
newspapers. The public responded enthusiastically to the scale of the
expedition: four bases spread out along a near-unknown Antarctic coastline.
Here was a venture everyone could get involved in, either directly as a team
member or by sponsoring essential supplies and equipment.</p>
<p>Inspired by the
efforts of Mawson and his men to communicate their<span>
scientific findings to a public hungry to learn more, we recently advertised
for 4 PhD positions to join the expedition. Applicants had to send in a
two-minute YouTube movie clip to tell us why they wanted to join the expedition
and how they would help convey our discoveries to the rest of the world. The
response has been overwhelming. The deadline has now passed and 67 applications
have been received. We have been blown away by the quality of the films while
the range of expertise and nationality is simply fantastic; we have
applications from around the world including Australasia, the USA, Chile and
Europe, promising a fabulous international mix on board our vessel, the MS <i>Shokalskiy</i>.
We are incredibly excited about helping support a new generation keen to
communicate our results with the rest of the world. We would love to take more
students south but just don’t have the funds. Given the scale of interest we
are keen to offer more PhD students the opportunity of joining us on the
expedition, but to do this we need financial support. The aim of this Indiegogo
campaign is to raise enough money to support four more PhD students the chance
to come to the Antarctic with us! </span></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>To extend the number of students we can take south with us, we
need to cover the costs of two berths on the second leg of the expedition at $16,900
AUD each, totaling some $27,800 AUD. We really hope that you can help us reach
our target, but if we undershoot at least we will be able to give some more
students the chance of a lifetime to come south with us on this unique
expedition!</p>
<p>The concept of crowd funding with Indiegogo harks back to
Mawson‘s original Antarctic expedition one hundred years ago, where many
expedition items — including huskies, tents and sleeping bags — were funded by
schools and public donations from across the world! To attract potential
supporters we are able to offer a number of unique gifts and perks, ranging
from limited edition t-shirts, exclusive photographic prints and signed books. </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The Australasian Antarctic Expedition 2013-2014 is all about
adventure, exploration, scientific discovery, and importantly communication.
The AAE aims to engage with a broad audience live from Antarctica and the
Southern Ocean throughout the expedition. Through a variety of media, including
Google+ Hangouts on Air, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, we will broadcast live
using the latest satellite technology to support live streaming from Antarctica.
 </p>
<p>The Antarctic remains one of the last great unexplored regions
on our planet. In spite of over a century of discovery – including aerial and
satellite surveys – remarkably little of this great continent has been explored
on the ground. Crucially this pristine southern polar region is uniquely placed
to monitor the health of our planet. <b>The Australasian Antarctic
Expedition (AAE) will focus its efforts on the Antarctic Commonwealth Bay and
subantarctic islands to provide the first complete snapshot of this region for
a century.</b></p>
<p>The AAE has identified a team of scientists who are world
experts in the natural and physical sciences while also being passionate about
science communication. The research programmes to be undertaken include:</p>
<p><i>1. Oceanography:</i> The Southern Ocean plays
a crucial role in global climate and the carbon cycle. 90% of the world’s
excess heat trapped by the atmosphere is going into the ocean and changing
circulation patterns, threatening to turn the region into a source of carbon,
exaggerating future warming. <b>The AAE will make detailed measurements on
the passage south (e.g. temperature, salinity, carbon) to determine just how
sensitive the Southern Ocean is to change.</b></p>
<p><i>2. Climate: </i>The ‘screaming sixties’, the
‘furious fifties’ and the ‘roaring forties’ filled sailors of old with dread.
And yet these fearsome westerly winds are migrating inexorably southwards
taking warmer water with them, threatening the stability of Antarctic
ice. <b>The AAE will collect peat, ice and rock samples to place satellite
data in the context of the past millennia.</b></p>
<p><i>3. Biology: </i>Recent expeditions to the
Southern Ocean and Antarctica continue to report the discovery of thousands of
new species, while living and ‘fossil’ animal and plant remains provide a
sensitive measure of the changing environment. <b>The AAE will observe,
document and monitor the wildlife above and below the Antarctic ice, giving new
insights into this unexplored region.</b></p>
<p><b>By supporting our campaign you will be helping us achieve our goal
of conveying science in real time from one of the most extreme and challenging
environments on our planet. The students will help support science on the ice, providing
a unique perspective for understanding and communicating change in the Southern
Ocean and Antarctica.</b></p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Whilst
not everyone can contribute directly to this campaign, we would love you to
join us on the AAE. For more information of how to join the expedition either
virtually or in person please go to <a href=""http://www.spiritofmawson.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.spiritofmawson.com</span></a>. Please spread the word
with your friends, either through our web page, or with the Indiegogo share
tools!!!</p>

need to cover the costs of two berths on the second leg of the expedition at $16,900
AUD each, totaling some $27,800 AUD. We really hope that you can help us reach
our target, but if we undershoot at least we will be able to give some more
students the chance of a lifetime to come south with us on this unique
expedition!
The concept of crowd funding with Indiegogo harks back to
Mawson‘s original Antarctic expedition one hundred years ago, where many
expedition items — including huskies, tents and sleeping bags — were funded by
schools and public donations from across the world! To attract potential
supporters we are able to offer a number of unique gifts and perks, ranging
from limited edition t-shirts, exclusive photographic prints and signed books. 
The Impact
The Australasian Antarctic Expedition 2013-2014 is all about
adventure, exploration, scientific discovery, and importantly communication.
The AAE aims to engage with a broad audience live from Antarctica and the
Southern Ocean throughout the expedition. Through a variety of media, including
Google+ Hangouts on Air, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, we will broadcast live
using the latest satellite technology to support live streaming from Antarctica.
 
The Antarctic remains one of the last great unexplored regions
on our planet. In spite of over a century of discovery – including aerial and
satellite surveys – remarkably little of this great continent has been explored
on the ground. Crucially this pristine southern polar region is uniquely placed
to monitor the health of our planet. The Australasian Antarctic
Expedition (AAE) will focus its efforts on the Antarctic Commonwealth Bay and
subantarctic islands to provide the first complete snapshot of this region for
a century.
The AAE has identified a team of scientists who are world
experts in the natural and physical sciences while also being passionate about
science communication. The research programmes to be undertaken include:
1. Oceanography: The Southern Ocean plays
a crucial role in global climate and the carbon cycle. 90% of the world’s
excess heat trapped by the atmosphere is going into the ocean and changing
circulation patterns, threatening to turn the region into a source of carbon,
exaggerating future warming. The AAE will make detailed measurements on
the passage south (e.g. temperature, salinity, carbon) to determine just how
sensitive the Southern Ocean is to change.
2. Climate: The ‘screaming sixties’, the
‘furious fifties’ and the ‘roaring forties’ filled sailors of old with dread.
And yet these fearsome westerly winds are migrating inexorably southwards
taking warmer water with them, threatening the stability of Antarctic
ice. The AAE will collect peat, ice and rock samples to place satellite
data in the context of the past millennia.
3. Biology: Recent expeditions to the
Southern Ocean and Antarctica continue to report the discovery of thousands of
new species, while living and ‘fossil’ animal and plant remains provide a
sensitive measure of the changing environment. The AAE will observe,
document and monitor the wildlife above and below the Antarctic ice, giving new
insights into this unexplored region.
By supporting our campaign you will be helping us achieve our goal
of conveying science in real time from one of the most extreme and challenging
environments on our planet. The students will help support science on the ice, providing
a unique perspective for understanding and communicating change in the Southern
Ocean and Antarctica.
Other Ways You Can Help
Whilst
not everyone can contribute directly to this campaign, we would love you to
join us on the AAE. For more information of how to join the expedition either
virtually or in person please go to www.spiritofmawson.com. Please spread the word
with your friends, either through our web page, or with the Indiegogo share

<p><b>Seeking to raise funds for 12 week, 40+hr/week bootcamp style education in web development</b></p>
<p>Beginning June 2nd, I will be attending MakerSquare, a local web development bootcamp.  The program will last 12 weeks, which will include 40 hours per week of instruction, as well as additional evening &amp; weekend activities.  All told, I plan to spend at least 60 hours per week learning web development.  The program begins June 2nd and runs through August.</p>
<p>The program costs $13,880.  Living expenses will cost about $4,500 over 3 months.  The total is $18,380.  I already have $7,000, however I will need $11,000 more in order to cover the tuition payment, living expenses, and the fee IndieGogo charges.</p>
<p><b>Why learn at a web development bootcamp like MakerSquare?</b></p>
<p>The guidance provided at a web development bootcamp will accelerate my ability to make it through the steepest part of the learning curve.  It will also make my future self-directed study more effective, because I will have learned the best way to find solutions to problems/challenges I encounter when coding. </p><p> I will learn the thought process and problem structuring that is fundamental to being a developer.  Working with professionals will also expose me to professional conventions in software development and important tangential concepts, such as better understanding databases, servers, and operating systems.</p>
<p> Learning web development on my own has been a slow and tedious process, without any guidance through the vast maze of information, much of it outdated.  It has been a slow, ineffective journey, which is why I am turning to professionals. </p>
<p>Learning a curated, up-to-date curriculum of web development knowledge from industry experts will allow me to accelerate my learning and gain the skills necessary to build my own web applications, whether business software, an interactive educational site, or some other creative idea.</p>
<p>The education is project based, so I will be building web applications throughout the program.  I already have several ideas for web applications, in property management, education, event marketing, and many others.</p>
<p><b>With a background in online marketing &amp; web design, I am a great candidate for the program</b></p>
<p>I am in a great position to expand my skill-set.  I have been working at SolarWinds, Inc., one of Austin's fastest growing startup companies, for the past 6 months in Email Marketing, a tremendously important branch of the company's sales &amp; marketing arm.</p>
<p>Prior to this, I worked for 3 months at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt to help design an online web portal.  Before that, I worked on a group of websites including &amp; owned by PlasticMart.com.  This foundation of knowledge in web design and the online business ecosystem will support my ability to learn web development and create meaningful web applications.</p>
<p><b>Why do I want to build web applications?</b></p>
<p>I have many ideas for online-business and non-profit concepts.  Some of them seem almost impossible... and they will be impossible for me to achieve without web development skills.</p>
<p>As you may know, I used to be a bit of an environmental activist.  I still have a passion for environmental &amp; social entrepreneurship and activism, and this is another field which I would like to contribute to with improved skills in web development.</p>
<p>I believe there is and will continue to be increasing demand for web development professionals well into the future.  As I hone my skill, it is something I can offer to teach others as well.  So, by donating to my fund, you can be sure I will be happy to spend some time with you teaching you what I know (and what I am learning) about web development.  Also, as I become more financially stable and successful, I will be able to contribute to the funding needs of others, and l definitely intend to pass on the magnanimity to others.</p>

</div></div>","Help give our scholars a Graduation Trip they will never forget…!Real LIFE Foundation is a non-profit that is passionate about providing a better future for underprivileged Filipino youth by giving them access to a good education. We give our scholars more than just tuition & fees -- we mentor them in LIFE: Leadership, Integrity, Faith & Excellence; we equip them with practical life skills; and we provide them with a daily meal allowance. Real LIFE has been empowering the dreams of scholars across the Philippines since 2003.On April 8-9, we will hold our biggest Scholar Graduation ever! Forty-six Real LIFE scholars from 18 cities across the Philippines will come to Manila for our Scholar Graduation ""Mystery Tour."" Almost all of our graduates are the first in their family to obtain a university degree, and many have never stayed in a hotel before, so we want to make this an extra special Grad celebration memory that they will cherish for years to come. Our scholars have worked so hard (some have been scholars for 8 years) and overcome so much to be able to graduate. For our Scholar Graduation ""Mystery Tour,"" we will fly our 25 provincial graduates to Manila. Once in Manila, they will join our 21 Manila graduates for an ""Amazing Race"" (Grad Edition!) to our super secret grad venue outside the city.

I hope to fundraise as much as possible in order to minimize my out-of-pocket expenses, and minimize the amount of loans I will most likely have to take out to cover the remaining costs.There are unique ""perks"" offered with different donation amounts:
$25: Acknowledgement of your support! Thank you!
$50: A postcard sent to you from South Africa!
$100: An unique printed photo taken during my time in South Africa!
$200: A souvenir from South Africa
$500: Postcard, photograph and souvenir from South Africa
Can't Contribute Yourself? Please spread the word!Please share the link to my campaign with anyone you think would be interested in helping me fund my trip to South Africa! Do not hesitate to contact me directly with any questions about my campaign. I love talking about my future and about how this program would play a significant role in my studies and personal growth, and allow me to steps towards making differences in communities! Email: iamanda@sas.upenn.edu",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>How it Works</strong></h2>
<h3><em><strong>Parents/Guardians</strong></em></h3>
<p>GuidEd Parent is an affordable mobile application that will help parents/guardians track their student’s progress and manage a home support plan automatically by creating and monitoring expectations with rewards and consequences. When applied, a parent/guardian will have tools to provide positive and consistent support, thereby keeping the student’s success and character development at center stage.</p>
<h3><em><strong>Students</strong></em></h3>
<p>GuidEd Parent allows a student to stay organized, manage projects, and most of all gain encouragement from the ones who will mean the most, parents/guardians and close family members or friends that parents/guardians approve as support team members. GuidEd Parent is a tool that speaks the language of young people in a space they are most comfortable with. Your teen will appreciate the GuidEd Parent approach and will do their best to reach agreed upon goals and daily expectations.</p>

<h2><strong>Impact</strong></h2>
<p>Your donation will improve the educational experience of young people, as well as helping parents motivate their children in academics and help them instill the character traits of their dreams. Most of all, GuidEd Parent’s framework ensures that family support stays connected during times of separation. Service member families who are often deployed and/or moving will be able to keep their support consistent and involved no matter where they are in the world.</p>

Every student integrates  a series of skill building excersises, which are aimed at pushing them from a point of introversion to a confident,  self- respecting individual so that they can learn to express themselves creatively and interact with each other collaboratively. Each student receives private lessons and instruction based on their field of interest, while constructing a final performance event, which combines all fields of expertise within the program.</p>
<p>The final event will combine musical, dance, and thematic elements from both traditional aboriginal society and contemporary art. Mzany of the students have struggled through such incredible hardships that they are heavily burdened by depression and the belief that their purpose is not understood by anyone. The Soar program aims to nurture and inspire these students by working directly with them on a personal level. In this way we engage students to open themselves up to creativity and realize their leadership potential so they may grow to pursue a passion and inspire others.</p>
<p>Currently the program works primarily with the youth of the Enoch Cree nation in Alberta, Canada. The program has grown exponentially over 5 years, each year raising the bar in production value and quality. The youth involved in this program have gone above and beyond the initiative necessary to bring a professional product to life. Your contribution will aid in directly making the vision of this performance a possibility. The costs of the final performance is strenuous. Much is involved in the process; from the costumes, to the set design, to the labour in the venue, we truly believe that it is worth every dollar to give these students a life changing experience. Any contributions beyond what what is necessary for the performance will go directly towards our vision of making a lasting impact on aboriginal art. Forever.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that this kind of inspiration is something that has to be shared with all people. Therefore it is especially influential to those who have never experienced what it means to feel significant and important. This is our mission. Thank you for your consideration toward helping us bring an amazing performance within a permanent sustainable program available to all the First Nation's youth.</p>

<p>Since 2008, Ear Candy has conducted Instrument Drives at fire stations throughout the Phoenix metropolitan area, collecting and placing thousands of instruments and impacting tens of thousands of youth to date. </p>
<p>In order to expand the impact of Instrument Drives beyond the Phoenix area, Ear Candy has spent the past year and a half building Online Instrument Drives. The program is has been developed to the point where it can take an instrument donated from anywhere in the country and place it in any music program in Arizona. </p>
<p>YOUR compassionate support for this campaign will ensure Ear Candy has the funds it needs to launch and operate Online Instrument Drives on September 17th, 2012.</p>

<h3>Music Education Matters</h3>
<p>Participation in music education provides many benefits for students, including heightened academic performance in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), increased self-esteem, the development of team building and social skills, and has been shown to produce a strong correlation with higher socioeconomic status in adulthood.<br/><br/>Yet, across the country, thousands of youth each year miss out on music classes because they cannot afford to purchase or rent an instrument. The advantages of music education are far too numerous to deny any student the opportunity, especially when financial circumstances outside of their control hinder their access.<br/><br/><strong>That’s where Online Instrument Drives comes in, and why we need your support.</strong><br/><br/>If you believe music education is important for students, then please help give old instruments new life by supporting this campaign!<br/><br/><em><strong>And...</strong></em><br/>Since Ear Candy's a nonprofit, you get a <em>charitable tax receipt</em> for all contributions made through this campaign. <em><strong>YOU</strong></em> <em><strong>MUST CHOOSE PAYPAL AT CHECKOUT TO RECEIVE A TAX RECEIPT!!</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>
<em>Launching -</em> September 17th</h2>
<p><strong>Online Instrument Drives</strong> (<strong>OID</strong>) - an easy to use donation platform hosted on Ear Candy’s website that allows individuals in the community to donate instruments to music programs that need them most.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt=""OID Process"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://earcandycharity.org/Files/OID_Process_white.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""OID Process""/></p>
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<ol>
<li>Music teachers create an instrument request, post a photo of their students, and describe their need for the instruments.</li>
<li>Instrument donors choose the music program where they want to donate their instrument, print a free shipping label, and send their instrument on its way.</li>
<li>Instruments arrive at Ear Candy's facility for cleaning, tuning, and repair.</li>
<li>Financial donors chip in to cover shipping and repair (like a micro Indiegogo campaign for each instrument).</li>
<li>When the funds are raised, instruments arrive at the music program and are immediately placed in the hands of a child!</li>
</ol><p>It’s really that simple, and it works the same whether an instrument is donated from across town or across the country.</p>
<p>So on September 17th, no matter where you are in the U.S., you can give an old instrument <em>New Life</em> through Online Instrument Drives. </p>

<hr/><h3>Donate an Instrument Now</h3>
<p>Online Instrument Drives is launching in Maricopa County, AZ on September 17th, and expanding throughout the state of AZ in January 2013. </p>
<p>If you live in the continental U.S., you can donate an instrument to a music program anywhere in AZ. And with AZ ranked 48th out of 50 states in per-person educational funding, music programs here need all the support they can get!</p>
<h3>National Expansion</h3>
<p>Ear Candy built OID to be scalable – nationally and fast. In fact, the system is already capable of placing an instrument in any music program in the country. With enough interest and support from outside of Arizona, we will be placing instruments from coast to coast in no time at all!</p>
<h3>Use of Funds</h3>
<p>We have spent the past year and a half building Online Instrument Drives from scratch on a shoestring budget. In order for the program to work, it is critical that Ear Candy raises <strong>$25,000 </strong>to launch and operate Online Instrument Drives. These funds are essential to the implementation and success of the program. </p>
<p>Case in point, Ear Candy needs <strong>$421,800</strong> for the year to keep the lights on and instruments flowing. </p>
<p>All funds raised in excess of the campaign goal will go directly toward ongoing web development and program operations.</p>
<p>Contribute to this campaign, and together we will ensure all youth have access to music education!! </p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>In early 2007, Nate Anderson  came across a startling statistic: Arizona was nearly dead last in per person educational funding in the country. As a music enthusiast, Nate began to research the effects of such dismal funding levels on music education in Arizona’s public schools. What he found would change his life forever. In October of 2007, Nate founded Ear Candy Charity as a <a href=""http://www.earcandycharity.org/Files/501C3%20APPROVED.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">501(c)(3) Non-Profit</a> dedicated to providing youth access to music education.</p>
<p>Nate initially hosted benefit concerts and events to raise money to support music education, and soon refined the organization's approach by conducting Valley wide instrument drives with 80+ fire station donation sites, which led to delivering truckloads of instruments to schools in need.</p>
<p>In early 2011, Ear Candy embarked on the exciting challenge of revamping physical Instrument Drives to increase efficiency and effectiveness and expand the program's impact. Online Instruments Drives soon emerged as the organic evolution physical Instrument Drives by leveraging technology and emerging trends in online fundraising.  </p>
<p>Putting all the logistical pieces of Online Instrument Drives in place along with web design and a solid customer relations management (CRM) backbone took a good deal of time treasure, leading us to today, with a fundraising campaign preceding the launch of the program.  </p>

Since 2008, Ear Candy has conducted Instrument Drives at fire stations throughout the Phoenix metropolitan area, collecting and placing thousands of instruments and impacting tens of thousands of youth to date. 
In order to expand the impact of Instrument Drives beyond the Phoenix area, Ear Candy has spent the past year and a half building Online Instrument Drives. The program is has been developed to the point where it can take an instrument donated from anywhere in the country and place it in any music program in Arizona. 
YOUR compassionate support for this campaign will ensure Ear Candy has the funds it needs to launch and operate Online Instrument Drives on September 17th, 2012.

You can clik the image below to watch this video, or checkout the update section to see them all. (Warning - Some of them are ridiculous and may lead to laughter and smiling)

Music Education Matters
Participation in music education provides many benefits for students, including heightened academic performance in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), increased self-esteem, the development of team building and social skills, and has been shown to produce a strong correlation with higher socioeconomic status in adulthood.Yet, across the country, thousands of youth each year miss out on music classes because they cannot afford to purchase or rent an instrument. The advantages of music education are far too numerous to deny any student the opportunity, especially when financial circumstances outside of their control hinder their access.That’s where Online Instrument Drives comes in, and why we need your support.If you believe music education is important for students, then please help give old instruments new life by supporting this campaign!And...Since Ear Candy's a nonprofit, you get a charitable tax receipt for all contributions made through this campaign. YOU MUST CHOOSE PAYPAL AT CHECKOUT TO RECEIVE A TAX RECEIPT!!
 

Launching - September 17th
Online Instrument Drives (OID) - an easy to use donation platform hosted on Ear Candy’s website that allows individuals in the community to donate instruments to music programs that need them most.

How it Works

Music teachers create an instrument request, post a photo of their students, and describe their need for the instruments.
Instrument donors choose the music program where they want to donate their instrument, print a free shipping label, and send their instrument on its way.
Instruments arrive at Ear Candy's facility for cleaning, tuning, and repair.
Financial donors chip in to cover shipping and repair (like a micro Indiegogo campaign for each instrument).
When the funds are raised, instruments arrive at the music program and are immediately placed in the hands of a child!
It’s really that simple, and it works the same whether an instrument is donated from across town or across the country.
So on September 17th, no matter where you are in the U.S., you can give an old instrument New Life through Online Instrument Drives.

making images. Networking is one of the main concerns in our profession 
as many of us wish to go to graduate school and become an art 
professional. It is integral to our success to attend conventions and 
conferences to reach out into the photographic community and make 
connections with other professional photographers in order to obtain our
 goals.

We may have some funding from our University, however it is not enough to cover the full price of boarding fees for the twelve of us attending. We would like to stay in the hotel the conference is in and fit comfortable in three rooms instead of cramming six to a room. The $600 would help up attain that goal and board us all comfortably in three rooms. </p><p>Being artists, we would love to reward your generosity with a print of your choosing.

The $600 would help up attain that goal and board us all comfortably in three rooms. Being artists, we would love to reward your generosity with a print of your choosing. Sizing and price increments are as follows:$15 Donation, 4x6 inch postcard print$35 Donation, 8x10 inch print $50 Donation, 13x19 inch print$65 Donation, 16x20 inch print$80 Donation,  Two 13x19 inch prints$85 Donation, Square 20x20 inch Scott Pierce PrintOne of our photographers, Robert Dallas, would also like to offer a portrait session for a 4x5 print with a vintage look to the donation of $125.The ImpactBy donating to our cause, you will help a group of young professional photographers attain the goal of optimum networking opportunities and potentially helping a handful of us get into a graduate program at a top photography program. Attending a national conference about Photographic Education further deepens our passion to create art and expand our visual expression. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are unable to donate, please help us spread the word.

<p>""Practicing Languages, Advancing Youth""</p>
<p>My name is Siobhan, I am working with the Local AIESEC Committees across Southern Cone, (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay).</p>
<p>AIESEC is the worlds largest youth led, non-profit organisation and in Southern Cone we are running a project with a focus of <strong>""Practicing Languages, Advancing Youth in Southern Cone"" in a fun environment</strong>!</p>
<p>I have been lucky enough to travel and meet many incredible people through  my time in AIESEC; engaging with interesting people from different cultures is what drives me to explore the world around me and develop myself in the process. But when I was learning languages in school, I never connected with <strong>why</strong> learning languages was important. I never connected languages with the incredible experiences I have been lucky enough to have while growing up. </p>
<p>Project <strong>PLAY in Southern Cone</strong> aims to break that mindset in schools here, to show children that <strong>not only can learning languages be fun, but languages open up adventures and experiences</strong> that would otherwise not be possible. Languages allow us to <strong>engage with and learn about people, about cultures, about the world around us</strong>.</p>
<p>We will achieve this by bringing at least <strong>45 volunteers</strong> from different countries around our international network to different Local Committees across Southern Cone for a <strong>6 week project between December and February</strong>. They will connect with the children, play games, teach them about their cultures and encourage the children to share their own. <strong>The children will have fun, engage with different cultures and practice their english at the same time</strong>.</p>
<p>As an international organisation we have <strong>60 years experience in sharing of cultures through sending people to 110 countries around the globe</strong>. Within this region our local commitees have experience in running <strong>successful education projects</strong>. We have the <strong>drive, passion and experience</strong> to run the kinds of sessions which will truly impact these children both in their <strong>language studies</strong>, and in their <strong>personal development.</strong></p>
<p>But we cant do this alone, the volunteers will pay for their own flights and visas, but <strong>we need your support</strong> to pay for their food and travel to work, and to help cover the general running costs of the project, (this project is a <strong>not for profit</strong> project). Assuming these 45 volunteers each work with a group of 25 children during their 6 weeks here, the team will impact <strong>1125 children</strong>!</p>
<p>If you donate, we will be happy to send you a virtual newsletter during the project,<strong> showing you exactly what we acheived</strong> thanks to your contribution. Our target is US$2000.<strong> </strong>But every penny counts,<strong> just US$2 represents one child</strong> impacted by this project! </p>

<h3>This is <strong>Y</strong>!</h3>
<p>Hey my name is Yasin Muhammad. I am 14 years old and live in Upper Darby,PA. I am campaigning to raise money in order to cover my tuition and expenses for the high school I've been accepted into for the 2012-2013 school year.</p>
<p>The school I've been accepted to is Youth Now on Top Academy, located in Philadelphia, PA. The school is geared toward the development of young entreprenuers like myself. I am a designer, my company name is YOUNG PRO. I design athletic clothes, shoes and accessories for the youth. My passion for this came about partly from playing sports myself. I am a track runner, tennis, football and basketball player. I am also a realist, not everyone makes it to the pros, even if I do I'll need something to do when I retire.</p>
<p>My hopes are to be able to start a clothing line for young people while I'm still young myself. Y-NOT Academy will not only help me do that, but also teach me what its like to start and maintain a business.</p>
<p>By contributing to my education campaign you will be helping me to secure a future for myself and investing in the possibility of greatness for all that I can help in the future.</p>
<p><strong>YNOT</strong></p>
<p>The school I will be attending Youth Now on Top Academy (Y-NOT) is the perfect environment for me to learn in because I will have a more personallized education as well as help with starting my business. I will be introduced to so many new things and opportunities. With this new school and new opportunity comes a new challenge for my family.....TUITION and how to pay for it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Y Needs &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Thats where your help comes in. I will need $5000 for yearly tuition, $830 for public transportation costs (10 months of septa trans passes), and just about $200 for school uniform shirts and supplies for the entire year and the rest for fees. All money collected will go to my Y-NOT education for 2012-2016. If I receive money over my goal it will go toward seed money for my clothing company YOUNG PRO.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I want to THANK EVERYONE for taking the time to consider my campaign. If for whatever reason you cannot help me financially, please share this campaign with your family and friends. And Please continue to support the RISE of a YOUNG PRO!</p>

<p>My name is Chris von Roy, I live in Golden Bay, New Zealand and I need your support on this project. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">My background lies in science and medicine, particularly Immunology, and for over a decade of my life I have acted as a medical writer for various global publishing houses. I have worked on and edited several science textbooks, medical journals, biographies as well as fiction and poetry books. </span></p>
<p>My passion lies in exploring hidden themes in society. Especially those themes that are too taboo to be discussed in mainstream news outlets, but that nonetheless hold the key to what makes societies function the way they do. </p>
<p>The stuff that no one talks about.</p>
<p>Several months ago I was approached by a friend regarding a writing project. She had heard of my involvement with the NZ shark conservation book ""Shark Man"" (2014, Penguin Random House) and that I had acted as a ghost writer for book projects in the past.</p>
<p>This friend asked if I wanted to be involved in a more serious book project, one that dealt with drug addiction in its most damaging form. Without hesitating I agreed to take a look - what I found shocked and moved me profoundly. I was presented with several diaries from a kiwi mother who'd spent a large portion of her life married to a man who was addicted to the street drug known as crystal meth or 'P'. The diary accounts were so vivid and detailed that I questioned at first, whether or not I would be able to do the project justice and write a story that paid real tribute to the ghastly true life accounts. </p>
<p>I decided to give it a go and worked on these diaries for several months. The book ""A Life Less Lived"" is the result of this work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To date, this was the single most difficult project I have ever worked on. The subject matter was unbelievably intense and so hard to deal with that it gave me nightmares on most nights. I had no real personal experience to draw upon and seeing the story was going to be written from a woman's perspective, I also had to adjust my own mentality, world view and ultimately, writing style, in order to reflect this perspective.</p>
<p>What I found will not surprise you. This drug is the worst thing to ever have been created by our species. Crystal meth is the most addictive substance known to humankind and the real danger it poses is its stealth and 'supposed harmlessness'. A myth that is widespread among 'P' users. </p>
<p>The drug doesn't barrel over its user's life like heroin does, nor cause everything to go amok in a heart beat like cocaine does, no crystal meth initially enters your life as a harmless mood enhancer, helping you have more energy at work and also keeping you awake and energetic for longer. Subtly feeding your brain way more dopamine - our 'happy' neurotransmitter- than it was intended for. And slowly it takes a stranglehold of everything that means anything to you in your life. Your personality, values, family, job, house and ultimately your livelihood.</p>
<p>'Carey', the original author of the book, initially wrote down and recorded all of her thoughts in her diaries with the intent of one day maybe giving them to a physician, so they could be fashioned into a self-help book for drug addicts. What has evolved from this idea is a book that harbours all that and more - it is not so much a self-help book, but more a brazenly honest account of a family whose life gets derailed by this drug. A wake-up call for anyone who knows anyone who may be involved in a similar situation.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>There is so much stigma &amp; taboo attached to this drug, and drugs in general, that people often do not know who to turn to when they get impacted - they shun their parents, close friends and even physicians in fear of being labelled or worse, castigated as a ""drug user"".

<p>Our book aims to influence that scenario and bring the topic into a wider public discourse, where it belongs. Who knows how many women are in Carey's exact position right now, not knowing that walking away from their spouse and saving their family is the best option for them? </p>
<p>We have approached the NZ Drug Foundation and are keen to be collaborating with them on getting the book into the right hands and making it available to a larger audience. Even those who have never experienced the drug or its users - the book could be an eye opener, for one of the nightmares about addiction to crystal meth is that it usually only becomes obvious to outsiders once it's too late.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p><br/></p>
<p>Of course writing a book like this comes with some risks and challenges. The main one being that the identity of the main character and her family had to be concealed in such a way that it was not recognisable to anyone close to her. This was very difficult and challenging but I believe we managed to alter the story enough to be able to conceal identities whilst still remaining true to the actual story line.</p>
<p>The stigma that society throws at drug users and addicts is still very powerful. We wrote this book to help change that mindset - there is nothing wrong with being addicted to something, what is wrong, is when nobody steps up to help out the addict and worse, shuns them as if they were a stain on an otherwise pristine white shirt.</p>
<p>Marketing the story to the world could be a little daunting but not impossible. Through the NZ Drug Foundation, we aim to get into contact with other drug agencies around the world.</p>
<p>The fact that such a harrowing tale could ever have happened in New Zealand, one of the most beautiful countries on Earth, renders the story even more effective. You  may live in paradise, but it is your mind that gets to choose whether or not you recognise this. To date nearly 25 million people worldwide are addicted to methamphetamine - we want this book to be accessible to all of them!</p>
<p><i>New Zealand is up there with one of the highest per capita meth production and addiction rates in the whole world. </i></p>

“It is hard to understand addiction unless you have experienced it in yourself or someone close to you”

We are trying to market this book, based on a true story about meth addiction in New Zealand, to as large an audience as we possibly can. We thought you might be able to help us.
My name is Chris von Roy, I live in Golden Bay, New Zealand and I need your support on this project. My background lies in science and medicine, particularly Immunology, and for over a decade of my life I have acted as a medical writer for various global publishing houses. I have worked on and edited several science textbooks, medical journals, biographies as well as fiction and poetry books. 
My passion lies in exploring hidden themes in society. Especially those themes that are too taboo to be discussed in mainstream news outlets, but that nonetheless hold the key to what makes societies function the way they do. 
The stuff that no one talks about.
Several months ago I was approached by a friend regarding a writing project. She had heard of my involvement with the NZ shark conservation book ""Shark Man"" (2014, Penguin Random House) and that I had acted as a ghost writer for book projects in the past.
This friend asked if I wanted to be involved in a more serious book project, one that dealt with drug addiction in its most damaging form. Without hesitating I agreed to take a look - what I found shocked and moved me profoundly. I was presented with several diaries from a kiwi mother who'd spent a large portion of her life married to a man who was addicted to the street drug known as crystal meth or 'P'. The diary accounts were so vivid and detailed that I questioned at first, whether or not I would be able to do the project justice and write a story that paid real tribute to the ghastly true life accounts. 
I decided to give it a go and worked on these diaries for several months. The book ""A Life Less Lived"" is the result of this work.

To date, this was the single most difficult project I have ever worked on. The subject matter was unbelievably intense and so hard to deal with that it gave me nightmares on most nights. I had no real personal experience to draw upon and seeing the story was going to be written from a woman's perspective, I also had to adjust my own mentality, world view and ultimately, writing style, in order to reflect this perspective.
What I found will not surprise you. This drug is the worst thing to ever have been created by our species. Crystal meth is the most addictive substance known to humankind and the real danger it poses is its stealth and 'supposed harmlessness'. A myth that is widespread among 'P' users. 
The drug doesn't barrel over its user's life like heroin does, nor cause everything to go amok in a heart beat like cocaine does, no crystal meth initially enters your life as a harmless mood enhancer, helping you have more energy at work and also keeping you awake and energetic for longer. Subtly feeding your brain way more dopamine - our 'happy' neurotransmitter- than it was intended for. And slowly it takes a stranglehold of everything that means anything to you in your life. Your personality, values, family, job, house and ultimately your livelihood.
'Carey', the original author of the book, initially wrote down and recorded all of her thoughts in her diaries with the intent of one day maybe giving them to a physician, so they could be fashioned into a self-help book for drug addicts. What has evolved from this idea is a book that harbours all that and more - it is not so much a self-help book, but more a brazenly honest account of a family whose life gets derailed by this drug. A wake-up call for anyone who knows anyone who may be involved in a similar situation.

   What We Need & What You Get
Ok, so we have now finished the book. We deliberately put this campaign under ""Educational"" because that's how we see the book impacting its audience.
The book's protagonist ""Carey"" wanted this story written for people like her. When she first came into contact with the drug 'P' she knew nothing about it- there were no information handouts at the hospital nor was anyone in the news, radio or TV talking about the drug and its powerfully damaging effects on people's lives.Carey wanted people to be given an insight into what life is like with this drug - describe the ups and the downs and put these into perspective,We wanted this to be a passion project, so apologies for the lack of inventiveness when it comes to the ""perks"" - I guess being involved with something that could have such a positive effect on its readership and society, is a perk, yes even a blessing, in and of itself. So thank you!The other aspect that makes the ""perks"" so difficult, is the fact that drug addiction is such a taboo topic and many people wouldn't want their name associated with it - so offering big ""shout outs"" or giving people 'producer' status as perks, never really made much sense. So we've kept it minimal.The money we get from this campaign will be put towards funding a larger print run (1000+ books), helping with the distribution to libraries and rehab centres, communication and ultimately marketing efforts to get the book to as wide an audience as possible. Not only is the theme important, but the book itself is a good read and will entertain audiences as well as 'educate' them. A ""win-win"" if you will..

    The Impact 

There is so much stigma & taboo attached to this drug, and drugs in general, that people often do not know who to turn to when they get impacted - they shun their parents, close friends and even physicians in fear of being labelled or worse, castigated as a ""drug user"". Fear of losing one's job, reputation and the knowledge that it could affect the way one's family is treated, all results in our society being completely quiet about its existence (bar a few sensationalised news stories) and this has to change.
Our book aims to influence that scenario and bring the topic into a wider public discourse, where it belongs. Who knows how many women are in Carey's exact position right now, not knowing that walking away from their spouse and saving their family is the best option for them? 
We have approached the NZ Drug Foundation and are keen to be collaborating with them on getting the book into the right hands and making it available to a larger audience. Even those who have never experienced the drug or its users - the book could be an eye opener, for one of the nightmares about addiction to crystal meth is that it usually only becomes obvious to outsiders once it's too late.
We want our story to be read in every library, book store and drug counseling/rehabilitation clinic in New Zealand, and also the world.

<h3>Bref résumé<br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>L'Ecole ADE a besoin d'un coup de pouce !</p>Nous espérons pouvoir accumuler suffisamment d'argent pour pouvoir acheter des tables et des bancs pour les élèves de l'école. <br/>Nous avons beaucoup de tables cassés et dans la plupart des classes les élèves sont à 5 ou 6 sur un seul banc!<br/><br/>La construction de ces bancs nous coute 500 USD, non-seulement parce qu'on à besoin de plus que 20 tables et bancs, mais aussi parce qu'ils seront en bois et fabriqués à la main. Ces tables et bancs dureront pour des générations. <br/><br/>Nous avons plusieurs idées avec lequel nous utiliseront le reste de l'argent:<br/><ul>
<li>réparer le toit (pour qu'il ne pleuve plus dans l'école) et réparer (cimenter) le sol. En échange nous voudrons demander au propriétaire de diminuer le loyer. (on aimerait aussi installer des lumières et des ventilos dans chaque classe.)</li>
<li>

acheter des bics/stylos pour chaque classe, car il y a souvent des élèves qui n'ont pas les moyens d'acheter des bics/qui viennent à l'école avec des bics cassés. (chaque enseignant pourra prêter ces bics aux élèves et ensuite les récupérer à la fin du cours).</li>
<li>acheter des livres pédagogiques pour les enseignants (des livres qui pourront être utilisés pour faire leur cours, car les enseignants n'ont pas beaucoup de ressources.) Cela améliorait les cours énormément.</li>
<li>acheter des petites armoires pour chaque classe avec ses propres clés. (Chaque enseignant sera responsable pour l'armoire dans sa classe dans laquelle il aura plus facilement accès vers des fournitures scolaires.)</li>
<li>acheter des livres scolaires pour les élèves. Les enfants d'ADE ne possèdent que des cahiers et cela avancerait leur éducation, s'ils pourraient avoir leur propres livres scolaires, avec lesquels ils pourraient aussi étudier à la maison. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Notre école et ce dont elle a besoin<br/>
</h3>
<p>Dans la banlieue proche de Dakar, à Thiaroye, l'école
communautaire ADE tente de fournir aux enfants du quartier une alternative
entre école publique; insuffisante en places et en moyens, proposant des
classes de primaire de 100 élèves, et écoles privées; trop chères pour les
populations défavorisées. L'État sénégalais s'étant largement désengagé de
l'école primaire, il laisse les structures privées ou communautaires faire face
aux difficultés de financement. <br/><br/>Si les taux de scolarisation s'améliorent de
plus en plus, la qualité de la formation, elle, ne suit pas nécessairement le
mouvement. Le manque de ressources rend difficile à la fois la formation des
enseignants et l'offre de matériel nécessaire à la scolarité des élèves.
L'école, ayant pour principe d'accepter tous les élèves, même ceux ne pouvant
payer qu'occasionnellement, est soumise à ces financements sporadiques alors
que le loyer des locaux et les factures doivent être réglés chaque mois. Elle
menace donc régulièrement de fermer, avec un risque important de
déscolarisation pour les enfants, les autres écoles du quartier étant nettement
plus chères (4000 XOF en théorie – avec arrangements possibles selon les
situations de chacun-, contre 15 ou 20 000 XOF dans les autres écoles des
environs).</p>
<p>L'école ADE est active pour chercher des solutions ! Elle
postule aussi souvent que possible à des programmes d'aides divers ; elle fait
aussi régulièrement appel à des volontaires, profitant de leurs compétences
spécifiques pour l'administratif, la gestion informatique de la communication,
mais aussi les cours de langue aux professeurs comme aux élèves, les cours
d'alphabétisation, des enfants comme des parents, …</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438859951/sypq1aybbiscvy7qtgwi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Elle aurait néanmoins besoin d'un coup de pouce ! Avant
tout, les effectifs d'élèves ayant fortement augmenté ces dernières années, il
s'agirait de remplir des salles vides de tables et de bancs, voire de remplacer
ou réparer les anciens, tombant régulièrement et perturbant l'apprentissage et
la concentration des élèves. <br/></p>
<p>Ponctuellement, votre aide pourrait servir à compléter le
paiement des factures et les salaires des professeurs lorsque les frais
d'inscriptions fournis par les familles ne suffisent pas.<br/><br/></p>
<p><b>Tables-bancs :</b></p>
<p>15 (ou plus) x 25 000 Fcfa = 375 000 Fcfa = 576 euros</p>

Bref résumé



L'Ecole ADE a besoin d'un coup de pouce !Nous espérons pouvoir accumuler suffisamment d'argent pour pouvoir acheter des tables et des bancs pour les élèves de l'école. Nous avons beaucoup de tables cassés et dans la plupart des classes les élèves sont à 5 ou 6 sur un seul banc!La construction de ces bancs nous coute 500 USD, non-seulement parce qu'on à besoin de plus que 20 tables et bancs, mais aussi parce qu'ils seront en bois et fabriqués à la main. Ces tables et bancs dureront pour des générations. Nous avons plusieurs idées avec lequel nous utiliseront le reste de l'argent:
réparer le toit (pour qu'il ne pleuve plus dans l'école) et réparer (cimenter) le sol. En échange nous voudrons demander au propriétaire de diminuer le loyer. (on aimerait aussi installer des lumières et des ventilos dans chaque classe.)


acheter des bics/stylos pour chaque classe, car il y a souvent des élèves qui n'ont pas les moyens d'acheter des bics/qui viennent à l'école avec des bics cassés. (chaque enseignant pourra prêter ces bics aux élèves et ensuite les récupérer à la fin du cours).
acheter des livres pédagogiques pour les enseignants (des livres qui pourront être utilisés pour faire leur cours, car les enseignants n'ont pas beaucoup de ressources.) Cela améliorait les cours énormément.
acheter des petites armoires pour chaque classe avec ses propres clés. (Chaque enseignant sera responsable pour l'armoire dans sa classe dans laquelle il aura plus facilement accès vers des fournitures scolaires.)
acheter des livres scolaires pour les élèves. Les enfants d'ADE ne possèdent que des cahiers et cela avancerait leur éducation, s'ils pourraient avoir leur propres livres scolaires, avec lesquels ils pourraient aussi étudier à la maison. 



Notre école et ce dont elle a besoin

Dans la banlieue proche de Dakar, à Thiaroye, l'école
communautaire ADE tente de fournir aux enfants du quartier une alternative
entre école publique; insuffisante en places et en moyens, proposant des
classes de primaire de 100 élèves, et écoles privées; trop chères pour les
populations défavorisées. L'État sénégalais s'étant largement désengagé de
l'école primaire, il laisse les structures privées ou communautaires faire face
aux difficultés de financement. Si les taux de scolarisation s'améliorent de
plus en plus, la qualité de la formation, elle, ne suit pas nécessairement le
mouvement. Le manque de ressources rend difficile à la fois la formation des
enseignants et l'offre de matériel nécessaire à la scolarité des élèves.
L'école, ayant pour principe d'accepter tous les élèves, même ceux ne pouvant
payer qu'occasionnellement, est soumise à ces financements sporadiques alors
que le loyer des locaux et les factures doivent être réglés chaque mois. Elle
menace donc régulièrement de fermer, avec un risque important de
déscolarisation pour les enfants, les autres écoles du quartier étant nettement
plus chères (4000 XOF en théorie – avec arrangements possibles selon les
situations de chacun-, contre 15 ou 20 000 XOF dans les autres écoles des
environs).
L'école ADE est active pour chercher des solutions ! Elle
postule aussi souvent que possible à des programmes d'aides divers ; elle fait
aussi régulièrement appel à des volontaires, profitant de leurs compétences
spécifiques pour l'administratif, la gestion informatique de la communication,
mais aussi les cours de langue aux professeurs comme aux élèves, les cours
d'alphabétisation, des enfants comme des parents, …


Elle aurait néanmoins besoin d'un coup de pouce ! Avant
tout, les effectifs d'élèves ayant fortement augmenté ces dernières années, il
s'agirait de remplir des salles vides de tables et de bancs, voire de remplacer
ou réparer les anciens, tombant régulièrement et perturbant l'apprentissage et
la concentration des élèves. 
Ponctuellement, votre aide pourrait servir à compléter le
paiement des factures et les salaires des professeurs lorsque les frais
d'inscriptions fournis par les familles ne suffisent pas.
Tables-bancs :
15 (ou plus) x 25 000 Fcfa = 375 000 Fcfa = 576 euros

In English: ADE school needs a helping hand!We hope to be able to receive enough money to be able to buy tables and benches for the students of the school.We have many broken tables and benches and in most classes there are 4-5 students sitting on one single bench!The construction of these benches would cost us 500 USD, not only because we need to buy more than 20 tables and benches, but also because these will be hand-made and out of wood.

<p><strong>I'm Joni.</strong> </p>
<p>Here is the abbreviated version of what you need to know:</p>
<p><strong>I'm making a trip to Kenya next month</strong> and visiting my friend Katy, who is working with an organization called Omwabini. (Click <a href=""http://www.omwabini.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> to learn about their orphanage and community work.)</p>
<p><strong>Katy made a recent discovery</strong>: when asked to talk to some young women about sanitary products, she realized that <em><strong>she was probably the ﬁrst person to ever have a discussion with them</strong></em> about menstruation because they had all lost their mothers when they were young. A 15 minute training turned into a 2 hour dialogue about the heartbreaking struggle surrounding this topic. </p>
<p>She shared these stories with me and <strong>we continued to dig deeper into this issue together</strong>. We discovered that girls in Kenya are <u>missing 20% of their education because they lack resources</u> to manage their period. For personal stories about this unspoken struggle, watch this video. Even just two minutes of watching will give you a clear picture of the reality for these girls.  </p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/1hn822TrKXo?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div> <p></p>
<p>These stories and statistics <strong>broke my heart and piqued my interest</strong>. I'm a social worker in Grand Rapids, Michigan where I support moms during their pregnancy and as they raise their young ones. I love my job and am passionate about helping women understand their bodies during this season of their lives. <strong><em>This passion led to researching how to support the young women at Omwabini.</em></strong> </p>
<h4>There is a great solution!</h4>
<p><em>Let me introduce you to... <a href=""http://www.ruby-cup.com/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ruby Cup!</a>(click here, explore their site, and learn what they are all about!)</em></p>
<p>They have a fantastic mission: <u>To provide a sustainable and healthy menstrual hygiene solution to women and girls world wide.</u>. </p>
<p>More fun facts about Ruby Cup: </p>
<p>-the company is based in Kenya</p>
<p>-they provide education and support with their product </p>
<p><strong><em>And get this . . .</em></strong> </p>
<p>-this one time purchase will provide <strong><em>10 whole years of worry free menstruation </em></strong><strong><em>management</em></strong>. We're talking middle school through college without missing one day of school because of this problem!</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><em>Here's what we want to do for the girls at Omwabini...</em></h4>
<p><strong>We want to raise $1,500.</strong></p>
<p>With your contribution, we will be able to provide the following for <em><strong>over 100 girls</strong></em>:</p>
<p>-holistic reproductive health <strong>education</strong> </p>
<p>-<strong>10 whole years</strong> of menstruation management via a menstrual cup</p>
<p>-the products necessary to <strong>keep this menstrual cup clean</strong>. </p>

I'm Joni. 
Here is the abbreviated version of what you need to know:
I'm making a trip to Kenya next month and visiting my friend Katy, who is working with an organization called Omwabini. (Click here to learn about their orphanage and community work.)
Katy made a recent discovery: when asked to talk to some young women about sanitary products, she realized that she was probably the ﬁrst person to ever have a discussion with them about menstruation because they had all lost their mothers when they were young. A 15 minute training turned into a 2 hour dialogue about the heartbreaking struggle surrounding this topic. 
She shared these stories with me and we continued to dig deeper into this issue together. We discovered that girls in Kenya are missing 20% of their education because they lack resources to manage their period. For personal stories about this unspoken struggle, watch this video. Even just two minutes of watching will give you a clear picture of the reality for these girls.   
These stories and statistics broke my heart and piqued my interest. I'm a social worker in Grand Rapids, Michigan where I support moms during their pregnancy and as they raise their young ones. I love my job and am passionate about helping women understand their bodies during this season of their lives. This passion led to researching how to support the young women at Omwabini. 
There is a great solution!
Let me introduce you to... Ruby Cup!(click here, explore their site, and learn what they are all about!)
They have a fantastic mission: To provide a sustainable and healthy menstrual hygiene solution to women and girls world wide.. 
More fun facts about Ruby Cup: 
-the company is based in Kenya
-they provide education and support with their product 
And get this . . . 
-this one time purchase will provide 10 whole years of worry free menstruation management. We're talking middle school through college without missing one day of school because of this problem!
 
Here's what we want to do for the girls at Omwabini...
We want to raise $1,500.
With your contribution, we will be able to provide the following for over 100 girls:
-holistic reproductive health education 
-10 whole years of menstruation management via a menstrual cup
-the products necessary to keep this menstrual cup clean. 
In the most basic way, here is the impact your contribution will make:
$12 = menstrual cup and education for 1 girl 
$25 = menstrual cup and education for 2 girls 
$50 = menstrual cup and education for 4 girls
$150 = menstrual cup and education for 12 girls
 
What we love about this project is that Omwabini and Ruby Cup are both investing in the lives of these girls. Omwabini will continue to provide education and vocational support and Ruby Cup will continue connecting with girls in this community. It's an ongoing relationship. 
It is our hope that through this project Omwabini will be a community of women empowered to continue in their education. A community of women with less shame and stigma attached to this normal, beautiful function of their bodies.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I am a Student Pilot from Nairobi, Kenya in East Africa and
I am training towards a Private Pilot Licence (PPL).</p>
<p>I have been attempting to join flying school since the year
2010 and I was not successful due to budget constraints until March 2012 when I
got a non-formal job in my city’s local authority and managed to save up enough
money to pay for Ground School. In a span of one year and six months, I have
managed to accomplish the following:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Covered extensive Ground School for both Private
Pilot Licence(PPL) and Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL).</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Passed the PPL ground examinations.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Passed the CPL ground examinations.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Secured an opportunity as an Assistant Ground
Instructor at my flying school.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Built 16 flight hours towards a Private Pilot
Licence (PPL).</p>
<p>I now work as an Assistant Ground Instructor at my flying
school and save all the money I earn and pay for flight training. This mode of
operation has brought me this far but it is not sustainable because I can only
afford two hours of flight instruction in a month. Therefore, I am in need of
funding to enable me fly in a consistent manner and complete my training
towards a Private Pilot Licence (PPL).</p>
<p>I am interested in
using my flying skills by participating in wonderful causes such as: wildlife
conservation. In Kenya, especially this year, wildlife is under serious threat
in the form of poaching. This is particularly so for elephants which are
targeted for ivory. The practice has adverse effects on the population of these
animals and if not stopped, it will lead to the extinction of elephants in a
few years to come.</p>
<p>In that regard, there are a number of initiatives that have
been put up by various wildlife conservation initiatives in order to address
this challenge. General Aviation aircraft are used in tracking the animals and
this is important as it identifies their position and in case they move out of
the conservancies, quick response to return them is possible before they get
exposed to poachers. </p>
<p>With a Private Pilot Licence (PPL), I will be in a position
to volunteer and make my contribution towards a cause that is dear not only to
my country but to humanity.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>I intend to raise $5,000 in order to complete the remaining bit of my flight training towards a Private Pilot Licence (PPL) which will afterwards enable me to be in a position to participate in wildlife conservation activities.</div>
<div>By supporting me in this cause, you stand to receive the wildlife merchandise in the form of: paintings, branded t-shirts and key holders.</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>This success of this campaign can be summarised as:</div>
<p></p>
<p>1. 
 In my
country, there are virtually no flight training scholarship opportunities as
compared to the U.S. Most people like myself, look up to these opportunities in
the U.S and most of the time fail to win any scholarship as majority are
reserved for U.S citizens only. The success of this campaign will enable me to
accomplish a goal that has been so evasive for a while. </p>
<p>2. 
The success of this campaign will not only be of
benefit to me in so far as a Private Pilot Licence (PPL) is concerned, it will
be a boost towards the various wildlife conservation initiatives since I am

will go a long way in safeguarding the population of wildlife which is an asset
to future generations.</p>

<p>Instead of hosting a huge expensive soiree - we are keeping it light and simple so everyone can enjoy a great night while supporting a fellow graduate living and coping with CF ( Cystic Fibrosis ). </p>
<p>Meghan Manuel was diagnosed with CF when she was just 11 months old. She is now a super mom raising three beautiful children (Aurora, Savanna and Grayson) amongst the everyday struggle and painful effects of CF.  In brief, her lungs fill up with a thick sticky mucus, which is an ideal breeding ground for bacteria - making it difficult to fight off infection. That same mucus blocks and destroys the digestive system. </p>
<p>Meghan's daily routine includes: 3 nebulized treatments, chest physiotherapy to clear mucus, daily and nightly internal tube feeding, diabetes management, and numerous medications. This means Meg is constantly fighting off infections, as well as complications that arise when dealing with CF. As the disease worsens, it makes it very difficult to work.  </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise awareness and give some comfort to a past panther in her fight against CF by donating all proceeds directly to Meg and her family.  </p>
<p>We can't do this without you and as the saying goes... a little goes a long way!!!</p>

<p>Snohomish County Music Project
engages a network of passionate musicians to promote artistic citizenship
within our community, expand access to music education in our schools, and use
the power of music therapy to improve the lives of our most vulnerable community
members - at risk youth, veterans and senior citizens. We have proudly reinvented ourselves by using music as a force
for positive changes within our community. Our intention is to create an
environment for musical expression while highlighting urgent needs and providing
grassroots solutions to community problems. </p>
<p>Music fosters individuality,
creativity, and a deep sense of fulfillment in young people and, as such,
should be an essential part of our educations system. Yet budget cuts continue
to reduce the availability of music education in our schools thus denying
students a holistic educational experience and access to important platforms
for creativity and self-expression. Expanding access to music education in our
schools has never been more important. </p>
<p><b>How we are doing it:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Building demand for music programs among children and
     families.</li>
<li>Building support for music programs among community
     leaders.</li>
<li>Building capacity to help schools increase music
     programs.</li>
</ul><h3><b>What is Link Up</b></h3>
<p>Link Up is a program provided in
partnership with the famed Carnegie Hall, which pairs orchestras across the
country with elementary students at schools in their local communities to
explore orchestral repertoire through hands-on music instruction and
interactive experience. Through Link Up, participating music teachers in the
Marysville School District instruct 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> grade
students to play recorders using curriculum developed and provided by Carnegie
Hall. This introduces students to masterworks and teaches them how to read,
recite and perform orchestral music in an environment which encourages the
celebration of the arts as an integral component of our everyday lives. </p>
<p>The culmination of Link Up comes
with the live concert, at which students accompany a professional orchestra
performing the pieces they have learned in school. Just imagine the sound and
excitement of some of the region's best musicians performing with a 1,000
student recorder section. Additional opportunities to explore our community's music vendors and services are made available after the performance. This year's performance will be held at 6:30 p.m. on
May 22, 2014 at Marysville Pilchuck High School Gymnasium. </p>
<p>Last
year, more than 1,300 students participated in Link Up in classrooms across
Snohomish County and the assessment of the program showed student participants
to be highly engaged, well prepared, and excited to perform. </p>
<p><b>What Link Up does for our children:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Introduces them to orchestral ensembles.</li>
<li>Shows them how practice and perseverance leads to
     improvement.</li>
<li>Gives them an opportunity to experience teamwork.</li>
<li>Helps them express themselves creatively.</li>
<li>Makes them feel a part of a professional orchestra.</li>
</ul><p><b>What people are saying about Link Up:</b></p>
<p><i>School
Administrator: Link Up “greatly enlivened our elementary music program. Link-Up
and SCMP brought together our elementary music teachers, a dedicated group, for
professional development in a recorder curriculum. The Project enhanced the
collegiality and esprit de corps of the music teachers, who were enthused to
collaborate with SCMP to bring these opportunities to 1,300 district students.”
</i></p>
<p><i>Music
Teacher: “To have our community provide this program is incredible. When school
music programs are being reduced or even eliminated this sends a clear signal that
the community values music programs. This will help a lot when we have to
justify our programs to keep funding. I think this is one of the best music
programs I have seen in my career.” </i></p>
<p><i>Parent:
“I’ve never seen a live orchestra before. I think I would like to go to a
concert again.” “My son was really into this. He practiced at home a lot and
was really excited to play with the orchestra.” </i></p>
<p><i>Students:
“It was really cool playing with the orchestra.” “I want to learn to play
violin.” “I love music.” “ </i></p>
<p><i>Conductor:

<h3><b>Why
It’s Important</b></h3>
<p>In 2010, Northwestern University
scientists produced a compilation of research findings from scientists all over
the world. The bottom line to these studies was that musical training has a
profound impact on other skills including speech and language, memory and
attention, and even the ability to convey emotions vocally. </p>
<p>The Northwestern researchers
concluded their findings with the following: ""The effect of music training
suggests that, akin to physical exercise and its impact on body fitness, music
is a resource that tones the brain for auditory fitness and thus
requires society to re-examine the role of music in shaping individual
development. “</p>
<p>Other studies have suggested that
music education programs help children develop  self-confidence /
self-esteem, ethical and aesthetic values, discipline, organization and time
coordination, spirit of solidarity and fraternity, awakening of sensibility,
value of teaching others, empathy, personality, leadership, learning
principles, sense of commitment, responsibility, generosity, dedication to
others, sense of individual contribution to collective goals, a noble identity,
intellectually, perseverance, punctuality, creativity, ethic of self and
community improvement, goal setting, and hand/eye/ear coordination. </p>
<p>It is imperative that we continue
the generation-old tradition of teaching music to our young people. The time is
NOW to help raise awareness about the importance of music education! Please
help us ensure that our community's youngest citizens continue to receive this vital part of their cultivation.</p>

<br/><p></p></div>","Who We Are
Snohomish County Music Project
engages a network of passionate musicians to promote artistic citizenship
within our community, expand access to music education in our schools, and use
the power of music therapy to improve the lives of our most vulnerable community
members - at risk youth, veterans and senior citizens. We have proudly reinvented ourselves by using music as a force
for positive changes within our community. Our intention is to create an
environment for musical expression while highlighting urgent needs and providing
grassroots solutions to community problems. 
Music fosters individuality,
creativity, and a deep sense of fulfillment in young people and, as such,
should be an essential part of our educations system. Yet budget cuts continue
to reduce the availability of music education in our schools thus denying
students a holistic educational experience and access to important platforms
for creativity and self-expression. Expanding access to music education in our
schools has never been more important. 
How we are doing it:

Building demand for music programs among children and
     families.
Building support for music programs among community
     leaders.
Building capacity to help schools increase music
     programs.
What is Link Up
Link Up is a program provided in
partnership with the famed Carnegie Hall, which pairs orchestras across the
country with elementary students at schools in their local communities to
explore orchestral repertoire through hands-on music instruction and
interactive experience. Through Link Up, participating music teachers in the
Marysville School District instruct 4th and 5th grade
students to play recorders using curriculum developed and provided by Carnegie
Hall. This introduces students to masterworks and teaches them how to read,
recite and perform orchestral music in an environment which encourages the
celebration of the arts as an integral component of our everyday lives. 
The culmination of Link Up comes
with the live concert, at which students accompany a professional orchestra
performing the pieces they have learned in school. Just imagine the sound and
excitement of some of the region's best musicians performing with a 1,000
student recorder section. Additional opportunities to explore our community's music vendors and services are made available after the performance. This year's performance will be held at 6:30 p.m. on
May 22, 2014 at Marysville Pilchuck High School Gymnasium. 
Last
year, more than 1,300 students participated in Link Up in classrooms across
Snohomish County and the assessment of the program showed student participants
to be highly engaged, well prepared, and excited to perform. 
What Link Up does for our children:

Introduces them to orchestral ensembles.
Shows them how practice and perseverance leads to
     improvement.
Gives them an opportunity to experience teamwork.
Helps them express themselves creatively.
Makes them feel a part of a professional orchestra.
What people are saying about Link Up:
School
Administrator: Link Up “greatly enlivened our elementary music program. Link-Up
and SCMP brought together our elementary music teachers, a dedicated group, for
professional development in a recorder curriculum. The Project enhanced the
collegiality and esprit de corps of the music teachers, who were enthused to
collaborate with SCMP to bring these opportunities to 1,300 district students.”

Music
Teacher: “To have our community provide this program is incredible. When school
music programs are being reduced or even eliminated this sends a clear signal that
the community values music programs. This will help a lot when we have to
justify our programs to keep funding. I think this is one of the best music
programs I have seen in my career.” 
Parent:
“I’ve never seen a live orchestra before. I think I would like to go to a
concert again.” “My son was really into this. He practiced at home a lot and
was really excited to play with the orchestra.” 
Students:
“It was really cool playing with the orchestra.” “I want to learn to play
violin.” “I love music.” “ 
Conductor:
“The program provided a unique and powerful musical experience for fourth and
fifth graders in the Marysville school district. Students were very proud to be
playing along with a full symphony orchestra and left the concert excited for
next year’s Link Up. At the conclusion of the concert, I asked the students if
they wanted to keep playing music in middle school. Every student responded
with an enthusiastic ""Yes!"" Link Up is an amazing opportunity for
students and helps build strong musicians and music lovers in the world. I'm
very happy to be a part of a project that creates such a buzz of excitement around
music and art of various genres and styles.” Why We Need Your HelpAs a non-profit community arts
program, our budget is contingent on the support of others. To keep Link Up in
our schools and sustain its presence in the community, we ask for support to
cover the costs of program staff, instruments, and the culminating interactive
concert with a professional orchestra.
We know that not everyone is able to contribute funds to our
campaign, and we equally appreciate any efforts you make to help us get the
word out. Please share our campaign link in support of our project to help us

<p><br/>Hello and thank you for coming to my page!!!!</p>
<p>I am graduating with my BS in Biology from University of Houston this December, and after developing a passion for evolutionary biology research I have decided to go on to puruse a PhD in evolutionary biology!  I've already secured letters of recommendation, aced the GRE, gotten tons of relevant research experience and am on my way to potentially getting a publication (squeal!), but there is one absolutely vital component missing:  I don't have the money to pay for my application fees.  It costs about $100 for each program I apply to, and I ideally need to apply to at least 5 if possible to have a good chance of making it in somewhere.  More would be amazing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, though, almost all of the programs have a deadline of December 1st for all application materials, including fees.  This date has snuck up on me BAD, so now I have to scramble... which is where you lovely, beautiful, incredibly good-looking and generous human beings come in.  Indie Go Go has a bit of a lag time between when your campaign ends and your money comes in, so I've got until NOVEMBER 19TH to get all the donations I can.</p>
<p>I know many of you are in financial situations just as bad as mine (or maybe worse), so if you can't donate anything, please feel free to share this with as many people as your heart desires.  If you can donate a dollar, I would love a dollar.  If you can donate more dollars, I love more dollars.</p>
<p>Please, oh please, help me pay for grad school applications. I will love you forever, in addition to some cool prizes (although they may not be delivered until after finals):</p>
<p>$10 donation level: I will make you a manipulated photo or MS Paint style image of adorably poor quality using your choice of subject(s). Like this: <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/hig4I.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>or this: <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imgur.com/Vnyr8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>$20 donation level: I will do an image like the one bove, but in the form of an animated .gif! How fun is that? Hopefully at least slightly fun.</p>
<p>$50 donation level: I will make you a small-ish crafty thing of your choice. Although that's super vague, we'll talk it out and it'll get done. Pretty much something that will take less than 3 hours of labor. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10101572731171004.3455764.8331889&amp;type=1&amp;l=34c92eb97a"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Here's some of my crochet work, for example</a>.</p>
<p>$100 donation level: I will first freak out in gratitude, and then I will make you a much bigger and more impressive thing than I would at the $50 level.

If I don't get a single penny more, I'll be happy as a clam.  However, if you feel like donating to my cause is waaay up on your priorities list, here is what I might end up using the unexpected excess of funding for:

Maybe applying for yet more schools if I get some good correspondence going with potential faculty.
Replacing the extremely bald tire on my car.
Getting more contact lenses since I'm almost out and have very little money right now.
Buying glasses for my boyfriend so he stops getting headaches.
Building up a safety net in case I don't get a new job before I lose mine in December (which is definitely happening).
I just want to make sure that anyone who donates from here on out is aware of what their generosity is going toward.  I am enormously humbled and amazed by the people I have in my life, and I absolutely don't know what I would do without all of you.  Also, you can all consider this as Christmabirthdaygraduation stuff.  You've done more than I could ever, ever want.(I dont' think this .gif is always working... so if not, go here to get the point)

<p>That’s why we created Camp Unity Eastside.  We’re a collection of<br/>like-minded individuals who came together with the common goal of<br/>empowering the homeless.  We had a vision of creating an environment<br/>condusive to the safety and wellbeing of those who need it the most. <br/> We created a place where the disenfranchised can get everything from<br/>resume help and career advice to counseling and dental care.  We<br/>created a home, a community, and a family.</p>
<p><br/>Camp Unity Eastside was born on November 15, 2012 at Lake Washington<br/>United Methodist Church in Kirkland, Washington as a not for profit<br/>privately owned and self-managed organization.  <span>We<br/>are a temporary shelter which moves every few months from city to<br/>city on the east side of Lake Washington in the greater Seattle area.</span></p>
<p><br/><span>LWUMC greeted us with open arms, and we found that besides hospitality,<br/>true friendship was waiting for us.  Pastor Kelly Dalman-Oeth and his<br/>congregation of angels, along with Sandi and Randy Hunt, were beyond<br/>instrumental in helping us get up and running.  We made our first<br/>official move as a camp on March 9</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span><br/>to the Trinity Lutheran Church in Kirkland.</span></p>
<p><br/><span>The transition was smooth, and our stay with TLC has been nothing short<br/>of a blessing.  Time moves quickly, as always, and our visit here is<br/>almost at an end.  We are scheduled to move again on September 14</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span>,<br/>and our next host will be First United Methodist Church in Bellevue, WA.  </span><br/></p>
<p><span>The goal of our campaign is funding the day to day operations of the<br/>camp.  Per our agreements with our host cities and our commitment to<br/>our residents, we provide services and amenities that can range from<br/>kitchen facilities and blankets to transportation and waste removal,<br/>and everything in-between.  Our current operating budget stands at<br/>almost $5000 per month, but the more we raise, the more services we<br/>can provide.  CUE is a recognized nonprofit in the state of Washington                    and a 501c3 charity.</span></p>
<p><span></span> </p>
<p><span>It’s easy to hand a couple of bucks to a guy standing by the road holding<br/>a sign, and you hope you’re making a difference.  Your gift of<br/>support to our campaign is just as easy and will go a long way to<br/>ensure that fewer people will be forced to put themselves in that<br/>position.  With your help, Camp Unity Eastside will continue its<br/>ongoing effort to provide shelter, safety, and hope to all those in<br/>need.  Please join us in making a difference in their lives and<br/>making our world a better place to call home.</span></p>

 Hacking Base (fhb) is an open group of hackers and food&amp;beverage 
enthusiast from all over the world who share the love of experimenting 
with food and beverages. We have promoted these concepts on some of the 
major hacker events in the last years and recently we started our 
website becoming permanently active. We are into building tools and 
coming up with new technologies often based on ancient wisdom of 
traditional societies merging our ancestors knowledge with today's 
scientific understanding and technology. Having a good time enjoying 
excellent food and drinks are important to us too :-)</p>At our projects you can come to hack food with us just joining or giving one of our 
donation based workshops, present and chat about some cool idea, cook your favorite dish, just 
have your pick. We build and run facilities which are supporting these activities 
like experimental kitchen, workshop venue, bio corner, washing area etc. We are 
documenting what we do sharing that with the community as our 
contribution to the open source paradigm with the hope of changing the 
world for the better and enjoying it on the way!<br/><br/><p>If
 you want to get rough idea what we plan to do at 30c3, please check the 
section --This project, bullet points--, for more detail information how
 we are going to run the base at the <a href=""http://events.ccc.de/category/30c3/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">30c3</a> and use the money from this campaign please check --The Base in

 Hacking Base (fhb) is an open group of hackers and food&beverage 
enthusiast from all over the world who share the love of experimenting 
with food and beverages. We have promoted these concepts on some of the 
major hacker events in the last years and recently we started our 
website becoming permanently active. We are into building tools and 
coming up with new technologies often based on ancient wisdom of 
traditional societies merging our ancestors knowledge with today's 
scientific understanding and technology. Having a good time enjoying 
excellent food and drinks are important to us too :-)At our projects you can come to hack food with us just joining or giving one of our 
donation based workshops, present and chat about some cool idea, cook your favorite dish, just 
have your pick. We build and run facilities which are supporting these activities 
like experimental kitchen, workshop venue, bio corner, washing area etc. We are 
documenting what we do sharing that with the community as our 
contribution to the open source paradigm with the hope of changing the 
world for the better and enjoying it on the way!If
 you want to get rough idea what we plan to do at 30c3, please check the 
section --This project, bullet points--, for more detail information how
 we are going to run the base at the 30c3 and use the money from this campaign please check --The Base in

<p>Making art a vehicle

against an environment of Israeli colonial occupation and violence.</p>
<p><b></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/243724/files/20131205063901-workshop_13.jpg?1386254341"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Program
Overview </b></p>
<p>Since 2007 the AIC
has been working with communities in the West Bank's Hebron region under the
title Art is Resistance. With this program the AIC promotes change by enhancing
social, political and cultural voices of Palestinian women, visioning and
voicing ideas that create a future free of Israeli colonial occupation and
violence.</p>
<p>The program trains 40
young women from the Hebron area yearly, helping them to develop artistic
capacities while sharing perspectives on beauty, art and personal expression.
Through the weekly, half-day program, participants are given tools of
expression to help them cope with the violent reality of their surroundings,
while strengthening their creativity and artistic senses, building confidence
in their abilities and helping them produce their own art. Twice yearly art
exhibitions in Hebron are an integral part of the program, providing
participants the opportunity to publicly share their art with the wider
community.</p>
<p><b>Why Art?</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/243727/files/20131205063949-workshop_10.jpg?1386254389"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Art, as a language,

<p>The occupied West Bank city of Hebron is a microcosm of the Israeli
occupation, with settlements both surrounding and in the heart of the city; the
Separation Wall choking residents from the east and north; massive Israeli military
presence, land confiscations and daily violations of human and national rights.The
devastation wrought by years of Israeli occupation, clashes and tensions has
led to structural socio-economic and political instability, with an extremely
negative impact on Palestinian culture and identity.</p>
<p>Opportunities are extremely limited in Hebron. The Hebron district suffers
from the highest rates of unemployment and poverty in the West Bank, with women
bearing the brunt of these hardships. This area is also one of the most socially
conservative, and accepted opportunities for women to acquire cultural tools
such as painting and drawing are almost non-existent. </p>

<p>Renowned Palestinian
artist Yousef Katalo studied art during his seven years in Israeli prison, and
continued to create art when later imprisoned by the Palestinian Authority.  Katalo says that when empowering participants
in the art workshop, ""my aim is to make the students
identify themselves and find ways to express all the different feelings arising

Making art a vehicle
of transformation to empower young Palestinian women’s social and political resistance
against an environment of Israeli colonial occupation and violence.
Program
Overview 
Since 2007 the AIC
has been working with communities in the West Bank's Hebron region under the
title Art is Resistance. With this program the AIC promotes change by enhancing
social, political and cultural voices of Palestinian women, visioning and
voicing ideas that create a future free of Israeli colonial occupation and
violence.
The program trains 40
young women from the Hebron area yearly, helping them to develop artistic
capacities while sharing perspectives on beauty, art and personal expression.
Through the weekly, half-day program, participants are given tools of
expression to help them cope with the violent reality of their surroundings,
while strengthening their creativity and artistic senses, building confidence
in their abilities and helping them produce their own art. Twice yearly art
exhibitions in Hebron are an integral part of the program, providing
participants the opportunity to publicly share their art with the wider
community.
Why Art?Art, as a language,
empowers the participating women across cultural, economic and social barriers to
voice realities of a life under the double oppression of colonial occupation
and patriarchy. While emphasizing independence, art makes collaboration a tool
to transform aspirations into reality, translating personal strengths into critical
and creative thinking. Problem 
The occupied West Bank city of Hebron is a microcosm of the Israeli
occupation, with settlements both surrounding and in the heart of the city; the
Separation Wall choking residents from the east and north; massive Israeli military
presence, land confiscations and daily violations of human and national rights.The
devastation wrought by years of Israeli occupation, clashes and tensions has
led to structural socio-economic and political instability, with an extremely
negative impact on Palestinian culture and identity.
Opportunities are extremely limited in Hebron. The Hebron district suffers
from the highest rates of unemployment and poverty in the West Bank, with women
bearing the brunt of these hardships. This area is also one of the most socially
conservative, and accepted opportunities for women to acquire cultural tools
such as painting and drawing are almost non-existent. 
The Participants 
The participants are Palestinian girl children and women, aged 16 and
above, who come primarily from the villages surrounding the city of Hebron.
Many of the women don't work outside the home and their economic situations are
difficult. For all participants, the art is resistance training opens a window
onto their interior and exterior worlds, a life-changing window that would
otherwise not be opened.The Art Trainer
Renowned Palestinian
artist Yousef Katalo studied art during his seven years in Israeli prison, and
continued to create art when later imprisoned by the Palestinian Authority.  Katalo says that when empowering participants
in the art workshop, ""my aim is to make the students
identify themselves and find ways to express all the different feelings arising
from the Palestinian situation."" Katalo adds that his art is ""on the
side of the weak, the poor, the oppressed. With my paintings I want to send a
message that can create political and social awareness.""The Opportunity By invigorating
participant’s personal strengths in meaningful ways the program provide them
with new routes of participation in the resistance to colonial occupation as
subjects of change. Participants are not passively waiting for a future beyond
the realm of occupation and patriarchy, but helping to forge such a future.  Our Current

Description
In cooperation with In Terris Foundation, TECHO Ecuador seeks to install
ecological sanitary facilities for 100 families who live in unreasonable
living conditions in the most excluded regions of Ecuador. These sanitary
facilities work without the usage of
water and electricity. Additionally, they produce fertilizer for the agriculture.What is the issue, problem or challenge?
2.5 billion people in the world live without access to sanitary
facilities. In Ecuador, there are 3 million people that have never had access to
adequate sanitation facilities. Communities
without proper sanitation facilities create critical health hazards such as the
contamination of fresh water reservoirs. In addition, communities are exposed
to diseases that are transmitted by poor hygiene, resulting in gastroduodenal disorder which is the 3rd largest cause of death in the world. What does the ecological sanitary facilities look like?
The ecological sanitary facilities are
decentralized, in other words, they do not depend on a drainage system or water
in general. The unit is installed to be used mechanically. 
Feces are mixed with sawdust in order to not only ensure hygiene, but to
create fertilizer that is used to grow crops. Where and when?
The project will take place in Manabí, Guayas,
Azuay, and Pichincha benefiting 100 families which equals 500 people. The installation will begin on April 2014.Sustainability
of the project:
Beginning on May
2014, TECHO Ecuador plans to evaluate the functionality of the unit and its
ecological and hygienic effects through surveys in the communities and
post-construction activities. 
The most
important objective is to improve the living conditions of these families
living in the most excluded slums. In January of 2015, the project will be finished
with a detailed report. 
These ecological sanitary facilities have been in used in Guayaquil, Ecuador
where they have experienced great success. These units not only improve the
living conditions of families and their communities, but they also benefit the environment.
Together we can make a change.

We want everyone to be able to participate, and we want to be able to give some money to the trainers and organizers who are putting this event together. This is the reason we are creating this campaign: without it, we are not confident we can cover our costs, let alone give some money to the trainers and organizers whose livelihood is tied up with this kind of work. Whether or not you can be there, we hope you will be inspired by what we are trying to do, that you will choose to contribute from your heart to make this training a success, so that it becomes sustainable for Israeli-Jewish and Palestinian leaders and activists to be together as peers and partners to develop our skills, self-awareness, and ability to contribute to the organizations, movements, and communities which they serve.What you get is the satisfaction of contributing to the ongoing efforts to bring vision and hope to the region, the possibility of attending the event, and a report we plan on writing after the event, so you know what your contribution supported. In addition, depending on the amount of your contribution, you can get additional gifts – see the sidebar for more information.Who We AreMiki Kashtan is certified NVC trainer, is a founder of Bay Area Nonviolent Communication and the North America Leadership Program. She is inspired by the role of visionary leadership in shaping a livable future, and works toward that vision by sharing the principles and practices of Nonviolent Communication through mediation, meeting facilitation, consulting, and training for organizations and for committed individuals. Miki blogs at the Fearless Heart. Her articles have appeared in Tikkun magazine, Waging Nonviolence, Shareable, and elsewhere. Her first book, Spinning Threads of Radical Aliveness: Transcending the Legacy of Separation in Our Individual Lives is due out in early 2014. She holds a Ph.D. in Sociology from UC Berkeley.Roberta Wall is a lawyer, mediator, trainer, parent, activist, mindfulness practitioner and coach.  She shares her time between Israel and the beautiful Hudson River Valley of Upstate New York and travels the world coaching couples, individuals and organizations and facilitating workshops and retreats inspired by Nonviolent Communication (NVC) as developed by Dr. Marshall Rosenberg and Buddhist teachers Thich Nhat Hanh and the Dalai Lama, and teachers and rabbis from her root Jewish tradition. Sami Awad is is the Executive Director of Holy Land Trust. At a young age, Sami was influenced by the teaching of his uncle Mubarak Awad, the Palestinian activist who promoted nonviolent resistance to the occupation during the first Intifadah (popular uprising) and was arrested and deported for his peaceful / nonviolent activists by the Israeli government. Through working with Mubarak, Sami was introduced to great leaders and visionaries of the global nonviolence movement; from Jesus to Gandhi to King. Sami Awad holds a Masters Degree in International Relations from the American University in Washington D.C. and an undergraduate degree in Political Science from the University of Kansas.Since his return and establishment of HLT, Sami has engaged himself locally, through promoting and engaging in nonviolence, healing and transformation work and globally through visiting and speaking in different countries, communities, political and religious organizations in places such as India, South Africa, numerous European countries, and the US.Other Ways You Can HelpPlease spread the word! Think of people you know who are longing to see positive action in support of transformation in the region, people who want to value the lives of everyone in this tortured piece of land. Tell them about the opportunity to participate - both as learners at the event, and as partners and co-sponsors in making this possible. Speak about this at your synagogue, church, or mosque, share it on your Facebook page and elsewhere.Thank you already for your heart and support. Remember, in these kinds of campaigns, no amount is too large or too small.-Miki, Roberta, Sami and the many others who support this work.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1><b>Tuition Fee for human trafficking and sex slavery victim Bekunda Sunday</b></h1>
<br/><i>(If you would like with use <b>other payment methods than PayPal or credit card</b>, or if you have <b>any questions</b>, please contact: </i>tuitionfee.for.bekundasunday@gmail.com<i>.</i>)<br/><br/><i>(<b>Dear companies</b>, if you would like to <b>sponsor this campaign</b> and wish for further cooperation, please contact: </i>tuitionfee.for.bekundasunday@gmail.com<i>.)</i><br/><br/><h3>About me and the idea<br/>
</h3>
<p>My name is Valerio Montanari. I am a 20-year-old student in Germany and I read about Bekunda Sunday's history on RNW.org. He is a victim of human trafficking and sex slavery and needs money to pay his tuition fees. I was able to contact him personally by giving my contact information to RNW which forwarded it to Bekunda Sunday.<br/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>About Bekunda Sunday</h3>
<p>Bekunda Sunday is a 26-year-old student at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. He is aiming for a Bachelor's Degree in Tourism. Less then 0.2% of the total Ugandan population is in higher education at the moment (in Germany it's almost 4%, in the US around 5,5%). This means he is offered a big chance.<br/></p>
<p>When he was looking for a job to pay his tuition fees, he met a gentleman named Charles in early January 2013. He offered him a job and seemed to be very nice and friendly, so Bekunda went with him and other students to Kenya. In Kenya he and the other victims were forced to give away their IDs and were threatened with death. To brake the victims' spirit, Charles and his accomplices killed a victim who tried to escape and made the whole group watch. <br/></p>
<p>Bekunda and the other victims were forced to have sexual intercourse, with boys and girls, in front of cameras, and were given alcohol and intravenous drugs. They were constantly mistreated, beaten up, threatened with death and also forced to prostitute themselves. Every day Bekunda was forced to have intercourse with 5 to 10 people, catching all major venereal diseases and suffering from the pain caused by the medication they gave him to keep him going.<br/></p>
<h4>The escape</h4>
<p>After being held the whole January and February, Bekunda was able to escape in early March 2013 when a man from the UK contacted Charles. He wanted him to send Bekunda to the UK so that he could have his private love partner. Because Bekunda does not speak Swaheli it would not have been believable to fake a Kenyan passport, so they had to go back to Uganda to get the original passport. On the way to Uganda Bekunda was able to escape.</p>
<h4>Living with the trauma<br/>
</h4>
<p>He reported the case to the police but since Charles is a powerful man, nothing was done to him. After living on the street for a while and three months of medical and psycho-social therapy Bekunda reported the case to the newspapers. He has been receiving threats by human traffickers ever since. Two weeks after his mother had read about his ordeal in the newspaper, she passed away.</p>
<p>Bekunda insisted that his name should be in the newspapers because he did not want to hide anymore. He wants to warn young people about human traffickers and hopes he can be of help one day.<br/></p>
<p>I contacted Mnason Tweheyo, Professor and Dean at Makerere University, who has confirmed that this story is real.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>The Project: Help for Bekunda Sunday</h3>
<p>Even though the University has allowed him to finish his studies, he still needs to pay tuition fees. Since Uganda is a country with an extremely high youth unemployment rate (62% according to theguardian.com and 83% according to the African Development Bank) he was not able to find a job. </p>
<p>This is what this campaign is taking care of. </p>

Thousands of women visit the site every month to seek the career guidance they need. </p><p>Over these past four years, I have also conducted global research and written the first career advice book for women in emerging markets. </p><p>The book, set for an early 2015 release, is titled <b><i>Undeterred: The Six Success Habits of Women in Emerging Economies</i></b>.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/943534/files/20141019195642-UNDETERRED_final_book_cover.png?1413773802"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Most of you have been with me on this long journey to realize my lifelong professional dream: <i>thank you for all of your encouragement, guidance and support!</i></p>
<p><b>TWO WAYS YOU CAN HELP ME LAUNCH THE BOOK</b></p>
<p>If unleashing the success of women around the world moves you, here are two things you can do TODAY:</p>
<p></p><ol>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Help spread the word!</b> Share this project with one person you know who is also passionate about seeing women succeed. </span><br/>
</li>
</ol><p>We have 17 days to make this campaign a success! </p><p>I am confident that together we can get this important book into the hands of aspiring young women around the world who need inspiration and actionable advice to succeed in their careers and businesses.</p>
<p>You and I have the power to use our voices and financial resources for good - and in this case, to make a difference in the lives of so many others.</p>
<p><i>Will you help me accelerate the success of 100,000 women around the world?</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>WHY?</b></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>THERE'S A GAP.</b> There’s a gap between the knowledge women gain through their university education and the workplace skills they need to succeed at work. </li>
<li>
<b>THERE'S A NEED.</b> Women in emerging economies regularly tell me that they don’t have access to non-western, culturally relevant career guidance to help them close that gap.</li>
<li>

FULFILLING MY LIFELONG DREAM: WRITING THIS BOOK
The past 20 years of my life have been dedicated to helping women advance in their careers and businesses.

Four years ago, I founded TheWayWomenWork.com, a career advice platform for women in emerging economies. Thousands of women visit the site every month to seek the career guidance they need. Over these past four years, I have also conducted global research and written the first career advice book for women in emerging markets. The book, set for an early 2015 release, is titled Undeterred: The Six Success Habits of Women in Emerging Economies.Most of you have been with me on this long journey to realize my lifelong professional dream: thank you for all of your encouragement, guidance and support!
TWO WAYS YOU CAN HELP ME LAUNCH THE BOOK
If unleashing the success of women around the world moves you, here are two things you can do TODAY:


Back this campaign now! Donate to help a young women launch their careers or businesses. Below is an example of the type of woman you will be helping. 


Help spread the word! Share this project with one person you know who is also passionate about seeing women succeed. 

We have 17 days to make this campaign a success! I am confident that together we can get this important book into the hands of aspiring young women around the world who need inspiration and actionable advice to succeed in their careers and businesses.
You and I have the power to use our voices and financial resources for good - and in this case, to make a difference in the lives of so many others.
Will you help me accelerate the success of 100,000 women around the world?

WHY?


THERE'S A GAP. There’s a gap between the knowledge women gain through their university education and the workplace skills they need to succeed at work. 

THERE'S A NEED. Women in emerging economies regularly tell me that they don’t have access to non-western, culturally relevant career guidance to help them close that gap.

THE FUTURE WORKFORCE. Businesses around the world are increasingly dependent on the skills and work of highly-educated women in emerging economies. As women graduate from universities at higher rates than men, companies have to figure out how to bring them into the workforce. The future of these companies and the global economy is dependent on women succeeding at work.

ENOUGH NEGATIVITY. I’ve grown weary of hearing the media and others talk almost exclusively about the obstacles women in developing and emerging economies face. While much of it is true, the fact of the matter is that there are also MILLIONS of women that we never hear about who are succeeding (see thewaywomenwork.com). I want to share women’s progress, not their plight!

I'm Maria. As a social worker in Boston working with low-income and homeless women, I saw how poverty disproportionately affects ethnic, racial, and linguistic minorities. Women face further barriers to achieving economic self-sufficiency, particularly if they have children. However, there is a highly sought-after skill that is abundant in low-income communities: Language.
Careers for bilingual people, such as medical interpreting, are growing at a much faster rate than other professions. 

42.2% employment opportunity growth by 2020 
The median salary for a medical interpreter is $43,380 (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics)
 The answer seems simple, right? However, getting the education to become a medical interpreter is nearly impossible for qualified women who can't afford tuition, lack transportation or childcare, and have no connections in the field. 
That's why I founded Found in Translation. We provide free Medical Interpreter Training to low-income and homeless bilingual women, along with wrap-around services, mentoring, and job skills coaching, to make them more likely to succeed even if they are single mothers, or living in a shelter, or lack the community supports that most successful professionals have. Over half of our students live below the federal poverty line ($15,510 for a single mother with one child).

But we could do so much more with our own space!
 Here's what we offer now:

We provide one 12-week Medical Interpreting Certificate Course to about 30 women per year, as well as job and internship placement support to our alumnae.
Here's what we could offer with our own classroom and office space:

Multiple Certificate Courses, on different topics, serving up to 120 women per year.
Workshops for medical employees, serving up to 300 people per year.
An Interpreter Resource Center for students and alumnae to receive ongoing instruction, guidance, and collegial support. In 3 years, that will serve over 230 alumnae
On-site job placement service, creating a direct pipeline for our grads into Boston's medical agencies. In 3 years, this employment will have lifted 230 families out of poverty, including about 400 children.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Dale Fotsch met a guy, they lived together, they split up. He sued her for part of her property and she fought him in court, like you are supposed to do. It took nine years, but she finally got an outcome.</p>
<p>During the process, she signed a $100000 re-mortgage on the property she was fighting for, which her lawyer agreed to take as security, because the bill was getting too high.</p>
<p>Well, she won, and the courts ordered her ex to pay her court costs, but he went bankrupt, so she was on the hook for the $90000, give or take.</p>
<p>By the time this happened, the 18% interest had taken it's toll, and the bill has ballooned to $180000, and her lawyer is going to forclose on her to get payment for his years of work.</p>
<p>This isn't a question of who is right or wrong, but to try and help someone who truly needs it. The CBC link at the bottom will fill you in more on the details of the story, if you have any doubts.</p>
<p>As for me, my name is Chris Bird, and I'm a former trucker, and wannabe blogger. I hadn't even heard of this, or Ms. Fotsch until the day I started this campaign.</p>
<p>The thing is, I hate to see good people get the shaft, and while this lawyer is going to get his fee no matter what, I would really hate for this woman to lose her home in order for that to happen.</p>
<p>I think that if we could get 40000 people to kick in $5 a piece, we could drastically improve this woman's life, and it really isn't going to change ours at all. I'm sure that if you watch the video and read the article that you'll find below, you will see what kind of emotional torment this woman is going through. She's not shirking her responsibility. She's not crying foul. She is just looking for some sort of deal where she can keep her home that she's worked hard for all of her life.</p>
<p>I was raised by a single mother, and when I think about what it would have been like if this happened to her, it brings tears to my eyes. We have everything we need, and there are people who are losing everything they have. We (my family) have suspended gift giving for our extended families in order to give to people who have less, at the time of year when charity means the most, and we hope that you could find it in your heart to help too. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I'd like to raise enough for her to be able to keep her home, but if we can't do that, then at least give her a leg up in whatever her next step is. What you get is a knowledge that you truly helped someone, with no expectation of getting something in return. You did it just because you could, and you would hope someone would help if it was you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I can't say for sure, but I'm sure the impact is huge. If you could save a person's mental health, family life, or reason to get up in the morning. Wouldn't that be about the biggest thing in the world?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand if you can't help out financially, but maybe you could tell your real friends about it, share it with your pretend friends on Facebook, Google+, or Twitter, or tack up a homemade sign at your grocery store. Anything you can do to get the word out will mean a lot to this woman. If you tell 100 people about it, and 1 person gives $5, then you've done a great thing. If ten of them share it with 100 people and they get the same result, that's getting exponentially huge fast. Every little bit helps, and that's the plain truth.</p>

We’ve worked in the public eye, visible and accessible to anyone and everyone who has an interest in meditation. So far, it’s been a wonderful and exciting ride! </p><p><strong>We’re asking for your help so we can reach even more people and continue to share meditation with anyone who wants to learn.</strong></p><p>Dharma Center began in 1998 with just two Buddhist monks of the Rama lineage who had a passion to teach meditation. Since then, we’ve had dozens of different teachers and thousands of students pass through our door. As a volunteer organization, we’ve survived on a shoe-string budget, always reinvesting every dime we’ve every collected. Now we want to do something BIG!</p><p>Dharma Center is planning the largest event and fundraiser we’ve ever attempted, and we want you to be a part of it. Dharma Center’s 16th anniversary will be on the fall equinox this year. However, we wish to celebrate not only Dharma Center and all the people who have made our little meditation hall possible, but also our roots in the Rama Tribe. Therefore, we’ve planned the event to coincide with the 2015 Rama birthday celebration. </p><p>The Sweet 16 Unity Celebration will take place the weekend of February 7, 2015. The main event will be an exquisite evening of practitioners with roots in the Rama lineage sharing the Path. We’ll also have an open house during the day so everyone can experience meditation at Dharma Center, as well as a couple of optional events on Sunday.</p><p>To help us plan, we’re asking everyone to answer our short, confidential survey. Please be sure to include your contact information on each question where asked if you want to hear from us. Here’s the link to the survey: <a href=""http://www.surveyact.com/s/5eseak73B1EfPmPK"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.surveyact.com/s/5eseak73B1EfPmPK</a></p><p>In addition to collecting donations for our marketing efforts, we’re selling tickets to the big celebration. We’ve booked an event room at the Sheraton Bay Tower on Harbor Island in San Diego, and look forward to celebrating with you! </p><p>We hope you’ll also become a Dharma Center member so we can invite you to our many member-only events. Your membership will become effective immediately upon donation. If you're already a member, your membership will be extended. </p><p>At Dharma Center, we delight in the diversity and variety of the Rama lineage. We see this diversity as a great strength, as we can help guide many different types of people, and as a great opportunity for tribe members to learn from one another and move forward on the spiritual path. Dharma Center operates as a<br/>collaborative teaching model, where each teacher is respected as a unique spiritual warrior who shares the knowledge she has earned along her own path.</p><p>It is in this spirit of collaboration that we invite you and your students and friends to be a part of the Sweet 16 Unity Fundraiser Celebration. </p><p>It is with sincere gratitude all of us at Dharma Center thank you for your support!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/545468/files/20140430114835-5DCTeachers.jpg?1398883715"" src="""" style=""width: 438.73px; height: 291px;""/></p><p>We currently have 6 volunteer teachers offering meditation classes at Dharma Center.

We’ve worked in the public eye, visible and accessible to anyone and everyone who has an interest in meditation. So far, it’s been a wonderful and exciting ride! We’re asking for your help so we can reach even more people and continue to share meditation with anyone who wants to learn.Dharma Center began in 1998 with just two Buddhist monks of the Rama lineage who had a passion to teach meditation. Since then, we’ve had dozens of different teachers and thousands of students pass through our door. As a volunteer organization, we’ve survived on a shoe-string budget, always reinvesting every dime we’ve every collected. Now we want to do something BIG!Dharma Center is planning the largest event and fundraiser we’ve ever attempted, and we want you to be a part of it. Dharma Center’s 16th anniversary will be on the fall equinox this year. However, we wish to celebrate not only Dharma Center and all the people who have made our little meditation hall possible, but also our roots in the Rama Tribe. Therefore, we’ve planned the event to coincide with the 2015 Rama birthday celebration. The Sweet 16 Unity Celebration will take place the weekend of February 7, 2015. The main event will be an exquisite evening of practitioners with roots in the Rama lineage sharing the Path. We’ll also have an open house during the day so everyone can experience meditation at Dharma Center, as well as a couple of optional events on Sunday.To help us plan, we’re asking everyone to answer our short, confidential survey. Please be sure to include your contact information on each question where asked if you want to hear from us. Here’s the link to the survey: http://www.surveyact.com/s/5eseak73B1EfPmPKIn addition to collecting donations for our marketing efforts, we’re selling tickets to the big celebration.

Your membership will become effective immediately upon donation. If you're already a member, your membership will be extended. At Dharma Center, we delight in the diversity and variety of the Rama lineage. We see this diversity as a great strength, as we can help guide many different types of people, and as a great opportunity for tribe members to learn from one another and move forward on the spiritual path. Dharma Center operates as acollaborative teaching model, where each teacher is respected as a unique spiritual warrior who shares the knowledge she has earned along her own path.It is in this spirit of collaboration that we invite you and your students and friends to be a part of the Sweet 16 Unity Fundraiser Celebration. It is with sincere gratitude all of us at Dharma Center thank you for your support!We currently have 6 volunteer teachers offering meditation classes at Dharma Center. (Five of us are pictured here.)

     experiment.  We will get the chance to explore and improve
     design ideas using life-size models. Building will becomes an active
     process that reacts directly to the location at hand; the unforeseen
     represents not a nuisance, but rather: potential.  You can find out

Hi,
Brigitta stone-johnson , commonly referred to as ‘brigs’, grew up in
rural kwazulu natal in a farming community near Vryheid, South Africa, between
1982 - 2000. educated at The University of the Witwatersrand, faculty of
architecture and the built environment 2001-2006. Lives in Brixton Johannesburg
from 2010 - present day with her husband Wayne Johnson , she lives with her
husband + her dog Shigeru - a hyperactive poodle. where she gardens, draws ,
designs, photographs and tries to convince everyone she meets to be
kinder, more present and engage in the community around
them and their fellow man. 

The campaign is to help
     raise funds for my travel too and accommodation for the duration of the
     summer school - 21 days in Darmstadt, Germany from 7th-27th of July.
      The summer school will be focusing on Collective building as an
     experiment.  We will get the chance to explore and improve
     design ideas using life-size models. Building will becomes an active
     process that reacts directly to the location at hand; the unforeseen
     represents not a nuisance, but rather: potential.  You can find out
     more about the summer school here. Osthang Project -
     2014

Having worked largely in
     isolation from an academic perspective for the last few years I would love
     the opportunity to work with a larger team of people who are as passionate
     about community spaces as I am. Looking forward I hope to work to a
     greater extent both within my local neighborhood and in my broader
     regional context, Hopefully by means of a business I hope to start, but
     also by any means available to me, be they large or small. 
In helping me achieve this
     small goal, you will be joining me in the first steps toward the future
     goal of starting a business which will work specifically with
     community organisations finding creative solutions to a multitude of
     design problems.What is the Osthang Project ?The Short Version - The Osthang project is a summer school program and Experimental building, workshop - which will be taking place in - Mathildenhöhe - a former artist colony in Darmstadt, Germany. It is a 21 day program from the 7 -27 july this year. It project is hosted by International Music Institute Darmstadt, in conjunction with Raumlaborberlin. Since 2008 the Darmstadt Architecture Summer has used artistic interventions in the public sphere to promote discourse on urban development in Darmstadt, the Rhine-Main metropolitan region and beyond; since 2011 it has done so in conjunction with the cities of Frankfurt, Offenbach and Wiesbaden as the Architecture Summer Rhein-Main (ASRM). The Gernal idea is to expore new idea's around the concept of living together and to deign and build those spaces while exploring experimental ideas, materials etc.

You may also add your own personal message to the post as well.At $50 to $99, I will make a personal video of me singing, reciting, or reading whatever you want me to and post it on YouTube as well as the blog. I've been told I have a good, deep reading voice, as well as being a pretty competent singer. Whether you want me to read Green Eggs and Ham, Sonnet 116, or sing a tune from Taylor Swift, I'll do it as passionately or comedically as you want me to. I might even get all dressed up for the video too. All previous perks included too!From $100-$499, backers can join an hour-long livestream I will hold on a to-be-determined streaming service to discuss the trip, from experiences to funny happenings and everything in between. The thank-you note and public post are also included.Finally, for donations $500 and up, backers will be treated to a lunch with me in Seattle to discuss experiences from the trip and whatever else springs upon us. Other arrangements can be made if you are unable to attend the lunch. Planning and details for the lunch will be cemented in the weeks to come. You will also receive the physical and public thanks. The ImpactInternational opportunities are rare to come by for kids in my situation, especially at this age. Being given this chance to travel to another country to educate other students with the same passion as I do is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.The Business Week program had a profound impact on my life back when I was 15. I really had no idea what I wanted to do when I grew up, especially when ""What do you want to do when you grow up?"" evolved into ""What do you want to do in 4 years?"" I attended the program and it changed me. Not only did I learn about the business, but the connections I made with professionals and students alike kept me going back to the camp year after year. There's a certain environment at the camp that's indescribable. It's happy, fun, inviting: a plethora of good feelings. I hope to give this same experience to other students overseas.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are unable to contribute to my cause, it's totally okay! You can still help!
Go to wbw.org and select the contribute tab. Here you can donate to give another student the opportunity to learn more about business during the summer.
Talk to your teen about enriching their education with a summer program such as Washington Business Week or a different program with their interests in mind. Get them to branch out and try something new!
Talk to your friends, family, neighbors, colleagues, anyone to get the word out about my campaign.
Share my campaign on Facebook. Tweet about my campaign; heck, use the hashtag #getme2poland if you want. Post it on Reddit. Blog about it on Tumblr. Do what you can to get my campaign around the Internet.

<h3>Violence, deceit, and power are evitable<br/>
</h3>

Moral competence is the ability to solve problems and conflicts on the basis of one's moral principles through thinking and discussion, instead of through violence, deceit, and power. Unfortunately, this competence is lacking in many people, not the least in many political and economic leaders.<br/><br/>The results of this shortage of moral competence are twofold: on the one side, a growing number of victims of violence, deceit, and power world-wide, who leave their homes to find a better life, and, on the other side political reflexes which make these victims' fate even worse: fences, racism, mobbing, deportation and bombing.<br/><br/>Obviously, the costs, in terms of money and life quality, of such morally stupid behavior  are extremely high. A couple billion dollars doesn't seem too high an estimate. Why does nobody get the idea that with a tiny fraction of the money wasted on fences, prisons, and bombs, we could build schools and train teachers and, thereby foster moral competence and reduce violence, deceit and power. Not possible? Well, I have seen many spots in the world where there is nearly no violence, deceit and power. Why should it be impossible to achieve this for the rest of the world?<br/><br/>OECD has calculated that the interest rate of investment in general education is much higher than any other investment. But their figures (about 8%) are based on conventional education. I believe that we could top these interest rates if we would introduce moral and democratic competence education in all schools world-wide. I believe this because I have tried it out in many countries.

</div></div>","TEEN INSIGHT LEADERSHIP MISSION STATEMENT:
 
We are Teen Insight Leadership, traveling the world and creating opportunities
to empower and support leaders of tomorrow by giving and receiving service
and connecting with the global community.
 
Can you support us in achieving our goal?  It
takes just $10....or more…
We have raised $58,000 so far and we are in are
final phase.  
Can you please please please help us reach our
goal of raising $117,000 to pay for our expenses and our workshops in Tanzania.
 
Why we are doing this:
This is an investment in the future, ours and yours.  We are
14 creative teenagers and young adults from the Los Angeles area that are creating
a Service Project to empower ourselves and the young people of Moshi, Tanzania.  This is a project we are creating for ourselves and for 600 students in Moshi, Tanzania.  We are working on this project with the support of our coach (the Director of the program) and are really proud of it.
 
We have found that we can accomplish anything when we set a clear
intention.  Our intention is to give back to the world and support other young
people in their growth.  This project in
Africa gives us an opportunity to learn practical skills of how to achieve our
goals, plan events on a large scale, go outside our comfort zone to ask for what we
need and manage our money and time.
 
The affect this project will have is exponential as
it is showing us how to take risks and create something larger than ourselves
and it is helping African kids further their education so they can start
creating the lives they want, too.
 
Project: 
The Journey to Tanzania Service Project
We will be in Tanzania from August 2-19, 2011.
In the fall of 2008, teen graduates of the Teen
Insight Leadership Program decided they wanted to give back and give back in a
big way.  They were understanding the value of service and wanted to make
the biggest impact they could.  So they researched and chose to travel to
Moshi, Tanzania in East Africa to partner with Knock Foundation (who ensure the
kids have food, shelter and access to education) to volunteer with a poverty
and AIDS stricken area.  We completed our first Journey to Tanzania
Service Project in August, 2009 and the teens fundraised the entire amount
they needed, even giving a small donation to Knock after we left. 
There have been over 60 teens selected to be part
of the Teen Insight Leadership Program.  They have taken all graduate
level seminars of Teen Insight and volunteered with many programs over the
course of at least 1 year.  
  
While in Tanzania in 2009, they built a new classroom
for the Kindergarden class, painted a Dream Tree Mural and repainted the front
of the school, facilitated Self Esteem Workshops for all the students of
Mrupanga Primary (the kids from Matumaini Orphanage attend this school) and
helped to create an Educator Workshop. 
This year we will be expanding to new primary
schools and opening up the Educator Workshops to all the teachers in Moshi.  
 
The Journey to Tanzania Service Project is an
opportunity for our new class of Graduates to Facilitate all the Self-Esteem
Workshops and English Classes, as well as, help to create the Educator
Workshops.
This is an amazing project to be working on at such
a young age.  
The group of teens and young adults begin in
February and start to fundraise for all of their expenses, as well as, learn
Swahili and help to create curriculum and special projects.  This is a 7
month process that culminates into the experience of a lifetime in
Tanzania. 
We invite you to join us in our project and donate
to help make this Service Project happen.  
We will keep donors updated on our progress before
we leave and email pictures once we are there.

A bit of history
The value and accessibility of education is
different in Tanzania than in the US.  Public schools in the US can be
free and taught in the same language we all speak.  Our intention is
to work with Primary Schools in Moshi to help them not only learn better
English so they can pass the test for Secondary School, but also see what the
possibility of achieving dreams can do for their future.
In Tanzania, government secondary schools have a
tuition around $15 USD per year plus fees. A typical private
school tuition is around $525 USD. This creates quite a burden on many families that
mostly make around $280 USD a year. It is even harder for large families,
single parent families and orphans. Families where the parents do not yet
appreciate the value of education, especially for girls, is often enough to

By law, all secondary education must be taught in
English. For many students, English is their third language.  In

This is why we are focusing on teaching English in

<p>We have developed the first online Model United Nation’s program, a project that allows any high school student, anywhere in the world, the ability to debate and discuss global issues through the Internet without any cost.</p>
<p>After a year of building and recruiting, the program is taking on some critical momentum, and is now spreading in places like Qatar, Somalia, Swaziland, China, India and the UK. Currently, we have students from over 30 countries, and this is just the beginning. You can listen to a condensed demo debate <a href=""http://goo.gl/5PR2S"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Here is what an O-MUN debate sounds like"">here.</a></p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>At the invitation of The Hague Model United Nations, one of the most prestigious MUN conferences in the world, a group of nine students will be travelling in January 2013 to present O-MUN to over 3500 students and their Directors. We have been able to secure a generous donation from a benefactor, but still have a shortfall in covering the conference fees, hotel and travel costs. In order for O-MUN to capitalize on this amazing opportunity, we need to secure additional funding. All told, this trip will cost in the range of $10, 000 USD, and raising even just $3, 000 will significantly ease the burden on our travel team. The cost breakdown is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>$2000 USD for registration fees</strong></p>
<p><strong>$8000 USD for hotel expenses for the delegation</strong></p>
<p>Any funds raised above our reg fees will be split evenly between team members to offset hotel costs.</p>
<p>We are very close to getting the global recognition that would allow us to launch a fully independent, not-for-profit educational organization, and presenting at the Hague will open these final doors for our on going expansion.</p>

<p><strong>Why This Matters</strong></p>
<p>Model United Nations is the largest academic role-playing simulation in the world. Students assume the role of a diplomat at the United Nations and then research, collaborate and debate issues like disarmament, human rights or the environment. All of these debates are held in a traditional face to face environment, often at huge expense to schools and families who wish to have their child experience this powerful academic simulation.</p>
<p>But many families simply cannot afford this expense. There are students who are not allowed to travel outside their cities due to safety or cultural reasons. Homeschooled students have few opportunities to attend conferences. In some countries, MUN simply does not exist.</p>
<p>Our first delegate from Somalia said:</p>
<p>“O-MUN makes me feel that I have the right to be part of global youth citizenry. Success cannot be measured in wealth, fame or power, but by whether you have made a positive difference for others, and that is what O-MUN is allowing me to do” Ugbad Kasim, Norther Somalia.</p>
<p>Absent expansive and diverse student representation, MUN debates lack a truly global nature. But students, logging into a virtual classroom from literally anywhere in the world, can discuss and debate important global issues. Technology becomes the great equalizer, making meaningful youth dialogue and collaboration an easy reality for many.</p>
<p>O-MUN is quickly developing into more than a debating program. It is a global youth leadership incubator. At a time when serious and seemingly intractable problems face us at every turn, young people need to be empowered with the knowledge and skills to move forward, become problems solvers and be skilled at finding consensus with people who are on the other side of the world.</p>
<p>All of us at O-MUN feel that we have created something that fills a real need: a global and inclusive program that builds community, promotes dialogue and discussion, and friendship between people.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you can’t contribute, but are a former MUN student or director, you can help us greatly by promoting this effort through your own channels. If you know of a business or organization that might be willing to contribute, please send them our campaign information. We have grown tremendously this past year. Your support gives us a much-needed boost. We hope we can count on your support, great or small, to help us make the world’s first truly global, online MUN program, a reality for thousands of students!</p>

Students assume the role of a diplomat at the United Nations and then research, collaborate and debate issues like disarmament, human rights or the environment. All of these debates are held in a traditional face to face environment, often at huge expense to schools and families who wish to have their child experience this powerful academic simulation.
But many families simply cannot afford this expense. There are students who are not allowed to travel outside their cities due to safety or cultural reasons. Homeschooled students have few opportunities to attend conferences. In some countries, MUN simply does not exist.
Our first delegate from Somalia said:
“O-MUN makes me feel that I have the right to be part of global youth citizenry. Success cannot be measured in wealth, fame or power, but by whether you have made a positive difference for others, and that is what O-MUN is allowing me to do” Ugbad Kasim, Norther Somalia.
Absent expansive and diverse student representation, MUN debates lack a truly global nature. But students, logging into a virtual classroom from literally anywhere in the world, can discuss and debate important global issues. Technology becomes the great equalizer, making meaningful youth dialogue and collaboration an easy reality for many.
O-MUN is quickly developing into more than a debating program. It is a global youth leadership incubator. At a time when serious and seemingly intractable problems face us at every turn, young people need to be empowered with the knowledge and skills to move forward, become problems solvers and be skilled at finding consensus with people who are on the other side of the world.
All of us at O-MUN feel that we have created something that fills a real need: a global and inclusive program that builds community, promotes dialogue and discussion, and friendship between people.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can’t contribute, but are a former MUN student or director, you can help us greatly by promoting this effort through your own channels. If you know of a business or organization that might be willing to contribute, please send them our campaign information. We have grown tremendously this past year. Your support gives us a much-needed boost. We hope we can count on your support, great or small, to help us make the world’s first truly global, online MUN program, a reality for thousands of students!",4.0,0,"3 Campaigns

</div></div>","LAMPA: Lesson & Activity Management, Planning & Access
 LAMPA is a completely unique, and potentially revolutionary, social/professional networking medium for educators connecting teachers all over the world and allowing them to create communities to exchange ideas, to learn from one another, to employ new methods and tools, and to use learning management infrastructure that they may not have access to otherwise. 
To complete and launch this project, we need to raise $34,500. We thank you for anything you are able to contribute; every little bit helps!
By supporting LAMPA, you will be providing tools to teachers and learners in every corner of the earth where the Internet is available and thus improving the quality of education.  


- Lance Adam LaSalle, Co-director, EdCentre School, s.r.o., Vsetín, Valašské Meziříči & Rožnov pod Radhoštěm  (http://www.centrumjazyku.cz)




The Need

Teachers need to be better connected through networks to encourage the free flow of ideas. Although social and professional networking (e.g. Facebook, Linked In) are omnipresent and there are many learning management system applications (e.g. Moodle) being used by school management, these technologies are not yet being used to their full potential. LAMPA integrates these concepts to focus on the needs of the teacher and learner.



- Hana Sívková (teacher & former English student) 

The Company
We are a small, private educational services company with a very big idea. At the moment, LAMPA consists of four team members. 
Our mission is to facilitate excellence in education with innovation.



Roman and Steve at work


So, what is LAMPA?

LAMPA is a simple, user-friendly networking platform that gives teachers all the tools they need to do their jobs well, no matter where they are located and whether they work alone or as part of an institution. In fact, the tools, support and infrastructure it provides are especially attractive to smaller schools and independent teachers since LAMPA is free and so easy to use. 


- Jana Rabštejnková (teacher)

LAMPA is:

social/professional networking for teachers

an electronic lesson planner and lesson tracking system

an activity writer, resource and library


a library for articles and lesson plans


a timetable management system


a grade and attendance book


a homework tracker 


a learning management system for school managers

a platform for learning games that reinforce material taught

a report writer

a personal vocabulary database (dictionary) for language learners



- Milagros Abon-Blazek (teacher)




What else does it do?



It reduces teacher workload
It improves quality and continuity
It communicates with learners and their guardians or corporate sponsors
It networks teachers and their students
It facilitates team teaching and substitute teaching



- Melinda Brasher (teacher)



It helps learners learn
It adds accountability to teaching
It increases the teacher's effectiveness
It provides access to supplementary learning materials




 - Michael J. Whittemore, Academic Director , Engish2Go, Heredia, Costa Rica. (http://www.english2go.co.cr)


System Testing


The original version of the system (without the global networking function) is currently being used on trial bases by language schools in the Czech Republic, Italy and Costa Rica. There have been roughly 3500 users to date including teachers, administrators, students and their parents or corporate sponsors. These users are very satisfied, but new modules must be completed and refinements must be made before we can take this ground-breaking concept and service to a global level.

What We Need
 To begin to bring LAMPA to teachers throughout the world, we need to raise $34,500. If we exceed our goal, we will invest more heavily in promoting the launch.
Approximately two thirds of the funds raised will go into funding programming activities. We estimate that this will take two months' work for three full-time programmers. Other activities and expenses will include social media marketing and perks and international shipping. The breakdown is as follows:









There is a sense of desperation in that, if we are not successful in meeting our self-imposed deadline of April 2015, we will miss the upcoming school year, and the developers will be challenged to continue investing their time and money as they need to provide for their families. However, should we fail to meet our goal, we will continue development to the best of our abilities, in the knowledge that we will not be able to complete and test the system in time. 
We trust that we have provided you with enough information that you are able to see the potential and how you and LAMPA can help educators around the world. 
Our own faith in this project's enormous potential is evidenced in the time, effort and resources we have already invested.
From Us to YouWe sincerely thank everyone who makes a contribution of any size! But we would also like you to have a token of our appreciation for helping us out. 

All contributors of $10.00 or more will be listed on the new MyLAMPA.com website. 


All individuals or organizations who help bring LAMPA to life by contributing $50.00 or more will be eligible to link a website to LAMPA's website and receive a certificate of thanks. 




Contributors in the amount of $75.00 - $249.00 will receive stylish limited edition LAMPA apparel and a certificate of thanks.





All those who contribute in excess of $250.00 are major sponsors and will be awarded a Sponsorship Certificate.

In addition to a personalized sponsorship certificate, we would like to offer major sponsors the opportunity to try out LAMPA as a learner in a Skype course. A course would also be a great idea as a unique and meaningful gift to a friend or loved one, or as a company perk. Study English, Spanish, German, Russian, Czech, Polish, Slovak or another subject, provided we can supply a teacher, in the privacy of your own home or office. Of course your learning will be managed using our new system, so you can be directly involved in the piloting - we would be thrilled to have your feedback!

Reach & ImpactConsidering English language teaching alone, the potential is massive. The British Council estimates that there are one billion people learning the English language world-wide. If we are able to reach 0.1% of the teachers and learners only in that market, LAMPA would be helping 1 million people. In addition to the 1 billion English language learners, LAMPA is universal in its appeal for any teacher of any subject. 




A group of teachers mingling at a LAMPA workshop

The peer-to-peer social media nature of the system will allow LAMPA to expand exponentially. Many teachers already use social media services such as Linked In and Facebook, so they are used to this type of medium.  Furthermore, these same teachers and their schools can be reached relatively easily through these same existing social media with targeted campaigns. 



                                         Language teachers testing the system 

 LAMPA is ideal for smaller schools and independent teachers who may have limited technological know-how. LAMPA has been designed to be intuitive and easy to use, so it is not necessary for schools to have an IT administrator on staff - this is a criticism of traditional learning management systems.

 Risks & Challenges If we fail to meet our deadline with a quality product, we may fail to create the goodwill needed to grow and sustain demand. Of course, the risk of this happening depends on the amount of work we are able to complete before April 2015 - it is a matter of financing.
We know that our core system is solid. If we meet our funding goal, we are confident that the planned new modules can be added successfully to complete the system. 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you are interested in our project but are not in a position where you can make a financial contribution, you can still be part of LAMPA.
As you can imagine, a project such as this relies on 'word of mouth'. 



If you are a teacher or a school administrator, let us know you are interested and be part of the piloting;

E-mail this presentation to friends using Indiegogo share tools or share it on twitter or Facebook;
Share the link on Linked In;

Tell all of your teacher friends that LAMPA is coming; 


Let people know who work in human resources where they provide training activities for their employees; 


And tell language learners to mention it to their teachers.

<h2>About Grom: </h2>
<p><strong> Grom Magazine is a one of a kind, exciting new publication that builds kids up in their sport at all levels. Showcasing the top kids in the country and across the globe, as well as the undiscovered kids trying to get noticed. Each issue is filled with exciting photos, informative profiles, contest updates, and all sorts of fun and educational editorials. GROM Surf has definitely found its place amongst the established surf magazines by making an accessible platform for young grom surfers to get the exposure they deserve. Many of the competitive groms today are striving to make it to the pro ranks, but whichever road they choose, free surfer or competitor, every grom is stoked to ""make it in the mag"".</strong></p>
<h3>
<strong>Here's </strong><strong>The Vision:</strong>
</h3>
<p><em>SURF, SKATE, SNOW, AND MOTO- It is our dream to see all four magazines up and running. We want to see the kids in our community and yours get excited about a mag that they can be a part of, not just wonder what it would be like to actually ever get chance to make his or her debut. Some kids are looking for exposure, some just want to see whats happening. We want to help these groms to be constantly informed about ways to grow in their sport, as well as keeping them captivated by providing quality photos of the top groms doing the most progressive manuevers. GROM Surf has been our primary focus, and has had a great impact on the surf community. It is our goal to be able to help snow, skate and moto groms as well through our other three magazines. With the lack of capital to fund all four, we hope to launch them soon as we build momentum.</em></p>
<h3>Impact on the kids</h3>
<p>The reaction from kids when they discover that they really did ""make it in the mag"" is complete elation and very uplifting for there confidence and self esteem. So far, we have printed volumes 1 through 5 of GROM Surf, and volume 1 of GROM Snow, which has resulted in a ton of stoked groms and their parents following us on our website and FB page.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3>How we came to be:</h3>
<p><em> My name is Curt Hanneman. About 2 years ago I came up with the idea- GROM MAGAZINE, a group of action sports magazines devoted entirely to kids (GROMS) under the age of 18, where kids can ""get in the mag"" by just emailing their photos to us. Myself and two partners, Paul Smart and Rick Waring have been the driving force behind GROM. The youngest of my 4 kids is Eli, which loves to surf and skate, so we are continuosly going to surf and skate contests where all the little athletes are trying to make a name for themselves in the industry, hoping to one day ""get sponsored"". If you know much about the mainstream surf magazines, you are well aware that only the top names, maybe 1% at the most will ""make the mag"" the other 99% of kids in the surfing community would be unsuccessfull at getting their photo in a national publication. GROM has already published over a hundred undiscovered groms in the first 5 issues, as well as capturing epic photos of the top ranked and well sponsored groms.</em>  </p>

<h3>What is Movember?</h3>
<p>Mustache November: An opportunity to excuse inexcusable facial hair by virtue of doing so to raise awareness for a good cause.</p>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>An Afghan child working on the streets of Afghanistan selling gum, plastic bags, or car fresheners, or merely begging, earns on average $20/month to support his or her family.  For $20/month, we can compensate that family for sending its child to school.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href=""http://www.aschiana-foundation.org/sponsor-a-child.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aschiana</a>, our partner charity, helps the child attend school by providing them with food, clothing, stationery, and necessary hygiene supplies.  An adult member of the family is also encouraged to come to the center to participate in instructional programs.</p>
<p><strong>We hope to sponsor 8 children this coming year</strong>--at $300/year (which includes administrative costs), our target is $2400.  Any money we raise above this target will be directed to the Aschiana programs facing the greatest need at this time, be it education or healthcare.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We four mustachioed men are working in Kabul, Afghanistan.  We have worked with Aschiana in the past and can vouche personally for their credibility.</p>
<p>Our vital stats and facial hair evolution are as follows:</p>

Mustache November: An opportunity to excuse inexcusable facial hair by virtue of doing so to raise awareness for a good cause.
Our Goal
An Afghan child working on the streets of Afghanistan selling gum, plastic bags, or car fresheners, or merely begging, earns on average $20/month to support his or her family.  For $20/month, we can compensate that family for sending its child to school.
Additionally, Aschiana, our partner charity, helps the child attend school by providing them with food, clothing, stationery, and necessary hygiene supplies.  An adult member of the family is also encouraged to come to the center to participate in instructional programs.
We hope to sponsor 8 children this coming year--at $300/year (which includes administrative costs), our target is $2400.  Any money we raise above this target will be directed to the Aschiana programs facing the greatest need at this time, be it education or healthcare.


Who We Are
We four mustachioed men are working in Kabul, Afghanistan.  We have worked with Aschiana in the past and can vouche personally for their credibility.
Our vital stats and facial hair evolution are as follows:
Marin Susac (second from left): 6'2"", 95kg.  In the name of Sean Connery.  With a great mustache comes great responsibility!!!
Farouk Ramji (second from right): 5’9½”, 81kg.  Thin slick handlebars like smooth leather straps....My icon is Ravi Singh.
Nick Pugliese (far right): 5’9¾” 79kgs (1kg less than with a beard).  My scraggly and multi-colored ‘stache is referred to by his friends as Bork in honor of the Swedish Chef.  A shout out as well to the vast majority of the Village People.
Wayne Kennedy (bottom): 6', 90kg.  Lushessly thick with bold handlebars, my mo is called Ron which relates equally to two mustached greats Ron Burgundy and Jeremy.

<p>The fact is there are many teachers and students that are required to use royalty free or public domain music in their projects, lessons, video broadcasts and whatever creative projects they may have.</p>
<p>The problem is that MOST MODERN royalty free music is not very good and hard to find affordably. Also, not all schools are equipped with easy methods to deploy and share media amongst their students.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our project is to expand our current website and develop a multi-seat program that helps teachers, students and anyone else that would gain from an easy to use multi-seat music delivery interface. Also, we are to start a sound effect library. All music and sound effects will be professionally done with awesome royalty free terms to give you creative freedom to use our work in any of your creative productions. Even for commercial use!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Features of this multi seat program would be:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Auto Login Portal</li>
<li>Choice of Open or password protected accounts</li>
<li>Easy mass account creation with username and password generation</li>
<li>Account management tools (delete, add, edit, modify)</li>
<li>Fast immediate downloads</li>
<li>Great royalty free music and sound effects!</li>
<li>Any other ideas you have ?</li>

<p><img alt=""Why Us"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.atlproductionmusic.com/images/crowdfunding/title_why_us.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Why Us""/></p>
<p>There are a small handful of reputable royalty free, production and creative common music libraries.  But these other companies are not focused on your project. They have other sub-agendas in order to draw traffic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our PRIMARY goal is always to provide you great music and sound effects so that you can enhance YOUR creative project with little to no hassles from us. In line with keeping our focus on you, some of the features we want to grow into are:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Always creating quality and affordable music</li>
<li>Full length tracks</li>
<li>1 minute or 30 second edits from the full length tracks (coming soon)</li>
<li>5 to 15 second bumpers/stingers (coming soon)</li>
<li>Flawless looping segments (coming soon)</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Can we do it? Absolutely!! We have 15 years+ experience in music and entertainment technologies. We have 8 years experience in web development. PLUS, we have 6 years of previous experience in this industry of delivering production music online.</p>

<p><img alt=""Why Our Prices So Low"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.atlproductionmusic.com/images/crowdfunding/title_low_prices.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Why Our Prices So Low""/></p>
<p>First, we have to remember the whole point to this. EVERYONE is on a tight budget. Especially school budgets that keep on shrinking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We critically think about every decision and evaluate the most bank for our buck while always focusing on keeping our overhead low. Plus it helps that we have the musical and technical background to do everything in house. Just like recording artists are cutting out the record labels, we are producers cutting the middleman of publishing companies and certain marketing agencies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is our goal to be so affordable that a teacher or student with whatever income restraints, can afford our music. The stereotypical starving musician and songwriter can afford our music to build from and practice their skills.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also we are not trying to take over any industry. We just want to be a great tool in your tool box for creative production work. When you fix a car or do something in web development, or many other analogies I can think of, there are often more than one set of tools you use. We simply want to be that trusty wrench that is always there for you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the library grows naturally certain costs will rise and our prices will also slightly rise. But they will always be small, modest and justifiable. (Check out our life time discount club below)</p>

<p> </p>
<p> Before we go through the details of our perks let me help make one thing clear.</p>

<p>My name is Melinda and my husband is Tom. We were married on April 2004.  We met, dated, got engaged, married like any other couple.  The next step having a family never happened, because I can not have kids. </p>
<p>I have Primary Premature Ovarian Failure.  In short, my ovaries have no eggs.  I have had this since I was a teen and the only way I could ever have a baby is with Donor Egg and IVF or adoption. IVF will cost about $30,000 adoption costs $52,000. I would be happy with either option.  We just want a child.  I have insurance but it will not cover fertility treatment.  We are foster parents but after 16 months of having a beautiful little girl she had to leave to live with relatives and the room that was fit for a princess is now empty complete with everything but, a baby and we have a heavy heart. </p>
<p>We want a chance to have a forever child that we can watch grow up.  We want to be a mommy and daddy. Look at your child or children, they are truely a blessing.  Could you imagine a life without them? Many people say they are the most important thing in their life.  Simpily we want a chance to have that too.  I know it sounds simple but, for us its a dream that we can not make a reality without asking for the help of others. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Anything over that would go to another couple that has wanted the same as us for a long time. Maybe give another family hope as well or used to help fund programs in the community that focus on youth and children.</p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What impact did your kids have on you?  If you have kids you know the joys of being a parent. </p>
</div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

My name is Melinda and my husband is Tom. We were married on April 2004.  We met, dated, got engaged, married like any other couple.  The next step having a family never happened, because I can not have kids. 
I have Primary Premature Ovarian Failure.  In short, my ovaries have no eggs.  I have had this since I was a teen and the only way I could ever have a baby is with Donor Egg and IVF or adoption. IVF will cost about $30,000 adoption costs $52,000. I would be happy with either option.  We just want a child.  I have insurance but it will not cover fertility treatment.  We are foster parents but after 16 months of having a beautiful little girl she had to leave to live with relatives and the room that was fit for a princess is now empty complete with everything but, a baby and we have a heavy heart. 
We want a chance to have a forever child that we can watch grow up.  We want to be a mommy and daddy. Look at your child or children, they are truely a blessing.  Could you imagine a life without them? Many people say they are the most important thing in their life.  Simpily we want a chance to have that too.  I know it sounds simple but, for us its a dream that we can not make a reality without asking for the help of others. 
 
What We Need & What You Get
Anything over that would go to another couple that has wanted the same as us for a long time. Maybe give another family hope as well or used to help fund programs in the community that focus on youth and children.

The Impact
What impact did your kids have on you?  If you have kids you know the joys of being a parent. 

Other Ways You Can Help
I know times are hard and any amount would help us get one step closer. If you cant help maybe you know someone who could?  Thank you for taking the time to read this and please keep us in your prayers.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>After
years of teaching at a distance, and designing and creating instructional
multimedia for online classes, I realized that effective tools to teach and
create lessons or presentations for online environments are a real necessity.  Certainly, tools to create presentations are
available, but none or few of them were originally designed for distance teaching or
learning. Moreover,<b><i> most tools are simply too expensive for a single teacher to
afford!</i></b></p>
<p>This realization was the beginning of
the <i><b>E-Lustrate Tutor project</b></i>.  We have been working in this project for the
past three years.</p>

Short Summary

Hi, Welcome to the E-Lustrate Tutor Project!




I have been teaching for several American universities for
more than 30 years. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, a
Master of Science degree in Management Information Systems, and a Doctoral
degree in Instructional Technology and Distance Education.

After
years of teaching at a distance, and designing and creating instructional
multimedia for online classes, I realized that effective tools to teach and
create lessons or presentations for online environments are a real necessity.  Certainly, tools to create presentations are
available, but none or few of them were originally designed for distance teaching or
learning. Moreover, most tools are simply too expensive for a single teacher to
afford!
This realization was the beginning of
the E-Lustrate Tutor project.  We have been working in this project for the
past three years.



This campaign is aimed to raise funds
to finish the development of E-Lustrate Tutor: A convenient set of tools for creating engaging multimedia presentations for online learning This set of tools WILL BE FREE FOR EVERYONE who
wants to teach or train at a distance.

What We Need 

E-Lustrate Tutor is a set of tools which
are approximately 70% of final stage. This campaign will help the final development and support of E-Lustrate Tutor. 
After the initial development of the software, there will be more efforts not only to support the platform but also to constantly improve and develop of more options and game skins (templates).
Any funds collected will be invested in the development of E-Lustrate Tutor. The goal is to raise funds to finish the initial development by next year. If less than expected is raised, it will take more time to finish the software tools... but IT WILL BE FINISHED!

Recommended Workforce needed:



One Junior Computer Programmer.


One Senior Computer Programmer.


One Assistant (marketing).


One General Manager / Coordinator.


Note: Office Spaces will also be required to have
comfortable working environment for Research & Development.
Watch the Full Estimated Three-Year Financial projections here.





What You Get

There are different ways you can contribute by selecting a Perk of your choice. Your contribution will allow anyone who wants to teach or train at a distance to:




 Contribute to have a better ""educated"" world.


 Have access to rapid development educational contents and distribution set of tools.


 Create ""Knowledge Networks"" around a set of lessons or presentations.


 Easily add gaming  as a teaching - learning strategy.


 Get usability and analytic data about the lessons or presentations.


 Get paid for teaching what you already know.


 Have a free tool to develop and charge for lessons or presentations.




The Impact



The relationship between education and economic
growth is a fact. Additionally, there is a great need for tools that facilitate
the creation and distribution of educational contents and that support
sustainable learning networks. There are great benefits for everyone involved:
students, teachers,  instructional designers and whoever wants to teach and get compensated.



The knowledge and e-learning industries, as well as online learning offerings in higher education and K-12, are constantly growing in the United States and globally. These large sectors are potential target markets for a tool like E-Lustrate Tutor.  
 There is actually a huge market in the educational area with, 7.2 million teachers only in the United States and more than 78 million in the world. These numbers do not include instructional designers or simple people who have something they can teach.
For example, the elearning industry, according
to GSV Asset Management (2012), is expected to growth 15% in the next few years in the
United State and globally a 23%. The Knowledge or Educational industry
sector, is expected to growth over the next decade.

The bottom line is that there
is a real need for  affordable and effective tools to create and distribute engaging multimedia for teaching and learning.  E-Lustare would be an attractive option to
fill such a gap: It will be free for anyone to create lessons or presentations!
Risks & Challenges


In any entrepreneurial endeavor, there
are risks and challenges that pertain to the characteristics of the business
itself.  
E-Lustrate tools are software
applications and, as such, developing them entails the investment of significant
time and effort in computer programming and markting. Hence, all possible resources and hard
work would be invested in computer programming and advertising in order to finalize the
product.
Some  main modules are almost fully developed. Thus, it is unlikely that
anything can go ""wrong"" while finalizing the product.

About Us

Chapter 510 is an 826-inspired, volunteer-powered organization that provides in-school tutoring,
creative and expository writing workshops, and publishing opportunities for
K-12 students in Oakland.This September, we found our permanent space at 2301 Telegraph in downtown Oakland, bringing us closer to our vision of building a writing center and community space to serve as a dynamic resource for all students, families, teachers, and volunteers. We've got the space. Now we need your help in raising $50,000 to bring in the programming and resources necessary to transform it into an inspiring and inclusive space for Oakland youth.How
Your Support Will HelpHave you ever tried to write a thrilling story about killer robots without paper or a computer? Or learned to love reading without a library full of books to choose from? Our vision for Chapter 510's writing center is as an inclusive space constantly buzzing with creative inspiration, where students come after school to receive personalized tutoring and where field trippers get so fired up about the books they created in our writing workshops that they run joyous laps round and around their classrooms once they get back to school.

Jade, MetWest High School student: ""When I walked into Chapter 510's new building, I told them they had to open their writing center right away. You should donate to them because it will help give kids like me have a place to go after school to become a better writer.""
Your $50,000 will be used in the following ways:1. Construction: We need $10,000 to make needed improvements to our writing center in January and February, including new floors and ceilings.2. Equipment: $12,000 will go towards acquiring computers for 35 students; mic + PA for readings; and book-making, printing, and binding equipment.3. Furniture and fixtures: In order to seat all our young writers during our after-school tutoring, writing and bookmaking workshops, and student reading events, we need $8,000 for tables, chairs, shelves, and light fixtures. 3. Supplies and books: Another $6,000 will go buy journals, pens, paper, books for our reading library, and many, many after-school snacks (don't ever try to tutor a hungry anybody!).4. Teaching artists and staff: In order to add programming to our center, and maintain programming with our partner schools, we're asking our community for $14,000 to pay for program staff, including our teaching artists and bookmaker in residence who will help us set up and start programming in our new buildingWhere We're Going Beyond this Campaign (Two-Year Plan) In September, we signed a five year lease with architects Erik Bloom and Todd Bennett of Parcel Projects, and we'll be working in close partnership with them over the next two years to transform our space into a student-led writing and making ecosystem. Students will have multiple access points, from reading in our student-curated library, writing with volunteer tutors and teaching artists, bookmaking with professional equipment and supplies, and, for older students, designing and publishing student books to be sold in our retail space and in bookstores throughout Oakland. Your support
will ensure that Chapter 510, in partnership with OUSD and the Oakland
Public Library, continues to act as a catalyst for change in addressing
literacy issues in Oakland. 





Wendy Donner, Abundance Foundation: ""I give because Chapter 510 is a thoughtful, inspiring community of amazing people. Thank you for all that you have done and continue to do to bring 510 to youth in Oakland!""

projects to change the way of thinking in humans and show how are a healthy environment and the nature important things for human.I am Dragoljub Milankov.Our team is currently small, but day by day it's becoming bigger,and our ideas are becoming more serious.Our hobby, like our projects, are based on making interesting things,so-called pieces of art,out of materials which man thinks are useless and throws them away in nature,making it polluted.</p><h2>What is recycling?</h2><p>Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into reusable materials and objects.It is an alternative to ""conventional"" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions (compared to plastic production,for example).Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage,air pollution (from incineration) and water pollution (from landfilling).In the strictest sense,recycling of a material would produce a fresh supply of the same material—for example,used office paper would be converted into new office paper,or used polystyrene foam into new polystyrene.However,this is often difficult or too expensive (compared with producing the same product from raw materials or other sources),so ""recycling"" of many products or materials involves their reuse in producing different materials (for example,paperboard) instead.Another form of recycling is the salvage of certain materials from complex products,either due to their intrinsic value (such as lead from car batteries,or gold from circuit boards),or due to their hazardous nature (e.g., removal and reuse of mercury from thermometers and thermostats).</p><p><img class=""lazy""

more applications of a material, then the material becomes useless to him, and he tries to get rid of it,in this case,without thinking, he throws it into the nature (rivers, oceans, forests).Think about it,when you buy juice or some other drink,you drink the content of the bottle and throw it away,without thinkg you could use it elsewhere.In this case,you can apply them on your  own ship construction and with a very small investment you can enjoy the charms of rivers,seas, nature in general.However, the ship is not the only product we can produce out of plastic and glass bottles.There is a range of products that we will Introduce to you, as, for example,flower pots, lamps, car garages, various containers and even the house in which will be enjoyable to live.These products are so well done that you won't believe they were made from bottles.Because we need to produce plastic bottles of all products, we will start collecting bottles from rivers,seas,oceans,forests, nature in general and in this way we will gradually reduce the pollution of these surfaces.So this project and these products are not only important for us,but for the whole community and the world.We are ready to produce the following interesting things:</p><h3>1.Vertical Garden</h3><p><img class=""lazy""

<h2><strong>WHAT IS SAALY</strong></h2>
<p>SAALY is an <strong>educational outreach program</strong> authored by <strong>Cheryl Maletta Trujillo</strong> of <strong>Zanbeel Art</strong>, a South Asian cultural resource for Visual Art, Literature, Film and Music. <strong>The program strives to build bridges between the U.S and South Asia via art classes and art exchanges in low income schools in both countries.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>SAALY'S FIRST PROJECT</strong></h3>
<p>The global budget crisis led to cutbacks in school art programs all over the world. In 2011, Zanbeel Art launched a program called ""<strong>South Asian Art Literacy for Youth</strong>"" (SAALY).</p>
<p>Geared to tackle this problem head on, SAALY made its debut in October 2011 with its pilot at The Watts Elementary School in South Los Angeles.</p>
<p>An underprivileged school district, many students at this elementary school never had the opportunity to take art classes previously and knew virtually nothing about the South Asian region. Zanbeel Art handpicked accomplished artists to teach weekly art classes to the 5th grade on topics including portraits, sculpture, calligraphy, photography, endangered species, and herb planting.</p>
<p>The artists/teachers utilized creative tools such as visual projections, maps, and various art materials to help the students build essential critical thinking skills and an ability to see the world from a new perspective. Teachers worked closely with students to help transform negative thoughts and assumptions they may have about South Asia into a deeper understanding, empathy, and mutual respect for the region and its people. </p>
<p>The purpose of the classes was to trigger a nine-week intellectual transformation of the students by expanding their understanding of the idea of culture and encouraging them to become citizens of the world. Activities were focused on developing skills needed to live and work effectively in culturally and politically diverse societies.</p>
<p>Each class closely followed Los Angeles public school guidelines in areas such as Social Studies and Geography, and incorporated K-12 education standards which will be in affect in 2013. All classes were designed in 2010 by Zanbeel board member and education expert Cheryl Maletta Trujillo of California State University, Dominguez Hills.</p>
<h3><strong>CONTINUING SAALY PROJECTS</strong></h3>
<p><strong>SAALY 2011 was so successful that The Watts Elementary School invited Zanbeel Art back to implement SAALY 2012. Although the core of the program will remain the same, 6 additional classes will be added to the original 9 session curriculum in order to incorporate a creative exchange with students from similar socioeconomic backgrounds in Pakistan, where the students will be encouraged to share commonalities and embrace differences. The Pakistani side of it will be handled by The Citizens Archive of Pakistan.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>IMPACT</strong></h2>
<p>Students who participated in SAALY 2011 saw a significant jump in their grades, confidence, and understanding of the South Asian region.</p>
<p><span>The program this year will include a creative exchange between students in Los Angeles, CA and Karachi, Pakistan with the intention of fostering a better understanding among our youth for a more tolerant, peaceful future. </span>During SAALY 2012 we will be collecting rubric at regular intervals throughout the process, with additional surveys designed by our Pakistani counterparts to specifically assess the results of the exchange. The data will be quantified into a final report to assess it's impact on students in both countries. <strong><br/></strong></p>
<h2><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></h2>
<p>Zanbeel Art has worked hard to minimize the costs of this project. We are fortunate to be surrounded by a wonderful community of volunteers and teachers who are decidated to this project and are donating their time and efforts free of charge. However, we do need money to underwrite the costs of the art supplies, lunch and transport costs for our amazing teachers, courier costs for students in the U.S and Pakistan to exchange creative projects, and a small stipend for the artists who will be taking out precious time to work with the school in conducting these workshops.</p>
<p>All in all, we can implement this amazing project for a total of just $4200, and we are grateful for your support in helping us build bridges for a better future. However small your monetary contribution may be (even if you can only spare a few dollars), it will signify your commitment to peace and education, and will enable us to implement this project. </p>
<h3><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone is in a position to make a monetary contribution. You can still help us by offering to volunteer, spreading the word, making some noise about our campaign using the IndieGoGo share tools on your social media sites!</p>
<h2><strong>ABOUT ZANBEEL ART</strong></h2>
<p>Zanbeel Art is a South Asian cultural resource for Visual Art, Literature, Film and Music. Zanbeel Art's vision is to provide exposure to established and emerging South Asian artists, and to enrich and inspire students in low socio economic regions in the US and South Asia via art related educational outreach programs.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Last October a friend and colleague of ours became extremely ill. Mr. Mark Davison, a Social Studies Teacher at Iroquois High School, was diagnosed with Pulmonary Fibrosis and several other serious conditions of his lungs. He was in a coma for close to eight weeks, and hospitalized for over ten months. His condition has resulted in placement upon a list at the Cleveland Clinic to receive a lung transplant. Needless to say, Mark has accumulated significant medical and personal expenses throughout his ordeal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mark is a revered and selfless individual and teacher who is well respected throughout the community. Time after time, he has given his own personal time freely to create a learning environment which allows students to excel. Likewise, his devotion to the students is found in his involvement in numerous extracurricular activities including taking students to Europe for the past seven years, and Gettysburg for over fifteen years. His influence and inspiration has been acknowledged by his students throughout his twenty year career in education.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is our goal to assist Mark in any way possible. Through a financial fundraising campaign, we are hoping to help Mark offset some of the mounting medical and personal expenses brought on by this unfortunate illness. Thus, we have developed an aggressive fundraising campaign to assist Mark and his wife, Carol. Any help that you, your business or your organization can afford Mark will be greatly appreciated. Mark and Carol thank you in advance for any assistance you or your group can offer. Mark has given so much of himself in his teaching career, and we are hoping to find some way to give back to him during his time of need.  Your generosity is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time and consideration.                  </p></span></div>","Mr. Mark Davison: Teacher, Friend, Role Model.

</li> </ul> <h4> </h4><h4 style=""text-align: center;"">Thanks for visiting and stay rad folks! </h4></div>","Our Opportunity: Food Access at Temple University
Our market research showed that 86% of Temple Students are unsatisfied with the food offerings on campus 
We launched our ""Real Food Campaign"" in 2014 to see what ""real food"" meant to students 
The answer was clear- real food is not readily accessible on Temple's campus...unless pizza, french fries and chicken fingers are what you consider to be real food 
Who We Are We are a group of students dedicated to provide ethical, organic, and sustainable food options.  We'll have a co-op café on Temple University's campus.  Silmultaneously, our sourcing policy aims to sustain the greater Philadelphia local economy. 
Students get a hands on educational experience running a business
Connects students across all schools: business, communications, film, geography and urban studies, engineering, art, and more 
Academic and social venture

Integrated with Temple curriculum as an Independent study course
Taking ownership and responsibility for our community
The Rad Dish Co-op will open at Temple on October 31, 2014. We'll open in an existing cafe located on campus.  It's fully equipped with dine-in seating. We will feature: 

Made-to-order food and bulk produce


Local, organic, and fair-trade inventory 
What We Need & What You Get
We need $5,000 for start-up inventory and labor costs
Start-up inventory: prepared foods, bulk produce items, coffee, and tea
Labor costs: help us compensate our workers above minimum wage

We support the efforts of Philabundance andPhiladelphia Urban Creators. We'll send you proof of our volunteer hours and highlights from our shifts within 60 days of your donation. Help us and we'll contribute to the greater movement towards ending food deserts in Philadelphia! 
The Impact
 
The first student-run food cooperative in Philadelphia 
The only readily available fresh, sustainable food on Temple's main campus  
Our sourcing policy requires food to be local (organic or fair-trade if local isn't possible)
The Green Movement: zero-waste policy with compostable waste containers and packaging, and incentives for customers to bring their own packaging and bags
Helping to sustain the hands-on education experience offered through Rad Dish   Risks & Challenges  We do recognize that we face the following risks in starting up our co-op:  Inability to accept credit cards due to high fees associated The university's breaks may affect sales during holidays and between semesters 
Our food will not be on the meal-plan offered by Temple University
The high cost of marketing materials 
Other Ways You Can Help If you are unable to donate at this time, don't worry, you can still help!

<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>Congress has a 9% approval rating ... which is less than the estimated 15% to 20% approval rating of the British Empire during the Revolutionary War in 1776.  <span class=""notranlsate""><br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">The American 
people are unhappy with the representatives that they have elected yet 
they often cannot explain exactly what the representatives have done to 
earn their disapproval. In order to promote effective change in our 
government, our project will allow individuals to be able to pinpoint 
exactly what it is that their representatives voted on that they 
disapprove of. </span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/122036/files/20131008175001-9__.jpg?1381279801"" src="""" style=""width: 473.73px; height: 310px;""/></p></span></span><p>Why do Americans not know the details of every 
bill that is being debated in Congress on a daily basis? No one has the 
time to read the bills! Even the representatives of our government have 
admitted that they oftentimes do not have time to read the bills that 
they are voting on. Does anyone else see something wrong with that?</p>
<p>Legislation,
 besides constantly being amended and debated, tends to be hundreds of 
pages long. We believe that the average individual does not have time to
 read hundreds of pages of bills per day and they therefore choose to 
opt out of participating in government. </p></span><p></p>
<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><h1>Our Solution <br/>
</h1>
<p>We read all of the bills that are being debated in Congress on a daily basis. We then summarize the bills in a nonpartisan way and put them up for vote on The Fourth Branch website. The first time an individual comes onto our website, they sign up for our free service by giving us their address. We then use that address to tell the individual exactly who their Senators and House of Representatives members are along with the contact information for those representatives. </p>
<p>Once a user votes on a bill summary, and their elected representative's vote on that same bill in Congress, we then send the users an email telling them who their elected representatives are, how they voted on the issues presented, and the contact information of their representatives. If there is any discrepancy, users will be able to instantly contact their elected officials from our website and pinpoint exactly what topic they disagree on with their representatives.</p>
<p>We are creating a system of transparency and accountability for our government. By using our platform, individuals will no longer have to worry about spending hours upon hours researching political topics and what their representatives think about the issues presented. Users will be able to come onto our website, read our summaries of the bills, and vote for them in three minutes or less. Afterwards we welcome users to comment on the issues and engage in thoughtful discussions with other members of The Fourth Branch community. We strive to create an experience in which the entire voting and commenting process does not take longer than 5 minutes a day.</p>
<p>We are creating a time efficient way for any American with an internet connection to participate in their government.</p></span></span><h1>

Congress has a 9% approval rating ... which is less than the estimated 15% to 20% approval rating of the British Empire during the Revolutionary War in 1776.  
The American 
people are unhappy with the representatives that they have elected yet 
they often cannot explain exactly what the representatives have done to 
earn their disapproval. In order to promote effective change in our 
government, our project will allow individuals to be able to pinpoint 
exactly what it is that their representatives voted on that they 
disapprove of. 
Why do Americans not know the details of every 
bill that is being debated in Congress on a daily basis? No one has the 
time to read the bills! Even the representatives of our government have 
admitted that they oftentimes do not have time to read the bills that 
they are voting on. Does anyone else see something wrong with that?
Legislation,
 besides constantly being amended and debated, tends to be hundreds of 
pages long. We believe that the average individual does not have time to
 read hundreds of pages of bills per day and they therefore choose to 
opt out of participating in government. 
Our Solution 

We read all of the bills that are being debated in Congress on a daily basis. We then summarize the bills in a nonpartisan way and put them up for vote on The Fourth Branch website. The first time an individual comes onto our website, they sign up for our free service by giving us their address. We then use that address to tell the individual exactly who their Senators and House of Representatives members are along with the contact information for those representatives. 
Once a user votes on a bill summary, and their elected representative's vote on that same bill in Congress, we then send the users an email telling them who their elected representatives are, how they voted on the issues presented, and the contact information of their representatives. If there is any discrepancy, users will be able to instantly contact their elected officials from our website and pinpoint exactly what topic they disagree on with their representatives.
We are creating a system of transparency and accountability for our government. By using our platform, individuals will no longer have to worry about spending hours upon hours researching political topics and what their representatives think about the issues presented. Users will be able to come onto our website, read our summaries of the bills, and vote for them in three minutes or less. Afterwards we welcome users to comment on the issues and engage in thoughtful discussions with other members of The Fourth Branch community. We strive to create an experience in which the entire voting and commenting process does not take longer than 5 minutes a day.
We are creating a time efficient way for any American with an internet connection to participate in their government.

<p><span>In order to provide this amazing opportunity for children, we need to rent a park, event insurance, organize and prepare three meals a day (plus snacks!) for the duration, and arrange transport, housing, etc. Plus, of course, we want to spend all the time there doing Junior Wobbly activities!
