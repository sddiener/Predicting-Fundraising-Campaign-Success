<h3>What is Lad Named Felix?</h3>
<p>Lad Named Felix is inspired by glam rock, vintage quirk, and timeless style. Industrial and precious metals, gemstones, crystal, and glass play alongside unique found components, and the whole thing is peppered with sarcasm, sharp wit, and a modern edge. Described by fans as ""retro-future glam"", LNF's goal is create bold and versatile handmade statement pieces that move seamlessly from day to night and inspire their wearers to try a little transformation.</p>
<p>LNF is a Chicago-based small business run completely from the designer's loft, and has been a direct hit at dozens of art shows, gallery openings, and street festivals since 2009. LNF is proud to have styled the likes of such bands as A Sound of Thunder and Chicago's own GIRLBAND, and is currently available in select boutiques in the US.</p>
<p>During a half year's hiatus battling throat cancer, Lad Named Felix's owner and designer Jason P. Pike was unable to work, so the steady growth and evolution the line had enjoyed prior to his diagnosis halted. But he's back just in time for awards season!</p>
<p>Well, HE'S not going. The necklaces are. Don't get confused. Anyway. We'll get to that.</p>
</div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>So What's the Story?</h3>
<div>While spending a quiet afternoon stirring a pot of chili and wearing nothing but black underwear, LNF's owner and designer Jason P. Pike heard the jingle on his phone signalling a new email. He rolled his eyes at the interruption, but set the spoon down and swiped the screen open.</div>
<div>
<p><em>[Lad Named Felix] Golden Globe Awards Gift Bag Sponsorship Offer</em></p>
<p>So he opened it. Wouldn't you? Well, even if you <em>wouldn't</em>, he <strong>did</strong>. Which brings us to why we are gathered here today.</p>
<p>Lad Named Felix was scouted at it's <a href=""http://shopladnamedfelix.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Shop Lad Named Felix"">website</a> for this AMAZING opportunity and received a personal invitation: Include LNF's retro-future, glam rock radio pieces in the extremely exclusive VVIP gift bags that will be given to the Top 25 nominees at the 2013 Golden Globes.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, baby. V-VIP. Very VERY Important Persons. Extra adverb. That's HOT.</p>
<p><strong>Twenty-five Limited Edition pieces, created specifically for the 2013 Golden Globes, will be designed and created 100% by hand, and have the chance to be photographed, seen by celebrity stylists, and receive national press. Tier Nine sponsors will also be on the exclusive list of owners of this gorgeous piece, which will be revealed soon!<br/></strong></p>
Every small business needs it's Big Break, a golden moment,...and there is no gold more shiny than the Golden Globes. The exposure, the press, and the sheer glamour are more than enough reason to aim for the stars. At the end of the day, this campaign isn't just about going to the movies.<strong> It's about propelling a small business forward.</strong>
</div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>But we need your help to make it happen.<strong><br/></strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What Will My Contributions Make Possible?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sponsorship Fee!</strong> LNF's mad negotiation skills ended in a stellar offer and a reduced fee for our sponsorship of the the 2013 Golden Globes VVIP gift bags. $600 of the goal will be used to pay that fee. Sponsorships are an industry-standard method of marketing, and for the Golden Globes, go as high as $20K. Who needs spa packages and free trips to Tahiti if you don't have your LNF, anyway?</li>
<li>
<strong>Materials!</strong> Used to create twenty five custom designed, limited edition Lad Named Felix necklaces, this will include all chain, gemstones, crystal, clasps, custom-stamped LNF signature tags, and the tiny little trappings of jewelry design required to build each limited edition LNF piece. With your help, LNF will make the other items in those nominee gift bags look paltry, plain, positively plebeian.</li>
<li>
<strong>Packaging! </strong>Imagine opening a sleek leather box and finding a LNF necklace dripping with glamour worthy not just of the Golden Globes and it's esteemed nominees, but in keeping with LNF's established history of quality, high style and unexpected glamour.</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing collateral! </strong>Pieces of art themselves, these sexy, limited edition postcards will tell the <em>Who's Who</em>, the <em>What's What</em>, and the <em>Huh, What's That?</em> of Lad Named Felix. Those of you who have purchased the appropriate Perks will not only see your name as official sponsors of LNF,  but wlll receive copies signed by LNF's designer, Jason P. Pike, perfect for making your friend wither in jealousy.</li>
<li>
<strong>Shipping!</strong> LNF has yet to invent a way for necklaces to fly to their new owners around the globe, so it's FedEx with insurance, delivery confirmation, and required signature.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>And, should your generosity and dedication to all things uncommon, eccentric, and sparkly <em>exceed</em> the $1,000 goal, the extra funding will go toward:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A Lad Named Felix Lookbook</strong>. Lookbooks are essential tools for marketing anything in the weird world of fashion. Many press outlets, boutiques, and even galleries will not give an company a second chance without one...so...a small portion of extra funding will be partially spent to create one from LNF's existing editorial, studio, and candid photography, as well as hire a photographer to shoot new collections.</li>
<li>
<strong>Get a Bit of Help!</strong> Think ""The Devil Wears Prada"", but with less psychological torment. Contributions that put us over the mark will allow LNF to compensate friends and colleagues to help make this small business' dream come true. These superstars will assist in ensuring each parcel is perfect, and will pop a bottle of cheap champagne when the pieces are officially shipped. When the hangover is gone the next day, they will assist in ensuring perks go out on time.</li>
<li>
<strong>A cheap bottle of champagne!</strong> See above.</li>
<li>
<strong>Website Development</strong>. Jason is not a techie. We need help. Big help.</li>
<li>
<strong>Adding extras to your Perks! </strong>Could be a piece created exclusively for LNF's Indiegogo backers. Could be exclusive discount codes or secret sales. Could be a signed cheesecake photo of Jason. Guess you'll just wait and see...</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Should your altruism truly go beyond any reasonable expectation, pushing us past the $2000 mark and beyond, LNF will post new ""Stretch Goals"", each with their own amazing Perks that will be rewarded to contributors once the stretch goals have been met! More news as it develops...</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Damn You and Your Sparkles! I'm in. What do I do?</h3>
<p>Awesome. You'll find the funding denominations to the right of this amazing copy, each with their own perks! All you need to do is determine your contribution, and BLAMMO. Get to contributin'.</p>
<p>Perks get more exclusive by Tiers. The date all Perks will be shipped will be sent at campaign's end to all contributors. Any and all questions can be directed at <em>ladnamedfelix(at)gmail(dot)com.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sponsors</strong>: All contributors $50 and up will be listed as official LNF Sponsors on the postcards included in the VVIP Golden Globes gift bags and at shopladnamedfelix.com.

<h3>ANNOUNCEMENT:</h3>
<div class=""activity-content"">
<p>The campaign has taken a fabulous new direction! As we enter the final days we are proud to announce that any further funds recieved through this campaign will be utilized in the production of a fantastic fundraiser fashion show and auction on June 28th in Seattle! The show, entitled BeDecked! will bring together Artists and Designers from around the Northwest and help springboard us to our final goal both in recognition and finances. Your support is greatly appreciated, especially if you are unable to make it to the show on the 28th! Thanks again for supporting Lime Light Fashion!</p>

<h3>The Story/The Vision</h3>
Thank you for taking the time to check out my campaign!
<p align=""left"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><img alt=""Flyer"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/202212/pictures/full/20120404141811-flyer2.jpg?1333574314"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p align=""left"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Lime Light Fashion is currently a teeny tiny one-woman web based business providing hard to find stage jewelry, one of a kind super-glam clothing items, specialized costume accessories and custom costuming services to the stage performer, pageant community and women of all ages for special occasions. The goal of my project is to raise money to open a costume, gown and accessories warehouse superstore/fashion show &amp; music venue in Seattle. Let me share a little bit about the overall vision:</p>
<p align=""left"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Lime Light</span> Fashion Playland will be a true destination shopping experience. We'll carry Angelique Ashton Designs of course, as well as the cutting edge designs of a couple fellow designers I already have lined up, pageant and stage jewelry, specialized performance needs such as belly dance accessories, rodeo/western wear, burlesque and ballroom costumes, corsets, hats, tu-tus, feather boas, heels and evening gowns . . . but the main attraction will be that the store has a runway and a full stage for live shows. It will be a boutique by day where ladies can pick up anything their heart desires for a costume or performance, and will be encouraged to step out of the dressing room onto the runway to work it – then by night the place will transform into the city's premier fashion venue, hosting fashion shows, bachelorette parties, and musical acts. <span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"">On a regular basis, the store will host Lime Light events to showcase local talent and provide fashion students and new designers opportunities to have their work seen. </span></span></p>
<p align=""left"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style="""">It will be a world unto itself, a parallel universe where a girl can still play dress up, no matter her age. It will be a safe place, where people are free to express who they are and have fun with it. Our multifaceted mission will be to spread glitter all over the community, promote self-esteem in teens and young women, promote safe and natural cosmetics and support the local Artist and fashion community. It will be the shimmery ethereal magical princess wonderland from inside my head, on the outside of my head. We will have champagne and cupcakes and live unicorns. I thought about cotton candy, but honestly, I'm not sure I want people with sticky fingers handling everything and petting my unicorns. I mean, they aren't self-bathing like cats . . .</span></p>
<p align=""left"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""""><img alt=""costume examples by Angelique Ashton Designs"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/202217/pictures/full/20120404142102-DSC00220.jpg?1333574486"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p align=""left"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">You get the general idea. It seems that to have a snowball's chance at getting a traditional small business loan these days (or even interest from many Angel Investors) that I need to plan to have about 20% of what I ultimately need to borrow of my own “skin in the game.” In setting the final goal amount for this campaign I thought about setting the goal at $75,000, which is what my estimates project I'll need to actually get doors open, but I decided to keep it realistic and shoot for just enough to get me to the next step – the bank loan. After the bank loan is obtained, funds raised through this campaign can then go towards initial space build out (such as construction of the runway) and equipment, inventory, décor and advertising.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"">If by chance the unthinkable should happen and I meet my funding goal here but then fail to secure a loan to be able to actually get the store open, or I don't come anywhere near my goal, the journey will not end there.

The campaign has taken a fabulous new direction! As we enter the final days we are proud to announce that any further funds recieved through this campaign will be utilized in the production of a fantastic fundraiser fashion show and auction on June 28th in Seattle! The show, entitled BeDecked! will bring together Artists and Designers from around the Northwest and help springboard us to our final goal both in recognition and finances. Your support is greatly appreciated, especially if you are unable to make it to the show on the 28th! Thanks again for supporting Lime Light Fashion!

 
 

The Story/The Vision
Thank you for taking the time to check out my campaign!

Lime Light Fashion is currently a teeny tiny one-woman web based business providing hard to find stage jewelry, one of a kind super-glam clothing items, specialized costume accessories and custom costuming services to the stage performer, pageant community and women of all ages for special occasions. The goal of my project is to raise money to open a costume, gown and accessories warehouse superstore/fashion show & music venue in Seattle. Let me share a little bit about the overall vision:
Lime Light Fashion Playland will be a true destination shopping experience. We'll carry Angelique Ashton Designs of course, as well as the cutting edge designs of a couple fellow designers I already have lined up, pageant and stage jewelry, specialized performance needs such as belly dance accessories, rodeo/western wear, burlesque and ballroom costumes, corsets, hats, tu-tus, feather boas, heels and evening gowns . . . but the main attraction will be that the store has a runway and a full stage for live shows. It will be a boutique by day where ladies can pick up anything their heart desires for a costume or performance, and will be encouraged to step out of the dressing room onto the runway to work it – then by night the place will transform into the city's premier fashion venue, hosting fashion shows, bachelorette parties, and musical acts. On a regular basis, the store will host Lime Light events to showcase local talent and provide fashion students and new designers opportunities to have their work seen. 
It will be a world unto itself, a parallel universe where a girl can still play dress up, no matter her age. It will be a safe place, where people are free to express who they are and have fun with it. Our multifaceted mission will be to spread glitter all over the community, promote self-esteem in teens and young women, promote safe and natural cosmetics and support the local Artist and fashion community. It will be the shimmery ethereal magical princess wonderland from inside my head, on the outside of my head. We will have champagne and cupcakes and live unicorns. I thought about cotton candy, but honestly, I'm not sure I want people with sticky fingers handling everything and petting my unicorns. I mean, they aren't self-bathing like cats . . .


What We Need & What You Get
You get the general idea. It seems that to have a snowball's chance at getting a traditional small business loan these days (or even interest from many Angel Investors) that I need to plan to have about 20% of what I ultimately need to borrow of my own “skin in the game.” In setting the final goal amount for this campaign I thought about setting the goal at $75,000, which is what my estimates project I'll need to actually get doors open, but I decided to keep it realistic and shoot for just enough to get me to the next step – the bank loan. After the bank loan is obtained, funds raised through this campaign can then go towards initial space build out (such as construction of the runway) and equipment, inventory, décor and advertising.
If by chance the unthinkable should happen and I meet my funding goal here but then fail to secure a loan to be able to actually get the store open, or I don't come anywhere near my goal, the journey will not end there. Plan B is to use whatever is raised here to bolster Lime Light Fashion's internet business by investing in a professional re-design, additional inventory and some advertising including producing lines for a couple more fashion shows in the coming year. After another year of running a successful web business and showing my work in larger and more professional arenas, I would then try again to get the loan to open the physical store. So, it may be a long road ahead, but I have faith that it eventually ends up at the same place no matter how far or arduous the journey. 
The Impact

 Any contribution no matter how big or small helps and will be forever appreciated! The rewards offered for supporters will also be honored regardless of how long it takes me to get the store open. The last thing on earth I want to do is disappoint anyone who supported me along the way in this. Please consider contributing to my campaign if you would like to one day come and walk the runway and party with us at Lime Light Fashion Playland! Thank you.

<p></p>One day my girlfriend's phone was stolen from her backpack in urban place (not sure why she put the phone in the backpack). She was very upset(mainly is because the photo inside) and ask me if I can find some way to prevent it happen again (first come to my mind is don't put it in the backpack again, but it seem not good for her).  Then she come up with few rules I should include in the solution that I need to come up.</span><div>

Recently, I won RAW: Natural Born Artist's  Designer of the Year Award!!  Sadly, we live fairly close to the edge here at Corvus + Crux so getting out to the awards show out in LA is a bit of a stretch for everyone here. <br/><br/>What I'm trying to do is to be able to raise enough money for me and an assistant to get out to LA for  a few days for the event and a couple of meetings.  I need to be able to cover air fare, hotel, and food.  <br/><br/>The number that we came up with is 1,900 for 6 nights +  travel.<br/><ul>
<li> Two days of prep for the collection ( fittings, alterations, pressing / steaming )</li>
<li>Saturday RAW: Natural Born Artists has all of the winners doing interviews ect</li>
<li>Sunday! Awards Show!</li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/>CORVUS 十 CRUX is the rebirth of American born designer Alex London. Based out of NYC, CORVUS 十 CRUX possesses a deep need to to capture the images seen in the darkest and most beautiful parts of the human mind. To that end, the label uses less than conventional techniques to achieve each vision. Our lead designer, Alex London began designing formally at the F.I.T Pre-college program at fifteen. Alex attended Parsons and held various internships before a chance encounter with another designer allowed a mentor-ship that created the foundation, skills, and drive for Alex to pursue a solo career. In the fall of 2010, Alex officially created the signature label ""ALEX LONDON."" However, after several years of business Alex was no longer affiliated with the original label. In the spring of 2013 the designer was tempted to move on under a new brand. CORVUS 十 CRUX is the product of this renewal in life and in art, with the staples of collections that evoke the dark, dramatic, and ethereal, drawing inspiration from worlds of another time and of another fantasy. Long flowing gowns and high collars evoke a sense of the grandeur, while low necklines, low backs, and beautiful fits accentuate the beauty of the feminine form. Each piece is sculpted with unconventional techniques and individual care to play with the strengths of each fabric.<br/><br/>Publications include Vogue Taiwan, a Vogue gallery exhibition, Harper's Bazaar Vietnam, ELLE Vietnam, Hunger Magazine, Twelve, Adon, Factice, Kurv, Jimon, and Z!NK Magazine March cover featuring Taylor Momsen. CORVUS 十 CRUX pieces have been worn by many celebrities that include Carmen Dell'Orefice, Anne Hathaway, Taylor Swift, Pamela Anderson, Kat Deluna, Raja Gemini, and Amanda Palmer. CORVUS 十 CRUX 's first pret-a-porter collection ""Blood Red, Sister Rose"" was released exclusively in Japan via Monoco. CORVUS 十 CRUX made a surprise appearance in the most recent campaign for Canon Japan with makeup artist Yuko Takahashi as well as an advertorial campaign with Lexus. <br/><br/>Recently, Taylor Momsen has recently worn several pieces for her new music video for her highly anticipated new single "" Going to Hell "". We were thrilled to get the chance to work with her again and hope to make this a long lasting relationship.<br/>Taylor's single released 9/19/2013<br/><br/>CORVUS 十 CRUX would love to hear from you!

</blockquote></div>","Hi! My name is Alex London 'm a fashion designer based out of NYC and the owner and lead designer of Corvus + Crux. Recently, I won RAW: Natural Born Artist's  Designer of the Year Award!!  Sadly, we live fairly close to the edge here at Corvus + Crux so getting out to the awards show out in LA is a bit of a stretch for everyone here. What I'm trying to do is to be able to raise enough money for me and an assistant to get out to LA for  a few days for the event and a couple of meetings.  I need to be able to cover air fare, hotel, and food.  The number that we came up with is 1,900 for 6 nights +  travel.
 Two days of prep for the collection ( fittings, alterations, pressing / steaming )
Saturday RAW: Natural Born Artists has all of the winners doing interviews ect
Sunday! Awards Show!
Monday / Tuesday are our Meetings Days!   

Through the magic of Kayak.com I've been able to find some REALLY cheap flights but I need to book this soon before the rates go up.  So help if you can this will be a really cool experience for everyone involved and I hope to have this be a kickass show!

CORVUS 十 CRUX

CORVUS 十 CRUX is the rebirth of American born designer Alex London. Based out of NYC, CORVUS 十 CRUX possesses a deep need to to capture the images seen in the darkest and most beautiful parts of the human mind. To that end, the label uses less than conventional techniques to achieve each vision. Our lead designer, Alex London began designing formally at the F.I.T Pre-college program at fifteen. Alex attended Parsons and held various internships before a chance encounter with another designer allowed a mentor-ship that created the foundation, skills, and drive for Alex to pursue a solo career. In the fall of 2010, Alex officially created the signature label ""ALEX LONDON."" However, after several years of business Alex was no longer affiliated with the original label. In the spring of 2013 the designer was tempted to move on under a new brand. CORVUS 十 CRUX is the product of this renewal in life and in art, with the staples of collections that evoke the dark, dramatic, and ethereal, drawing inspiration from worlds of another time and of another fantasy. Long flowing gowns and high collars evoke a sense of the grandeur, while low necklines, low backs, and beautiful fits accentuate the beauty of the feminine form. Each piece is sculpted with unconventional techniques and individual care to play with the strengths of each fabric.Publications include Vogue Taiwan, a Vogue gallery exhibition, Harper's Bazaar Vietnam, ELLE Vietnam, Hunger Magazine, Twelve, Adon, Factice, Kurv, Jimon, and Z!NK Magazine March cover featuring Taylor Momsen. CORVUS 十 CRUX pieces have been worn by many celebrities that include Carmen Dell'Orefice, Anne Hathaway, Taylor Swift, Pamela Anderson, Kat Deluna, Raja Gemini, and Amanda Palmer. CORVUS 十 CRUX 's first pret-a-porter collection ""Blood Red, Sister Rose"" was released exclusively in Japan via Monoco. CORVUS 十 CRUX made a surprise appearance in the most recent campaign for Canon Japan with makeup artist Yuko Takahashi as well as an advertorial campaign with Lexus. Recently, Taylor Momsen has recently worn several pieces for her new music video for her highly anticipated new single "" Going to Hell "". We were thrilled to get the chance to work with her again and hope to make this a long lasting relationship.Taylor's single released 9/19/2013CORVUS 十 CRUX would love to hear from you!

<p><span>We started this journey out of a passion for prototyping and purchased a couple lower-end printers for “beginners” to bring our ideas to life. The printers were fairly easy to set up, but the print quality was poor and the interface simplistic, but not easy. Then we bought a couple of the high-end machines - and when perfectly set up, they print well. But the set-up took way more time than we had expected - it was too technical and the interface too convoluted. And then there was the cost… </span></p>
<p> </p>So we had to ask: why aren’t there any mid-range printers that are affordable, easy-to-use, and have excellent print-quality? This is why we created NEA - an elegant, modular, and upgradeable 3D Printer that is made to last...and is not a $200 gimmick. <br/><br/><b>A <i>True</i> Desktop Printer. </b><p><br/> </p>

Maintaining a standard of quality can only be achieved by acquiring and designing the most precise components with the entire printer in mind.  We use a combination of small incremental stepper motors with custom slider blocks to handle all axis of movement; combined with our rigid build quality and Vibration Dampening Tech® and you get world class prints!</span></span></span></p>

<p><span>NEA is super space-conservative with the best footprint-to-build-volume ratio in each class. Print more, take up less desk space. The only place we cut corners is the corners. Don't be square!</span><br/> </p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><span>NEA is so space efficient because of our ""gantry"" or ""print axis mechanics"".  Most printers waste a lot of space by moving their print heads up, down and around an immobile print bed. NEA is different because our print bed actually moves back and forth on the Y axis, while the print head moves left and right as it climbs upwards on the Z axis. This means there is no wasted space around the outside of the print bed. Our design is the only cylindrical shaped FFF 3D printer on the market - which just happens to look pretty awesome!</span></span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span>Ever heard the saying ""Round is Sound""? Compared to conventional box shaped printers that keep the vibrations inside the printer, NEA's cylindrical metal uni-body has no weak spots and reduces pesky vibrations by dissipating in an outward direction.  As a result you will gain far greater longevity on your printer components.</span></p>

The tip melts the filament and brings your creations to life!</span></span></p>
<div>
<b>Drop &amp; Lock Shelf </b>- <span>No, this is not a dance move. It’s a shelf that holds the motor that slides the Extruder Head along the X-axis, AND, at the same time, moving itself up and down along the Y-axis and controlling the Cool Spool elevator. </span><p> </p>
<p><b>Core Drawer</b> - <span>When NEA is powered down the Core Drawer allows you to view, clean, maintain and even upgrade the electronic components in a snap. Think of it like a fully removable sock drawer full of robot brains. Not to mention the PRO and PRO+ models come with a robust 450 watt. A power supply this stable can power NEA with ease, and run future upgrades that require more juice.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Cool Spool</b> - We love this!  The Cool Spool is our custom designed filament cartridge.  It wrangles the filament to remove potential twisting and breakage.  The best part about the Cool Spool is that it automatically lifts, allowing for the additional 2 inches in the Z-axis once the Drop &amp; Lock Shelf reaches it’s vertical limit.</span></p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our Goal is to make 3D printing more accessible and friendly.  That's why NEA is a high performance machine for all experience levels. Key features like <b>Self-Leveling Bed, Open Source software</b> and <b>Non-proprietary filament</b> means NEA is easy to set up the way you want it.</span></p>
<p><b>Self-Leveling Bed </b>- Manually leveling a print bed can be a real pain. Not only is it often a complicated and time consuming process, but, if done wrong, will have compounding negative effects on your prints. NEA automatically self-levels<b> every time</b> you print. It can't get any easier!</p>
<p><b>Open Source software</b> - <span>Software for a 3D printer is kind of like an operating system for your phone or computer. If you are used to a specific one, its hard to use others. This is why we made NEA compatible with most 3rd party and open source software applications.</span></p>
<p><b>Non-proprietary filament</b> - <span>NEA 3D filament is a high grade PLA and offered at an awesome price. We've carefully selected high quality filaments which work especially well with NEA printers. But feel free to use other brands’ 1.75mm filaments with NEA (and use our filament with other printers too!).  We have filaments ranging from  basic PLA and ABS plastics, to Nylon, Carbon Fibre and metalized plastic hybrids.  NEA will be offering upgrades to higher temperature hot ends to facilitate the use of the more exotic filaments.</span></p>

</tbody></table><div> </div></div>","We are committed to building a new experience for makers, innovators, builders and designers. 
 
 
 
We started this journey out of a passion for prototyping and purchased a couple lower-end printers for “beginners” to bring our ideas to life. The printers were fairly easy to set up, but the print quality was poor and the interface simplistic, but not easy. Then we bought a couple of the high-end machines - and when perfectly set up, they print well. But the set-up took way more time than we had expected - it was too technical and the interface too convoluted. And then there was the cost… 
 So we had to ask: why aren’t there any mid-range printers that are affordable, easy-to-use, and have excellent print-quality? This is why we created NEA - an elegant, modular, and upgradeable 3D Printer that is made to last...and is not a $200 gimmick. A True Desktop Printer.  
 
 
 

 

 
 

 

 
 
 

Still can't decide? This video will help!
 
 
*all printers come with a free 1lb spool of filament! 

 
NEA uses a technology called ""Fused Filament Fabrication"" or ""FFF"". This may be compared to a super small glue gun that carefully pushes or ""extrudes"" melted filament made of plastics, like PLA or ABS, out the hot end. The plastic is printed layer-by-layer in predefined cross sections which cool and harden almost instantly. 
 
 With each iteration of our prototype stages, NEA 3D printers have improved overall print quality.  Early on, we were excited just to get something printed, but since then our focus has been on reaching the perfect balance between accuracy, speed, reliability and repeatability. Maintaining a standard of quality can only be achieved by acquiring and designing the most precise components with the entire printer in mind.  We use a combination of small incremental stepper motors with custom slider blocks to handle all axis of movement; combined with our rigid build quality and Vibration Dampening Tech® and you get world class prints!
 
 
 

  
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 
 

 

NEA is super space-conservative with the best footprint-to-build-volume ratio in each class. Print more, take up less desk space. The only place we cut corners is the corners. Don't be square! 
 
NEA is so space efficient because of our ""gantry"" or ""print axis mechanics"".  Most printers waste a lot of space by moving their print heads up, down and around an immobile print bed. NEA is different because our print bed actually moves back and forth on the Y axis, while the print head moves left and right as it climbs upwards on the Z axis. This means there is no wasted space around the outside of the print bed. Our design is the only cylindrical shaped FFF 3D printer on the market - which just happens to look pretty awesome!
 

 
Ever heard the saying ""Round is Sound""? Compared to conventional box shaped printers that keep the vibrations inside the printer, NEA's cylindrical metal uni-body has no weak spots and reduces pesky vibrations by dissipating in an outward direction.  As a result you will gain far greater longevity on your printer components.
 
 

 
 3D printing is evolving very quickly. That's why we made NEA modular. Future upgrades and maintenance are done in a snap. We have a ton of cool upgrades coming - like multi-color, multi-head, and even full colour printing.  Expect us to tackle higher print speeds and multi-mediums as well.  Gone are the days of buying a brand new printer every time a new feature comes along.  Your investment in NEA won’t leave you behind! 
  
NEA's Extruder Head, Drop & Lock Shelf and Core Drawer are removable - without tools! This is very important if you plan on keeping your printer for more than a year. If any mechanical or electrical component on your NEA were to break or malfunction, just pop it off and send it back.  As soon as you receive your replacement module, snap it right back on and away you go. No need to return the entire printer and wait and wait and…...

 
 
 
 Extruder Head - This is where the magic happens: it contains the gears that push the filament into the hot end. The tip melts the filament and brings your creations to life!

Drop & Lock Shelf - No, this is not a dance move. It’s a shelf that holds the motor that slides the Extruder Head along the X-axis, AND, at the same time, moving itself up and down along the Y-axis and controlling the Cool Spool elevator.  
Core Drawer - When NEA is powered down the Core Drawer allows you to view, clean, maintain and even upgrade the electronic components in a snap. Think of it like a fully removable sock drawer full of robot brains. Not to mention the PRO and PRO+ models come with a robust 450 watt. A power supply this stable can power NEA with ease, and run future upgrades that require more juice.
Cool Spool - We love this!  The Cool Spool is our custom designed filament cartridge.  It wrangles the filament to remove potential twisting and breakage.  The best part about the Cool Spool is that it automatically lifts, allowing for the additional 2 inches in the Z-axis once the Drop & Lock Shelf reaches it’s vertical limit.

Our Goal is to make 3D printing more accessible and friendly.  That's why NEA is a high performance machine for all experience levels. Key features like Self-Leveling Bed, Open Source software and Non-proprietary filament means NEA is easy to set up the way you want it.
Self-Leveling Bed - Manually leveling a print bed can be a real pain. Not only is it often a complicated and time consuming process, but, if done wrong, will have compounding negative effects on your prints. NEA automatically self-levels every time you print. It can't get any easier!
Open Source software - Software for a 3D printer is kind of like an operating system for your phone or computer. If you are used to a specific one, its hard to use others. This is why we made NEA compatible with most 3rd party and open source software applications.
Non-proprietary filament - NEA 3D filament is a high grade PLA and offered at an awesome price. We've carefully selected high quality filaments which work especially well with NEA printers. But feel free to use other brands’ 1.75mm filaments with NEA (and use our filament with other printers too!).  We have filaments ranging from  basic PLA and ABS plastics, to Nylon, Carbon Fibre and metalized plastic hybrids.  NEA will be offering upgrades to higher temperature hot ends to facilitate the use of the more exotic filaments.
 

 
Out of the box NEA is ready to go! Simply plug it in, follow the simple instructions and you will be printing in minutes -it’s that easy. Our goal is to make the best experience possible. That’s why NEA's software comes with video tutorials to guide you every step of the way. 
 




SOFTWARE

Software is the key to creating successful 3D prints. It takes years and countless revisions to create ""usable"" software, but we wanted NEA's software to be fantastic right out of the box. So we teamed up with one of the best names is 3D printing software, Repetier. Their extremely refined software has been in development for years and has features like no other. NEA will come ready to print with a customized version -  specific to your model, so no setup will be required.
 

 
 
Here are some of the many features offered with the NEA Repetier software.
 
 

Easy and intuitive to Learn.
Multi-extruder Support for future innovations. *Hint Hint
NEA added self-levelling
Supports several slicers for best printing results.
Preview resulting print with selectable layer ranges.
Live preview of printer action and temperature curves.
Send push messages on status changes using phone app.
Windows, Linux or Mac OS X compatible.
Integrated NEA Specific Tutorials and Help + UI upgrades
Slice with CuraEngine or Slic3r.
Alternatively integrates Skeinforge as second slicer.
STL composer - place, rotate and scale your STL files on your print bed and store or slice it.

 
There are so many great features here, but if you are more comfortable with other open source or 3rd party software packages, NEA 3D printers are willing and able!  Below is a list of known of compatible software packages that will work with your NEA printer.

  After our reveal at CES in Las Vegas last January, NEA's campaign was set to launch in early February 2015. However, an amazing week at the show with industry reps and makers from the global community made us realize NEA still needed some improvements. We are not going to be a perpetual-start up company with a one-off product. We want to make an experience that will revolutionize the 3D world.       Refer a friend to purchase a printer and reap the rewards! Get up to 3 rolls of filament to share with friends!For more information on how it all works check out the updates page.    
 
 
 
 

 
 
NEA would not have been possible without the help and support we've received along our journey. We are incredibly grateful for all the advice, guidance and kind words. Here is just a small list in no particular order.Thank you so much!
 
 
 

 
 
 
With any crowd funded campaign there are risks to us as a company, but no more than the risk that you take by supporting us.  While we are proud of our 3D Printer and believe you will love it,  this is simply just the very beginning of our journey.
We have invested our time, resources and passion into turning this dream into a collective reality. And with your support, the possibilities for future innovations are already in the works. Our diverse team has been in the creative services and technology industries for years - and we know how to deliver.NEA will be no different. NEA will deliver.

</div></div>","UPDATE NEWS: NOW WE ARE READY FOR SHIPPING!  Get Mo.80 Before Christmas (Limited Number Available). Mo.Story We strive to make the best wallets on the market. Thus, we started [Mo.], the brand with the [Minimal Object] and clean look, but [Maximum Observation] in terms of functionality, usage, and design.With many trials and errors, we developed Mo. signature card slot which proven to be the fastest for all card access. As a result, “80” is a combination of “8” cards that our signature card slot can hold on the left and “0” on the right. This is our fun fact figure that we will use in coming collections.     In early 2015, my sister and I were looking for a wallet that is both stylish and functional. We wanted to be able to store about 10 cards and have easy access to them. We searched high and low, across international waters, but didn’t come across any that met our needs! Most of crowdfunding wallets are short wallets for men. Where are the alternatives for stylish, long wallets for women? So, we decided to make our own wallet that reflects a minimalist, yet sophisticated style. We hope others will enjoy the quality of our wallets and love the design as much as we do.  Delivering a quality wallet to you is our happiness. We hope you can feel the difference with Mo.80 wallet design. Please support us and help us spread the words. With your help, we look forward to see Mo.80 in production soon!    What makes Mo.80 better?Mo.80 wallet is an original unisex wallet that designed for functional usage and unique style. We also emphasize on the quality of materials and craftsmanship, so you can be assured that you will receive a high quality wallet at an honest price. Quality We sought out the tannery that can work with our Japanese minimalist style leather (inspired by Japanese durable schoolbag leather), and also highly experienced with Italian tanning technique that gives the consistent color throughout with the exact match of our selected city pantone. We're also working with a professional manufacturer who have been working for many global brands that has decades of experience. So craftsmanship is guaranteed.Convenience
 
 

The patent-pending Mo.80 signature card slot gives you the most ergonomic way to use wallet. You can easily take cards out and put them back within a second. Cards & cash are distinctively separated on the left and the right side of the wallet. No need to figure out which side of wallet you put your needed card last time. Design    The wallet is uniquely designed for both women and men to enjoy. Mo.80 is inspired by the lifestyle of urban light travellers who are looking for both functional products as well as style. This minimal style with an edge wallet is an everyday item that gives confidence and self-expression to the users. Good News! We are very excited to announce that Mo.80 has passed to the final round of Good Design Award from Japan Institute of Design Promotion.

18.4 cm × 9.7 cm × 2.3 cm (L × W × H)(shorter than other long wallets to fit most small bags)
Materials
Genuine chrome-tanned leather, Korean tight lining, Magnet, YKK Excella Zippers.

The leather is water resistant treated to suit your everyday life. Small water spill is ok. Leather still has its pore, so it's not fully waterproof. Try to avoid heavy rain.
The beauty of leather is a patina, a soft sheen that develops on the surface of the leather. The more you use, the leather will become softer and give you greater tactile experience as it ages.

Finishing: Smooth acrylic color edging to give the sophisticated stylish look.

<h1><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The start of a Legacy</span></h1> <p>35 years ago Jim Thornton took the maple coffee table out of his living room in Boulder, Colorado and turned it into one of the first downhill longboard prototypes of its kind. He knew even then that this style of skateboarding would become an exciting new way for people to express themselves all across the world. Never satisfied, Jim would continue to tinker and improve upon his designs for many years.</p>
<p>Since 2010 Jim, inspired by his son Tony and the new generation of riders, has assembled the resources and put together a team of engineers, designers, woodworkers, and of course, skaters to take their obsession with longboard building as far as possible. Years of work have led to the development of a longboard of unsurpassed quality and beauty: The Legacy38</p>
<p>Now, Latitude Longboards uses the most advanced technology and highest quality hardwoods to hand craft unique and highly functional works of art. Through this campaign you can directly help change the way we design and build longboards forever.</p>
<p>The beauty of our process is its ability to be modified to fit an individual rider's needs. <b>Our ultimate goal is to develop a never-before-seen interface, which will enable our customers to design and build their very own custom boards.</b> At Latitude we know that every rider has different preferences and riding styles. Why should you buy another cookie-cutter laminate deck, when you can get a longboard unlike any other?</p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Latitude Longboards is a group of passionate riders and woodworkers who care about the impact they have on the world around them. That's why we have partnered with Halfmoon Works, a local woodshop in Halfmoon, New York, who make high-quality wood products and whose programs create a livelihood for people with special needs. (Learn more at <a href=""http://www.halfmoonworks.com%29/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.halfmoonworks.com)</a>. This means that by supporting our campaign you are not only contributing to innovation in the sport of longboarding, but every deck you purchase directly helps someone with special needs get professional training for employment.</p>
<p>We have spent years pouring our hearts into this project, and will stop at nothing to take it to the next level. As a team we have developed a totally new production process with results that speak for themselves. Contribute to this campaign to support innovation in longboarding and become a part of something good.</p>

</div> <div> <h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2> <p> At this point, we are getting pretty good at measuring the risks and tackling the challenges in producing a new type of longboard.</p>
<p>No one board can be perfect for all situations, so we have chosen to launch this first high-performance model to show the capabilities of this technology, and hope that those with different preferences will help us collaborate on future models and features. The Legacy38 is just a start for Latitude Longboards.</p>
<p>Any undertaking of this scale is bound to come across challenges, but with the experienced team we have as well as great resources such as Northeastern University's IDEA Accelerator behind us, we are particularly suited to deliver on our goals.</p>

<div>When you mount the trucks of a longboard at various wheelbases, the size of your turning radius changes. Changing the turning radius of the board can greatly impact the feel of the ride, so you should think about your riding style before choosing between the 24'', 26.5'', and 29'' mounting options.  As a rule, the shorter your wheelbase, the tighter your turns can be. Conversely a longer wheelbase will trade tight turns for stability at higher speeds. If you are looking to carve out some nice slalom turns, go with 24''. If you plan to go really fast, think about mounting at 29''. For the perfect balance of stability and control, 26.5'' is for you.

<li><b>What is Latitude Longboards about?</b></li>
</ul>
<div>Latitude Longboards is a father-son longboard startup based in Burnt Hills, New York. Together Jim and Tony Thornton spent three years perfecting the Legacy model, which launched in November, 2014. Made from the highest quality materials and the most advanced production techniques, Latitude Longboards is committed to making innovative and high-performing rolling works of art. We try to always work with local craftsmen, and produce 100% in the USA. Like most longboarders, we care about connecting with, and positively influencing our community. That's why the seven-person Latitude Team has turned to Indiegogo to finance the first production run of the Legacy model, and to garner as much feedback as possible from the international longboarding family.<br/>
</div>
</div>
</div></div>","The start of a Legacy 35 years ago Jim Thornton took the maple coffee table out of his living room in Boulder, Colorado and turned it into one of the first downhill longboard prototypes of its kind. He knew even then that this style of skateboarding would become an exciting new way for people to express themselves all across the world. Never satisfied, Jim would continue to tinker and improve upon his designs for many years.
Since 2010 Jim, inspired by his son Tony and the new generation of riders, has assembled the resources and put together a team of engineers, designers, woodworkers, and of course, skaters to take their obsession with longboard building as far as possible. Years of work have led to the development of a longboard of unsurpassed quality and beauty: The Legacy38
Now, Latitude Longboards uses the most advanced technology and highest quality hardwoods to hand craft unique and highly functional works of art. Through this campaign you can directly help change the way we design and build longboards forever.
The beauty of our process is its ability to be modified to fit an individual rider's needs. Our ultimate goal is to develop a never-before-seen interface, which will enable our customers to design and build their very own custom boards. At Latitude we know that every rider has different preferences and riding styles. Why should you buy another cookie-cutter laminate deck, when you can get a longboard unlike any other?


Our Process


The Legacy38 Overview











Our decks are offered with the worlds best components. Completes come with Bear 852 Trucks and Hawgs Wheels, so your Legacy38 can be ready to ride right out of the box.
   What We Need & What You Get In order to fund production and distribution of these gorgeous boards, we will raise $10,000. Our goals for this campaign are quite simple: 25 Limited Edition Legacy38s
We will fund production of the initial batch of 25 limited edition Legacy38s. This will be the main reward for this campaign, and will go fast at an early-bird price of $425!

200 Legacy38s 
After the first 25, we will be offering an additional 200 decks for $475 or a complete setup with Bear Trucks and Hawgs Wheels for $600 (a $150 value for only $125).

Additional Perks and Stretch Goals
Revenues from additional perks such as the My Latitude Experience with Team Rider Dylan Walsh, Thank-Yous, T-Shirts, Hoodies, and Beanies will all cover additional startup costs and enable other exciting stretch goals, such as development of an interface for deck customization directly on LatitudeLongboards.com!







  The Impact Latitude Longboards is a group of passionate riders and woodworkers who care about the impact they have on the world around them. That's why we have partnered with Halfmoon Works, a local woodshop in Halfmoon, New York, who make high-quality wood products and whose programs create a livelihood for people with special needs. (Learn more at www.halfmoonworks.com). This means that by supporting our campaign you are not only contributing to innovation in the sport of longboarding, but every deck you purchase directly helps someone with special needs get professional training for employment.
We have spent years pouring our hearts into this project, and will stop at nothing to take it to the next level. As a team we have developed a totally new production process with results that speak for themselves. Contribute to this campaign to support innovation in longboarding and become a part of something good.

  Risks & Challenges  At this point, we are getting pretty good at measuring the risks and tackling the challenges in producing a new type of longboard.
No one board can be perfect for all situations, so we have chosen to launch this first high-performance model to show the capabilities of this technology, and hope that those with different preferences will help us collaborate on future models and features. The Legacy38 is just a start for Latitude Longboards.
Any undertaking of this scale is bound to come across challenges, but with the experienced team we have as well as great resources such as Northeastern University's IDEA Accelerator behind us, we are particularly suited to deliver on our goals.

Shipping a package of this size internationally can become prohibitively expensive. Therefore we must unfortunately ask that supporters outside the US cover the cost of shipping the deck or complete. Please shoot us an email at info@latitudelongboards.com if you would like help estimating your shipping costs internationally.


Where do I enter my T-Shirt/Hoodie size, grip tape choice, or wheelbase preference?

<p></p></span></span></span><p>We're a movement that believes good is a cycle, and most companies only go half circle.
We want to source goods that are ethically sound, produced with minimal
environmental impact, and that help local economies. In turn, we want to donate
part of the proceeds from these goods to smaller and local organizations trying
to create change. We believe that by taking time to find small organizations
looking to create change, partnering with them to help them achieve their
goal, and creating a community of individuals powered by doing good, we can
change the world. We want you to be able to submit local organizations creating
change, and we want to connect you with the impact your support had on the
organizations later.</p>
<p>Our model
has three parts:</p>
<p>1.)<span>  </span>Find great, ethically produced, items from
small businesses around the world. By supporting small businesses in developing
parts of the world we can boost those economies, create jobs, and help lift
citizens out of poverty.</p>
<p>2.)<span>  </span>Give back with every purchase. We’re not
going to just market our goods with a charity. We’re going to search to find
the real change-makers, wherever they may be, and make sure they have the
funding they need to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>3.)<span>  </span>Create a community. We don’t want to just
sell products; we want to create connections. We want the organizations we
support to be able to tell you their story, and we want you to know the impact
the money we raised had on their organization. We want to hear about the
change-makers you know, and what we can do to help them out.</p>

</p>
<p>Every
day, 27 non-profit organizations go out of business while .0083% of
non-profits receive 1/8th of private donations. 100 non-profits get 1/8th of
the pie, while the other 1.2 million split the rest, and the funding per
organization gets minuscule as the list goes down. This is largely
driven by the notoriety given to certain organizations through
partnerships with powerful brands, while small, local, innovative groups
struggle to find the funding to push forward. </p>
<p>We’re
sick of it. Many of these powerful brands use unethical labor practices, cause
extreme environmental harm, and even sell toxic products while hiding under the
their charitable partnerships. </p>
<p>We
don’t think it’s okay to say you want to help poverty while doing nothing to increase
economic activity if you have the resources. Letting someone use their skills
to earn a fair wage is a much more effective way to break the cycle of poverty.</p>
<p>We
don’t think it’s okay to overprice poorly made products in the name of
bettering the world while barely donating to the cause.</p>
<p>We
don’t think it’s okay to sell products with carcinogens while supporting cancer
awareness.</p>
<p>We
do believe that every action can be for good, and that’s the principle we’ve
built our supply chain around.</p>

We've set up connections with local artisans and groups in several different cities, and we're ready to move forward with completing our supply chain. We just need funding to get there. </p>

By teaching girls a skill they can use to support themselves, and using the money to keep them in school, they're empowering women to break the cycle of poverty. Importing products from Liberia is complicated and costly though, and we don't have the funding to do this without your help!</p>

<p>We wanted to create something special for our backers, so this design will only be available during our campaign. The first 50 backers will be able to receive it in t-shirt form for only $25, along with everything included in our change-maker package, AND you will receive it in time for the holidays! After the first 50 have been claimed, you will still be able to get the design by specifying it in the dreamer package, but they won't ship out until January. </p>
<p>Every $500 we raise will unlock a new design choice, and we will e-mail you a survey at the end of the campaign to let you choose! Designs that have already been unlocked are available in the gallery. Sizes available are XS-XL.</p>
<p>Creating change is important to us, so even during the campaign $5 from every pledge that purchases a product will go our featured organizations, which you can readabout below.</p>
<p>*International shipping is available, just add $30!</p>
<h4>Manufacturing</h4>
<p>We want our impact on the world to be positive. All our perk items use low-impact dyes. This means they do not contain heavy metals or toxic substances, nor are they petro-chemically based. The absorption (or fixation) rate for these dyes averages 75%, which means less dye is used to produce our colors and less water is used to rinse them in the process. For fabrics, we use innovative eco-friendly offerings, knitting organic cotton with recycled polyester and rayon to create an incredibly comfortable product.</p>
<p>The ink we print with is free of most environmentally damaging chemicals such as PVC, phthalate, heavy metals, azo compounds, nonylphenol and formaldehyde. We screen print every shirt by hand, which gives them a unique feel, and keeps us from having electrical equipment running constantly.</p>

<p>Kitechild is transforming the quality of care for orphan and vulnerable children through sustainable micro-projects. Once co-founder <strong>Jacqueline Herrera </strong>was able to see first hand how these children lived and meet them and see that they are wonderful, normal children who love to sing, play, dance just like every other child, she knew that the world needed to know about them and stop seeing orphans as hopeless causes. They are children full of potential and if we do not help them, they will continue the cycles of poverty, abuse, and violence that often led them to live in orphanages in the first place.</p>
<p>Our model is project based, which means we partner with select orphanages and assess the children's living conditions and see where there is a need. Needs include food security, quality of nutrition, access to education, and appropriate caregivers. Examples of projects to address these needs are chicken coops, greenhouses, fish farms, solar panel installation, etc. All projects are sustainable and have a direct impact on each child's quality of life. The projects also help the homes become less dependent on foreign aid, and they are able to devote more time to caring for each child. </p>
<p>The money we're raising will help with four projects they have on deck. One is solar panels in Liberia that will save the home $450 per month they currently spend on generator fuel. The money saved will allow the home to feed the children three times a day as opposed to two. Other projects coming up are a school at an orphanage in India, a chicken farm in India, and clean water access in Kenya. They also need funding to cover administrative costs such as paying our liaisons who monitor each project in the field.    </p>

Members of the Bosh Bosh Project, an organization that teaches girls sewing skills and uses their products to fund their school tuition. We want to carry these products in the U.S.! 


We're a movement that believes good is a cycle, and most companies only go half circle.
We want to source goods that are ethically sound, produced with minimal
environmental impact, and that help local economies. In turn, we want to donate
part of the proceeds from these goods to smaller and local organizations trying
to create change. We believe that by taking time to find small organizations
looking to create change, partnering with them to help them achieve their
goal, and creating a community of individuals powered by doing good, we can
change the world. We want you to be able to submit local organizations creating
change, and we want to connect you with the impact your support had on the
organizations later.
Our model
has three parts:
1.)  Find great, ethically produced, items from
small businesses around the world. By supporting small businesses in developing
parts of the world we can boost those economies, create jobs, and help lift
citizens out of poverty.
2.)  Give back with every purchase. We’re not
going to just market our goods with a charity. We’re going to search to find
the real change-makers, wherever they may be, and make sure they have the
funding they need to make the world a better place.
3.)  Create a community. We don’t want to just
sell products; we want to create connections. We want the organizations we
support to be able to tell you their story, and we want you to know the impact
the money we raised had on their organization. We want to hear about the
change-makers you know, and what we can do to help them out.









Every
day, 27 non-profit organizations go out of business while .0083% of
non-profits receive 1/8th of private donations. 100 non-profits get 1/8th of
the pie, while the other 1.2 million split the rest, and the funding per
organization gets minuscule as the list goes down. This is largely
driven by the notoriety given to certain organizations through
partnerships with powerful brands, while small, local, innovative groups
struggle to find the funding to push forward. 
We’re
sick of it. Many of these powerful brands use unethical labor practices, cause
extreme environmental harm, and even sell toxic products while hiding under the
their charitable partnerships. 
We
don’t think it’s okay to say you want to help poverty while doing nothing to increase
economic activity if you have the resources. Letting someone use their skills
to earn a fair wage is a much more effective way to break the cycle of poverty.
We
don’t think it’s okay to overprice poorly made products in the name of
bettering the world while barely donating to the cause.
We
don’t think it’s okay to sell products with carcinogens while supporting cancer
awareness.
We
do believe that every action can be for good, and that’s the principle we’ve
built our supply chain around.

Ghandi said, ""In a gentle way, you can shake the world.""We've taken that to heart.







We know what we’re doing, and we know how to do it.
We've set up connections with local artisans and groups in several different cities, and we're ready to move forward with completing our supply chain. We just need funding to get there. 
Right now, our goal is to import products from the Bosh Bosh Project, because we feel they embody everything our company wants to achieve. By teaching girls a skill they can use to support themselves, and using the money to keep them in school, they're empowering women to break the cycle of poverty. Importing products from Liberia is complicated and costly though, and we don't have the funding to do this without your help!










For our perks, we don't want to list specific products we're importing, because the exact color/style combinations are uncertain. Many groups, and in particular the Bosh Bosh Project, use the local fabrics and scraps available to come up with their designs so we can't guarantee a particular color available in a particular style until we get the funding to bring them in. However, you can buy a gift card worth 1.25x it's purchase price to use on these products on our official launch! In addition, we have these great perks








In most perks, you'll receive a hand-written thank you from us. We truly appreciate the support, much more than the internet can convey! 





We wanted to create something special for our backers, so this design will only be available during our campaign. The first 50 backers will be able to receive it in t-shirt form for only $25, along with everything included in our change-maker package, AND you will receive it in time for the holidays! After the first 50 have been claimed, you will still be able to get the design by specifying it in the dreamer package, but they won't ship out until January. 
Every $500 we raise will unlock a new design choice, and we will e-mail you a survey at the end of the campaign to let you choose! Designs that have already been unlocked are available in the gallery. Sizes available are XS-XL.
Creating change is important to us, so even during the campaign $5 from every pledge that purchases a product will go our featured organizations, which you can readabout below.
*International shipping is available, just add $30!
Manufacturing
We want our impact on the world to be positive. All our perk items use low-impact dyes. This means they do not contain heavy metals or toxic substances, nor are they petro-chemically based. The absorption (or fixation) rate for these dyes averages 75%, which means less dye is used to produce our colors and less water is used to rinse them in the process. For fabrics, we use innovative eco-friendly offerings, knitting organic cotton with recycled polyester and rayon to create an incredibly comfortable product.
The ink we print with is free of most environmentally damaging chemicals such as PVC, phthalate, heavy metals, azo compounds, nonylphenol and formaldehyde. We screen print every shirt by hand, which gives them a unique feel, and keeps us from having electrical equipment running constantly.






We searched for, and found, some amazing organizations, and we think you should hear their stories.









The U.N. and World Health Organization define access to water and sanitation as a basic human right, yet many - primarily the homeless - go without.

<p>Our 3D printer has lived off of and learned from all its predecessors. We have been able to take the best of each and turn down the worst. The first feature that you can see at first glance is its sleek minimalist design. Giving it the deserved image for a revolutionary machine is what we have looked for. That was essential for RAScomRAS team. The technology inside will be a pleasure for any “great geek”; we have been able to put the best from Sanguinololu combined with the power of Raspberry Pi and the final Open Source great touch.</p>

<p> Many load their printers quickly with two extruders. We have wanted to give you the choice, because our cart is not only prepared for one or two extruders, but you will also be able to easily incorporate any type of extruder; so that your printer can accommodate to any new material. Its hot bed gives it greater reliability when having to print with more grip base.</p>
<p> Equipped with Wi-Fi, you will be able to control your printer not only from the incorporated-integrated 7” Tablet, but also from your web browser on any device from anywhere on the planet.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p> The closing door is a great accessory that will make your printer be 100 % safe for children and also for the not so small. </p>
<p> Safety is our major concern. So, we have equipped the RCR-D1 with a carbon fan to put everything in a good atmosphere. Its supplies area is standard so you can use any printing material in the market. We do not want to set limits on, although we recommend our consumables for a better performance. We donot want to tell you which ones to use, so you can use the ones you want.</p>

<p> We are passionate about Spanish and want to share it with the rest of the world. We believe that 3D printing is to create, to learn, to improve. For us, getting to know about other cultures, other points of view is as important as Science or Technology. </p>
<p> While the repository can also be used under any other subject, we would like that learning Spanish be as much fun as 3D printing. For that reason we wanted to do something different, something innovative. What do you have to lose? We think you have much to gain. </p>
<p> The 3D repository even in Beta, is the place to share &amp; show; a place where you can make anything just from a click. You can send any objetct to your printer without knowing about modelling; you will be able to customize already existing objects simply by means of open source editors. You can share projects with others in public or private, work with several people simultaneously on objects or compositions, create large objects and make some money out of them. </p>
<p> We are creating the 3D printing iTunes! </p>
<p> You may enjoy the apps &amp; repository both on the web platform and on the RAScomRAS OS. </p>

<p> OS such as Linux have been essential in the evolution of the OS that we enjoy today, open or closed. We have wanted to create an open 3D printing OS. Many will say that is just another app, but it is not. It is the first complete 3D printing system with which you will be able to control not only your 3D printer but all its functions that will make it operate and improve. We are working very hard to provide a quality software that makes 3D printing as simple as controlling a tablet and at the same time as advanced as an industrial management system. </p>

<p> We could share a comparative table between our printer and other 3D printers but we think it would be a waste of time. Today almost all 3D printers that have gone through indiegogo are very similar among them. We will not compare ours with printers that come from RepRap world, just like us. Our printing quality is equal to the rest, about 50 microns or even less. From the Makerbot to us has not changed much. However, here comes a differentiation: we promise that our printer will not make distinctions with everything new that will come. Thus, you will be able to vary your source of extrusion along with new software updates over anyone’s creation ahead. Has anyone ever promised you that? Our printer is like the rest of the Open Source world and we want to keep it like that. </p>
<p>Yet we will share some technical data so you can compare: </p>
<p> <b>Printing area:</b> X: 200mm Y: 200mm Z: 175mm</p>
<p> <b>Printing materials:</b> ABS, PLA, Nylon, PVA, PVE, Laywood, Lay-Brick</p>
<p> <b>Extruder:</b> V.5 0.5 mm (detachable extruder; may install pasta or chocolate extruder), It has the ability to integrate a layer fan. </p>
<p><b> Hot Bed:</b> Yes</p>

<p> We have seeked the 3D printing being simple and practical as one of our principles. We think we got it with RAScomRAS 3D printing environment. Once you get the RCR -D1 3D printer you just have to take little steps to start printing. Below you can find them: </p>
<p> <b>* Connect by means of network cable </b></p>
<p> <b>* Let the tablet on charge recommended , however we know you can not wait to start printing, so bring it charged and start making your first object. </b></p>
<p> <b>* Turn on and customize your printer (this step is recommended because you can have access to the printer from many sites and we want you to control it and not someone else) </b></p>
<p> <b>* Enter into the RAScomRAS App, download the item you like and enjoy your printing.</b></p>
<p> With these simple steps you will get to print any object. The RCR-D1 along with the RAScomRAS environment is as simple or advanced as you want it to be. That is the reason why is not only suitable for children from 6 to 85, but also for any professional in sectors as diverse as engineering, architecture, the world of jewelry and even baking. </p>
<p> Our printer comes with a single head. Although we know many others come with 2 extrusion heads, the RAScomRAS may be added not only with a second one but also you may incorporate a pasta or chocolate head or even any multi-head the RepRap world, us or yourself develop in the future. We wanted to make innovation as free as you want.</p>
<p> Calibrating or settings are over. Both the limit switches and our hot bed or even the extruder are fixed so that you will never have to calibrate or adjust anything. Studying the 2D printing has led us to just one conclusion: fixed elements makes calibration non existing. Since components are the same to any Open Source printer, you may change cards or extruders and still calibration will be set.</p>

<p> It is a logical evolution. We could give you a very nice 3D printer with high attributes, but would it be useful if you donot know how to make it work? So we believe that if we give you all means to get the most out of your printer on an intuitive and simple basis, you will be able to incorporate it not only into your life but also into your company. Our open source OS is faithfully adapted to any mobile device or computer. Controlling your printer will be as easy as turning it on, downloading or printing itself. Should you need go beyond, we are ready for it and we have a reserved place for all developers who want to include their app's. To begin with you can enjoy a 3D scan, a full repository of objects, a manual control system and a printing removal system. You will be able to print on 3D as well as 2D. Just as easy you watch a video on Youtube, you will edit objects. </p>

<p> We believe that the future of 3D printing relies on materials and items to be made upon them, so we do not want to set limits on our 3D printer. You will be able to print not only with any material nowadays on market, but RAScomRAS wants to go further. We are researching on new printing materials like graphene polymer. We assure you that your RCR-D1 can print on any material for 3D printing already in the market and will be able with the ones that come out in the future. This is because your software will be continuosly updated remotely and simultaneously all the printer updates will be available for you either for you to make or acquire. </p>

Architects, engineers, students, entrepreneurs and anyone who has an idea or just would like to construct an object, may be a 3D printing user. •	RCR-D1 RAScomRAS printer. Our 3D printer gathers all the great qualities of 3D printers on market. The latter have been remarkably improved. You will be able to print on many materials (ABS, PLA, PVA, PVE, Nylon and even with a small click & changing of extruder you can print in chocolate or pasta; the possibilities are endless). Connectivity has no boundaries, the D1 comes with a 7 inches Android OS Tablet and the RAScomRAS App; all that will make 3D printing a children’s play.




 •	RAScomRAS 3D Object Repository. We keep it simple and easy from your computer, from mobile and from the tablet; that is why we are creating a repository of 3D objects from which you can download all the items that you need and also the great designers; they will be able to put themselves out there.





 •	App open source. We come from and believe in the Open Source movement, so our apps and other’s will be available online for you; that way you may even improve them or share them. 3D objects editors, 3D scan, printing enhancement formulas.





Our 3D printer has lived off of and learned from all its predecessors. We have been able to take the best of each and turn down the worst. The first feature that you can see at first glance is its sleek minimalist design. Giving it the deserved image for a revolutionary machine is what we have looked for. That was essential for RAScomRAS team. The technology inside will be a pleasure for any “great geek”; we have been able to put the best from Sanguinololu combined with the power of Raspberry Pi and the final Open Source great touch.





 Many load their printers quickly with two extruders. We have wanted to give you the choice, because our cart is not only prepared for one or two extruders, but you will also be able to easily incorporate any type of extruder; so that your printer can accommodate to any new material. Its hot bed gives it greater reliability when having to print with more grip base.
 Equipped with Wi-Fi, you will be able to control your printer not only from the incorporated-integrated 7” Tablet, but also from your web browser on any device from anywhere on the planet.

 The closing door is a great accessory that will make your printer be 100 % safe for children and also for the not so small. 
 Safety is our major concern. So, we have equipped the RCR-D1 with a carbon fan to put everything in a good atmosphere. Its supplies area is standard so you can use any printing material in the market. We do not want to set limits on, although we recommend our consumables for a better performance. We donot want to tell you which ones to use, so you can use the ones you want.






 We are passionate about Spanish and want to share it with the rest of the world. We believe that 3D printing is to create, to learn, to improve. For us, getting to know about other cultures, other points of view is as important as Science or Technology. 
 While the repository can also be used under any other subject, we would like that learning Spanish be as much fun as 3D printing. For that reason we wanted to do something different, something innovative. What do you have to lose? We think you have much to gain. 
 The 3D repository even in Beta, is the place to share & show; a place where you can make anything just from a click. You can send any objetct to your printer without knowing about modelling; you will be able to customize already existing objects simply by means of open source editors. You can share projects with others in public or private, work with several people simultaneously on objects or compositions, create large objects and make some money out of them. 
 We are creating the 3D printing iTunes! 
 You may enjoy the apps & repository both on the web platform and on the RAScomRAS OS. 
 

 OS such as Linux have been essential in the evolution of the OS that we enjoy today, open or closed. We have wanted to create an open 3D printing OS. Many will say that is just another app, but it is not. It is the first complete 3D printing system with which you will be able to control not only your 3D printer but all its functions that will make it operate and improve. We are working very hard to provide a quality software that makes 3D printing as simple as controlling a tablet and at the same time as advanced as an industrial management system. 




 We could share a comparative table between our printer and other 3D printers but we think it would be a waste of time. Today almost all 3D printers that have gone through indiegogo are very similar among them. We will not compare ours with printers that come from RepRap world, just like us. Our printing quality is equal to the rest, about 50 microns or even less. From the Makerbot to us has not changed much. However, here comes a differentiation: we promise that our printer will not make distinctions with everything new that will come. Thus, you will be able to vary your source of extrusion along with new software updates over anyone’s creation ahead. Has anyone ever promised you that? Our printer is like the rest of the Open Source world and we want to keep it like that. 
Yet we will share some technical data so you can compare: 
 Printing area: X: 200mm Y: 200mm Z: 175mm
 Printing materials: ABS, PLA, Nylon, PVA, PVE, Laywood, Lay-Brick
 Extruder: V.5 0.5 mm (detachable extruder; may install pasta or chocolate extruder), It has the ability to integrate a layer fan. 
 Hot Bed: Yes
 7"" inches Tablet: Yes (printing control using Tablet 7"" comes along with the printer; auto-updatable)
 Closing door: Apart from the printing kit. 
Software: Open Source RAScomRAS OS. 
 Electronics: Compatible with Sanguinololu + Raspberry Pi
 Air Filter: Carbon 
 Remote Control: Yes. Wi-fi, ip proxy system 
 Auto off: Yes 
 Colors: White Crystal Limited Edition 





 We have seeked the 3D printing being simple and practical as one of our principles. We think we got it with RAScomRAS 3D printing environment. Once you get the RCR -D1 3D printer you just have to take little steps to start printing. Below you can find them: 
 * Connect by means of network cable 
 * Let the tablet on charge recommended , however we know you can not wait to start printing, so bring it charged and start making your first object. 
 * Turn on and customize your printer (this step is recommended because you can have access to the printer from many sites and we want you to control it and not someone else) 
 * Enter into the RAScomRAS App, download the item you like and enjoy your printing.
 With these simple steps you will get to print any object. The RCR-D1 along with the RAScomRAS environment is as simple or advanced as you want it to be. That is the reason why is not only suitable for children from 6 to 85, but also for any professional in sectors as diverse as engineering, architecture, the world of jewelry and even baking. 
 Our printer comes with a single head. Although we know many others come with 2 extrusion heads, the RAScomRAS may be added not only with a second one but also you may incorporate a pasta or chocolate head or even any multi-head the RepRap world, us or yourself develop in the future. We wanted to make innovation as free as you want.
 Calibrating or settings are over. Both the limit switches and our hot bed or even the extruder are fixed so that you will never have to calibrate or adjust anything. Studying the 2D printing has led us to just one conclusion: fixed elements makes calibration non existing. Since components are the same to any Open Source printer, you may change cards or extruders and still calibration will be set.
 

 It is a logical evolution. We could give you a very nice 3D printer with high attributes, but would it be useful if you donot know how to make it work? So we believe that if we give you all means to get the most out of your printer on an intuitive and simple basis, you will be able to incorporate it not only into your life but also into your company. Our open source OS is faithfully adapted to any mobile device or computer. Controlling your printer will be as easy as turning it on, downloading or printing itself. Should you need go beyond, we are ready for it and we have a reserved place for all developers who want to include their app's. To begin with you can enjoy a 3D scan, a full repository of objects, a manual control system and a printing removal system. You will be able to print on 3D as well as 2D. Just as easy you watch a video on Youtube, you will edit objects. 


 We believe that the future of 3D printing relies on materials and items to be made upon them, so we do not want to set limits on our 3D printer. You will be able to print not only with any material nowadays on market, but RAScomRAS wants to go further. We are researching on new printing materials like graphene polymer. We assure you that your RCR-D1 can print on any material for 3D printing already in the market and will be able with the ones that come out in the future. This is because your software will be continuosly updated remotely and simultaneously all the printer updates will be available for you either for you to make or acquire. 


 You will not need internet or hi-fi at home to control your printer. We give everything out to control it from your tablet, which will be already connected once your turn it on and you will only have to connect to the internet in order to download others objects. If you already have items on your computer, you will just have to activate your printer as if it were a 2D and send your file. As simple as that!

Made in the USA. The Gaston Collective offers unique and
products that adorn, delight, and empower the wearer. Artisan-designed and made
in America, we believe that jewelry is a simple yet meaningful way for people
to tell their story through personal adornment. The Collective brings together American suppliers and artists, supporting them with a living wage and meaningful and enjoyable work. Environmental responsibility is
also a prime factor in our mission. Our jewelry is cast in a 
verified
green, non-toxic, sustainable workshop.
In today’s ever-changing retail
market, the discerning customer is turning more toward domestic goods and
products. In the world of cookie-cutter mall experiences, shoppers are
continually looking for that unique piece that will set them apart from the crowd. Gaston Collective Jewelry is ready to meet that challenge by sourcing,
designing, and assembling jewelry in the USA. While the designs and charms are
original and proprietary to the company, many of the materials used are re purposed and recycled from other sources, thus supporting the company's commitment to preserving the environment and keeping it “green.”Gaston Collective is a new direction for business owner Jessica Gaston. Expanding on her successful jewelry component company, Jess is poised to launch
into a new market. Current trends reflect a
great opportunity in the jewelry industry for well-designed,
fashionable, and affordable jewelry. She is ready to meet that demand by
gathering industry experts and relying on the support of her business contacts and resources
collected over her 20 years in the industry. The visionary behind Gaston
Collective Jewelry is Jessica Gaston, an entrepreneur with over 20 years in the
jewelry business. Always with her finger on the pulse of the fashion jewelry
world, Jessica has identified a niche in the ever-growing ready-made jewelry market and is ready to take her product to a national level. She is backed by
a team of dedicated jewelry designers and entrepreneurs who bring passion, imagination, and over 100 years of combined experience in the jewelry industry.
Jessica Gaston, CEO Jessica Gaston began studying the arts early, with a
special affinity for painting and photography. Now, as a jewelry designer and
collector, she loves seeing her ideas come to fruition in wearable art. Clients
such as Betsey Johnson, Urban Outfitters and the National Gallery of Art are among
those who appreciate Jess’s unique style.

Jess created her business from scratch starting
in India. Every time she returns, she’s inspired all over again by the intense
color palates, long and storied history of jewelry, and seeing the way the
women adorn themselves. Jess is passionate about colored and organic diamonds,
and mixing metals to showcase each gem’s most beautiful traits.
The best part about Jess’s work is the
flexibility and creativity she’s able act on every day. She loves meeting
interesting people when she travels and is happy to pass on her knowledge
through her workshops.

<p>Throughout

<p>How are
protest, resistance and ideals expressed through clothing, not only from the

view? Do we conform our style based on a certain way of living or on a sense of
idealism? Or do we express ourselves through slogans on T-shirts and badges? </p>
<p>The
collection is a tribute to all historical and contemporary pioneers who are
risking their honour, freedom and occasionally also their life in order to
change the world for the better. </p>

<p>To fight for

<p>An important

Folkloric and tribal elements are combined with the classic ""Western""

mystical and as the show progresses, the transition from dark to light will be made.
In line with the inspiration and the title of the collection, the use of smoke
will be an integral part of the presentation.</p>

We would love to do our own kind of show, within the frames of the Fashion Week tent! We would be so gratefull if you would help making this an reality, and to tell a story through a show that adresses political and social issues of the world we live in!The MADS
DINESEN fashion label showcases the creative exploits of its Danish-born
designer and operates from Berlin, Germany. In 2010, Mads Dinesen graduated
from the UdK University of the arts in Berlin with the menswear collection
""Pain is felt by all..."". For this collection, he was nominated several
times in international competitions, among which the 2011 Hyères 26th
International Fashion and Photography Festival (Jury: Raf Simons, Christopher
Kane, Prouenza Schouler, Tim Blanks, etc.) and the Mango Fashion Awards 4th
Edition 2012 (Jury: Carolina Herrera, Kate Moss, Derek Blasberg, etc.). 
After two
striking collection presentations/installations in gallery spaces, a show at
the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week would signify another leap forward for the label
MADS DINESEN, and it would allow for the designer to expand upon his previous
successes in delivering a unique show experience.  


Danish-born Berliner Mads Dinesen is
one of the most striking fashion talents in town, all the while being one of the most
idiosyncratic.
Nina
Trippel, Cee Cee 01/2013
The fashion house of Dinesen combines an
in-depth working knowledge of impeccable tailoring and a passionate approach to
fine craftsmanship. The street models he carefully selects evoke the fabric of
the contemporary human condition and their physical presence permeates through
the layers of each costume to reveal its essential materiality. In so doing,
the spectacular presentations of his collections evoke a raw and primal energy,
though the experience remains determinedly brutal and contemporary in relation
to the environmental and social-political nature of the world around us. His
consistent interest in spirituality and his intensive research into tribal and
nomadic culture impacts the physical world we inhabit when wearing a Dinesen
piece. His work is haunting and beautiful, grotesque yet bold, and it is as
compelling as it is taboo. He seeks to dismantle our preconceived notions about
sexuality and physical beauty. Through his imagery, we gain a greater

<p><b>FLIP-FLOPS
FOREVER</b></p>
<p>Hello, I have been an amputee for
the past 27 years. My leg was amputated after being crushed between two cars on
a highway in Carson City, NV. I was nineteen years old at the time and cruising
on a basketball scholarship at a small college. Since then I have been a
triathlete, pro inline skater, speaker, stuntman and inventor. Prior to losing
my leg I always wore flip-flops. After losing my leg I wore 
different types of heavy strap on sandals. They didn't stay on very well and as I said were heavy and costly so I never really liked them. Wearing a split-toe foot is not an option since the loss of performance and durability won't work with my lifestyle. <br/></p><p>For years I have had a simple solution for converting
almost any flip-flop to fit a prosthetic foot and still look mostly normal and
even stylish. With the advent of the new breed of high quality industrial 3-D
printers I now can share that with all
amputees around the world at a low cost. There is no longer a need to buy a separate foot for
flip-flops or those pricey sandals. I have found that low cost Old Navy flip
flops work great. I am putting together a deal with an American Flip-Flop
company to use their high-quality flip-flops with my design and sell directly
to amputees. I need one of the new industrial 3-D
printers coming on the market to go into production. <br/></p><p>I
am here at Indiegogo asking for a chance at sharing this design to make this world a little more foot
friendly to those of us missing a foot or two.</p>

<p>The second way; This is really for the

<br/><p>Lola's belief is that every country has something wonderful to offer, something that is indigenous to their people and a desire to be shared. </p>
<p>With so many products out there produced by large multinational companies purely for shareholder value and not in the interest of the consumer, our health, the environment or our sustainable future; we chose to speak out.</p>
<p>We all make choices everyday, what we do, what we eat and drink or other lifestyle desires <b>but </b>there are products we use everyday and expect or at least have some reasonable expectation that they are safe and not toxic. That is not the case in personal care items and most specifically skincare products. Our skin, the largest organ absorbs over 60% of what it comes in contact with. Due to a recent illness in our family, did we begin to understand and educate ourselves.</p>
<p>So we chose to go into business and develop <b>Lola's Wings</b> as a way to speak out and share the benefits of organics. We believe the old saying, ""beauty is skin deep"" is so far from the truth and that our beauty shines from within. <br/></p>

<p>Most of us get up in the morning, brush our teeth, shower, dressed and get ready for our day. We do this for good hygiene, it makes us feel good and we want to be able to present ourselves in a manner of our choosing. With the selection from <b>Lola's Wings</b>, one can do just that and have the confidence of what you are using and wearing is better for you and the environment. A lifestyle choice and variety that has not been available until now.<br/></p>

<h2>Why We Are Here</h2>
<p>We are very proud to be on <b>Indiegogo </b>and have the opportunity to present ourselves to you. <b>Lola's Wings </b>is seeking your support to help fund our passion and bring our business to fruition and beyond. Our company is unconventional and certainly not mainstream, so we have chosen this platform to raise capital and let you the people be an integral part of our beginning. With your support, we know that you have an interest in us and will help contribute to complete the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish our website and shopping cart</li>
<li>Purchase inventory</li>
<li>Begin a solid marketing campaign</li>
<li>Secure a shipping and distribution location</li>
<li>Develop our brand image through social media and the blogosphere</li>
<li>Launch our site</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Funding Goal</h2>
<p>In crowd funding it is said to have a very realistic goal, meet that goal and then surpass it many times over with your momentum, your excitement and your support.

We are Lola's Wings primarily a woman's lifestyle e-commerce boutique. Lola's is also an acronym for who we are; Luxury Organics, Lingerie, Activewear & Skincare
Lola's Wings is a unique concept and shopping experience for today's woman that is eco-friendly, active with a healthy lifestyle and fashion conscious.
We are a father and daughter start up, with a strong business background, an entrepreneurial spirit, an education in women's studies and a team with vast experience in internet marketing, organics and skincare. A passion for what we are about to undertake and a work ethic to deliver.  
What we do...

Our lifestyle site will be like no other. We have sourced the world over for the finest international brands in Organic Skincare, Organic fashion minded Apparel, including Yoga Attire, Activewear and Exquisite Lingerie.

Lola's will offer a choice to the consumer that is not readily available at your local mall or on the web. Our brands are good for your mind, body and spirit. Lola's Wings will create a shopping experience as if you had traveled to an exotic locale and walked into an international boutique, not just hitting the buy button and proceeding to check out.
Not to worry men, we will soon add skincare, shaving products and apparel for you too. We will also be adding products for mother and baby and children as well.                                     Contribute Now and Select your Perk------------------------->                 



 Including the e-commerce side of business, our site will publish an online magazine called Lola for the reading pleasure of our visitors.
                                                                  Select a Perk and Contribute---------------->

 The magazine will have articles of interest and entertainment for today's woman. Our stories will be about women in business and leadership, sport, academia, fitness, yoga, ayurveda, fashion, lifestyle and many others all by contributing writers from around the world.We believe this approach will also be most beneficial to young women and teens by focusing on such issues in a positive way.Why Contribute to Us?
 You, the contributor can help fund a startup that rocks with the smart ideals of today for our tomorrow.
Having the confidence to spread the word about your lifestyle through the support of Lola's Wings, yes you will receive a perk for your contribution but it is a lot more than just that.
Helping to create and be on the ground floor of a Woman's Life Style magazine called Lola that will focus on issues of today's woman. It is our hope to promote self confidence and self esteem for the young women of today, through our powerful and inspirational articles.
Knowing that our products are safe, ethically produced and made with quality natural ingredients that few others could match.
Are we a feel good company? You bet and proud of it! 
You want to feel good too, knowing when you purchase something or throw your support towards a company that they are following similar ideals.That they are providing a safe & clean work environment, that their products are chemical free, not destroying our natural resources and planet. But many products, from many large retailers knowingly or unknowingly have these products on their store shelves.
Contribute to Lola's Wings, we promise to lead the way.

Our Beliefs...


Lola's belief is that every country has something wonderful to offer, something that is indigenous to their people and a desire to be shared. 
With so many products out there produced by large multinational companies purely for shareholder value and not in the interest of the consumer, our health, the environment or our sustainable future; we chose to speak out.
We all make choices everyday, what we do, what we eat and drink or other lifestyle desires but there are products we use everyday and expect or at least have some reasonable expectation that they are safe and not toxic. That is not the case in personal care items and most specifically skincare products. Our skin, the largest organ absorbs over 60% of what it comes in contact with. Due to a recent illness in our family, did we begin to understand and educate ourselves.
So we chose to go into business and develop Lola's Wings as a way to speak out and share the benefits of organics. We believe the old saying, ""beauty is skin deep"" is so far from the truth and that our beauty shines from within. 

Most of us get up in the morning, brush our teeth, shower, dressed and get ready for our day. We do this for good hygiene, it makes us feel good and we want to be able to present ourselves in a manner of our choosing. With the selection from Lola's Wings, one can do just that and have the confidence of what you are using and wearing is better for you and the environment. A lifestyle choice and variety that has not been available until now.

The Brands...

Lola's Wings will proudly represent exclusive brands from Australia, Bali, Brazil, Columbia, Finland, France, India, Italy, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Tahiti, United Kingdom and the United States. All of our products have been carefully selected for their quality and contemporary design, proven efficacy, international awards, certifications and commitment to a sustainable future.

Organic Skincare that is both vegan and certified organic, produced with fruits, flowers, and plant extract.
                Fund Lola's Wings by selecting your Perk---------->
  Organic Apparel of cotton, bamboo, hemp, linen and wool.   Yoga Attire that's comfortable, peaceful, fashion minded and all natural. Activewear that's ready when you are, great fitting and suitable for all types of sport.
  Lingerie that is elegant, both sensual and exquisite for that romantic time with your loved one.

Kreditkartenzahlung: wir wurden gefragt, warum man das Projekt nicht über Kreditkarte unterstützen kann. Indiegogo bietet für €-Kampagnen leider keine direkte Kreditkartenzahlung an, man kann jedoch über PayPal mit Kreditkarte zahlen, ohne dort einen Account haben zu müssen. Mehr dazu unten in den FAQ - Häufig gestellten Umfragen. 

Deutsch/Englisch: Außerdem erscheint das Menü bzw. die Zahlungsmodalitäten hier auf dieser Seite bei vielen in Englisch. Das liegt daran, dass Indiegogo standardmäßig auf Englisch betrieben wird. Man kann jedoch ganz unten rechts die Sprache umstellen, siehe ebenfalls FAQ. 
IBAN/BIC: Wir haben die Daten zu IBAN und BIC unten ergänzt. 
----- ----- for english short description please scroll to the bottom ----- -----SOLiPOWER - Photovoltaik statt DieselUnter dem Namen Fairytale Fashion betreiben wir seit mehreren Jahren ein Modelabel in Österreich für bio-faire Damenmode - designed in Austria, handmade in Nepal. Gemeinsam mit unserer Partnerschneiderei in Kathmandu erarbeiten wir Kollektionen, bei denen wir die traditionelle nepalesische Sticktechnik mit europäischen Designtrends verweben. Dabei werden die einzelnen Kleidungsstücke überwiegend aus Biobaumwolle hergestellt, Taschen aus edlen Khadi-Stoffen. Wir machen nicht Mode, weil es zu wenig Mode gibt. Wir machen Mode, weil es zu wenig bio-faire Mode gibt - und das leistbar und trendig für unterschiedlichste Frauen!Nepal ist eines der ärmsten Länder der Welt und hat unter anderem große Probleme mit der Energieversorgung. Täglich fällt in Kathmandu stundenlang der Strom aus und somit gibt es in unserer Schneiderei kein Licht und auch keinen Strom für die Nähmaschinen. Aktuell arbeitet die Schneiderei daher mit einem Diesel-Notstrom-Aggregat, um diese
Stromausfälle zu überbrücken. Da wir nicht nur auf faire Arbeitsbedingungen achten, sondern als Klimabündnis-Betrieb auch versuchen in der gesamten Produktionskette umweltfreundlich zu arbeiten, haben wir nach einer Lösung gesucht, um auch in Kathmandu umweltfreundliche Maßnahmen umzusetzen. Aus diesem Grund wollen wir anstatt des Notstrom-Aggregats eine Photovoltaik-Anlage anschaffen und installieren. Zur Zeit re-investieren wir jedoch unser gesamtes, erwirtschaftetes Geld in den Ankauf
von Biobaumwolle und die Ausbezahlung gerechter Löhne an unsere Mitarbeiter. Daher haben wir das Projekt SOLiPOWER gestartet: gemeinsam mit euch wollen wir unserem Ziel einer fairen UND ökologischen Mode-Produktion in Nepal näher kommen und ersuchen euch, uns dabei zu unterstützen: Wenn es uns gelingt, in den kommenden Wochen 
15.000 Euro einzusammeln, 

kann unsere Partner-Schneiderei 
eine Photovoltaik-Anlage installieren. In diesen Kosten ist die Anschaffung sowie die Installation der Photovoltaik-Anlage enthalten. Nach der Errichtung wird die Photovoltaik-Anlage zur Gänze in den Besitz der Schneiderei übergehen. Für die Abwicklung des Kaufs und des Aufbaus der Anlage zeichnet Hari Gautam, Leiter unserer Partner-Schneiderei verantwortlich. Er wird alles in die Wege leiten und dokumentieren. Für eure Unterstützung haben wir uns originelle Gegenleistungen einfallen lassen, die ihr euch abhängig von der Höhe eures Beitrags auf der rechten Seite aussuchen könnt. Zum Beispiel habt ihr die Möglichkeit, mit uns gemeinsam an einem Fair Trade Mode-Workshop für den Entwurf eines individuellen Einzelstücks oder bei einem exklusiven Foto-Shooting im Fairytale Fashion Style teilzunehmen.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Bri Seeley has been <em>personally</em> invited to show her new collection of women's fashion, Escape, at LA Style Fashion Week in October, 2012. This opportunity was presented to her with minimal time to budget for the expense of the entry fee, but it's an opportunity she CANNOT say no to! Bri is a highly talented designer and is excited to expand her brand with your help!</p>
<p>Bri Seeley is:<br/>1. 100% Made in America <br/>2. Natural and regenerated, high quality fibers <br/>3. Uniquely luxurious feminine fashion designed to outlive trends and be worn over a multitude of seasons<br/>4. Empowerment and pride in women's fashion</p>
<p>Style Fashion Week is the newest and most ambitious fashion week to emerge from Los Angeles. The week of events consist of a welcome party for VIP and Media, followed by five days of runway shows. Style Fashion Week LA has made a global impact on the fashion scene by presenting fashion in new ways, merging interior design with fashion design, and giving Los Angeles based designers a world-class platform to showcase their collections. SFW represents the diverse culture that embodies the people of L.A., making the City of Angels a fashion hub, and being a leader in the world’s fashion community where it belongs.</p>

<p>Au Baby's vision is to transform the look of breastfeeding advocacy and needs your support to become real. Au Baby seeks to inspire, educate, and raise funds and awareness for breastfeeding.</p>
<p>I am a mother of three breastfed babies, and hope to help remove the barriers that prevent women from reaching their breastfeeding goals. Of the more than 75% of women in the US who initiate breastfeeding, less than half reach their goals, and only 13% are exclusively breastfeeding six months later. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that women should breastfeed babies for at least one year.</p>
<p><strong>The Vision</strong></p>
<p>My vision is that each year in August, starting August 2014, during National Breastfeeding Awareness month, women will paint their eyelids with bright gold eye shadow in order to raise funds for breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Why gold? Gold, the element Au, is chosen because of its shared properties with breastmilk: delicate, precious and valuable - one drop is like liquid gold!</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to transform how breastfeeding advocacy looks into an attractive, non-controversial, relatable promotion with mass-appeal in order to enable women to start and keep breastfeeding as long as they want. </p>
<p><strong>The statistics on why breastfeeding is a worthy cause:</strong></p>
<p>There are roughly 156 million women in the US. 81% will become mothers by the age of 44.77% will start breastfeeding, but less than half will reach their goals. </p>
<p><strong>The Barriers to Breastfeeding</strong></p>
<p>The funds raised will go to existing organization helping to remove the barriers that prevent mothers from reaching their breastfeeding goals, which include:</p>
<p>1. A rough or painful start</p>
<p>2. Worry about not enough milk</p>
<p>3. Discomfort with breastfeeding in public</p>
<p>4. Going back to work</p>
<p><strong>Non-Controversial, Mass Appeal</strong></p>
<p>Breastfeeding can be an uncomfortable topic, even for supporters. This campaign will transform how the cause is promoted. The simple daily routine of applying make-up is relatable for many women. With the stroke of a brush you can ‘Make August Glow’ with a visible outward symbol to easily display support.</p>
<p><strong>How it Will Work</strong></p>
<p>The campaign will live on <a href=""http://aubaby.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">aubaby.org</a>, where women can create a profile, seek sponsorship from friends and family for wearing the shadow for 31 days, and receive electronic donations through the website.</p>
<p><strong>Where the Money Goes<br/></strong></p>
<p>Your donation will go towards website development to create the campaign website at aubaby.org.</p>

Every month, you will receive a graphic novel along with goodies that relates to the theme of the month or even the book itself! Goodies such as art prints, shirts, collectible toys, bath and beauty, and many more! Sometimes we will include another book that we like to consider a classic.

<p><strong>What Will We Do with the Indiegogo Money? </strong></p>
<p>We recognize that we are asking for some of your hard-earned money. We are running this Indiegogo so we can create a brand new online store, <strong>John’s Crazy Christmas Store</strong>, and a line of products to sell in that store.

<ul>
<li>Christmas and Holiday Socks from a new line of John’s Crazy Socks.</li>

<li>We Give Back. We will donate 5 percent of our earnings from the Christmas Store to the Special Olympics. </li>
<li>Every package from the Christmas store will get a thank you note from John and some candy.</li>

<p><strong>Be Part of a Christmas Store that Can Change the World</strong></p>
<p>We are a small business, yet all we want to do is change the world. We want to spread happiness to a world that often seems harsher and meaner by the day.

<p><strong>Showing What People with Differing Abilities Can Do</strong></p>
<p>John has Down syndrome, but he always says, ""Down syndrome never holds me back."" John told his Dad that he wanted to go into business with him and John came up with the idea to sell Crazy Socks.

<p>How do we show what people with differing abilities can do? We built our business on the principle that we would look at what people can do, not what they cannot do. Here's what we do:</p>

</div></div>","John and John's Crazy Christmas Store
At John's Crazy Socks, everything we do starts with John, our co-founder, inspiration and Chief Happiness Officer. A young man with Down syndrome, it was his idea to start John’s Crazy Socks due to his love of socks.
Now John wants to start John’s Crazy Christmas Store. John says, “Christmas is my favorite holiday. Everybody loves Christmas.”  
You may have heard about John and John's Crazy Socks because you saw John on TV. He was the first person with Down syndrome to win the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award;  he testified twice before Congress and spoke at the U.N. and when you see John dance, you cannot stop smiling.  John likes to say, ""I have Down syndrome and Down syndrome never holds me back."" 

Why create John's Crazy Christmas Store?
John is on a mission to spread happiness and what better time to share joy than at the holidays? This new online store will let us:

Create a line of John's holiday items: socks, ornaments, cards, pajama pants, etc.  
Spread more happiness.
Hire more people with differing abilities.
Raise more money for our charity partners.
Have more fun.


The new Christmas store will be an expansion of the social enterprise at John's Crazy Socks. Here's what we do at John's Crazy Socks: :

We spread happiness every day. 
We show the world what people with differing abilities can do.
We give back to charity partners like the Special Olympics, National Down Syndrome Society , the Autism Society of America  and Autism Speaks.
We deliver the world's best socks all with a personal touch: candy and a thank you note from John.


We have have happy customers. We have over 22,000 online reviews and 96 percent are five star reviews. We have over 220,000 Facebook followers and last year, we shipped over 144,000 orders across the U.S. and to 80 different countries. We have raised over $300,000 for our charity partners and more than half our employees have a differing ability. Haven't heard about John's Crazy Socks? Check out this profile from the CBS Evening News or this story from Fox.  
We Need Your Help to Make a Christmas Store Like No Other
What's better than a Christmas Store dedicated to spreading happiness?

A Christmas Store that employs people with differing abilities and shows the world what they can do.
A Christmas store that gives back to charity partners.

 
We are asking for your help in creating just such a store.   Everything we create and sell in our Christmas Store will pass three tests:

It must spread happiness
It must be fun
John must be excited about it 



What Will We Do with the Indiegogo Money? 
We recognize that we are asking for some of your hard-earned money. We are running this Indiegogo so we can create a brand new online store, John’s Crazy Christmas Store, and a line of products to sell in that store. We will use the funds to design and produce our first products:  

Christmas and Holiday Socks from a new line of John’s Crazy Socks.
Holiday Cards designed by people with differing abilities.
Christmas ornaments designed by people with differing abilities.
Wrapping paper designed by people with differing abilities. 
Christmas hats and stockings.
John’s Crazy Pajama Pants.

We will also use some of the funds to make changes in our warehouse for the new products and to make changes at our website for the new store. 

​We will make the Christmas gifts that you can love, but that's only the beginning:

People with differing abilities will design the products.
We will hire more people with differing abilities to work in our fulfillment. We call our colleagues Sock Wranglers and Happiness Packers
We show the world what people with differing abilities can do by making videos, holding school tours and hosting work groups for schools and social service agencies
We Give Back. We will donate 5 percent of our earnings from the Christmas Store to the Special Olympics. 
Every package from the Christmas store will get a thank you note from John and some candy.

This store will enable us to create more jobs, to show more of what people with differing abilities can do and to spread more happiness. We have asked our customers if they would like to see us offer a Christmas store and we received an overwhelming positive response.

What about the Perks?
We love our customers and supporters and have designed perks to spread happiness and say thank you to our backers. We have a range of rewards that start with thanking you on our website to John hand-delivering custom socks to anywhere in the continental U.S. Here are some of the rewards available to you:

A set of three Christmas or Hannukah socks made exclusively for our Indiegogo backers
A box of 20 Christmas cards designed by people with differing abilities 
A John's Crazy Socks Santa hat
Having your name added to our Big Book of Gratitude
Having John make a personalized video for you
Receiving a Certificate that you are a Holiday Legend 
Receiving a tour of our office and warehouse with John for you and your friends and then eating lunch with John
Designing socks with John. You get 100 pairs and we will sell them in our store with 10 percent of the sales going to the charity you choose that supports people with differing abilities
Designing socks and then having John hand-deliver them to you. He will bring lunch or speak in front of an audience of your choosing: your company, your school, your non-profit fundraiser, etc. 


 
We have already begun working on designs for products in the Christmas store and identifying our manufacturing partners. If the Indiegogo succeeds, we will finish the designs and place the orders in August. We will receive delivery of the products by November with a promised delivery date no later than the first week of December, well before Christmas. We have experience delivering on time (that's why we have so many happy customers) and can ship over 2,000 orders a day. You can count on us to deliver your rewards on time. 

Be Part of a Christmas Store that Can Change the World

<p>My name is Asherah and I am a clothing designer, healer and facilitator for the awakening of this planet into a higher consciousness of life. I have been working with my clothing line the last 3 years where I have brought out 3 successful collections (<a href=""http://www.asherahsoulclothing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.asherahsoulclothing.com</a>). However, in the prior collections, it hasn't been able to make all of the processes organic. </p>
<p>With this campaign, I aspire for my collections to turn fully green and work with only organic, eco-friendly fabrics that are dyed with vegetable colours. The process of the production of the natural fibres is done without chemicals, therefore, it keeps the soils healthy and also protects the workers of getting contaminated by the toxins from the crop as well as from the dying process. Organic and Sustainable clothing benefits the earth and the workers and has an impact on YOU who will be wearing the magnificent garments. It is much healthier for our skins and our souls. </p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign we can make it happen together! You are not only supporting the birth of my dream in creating High Vibrational Garments on all levels, but you are also supporting the evolution of consciousness in bringing more awareness to every being that will purchase this clothing. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>I will need approximately 5500 Euro in order to make this Dream come true. The funds contributed go into the fabrics, which are almost 4 times the price of conventional fabrics, as well as into the veg-dying process which is a separate procedure. The funds also go into the sewing and making of the garments. Within my production, we only use the highest quality of machines and threads. It is important to highlight that the production of my collection also supports women in India by giving them work on fair wages. The funds will also be used to cover the post-production processes, where I will be focusing on getting various high-quality photo shoots so that you can see the products in the best and most exact way!</p>

I am also mindful of industrial productions and so I request certificates and proof from all companies that I buy the fabric with to be sure that it is qualified.

</b><p>My name is Jessica and I am the founder of Liebling and
 Burke, an online fashion haven consisting of current fashion forward looks and vintage 
clothing for plus size girls. For years I have been in love with 
fashion, but fashion more often than not, hasn't been in love with me. 
Falling somewhere above the size 16 margin can prove to be more than 
difficult when shopping, it's down right frustrating. What you so often find are styles

<li> Complete building the website. (most plus size websites are pretty cheesy!) I want girls to be able to shop with ease on a cool and clean looking site made just for them. A beautiful site that just happens to be plus size is the goal!<br/>
</li>
<li>I am also on the hunt for a seamstress in downtown LA to create pieces like cool tees and dresses out of rad fabric. Cool fabric can be pretty pricey and I want to offer great options!<br/>
</li>
<li>I will also be able to keep the shop stocked with clothes that I am able to source. Although let me tell you, there isn't much out there, but I am being very selective in what I choose and only pick the absolute best pieces. Often times plus size girls get stuck with this mentality that if it fits I better buy it because I don't know the next time something I kinda like will come along. I know this because I am that girl. I know what's missing from the plus size market and with your help I will be able to change that!</li>
<li>I have included some fun perks that you will receive (while they last!) Handwritten thank you cards, fun pencils that say things like ""start a revolution"", tote bags that say ""whateva whateva"" and logo tee shirts with my favorite and shop motto ""Ignore the Should""!<br/>

<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to view the Trep Wear
crowdfunding campaign. This is a very exciting time for us, and we want to give
you the opportunity to be a part of the Trep Wear family from the very start. With
your help from the very beginning, we can ensure that Trep Wear is a huge
success and begin to fund numerous young entrepreneurs everywhere.</p>
<p>In business, trust is everything. You should know the
background of the visionary behind the project that you are funding, so first
let me tell you a little bit more about myself, Zach Engle, founder of Trep
Wear.</p>
<p>I have always been an entrepreneur my whole life. From
telling my mother I wanted to be a salesman at age 3, to selling bubble gum and
candy at school at age 10, I have always had the entrepreneurial mindset. In
2008 at age 20, I started my own cleaning company in central Indiana. 6 years
later, <a href=""www.TheCleaningSolution.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Cleaning Solution</a> has grown into a reputable six figure company and
recorded 6 years of consecutive growth. </p>
<p>As a serial entrepreneur however, I have always been
brainstorming new business ideas in the meantime. I wanted to start a company
that could make a huge difference in the world. One that could impact not just
the local community like my cleaning company, but help everyone everywhere. </p>
<p>I have always been into fashion, and we all know that
clothing is obviously a necessity. Everyone needs a shirt on their back. Why
not buy one that is going to make a difference? Why not buy a shirt that means
something more? One that will motivate you to bring out your best every single
day. One that will create jobs for your community by funding young startups.
One that will help young entrepreneurs stay motivated to keep pushing forward and realize that
there is always hope in getting their business dreams off the ground through
hard work and perseverance....Trep Wear was born. </p>
<p><b>Our Mission</b></p>
<p>Trep Wear is more than your average T-Shirt brand. Trep Wear
is a lifestyle brand. In a world full of fear and doubt, we all need that extra
motivation to keep pushing forward when times get tough. To be a part of the
Trep Wear family means to be a dreamer, an over-achiever, a do-er. Trep Wear isn't
just for entrepreneurs, it’s for those who want more out of life and want to
make a difference in the world at the same time. For those who want to take
control of life, instead of letting life control you. One shirt at a time, we
can make a difference not only in our local communities, but in the entire
world around us. That is Trep Wear. </p>
<p>Our goal is to help fund at least 50
young entrepreneurs every year through the sales of our stylish, motivational
shirts and accessories. </p>
<p>How are we going to accomplish this? </p>
<p>For every single item that Trep Wear sells, $5 is held
back in our startup fund. Once the startup fund hits the $5,000 mark, we write
a $5,000 check to a young entrepreneur ready to take their business idea from a
dream to reality. We are also partnering with B2B services such as designers,
printers, etc., to help these donations stretch even further for the
entrepreneur. The $5,000 donations will actually be upwards of $8,000 in value
to the recipient.</p>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>There are a few reasons why it is important for us to use
a crowdfunding campaign for Trep Wear, over securing our own funding elsewhere.
Our funding goal is set at $10,000. Where is this money going?</p>
<p></p><ul>

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">With your funding up front, we can jumpstart our

Can I take it through airport security?Every effort has been made to conform to the safety parameters set out by the Civil Aviation Authority.
The batteries within the XOO Belt are certified by the manufacturer as ultra safe, being highly resistant to high temperatures, electrical damage, physical impact and even cutting and piercing.
However, as this is a new and innovative piece of technology, we cannot guarantee that all airlines will allow passengers to travel with the XOO Belt and we therefore recommend consulting your airline carrier before travelling with the item.

How do I charge the belt?The belt comes with a microUSB port built into the buckle and charges in the same way as your mobile devices—plugged into the wall with a USB-wall adaptor.
The low-profile USB-to-microUSB adaptor used to charge devices from the belt can also be taken out, turned around and used to charge the belt from a computer.
How long will it take to charge the belt?It takes approximately 3 hours to charge the belt via a USB port.
How long will it take to charge my phone?The belt transfers its entire 2,100mAh charge in around 3 hours but the time taken to charge a phone—which depends on the size of your phone’s battery—will vary.
An iPhone 6 for instance (with a 1,810mAh battery) will usually take just over 2 and a half hours to fully charge from empty.
Does it work with Apple devices?It requires a microUSB-to-Lightning adaptor add-on—we’re supplying official MFi certified adaptors to backers free with the belt.Technical dimensions?The buckle: 39mm x 86mm x 18mmThe belt: 35mm x 4mm-2mm (it has feathered edges) x 750mm–1,100mm (depending on size chosen).",27.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>The Long Story</h2>
</div>
<div>
	Hey! I'm Mattias, a 210 cm (6'11"") tall guy from Sweden that is tired of buying too short clothing.
</div>
<br/><div>	
	People taller than 190 cm (6’3”) have a problem finding a standard t-shirt with OK width and good length. Furthermore a lot of people - regardless of height - like their t-shirts and sweaters to be longer than average and still with a great fit.
	<br/>
	It's almost impossible to find.
</div>
<br/><div>
	So Long Sven was born to solve these problems. I have already been to India visiting fabric markets, looking for manufacturers, label makers, zipper suppliers and more. Now, it's time to make it all happen.
</div>
<br/><div>
<h3>The Collection</h3>

</div></div>","The Long Story


	Hey! I'm Mattias, a 210 cm (6'11"") tall guy from Sweden that is tired of buying too short clothing.

	
	People taller than 190 cm (6’3”) have a problem finding a standard t-shirt with OK width and good length. Furthermore a lot of people - regardless of height - like their t-shirts and sweaters to be longer than average and still with a great fit.
	
	It's almost impossible to find.


	So Long Sven was born to solve these problems. I have already been to India visiting fabric markets, looking for manufacturers, label makers, zipper suppliers and more. Now, it's time to make it all happen.


The Collection

		The first collection of extra long clothing will consist of 2 types of t-shirts, a tank top (or singlet), a sweatshirt and a hoodie. It's pretty standard stuff, but the unique thing is the length and the fit!	
		
			For example:
			The average size M is 73 cm long. 
			So Long Sven size M is 81 cm long. And that's not even the longest model. Winning!

<p>Höst Studios was founded in 2014 by Swedish designer Marie Simcikova, <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">based in the inspiring city of Barcelona. </span></p>
<p>Our goal is to create innovative yet timeless fashion that can be used for <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">every day wear.

<p>Our most important mantra at Höst Studios is that ""All you Need is Less” and therefor we don't aim to be part of the ""fast fashion"" industry, instead Höst intends to maintain a sustainable approach wherever possible and truly be a ""slow fashion"" brand.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Another of our goals is to create minimalist designs, creating a </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">strong look and making it easy to mix garments to create individual styles.</span></p>

INTRODUCING HÖST


Höst Studios was founded in 2014 by Swedish designer Marie Simcikova, based in the inspiring city of Barcelona. 
Our goal is to create innovative yet timeless fashion that can be used for every day wear. We want our clothes to be practical and comfortable, whilst making the girl who is wearing them feel unique and authentic.
Our most important mantra at Höst Studios is that ""All you Need is Less” and therefor we don't aim to be part of the ""fast fashion"" industry, instead Höst intends to maintain a sustainable approach wherever possible and truly be a ""slow fashion"" brand.
Another of our goals is to create minimalist designs, creating a strong look and making it easy to mix garments to create individual styles.



RAINY DAYS
For this autumn 2015, we want you to experience the rain as something fun, whether it’s splashing in the puddles outside or from the comfort of your home. 




To achieve this we have used some of the finest and innovative materials such as a ultra soft bamboo jersey knit to wear at home complimented by a translucent frosted fabric for the raincoats.




By playing around with these fabrics and combining them in different ways we have created a fun and innovative collection that will make you experience the Rain as something exciting and fun.



INSPIRATION

The rainy days collection stays true to its name and the rain has a strong presence in our designs – recognizable in the collections pattern shapes, color variations and prints.




QUALITY & MATERIALS


We have taken pride in making sure that the fabrics we chose for our designs are of a high standard of quality and durability. 
The materials are innovative, soft to touch and a pleasure to wear.






ADDING TO SUSTAINABILITY

We have sourced our materials from smaller suppliers, supporting communities that have sustainability in mind.
For this season, our materials come from two smaller suppliers that have these values in mind.
Our bamboo knit is certified by OEKOTEK 100 as being free from harmful chemicals and our plastic is made out of polyurethane.
By doing this, and working with a small production line we take great pride in what is Höst’s strong identity.


WHAT THE MONEY WILL BE USED FOR

1. Fulfill fabric orders
2. Production of a small collection in Barcelona
3. Trimmings, collection photography and Talent

IF WE EXCEED OUR GOAL

All funds that exceed our goal wil be re-invested in further expansion of Höst.
We will use these to Expand Marketing reach and fund our next collection.

IF WE DON'T REACH OUR GOAL

If we don’t reach our goal, we will reduce our estimated production size so that we can fulfill our pre-orders and still offer a smaller stock this autumn.

<p>Hello my name is Bradley Scott, I am owner and designer at B25 by Dtrk. I create unique one-of-a-kind garments that can be worn day into night. With my love of simplicity, asymmetrical design and leather detail; incorporated into the most easy wearing, well constructed garments. I don't consider myself as a trendsetter, but rather a designer that creates unique designs year round.  YES! I have a dream and a strategy in mind that will not fade. I am here to stay!</p>
<p>I am not just a designer whom just shows his collection quickly just to get a reaction. I am an exclusive designer who shows collections at charitable Fashion shows that will make a difference in others lives. In the last year I have committed myself in raising charitable funds with my collection. This includes, Sickle Cell and Cancer Foundations. I'd love to continue to benefit wonderful foundations with the construction of my new line, but I've attempted to fund this new collection myself from materials, pattern-making and final sample, but it has translated into higher costs requiring me to seek additional funding. For this reason, I am seeking your generous spirit and light to assist me with these achievable tasks to show at NYC fashion week in September and charitable fashion shows! You will be helping with the production of the line and backing B25 on the journey into the future.<strong> <br/></strong></p>

<h3>B25(Elizabethan Cipher, Brad)</h3>
<h3>Dtrk(Deitterick)</h3>
<h2><strong>About Bradley Scott Deitterick (B25 by Dtrk)</strong></h2>
<p><span class=""font_7"">Born in a rural town called Catawissa, PA. A New York-based Fashion Designer. He achieved designing fashion apparel after a vision he acquired from the loss of his father, George, taken by Colon Cancer in 2004. In 2010 he decided to go out on his own and launch his RTW Women's brand, B25 by Dtrk. The line consists of cutting-edge, effortless blended of textures, minimalist and tailored with a precise attention to detail. </span></p>
<p>Having graduated from the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale in fashion design in '09, Bradley decided to make his way again to NYC to strengthen his technique and acquire a deep knowledge of the women's RTW fashion market and its dynamic. <span class=""font_7"">He encountered his aesthetic succeeding his research of the market and studying to master his tailoring skills. The B25 by Dtrk collection is a true reflection of the background of its designer.</span></p>
<p><span class=""font_7"">He draws inspiration for his lines from everything and everywhere: architecture, NYC, and industrial elements from home state of Pennsylvania.</span><span class=""font_7""> His work is an examination of innovative construction and imparts a feminine spirit with an edgy emphasis.</span></p>

I am an exclusive designer who shows collections at charitable Fashion shows that will make a difference in others lives. In the last year I have committed myself in raising charitable funds with my collection. This includes, Sickle Cell and Cancer Foundations. I'd love to continue to benefit wonderful foundations with the construction of my new line, but I've attempted to fund this new collection myself from materials, pattern-making and final sample, but it has translated into higher costs requiring me to seek additional funding. For this reason, I am seeking your generous spirit and light to assist me with these achievable tasks to show at NYC fashion week in September and charitable fashion shows! You will be helping with the production of the line and backing B25 on the journey into the future.

B25(Elizabethan Cipher, Brad)
Dtrk(Deitterick)
About Bradley Scott Deitterick (B25 by Dtrk)
Born in a rural town called Catawissa, PA. A New York-based Fashion Designer. He achieved designing fashion apparel after a vision he acquired from the loss of his father, George, taken by Colon Cancer in 2004. In 2010 he decided to go out on his own and launch his RTW Women's brand, B25 by Dtrk. The line consists of cutting-edge, effortless blended of textures, minimalist and tailored with a precise attention to detail. 
Having graduated from the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale in fashion design in '09, Bradley decided to make his way again to NYC to strengthen his technique and acquire a deep knowledge of the women's RTW fashion market and its dynamic. He encountered his aesthetic succeeding his research of the market and studying to master his tailoring skills. The B25 by Dtrk collection is a true reflection of the background of its designer.
He draws inspiration for his lines from everything and everywhere: architecture, NYC, and industrial elements from home state of Pennsylvania. His work is an examination of innovative construction and imparts a feminine spirit with an edgy emphasis.

About Tanya Theberge

Some people are born to create. This rings especially true for Tanya. Just ask her parents, who have supported, and sometimes endured, Tanya’s endless creative projects around the house since she was old enough to put crayon to paper.
Tanya’s first foray in design education was at the Alberta College of Art and Design. It was during this time in her life that she gave birth to her first son. Being a single mother at that time, she made the difficult decision to put her schooling on hold. She vowed to complete her studies when her son was old enough to start grade school. She made good on that vow, but soon found herself at another crucial junction three years into her undergrad. 
Tanya’s bespoke swimwear business started in 2008. Through social media referrals, the business grew beyond what she could manage while being a full time student and mother. Once again, a difficult decision was in front of her, finish her undergraduate degree or focus on the business. The business won out.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">ORIGIN OF ANTIKYTHERAWATCHES NAME'S</h3>
<p>The Antikythera name comes from a Greek island where in October of 1900 a sunken wreck was found. The date of the wreck dates back in about 50 BC. Within this wreck was found an object that only in 1952 was understood to be an incredible and complex mechanism to become one of the 10 most mysterious objects in the world. </p>

<p>it's nice to be able to see how certain things can have a mutual attraction, so love is born between people, people and animals or simply for things. Cristina Zenato, an underwater expert who has lived in the Bahamas for so many years, has devoted a great deal of her life to achieving perfection in her relationship with ""her"" sharks. Passion and love two elements that help you win many battles. Antikythera has worked 2 years to realize its new product and as it is wanted to happen, Antikythera has dedicated the product to the DAMA of the SEA CRISTINA ZENATO which has accepted and signed the new creation in his honor. Passion and mutual love. Life stories and SEA DAME is born</p>

<h3>IVEGLIA 1579 was born...</h3>
<p>In 1579 the plague was again in Europe and so in Spain so that on October 28 the Santo Spirito galleon, better known as Iveglia by the name of the commander, was forbidden to moor in Genoa. Left in the sea and sailing along the coast, the ship reached the Portofino Promontory and was shipwrecked ending up on the rocks, not being able to oppose the force of the sea and the strong wind. Very probably years later, given the shallow waters in which the ship had rested, part of the cargo was also recovered by the local inhabitants.</p>
<p>October 28, 2019, exactly 440 years later. the IVEGLIA galleon wants to be remembered with this commemorative watch ... IVEGLIA rises again</p>

<h3>Our Design</h3>
<p>Every detail of the ANTIKYTHERA IVEGLIA &amp; SEA DAME project started with a series of hand-drawn sketches. We found the solution to define the rule for divers. We focused on simplifying all the complexity of the product, giving a clean and modern look that is now the core of the ANTIKYTHERA brand. After getting feedback on our concepts from a number of designers and business associates (people we knew would be interested in our product), our designs went through various revisions and were optimized so that they could be converted into drawings CAD.</p>

<h3>BEZEL anti clockwise</h3>
<p><strong>STANDARD  TIMER SCUBA BEZEL VS ANTIKYTHERA COUNTDOWN SCUBA BEZEL</strong></p>
<p>Look at the BEZEL crown of the Antikythera watch. The minutes are positioned in anti-clockwise sense. In the 1980s, the arrival of dive computers began to exclude the use of clocks and depth gauges from dive planning. Furthermore, the lack of a fixed reference in the bezel or dial as a memory for the end of the planned dive time is now considered an error. The concept of Countdown is much more useful, that is the count of the remaining time. The reasoning seems the same but in the first case ""TIMER"" we do not have a reference of the remaining time while the second case with the ""COUNTDOWN"" bezel, we establish the time we have to use and setting it at the minute hand when it reaches the reference ZERO, it knows that time has come to an end. It is important to take into consideration the risk of recent memory loss and overcome this problem with the help of an appropriate tool. Antikytherawatches and among the very rare tools that use this system.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE TO ALL DIVERS.</strong></p>
<p>This detail UNIQUE FOR THE ANTIKYTHERA WATCH IS the real evolution and consideration that today must be done to plan dives or breathe decompression gas without the risk of errors caused by our memory. THIS IS WRONG ... never working trusting in our memory. WE MUST HAVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HELP US IN PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT OF THE DIVE. Towards the end of a technical dive, to breathe a special gas to follow a safety decompression, only for time management, tables and a redundant electronic instrumentation must be used...  but above all it is ""FORBIDDEN"" to use our weak (immersed) memory. Just for example, imagine the pilots of airplanes, whether they are single-engine or jet pilots, never start up (starting) an aircraft using their memory to follow standard procedure, but use a checklist to follow step by step .. they are 4 pages of instructions but even after 5000 hours of flight and experience, nobody wants or thinks they should memorize them. There must be a reason!!</p>

Even today, the only thing visible is his anchor, half-buried on a sandy bottom of 42 meters (138 ft), from which only part of the anchor appears. This is why IVEGLIA 1579 (with PVD case and brushed steel case).  </p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">We have chosen a manufacturing company based in Northern Italy, the choice is made based on its experience, it is now a historic company in the design and realization of watches for over 50 years, so great professionalism and reliability. Another very important detail to ensure a complete and complete cycle of the project is that the company is equipped to handle large production lines. Another not uncommon fact is that the company headquarters are just 200 kilometers from our studio so this proximity was important because it allowed us to oversee the production of the Antikythera watch product line. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks and challenges <br/>This project is the result of over 35 years' experience in diving passion with my natural aptitude for analytical observation and the desire to find solutions to problems. <br/>For the first 30 years of my professional life I successfully conquered and managed a scubadiving equipment distribution company, where I implemented my management and innovation capabilities on a daily basis. <br/>I have opened up new markets in Europe in the field of the distribution of underwater equipment and, thanks to a very competent and efficient team, have had a recognizable success. <br/>In 2003 I decided to sell my ongoing business to dedicate my time and energy to what has always been my true passion: the sea and the sky. <br/>Unfortunately (or fortunately!) My observation powers and the pleasure of seeking solutions to improving things and situations never left me. <br/>I think FLYREB first and IVEGLIA 1579 after of Antikythera is a great instruments, complete with a wristwatch, with the ability to be an aid for certain computing needs. <br/>Thanks to the experience gained in the aeronautical and underwater industry, together with the collaboration of my colleagues, I am convinced that I can produce an optimal product. <br/>I am aware of the problems of production and assembly and I can confidently say that the supporters of this project will certainly not be disappointed. <br/>This edition we have add also a new watch using our Ambassador CRISTINA ZENATO, SEA DAME with Cristina signature inside. Cristina has dedicated to life time to exploration, education and conservation. <br/>A recognized diving professional for the last twenty-four years, Cristina ZENATO shares her knowledge about oceans, sharks, caves and scuba diving. Cristina is a proud member of the Women Divers Hall of Fame, The Explorers Club, the Ocean Artists Society and a Platinum Pro5000 recipient. <br/>The photos above are of the prototype for the ANTIKYTHERA. There may be small changes made to the watch for the final production.</p>

The Antikythera name comes from a Greek island where in October of 1900 a sunken wreck was found. The date of the wreck dates back in about 50 BC. Within this wreck was found an object that only in 1952 was understood to be an incredible and complex mechanism to become one of the 10 most mysterious objects in the world. 
Antikythera, Greek island

it's nice to be able to see how certain things can have a mutual attraction, so love is born between people, people and animals or simply for things. Cristina Zenato, an underwater expert who has lived in the Bahamas for so many years, has devoted a great deal of her life to achieving perfection in her relationship with ""her"" sharks. Passion and love two elements that help you win many battles. Antikythera has worked 2 years to realize its new product and as it is wanted to happen, Antikythera has dedicated the product to the DAMA of the SEA CRISTINA ZENATO which has accepted and signed the new creation in his honor. Passion and mutual love. Life stories and SEA DAME is born

IVEGLIA 1579 was born...
In 1579 the plague was again in Europe and so in Spain so that on October 28 the Santo Spirito galleon, better known as Iveglia by the name of the commander, was forbidden to moor in Genoa. Left in the sea and sailing along the coast, the ship reached the Portofino Promontory and was shipwrecked ending up on the rocks, not being able to oppose the force of the sea and the strong wind. Very probably years later, given the shallow waters in which the ship had rested, part of the cargo was also recovered by the local inhabitants.
October 28, 2019, exactly 440 years later. the IVEGLIA galleon wants to be remembered with this commemorative watch ... IVEGLIA rises again

 
Our Design
Every detail of the ANTIKYTHERA IVEGLIA & SEA DAME project started with a series of hand-drawn sketches. We found the solution to define the rule for divers. We focused on simplifying all the complexity of the product, giving a clean and modern look that is now the core of the ANTIKYTHERA brand. After getting feedback on our concepts from a number of designers and business associates (people we knew would be interested in our product), our designs went through various revisions and were optimized so that they could be converted into drawings CAD.








BEZEL anti clockwise
STANDARD  TIMER SCUBA BEZEL VS ANTIKYTHERA COUNTDOWN SCUBA BEZEL
Look at the BEZEL crown of the Antikythera watch. The minutes are positioned in anti-clockwise sense. In the 1980s, the arrival of dive computers began to exclude the use of clocks and depth gauges from dive planning. Furthermore, the lack of a fixed reference in the bezel or dial as a memory for the end of the planned dive time is now considered an error. The concept of Countdown is much more useful, that is the count of the remaining time. The reasoning seems the same but in the first case ""TIMER"" we do not have a reference of the remaining time while the second case with the ""COUNTDOWN"" bezel, we establish the time we have to use and setting it at the minute hand when it reaches the reference ZERO, it knows that time has come to an end. It is important to take into consideration the risk of recent memory loss and overcome this problem with the help of an appropriate tool. Antikytherawatches and among the very rare tools that use this system.
NOTE TO ALL DIVERS.
This detail UNIQUE FOR THE ANTIKYTHERA WATCH IS the real evolution and consideration that today must be done to plan dives or breathe decompression gas without the risk of errors caused by our memory. THIS IS WRONG ... never working trusting in our memory. WE MUST HAVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HELP US IN PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT OF THE DIVE. Towards the end of a technical dive, to breathe a special gas to follow a safety decompression, only for time management, tables and a redundant electronic instrumentation must be used...  but above all it is ""FORBIDDEN"" to use our weak (immersed) memory. Just for example, imagine the pilots of airplanes, whether they are single-engine or jet pilots, never start up (starting) an aircraft using their memory to follow standard procedure, but use a checklist to follow step by step .. they are 4 pages of instructions but even after 5000 hours of flight and experience, nobody wants or thinks they should memorize them. There must be a reason!!

IVEGLIA 1579 - SEA DAME - Cristina Zenato
 
CRISTINA ZENATO LA DAMA DEL MARE / SEA DAME
It's nice to be able to see how certain things can have a mutual attraction, so love is born between people, people and animals or simply for things. Crsitina Zenato, an underwater expert who has lived in the Bahamas for so many years, has devoted a great deal of her life to achieving perfection in her relationship with ""her"" sharks. Passion and love two elements that help you win many battles. Antikythera has worked 2 years to realize its new product and as it is wanted to happen, Antikythera has dedicated the product to the DAMA of the SEA CRISTINA ZENATO which has accepted and signed the new creation in his honor. Passion and mutual love. Life stories and SEA DAME is born

2019 COLLECTION
You can choose between 6 models of our collection: we have called them IVEGLIA 1579 In commemoration of the Spanish galleon called Iveglia, sunk on October 27, 1579 in the waters off the promontory of Portofino. Even today, the only thing visible is his anchor, half-buried on a sandy bottom of 42 meters (138 ft), from which only part of the anchor appears. This is why IVEGLIA 1579 (with PVD case and brushed steel case).

PRE-ORDER AVDANTAGES
Reduce costs because we remove rings from a commercial chain. This opportunity is the commercial revolution in order to be able to offer, albeit for a limited time, cutting-edge and current products.
SCUBADIVER RULE CALCULATOR  

Example just fo Tech scuba divers, how to calculate the pressure at the limit of O2Pp 1.4 using a Nitrox 32 (NI) 

 

I° - Collate number 10 on the outer ring with the percentage of mixture you want to calculate in this case 32 as 32% of gas mix  
II° - In the outer ring, in front at the number 14 (1.4 OTU) in the inner ring, you can see the maximum pressure not to exceed 44 ( exactly is 4,375 BAR = 33,75 mt)
 
TRAVELLERS: Exchange Rates Calculator

 I° - Collimate the number you consider ""foreign currency exchange"" (example in YEN) that is on the outer ring with the ""10"" number of the inner ring. In this case 1 US$ = 120 JP YEN (example)  
II° - Do you want to know the equivalent of 85, 850 or 8500 YEN? Look for the ""85"" outer ring and the value is exactly collimated with the number in the inner ring. In this case 850 YEN = 7,08 US$, 8500 YEN = 70,80 US$. (The currency exchange used was invented for example purposes only).
ANTIKYTHERA PRODUCTION
We have chosen a manufacturing company based in Northern Italy, the choice is made based on its experience, it is now a historic company in the design and realization of watches for over 50 years, so great professionalism and reliability. Another very important detail to ensure a complete and complete cycle of the project is that the company is equipped to handle large production lines. Another not uncommon fact is that the company headquarters are just 200 kilometers from our studio so this proximity was important because it allowed us to oversee the production of the Antikythera watch product line.

Risks & Challenges
Risks and challenges This project is the result of over 35 years' experience in diving passion with my natural aptitude for analytical observation and the desire to find solutions to problems. For the first 30 years of my professional life I successfully conquered and managed a scubadiving equipment distribution company, where I implemented my management and innovation capabilities on a daily basis. I have opened up new markets in Europe in the field of the distribution of underwater equipment and, thanks to a very competent and efficient team, have had a recognizable success. In 2003 I decided to sell my ongoing business to dedicate my time and energy to what has always been my true passion: the sea and the sky. Unfortunately (or fortunately!) My observation powers and the pleasure of seeking solutions to improving things and situations never left me. I think FLYREB first and IVEGLIA 1579 after of Antikythera is a great instruments, complete with a wristwatch, with the ability to be an aid for certain computing needs. Thanks to the experience gained in the aeronautical and underwater industry, together with the collaboration of my colleagues, I am convinced that I can produce an optimal product. I am aware of the problems of production and assembly and I can confidently say that the supporters of this project will certainly not be disappointed. This edition we have add also a new watch using our Ambassador CRISTINA ZENATO, SEA DAME with Cristina signature inside. Cristina has dedicated to life time to exploration, education and conservation. A recognized diving professional for the last twenty-four years, Cristina ZENATO shares her knowledge about oceans, sharks, caves and scuba diving. Cristina is a proud member of the Women Divers Hall of Fame, The Explorers Club, the Ocean Artists Society and a Platinum Pro5000 recipient. The photos above are of the prototype for the ANTIKYTHERA. There may be small changes made to the watch for the final production.

This is Giorgio at his finest by bringing his Formula 1 inspirations into a watch that embodies the aesthetics and the engineering that define this sport. Also, this is Giorgio's most personal watch creation as each timepiece will have one of his drawing engraved on the back, making each one an individual and collectible item. Furthermore, Giorgio's dream was to make this watch affordable to all racing fans, despite their budget and without sacrificing in quality. In this sense,  thanks to Kickstarter funding and a direct-to-customer distribution strategy the cost of these watches will be extremely competitive compared to other offerings currently in the watch market.

A career spent meticulously drafting the most transcendent engineering, of the best racing machine, has given Giorgio an invaluable education on enduring design, evidenced by this new venture that so eloquently conveys the precision, passion and performance necessary for success at the pinnacle of motorsportLimited Edition G5 Swiss Chrono As Giorgio states: ""There are a lot of parallels between the world of car racing and the world of watches. Both, are based in mechanical engineering, performance and beauty. My career covering Formula 1 and my love for watches has inspired me to translate the passion of racing into a timepiece. I want to give my followers and all of those who love motorsport the opportunity to have a watch that reflects the precision, excitement and beauty that made them fans of Formula 1.   The Giorgio Piola brand was launched in 2017 with three limited edition models. Since then, the brand has expanded to two collections, several sub-collections and almost 25 models that cover quartz and mechanical timepieces that are consistent with Giorgio's vision of bringing the spirit of racing into watchmaking.Sample of existing Giorgio Piola watch collectionMovements for the Giorgio Piola G5 Chrono MovementGiorgio Piola G5 movement and caseAt Giorgio Piola's website you can discover what Giorgio has been up to in his quest for the perfect racing watch.   What started as a bet between two brothers and gave Giorgio a career in Formula 1, also brought his skills to watches and culminated with the SHIFT Collection. This is Giorgio at his finest by bringing his Formula 1 inspirations into a watch that embodies the aesthetics and the engineering that define this sport. Also, this is Giorgio's most personal watch creation as each timepiece will have one of his drawing engraved on the back, making each one an individual and collectible item. Furthermore, Giorgio's dream was to make this watch affordable to all racing fans, despite their budget and without sacrificing in quality. In this sense,  thanks to Kickstarter funding and a direct-to-customer distribution strategy the cost of these watches will be extremely competitive compared to other offerings currently in the watch market. Here is where your pledge becomes essential and will make a difference: it will allow for better production planning and cost negotiations with suppliers which will translate into a more affordable timepiece that can be enjoyed by many racing fans throughout the world!Black SHIFTBlack SHIFTBlack SHIFTBack of Black SHIFTBlue SHIFTBlue SHIFTBlue SHIFTBack of Blue SHIFTRed SHIFTRed SHIFTRed SHIFTBack of Red SHIFTGreen SHIFTGreen SHIFTGreen SHIFTBack of Green SHIFTBlack SHIFTBlue SHIFTGreen SHIFTRed SHIFTBlack SHIFTBlue SHIFTGreen SHIFTRed SHIFT  Case diameter: 46.5mmCase thickness: 15.0mmOpening: 37.0mmTotal watch length (including strap): 250.0mm with buckleStrap width at lugs: 22.0mmBuckle width: inner width 22.0mm, outer width 29.9mmWatch weight: 150 g   It is well regarded that Swiss Made watches are the pinnacle of horological excellence. The customized base movement in the SHIFT watches is produced by Ronda AG based in Lausen, Basel-Landschaft.The company dates back to 1946. Movements manufactured by Ronda have been and are at the heart of some of the most illustrious brands in Swiss watchmaking. Beyond the precision, intelligence and detail needed to manufacture watches at this level of consistency and quality is a dedication to preserving a historical legacy of timekeeping excellence that stretches back over 200 year. Year after year the Swiss Watch Industry sets new standards of excellence and storied brands continue to produce timepieces that are historical milestones in this fascinating craft blending metallurgy, physics, style, ergonomics and design.By managing minute tolerances and creating standards of performance reliability – it is not without great care and consideration that the Swiss Made label is used. The SHIFT is assembled with absolute care, by hand, in Switzerland to deliver the exhilaration and an emotional resonance while still being utterly durable and dependable The SHIFT collection was born in Italy from the mind of Giorgio Piola, but Made in Switzerland and to be worn globally.

</div></div>","As seen in  The Gadget Flow--FeatureEIN Priess Wire Examiner.com The Uni Charge Universal Charging Station offers consumers an unparalleled solution to charge any brand smartphone, tablet, e-reader or wearable device with a single powerful unit!  The Uni Charge is a unique and comprehensive charging solution with a sharp attractive design. 
The Uni Charge works with the latest iDevices (iPhone 6 and 5, iPad, iPod touch), Android and Windows devices such as phones, tablets & e-readers from various manufacturers (Samsung, Google, Nokia, Amazon, LG, Motorola, HTC, Sony) and many more micro USB-based charging devices.



One year ago we ventured out to create a solution for charging various smartphones and wearable
devices, eliminating the need for multiple cables. Today, we are excited to announce that the Uni Charge allows you to charge almost any smartphone, tablet, e-reader, smart watch, fitness tracker, and even some heart rate monitors, all
in one station!

Uni Charge's unique Connector Selector wheel (Patent in Process)  gives a one stop solution for charging almost any smart device on the market!

Plug in the micro USB cable
Rotate the wheel to select the connector for your device: Apple, Samsung, Google, Amazon, Nokia, LG, HTC, Motorola, Sony or any brand name device that has a micro USB connector for charging

Insert the device in the connector and start charging

Working Prototype 
Stretch Goal 4 ($90,000)
Sliding Connectors on the wheel (Patent in Process) - For devices with a case
We learned valuable input from our prototype users.  With their input we have already made some changes to the Uni Charge and Uni Charge Plus by removing the back rest and adding a sliding support to easily fit into a pocket or handbag.
We also understood that most smartphone and tablet users have a case and a common complaint is that the case must be removed in order to dock/charge on their existing docking stations. 
With this input we have already designed and made a few working prototypes with our sliding/floating connector (Patent in Process) to allow easy charging for devices with cases. This unique Patent in Process design sets us apart from rest of the charging/docking stations on the market.








Uni Charge and Uni Charge Plus will accommodate almost all phones and tablets with a case up to 2.5mm thick. 
 Note: It is not possible to accommodate all types of cases as there is no governing standard for case thickness amongst various manufacturers.
Time Line
Campaign End -- Early Jan 2015

Assembling and shipping of Uni Charge -- April 2015
Lab tests and certifications for Uni Charge Plus -- Feb and Mar 2015

Hola from Guatemala! 

We have some exciting news to share with you - Rachel and Averie are starting an ethical apparel brand based in Guatemala! A few months ago we went on a walk along beautiful Lake Atitlán and started dreaming about our futures and our shared love for the artisans of Guatemala. We both have backgrounds in design and share a common passion for creating with our hands. After an hour of throwing around ideas and dreaming big - we thought, wait... we can actually do this! So here we go!Together we are creating Casa Flor: Your clothes tell a story.Many people are starting to question the ethics of how their clothes are produced. Unfortunately the convenience of 'fast fashion' is taking advantage of marginalized communities all over the world. It can be a daunting task to determine the origin of your clothes, but we believe it is a necessary step to solving the problem. Through Casa Flor, we promise that you’ll never have to question whether everyone involved in the construction of your clothes has been fairly compensated and honored in the workplace. A core principle of Casa Flor is that we believe your clothes tell a story. Our goal is to create clothes that speak of creativity and dignity from the beginning. Over the past few months we have been brainstorming, researching and reaching out to our mentors for guidance. There is a beautiful community of creators who are equally passionate about empowering artisans and creating ethically-made products and we feel extremely supported in this endeavor.Meet the TeamRachel brings textile design (hand dyeing, weaving, illustration skills), graphic design, and a bold personality to the team. Averie brings apparel design and construction (pattern making, a deep understanding of fit), artisan connections, and a fiscally conservative thought process. It is fitting that we met at a non-profit organization dedicated to working towards the empowerment of indigenous artisans in Guatemala.  It is because of our special relationships with many artisans in the highlands that we want Casa Flor to be based here. Our GoalIn our business plan, we are ready to start making sample garments. We have designed five looks that will be the first launch of Casa Flor- and we need your help! It is our goal to raise $10,000. Here is where the money will go:Create Jobs:


  Embroidery Artisan Wages: $600


  Backstrap Weaving Artisan Wages:
$900


  Footloom Weaving Artisan Wages:
$2,000


  Natural Dye Artisan Wages: $250


  Tailors Wages: $1,000

  Staff: $2,000

Purchase Materials:

  Notions (Zippers, lining, thread,

  Indiegogo perks/Fundraising
materials: $700


Overhead Costs:

  Work Space: $1,000


  Transportation to and from artisan’s
homes: $300


  Online Marketing Costs: $300


Thus far, we have invested our personal income into Casa Flor; but we need your help to really get Casa Flor moving. We very much appreciate your support in creating jobs for the incredible artisans we have met! Our common passions for design and alleviating poverty through employment is the reason we are doing this now and in this beautiful country, Guatemala. How to get Involved

</div>Hi IndieGoGo,<p>Let me introduce the HDDWatch, the watch made from a 1 inch Hard Drive.</p>
<br/><h3>The Genesis of this project</h3>
<p>In September 2013, while reading my favorite French watch forum, I stumbled upon this picture :</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/735220/files/20140722054116-HDDW_01.jpg?1406032876"" src="""" style=""""/></p>This was originally a joke, but it stroke me. This was a GENIUS idea ! This small Hard-Disk-Drive (HDD) was exactly the right size for a watch.<p>It took me about 4 seconds to decide to try to turn this joke into a reality.</p>
<p>I already had some experience with designing and producing watches (see below), so I knew I could do it.</p>
<p>So, the journey started. I first had to find and buy the small HDD. Turned out that the Microdrive is simply perfect for this. Perfect size, and as it was almost killed by the Memory cards, the price was also perfect.</p>
<p>Then, on to designing the case. Using Corel Draw and SolidWorks, I built the case around the size and shape of the HDD plate.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/735264/files/20140722060856-HDDW_04.jpg?1406034536"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The band would be aligned to the axis of the disk. This was for both practical and esthetical reasons.</p>
<div>I then proceeded to making this watch in a 3D software :</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/924215/files/20141012093738-Story_13.jpg?1413131858"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div><br/></div>More than one year after, the result is :</div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/924220/files/20141012093950-Story_21.png?1413131990"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>So, what's this watch ?</h3>
<p><b>Most important thing</b> : This is NOT a smart watch. While it is made from a Hard-Disk Drive, it is nothing more than a watch. You won't be able to use it as a storage. Unless you put a Post-it note on the watch's glass.</p>
<p>So, if the HDDwatches is not a smart watch, what is it ?</p>
<p>Well, it is simply a watch with a fun design that (as far as I Googled it) doesn't exist anywhere else. There are some clocks made out from 2"" or 3"" HDD, but never a wristwatch.</p>
<p>The watch comes with a Band that has a PCB printing on it. The hands have the shape of the reading arm of the HDD.</p>
<p>And the watch is stored into an Antistatic sheet of plastic, and then into a card box.</p>
<p>The watch comes into 2 flavors, for those who wear their watch on their Left or Right wrist. Price is the same for both.</p>
<p>I wanted to keep the design as close to the original MicroDrive HDD, so I chose to put the name of the watch on the back.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/977735/files/20141101135522-DSC_6592-1600.jpg?1414875322"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The size of the watch is 47 x 37 x 8 mm (excluding crown &amp; lugs).</span><br/>
</div>
</div><div><br/></div><div>The watch is available for Right or Left wrist. You can also choose for a classical black leather strap.</div><div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/977744/files/20141101135907-DSCF2318_1200.jpg?1414875547"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">And there are 280 numbered watches (from 21/300 to 300/300. I keep the first 20 for my familly, friends and dog).</span><br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3>Why do I need money ?</h3>
<p>I already have the Microdrives HDD, the straps, the movements, the boxes and the tools to build the watches.</p>
<p>What I need now is to have the watch case produced. Minimum quantity required by the factory to start the machines rolling is 500.</p>
<p>3,500 Euros will allow me to get to this minimum order quantity.</p>
<br/><ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why ""Made in France"" ?</h3>
<p>While the cases, hands, bands and boxes are made in Shenzhen, China, I wanted to build the watches myself. Not because it would be cheaper (on the contrary), but because I want to put a little part of my soul into each watch. Don't worry, I've got a large amount of soul, so I shouldn't run short of it.</p>
<p>So, the disassembly of the Microdrives, and the assembly of the HDDwatches are made by myself in Paris.  In case of a large amount of order, I'll probably ask for some helping hands, but still in Paris.</p>
<br/>

La vidéo de présentation en Français :


Hi IndieGoGo,Let me introduce the HDDWatch, the watch made from a 1 inch Hard Drive.
The Genesis of this project
In September 2013, while reading my favorite French watch forum, I stumbled upon this picture :

This was originally a joke, but it stroke me. This was a GENIUS idea ! This small Hard-Disk-Drive (HDD) was exactly the right size for a watch.It took me about 4 seconds to decide to try to turn this joke into a reality.
I already had some experience with designing and producing watches (see below), so I knew I could do it.
So, the journey started. I first had to find and buy the small HDD. Turned out that the Microdrive is simply perfect for this. Perfect size, and as it was almost killed by the Memory cards, the price was also perfect.
Then, on to designing the case. Using Corel Draw and SolidWorks, I built the case around the size and shape of the HDD plate.


The band would be aligned to the axis of the disk. This was for both practical and esthetical reasons.
I then proceeded to making this watch in a 3D software :

More than one year after, the result is :



So, what's this watch ?
Most important thing : This is NOT a smart watch. While it is made from a Hard-Disk Drive, it is nothing more than a watch. You won't be able to use it as a storage. Unless you put a Post-it note on the watch's glass.
So, if the HDDwatches is not a smart watch, what is it ?
Well, it is simply a watch with a fun design that (as far as I Googled it) doesn't exist anywhere else. There are some clocks made out from 2"" or 3"" HDD, but never a wristwatch.
The watch comes with a Band that has a PCB printing on it. The hands have the shape of the reading arm of the HDD.
And the watch is stored into an Antistatic sheet of plastic, and then into a card box.
The watch comes into 2 flavors, for those who wear their watch on their Left or Right wrist. Price is the same for both.
I wanted to keep the design as close to the original MicroDrive HDD, so I chose to put the name of the watch on the back.




The size of the watch is 47 x 37 x 8 mm (excluding crown & lugs).

The watch is available for Right or Left wrist. You can also choose for a classical black leather strap.


And there are 280 numbered watches (from 21/300 to 300/300. I keep the first 20 for my familly, friends and dog).

Why do I need money ?
I already have the Microdrives HDD, the straps, the movements, the boxes and the tools to build the watches.

Why I need your help
The HDDWatches are almost done.  I already bought :

500 MicroDrives

500 Miyota GL20 quartz movements

1000 sets of Hands (Hour + Minute)
1000 Bands
500 boxes
The mold for the watch case
The first 20 watch cases

All the tools to assemble the watches


I've already build the first 10 watches, to be sure that I can do it.



So, what's missing are the watch cases. I need to buy at least 500 pieces before the factory in China can start production.The case is made out of Stainless Steel (front, back, crown).
So, 3,500 Euros is between 30 and 40 buyers. This low amount allows me to be confident that the project will be a success.


Strech Goal 22,000 €
By popular demand, here are the strech goals for the 22,000 € mark.

Some people told me that, as the disk was without any hour marks, time-reading was difficult if you are not used to empty dials.So, I'm pleased to add this strech goal.  The dials will be engraved for each hour.
You'll be able to choose between the little circles or the rectangles :


It might be possible to offer other options for the engraving of the dial.Add 35 € for the engraving.
Please note that this option is NOT possible for the watches that were already sent. (Unless you are OK to pay for the shipping back & forth. In this case, please contact me directly)



Who am I ?
I'm Jean Jérôme, from Paris. I love watches, and I love designing original watches.
I already designed and produced 3 watch projects :
The Origami Watch Company   



(time on picture is 11:35)
The Prague Jewish Clock


This watch is the replica of a Jewish Clock that is located in Prague, Czech Republlic. The movement turns backwards, like the original clock.

The Handless Minute Repeater (not for sale)
Using a Minute Repeater pocket watch, I had the movement transplanted into a wristwatch. And as the time can be tell by activating the repeater, I had the hands removed.



What's next ?
If this projects succeeds, the next steps are to have a ""Portrait"" version of this watch :

(this is a 3D-printed prototype without the dial).
Another option is to use a mechanical movement : the ETA/Peseux 7001.


This movement is the only one thin enough to fit in my watch.



Campaign timeline

October : Received the first lot of Microdricvee and designed the watch case and strap.
December : Found the company that will make the parts (case, strap, hands, movement)
June 2014 : Received the first set of pre-production pieces. Build up the first watches, check that everything is working fine.
October : Received the watch bands, hands, movements.
November : Ready for the IndieGoGo campaign
December : first watches start shipping (early December)
October 2015 : The HDDwatch with a mechanical movement (?)


How can you help ?
You may not fancy my watch, but you may know someone who would ? Please share the information. Let him/her know about this IndieGoGo campaign.
You know a geek who likes watches ? Can you think of a better gift than the HDDwatch ?
Spread the word, share this campaign to your network (and real-life) friends
I also need your help to tell me how to improve this watch.  Tell me what you'd like to have.  Tell me what you like, what you don't like, and what you'd like to have changed.  I'll see if it's possible.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>“I grew up a shy, timid Native girl, not having the best childhood experience with so much external negativity due to who I was, right down to the colour of my skin. I've since realized that I didn't have to be who I was expected to be, and I could be whoever I wanted! So, I did it!”</i></p>
<p>Devon recognized a common problem based on her own personal experiences and those of her friends, family and other Native women around her. She recognized the need for change, and started looking for a way to help other woman and girls, to tell them that it's okay to be amazing and pursue their passions. And so, SheNative was born. Devon recognized that changing the way Native women perceive themselves will start a chain reaction of empowerment, encouraging these women to provoke a positive change in public perceptions.</p>
<p><b>Why are we Crowdfunding?</b></p>
<p>Devon has been busy building SheNative from the ground up for over 2 years. She's written and refined business plans, raised funds through business competitions, designed and produced the first run of handbags, and so much more. Now, SheNative needs to bring the production of our handbags back home to Saskatoon! By doing this, we are able to hire a small production team of Indigenous women, creating meaningful employment opportunities for them. Once we are able to nail down the production process, we can then focus on the true goal: utilizing our success as a platform to spread the message and kick start this cause.</p>
<h3>Goals</h3> <p>Our dream goal is to reach $100,000! This is what we need to bring the production team on and keep them gainfully employed. We are however, realistic. So, we've broken down our goals for the campaign to show what we can do if we reach certain goals:<br/></p>

<div> </div>
<div>Here's the story: I just completed a successful campaign on that other crowdfunding site (I won't mention any names), and I am <em>endlessly</em> grateful for all the support I receieved! Due to additional requests and needs that are detailed below, I've launched Part II here on Indiegogo. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>First, while I was able to raise enough money to order my first batch of Juneberry Bags, there are other integral aspects of the business I still need to raise money for: </div>
<div> </div>
<div>-Creating a functional web site where people can purchase the bags</div>
<div> </div>
<div>-Marketing my product beyond these fantastic crowdfunding sites</div>
<div> </div>
<div>-Starting the designs for the next five Juneberry Bags covers!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Second, several people have asked me where they can buy a Juneberry Bag now that the other campaign is over. Since I can't take orders through my web site yet, this is a way people can still pre-order the bag for less than what it will cost at retail price. It's a great deal!
<h3><strong>So what makes this bag special? Take a look and see…</strong></h3>
Ever since I can remember, I’ve loved having <em>options</em>. I adore things that are multi-purpose, unique and versatile. Take, for example, a purse: Sometimes you want to carry the bag on your shoulder; sometimes you want to carry it on your back. Sometimes you want a bag with subdued colors, other times you want to match your purse to a pair of rockin’ green pants! So why can’t you have all these things in one bag? 
<p>You can. </p>
<p>Born from my personal need for variety, the Juneberry Bag is probably the most versatile bag you’ll ever own. The Juneberry Bag allows you to easily zip on and off new patterns, from one original cover to the next, creating an infinite number of looks (including personalized covers—see below for details). The covers are all uniquely designed by me, and many of them are nature-inspired.</p>
<p>You can also change the bag's functionality, converting the Juneberry Bag easily from a shoulder bag to a drawstring backpack or to a messenger bag, giving you the opportunity to choose whatever satisfies your preference or matches your activities that day. And it does all this without compromising style. </p>
<h3><strong>The Juneberry Bags in a Nutshell: </strong></h3>
<p>-Easily zip on and off new covers, from one unique pattern to the next. Right now, choose from my five debut patterns. In the future, choose from a large variety of fun patterns, colors, and personalities to match any outfit or mood, all originally designed by me. </p>
<p>-Or, send me <em>your</em> original design or photograph that I will make into a cover. Right now that process is more expensive, but my exciting goal is to offer that option more affordably one day.</p>
<p>-Convert the bag easily from a shoulder bag to a drawstring bag, enabling you to wear it on your back as a backpack. </p>
<p>-Or, convert the purse to a messenger bag, wearing it stylishly on your hip. </p>
<p>-The purse has snaps to close the bag, one inside pocket with a zipper and one without.</p>
<h3> <img alt=""Choose from any of the five debut purse cover patterns!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/598786/pictures/original/20121230104445-Picture_of_all_Purses.png?1356893090"" src="""" style="""" title=""The five debut cover patterns""/>
</h3>
<h3><strong>The fundraising: </strong></h3>
<p>So. Here’s where you come in. As I mentioned above, your pledges will help me pay for the next very necessary steps in this big adventure: Finishing a full web site where people can check out the bags and order them, being able to market my product beyond these super-awesome crowdfunding sites, and allowing me the ability to start designing the next five covers for the Juneberry Bags. And what do you get? The bags for a great low price!! :)</p>
<p>And all of your support also allows me to get closer to creating a way that people can personalize their covers for a reasonable price. That’s right—you send me your picture, drawing, or design, and I make it into a cover for you. Unique, simple, and creative.</p>
<p>So, thanks for reading! I hope you like my purse philosophy, for it’s one of fun, comfort, and versatility! Thank you so much for your support!</p>

</div></div>","Hello! My name is Natalie, creator of the Juneberry Bags. Welcome to my Juneberry Bags, Part II campaign!
 
Here's the story: I just completed a successful campaign on that other crowdfunding site (I won't mention any names), and I am endlessly grateful for all the support I receieved! Due to additional requests and needs that are detailed below, I've launched Part II here on Indiegogo. 
 
First, while I was able to raise enough money to order my first batch of Juneberry Bags, there are other integral aspects of the business I still need to raise money for: 
 
-Creating a functional web site where people can purchase the bags
 
-Marketing my product beyond these fantastic crowdfunding sites
 
-Starting the designs for the next five Juneberry Bags covers!
 
Second, several people have asked me where they can buy a Juneberry Bag now that the other campaign is over. Since I can't take orders through my web site yet, this is a way people can still pre-order the bag for less than what it will cost at retail price. It's a great deal!
So what makes this bag special? Take a look and see…
Ever since I can remember, I’ve loved having options. I adore things that are multi-purpose, unique and versatile. Take, for example, a purse: Sometimes you want to carry the bag on your shoulder; sometimes you want to carry it on your back. Sometimes you want a bag with subdued colors, other times you want to match your purse to a pair of rockin’ green pants! So why can’t you have all these things in one bag? 
You can. 
Born from my personal need for variety, the Juneberry Bag is probably the most versatile bag you’ll ever own. The Juneberry Bag allows you to easily zip on and off new patterns, from one original cover to the next, creating an infinite number of looks (including personalized covers—see below for details). The covers are all uniquely designed by me, and many of them are nature-inspired.
You can also change the bag's functionality, converting the Juneberry Bag easily from a shoulder bag to a drawstring backpack or to a messenger bag, giving you the opportunity to choose whatever satisfies your preference or matches your activities that day. And it does all this without compromising style. 
The Juneberry Bags in a Nutshell: 
-Easily zip on and off new covers, from one unique pattern to the next. Right now, choose from my five debut patterns. In the future, choose from a large variety of fun patterns, colors, and personalities to match any outfit or mood, all originally designed by me. 
-Or, send me your original design or photograph that I will make into a cover. Right now that process is more expensive, but my exciting goal is to offer that option more affordably one day.
-Convert the bag easily from a shoulder bag to a drawstring bag, enabling you to wear it on your back as a backpack. 
-Or, convert the purse to a messenger bag, wearing it stylishly on your hip. 
-The purse has snaps to close the bag, one inside pocket with a zipper and one without.
 

The fundraising: 
So. Here’s where you come in. As I mentioned above, your pledges will help me pay for the next very necessary steps in this big adventure: Finishing a full web site where people can check out the bags and order them, being able to market my product beyond these super-awesome crowdfunding sites, and allowing me the ability to start designing the next five covers for the Juneberry Bags. And what do you get? The bags for a great low price!! :)
And all of your support also allows me to get closer to creating a way that people can personalize their covers for a reasonable price. That’s right—you send me your picture, drawing, or design, and I make it into a cover for you. Unique, simple, and creative.
So, thanks for reading! I hope you like my purse philosophy, for it’s one of fun, comfort, and versatility! Thank you so much for your support!

<p>My name is Alyssa Davis and I am the designer (and one woman circus) behind Skiler Love! I launched my first collection, Bohemian Luxe, in September during BFW. Although I’ve faced some exhilarating challenges in the past few months, this is my most ambitious project to date (eliminate fear of being on camera, check).</p>
<p>To this point, I have been completely self funded, working 45+ hours a week at a desk job and spending almost every ounce of free time designing, creating, planning, and collaborating. A product of the DIY generation, I do everything from designing the products to hand making the jewelry, building my website &amp; online boutique, managing all of the social media platforms, reaching out to other creative individuals to work with, setting up photoshoots and events, and anything else you can possibly think of to build Skiler Love as a brand. But I absolutely love it.</p>
<p>Thank you so much in advance for your support, you have my everlasting gratitude!</p>

<p>Skiler Love is an edgy jewelry line that gives women the chance to wear unique and fun accessories that makes their outfit pop! All of the items I design are handmade by - me - in my home studio in Boston. I tend to think more about quality over quantity and believe it’s important to know that you’re buying locally made jewelry that is never mass produced overseas. I also offer custom sizing and jewelry repair at no extra cost to those who purchase Skiler Love products, as well as eco-friendly packaging materials.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/242/369/33c797ac43ab3ea953e2b4ce0d72caa5_large.png?1351955994"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>Styleweek Northeast is a week long event held in Providence, RI. It gives emerging and established designers the chance to showcase their designs to the public. I applied in the Fall and was recently chosen to be a part of the Accessories Showcase at Styleweek Northeast and the Go Red Challenge (or Red on the Runway), a benefit that pairs a Styleweek Runway designer up with a cancer survivor to model their designs and raise money for a great cause. It all will be held from January 27 – February 2 2013.</p>
<p>Being part of Styleweek means that I will have the chance to show my designs and products to different people in the fashion industry – including stylists, future customers, and buyers -  who may decide to put Skiler Love in local boutique around the Northeast (my main goal for the upcoming year). The online boutique was a great addition this year, but I really would like customers to have the chance to see the jewelry and try it on in person. It's also a great opportunity to get feedback to make our products even better!</p>
<p>A Breakdown of What the Funding Will Go Towards:</p>
<p>$800 Participation fee for Styleweek Northeast</p>
<p>$500 Marketing materials (business cards, lookbooks, banners)</p>
<p>$500 Jewelry supplies</p>
<p>$400 to cover a portion of travel expenses for my intern &amp; I to attend all five days in Providence</p>
<p>$320 Indiegogo &amp; credit card processing fees</p>
<p>$500 Estimated shipping costs to ship rewards</p>
<p>If over $5000 is pledged, I'll create a 6 episode series covering the first year of Skiler Love. That means you'll have access to behind the scenes footage from photoshoots and events, interviews with photographers, models, and designers  we collaborate with and a chance to witness the entire design process. Watch Skiler Love grow and develop into a new brand (a new video every 2 months until January 2014). If we fund over $5000, everyone who pledges $28+ will get a free copy of all 6 episodes emailed to them!  </p>
<p>Any extra profits raised will go towards jewelry supplies and vendor fees so that Skiler Love and come to an event near you!</p>

An African Jewelry Tradition


I started Fulaba to bring authentic Fulani jewelry, handcrafted with precious metals and tell the story to a global market.
Africa has a rich jewelry tradition from countless ethnic groups representing nobility and royalty so we are expanding our collections for the world to know and revere these beautiful designs and its stories.


By backing this campaign you are uplifting women and people of the African diaspora while also helping to develop the finished jewelry industry in West Africa...so often we see just raw materials exported out of Africa causing the value to escape and be captured elsewhere.

<h3>Why ""The Airy Glengarry""?</h3>
<p>I wear a kilt uniform frequently as a competitive bagpiper. Living on the east coast of the United States and competing in the region's Highland Games and Celtic Festivals, I have worn the kilt uniform inclusive of a jacket and a glengarry - the equivalent of  encasing myself in wool - in the height of summer, with the humidity so high one can see the moisture in the air, and often with no shade in sight. This has not only been uncomfortable, but has compromised my performance - all you pipers out there know that perspiration dripping down your face can cause you to lose your seal on the blowpipe. For this reason, I stopped wearing the glengarry for a time, but many events insist upon it, and frankly, I feel it's more respectful and the uniform looks complete when I wear it.</p>
<p>Even the British Regiments eschewed wool doublets and wool glengarries when stationed in the tropics, wearing cotton doublets and pith helmets instead.  Sensible! Kilts and jackets are now available in lighter material than was traditional... I recently thought, why not the glengarry too? And so The Airy Glengarry was conceived.  ""Old World Style... New World Comfort(TM)""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Pre-orders made production possible</h3>
<p>I had a prototype made - the one you see all over this site.  I then launched a 10-day  crowdfunding campaign, which was very successful, and thanks to those who took a chance on this product, production of The Airy Glengarry is funded!  I know you won't be disappointed when your Airy Glengarry reaches you.</p>
<p>Folks can now order an Airy Glengarry from stock - simple visit The Airy Glengarry Facebook page and the FAQ section at the top gives instructions for paying via Paypal, or sending a check.  There is also an eBay listing for single glengarries if you desire the protection of eBay as well as Paypal. If you are interested in a Band Discount, message me through The Airy Glengarry Facebook page - I'm eager to work with you. Gift Certificates are available through this very page!</p>
<p>Right now The Airy Glengarry is only available to folks in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.  Stay tuned via this page and/or ""like"" The Airy Glengarry Facebook page to receive updates regarding production, shipping dates, and promotions.  Thank you for your support.</p>

<p><span><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://greatendesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Q-Watch-4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The world is getting closer together with each technological step forward we take. Smart phones fuse cellular technology together with the Internet to bring us into a world that is never unplugged. Staying connected is now a vital part of business, play and the overall human social experience.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that it's that human element that still makes me prone to human mistakes — I'm constantly misplacing or forgetting my phone at the worst times, leaving me unplugged and at a disadvantage. Subconsciously, I suppose it's because my phone such a required element in society that I don't want to carry it sometimes.</p>
<p>But that's just not an option, so I started thinking about ways I could still stay connected without having to duct-tape the phone to my arm or strap on an unfashionable pair of Google glasses. Thinking about my problem, I looked down to check the time and the proverbial light bulb went on above my head—my watch was holding all the answers. Making a multifunction watch seemed like the right thing to do, so I sat down and invented the Q Watch (of course, it wasn't that simple—but for sake of brevity).</p>
<h1>The Q Watch has Everything You Need to Stay Connected</h1>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://greatendesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Q-Watch-3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Now while multifunction watches are nothing new—didn't we all have a calculator watch back in the day—there has never been anything so comprehensively designed as the Q Watch. This is the ultimate phone watch that will serve your every need. Further, the ultra-thin, lightweight, sleek design makes this watch aesthetically fashionable for just about any style—think Tony Stark cool.</p>
<p>The Q Watch can be your backup cellphone, your emergency contact device or your all-around, reliable main source of connectedness. It's that comprehensive. Plus, the Q Watch comes with a rechargeable battery. Bluetooth capable, a hi-def touchscreen, a video and still camera—this is the only multifunction watch that is actually deserving of that title.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://greatendesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Q-Watch-8.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>Why this Watch NEEDS to be Made</h1>
<p>Take a look at all the features I was able to pack into the working prototype of the Q Watch:</p>

<p>The Q Watch can only be made available to the public with your help. We've done all the designing and technical problem solving, working all of the bugs out. The prototype is on our wrists and if I do say, it's pretty darn cool. Now we just need to raise the money up to bring it to you!</p>
<p>We're looking to raise $10,000 for manufacturing and fulfillment. As a reward and thank you for helping us take the next logical step forward in connection technology, you'll get the early bird discount on the Q Watch. You'll be able to own the Q Watch before it's on the market. We have to warn you though, be prepared for a lot of questions like, “What the heck is that?” and “Where can I get one?”</p>
<p>On behalf of the Q Watch family, I'd just like to say thank you so much for taking the time to read and consider helping bring this project to life. It's been a passionate journey thus far and we hope that you'll help us take that final step and be a part of something amazingly cool, special and great—the Q Watch! </p></div>","Bringing Full Technological Functionality and Connectivity to Your Wrist

 
The world is getting closer together with each technological step forward we take. Smart phones fuse cellular technology together with the Internet to bring us into a world that is never unplugged. Staying connected is now a vital part of business, play and the overall human social experience.
Unfortunately, that it's that human element that still makes me prone to human mistakes — I'm constantly misplacing or forgetting my phone at the worst times, leaving me unplugged and at a disadvantage. Subconsciously, I suppose it's because my phone such a required element in society that I don't want to carry it sometimes.
But that's just not an option, so I started thinking about ways I could still stay connected without having to duct-tape the phone to my arm or strap on an unfashionable pair of Google glasses. Thinking about my problem, I looked down to check the time and the proverbial light bulb went on above my head—my watch was holding all the answers. Making a multifunction watch seemed like the right thing to do, so I sat down and invented the Q Watch (of course, it wasn't that simple—but for sake of brevity).
The Q Watch has Everything You Need to Stay Connected

Now while multifunction watches are nothing new—didn't we all have a calculator watch back in the day—there has never been anything so comprehensively designed as the Q Watch. This is the ultimate phone watch that will serve your every need. Further, the ultra-thin, lightweight, sleek design makes this watch aesthetically fashionable for just about any style—think Tony Stark cool.
The Q Watch can be your backup cellphone, your emergency contact device or your all-around, reliable main source of connectedness. It's that comprehensive. Plus, the Q Watch comes with a rechargeable battery. Bluetooth capable, a hi-def touchscreen, a video and still camera—this is the only multifunction watch that is actually deserving of that title.

Why this Watch NEEDS to be Made
Take a look at all the features I was able to pack into the working prototype of the Q Watch:

Network Support: GSM850/900/1800/1900MHz, GPRS
SIM: single SIM single standby
Watch Screen: 1.54' 260K colors high definition touch screen, 240 x 240px
Ringtone: 64 chords, support mp3, midi ringtones
Multimedia Support: 3GP, AVI, MP3, MP4, video recorder, voice recorder, FM radio
Camera: 1.3MP CMOS sensor, 640 x 480px
Support TF extension up to 8GB maximally
Support WAP, Bluetooth, MMS, SMS, GPRS etc.
Build-in calendar, To Do List, Alarm Clock, World Time, Stopwatch, E-book Reader, Calculator
Support JAVA2.0
Rechargeable battery.
Standby Time: about 100 hours

Here's a simple flowchart I made to show you how this works

This could be you..

Here are the various styles and colors available for shirts





For those of you wondering how much of your money is going towards charity, below is a current estimate of the total costs that are included in your purchase.  The total amount, minus these costs will be donated to the Rwandan Orphans Project.
Based on this estimate - over 25% of your $22 shirt purchase will be sent to the Rwandan Orphans Project.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

Turning Plastic Bottles Into Bags
Our bags are the perfect pick if you’re looking for the right blend of style and function.

1. Recycled Plastic Bottles - Our Earth bags are the world's first impactful and transparent bags: made out of 100% recycled plastic bottles. 

2. Repurposed Billboards - The Hamilton Perkins Collection Earth bags are lined with repurposed billboard vinyl. Each bag's lining is different, each bag is unique. 
3. Design, transparency, and impact - Hamilton Perkins Collection bags reduce waste levels, cut carbon emissions in the environment, and conserve water.
   


















Building a better bag
We had trouble finding a backpack that could meet our basic needs in a practical and socially responsible way. Most bags are one-dimensional and don’t give the traveler the option to choose the version of their bag that could make their life easier when traveling.
The Hamilton Perkins Collection Earth bag is an all-in-one bag that converts into a backpack or duffle bag. The Earth bag features a 3-way zippered compartment that allows easy access to laptops, books, and travel documents.

We also wanted a mascara that was safe to wear and wouldn't harm our eyes and didn't streak or clump...all without breaking the bank. We wanted a mascara that provided a confidence boost that, with each swipe, helped us conquer anything that came our way, but we never found one. So, we decided to create one! Just like a chocolate, vanilla swirl ice cream cone, the Lash Next Door consists of 2 formulas - 1 that lengthens and 1 that volumizes. It's formulated without TEA, DEA, Parabens, Sulfates, and Phthalates and is made with clean ingredients, so it's safe for your eyes! To top it off, you can apply layer on top of layer without clumps, wear it all day, and easily wash it off.

You can add videos, pictures and even record personal messages for your child, grand child, niece or nephews. When they become an adult they can watch these videos, see pictures and receive messages for years to come, over and over all at the touch of a buttonImagine receiving video messages from your Nana and Pa and re-living those memories of them anytime you like? I sure wish i could without having to dust off the old VCR, forever fast forwarding and rewinding trying to find those moments.We got this idea from our beautiful daughter Mila, because when she was born, our lives changed. We wanted her to know how much we loved her and how happy she made us from the very first moment we saw her. We wanted her to somehow share this experience with us forever... more than just photos in an album or stored somewhere on a hard drive.The idea of the 'App' came when Mila was just a few months old, she managed to grab my iPhone and with her little thumb started swiping the screen, looking through all the images as if she knew exactly what she was doing. I was so amazed.... and that's when it hit me. A virtual journal that could accessed by the touch of a button anywhere, anytime.My own family live overseas, so it was hard for them to keep track of the development of Mila... I tried to send them updates on email and other forms of media however, i feel they didn't get to share the most special moments as she was growing.With a special option on the 'App' you can nominate family members and friends to be able to view and add their own media to your baby's journal. This way they can see what you have posted, as well as post any special moments they may share with your child. I want everyone in this situation to have the freedom to share these MEMORIES and to be able to be involved in every aspect of the child's development. This is the child's journal and it's memories will be kept for them to share with their children...During the development, similar Apps were created and due to limited budget, we only managed to complete version with limited functionality. We have invested so much time and every last dollar we had to create this vision to make it into a reality. We believe that this application will be successful in giving families all over the world an opportunity to create and share memories with their children forever.Why I Need FundingMy Baby Mail™ is still in the early stages of development and with the help of an investment we will be able to create and release version two with more functionality and better design so My Baby Mail becomes an iconic application. We have always believed in this product and we hope that you as an investor believes in the idea and its longevity. To get the ball rolling we need to employ advisors and designers to assist us in developing version 2. We will need to cover their costs and operating costs for the next 12 months. Your funding will also allow us to cover development costs and ongoing server costs, these costs are in the region of $50,000 alone. We will be dedicating most of this to the developers for version 2 however we will need to ensure we have enough for future developments and improvements just shortly after the release of version 2. Our PerksDonate $1 and we will donate 50c to The Royal Children's Hospital                                              Donate $5 to help our cause, we appreciate all donations big or small                                            Donate $10 and we'll give you a shout out on our Thank you page                                      Donate $25 for an extra 25GB of storage for on your own My Baby Mail™ account                                               Donate $100 for an extra 100GB of storage for FREE on your My Baby Mail™ account                                         Donate $300 and receive a special keepsake book printed for you or family member of all the images stored on your My Baby Mail™ account                                           Donate $10,000 and receive 2% of shares in the profits and we will donate 2% of profits to a charity of your choice                The ImpactYou will make this dream come true for us and we will be able to help create many precious memories.

<p>Chick Boss is a socially responsible fashion accessory company with a fun name, cute logo and social mission. We seek out individuals from marginalized communities in Northern Guatemala to train as artisans and employ for higher than fair trade wages and benefits. Traditional metalsmithing and beading techniques are used to create high-style, high-quality fashion pieces that reflect the wearer's personality and commitment to irradicating poverty.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong><span style=""font-family: hero; font-size: medium;""><span style=""color: #00a8b4; font-size: large;"">Our Challenge </span></span></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Since our founding in 2010 we have created a well-respected brand, modern design style, and comprehensive infrastructure. Our training, quality control and production systems are scalable and ready to expand. Chick Boss products are now sold at Siman, one of the largest department stores in Central America, Casa del Jade, the premier supplier of Guatemalan jade jewelry and stones and soon at Novica, the web store of National Geographic.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In a meeting on August 1 of this year with Silvia Leech, owner of Casa del Jade, we started to explore the idea of adding jade to the Chick Boss line. She put together some prototypes (on very short notice I might add) and gave them to me to take back to the US. Well... see for yourself... THE JADE CHANGES EVERYTHING!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So.. we're off to 2 fashion trade shows from August 14-22 at which we will offer our line with and without jade. We need your help to help pay for those trips but more importantly now, to expand to offer GUATEMALAN JADE as part of our line.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">In 2001, Chick Boss founder Pat Pannell, journeyed to the Guatemalan community of San Andres for an intensive Spanish immersion program. Long story short... she fell in love with her host family, After learning that the children were not in school because they couldn't afford uniforms and books, she pledged to personally sponsor their educations up to and including university.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">After a number of return trips to San Andres, Pat witnessed a growing problem in the community where an entire generation of young people were connected to each other and the global community via the use of cell phones and social media. However, their parents were economically disadvantaged; illiterate, unskilled and desperately poor, unable to provide the kind of income that would send them to school and allow them to compete in the technologically competitive world.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It was in 2010 that Pat and her sister Jeanne started Chick Boss with the goal of making a substantial, not marginal difference for families lead by parents in this forgotton region of Guatemala. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We know that people are always going through different times in their life. Sometimes it's a great experience, it can also be a bad one. 
FlipLife Apparel wants to provide an outlet and platform for people 
to be able to express that change in their life through Christ, plain 
and simple. No hidden messages, express yourself through clothes that 
mean something to you and tell a story. We want other people to question
 and think about it, this allows us to connect with them on a personal 
and spiritual level. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>FlipLife has the potential to reach people, through other 
people just like them. We want the brand to have an impact from the 
people who wear it. Once it has left the printing press, it carries a 
meaning for whoever puts it on. It makes a statement and shows others 
that you stand for change, not just another cool t-shirt, but part of a 
whole body of believers.</p>
<p>The essence of a company is only driven by what it stands for. The 
goals we set for FlipLife are based upon what we think is 
possible by the product and the result of that product being worn by 
people. Change isn't something you can do overnight, it takes practice 
and commitment. We offer that to people, the opportunity to change by 
what you wear. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need money to make this happen, plain and simple! All of the money raised will be put towards printing and producing  our ""FlipLife Spring Collection"". We have about 5-6 designs already including new guys shirts, girls shirts, hoodies and beanies. This will allow us to be able to print the designs we have come up with and have our project grow! The money will also go to keeping our website up and being able to come out with new videos and photoshoots at the beginning of our spring collection. We would like to be able to contact different stores and travel to clothing shops to present our ideas to them, this will give us that shot to do just that. You will be a part of something that is actually happening, and we will document every part of it!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Once our goal date is over, we will get everything printed and send it out to you!<br/></p>

<p style="""">Marie’s Masks $9,000 Indiegogo goal will allow us to produce these cheerfully designed medical masks in large quantities. A hospital can be a scary place for young patients.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Last year, on a trip to Japan, I found a shoe in a corner store. I brought back a few pairs as a gift for my girlfriend and everyone that saw them wanted a pair. I started to get serious about the idea of making my own pairs in march of 2011 and I've been able to boot strap the project until now (shoe pun). Sumisu Shoes are heavily inspired by those pairs I brought back, but there have been some significant changes. The kind of changes that people that read ""Born to Run"" will like plus some serious comfort innovation.</span></h3>
<div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Now we just need your help to make it happen. Check out all the awesome reasons to give on the right, keep reading for the best reason to give. You'll get all these awesome perks when the shoes launch!</span></div>
<p><br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Mission</h3>
<p>100% of the profits from Sumisu Shoe Co. will be donated to the East Japan Earthquake relief fund. Your money will mean that these shoes will be produced without a high interest loan from the bank, so more money will be in the hands of the people that need it most. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where's all that cash going?</h3>
<p>The $15,000 goal is half the story, and truthfully half the goal. If we can double that then we won't have to talk to a bank all all to make the first limited edition run happen. If we can't, this money will show the bank that we have serious interest and then we can raise more funds by traditional means.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Contributing will buy us the plane tickets we need to visit the factory and finalize the sample and will produce a 3,000 pair limited edition run of the shoes. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>These limited edition shoes will, in part, be going to the amazing people that chose to contribute on IndieGoGo. I will also send a pair to Gwen Stefani and a pair to the president.    </p>

</div></div>","The Story
Last year, on a trip to Japan, I found a shoe in a corner store. I brought back a few pairs as a gift for my girlfriend and everyone that saw them wanted a pair. I started to get serious about the idea of making my own pairs in march of 2011 and I've been able to boot strap the project until now (shoe pun). Sumisu Shoes are heavily inspired by those pairs I brought back, but there have been some significant changes. The kind of changes that people that read ""Born to Run"" will like plus some serious comfort innovation.

Now we just need your help to make it happen. Check out all the awesome reasons to give on the right, keep reading for the best reason to give. You'll get all these awesome perks when the shoes launch!




The Mission
100% of the profits from Sumisu Shoe Co. will be donated to the East Japan Earthquake relief fund. Your money will mean that these shoes will be produced without a high interest loan from the bank, so more money will be in the hands of the people that need it most. 


Where's all that cash going?
The $15,000 goal is half the story, and truthfully half the goal. If we can double that then we won't have to talk to a bank all all to make the first limited edition run happen. If we can't, this money will show the bank that we have serious interest and then we can raise more funds by traditional means.

Contributing will buy us the plane tickets we need to visit the factory and finalize the sample and will produce a 3,000 pair limited edition run of the shoes. 

These limited edition shoes will, in part, be going to the amazing people that chose to contribute on IndieGoGo. I will also send a pair to Gwen Stefani and a pair to the president.    



I'm broke, but I want to make your dreams happen.

If you can't spare a dollar, I understand. I was a college student once too. I've maxed out my credit cards making this happen so everything you do helps. Tell your friends about this project. Use the share tools on the page to get the word out. Print out this page and tack it up at your local coffee shop, tell your mom all you want for your birthday is a pair of Sumisu Shoes. 





100% of profits go to East Japan Earthquake Fund
100% of feet feel awesome in Sumisu Shoes
Contribute!

Tell your friends and make them share!





Thank you!

We have chosen to produce predominantly bamboo t-shirts because of their ethical, sustainable and health benefits. The addition of the 30% organic cotton helps to give structure and shape to the t-shirts. </p><p></p><p><b>Bamboo is one of the softest, most breathable, non-allergic, and environmentally responsible fabrics in the world today.</b></p><p></p><p><b>Benefits to you</b></p><p></p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<b>Naturally soft</b> - Bamboo clothing is softer than the softest cotton. It has a natural sheen and drapes like silk or satin, yet is cheaper and more durable. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Allergy reduced</b> - Bamboo is ideal for people with sensitive skin, allergies or dermatitis. This is due to it's organic and naturally smooth fibre properties. </li>
<li>
<b>Thermal regulating</b> - Bamboo ensures that you are warm in the winter and cool in the summer. </li>
<li>
<b>Absorbs moisture</b> - Bamboo fibre is four times more absorbent than cotton. Under a microscope the fibre reveals various micro-holes, which allow the fabric to have superior absorption and evaporate human sweat rapidly. </li>
<li>
<b>Breathable</b> - Bamboo has exceptional breathability because of the porous qualities of its fibres; clothing made of bamboo resists clinging during hot weather or exercise. </li>
<li>
<b>Anti-bacterial</b> - Bamboo fabric contains a naturally occurring anti-microbial agent called kun. This prevents bacteria from cultivating on it, which means it helps keep you odour free. </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><p><b>Benefits to the planet</b></p><p></p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<b>Cleans the air</b> - Bamboo gives us clean air to breathe, consumes carbon dioxide and, because bamboo forests are so dense, returns 30% more oxygen to the atmosphere than trees. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Requires less energy &amp; water to grow</b> - It takes much less energy to grow and sustain bamboo than cotton. Bamboo plantations require very little maintenance. Bamboo also requires very little water and can survive harsh weather conditions such as drought, flooding and high temperatures.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Reclaims land</b> - Because of its rapid growth and root structure, bamboo can, in a very short time, reclaim land destroyed by overgrazing and over-building and clean the soil of toxins. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Decreases soil erosion</b> - Yearly replanting of crops such as cotton leads to soil erosion. The extensive root system of bamboo and the fact that it is not uprooted during harvesting means bamboo actually helps preserve soil and prevent soil erosion. </li>
<li>
<b>Slows deforestation</b> - Bamboo planting can slow deforestation, providing an alternative source of cellulose fibre for the textile industry. It allows communities to turn away from the destruction of their native forests and to construct commercial bamboo plantations that can be selectively harvested annually without the destruction of the grove. </li>
<li>
<b>Can be grown without pesticides</b> - Bamboo can be grown without pesticides or chemicals because of it's own anti-bacterial agent. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Can be harvested sustainably</b> - Bamboo is one of the fastest growing plants on the planet, making it a high yield renewable resource. It can be selectively harvested annually and is capable of complete regeneration without the need to replant. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>100% biodegradable</b> - Bamboo fibre is a natural product derived entirely from plant cellulose and is biodegradable in soil by micro organisms and sunlight.<span style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 0px;""> </span>Having reached its useful life, clothing made from bamboo can be composted and disposed of in an organic and environmentally friendly manner. Synthetic fibres such as nylon and polyester are not biodegradable and remain in landfill for longer.</li>

So I found the Katja House Foundation through a company called B1G1 who help you to give for every product someone buys from you (Buy1Give1). So, for every t-shirt that you buy, we will clothe an orphaned child at Katja House in Kathmandu and for every tote you buy, we will provide shelter for one child at the orphanage for one night. 4 designs lovingly hand painted by KatChoose from any of the four designs below and have it printed on your choice of a mens or womens bamboo t-shirt or a 100% organic cotton tote bag.

Allergy reduced - Bamboo is ideal for people with sensitive skin, allergies or dermatitis. This is due to it's organic and naturally smooth fibre properties. 

Thermal regulating - Bamboo ensures that you are warm in the winter and cool in the summer. 

Absorbs moisture - Bamboo fibre is four times more absorbent than cotton. Under a microscope the fibre reveals various micro-holes, which allow the fabric to have superior absorption and evaporate human sweat rapidly. 

Breathable - Bamboo has exceptional breathability because of the porous qualities of its fibres; clothing made of bamboo resists clinging during hot weather or exercise. 

Anti-bacterial - Bamboo fabric contains a naturally occurring anti-microbial agent called kun. This prevents bacteria from cultivating on it, which means it helps keep you odour free. 
Benefits to the planet

Cleans the air - Bamboo gives us clean air to breathe, consumes carbon dioxide and, because bamboo forests are so dense, returns 30% more oxygen to the atmosphere than trees. 


Requires less energy & water to grow - It takes much less energy to grow and sustain bamboo than cotton. Bamboo plantations require very little maintenance. Bamboo also requires very little water and can survive harsh weather conditions such as drought, flooding and high temperatures.


Reclaims land - Because of its rapid growth and root structure, bamboo can, in a very short time, reclaim land destroyed by overgrazing and over-building and clean the soil of toxins. 


Decreases soil erosion - Yearly replanting of crops such as cotton leads to soil erosion. The extensive root system of bamboo and the fact that it is not uprooted during harvesting means bamboo actually helps preserve soil and prevent soil erosion. 

Slows deforestation - Bamboo planting can slow deforestation, providing an alternative source of cellulose fibre for the textile industry. It allows communities to turn away from the destruction of their native forests and to construct commercial bamboo plantations that can be selectively harvested annually without the destruction of the grove. 

Can be grown without pesticides - Bamboo can be grown without pesticides or chemicals because of it's own anti-bacterial agent. 


Can be harvested sustainably - Bamboo is one of the fastest growing plants on the planet, making it a high yield renewable resource. It can be selectively harvested annually and is capable of complete regeneration without the need to replant. 


100% biodegradable - Bamboo fibre is a natural product derived entirely from plant cellulose and is biodegradable in soil by micro organisms and sunlight. Having reached its useful life, clothing made from bamboo can be composted and disposed of in an organic and environmentally friendly manner. Synthetic fibres such as nylon and polyester are not biodegradable and remain in landfill for longer.
Benefits to peopleOur bamboo t-shirts are endorsed by the Fairwear Foundation (FWF) who represent Ethical Trade & Justice for Workers. They exist to promote fair labour conditions in the garment industry worldwide.100% organic cotton tote bagsOur tote bags are made from certified organic cotton. Which means from field to factory to you, there are no nasties involved.The Styles & SizesWe are keeping things simple to start with and only offering our prints on to white t-shirt and natural coloured tote bags.

About MeI have over 11 years experience working for some of the biggest brands on the planet, like Virgin, Sky and The Times.

<h3>What is this ""Roller Derby"" Stuff?</h3>
<p>Roller derby is taking the nation by storm. Every day, more and more women and girls are finding their place in the world - in the rink! While we aren't the roller derby of the 70's with all the throat punching and clotheslining, we are still a group of empowered, strong, in-your-face women. We'll knock each other down, give her the bruise of a lifetime and then buy her a beer afterwards. We'll dress derby (booty shorts, fishnets and knee high socks!), go to practice, then do our grocery shopping afterwards - because derby makes us confident enough to do so. </p>
<p>So, it's about time to be able to show everyone you're a derby girl without sporting the booty shorts (hey, it gets cold sometimes!). Or maybe you're a fan of derby and want to show your support. You're a ref and don't want to wear your zebra stripes all the time? No prob!</p>
<p>Get Whipped Clothing will be launching a brand that caters to everyone in the derby world. We will have t-shirts and booty shorts to get started. We will eventually be your one-stop-shop for derby apparel - from our cornerstone t-shirts to funky socks and frilly tutus. </p>
<h3>Who Are You, Anyway?</h3>
<p>My name is Kat Tastrophy and I have just recently been drafted to my first team. I got really interested in roller derby a couple of years ago and have been following it since. After I moved to a smaller town and found out they had a league - I joined up as soon as I found out who to talk to. I started learning the ropes this past June, and just went through freshmeat (derby vocab for ""newbie"") training and testing. Derby is quite the life-changer - let me be honest. It's a confidence booster to the extreme, it's a supportive environment, and everyone always fits in. Once I strap those skates on - I'm a different person, and I like her alot. :)</p>
<p>When I'm not on my wheels, I'm a website, graphics and t-shirt designer by trade. I've been doing that for about 10 years now. I'm also a mom, a soon-to-be-wife and an online student. </p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>You Want Details!</p>
<ul>
<li>First run of shirts and transfers. </li>
<li>Packaging and labeling supplies. </li>

<h3>The Line</h3>
<p>We plan to print on high-quality, super-soft, pre-shrunk fitted tees. This type of tee was chosen because it a) feels great to wear, b) a fitted tee makes a girl feel sexy in a t-shirt (which is hard to do, sometimes) and c) it's what my league requested I use :)</p>
<p>Our booty shorts will be high-quality boy cut shorts made from comfort conscious ringspun cotton and spandex.</p>
<p>Example phrases you may see on a Get Whipped item: </p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not a superhero, but I do wear tights. </li>
<li>Blockers don't wear panties.</li>

<p>There is a fundamental problem with buying shoes online, which is finding the proper size that fits. Online footwear retailers experience on average 1 of every 4 pairs of shoes returned (25%) primarily due to improper fit. vFit technology can help solve that issue.</p>
<p>Online footwear sales in the U.S. grew to over $8 Billion in 2012 and growing at a rate of 17% annually. That translates to $2 Billion in shoes being returned. That’s a staggering number when you look at it this way! </p>
<p>Personally, I love the convenience of buying shoes online, but I feel guilty buying three of the same shoes in three different sizes at the same time, knowing that I will keep one pair and return the two that don’t fit. Even when the retailer will pay for free returns, I know somebody ultimately pays.</p>
<p>There must be a better way...</p>
<p>vFit Shoes App was developed to help customers make better-educated decisions when deciding what shoe and size to buy and from what retailer to can get the shoes from.</p>
<p>Even with the enormous growth of Web search and comparison-shopping sites, consumers still lack an easy way to shop for the proper fitting shoes and to be confident in the size they need. That is, <strong>until now.</strong> </p>
<p>vFit is the only shoe fitting technology that allows shoe buyers the ability to compare the exact shape of their feet to the inside shape of shoes to visualize and determine the best size and fit. To demonstrate this process we are developing a vertical search engine for shoe shopping that puts every product, every store, every sale, coupon and discount, right at your fingertips. </p>
<p>Ten years ago we started a company that invented a kiosk/scanner <a href=""http://youtu.be/1SZ0uP9rZxw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FormaLogix YouTube</a> which allowed people to capture a 3D image of their feet and virtually try shoes on. The kiosks were too costly for most retailers to buy but in reality, those retailers were afraid customers would use the scans to buy shoes from other online only retailers.</p>
<p>We were forced to rent space in several malls in California to place the kiosk/scanners and had positive feedback from customers, but that business model was far too expensive, we couldn't attract venture capital so we realized we needed a more cost effective way to get people scanned. Over 60,000 people used the kiosk/scanners and we received valuable data on the actual size and shape of all those feet. But what was truly amazing was when customers used their scans to buy shoes online, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">only 3%</span> of those shoes were ever returned!</p>

Y, de repente, ¡la idea surgió! - ""¡Podríamos aprovecharnos de las nuevas tecnologías para crear una plataforma desde la que podamos ofrecer distinción y personalización a un precio accesible para todos!"".</p>
<p>Blackpier nació de la idea de revolucionar el mercado de la moda y de hacer llegar al máximo número de personas una manera de vestir que parecía haber quedado en el olvido: la sastrería a medida.</p>
<div style=""font-size: 28px; color: #333; margin-bottom: 20px;""><b>¿Por qué a medida?</b></div>
<p>Hoy en día, la producción en masa se está imponiendo en el mercado de la moda. Pero la moda es mucho más que piezas de ropa confeccionadas en grandes industrias con tallas estándares. Es necesario recordar que <b>la moda es un arte, un fenómeno social y cultural que nos define día a día</b>.<br/></p>
<p>En Blackpier estamos convencidos de que el centro de atención debe recaer en ti. Por eso, confeccionamos prendas que se adaptan perfectamente a tu cuerpo y, por esa razón, te hacen sentir mejor. <b>Más tiempo para ti, más ahorro, y un ilimitado nivel de personalización </b>son sólo algunas de las ventajas de las que podrás beneficiarte si tienes a Blackpier en mente en el momento de renovar o ampliar tu vestuario.</p>

<div style=""font-size: 28px; color: #333; margin-bottom: 20px;""><b>¿Por qué acudimos a Indiegogo?</b></div>
<p>Actualmente, Blackpier tiene 2 años y medio de vida y, durante este tiempo, hemos conseguido hacer que la gente se haga con su ropa de una manera diferente a la que estaban acostumbrados.</p>
<p>Con el paso del tiempo, nos hemos dado cuenta de que, a la idea inicial de Blackpier, se le ha sumado el importante factor de saber que hemos creado una respuesta a la demanda de un público con dificultades para vestir. Nos enorgullece saber que estas personas con problemas para comprar en tiendas convencionales han encontrado en nosotros no sólo una solución, sino una nueva manera de disfrutar de la ropa que ellos quieren tener. Pero no sólo eso; también vemos que, personas que no tienen tiempo para ir de una tienda a otra buscando lo que realmente necesitan, nos hacen llegar su contento con Blackpier.</p>
<p>Después de descubrir el mundo del crowdfunding, hemos visto en él una gran oportunidad para pedir la ayuda que necesitamos para <b>hacer llegar nuestro proyecto al máximo número de personas posible</b>.</p>

<li>A crear nuevas colecciones con nuevos estilos acordes a las tendencias en la moda, lo que implica tener la ventaja de ofrecer moda actual en la ropa a medida.</li>
<li>A satisfacer la demanda de la mujer. Después de haber recibido muchas peticiones de mujeres con problemas para vestir trajes y camisas para trabajar, queremos poder abastecer también al público femenino con prendas a medida.</li>

<p>A la mayoría de los hombres no les gusta ir de compras y pueden enfrentarse a una experiencia frustrante e intimidatoria. Blackpier elimina el estrés de realizar las compras y permite que los hombres puedan hacerse con un traje a medida desde la comodidad de su casa u oficina. En cuanto el cliente ya ha creado su perfil de medidas (sólo se necesitan unos 10 o 15 minutos), <b>pedir un traje a medida cuesta menos de 1 minuto</b>.</p>
<p>Cada traje Blackpier está confecionado para un único individuo. Y, con la mayoría de trajes a un precio de 199,95€, Blackpier hace que la sastrería a medida sea accesible a un gran público.

<p>Si lo que deseas es sentirte bien con tu vestuario, disfrutar de las mejores telas y de una confección artesanal, puntada a puntada, ésta es tu mejor elección. <br/>Es probable que, como otras muchas personas, no encuentres fácilmente lo que estás buscando, ya que tu estilo y medidas quedan fuera de los estándares de la ropa producida en la confección industrial. Gracias a nuestros sastres, nunca más volverás a sufrir las incomodidades de una chaqueta demasiado ajustada; o una camisa que se ajusta bien alrededor del cuello, pero es demasiado holgada o ajustada alrededor del resto del cuerpo; o los pantalones que al sentarse le quedan demasiado largos.</p>

Por eso, confeccionamos prendas que se adaptan perfectamente a tu cuerpo y, por esa razón, te hacen sentir mejor. Más tiempo para ti, más ahorro, y un ilimitado nivel de personalización son sólo algunas de las ventajas de las que podrás beneficiarte si tienes a Blackpier en mente en el momento de renovar o ampliar tu vestuario.


¿Por qué acudimos a Indiegogo?
Actualmente, Blackpier tiene 2 años y medio de vida y, durante este tiempo, hemos conseguido hacer que la gente se haga con su ropa de una manera diferente a la que estaban acostumbrados.
Con el paso del tiempo, nos hemos dado cuenta de que, a la idea inicial de Blackpier, se le ha sumado el importante factor de saber que hemos creado una respuesta a la demanda de un público con dificultades para vestir. Nos enorgullece saber que estas personas con problemas para comprar en tiendas convencionales han encontrado en nosotros no sólo una solución, sino una nueva manera de disfrutar de la ropa que ellos quieren tener. Pero no sólo eso; también vemos que, personas que no tienen tiempo para ir de una tienda a otra buscando lo que realmente necesitan, nos hacen llegar su contento con Blackpier.
Después de descubrir el mundo del crowdfunding, hemos visto en él una gran oportunidad para pedir la ayuda que necesitamos para hacer llegar nuestro proyecto al máximo número de personas posible.
¿Dónde irán a parar los fondos de la campaña?

A expandir nuestros productos y servicios a esos hombres que tienen problemas para vestir con tallas estándar y a aquellos que no encuentran ropa que les satisfaga en las tiendas convencionales.
A crear nuevas colecciones con nuevos estilos acordes a las tendencias en la moda, lo que implica tener la ventaja de ofrecer moda actual en la ropa a medida.
A satisfacer la demanda de la mujer. Después de haber recibido muchas peticiones de mujeres con problemas para vestir trajes y camisas para trabajar, queremos poder abastecer también al público femenino con prendas a medida.
A revolucionar el sector clásico de la moda, fusionando moda y tecnología.

ACERCA DE BLACKPIER
Con un sistema online único e innovador, Blackpier ha revolucionado la manera en que los hombres compran trajes y ha conseguido hacer que el adquirir trajes a medida sea tan fácil como descargarse una aplicación desde la AppStore.
A la mayoría de los hombres no les gusta ir de compras y pueden enfrentarse a una experiencia frustrante e intimidatoria. Blackpier elimina el estrés de realizar las compras y permite que los hombres puedan hacerse con un traje a medida desde la comodidad de su casa u oficina. En cuanto el cliente ya ha creado su perfil de medidas (sólo se necesitan unos 10 o 15 minutos), pedir un traje a medida cuesta menos de 1 minuto.
Cada traje Blackpier está confecionado para un único individuo. Y, con la mayoría de trajes a un precio de 199,95€, Blackpier hace que la sastrería a medida sea accesible a un gran público. Los trajes están disponibles online en www.blackpier.com/es 
.
Mimamos tu prenda en cada detalle
Encontrar tu estilo a medida ya es posible gracias a la sastrería y camisería tradicional de Blackpier. Con nuestros profesionales de la medida, la elección es tuya
Si lo que deseas es sentirte bien con tu vestuario, disfrutar de las mejores telas y de una confección artesanal, puntada a puntada, ésta es tu mejor elección. Es probable que, como otras muchas personas, no encuentres fácilmente lo que estás buscando, ya que tu estilo y medidas quedan fuera de los estándares de la ropa producida en la confección industrial. Gracias a nuestros sastres, nunca más volverás a sufrir las incomodidades de una chaqueta demasiado ajustada; o una camisa que se ajusta bien alrededor del cuello, pero es demasiado holgada o ajustada alrededor del resto del cuerpo; o los pantalones que al sentarse le quedan demasiado largos.


Con la sastrería a medida, te sentirás mejor 
Podrás escoger tu propio estilo y personalizarlo de una forma rápida y sencilla. Ofrecemos una variedad de tejidos y estilos, en función de las últimas tendencias de la moda y con nuevos diseños y tejidos. Nuestra colección permite elegir la textura, dibujo y color, consiguiendo así el estilo personalizado y único que usted desea para su traje o camisa. 
La atención al detalle y la artesanía meticulosa

Nuestras prendas están confeccionadas de forma artesanal por nuestros sastres, utilizando sólo métodos tradicionales. Nuestra obsesión está en cuidar al máximo cada detalle para darle una satisfacción máxima. Desde la meticulosidad de los ojales abiertos y cosidos a mano, hasta el particular bordado del bolsillo interior. Cada prenda elaborada por Blackpier es fruto del escrupuloso trabajo artesanal y minucioso por parte de nuestros sastres, con más de 20 años de experiencia, pensando únicamente en su satisfacción en el momento en que usted se la sienta como un guante.El cuidado más riguroso llega hasta la puerta de tu casa  
Porque una vez terminada, tu prenda es presentada y protegida en un embalaje especial de diseño exclusivo, que protegerá el producto en el largo trayecto hasta tu casa.Te damos la bienvenida al mundo Blackpier. Prepárate para vivir la experiencia única de disfrutar de tu propio estilo de vestir a medida.

<p>Bro’s are everywhere; if you are not a bro yourself chances are you at least know one. Bro’s aren’t just obnoxious party alpha males often seen aggressively high fiving each other with a red solo cup in one hand; they are also people, and people grow up. Bro’s grow up. Bro’s graduate. They get jobs, they run empires, they get married, and they even become bro dads. While the bro tank and aviators may spend more time in the closet for the average mature bro we’d like to think a little bit of the bro never dies.</p>
<p>A true bro knows the secret in life is to work hard and play hard but it is a known scientific fact that the warm glow of fluoresce office lights adversely affect a bro’s ability to fist pump and fight evil. For emergency situations when bro-glow reaches a dangerously low level we’ve created the Office Bro Kit. The Office Bro Kit includes everything the mature bro needs to stay focused on the job and avoid ultimate bro-limination.</p>

Dash requires less effort from you than any other wallet.
 

 
Swipe your favorite card, without ever having to take it out.
 
Dash has 2 compartments for cards; a quickdraw slot, and a second compartment for carrying the rest of your cards and IDs.

<h1>Materials</h1>
<p>To make sure that the Modern Day Briefcase is durable and will last throughout your career, we started with the best materials.  </p>
<p>We are sourcing our leather from La Bretagna in Italy, one of the premier tanneries in the world.  This leather is durable, and will also age and become more beautiful over the course of your career.  </p>
<p>For the exterior of the bag, we chose a 10 oz. waxed cotton to make the bag water resistant and durable.  In addition, we used the most reliable zippers on the market, YKK zippers, to ensure that the bag will last.</p>

<h1>Design</h1>
<p>Creating a bag that was professional and functional was not easy.  I spent countless hours coming up with the concepts that brought the Modern Day Briefcase to life.  After numerous iterations, I was able to come up with the design that perfectly combines the look and feel of a high-end satchel, with the functionality of a backpack. </p>

<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Joseph May.  I am a recovering attorney who has worked for enough people to last a lifetime.  After realizing how much I disliked attorney life, I worked for a startup as the director of operations for awhile, before I decided to risk it all, and become an entrepreneur full-time. </p>
<p>This bag project was jump-started by Mark Cuban.  Really, no joke! When I was considering whether or not to make this bag, I came across the following quote by Mark Cuban: </p>
<p>[E]very entrepreneur's job is to invent the future.  I also call it ‘kicking your own [butt].”  Someone is out there who thinks they have a better idea than you have.  A better solution than you have.  A better or more efficient product than you have...it's part of your job as the owner of the company to stay ahead of them.  <a href=""http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/222501"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/222501</a>.</p>
<p>After reading this quote, I decided I was not going to be the guy who stood on the sidelines saying, “I came up with that idea first, but I was too busy.”  From that day on, I started waking up at 4 am, so that I could work on the project for three hours before I went to work.  Now a year later, I am finally launching this bag.  </p>
<p>I have a bunch of kids (4) and a beautiful wife who keeps me on my toes.  If I'm not in the office, I'm probably road biking.  </p>

We are sourcing our leather from La Bretagna in Italy, one of the premier tanneries in the world.  This leather is durable, and will also age and become more beautiful over the course of your career.  
For the exterior of the bag, we chose a 10 oz. waxed cotton to make the bag water resistant and durable.  In addition, we used the most reliable zippers on the market, YKK zippers, to ensure that the bag will last.



Best Leather in the World from Italy




Durable Leather that will Age Beautifully




Supple, Strong Leather Accents




Leather Straps for Design and Durability, Extra Padding for Comfort



This Traditional Tannery is Where the Leather Will be Made




Water Resistant



Travel Comfortably Throughout the Year






Design
Creating a bag that was professional and functional was not easy.  I spent countless hours coming up with the concepts that brought the Modern Day Briefcase to life.  After numerous iterations, I was able to come up with the design that perfectly combines the look and feel of a high-end satchel, with the functionality of a backpack. 










Product Specifications
The bag comes in two different sizes: regular and small.  The regular bag will fit up to a 17'' inch laptop.  The small bag will fit up to a 15'' inch laptop.








Regular Size Bag - Model is 6'0""




Small Size Bag - Model is 5'2""






Production





I elected to make this bag with manufacturers that I know and trust to ensure that these bags are made of the highest quality. Production for this bag will occur as fast as possible; however, I will not cut any corners, and I will hold the manufacturers to the highest quality standards.  





About Me
Hello! My name is Joseph May.  I am a recovering attorney who has worked for enough people to last a lifetime.  After realizing how much I disliked attorney life, I worked for a startup as the director of operations for awhile, before I decided to risk it all, and become an entrepreneur full-time. 
This bag project was jump-started by Mark Cuban.  Really, no joke! When I was considering whether or not to make this bag, I came across the following quote by Mark Cuban: 
[E]very entrepreneur's job is to invent the future.  I also call it ‘kicking your own [butt].”  Someone is out there who thinks they have a better idea than you have.  A better solution than you have.  A better or more efficient product than you have...it's part of your job as the owner of the company to stay ahead of them.  http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/222501.
After reading this quote, I decided I was not going to be the guy who stood on the sidelines saying, “I came up with that idea first, but I was too busy.”  From that day on, I started waking up at 4 am, so that I could work on the project for three hours before I went to work.  Now a year later, I am finally launching this bag.  
I have a bunch of kids (4) and a beautiful wife who keeps me on my toes.  If I'm not in the office, I'm probably road biking.  





Thank you
Thank you to all of my friends, family, and backers who have supported and encouraged me throughout this whole process. I could not have done this without you!  I would especially like to thank my wife who has supported and encouraged me along the way.  Also, I would like to thank the following people who have helped me throughout my campaign:

<h3>The Indiegogo Ocean Discovery Collection</h3>
<p>We are launching <strong>world's first SmoothShell underwear collection exclusively here at Indiegogo. </strong>Our backers have the unique opportunity to be the first ones to wear the future fashion and have <strong>the most comfortable premium underwear </strong>made of regenerated ocean plastics.</p>

<p>We had an open voting for our current customers and pre-backer list about different colours and combinations for perks on our Facebook page. As a result we have pre-selected color sets for <strong>Traveller Tru</strong><strong>nk </strong>and<strong> Globetrotter Boxer</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Traveller Trunk: </strong>Trunks are quickly becoming the favourite cut for underwear among men in the know. Why? Trunk cut is a hybrid of brief and boxer brief without the heap of fabric.  Simply put they are boxer briefs with short legs and a square appearance. If you usually like briefs but want to try something a little different, consider trunks. Our trunks come with the fly and they’re great for everyday, dressing up, going out and moderate sports. You can wear trunks with just about anything. Our size chart and measurement instructions can be found at the end of this page.</p>

<p><strong>Globetrotter Boxer Brief</strong>: Most comfortable boxer briefs will cover about half of your thigh. They offer protection from chafing during workouts and sports.  With a moderate rise on the waist, our boxer briefs come without the fly and provide the same support as standard briefs - but with a complete coverage. Great for everyday wear or all sports. Excellent for use at a gym, on bike or motorcycle, paddling and other activities. Our size chart and measurement instructions can be found at the end of this page.</p>

<p>Every delivered Perk is a small win for our planet's future. In return we want You to feel comfortable with clear conscience, love Your underwear and be our customer and friend for life.</p>
<p><strong>Where does the price (MSRP $37,90) come from?</strong></p>
<p>Recycled materials  cost more than the traditional ones, but when its use becomes more common, eventually the price of the raw material comes down. Another thing is that, even if our underwear is not meant to be worn from father to son, we want to make premium quality that lasts longer.</p>

<p>Q: <strong>Where does the brand name come from?</strong></p>
<p>A: You can see the story behind The Other Danish Guy™ from the video below. For some of you this might be heavy stuff and some can even find the content inappropriate. If so; sorry. But this is how it really happened. We're just telling the truth. </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/x4LaNHs0X9o?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Q: <strong>What kind of plastic is used to generate the yarn or fabric?</strong></p>
<p>A: Below is a list of sources for plastic we use to turn into fabrics and products.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fishing nets (spent fish farming nets and ghost fishing nets)</li>
<li>Fluff (the upper part of old, spent Nylon carpets)</li>

<p>Q: <strong>How does this work in detail?</strong></p>
<p>A: Our fabrics are produced using Econyl yarn. You can read more about the process in detail from <a href=""http://www.econyl.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Econyl website</a>.</p>

<h3>How to find your fit?</h3>
<p>Our measurements are a bit smaller (meaning that our trunks and boxer briefs are larger) when compared to peers like the respected Calvin Klein or Hanes or Björn Borg. Compared to the cotton-elastane boxer briefs or trunks our fit is true size. If you consider whether, for example, it is M or L that will fit you, we suggest that you pick the smaller size. Men, often in general, buy too large underwear. Our fabric stretches two-way so <strong>you could actually find the smaller size to feel and fit you better</strong>!</p>
<p>Below is our size chart. <strong>Please note that the inch size is not the inch size of your jeans</strong>! For the best possible fit you can use measure tape to be sure about the right fit. Or, then again: just choose the smaller if you are not sure which one is better.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>The Other Danish Guy™ is a fully-operational brand. Although this is a special funding project, it’s not outside the realm of what we do every day. As we’re a brand and not factory owners, there’s always the risk of a factory closure or an inability to produce at our primary facility due to capacity issues. In the unlikely event of such an occurrence, The Other Danish Guy™ will move production to another facility that we’ve already vetted. Should we face issues with our material suppliers, we also have alternative suppliers should the need arise.</p>

<h2>Are You Still Ignoring Your Nail Health?</h2>
<p>Studies have shown that human nails grow 1mm per week, and 1g nail dirt contains 4 billion bacteria. Our hands might be the dirtiest part of body, they touch so many things everyday. Not to mention our nails which are much easier to accumulate dirt and spread infections. And Everyone is aware that nails accumulate dirt and have more chance of spreading infections. We go to gym or eat healthy food to keep body healthy, how about our nails? They are also essential parts that can guard your finger tips from scratch and injures. Healthy nails cannot be ignored anymore..</p>
<p>Cutting or trimming nails looks like the simplest thing in our life. However, the simplest thing  is always neglected. And subsequently we let them grow and get infected. Or, we cut them too much and get hurt. So, trimming them in a right way becomes a very important thing.</p>
<h2>Why Not Other Nail Clipper?</h2>
<p>Do you have the same worries? Trimming nails precisely with scissors can be a hard time, especially for infants and elders.  As what we said above, it should be a simple work. </p>

<p>Does an ordinary electric nail clipper save your nail? No, bad electric nail clipper can only hurt your nail day by day. Low power can not only make this process longer, but also hurt your nails. Loud noise is also a big problem. You don't want to attract others attention when you are clipping nails, do you?</p>

<p>Warning tech content! :)</p>
<p>The tago arc integrates existing technologies into a stylish advanced jewelry. E Ink and Near Field Communication (NFC) are both eco-friendly progressive technologies, E Ink displays only needs a little energy to change physical structure, and once changed it could stay that way practically for several years.</p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""620"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fsketchfab.com%2Fmodels%2F5c4f8a48b16a47e9abfe751a93590529%2Fembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsketchfab.com%2Fmodels%2F5c4f8a48b16a47e9abfe751a93590529&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fd35krx4ujqgbcr.cloudfront.net%2Furls%2F5c4f8a48b16a47e9abfe751a93590529%2Fthumbnails%2F56807ed13d2c4311b2552e037994f6bb%2F448.jpeg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=sketchfab"" width=""100%""></iframe></div>
Due to E Ink’s capabilities the displayed image will be 16 color greyscale on the bracelet with a smooth pixel density (150 ppi), similar. This means that the display does not have a backlight as eReaders do, the display is not 100% black and white colors. In order to change the displayed picture on the tago arc and transmit enough energy for the device to work, the user has to place his/her smartphone to precisely match both NFC chips, but this will be aided by a positioning system in your app, the image transfer is very straightforward and secure. The tago arc uses NFC instead of Bluetooth, because NFC is easier to use, smoother and consumes less energy overall. NFC induces enough energy during image transfer that the small E Ink display is able to reconstruct the chosen image.<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1192834/files/20150203054116-tago_page_design-2.jpg?1422970876"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The image transfer interval is currently 15 seconds, depending on the smartphone device and the image complexity when holding the phone precisely to the NFC chip. We’re working on time efficiency to minimize this time interval. Please note that the actual transfer time may increase when NFC chips are not aligned properly.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">For
 those of you with an iPhone out there, tago application is currently 
android only. The iPhone 6 already has the NFC technology in it, it is 
however only enabled by Apple for Apple Pay at the moment. We believe 
that the iPhone community will be able to enjoy the #tago arc feeling in

<p>As a junior developer I find it challenging to create the most powerful E Ink bracelet ever.  I believe that NFC is the next gen utility to make everyone's life easier.

<br/><p><b>*FAQ*</b></p>
<p><b>How is it powered if it doesn't need charging?</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>NFC tags are regarded as passive devices - they operate without a power supply. The same applies for the E Ink technology it does not additional power input to hold the design displayed on it. The NFC tags are reliant on an active device to come into close range before they activate. These active devices are for example your smartphones. <b> </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></b><b></b></p>
<p>In order to power these NFC tags, electromagnetic induction is used to create a current in the passive device. We won’t get into too much technical detail-basic principle is that coils of wire can be used to produce electromagnetic waves, which can then be picked up and turned back into current by a another coil of wire. This is very similar to the techniques used for other wireless charging technologies. This EM induction is generated by your smartphone at being held at close range to the #tago arc's NFC tag - which is currently placed on the inside of the bracelet. <b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></b></p>
<p><b>I have an android tablet - does the #tago arc work with a tablet too?</b></p>
<p>If your tablet is an Android tablet and has the NFC in it, than you can use your tablet as well.</p>
<p><b>How does the '$99 now the rest later' perk?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 1: pay for half of the #tago arc a $99 now</p>
<p>Step 2: return within the next 30 days click on this perk again and pay a $160</p>
<p>Disclaimer: We consider the first half of your payment a down payment for the bracelet, which is not refundable. If you return to our Indiegogo site within 30 days to pay the other half we will be shipping you a #tago arc at the end of 2015. At the finish of our campaign our Indiegogo site will remain live, so that you can pay the second half of your contribution.</p>
<p>Help: If for any reason you cannot pay your remaining $160 balance, we will send you, as thanks for your earlier $99 contribution, a 40% off voucher that you can use at a later time to purchase a #tago arc in our web-shop.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Can I get it in colour?</b><br/></p>
<p>E Ink can only display greyscale images with the current displays. In fact, there are some coloured E Ink displays on the market today, it’s just not only they’re ridiculously expensive, but also their colours are kind of pale and we decided not to use them until there will be premium quality available of this technology as well. </p>
<p><b>How does E Ink work exactly?</b></p>
<p>If you’re interested to know more about how E Ink works check out this website:<a href=""http://www.eink.com/technology.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.eink.com/technology.html</a>.</p>
<p><b>E Ink does require some charge to change its state. Typically 
how much power will be required from a smartphone battery that's being 
used to change the image?</b><br/></p>
<p>The
 power requirement depends on the smartphone used - the bracelet's 
electronics requires a couple of milliamp for a few seconds - this is an
 insignificant amount compared to the other power needs of the phone. <br/></p>
<p><b>Where can I find more pictures to tag onto my bracelet?</b></p>
<p>We are currently in the process of the developing a #pic market, an app that will allow you to browse and buy or download for free from thousands of picture provided by our artist and designer community. You will also have the option to have your own gallery where you can store your own edited pictures and just simply select one tag it and wear it. </p>
<p>The available designs are practically limitless, as we are drawing upon the creativity and artistic genius of the tago community. </p>
<p><b>Can I use my tago bracelet with my iPhone?</b></p>
<p>For
 those of you with an iPhone out there, tago application is currently 
android only. The iPhone 6 already has the NFC technology in it, it is 
however only enabled by Apple for Apple Pay at the moment. We believe 
that the iPhone community will be able to enjoy the #tago arc feeling in
 the near future as well, as online rumor has it that Apple is 
considering expanding NFC in its future iPhones beyond Apply Pay. For now, you’ll need a smartphone with an android version 4 or later to be able to interact with the tago arc. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions do not hesitate to reach out to us on twitter, facebook or here in the comments.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>#noRisk #noGain - challenges </b></p>
<p>Risk of compatibility </p>
<p>For those of you with an iPhone out there - The tago application is currently android only! For now, you’ll need a smartphone with an android version 4 or later to be able to interact with the tago arc. We hope Apple will make changes to the kernel of the iOS in the future that will make iPhones’ NFC usable for other than Apple Pay (or find a way to bridge the gap through third party apps).</p>
<p>Risk of technology </p>
<p>A drawback of NFC despite its strong advantages is precision. People will have to learn where their NFC chips are located to hold exactly on the marked spot for the energy and picture transfer to be complete. It can be a matter of an inch and the communication may be interrupted. Also the precision decides how quickly the transfer is completed.</p>
<p>Challenge of development</p>
<p>The development of the tago arc test the mettle of our engineers in many ways. To complete the final layout of the hardware parts is no small task, we may even have to order completely custom-built displays in order to integrate them into the bracelet. The material of choice is also a key question and depending on our foreign manufacturer it might change with the progress of the development.</p>

It is simply an awesome jewelry.





Where do I get the pictures for the display you ask? The right answer is the #tago app and our Pic Shop. 
The tago app is currently in the beta testing phase. Here you will have access to the coolest of designs, patterns, drawings to browse and wear for a few dollars. You will also be able to take pictures with your phone, upload it into the tago app to tag it on your wrist. 

As the wearer you will never have to do more than to buy or create an image (or use a freebie), select the image for transfer via the app and hold your phone close to your tago arc. The image and energy transfer works automatically, smooth and fast. It’s important to note, that only pictures from the tago pic market can be transferred to a tago arc bracelet for security reasons.

We believe in the power of community and the creativity such a community holds. For this reason we are inviting every artist, designer to join our community of tago artists. We designed the built-in Pic Shop to provide artists an opportunity to join the tago community and make real bucks.

We will be ready for mass production in late 2015 and we will start shipping early 2016.

Warning tech content! :)
The tago arc integrates existing technologies into a stylish advanced jewelry. E Ink and Near Field Communication (NFC) are both eco-friendly progressive technologies, E Ink displays only needs a little energy to change physical structure, and once changed it could stay that way practically for several years.

Due to E Ink’s capabilities the displayed image will be 16 color greyscale on the bracelet with a smooth pixel density (150 ppi), similar. This means that the display does not have a backlight as eReaders do, the display is not 100% black and white colors. In order to change the displayed picture on the tago arc and transmit enough energy for the device to work, the user has to place his/her smartphone to precisely match both NFC chips, but this will be aided by a positioning system in your app, the image transfer is very straightforward and secure. The tago arc uses NFC instead of Bluetooth, because NFC is easier to use, smoother and consumes less energy overall. NFC induces enough energy during image transfer that the small E Ink display is able to reconstruct the chosen image.


The image transfer interval is currently 15 seconds, depending on the smartphone device and the image complexity when holding the phone precisely to the NFC chip. We’re working on time efficiency to minimize this time interval. Please note that the actual transfer time may increase when NFC chips are not aligned properly.
For
 those of you with an iPhone out there, tago application is currently 
android only. The iPhone 6 already has the NFC technology in it, it is 
however only enabled by Apple for Apple Pay at the moment. We believe 
that the iPhone community will be able to enjoy the #tago arc feeling in
 the near future as well, as online rumor has it that Apple is 
considering expanding NFC in its future iPhones beyond Apply Pay. For now, you’ll need a smartphone or tablet with an android version 4 or later to be able to interact with the tago arc. 
We are obsessed with creating every single inch of the tago arc bracelet insanely perfect. The tago arc is a premium product, with high quality components, during the design and development process we went to great length to ensure that we deliver only the best to our customers. 


We use flexible E Ink displays and flexible hardware for the tago arc, but the arc itself has a fixed shape. We will be manufacturing it in 3 different sizes (S, M and L sizes). The material of the bracelet will be surgical stainless steel with precious metal coating for the standard bracelets and precious metal for the truly silver and gold bracelets.



We also pay special attention to the material choice and the ergonomics of the tago arc to provide a seamless wearing and user experience. Some jewelry materials can cause an allergic reaction to the skin, so we make sure to use only skin-friendly materials. All the materials are durable and withstand deterioration that comes from wearing the bracelet on a daily basis, the E Ink display itself is built from the strongest material, high quality light steel with gold, silver or black finishing.
We entered the final phase of our development and need one last final push for mass production. We need the help of the Indiegogo community to bring tago arc to you and to start production in 2016 and for this we need 40,000 USD. Here’s a graph describing how we’d like to utilize your help:

    Attila Z. Kedei - Junior Developer
As a junior developer I find it challenging to create the most powerful E Ink bracelet ever.  I believe that NFC is the next gen utility to make everyone's life easier. There's nothing better than working with high-tech devices and interesting people all around the world as a part of a startup team.


Work hard, play hard...
*FAQ*
How is it powered if it doesn't need charging?

NFC tags are regarded as passive devices - they operate without a power supply. The same applies for the E Ink technology it does not additional power input to hold the design displayed on it. The NFC tags are reliant on an active device to come into close range before they activate. These active devices are for example your smartphones.  


In order to power these NFC tags, electromagnetic induction is used to create a current in the passive device. We won’t get into too much technical detail-basic principle is that coils of wire can be used to produce electromagnetic waves, which can then be picked up and turned back into current by a another coil of wire. This is very similar to the techniques used for other wireless charging technologies. This EM induction is generated by your smartphone at being held at close range to the #tago arc's NFC tag - which is currently placed on the inside of the bracelet. 
I have an android tablet - does the #tago arc work with a tablet too?
If your tablet is an Android tablet and has the NFC in it, than you can use your tablet as well.
How does the '$99 now the rest later' perk?

Step 1: pay for half of the #tago arc a $99 now
Step 2: return within the next 30 days click on this perk again and pay a $160
Disclaimer: We consider the first half of your payment a down payment for the bracelet, which is not refundable. If you return to our Indiegogo site within 30 days to pay the other half we will be shipping you a #tago arc at the end of 2015. At the finish of our campaign our Indiegogo site will remain live, so that you can pay the second half of your contribution.
Help: If for any reason you cannot pay your remaining $160 balance, we will send you, as thanks for your earlier $99 contribution, a 40% off voucher that you can use at a later time to purchase a #tago arc in our web-shop.
Can I get it in colour?
E Ink can only display greyscale images with the current displays. In fact, there are some coloured E Ink displays on the market today, it’s just not only they’re ridiculously expensive, but also their colours are kind of pale and we decided not to use them until there will be premium quality available of this technology as well. 
How does E Ink work exactly?
If you’re interested to know more about how E Ink works check out this website:http://www.eink.com/technology.html.
E Ink does require some charge to change its state. Typically 
how much power will be required from a smartphone battery that's being 
used to change the image?
The
 power requirement depends on the smartphone used - the bracelet's 
electronics requires a couple of milliamp for a few seconds - this is an
 insignificant amount compared to the other power needs of the phone. 
Where can I find more pictures to tag onto my bracelet?
We are currently in the process of the developing a #pic market, an app that will allow you to browse and buy or download for free from thousands of picture provided by our artist and designer community. You will also have the option to have your own gallery where you can store your own edited pictures and just simply select one tag it and wear it. 
The available designs are practically limitless, as we are drawing upon the creativity and artistic genius of the tago community. 
Can I use my tago bracelet with my iPhone?
For
 those of you with an iPhone out there, tago application is currently 
android only. The iPhone 6 already has the NFC technology in it, it is 
however only enabled by Apple for Apple Pay at the moment. We believe 
that the iPhone community will be able to enjoy the #tago arc feeling in
 the near future as well, as online rumor has it that Apple is 
considering expanding NFC in its future iPhones beyond Apply Pay. For now, you’ll need a smartphone with an android version 4 or later to be able to interact with the tago arc. 
If you have any further questions do not hesitate to reach out to us on twitter, facebook or here in the comments.


#noRisk #noGain - challenges 
Risk of compatibility 
For those of you with an iPhone out there - The tago application is currently android only! For now, you’ll need a smartphone with an android version 4 or later to be able to interact with the tago arc. We hope Apple will make changes to the kernel of the iOS in the future that will make iPhones’ NFC usable for other than Apple Pay (or find a way to bridge the gap through third party apps).
Risk of technology 
A drawback of NFC despite its strong advantages is precision. People will have to learn where their NFC chips are located to hold exactly on the marked spot for the energy and picture transfer to be complete. It can be a matter of an inch and the communication may be interrupted. Also the precision decides how quickly the transfer is completed.
Challenge of development
The development of the tago arc test the mettle of our engineers in many ways. To complete the final layout of the hardware parts is no small task, we may even have to order completely custom-built displays in order to integrate them into the bracelet. The material of choice is also a key question and depending on our foreign manufacturer it might change with the progress of the development.
