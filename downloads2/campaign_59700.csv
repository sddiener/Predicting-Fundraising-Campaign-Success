Henry Ford in the beginning of the 20th century developed automotive industry with one main inspiration:""Design the car which will not be just a commodity for the rich people, make it so cheap that every family can have it""Today, in the 21st century, our vision is not so different than the Henry Ford's philosophy. We want to create an affordable aircraft so that every family in the world can buy one, use it and fly it!
Our vision and mission is to make everyone able to fly. How are we going to do that?

Simplicity and compactness - The STERNA design makes production work flows simple and ready for mass-production.
State of the art technology - Reduces production costs making the STERNA VLA affordable.
End to end solution - Designed to be safe & simple to maintain and easy to operate.
High flight safety - The STERNA design includes installation of an emergency parachute for the entire aircraft (not just individual passengers), fire protection devices and electronic equipment for flight data collecting.
Monitor your flying experience - Flight data collection will enable software support allowing you to analyse your flying experience and enhance it thanks to a series of recommendations.
Significantly lower price (3-4x times) compared to other planes in same category (MVP, Icon). As soon as we start large scale mass production, we'll be able to reduce the price even more!

Join us and you will experience the power of flight.

</b></b><p></p></div>","Millions of people suffer aches and pains sitting in front of computers for long periods time which can lead to depression and stress-related illness.  With a single click, PeakPerformr brings instant relief from discomfort using Award-winning 3D Yoga animation that demonstrates exactly how to stretch, breath and relax any part of the body.  An interactive wellness questionnaire then calculates a wellness score that creates a personal info graph which charts progress and motivates the user to continue using the app.
PeakPerformr was built following an award from Creative England in recognition of the motivational value of the 3D Yoga animation produced by at the world renowned Bournemouth University National Computer Centre for Animation using motion capture software.  The layered process of displaying the position of the skeleton, the muscles being engaged and the breath process created by the developer is unique in the world and is a now a trademark IP asset of the company.
Similar self-improvement apps that use interactive graphics and scores are registering up to 50 million global subscribers who are willing to pay $15 a month to train alongside the content.  Key to this is the scientific evidence generated by research that proves effectiveness of the app in improving health, which is then used extensively in their marketing material.

With your help, we want to emulate this proven business model because during demonstrations of the prototype mobile app at both US & UK Health, Stress and Wellness conferences, we gained an immediate response to  participate in clinical trials from University Psychology professors and multi-national Corporate HR executives to produce scientific evidence of significant ROI health benefits through regular use of PeakPerformr.

Our plan is to use this evidence to drive a powerful marketing campaign for both the retail app and occupational health market which supports the underlying premise of the app, which is that undertaking regular “structured breaks” during the day reduces stress and absenteeism, increases emotional resilience and leads to improved productivity. There is already plenty of research evidence to support this premise which the US National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health has integrated into their branded initiative  entitled “Total Worker Health”.PeakPerformr has been specifically designed to meet this initiative by instantly delivering exercises to perform at any time during the day, using state-of-the-art animation and audio tracks that are effective, with a visually engaging scoring system that encourages self-improvement through self-awareness.
Our goal is to make an inexpensive tool available to employers around the world that is scientifically proven to deliver financial AND health ROI gains to their company.  We want to change the way we work from a seated, static position to a more fluid, active and engaged style which is endorsed by employers.  People need to feel empowered to take charge of their health and the interactive tools contained within the app do just that, encouraging self-awareness with immediate responses to identified problems. PeakPerformr bundles together the best technology to deliver a powerful solution to an identified need shared by millions of people.  Once it has been proven to work, we believe that it will help to create a happier, healthier and and more engaging  global work culture.   What We Need & What You Get 
Earlier test versions of the proprietary 3D animation, developed over 5 years with a £22,000 Angel investment, included a mobile app entitled “Travel Yoga 3D/In the Plane & In the Car”, which received over 5000 downloads; and a demonstration DVD entitled “Office Yoga 3D”, which was tested at the Southampton Oceanographic Institute and generated requests for a desktop app version.
Following the receipt of a Creative England Starter £10K Award to build a prototype version, the company incorporated and produced the desktop app version, which is now available as a free 5-day download through the website: http://peakperformr.com.  The company also received pre-qualification assurance from the UK HMRC to distribute Tax Credits under the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme.

Interview with ICC 360 Cricket Show (International) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tlkGqnfNQk#t=33 I have been fortunate to represent Singapore at international level since 2006, which has exposed me to many people of different countries and cultures - from Australia, South Africa, and to my most recent tour in the Netherlands. I have always wanted to play cricket at a higher level than what is played in Singapore. Cricket in Singapore isn’t very big for ladies (as compared to men) so I have been sourcing out on my own so that I can get more opportunities to play. To begin with I started playing in the men’s league (article 5) so I could get more exposure and whenever given a chance to play overseas I will seek out for sponsors. So far I have been fortunate to go to South Africa and Netherlands because a few companies and clubs sponsored me. ‘Pharmaceutical company called Vetter and Joseph Grimberg (judicial Commissioner of the Supreme Court, Singapore) sponsored me to play in South Africa. HV & CV Quick club in Netherlands sponsored me to play in Netherlands.Unfortunately I missed out on Sri Lanka and Australia last year because I wasn’t able to get sponsorship. I am hoping not to miss the second chance I have been given to play in Sri Lanka and Australia this year.I have already shown promise as Singapore’s leading female cricketer and with my hard work and determination I am confident I will be able to play well in the women’s cricket league in Sri Lanka and Australia.  Hence, I would like to take this opportunity to raise funds for the upcoming leagues in Sri Lanka and Australia.In order to play in Sri Lanka for the season from 21st July to 21st August 2015 (1 month), I need to cover my flight, accommodation, transport, and food expenses.

<p>We are a real family of four with two little girls, Ansley and Addison.  Addison is our youngest and will be turning 1 this December and Ansley will be 4 on Christmas eve.  Mommy and Daddy (aka Katie and Daniel) are high school sweethearts and we continued dating through college even though we went to rival colleges.  We were married shortly after college and a few years after that were blessed with our first little angel.  When Ansley was born it was important to us to give her the best nutrition and upbringing that we could.  Katie was fortunate and able to produce enough milk to keep up with our new feeding machine.  It was also important for Katie to pump and store the milk in case she needed to leave Ansley with a sitter or daddy.  When she started pumping we found the storage and mainly the labeling of the bottles very difficult and a truly archaic process.  We tried sticky notes, dry erase, charting, and even a few clever apps that were out at the time.  None of these methods really seemed to make sense and although some were better than others we really didn't feel like any of these old methods were very simple.  Even IF the sticky notes didn't fall of in the fridge, or you didn't smudge the writing on the bottle, at 3 am it's not easy to do the reverse math to see how long a bottle has been in the fridge even if the dates are clearly written.  So we started thinking of how to make it easier and over the last 3 years we've finally gotten our prototypes COMPLETED and TimerToppy was born!!!  A simple, safe (BPA FREE) way to track how long your milk or forumla has been in the bottle.</p>
<p>Your support in ANY capacity is appreciated beyond what you can ever imagine.  We are launching this IndieGOGO campaign so that we can get the first production run out into the real world helping mommies and daddies like us to make one part of raising these precious angels just a little bit easier.  You can buy some of the tops, show us some love on any social media, or even donate to our cause and wish us the best of luck.  We also want to know what you think of the idea and hear how else the TimerToppy could be used!  </p>
<p></p>
<h3>How Does It Work</h3>
<div>It really very simple.  Once you have finished pumping your milk you remove the pumping adapter and replace it with the TimerToppy. Once the top is on the storage bottle you press the button to start the timer.  The timer will then count up by minutes, hours, and days until you return to use the milk and reset the timer for a new bottle.  Forget about dating and trying to do any math with this top, just read the amount of days, hours, and minutes on the top and then you can quickly determine if the milk is within your comfort level to be served to your precious little one.  We just want to help you remove the guess work from bottle labeling.</div>

<p><b>According to the World...</b></p>
<p>Without
safe-drinking water and basic hygiene education children and their families
place themselves at high risk. Dirty water contains various kinds of bacteria, viral,
and parasitic organisms that make young children (who don't have strong immune
systems) get very sick. Lack of poor hygiene, such as absence of proper hand
washing can also result in severe illness. Diarrhea is both easily preventable
and treatable, all a community needs to solve this situation are the few
basic supplies offered in our simple kit along with an educational echo+
workshop. With these tools, we can literally save hundreds of infants from suffering
a miserable condition. Think of it almost as a first aid kit that enables
families to use simple sanitary practices and treatment education to keep from
getting sick. In many cases, clinics that offer proper care are usually far
away from rural communities we are working with so it is important to give
families the tools to manage the situation at home in case of an emergency. </p>

use open buckets to store water and these can be easily contaminated. For
example, when a person with unwashed hands dips their cup and hand in the bucket
all the water will become dirty. Echo+ is offering a water storage vessel that
comes with a lid and a nozzle. The nozzle is key because instead of reaching
into the clean water supply, they just can turn the knob at the bottom of the
bucket and water will pour our bug-free! </p>

<p>Oral Rehydration Therapy is a life-saving
solution that is cheap, effective, and easy to prepare. It prevents dehydration
among children suffering from mild to severe diarrhea. ORT solution is composed
of: 1 Liter of water, ½ <b>teaspoon</b> of <b>salt</b>, and 5 teaspoons of <b>sugar</b>. The reason a child gets dehydrated
is because the bacteria and parasitic organisms that cause diarrhea damage the
lining in the intestines make an extreme amount of water and electrolytes be released
rather than absorbed. ORT is a glucose-electrolyte solution that promotes water
reabsorption by osmosis. When the Oral rehydration solution reaches the
intestines, the salt and sugar bind together and are able to cross the
intestinal lining. Water immediately follows the high concentration of salt
across the lining, and is once again absorbed back into
the body.  </p>
<p>The sanitary kit provides a <b>1 Liter plastic pitcher</b>, <b>2 teaspoons</b>, plus a package of <b>salt</b> and <b>sugar</b>. We try to make it as easy as possible so that any family
member can prepare this life-saving formula using the correct measurements.</p>
<p>Instructions
and empowerment: </p>
<p>echo+ doesn’t just give out kits, we want to
make sure that families understand how to use them and why it’s so important. For
that reason, the echo+ team travels hundreds of miles to Puno, Peru to provide
educational workshops. These hands-on workshops make it easy to explain our
mission as well as explain the proper use of each item in our kit (also
outlined in our <b>instruction manual</b>).
</p>
<p>echo+ wants to empower children and young
adults as leaders of their community. At the end of each workshop we hand out
medals and ask each new “echo+ leader” to help promote good hygiene practices
in their homes, with their friends and in their communities. </p>
<p><b>The Team</b></p>
<p>The
Echo team is comprised of a thoughtful group of friends and a mix of people who
were originally from Peru, and the United States.  Founded by Alessandra
Koenig and her family, the team also includes Rosanna Zagazeta, Sean
Powell, Martin Pierrend, Eric Koon, Spencer Koon, and Geoff Bonham. </p>
<p><b>The Funding</b></p>
<p>The
funding here will purchase the supplies and assemble the kits. The supplies
will be purchased in Peru to save shipping costs and driven and hand delivered
to Puno where they will be delivered by the Echo team.  The more we raise,
the more kits we can provide.  Hopefully we can make much more than our
$1000 goal and provide for many more kids out there in the area.</p>

<p>The
fiscal sponsor for this project is The Mary Powell Foundation, a registered

This is an opportunity to be part of a wellness movement by supporting innovation and a company whose mission is to make things better for you and someone you know.
FUNKSH is committed to using innovation and technology to improve health and well-being for every day life and strives to provide the world with safe, effective, and affordable products that promote Health & Wellness.
Objective:
PRE-ORDER, CONTRIBUTE and SHARE our indiegogo project to fund production of the first element, FUNKSH 360: the world's first adjustable smoking device.


The 360 and three development stage products are chameleons. Despite the powerful impact these tools can have if instructions are followed, they are subtle and blend easily into the environment. 



Innovator:
Kyle Vincent Boisselle

With over 16 years combined experience as a ""best of breed"" specialist in Health and Wellness, Fitness and Technology, I've been fortunate to have represented some of the worlds most innovative manufacturers and to have worked with and learned many things from world class athletes, doctors and other technical specialists. 
My passion and inspiration has come from witnessing the transformation in people’s lives when combining the correct tools and techniques.
Company:
FUNKSH is both my philosophy and now an extension of my professional evolution as an innovator powered by the combination of my experience, inspiration and motivation to make life better for all.
Evolution:

Although FUNKSH innovates and utilizes technology of the present and embraces those of the future, it also remains a throwback to a time when quality meant something.
It also stands as a symbol to remind us of our humanity amidst the ever changing world we live in, connecting us. Teaching us. Moving forward. Better tools are a part of global progress and this is one of them. Two further concepts will roll out at a layer date to be determined. 

Innovation & Design:
The  design has evolved over the last few years and now is truly a well rounded SOLUTION for smokers in that
it's overall performance, portability, design and function, are still unparalleled to this day. 

The FUNKSH 360 IS the first handheld tool of its kind, which both reduces the
harmful effects of smoking on the body and puts in your hand in an innovative, simple and practical design
that addresses the shortcomings of other methods.








The Device:
Crafted from surgical grade stainless steel, the device is both indestructible and waterproof. It's equipped with a unique valve design that allows for a smooth controlled inhalation, you decide. 
After all the R & D we've done, the 360 provides unparalleled value, simplicity, functionality and efficiency in the palm of your hand. It's round, requires rotational movements only for operation and it's a solution. It truly is a modern tool for every smoker. The device includes a kit to keep things organized for storage and travel.
Q-tips and sanitizer or nail polish clean the device in minutes. Completely clean and clearly an indication you are choosing a scientific approach. 
It has a weight and feel to it that really set it apart from what you're used to seeing. This is a finely crafted instrument. Some new images to come with the logo engraved on the device. They look really nice with engraving. 






Indestructible







Waterproof






Air Control/Airflow

     X-ray vision reveals: It's designed and inspired from the inside out.  When it became apparent that internal design resulted in a smooth and potent experience, the exterior was eventually further designed with the same philosophy in mind. Form and function. Acting both as a vault to your cargo and a valve control for the right air flow it's undeniably smooth and secure. Drop it in your purse or pocket and it's ready when you are. 
Specifications:



316L surgical stainless steel, passivated & polished.
CNC Machining
Weight: .415 lbs / 6.64 ounces
Dimensions: 3 x 1 x 1.5 inches 
3 pieces (stem,base,cap)
Waterproof & air tight
Warranty: Lifetime Guarantee

Passivation: Stainless steels are corrosion-resistant by nature, the added passivation assures that the metal is less affected by environmental factors such as air and water. Passivation involves a shielding outer-layer which can be applied as a microcoating, is a light coat of a protective material that creates a shell against corrosion. This technique is used to strengthen and preserve the appearance of the metal. 
Inspiration & History:


In 2009, I watched a Canadian documentary featuring Greg Cooper, a patient suffering from multiple sclerosis and severe ataxia. It was gripping to watch and while it struck me that the device in my hand, would have allowed the clip to continue. It was the first time I recognized the true therapeutic benefits of the pipe I'd created for myself a year earlier. As a non smoker, I reasoned that I would need to control the heat and airway for my inhalation. I had resisted the urge to smoke most of my life based on a few bad experiences, but the device helped me to utilize it therapeutically. Due to the number of people who tried the pipe in the following year and claimed it was the smoothest pipe they had ever smoked, I became obsessed with researching other existing devices and then developing the product further to ensure it provided both an efficient and functional solution for it's owner.  There are dozens of prototypes in the hands of patients and friends around the globe who, like me, swear by it.

Opportunity:
For you, the contributors, the opportunity to improve the
quality of life for millions of people is tangible by being a part of this campaign. This is just the beginning.
Pricing has been discounted for the purpose of this campaign, delivery and handing charges are extra. The device pays for itself, but we'll group ship where we can.


I am looking to raise
a total of $50,000 to jump-start manufacturing, company expansion and further product development.

The financial support
of the contributors means much more than purchasing a product, manufacturing or launching a company. It is a part of the evolving global wellness movement of empowering the individual to be in charge of their physical and mental health. With each innovation planned for release, it is highly likely someone you know will experience an improved quality and duration of life, due to one of three elements being rolled out by FUNKSH.
The campaign will provide the opportunity for people to own a lifelong smoking device that reduces the harmful effects of existing devices and additionally as a tribute to Greg Cooper (Canada), my friend Larry Quinn (USA) and all patients world wide, the contributors will be able to donate the devices to patients and care-giving organizations through the ""featured perk"" listed at the very top of the page. 
And most importantly all contributors will receive a listing on our Founders Page found at FUNKSH.com

<p>Hello. The girl you see in the photo above is my daughter Amanda. She turned 5 on the 28th of November. </p>
<p>I wish I could say that her 5 years have been as any other child. But, I cannot.</p>
<p>Amanda suffers from Hypotonia, development delay and obstipation. She recently has had a diagnosis of Functional Constipation complicated by hypotonia. She is in the mere 5th percentile for her weight which is only 30lbs. She has speech, physical and occupational delays. She has been 'tracked' as being mentally and physically able of a compared 2 yr 8 month child.</p>
<p>Amanda has always had trouble with having bowel movements. From a young age, 1-2 months, I would see her struggling much more than an infant would. I brought it to her Pediatricians attention numerous times with no help. </p>
<p>At approximately 1 year of age Amanda started having bowel movements less and less. She would strain, cry and scream to get it out with nothing more than tiny pellets and blood. Thus is when the roller coaster of this poor childs life began.</p>
<p>Because of her delays in speech, she was unable to communicate her needs or struggles. But it became all too obvious with the lack of stool and destended stomach. I brought her to the Hospital ER where they tried everything from manual removal to fleet enemas with no result. I remember the Doctor saying, ""My goodness, she has a lot of stool in there"" when reading the x-rays. So it was no wonder I was shocked when they ordered us home with a regimen of laxitives, suppositories and 2 enemas per day.</p>
<p>I followed their advice. I cried daily with my child as she screamed with the invasive torment I delivered. And for what? More pain and pellets.</p>
<p>I will not tell you the amount of medications and procedures I was told to do to my child throughout the next couple of years. It was horrific. Finally, I said enough and more had to be done. I was (after much insistance) referred to a Gastrointestinal Specialist.</p>
<p>Within the last 2 years of Amandas life she has had numerous NG-tube clean outs (tube through her nose that delivers high amounts of Golytly into her stomach), Gastric Barium enemas, Disimpactions, biopsies of her rectum, and the latest being Botox injections into her rectum. The Botox was to relax her anal sphincter so that basically the stool would just ""fall out."" Again this has failed. She has done all of this along with her treatments for her delays and hypotonia. She has such anxiety of going to the doctor now that she has been diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety. I am now bringing her to a Psychologist once a week to cope.</p>
<p>But a wonderful thing has happened! Amanda has been referred to a Motility Specialist.   <a href=""http://www.chw.org/display/PPF/DocID/48891/Nav/1/router.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.chw.org/display/PPF/DocID/48891/Nav/1/router.asp</a></p>
<p>There are only a few in the USA and the closest to us is in Milwaukee WI. It is approx 874 miles away. We are to arrive on the 28th of Decmeber and stay until that Monday for results.</p>
<p>This specialist is a bleesing for us. We will finally get the answers she needs. Possibly a cure?</p>
<p>I have never used the 'single-mom' as an excuse. I work hard and do the best to provide for my children (I have one other daughter who is 14).

We are hoping to take Pink Weddings NATIONWIDE!!!  To give FREE weddings to those who have and are being affected by Cancer!  We are like the Wedding Version of the Make a Wish for Grownups! ;)  We comprise a list of Vedors who will donate what they can of themselves(trade) and then we have to find a way to do the rest!  </span></h3>
<h3><strong><span class=""text-class-43""><span>We are raising money to get Pink Weddings OFF the ground!  This will help us cover expenses for the Pink Weddings that we just cannot get Vendors to donate in their services!  </span></span></strong></h3>
<h3>************************************************</h3>
<h2>
<strong>From: Pink Weddings</strong><br/><strong>We the founders of Pink Weddings are Reverend Kimberly Kelly and Shelley Chamberlin; we are the founders of the newly formed Pink Weddings. We are an organization that has gathered a group of various weddings vendors (and growing nationwide) to donate their services to those who are terminally ill with any cancer or who are within a 7 year window of remission. We are also open to case by case situations that could affect the children of these patients. </strong><br/><strong>We are also taking other terminally ill clients as well.</strong>
</h2>
<h2><strong>We freely take nominations from family, friends, agencies, and the couples themselves. We do require a diagnosis from a medical doctor that is verifiable just to ensure that they are receiving the proper services as well as arrangements for them when their wedding day ar-rives.</strong></h2>

<span>Here is a copy of a few heartfelt words I shared with our guest! Thank you all again from the bottom of our hearts! </span><br/><br/><span>Take a walk with me if you will… and put yourself in the shoes of someone who is sick or in love with someone who is sick… </span><br/><span>The big question I have for you through all of these stories are; what would it mean to you? </span><br/><span>….If</span><br/><span>The love of you</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">r life was facing their eternity without you and your life here without them. Would you want the opportunity to give them your name or take the name of that special one? Would you want to know that you have shown the ultimate gift of love before the ultimate and final goodbye, by marrying that special person? On the other hand, what if they have fought so hard to overcome their illness into remission and you would like to do nothing but marry them and spend the rest of your life with them as the ultimate reward of a second chance of life. Nevertheless, the illness that you now have put behind you has left you with memories of a savings account, memories of extra money, and only dreams in the wind of affording the fairy tale wedding that both people deserve. What if you have the chance to do that because a group of very special, loving people decided to give of themselves to put the stars back in the eyes of the couple in love and the dreams and hope back into the hearts of those who dare to dream because illness is smoldering their futures. <br/><br/>Or what if you have been with that special someone for 25 years of wonderful marriage, children, and then grandchildren and suddenly illness strikes within the home… what if you fought the fight and find that your time was running near? In addition, you knew that all she wanted for the last 15 years was to renew your wedding vows by doing the wedding ceremony she always wished you could have afforded when you first wed… Now that illness has touched your lives, that dream again has been stolen. On the other hand, has it? Again, what if you knew that you could turn to Pink Weddings to give your wife the wedding that she always wanted and deserved… <br/><br/>We all make plans to grow old together; but many couples that will not get to. Also, we all make plans to do things like get married, or renew our vows to show our special someone that we are truly committed to them and to give them the ultimate gift of love. But then again, truly have you ever thought outside of watching a tearjerker movie what happens in real life when illness strikes and interrupts those plans. Well, I will tell you what happens… There are several scenarios… <br/>Scenario One- The couple does not get to get married at all or renew their vows. <br/>Scerario Two- The couple does get married by the hospital chaplain, their pastor in their living room/ hospital room, or a family or friend attempts to put together a wedding on no money budget to try and help a friend. <br/>Scenario Three- They come to Pink Weddings and they get to have their dreams come true. Now, we may not be able to give them the Cinderella Carriage and the several thousand dollar wedding gown, but we can offer them as close to perfect as possible. <br/><br/>Weddings Professionals, do you remember why you went into business in the wedding industry? Probably because it was some decent income to make in it, right? Well, do you remember WHY you stayed in it? I know why I stayed in it; as I am addicted to the Love Stories! I am obviously a helpless romantic who cannot help but be head over heels in love with the LOVE that these couple brings with them. I cannot imagine what it will be like to experience the first Pink Wedding… How exciting will that be. <br/></span>

We are raising money to get Pink Weddings OFF the ground!  This will help us cover expenses for the Pink Weddings that we just cannot get Vendors to donate in their services!  
************************************************

From: Pink WeddingsWe the founders of Pink Weddings are Reverend Kimberly Kelly and Shelley Chamberlin; we are the founders of the newly formed Pink Weddings. We are an organization that has gathered a group of various weddings vendors (and growing nationwide) to donate their services to those who are terminally ill with any cancer or who are within a 7 year window of remission. We are also open to case by case situations that could affect the children of these patients. We are also taking other terminally ill clients as well.

We freely take nominations from family, friends, agencies, and the couples themselves. We do require a diagnosis from a medical doctor that is verifiable just to ensure that they are receiving the proper services as well as arrangements for them when their wedding day ar-rives.

Additionally to find us on facebook you can follow us and keep up with all of the exciting things happening! Facebook.com/pinkweddings and our website is www.dreamalittledreamweddings and click on the Pink Weddings Tab(s).

***************************************

Here is a copy of a few heartfelt words I shared with our guest! Thank you all again from the bottom of our hearts! Take a walk with me if you will… and put yourself in the shoes of someone who is sick or in love with someone who is sick… The big question I have for you through all of these stories are; what would it mean to you? ….IfThe love of your life was facing their eternity without you and your life here without them. Would you want the opportunity to give them your name or take the name of that special one? Would you want to know that you have shown the ultimate gift of love before the ultimate and final goodbye, by marrying that special person? On the other hand, what if they have fought so hard to overcome their illness into remission and you would like to do nothing but marry them and spend the rest of your life with them as the ultimate reward of a second chance of life. Nevertheless, the illness that you now have put behind you has left you with memories of a savings account, memories of extra money, and only dreams in the wind of affording the fairy tale wedding that both people deserve. What if you have the chance to do that because a group of very special, loving people decided to give of themselves to put the stars back in the eyes of the couple in love and the dreams and hope back into the hearts of those who dare to dream because illness is smoldering their futures. Or what if you have been with that special someone for 25 years of wonderful marriage, children, and then grandchildren and suddenly illness strikes within the home… what if you fought the fight and find that your time was running near? In addition, you knew that all she wanted for the last 15 years was to renew your wedding vows by doing the wedding ceremony she always wished you could have afforded when you first wed… Now that illness has touched your lives, that dream again has been stolen. On the other hand, has it? Again, what if you knew that you could turn to Pink Weddings to give your wife the wedding that she always wanted and deserved… We all make plans to grow old together; but many couples that will not get to. Also, we all make plans to do things like get married, or renew our vows to show our special someone that we are truly committed to them and to give them the ultimate gift of love. But then again, truly have you ever thought outside of watching a tearjerker movie what happens in real life when illness strikes and interrupts those plans. Well, I will tell you what happens… There are several scenarios… Scenario One- The couple does not get to get married at all or renew their vows. Scerario Two- The couple does get married by the hospital chaplain, their pastor in their living room/ hospital room, or a family or friend attempts to put together a wedding on no money budget to try and help a friend. Scenario Three- They come to Pink Weddings and they get to have their dreams come true. Now, we may not be able to give them the Cinderella Carriage and the several thousand dollar wedding gown, but we can offer them as close to perfect as possible. Weddings Professionals, do you remember why you went into business in the wedding industry? Probably because it was some decent income to make in it, right? Well, do you remember WHY you stayed in it? I know why I stayed in it; as I am addicted to the Love Stories! I am obviously a helpless romantic who cannot help but be head over heels in love with the LOVE that these couple brings with them. I cannot imagine what it will be like to experience the first Pink Wedding… How exciting will that be.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>Maurice is a 37-year old loving father and husband who is always helping others; even at the expense of himself. But now Maurice needs help. He needs the help of others to pay for his medical and recovery expenses that will occur when he undergoes a kidney transplant in September. He has insurance; but insurance doesn’t cover all of the expenses. Plus, there are already pre-existing medical bills that have occurred over the course of this journey. I ask that you please open your heart as you continue to read this rest of this campaign.</p>
<p>In 2005, Maurice went to the doctor for a routine physical examination. The doctor noticed traces of blood in his urine and ordered further testing. He spent three days in the hospital being tested. During that time, he was informed that he had Chronic Kidney Failure. Maurice had been born with 1 functioning kidney, and it was failing. Despite the news, Maurice remained upbeat. He continued to live as he normally would - working and caring for his family and friends.</p>
<p>At the end of 2008; with the decline of the economy Maurice found himself unemployed. He actively looked for employment, but had not luck. To make matters worse, in 2009 I became unemployed as well. I was fortunate to regain employment a few months later, but at a lower salary and without benefits.</p>
<p>In October 2010, Maurice went to the doctor’s for another checkup. The next day he was informed that his kidney had 0% functionality and was ordered to go the hospital and have himself admitted. He was admitted and spent the next 11 days in the hospital. During that time he underwent immediate surgery to have a port inserted in his carotid artery of his neck. The port would be how he would receive his dialysis treatments until his veins properly formed for a fistula. Once he was discharged; he found himself with thousands of dollars in hospital expenses.</p>
<p>The search for a donor began immediately. Several family members and friends were tested – and no one viable donor emerged. Maurice went on the donor list and until a suitable donor was found, began dialysis treatments. For the past year and a half, Maurice has been undergoing home dialysis 4-5 hours a day, 6 days a week. His life, as well as that of his family, has revolved around his dialysis schedule.</p>
<p>Last month, his cousin Jamal stepped forward to get tested. Jamal, is a perfect match and will be donating one of his kidneys to save Maurice’s life.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The surgery will take place sometime in either October 17th or November 7th of  this year. After the surgery Maurice will have to be incapacitated for 30-45 days recovering. During this time, he will be constantly monitored to make sure that his body will not reject Jamal’s Kidney. He will also have to have round the clock assistance and care; so either a nurse will be required or his wife will have to take an unpaid leave of absence.</p>
<p>Jamal will also have to stay at the hospital for about a week after surgery to be sure that everything is going to be okay then he will get to return home. However, he cannot return to work for approximately 3-4 weeks depending on his recovery. Jamal has a job, however it does not offer any paid leave benefits.</p>
<p>Once the doctors clear Maurice, he can then go back to living life as normal. However, he will have to remain on medications for the rest of his life, in order to keep his body from ever rejecting the kidney.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that this has been hard on everyone involved. Friends and family are helping out in any way possible, but the financial burden has become too great. We have depleted their savings; and face going into debt even further when the surgery takes place.</p>
<p>We are seeking money they need in order to help them out during their time of stay at the hospital &amp; with the expenses associated with recovery. So, with immense gratitude, we humbly reach out to the people of the world for a donation to support this campaign. We plead that you find it in your heart to help us ease Maurice’s financial burdens.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are not quite sure about how much money will be needed in order to take care of Maurice and Jamal during and after the transplant, but we were told the estimated cost is greater than $20,000. With this campaign we are hoping to raise a portion of this and have set our goal at $12,000. This money will go to cover both Maurice &amp; Jamal medical and recovery expenses not covered by insurance. Any money received in excess of our goal will be donated to other campaigns. We are not asking for a free handout; just need a little help. If you are not able give a donation, I would like to ask that you please keep them in your prayers.</p>
<p>Besides our undying gratitude, there are several perks being offered at various donation levels.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We would like to ask that everyone who reads this to please share this with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, My Space, etc. Let’s all try to get the word out. If you are not able to make a donation, you can still help out with your prayers &amp; telling or sharing this with others.</p>
<p>Thank You all for everything &amp; GOD Bless You !</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>My name is Nicole, Iâ€™m 43 and a mother of 2.  Most of my adult life Iâ€™ve focused on my career.  Over the last 3 years thru a series of changes I have taken a new direction in the way at which I live my life.  My focus turned from career to family and self exploration.  In doing this I fell into an obsession of bike riding. It started as a different way to get my daily exercise then grew into racing and more recently long distance challenges.  Over 2 years ago my average ride would be about 25 miles.  Today my rides reach and slightly exceed 100 miles.  As a middle aged woman and not being the youngest of many in this male dominated world it became more than just daily exercise.  Biking to me became a refuge, a place to think, reflect, plan and basically regroup. I although have become more competitive as the years have gone by.  Pushing myself harder and harder.  About 2 months ago I took a long shot and applied for The Anne Marie McSweeney Scholarship, which included a week PAC Arizona training camp.  Being so new the this obsession and trust me long distance cycling is an obsession I never thought I would be chosen out of the many applicants.  To my amazement I was notified that I indeed was awarded the scholarship.  I was filled with excitement, fear and feeling of accomplishment.  The scholarship focuses on long distance womenâ€™s cycling.  This scholarship was created to carry on and hopefully spread the word of women cyclist.  Iâ€™m proud to be representing Anne Marie spirit for riding.  This will be a great and memorable event in my cycling adventures.  The scholarship provides to me the training camp tour and all training event and seminars, accommodations, breakfast and lunch.  The things that is does not cover is the travel to and from camp and energy supplements for rides and evening food expenses.  I signed up for the Century Week at which we will be riding from 60-100 miles per day for a period of 6 days.   In order for me to attend this camp in honor of Anne Marie I will need to pull together enough private sponsors.  Iâ€™m reaching out to family, friends and fellow cyclers that would like to support me in carrying on the spirit of Anne Marie and her passion for cycling, which I too share with her.<br/><br/></p>

<h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3>
<p>Total funding needed for this is $1,600.  This will provide transportation to and from NY airport, Flight from NY to Arizona, bike rental, energy supplements for the rides themselves and any additional expenses<br/></p>

And yes, that uncomfortable feeling comes from the possibility of illness by bacteria existing in that environment.We cannot see micro-organisms like bacteria, germs & other contaminants with the naked eye. Indeed, we can only see objects as small as about 0.1 millimeters.Many illness, infection, and other hygiene problems come from bacteria.You may have heard of some of the most popular ones: Colon Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Salmonella.When we get infected by these bacteria, it could be terribly dangerous due to their contagious nature.It all starts with personal hygiene; by sterilizing the most used items, we can significantly decrease the possibility of infections, etc. Last year, we launched 'Cleanty v1', and got a lot of love from early adaptors in Kickstarter.And now, we cameback with a new version of Cleanty!With upgraded UVC LED, COOL DESIGN & ADDITIONAL FUNCTION.You can experience the most powerful sterilization with the smallest mobile sterilizer.Just Click and Clean anytime anywhere.Cleanty is the most easy and simple way to keep you safe.Keep Bacteria & Germs away with CleantyKill 99.9% of bacteria, germs, and other contaminants. Cleanty is made with the newest UVC LED technology. With a stroke of UVC LED light, within seconds, it will sterilizes anything around you! Fight and Kill Bacteria in most simple wayDon't be scared of What-Cannot-Be-Seen anymore! Simple One Button Operation : We did not want to install safety like a pistol while maintaining a easy, simple one button solution.

</div></div>","Campaign Update:Hi Everyone, we want to take this opportunity to thank you for the overwhelming interest and enthusiasm. Thanks to your amazing support, we are now sold out with reservations for our first 7,000 pair. We have reached capacity and are no longer accepting pre orders, but will focus on fulfillment and improving our supply chain to deliver your Parásoles as smoothly as possible. For those who missed out on our limited first batch, we are sorry. Thanks for your understanding as we grow to better meet the demand. We promise to be back soon with new options and colors. Please keep in touch for the latest news and release dates through our social media and at parasolesocks.com Parasoles are the world's first 3D recovery footwear that combine the comfort and freedom of a compression sock with key properties of a supportive insole, and traction and protection of an outsole.Our Patent Pending technology is engineered with a generative designed polymer sole providing dynamic arch support, improved pressure distribution, and micro-cushioning. Foot pain can have a profound impact on quality of life. A recent survey by The American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) found that 77% of Americans have experienced foot pain and 51% have limited activity because of foot pain.Many turn to insoles or prescription orthotics to help alleviate the pain, which is great, but what happens when we take off our shoes? We are left with an unsupported fatigued foot, which causes us to walk awkwardly while trying to avoid the pain, or look for the closest place to sit down and get off our feet.
Office & After Work
We all love our socks but have always wished they could be more, and we could wear them in more places. 
After Training & Recovery
On-the-Go/Travel
Leisure Wear
 Parásoles help adapt the natural curves of your feet to the hard flat ground around you. The added utility of the polymer sole improves traction on slippery floors, and protects sock fibers from abrasion while relaxing inside or playing outside.
Casual Wear Outside

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Chris owner operator and head trainer with EliteFitnessGroup.ca. I have been training clients to effectively reach their goal for the last nine years. I have worked with clients of many different backgrounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beginners looking to lose weight</li>
<li>Intermediates looking to step it up</li>
<li>Advanced athletes looking to take their game to the next level</li>
<li>People looking to change their habits to live a healthier happier life</li>
</ul>
<p>I started in the fitness industry because I lost my father at the age of six to a massive heart attack due to being overweight with a poor diet. I had the experience of growing up with a single mother struggling to care for two boys. As soon as I was old enough, I made the decision that I wanted a career in preventing this from happening to other people - so I chose health and fitness.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<p>Currently, I am buidling my already growing client base as well as people intrested in belonging to EFG and the studio I'm looking to open. What I'm looking for is your help with the funding to open my dream studio. We will be starting small but growing together. It will take time but anything worth having always does. I will be dedicating a wall to everyone who helps begin this startup where I will put any name you send me on the wall. It will be know as the lifesaver wall. As the gym builds, I'm going to be printing t-shirts and hoodies and you will receive one of your choice. </p>
<ul>
<li>We're looking to raise $20,000 for first and last rent along with some equipment to start off with (as I currently own some to begin with already)</li>
<li>If we don't reach our target funding we will continue to work with our private clientele until we raise the necessary funds. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Difference Maker</h3>
<p>I'm sure you're wondering what makes this gym different from any other? Well, first it's community: with the network of people I have met though my last nine years in the field, we have the ability to offer all types of fitness and alternative health options. We also have a large client base ready to join as soon as we are up and running. The other difference is our structure: our membership will be slightly more expensive at the basic level (only about 10-15 dollars extra per month). However, every member gets a free workout program and nutrition guide based on the outcome they want from a certified trainer every month to make sure they are getting the changes from the gym they want to see. Successful clients are happy and <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>consistent</strong></span> clients. </p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As I have worked on putting this campaign together it has been very hard for me to put it into words.  My biggest struggle is how do you vocalize a dream that is so incredibly simple?  For 18 years of my life I walked, I stood, I ran, I did all of it and I never thought twice about it, it was so incredibly simple.  Now here I am and it is one of my biggest dreams, something that for over 18 years of my life was second nature.  That memory of walking has faded for me, at times it feels so distant that it is hard to imagine that I ever did walk.</span><br/></p>
<p>Now over five years later, I have decided that it is time to beat the odds and redefine mobility.  When I was paralyzed doctors, society and everything around me told me that I would have to learn to move about on four wheels and that was that, but that isn’t it, there are other options.  Options that allow me to stand up right, options that allow me to “walk” into a room and see my loved ones eye to eye for the first time in five years.  This is a dream that I have had for years but I have been fearful to chase.  I was diagnosed a T10 complete paraplegic (meaning I have no feeling or function from about my belly button down).  I guess for me I never thought it was possible for me to get up and walk again but I was wrong, I can and I will but I need your help to do it.</p>

<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">This Is What It Takes</span></strong></h2>
<p>Now many of you may be asking yourself how is a girl who is paralyzed going to get up and walk? Well, that is a very good question.  I have been diagnosed as a T10 complete paraplegic and my condition is stable and has been for the past five years.  My doctors have informed me that I will not regain function and that is not the purpose of going into this program at Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan.  What I will be doing though is learning how to use what I do have in my upper body to move my legs forward.  I will be fitted with leg braces that will lock out my knee joints out and fix my ankles at 90 degrees and then I will use my core and upper body to “swing” my legs forward.  I will also be using either forearm crutches or a walker to stabilize myself.  Now, this isn’t the graceful one foot in front of another that I used to do, however, it is still me up right on my feet moving towards something.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, insurance doesn’t cover the costs.  In order for me to achieve this dream of new mobility, this dream of “walking” I will be relocating to Detroit for an extended period of time (at least 4 weeks) to work with the Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan.  In order to do this I need to raise $50,000.  That money will go to cover the customized leg braces, the program costs (since my insurance doesn’t cover them) and costs associated with my stay in Detroit throughout this process. </p>
<p>I know that $50,000 is a lot of money but I don’t want to stop there.  Although my goal is listed at $50,000 I want to raise beyond that.  I don’t just want to raise enough for me to walk, I want to raise enough so I can grant money out to other individuals like myself so they too can afford to chase their dream of new mobility.  Even if that means it is just one other person I want to know that this message and story went beyond me.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Impact</span></strong></h2>
<p>Five years ago after I was paralyzed I created a dream, a dream of Paralympic Gold.  I grew up a competitive swimmer, I actually started swimming competitively at the age of 7 and when I was paralyzed at 18 I thought my days of swimming were over.  Less then 4 months after my paralysis I got back in the water and I created that dream, a dream that many said was impossible, until September 2, 2012 when I sat on the podium in London and saw our flag raised and heard the United States of America's national anthem play as I was presented with my gold medal.  That day I put all the doubters to rest.  That day I had achieved a dream of mine, but I didn’t do it alone.  I had a world of supporters behind me that allowed me to achieve that dream and this dream is very similar.  I have had people tell me everything that I won’t do again, one of the most obvious is that I will never walk again, but they are wrong and this is our chance to prove that.  This is our chance to give other individuals the hope that they too can walk someday.  This is our chance to leave an impact, to make a difference and to change the world. </p>
<p>I grew up with a father that told my sisters and I, “You are the best.  You can make a difference.  You can change the world.” Over the past five years I have taken those words to heart.  Those words are what motivate me to do what I do on a daily basis and throughout this campaign I truly believe that we all have the ability to do just that. </p>
<p>It is my goal to keep all of you informed and as this campaign unfolds continue to share my story with you.  I have created a blog that I will be posting on a couple times a week throughout the campaign and beyond. </p>
<p>I know this may seem simple, it may even seem small to some but the freedom that comes with being able to simply stand up and place on foot in front of the other is something that I have learned first hand we can’t take for granted.  It is so easy to get wrapped up in life and forget about the little things but it is my hope that if anything this allows everyone to slow down, even if for just five minutes and take it all in, appreciate the little things, because you never know when it can all change. </p>
<p>So please help me in making this dream come true for me and others out there like myself.  Help us enjoy the simplest joy of walking. </p>

My Story






January
21, 2008 my world completely changed.  I was 18 years old and just two
months away from turning 19, I had just graduated high school the previous June
and in a moment everything I knew changed.  I walked into a medical clinic
to receive an epidural injection for back pain and I never walked out.  I
walked in a healthy 18-year-old girl full of life and hope for what my future
would offer and instead of walking out that afternoon I was admitted to the
hospital because I had lost all feeling and movement from my belly button down;
I was paralyzed.  It has been over five years since that day and I haven’t
walked since that morning. 
For months
I was determined that I would walk again until all the sudden the reality set
in that I was paralyzed and I would never walk again.  I dreamed of what
it would be like to put one foot in front of the other again, what it would be
like to be able to simply stand up, to walk into a room and see my loved ones
eye to eye.  I have dreamed of that day for years and here I am over five
years later and I am ready to make that dream a reality but I can’t do it
alone; I need your help. 






As I have worked on putting this campaign together it has been very hard for me to put it into words.  My biggest struggle is how do you vocalize a dream that is so incredibly simple?  For 18 years of my life I walked, I stood, I ran, I did all of it and I never thought twice about it, it was so incredibly simple.  Now here I am and it is one of my biggest dreams, something that for over 18 years of my life was second nature.  That memory of walking has faded for me, at times it feels so distant that it is hard to imagine that I ever did walk.

You have probably heard the statistics: nearly 1 billion people around the world without access to clean water, 2 billion without access to adequate sanitation.  But you might not have heard the other, equally alarming side of the story.  Water projects that are installed often do not last beyond a few years.  The International Institute for Environment and Development estimates that anywhere from 30-60% of community water projects do not last beyond 5 years, while WaterAid estimates that 1 in 3 water pumps in the developing world aren't functioning at any given time.Nobody really knows the actual numbers behind failure rates, since long-term monitoring of projects is rare.  When projects fail, communities revert to unsafe water sources and open defecation, and the cycle of inequity continues. All the while, aid continues to pour into traditional water and sanitation projects around the world (UN Water estimates that roughly $8 billion dollars of aid was provided in 2010 alone).  Here are some additional resources that illustrate just how widespread the problem is:

Handpump data from the Rural Water and Sanitation Network


Additional resources and statistics on the problem worldwide

What is MoMo?We are developing and deploying a low-cost, low-power solution to monitor the functionality of water infrastructure remotely in the developing world.  MoMo (Mobile Monitor) is a mobile device that attaches to critical infrastructure and reports automatically via text message how the systems are used and when projects break or are abandoned.MoMo is affordable, simple, and flexible, allowing workers in the field to install the product quickly, connect a variety of sensors and communicate data via the mobile network.  With MoMo, local governments, aid organizations, and individual donors will be able to easily check whether aid projects are still functioning from any computer or cell phone.  Anyone from a repairman in Tanzania to a private donor in the U.S. can check on the status of projects they're interested in with the click of a button.  When a facility breaks down or goes unused, local governments and donors will be immediately alerted, ensuring that no project goes unrepaired or left abandoned without notice.MoMos are:
Open Source: our designs are freely available so anyone can build their own MoMo.
Low Power: we designed the device to run on cell phone batteries and last for long periods without maintenance
Low Cost:  we have reduced our cost of materials to below $50 so that MoMos are affordable to those who need them in poor communities
Flexible:  the device can connect to a variety of sensors in a plug-and-play fashion and send data via the mobile network.

I am the founder of Sante Haiti. As someone who grew up in Haiti, I experienced first-hand what it means to not have access to basic health care. Thank goodness, I never had any major illness. However, this is not the case for a good portion of the population. Knowing that fact has put a strong desire in my heart to go back to Haiti and help as best as I can. Since starting medical school, I have been going to Haiti with friends at least once a year to provide basic healthcare in the community where I grew up, Martissant, a suburb of Port-au-Prince. </font></span></span></span></span></p>

It is the guiding principle of our work. We see health as a human right that should be enjoyed by all and it is our mission to do all we can to ensure that the men, women and children of Haiti are able to enjoy this right. We provide <em>sante pou tout moun</em> through service, partnership, education and empowerment.<br/><br/>Our vision is to lessen existing healthcare inequalities by improving access to essential medical services within communities. We aim to highlight the importance of primary prevention through promoting healthy lifestyles and supporting community members in reaching and maintaining their health-related goals.<br/>We are committed to working in partnership with members of the community and with supporting agencies to reach these objectives.<br/></font></span></span></p>
<p align=""justify""><font color=""#000000""><font><font color=""#000000"" size=""2"">It is our belief that education leads to empowerment and as public health physicians we are strongly dedicated to teaching. We lead several community talks on public health issues and have seen, first hand, the value of teaching/training in empowering individuals and communities. A major component of our work also involves training health workers, nurses in particular, for the continuity of care.<br/></font><br/></font></font></p>

<p align=""justify""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: inherit;""><font color=""#000000"" size=""2"">The program was initiated in the summer of 2008 where in less than 3 days, over 400 patients were seen for blood pressure checks, distribution of vitamins and education on public health issues in Martissant. The following year, over 1,000 patients were seen in Martissant, Delmas, Aux Cayes, Cap Haitien by our group. We have nurses that follow-up with those patients bi-weekly. The people we see are always looking forward to our return to Haiti.  They constantly ask us to come more often so they can get a chance to see a healthcare professional more than once a year without having to worry about cost. In this spirit, we are planning on continuing and expanding the project, traveling to Haiti at least once a year for about 3 weeks to better our project and work in collaboration with local physicians to establish continuity of care.<br/>In the communities where we work, we always find people who have never been to doctors, not because they do not want to, but because they can't afford the costs associated with it. A good portion of the people we have seen unknowingly have severe hypertension. Anemia is also very prevalent in adults and children. Easily treatable infections such as urinary tract infections, vaginal candidiasis or pneumonia are major problems because they are not properly treated or not treated at all. Usually people self-medicate on antibiotics (which are usually expired or have been sitting in the sun) that are easily available on the streets without need for prescriptions. Because of limited access to the healthcare, a good portion of the population has a short life expectancy. We believe that educating a community about important aspects of their health and providing them with the tools to implement successful changes, will not only improve the health of the community, but ultimately contribute to the prosperity of the nation as a whole.<br/></font></span></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
My name is Jonathan Philippe. I am the founder of Sante Haiti. As someone who grew up in Haiti, I experienced first-hand what it means to not have access to basic health care. Thank goodness, I never had any major illness. However, this is not the case for a good portion of the population. Knowing that fact has put a strong desire in my heart to go back to Haiti and help as best as I can. Since starting medical school, I have been going to Haiti with friends at least once a year to provide basic healthcare in the community where I grew up, Martissant, a suburb of Port-au-Prince. 
 
Sante Pou Tout Moun ""Health Care for All"" is the very essence of Sante Haiti. It is the guiding principle of our work. We see health as a human right that should be enjoyed by all and it is our mission to do all we can to ensure that the men, women and children of Haiti are able to enjoy this right. We provide sante pou tout moun through service, partnership, education and empowerment.Our vision is to lessen existing healthcare inequalities by improving access to essential medical services within communities. We aim to highlight the importance of primary prevention through promoting healthy lifestyles and supporting community members in reaching and maintaining their health-related goals.We are committed to working in partnership with members of the community and with supporting agencies to reach these objectives.
It is our belief that education leads to empowerment and as public health physicians we are strongly dedicated to teaching. We lead several community talks on public health issues and have seen, first hand, the value of teaching/training in empowering individuals and communities. A major component of our work also involves training health workers, nurses in particular, for the continuity of care.

The Impact
The program was initiated in the summer of 2008 where in less than 3 days, over 400 patients were seen for blood pressure checks, distribution of vitamins and education on public health issues in Martissant. The following year, over 1,000 patients were seen in Martissant, Delmas, Aux Cayes, Cap Haitien by our group. We have nurses that follow-up with those patients bi-weekly. The people we see are always looking forward to our return to Haiti.  They constantly ask us to come more often so they can get a chance to see a healthcare professional more than once a year without having to worry about cost. In this spirit, we are planning on continuing and expanding the project, traveling to Haiti at least once a year for about 3 weeks to better our project and work in collaboration with local physicians to establish continuity of care.In the communities where we work, we always find people who have never been to doctors, not because they do not want to, but because they can't afford the costs associated with it. A good portion of the people we have seen unknowingly have severe hypertension. Anemia is also very prevalent in adults and children. Easily treatable infections such as urinary tract infections, vaginal candidiasis or pneumonia are major problems because they are not properly treated or not treated at all. Usually people self-medicate on antibiotics (which are usually expired or have been sitting in the sun) that are easily available on the streets without need for prescriptions. Because of limited access to the healthcare, a good portion of the population has a short life expectancy. We believe that educating a community about important aspects of their health and providing them with the tools to implement successful changes, will not only improve the health of the community, but ultimately contribute to the prosperity of the nation as a whole.
 

What We Need 
We will be heading to Haiti in May 2012. Our goal is to raise $15, 000 to provide medicines, supplies, sponsor local health workers and sponsor continued care for severely ill patients.   
 
Medicines
Since high blood pressure and anemia are the most prevalent conditions that we have seen so far, we are planning on bringing blood pressure medications, iron tablets, folate, and other vitamins. Ibuprofen and antibiotics will also be very valuable to the community. We estimate that we will need about $5000 to cover those expenses.
 
Supplies
We need various supplies for screenings and follow-up checks such as glucometers and test strips, blood pressure cuffs, cholesterol meters and test strips, gloves, alcohol swabs, lancets, neosporin, bandages, etc. We estimate we will need about $3000 to cover those expenses.
 
Stipends for community workers
We have many people who live in Haiti that will help us with translation, registration on the clinic days, doing the vitals and other supporting work. We plan to give those helpers about $3000 total for their assistance.
 
Miscellaneous
While all the healthcare professionals who will be going to Haiti with us will be volunteering their time and paying their own airfare, certain expenses associated with the trip will be covered by the money raised. Expenses  associated with the transportation of supplies (customs etc.), printing brochures and other educational material,  transportation to and from locations within Haiti to provide care and food throughout our trip. We estimate for 5 volunteers for 3 weeks, we will need about $1000 for those expenses.  
 
Community Health Fund
In 2012 we will be launching our Community Health Fund. Medical fees, though only less than $40 per patient, are a major barrier to care for many Haitians. We are aiming to combat this by creating a fund to meet the medical costs of those in need of continued care.The money will be used to sponsor clinic visits, medicine costs and hospital stays of patients in need of continued care. From the money raised, $3000 will be put into the Community Health Fund. We plan to continue raising money, particularly for the fund in the future. 
Your contribution would be a big help in ensuring a sick individual gets the care s/he needs.

You see, my mother<br/>in law (Cloudkicker and Whoof’s mother) has <strong>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</strong> (or <strong>COPD</strong>), it is a type of lung disease that causes scarring and other damage to the lungs and makes it <em>extremely</em> hard to breathe.

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>We are a group of Rwandans who are in US colleges under the name ""Rwandans4Water' trying to help our people in Rwanda have access to clean drinking water. Our motto is 'Bringing Water Home' and we are proud to be a solution we once struggled with. We have 2 full-time volunteers who returned home after they graduated from Oklahoma Christian School of Engineering. They are coordinating all activities.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What we are doing</h3>
<p>in Partnership with water4 Foundation, we are developing an affordable and sustainable technology that is helping people in rural areas get clean water. they technology consist of different metal tools that manually drill a water-well without the usage of sophisticated and expensive machinery. Shipping all the materials is expensive and that is the reason why we are trying to locally manufacture the materials. An amount of  $15,000 is enough to set up a small manufacturing shop that will heavily contribute in designing drilling equippments, thus increasing our impact in rural communities.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>In partnership with local administration and Rwanda ministry of infrascture, we have from 2010 completed 9 water wells in the Eastern Province of Rwanda, Gatsibo District. Up to 5,000 people now have access to fresh water. With the materials being manufactured in Rwanda and distributed to teams of trained locals we are expecting to provide water to 20,000 people within the next 2 years. Join us and help people have this very basic need in life: WATER!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How to help</h3>
<p>Donate and help us reach $15,000 in the next 2 months. Get the word out to your family, friends, coworkers, etc. Introduce us to people or organizations you know they can help. A full detailed report will be emailed regularly to our donors as the shop gets put in place. We also send a monthly newsletter of our activities in Rwanda.</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Imagine your world without the hassle of passwords...<br/>Never forgetting a password again...<br/></em><em>Knowing you digital identities are finally safe...</em></p>
<p><span>Hi. We’re MagicKey, perfect password mangement. We are Gyle Iverson and Tim Cope and we love creating new solutions to old problems. For 25 years we have written software to solve problems in many areas, including password management for governments, schools and large organizations. We have developed the world’s only smartphone based password management app. It works like magic, learning, creating, entering, maintaining, and changing your passwords on the one device you aways have with you – your smartphone. Our project is to complete the Beta version that we have developed so far and release this amazing app to the world by March 2013. MagicKey can provide unprecedented security at everyone’s fingertips. But we need your help.</span></p>
<p><span>We need to raise $250,000 to cover the cost of development and testing this amazing app or it may never make it out of our lab. So we're turning to our strongest supporters to ask for contributions. In exchange, we're offering you lifetime subscriptions and the opportunity to be memorialized in the app itself. Your contribution will help us get the product into everyone’s hands, and further, it will help make our digital world a safer place for everyone. Thanks!</span></p>
<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p>Thanks for visiting our MagicKey project today. Again, we are Gyle Iverson and Tim Cope. We are passionate about creating new solutions for old problems. While colleagues at various companies, we have collaborated in the development of; software development tools, post-relational database engines, big data indexing, and most recently, security automation products.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Security automation does not sound sexy does it? </em></p>
<p>Basically, what we developed were products to help companies follow recommended security best practices. Organizations using our products were able to keep their computers secure without needing a small army of people. Sounds simple right?</p>
<p>Well, automation that makes it look simple is complicated on the inside. And it is developing that balance between apparent simplicity and underlying complexity that we enjoy.</p>
<p>Our history is helping make people’s lives easier though automation, so we looked at a variety of personal productivity areas. The one area we quickly focused on is password management.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Again, we know, this is not sexy, right? <br/> Please keep reading. You will like the ending. We promise.</em></p>
<p>At our previous employer we worked together developing password management automation for government, schools and large institutions. Password management at that level is different from what you need or want in your life. However, much of what we learned and developed there is applicable for the everyday hassles people have with passwords.</p>
<p>Love 'em or hate 'em, managing passwords takes practice and discipline to achieve and maintain their goal; your security. Unfortunately, most people use their same password everywhere and are surprised when something regrettable happens like their accounts get hacked. The majority of people we talk with say they don’t want to bother with using passwords correctly; the vast majority.</p>
<h2><strong>Why We Care</strong></h2>
<p>We watched our friends, family, and co-workers struggle with managing their passwords. Heck, we even struggled and we worked in the password management field.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Ironic, right? </em></p>
<p>We researched the dozens of password managers on Google Play and the Apple App Store. We found a variety of password manager apps. Unfortunately there is no standard describing what a password manager should do. So many of the apps simply let you enter and read your passwords on your smartphone. No automation there. Boring! However, a few apps do offer some degree of automation so we dug into those products to understand their technologies and fundamental design to see if there was room for improvement.</p>
<p>After a closer inspection we found the products providing automation are really PC or Mac products that later added a smartphone version. It appears that so far, these smartphone versions provide limited or no automation at all; instead, the automation resides on a PC or Mac. That seemed odd to us given that today’s smartphone are powerful computers. Then we found the really weird thing. All of the products will copy your user names and passwords to all of the computers and devices you use.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Hold on! Wait a minute! </em></p>
<p>Putting copies of your secrets on computers and devices which may not be under your control is unsafe! Why is that unsafe? If someone else can control your computer, it is no longer <em>your</em> computer. Therefore your information may become their information. Your home computer could be a great example. Perhaps your significant other, child, or a guest uses your home computer when you are not around. Do you really want to leave your secrets there?</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Gyle’s kids are malware magnets and his home computer frequently gets this or that little </em>surprise<em>. Even with <em>anti-virus </em>installed, active, and up to date.</em></p>
<p>And here’s the deal with what you call <em>your</em> work computer. It is really your <em>employer’s</em> computer and they control it. Their IT people can get in to it and do what they want, whether you are around or not. Again, not a place you want to leave <em>your</em> secrets.</p>
<p>And we also found numerous complaints in product support forums about synchronization problems after passwords are changed. Some products require you to synchronize manually, which takes effort, while other products try to automate synchronization, but network connectivity problems can leave some computers or devices with out of date passwords, leading to manual password resets. This does not sound like quality automation to us.</p>
<p>So we developed a <em>real</em> smartphone password manager app called MagicKey that:</p>

<p>We want the digital world to be a safer place for you and everyone else. The MagicKey approach is safer than the other products available. And with your help, we will get MagicKey out to everyone.</p>
<p>Your contribution help gets us to our goal of $250,000 and enables us to hire additional people to complete the project by March of 2013; just a few months from now.</p>
<p>We started designing and developing MagicKey in the Spring of 2011 and have a beta version now. People pledging their support that are comfortable working with pre-release software and the occasional problems that may arise are welcome to request a download code. Otherwise, the formal release of MagicKey for Android currently estimated for March 2013.</p>
<p>What’s left to do? Quite a bit. We want to hire some employees and contractors to quickly get MagicKey for Android out for people to use. To do that by March 2013 we need at least $250,000 and here is how we plan to spend that money.</p>
<ul>
<li>We want MagicKey to automatically change your passwords for you on a schedule. Relieving you from the tedious task that you seldom perform anyway, unless you happened to forget your password. Considering there are over 675 million web sites on the Internet today and growing, imagine being content, knowing you are continuously protected from hackers trying to get your passwords from weakly protected web sites. We will spend <strong>$35,000</strong> to develop the programming to change a password automatically.</li>
<li>We want to add the ability to share user names and passwords with friends, family and collegues. There are many web sites where you only get a single user name and password to access your account information. Trying to routinely change passwords that are shared between multiple people can be a nightmare. The more widely a password is shared, the more frequently it should be changed. The MagicKey sharing modes allow changing shared passwords without the typical synchronization drama found elsewhere. We will spend <strong>$40,000</strong> to finish development of the sharing modes. </li>
<li>To activate, upgrade, and issue rewards, we need to develop a web service on the Google App Engine. We have the design and will spend <strong>$30,000</strong> to develop this service.</li>
<li>We want MagicKey to support additional browsers, such as, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox on Microsoft Windows. Plus, we need to provide our own MagicKey enabled web browser on Google Android. For that we need a small web browser team. We will spend <strong>$20,000</strong> on developing the web browser and add-ons.</li>
<li>We want MagicKey to work on Apple OS X so the MagicKey communication components need to be ported.  We will spend <strong>$25,000</strong> for porting the communication components.</li>
<li>After porting the MagicKey communication components to Apple OS X, we then want MagicKey to support Apple Safari, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox on Apple OS X. We will spend <strong>$20,000</strong> on these web browser add-ons.</li>
<li>We want MagicKey users to have the confidence to set MagicKey to accept automatic updates. To ensure MagicKey’s quality is maintained and improves as we introduce more features, we must create a robust test suite. We will setup two different test teams. One team is dedicated to the Google Android and the other team is dedicated to the Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X components. We will spend <strong>$55,000</strong> to develop test suites.</li>
</ul><p>A lot people we meet are asking us to make an Apple iPhone version of MagicKey also. We would <em>love</em> to do that. The funding goal we set for this project lets us complete the MagicKey for Android version and make it available to the world. Every thing over our goal gets us closer to making the MagicKey for iPhone a reality too.</p>
<h2><strong>The MagicKey Swag</strong></h2>
<p>We have a few swag for you to consider. You can support our campaign by purchasing just the swag or include some swag along with a higher commitment that includes a life-time subscription to MagicKey. Because our swag are made specifically for you, we can print your participation level below the MagicKey logo on all these items. This option is available for the Supporter, <span>Founder, Benefactor, Associate Producer, Producer, Executive Producer, and Key Maker</span> contributions.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cloudvaults.com/images/swag_1.0.png"" src="""" style=""""/>Our unique MagicKey mouse pads are available for $10 with domestic shipping included. For international shipping, please add $15.</p>
<p>We also have high-quality 100% cotton t-shirts in standard or fitted style in all popular sizes that are unique for this project. The price to you for our t-shirts is $25 with domestic shipping included. For international shipping, please add $15.</p>
<h2><strong>What Happens If We Don’t Meet the Funding Goal?</strong></h2>
<p>Because this is a flexible funding project, if we fail to reach the funding goal in time, the delivery date for the MagicKey for Android formal release will be pushed out later in 2013. Should this happen, shortly after the project close date arrives, we will provide everyone with a revised projected delivery date.</p>
<h2><strong>Why This Matters to Everyone</strong></h2>
<p>You probably hear or read about how hackers routinely break into web sites and steal user names and passwords. And it is scary to imagine this happens more than we hear about because some web sites may not detect the break-in occurred. And worse, maybe there isn’t a break-in at all, and instead, a web site insider with necessary access steals the information and sells it. The best defense against these events affecting you is to have unique complex passwords you change frequently.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Yeah, right. Like that’s going to happen by itself. I mean, really! </em></p>
<p>What you and everyone else needs is MagicKey. MagicKey lets you take proper password management off your to-do list. Delegate the mundane, time consuming, error-prone task to MagicKey. Just remember your master password and then rest assured MagicKey is keeping the passwords for your digital life safe and secure.</p>
<p>We have made phenomenal strides and now need your help to push MagicKey over the finish line and get it out for the world to use.</p>
<h2><strong>All the Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>

<p> </p></div>","Quick Intro
Imagine your world without the hassle of passwords...Never forgetting a password again...Knowing you digital identities are finally safe...
Hi. We’re MagicKey, perfect password mangement. We are Gyle Iverson and Tim Cope and we love creating new solutions to old problems. For 25 years we have written software to solve problems in many areas, including password management for governments, schools and large organizations. We have developed the world’s only smartphone based password management app. It works like magic, learning, creating, entering, maintaining, and changing your passwords on the one device you aways have with you – your smartphone. Our project is to complete the Beta version that we have developed so far and release this amazing app to the world by March 2013. MagicKey can provide unprecedented security at everyone’s fingertips. But we need your help.
We need to raise $250,000 to cover the cost of development and testing this amazing app or it may never make it out of our lab. So we're turning to our strongest supporters to ask for contributions. In exchange, we're offering you lifetime subscriptions and the opportunity to be memorialized in the app itself. Your contribution will help us get the product into everyone’s hands, and further, it will help make our digital world a safer place for everyone. Thanks!
Background
Thanks for visiting our MagicKey project today. Again, we are Gyle Iverson and Tim Cope. We are passionate about creating new solutions for old problems. While colleagues at various companies, we have collaborated in the development of; software development tools, post-relational database engines, big data indexing, and most recently, security automation products.
Security automation does not sound sexy does it? 
Basically, what we developed were products to help companies follow recommended security best practices. Organizations using our products were able to keep their computers secure without needing a small army of people. Sounds simple right?
Well, automation that makes it look simple is complicated on the inside. And it is developing that balance between apparent simplicity and underlying complexity that we enjoy.
Our history is helping make people’s lives easier though automation, so we looked at a variety of personal productivity areas. The one area we quickly focused on is password management.
Again, we know, this is not sexy, right?  Please keep reading. You will like the ending. We promise.
At our previous employer we worked together developing password management automation for government, schools and large institutions. Password management at that level is different from what you need or want in your life. However, much of what we learned and developed there is applicable for the everyday hassles people have with passwords.
Love 'em or hate 'em, managing passwords takes practice and discipline to achieve and maintain their goal; your security. Unfortunately, most people use their same password everywhere and are surprised when something regrettable happens like their accounts get hacked. The majority of people we talk with say they don’t want to bother with using passwords correctly; the vast majority.
Why We Care
We watched our friends, family, and co-workers struggle with managing their passwords. Heck, we even struggled and we worked in the password management field.
Ironic, right? 
We researched the dozens of password managers on Google Play and the Apple App Store. We found a variety of password manager apps. Unfortunately there is no standard describing what a password manager should do. So many of the apps simply let you enter and read your passwords on your smartphone. No automation there. Boring! However, a few apps do offer some degree of automation so we dug into those products to understand their technologies and fundamental design to see if there was room for improvement.
After a closer inspection we found the products providing automation are really PC or Mac products that later added a smartphone version. It appears that so far, these smartphone versions provide limited or no automation at all; instead, the automation resides on a PC or Mac. That seemed odd to us given that today’s smartphone are powerful computers. Then we found the really weird thing. All of the products will copy your user names and passwords to all of the computers and devices you use.
Hold on! Wait a minute! 
Putting copies of your secrets on computers and devices which may not be under your control is unsafe! Why is that unsafe? If someone else can control your computer, it is no longer your computer. Therefore your information may become their information. Your home computer could be a great example. Perhaps your significant other, child, or a guest uses your home computer when you are not around. Do you really want to leave your secrets there?
Gyle’s kids are malware magnets and his home computer frequently gets this or that little surprise. Even with anti-virus installed, active, and up to date.
And here’s the deal with what you call your work computer. It is really your employer’s computer and they control it. Their IT people can get in to it and do what they want, whether you are around or not. Again, not a place you want to leave your secrets.
And we also found numerous complaints in product support forums about synchronization problems after passwords are changed. Some products require you to synchronize manually, which takes effort, while other products try to automate synchronization, but network connectivity problems can leave some computers or devices with out of date passwords, leading to manual password resets. This does not sound like quality automation to us.
So we developed a real smartphone password manager app called MagicKey that:


Connects your smartphone to your PC via USB, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi

Automatically learns your existing user names and passwords

Securely stores all of your passwords on your smartphone

Automatically types in your user name and password the next time you visit a site
Keeps your information secure with a single master password
Automatically backs up your secret information
Protects your secrets if your smartphone is lost or stolen

Protects you from forgetting your master password with SpareKeys

Provides a Freemium version for occasional users
Allows secure sharing of user names and passwords with your friends, family and colleagues
Automatically changes your passwords periodically for maximum protection, including the passwords you share
Our beta version of MagicKey for Android currently includes items 1 through 8 now. Our project completes the last few items and we are looking to you for assistance.
What This Means to Us
We want the digital world to be a safer place for you and everyone else. The MagicKey approach is safer than the other products available. And with your help, we will get MagicKey out to everyone.
Your contribution help gets us to our goal of $250,000 and enables us to hire additional people to complete the project by March of 2013; just a few months from now.

<p><strong>My Healthy Valentine: The At Heart® Emergency Aspirin Dispenser<br/></strong></p>
Tired of giving chocolate or just a card for Valentine’s Day? How about giving a gift that could save a life? February is Heart Month, and what better way to celebrate than to give a potentially lifesaving product to someone you love. We'll help you do this if you help us raise money for new production tooling.<br/><p><strong>EVERY 63 SECONDS SOMEONE IN THE U.S. DIES FROM A HEART ATTACK </strong></p>
<p>When suffering a heart attack, seconds count. That’s why at the first onset of heart attack symptoms, the American Heart Association recommends calling 911 and chewing an aspirin tablet. When that aspirin tablet is readily available via the At Heart® emergency aspirin dispenser, a life could be saved.</p>
<p>Most heart attacks occur when someone is away from home, and most heart attack deaths occur before the patient gets to the hospital.  At Heart® was invented to enable you to protect yourself by carrying two aspirin tablets with you at all times in a securely protected dispenser.</p>
<p>A lot of people ordered the At Heart® emergency aspirin dispenser at Christmas as a stocking stuffer for someone who is potentially at risk of a cardiac event. Now you can send one with a personalized Valentine’s Day message!</p>
<p><strong>SO WHY DO WE NEED TO RAISE MONEY?</strong></p>
<p>We are not serving the market we need to reach since we are an “internet only” business. In general, the older demographic does not buy products on the internet, and these are the people who have the greatest need for our product. Our phones ring constantly with requests to “tell me what store carries At Heart®” and we have to tell people the answer is none.</p>
<p>Even with the great publicity we received from Rosie O’Donnell's appearance on The Dr. Oz Show, we are still relatively unknown. We need to get At Heart® back in retail distribution across the country, and we need to help spread the word on the benefits this product can offer.</p>
<p><strong>HOW CAN YOU HELP?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">We want to get At Heart® back in retail distribution so it is within reach of everyone who is at risk of having a heart attack.</span> This will save lives. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the United States. But we are a small company and we lack the funding for a full scale marketing effort. We want to make At Heart® available at retail locations across America, but the cost of a national rollout has prevented us from doing this. More on the funding issues later.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">We need evangelists who believe in At Heart® and our mission to save lives to help us spread the word</span>. We are investing in the future of At Heart® by spending money to market the product and develop retail sales opportunities, but we need some help in getting the word out to people at risk. Each year, over 1 million Americans will suffer a first or recurrent heart attack, and half of them will not survive it. Despite these numbers, most people don’t know if they are at risk for a heart attack, and only about 1 in 4 Americans know the warning signs or what to do if a heart attack is suspected. Even if you do not participate in this project, please forward it to your friends and associates. We need all the help we can get!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><br/></strong>By investing in us, you will help us achieve our goal of expanding At Heart® distribution. The Valentine's Day gift will help spread the word on At Heart®. Who knows, we might even help save some lives! </p>
<p><strong>OUR FUNDING CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>We’ve already invested in a redesign of the dispenser to make it easier to open for our elderly consumers. We’ve also simplified the packaging to provide two dispensers instead of a single unit sale (almost all customers buy at least two dispensers). This provides the retailer additional margin to make them more willing to feature and display the item. We've covered the costs for artwork and are ready to buy components. What is stopping us is the need to buy new production tooling, a $3905 expense. That is our fundraising goal. With those funds we can get our retail re-launch back on track!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are running a 120 mile Ragnar relay race through the Appalachian Montains in West Virginia <a href=""http://ragnartrailrelay.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ragnartrailrelay.com/.</a>  The team we have formed, dubbed Free Radicals, is an eclectic bunch (individually introduced below). To the Free Radicals, the Ragnar Relay symbolizes the relay of ideas and information on how to promote sustainability, support local organic agriculture, and encourage wellness through outdoor recreation. These concepts, outside of our friendship and running companionship, bond our team. We are heading to Ragnar to experience a large, well established trail race. Our intention is to bring the energy and enthusiasm of Ragnar back to the Gainesville area. One of our goals is to create similar outdoor recreation experiences in the North Central Florida community.  This campaign, and our run, are to support Eco Agro Trails, a Gainesville-born aspiring non-profit organization.  A prominent focus of EA Trails is to organize outdoor recreation events, specifically trail runs, which support conservation and small agricultural spaces, foster community participation, and encourage personal wellness.  Eco Agro Trails will be holding its first 5k and half marathon trail run on April 6, 2013.  </p>
<p><span>Eco Agro Trails proudly announces its inaugural 1 Mile Eco Agro Guided Farm Tour, Trail Run 5k, and Trail Run Half Marathon to be hosted at Crones' Cradle Conserve. Crones' Cradle Conserve is an ecological preserve, retreat center, and organic farm <a href=""http://cronescradleconserve.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://cronescradleconserve.com/</a>. All proceeds from the race will benefit a local water conservation effort in Marion County and surrounding areas.</span> </p>
<p>Who we are and why we run:</p>
<p><strong>Dylan Lennon </strong>~ I am often asked why I run. For the past three years, the answer to this question has changed many times. After the pain flows from my body, I start to notice things I didn’t notice before. Running makes my senses ripe. The shade sings. The wind yields to my body and bends behind me. And I can see through the branches of the trees, and the clouds resting above. I notice a patch of sky, serene and sure. I carry it with me as I run. I call it my own.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Montilla</strong> ~ Running is the one thing that came naturally to me.  I definitely get hot and tired, sometimes it hurts, and I am tragically slow, but on the trail I feel as agile and fast as a pony - completely charged by the landscape.  Above all, running connects me to wilderness and wilderness connects me to myself. </p>

We are running a 120 mile Ragnar relay race through the Appalachian Montains in West Virginia http://ragnartrailrelay.com/.  The team we have formed, dubbed Free Radicals, is an eclectic bunch (individually introduced below). To the Free Radicals, the Ragnar Relay symbolizes the relay of ideas and information on how to promote sustainability, support local organic agriculture, and encourage wellness through outdoor recreation. These concepts, outside of our friendship and running companionship, bond our team. We are heading to Ragnar to experience a large, well established trail race. Our intention is to bring the energy and enthusiasm of Ragnar back to the Gainesville area. One of our goals is to create similar outdoor recreation experiences in the North Central Florida community.  This campaign, and our run, are to support Eco Agro Trails, a Gainesville-born aspiring non-profit organization.  A prominent focus of EA Trails is to organize outdoor recreation events, specifically trail runs, which support conservation and small agricultural spaces, foster community participation, and encourage personal wellness.  Eco Agro Trails will be holding its first 5k and half marathon trail run on April 6, 2013.  
Eco Agro Trails proudly announces its inaugural 1 Mile Eco Agro Guided Farm Tour, Trail Run 5k, and Trail Run Half Marathon to be hosted at Crones' Cradle Conserve. Crones' Cradle Conserve is an ecological preserve, retreat center, and organic farm http://cronescradleconserve.com/. All proceeds from the race will benefit a local water conservation effort in Marion County and surrounding areas. 
Who we are and why we run:
Dylan Lennon ~ I am often asked why I run. For the past three years, the answer to this question has changed many times. After the pain flows from my body, I start to notice things I didn’t notice before. Running makes my senses ripe. The shade sings. The wind yields to my body and bends behind me. And I can see through the branches of the trees, and the clouds resting above. I notice a patch of sky, serene and sure. I carry it with me as I run. I call it my own.
I am thrilled to participate in Ragnar. Especially because I’ve realized that everyone has their own piece of sky. Our pieces of sky have apparently drifted together, and together we will flight our patches of sky into the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains to see what Summer has in store.
Ori Baber ~ Of the numerous possible personal identifiers, ‘outdoor enthusiast’ and ‘life-long student’, just seem to jibe for me. Running is an essential element of both. Simply: running gets me outside and provides the time and mental space to ponder, ruminate, and assimilate life experiences.  I look forward to the beautiful trails of Ragnar WV.

I will run 18 miles over the 24 hours of the Ragnar Relay, a hefty goal which will feel amazing to accomplish.
Melissa Montilla ~ Running is the one thing that came naturally to me.  I definitely get hot and tired, sometimes it hurts, and I am tragically slow, but on the trail I feel as agile and fast as a pony - completely charged by the landscape.  Above all, running connects me to wilderness and wilderness connects me to myself. 
 The Ragnar Trail Relay will be a magnificent challenge for me.  Raising funds and awareness for our local EcoAgro trail running series will be magnificent for our community!

This is my passion and this is my life. With your help we can make this product a part of the sleeper sofa history. I am raising funds so we can launch the TV marketing campaign.</strong></h2>
<h2>Introducing the new line of automated furniture that offers comfort, style and convenience. ModaDivan presents the New Revolutionary Electric Memory Foam Sleeper Sofa.</h2>
<h2><strong><em>THE PRODUCT</em></strong></h2>
<p><img alt=""ModaDiavn Comes with a remote control - Works up to an amazing 100ft"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/722833/pictures/full/20130325111040-10029_1249764602366_1176993428_789227_6146638_n.jpg?1364235051"" src="""" style="""" title=""ModaDiavn Comes with a remote control - Works up to an amazing 100ft""/></p>
<p>ModaDivan  combines  21st century luxury and efficiency in creating the world’s first, motorized, memory foam sleeper sofa.  This revolutionary sleeper sofa is bound to replace the standard pull-out sofa bed and all of the problems and discomfort that accompany it.  ModaDivan’s unique mechanism allows you to convert this memory foam sofa into a memory foam bed within fifteen seconds at the touch of a button which activates two 300 lb. motors strategically located on each side of the sofa. These motors have been used in hospital beds for decades and have a life expectancy of ten plus years. The motors are safe, dependable and replaceable. This unique concept in furniture is designed for the everyday consumer as well as the residential, hospitality, cruise ship and RV industries.</p>

<h3>(Showing off the Zero Degree Wall Clearance)</h3>
<p>With a zero degree wall clearance, the sofa can be placed flat against a wall and converted into a bed without having to move any furniture.  No more rearranging your room in order to use a pull-out sofa bed. To top things off, you may choose to operate the sofa bed by remote control or by the electric switch while actually sitting or lying on the sofa. And, of course, it is the perfect system for small areas where a pull-out bed would be impossible.</p>

<h3>People pay thousands of dollars for memory foam beds alone. Never before could you have a memory foam bed and sofa, all in one, with this fast electric conversion and space saving capacity.

<h2><strong><em>THE REASON</em></strong></h2>
<p>In order to make this product a success in the residential marketplace, we need to advertise to the masses thru TV commercials. After the viewing they may want to see one in person to be able to sit on it, touch it, and to see it in action. That is what this fundraiser is all about; to raise money and to start TV commercials. My objective is then to place them in retail outlets in every major city. We are going to follow the marketing strategy similar to Tempur-pedic, which is a household name brand. With your contributions we can make all of this possible and make available the ModaDiavn electric sleeper sofa for the residential market.</p>

<p class=""style3""><strong>Gives hotels, resorts and timeshares an edge over their competition.<br/></strong>ModaDivan’s new revolutionary sleeper sofa is your answer and solution! Say good-bye to those extra cots for guests; say good-bye to guest room sofas that are uncomfortable, a waste of space, and/or involve the usual disadvantages of the old-fashioned pull-out sleeper sofa. The innovative ModaDivan is the answer to a more efficient, desirable room layout, as well as a more comfortable experience for your guests.</p>
<p class=""style3"">Whether you want 1 or 1000 units, we can meet your specified needs and requirements. With fifty years of manufacturing experience, exceptional craftsmanship and quick turn-around times, we can work on any project, small or large, to meet your budget and delivery times. All products are 100% customizable in design from C.O.M (Customer’s Own Material): Leather, Fabric, and Ultrasuede upholstery.</p>
<h2 class=""style3"">Transitions in 15 Seconds</h2>
<p>ModaDivan’s unique mechanism system allows you to convert your sofa into a bed within fifteen seconds at the touch of a button. You can even sit or lie on the ModaDivan safely while the transition is occurring. Some people have claimed to use it to softly stretch their backs when reclining from a sitting position. With a zero-degree wall clearance, you can have the ModaDivan right up against the wall. You don’t have to move any coffee tables or even get up to convert your sofa into a bed.  Many people pay thousands of dollars for a memory foam bed; some pay thousands for an uncomfortable sleeper sofa. Never before could you have a comfortable, memory foam sofa and bed all in one.</p>
<h2><strong>From PROTOTYPE to FINISHED PRODUCT to PATENT<br/></strong></h2>
<p>ModaDivan electric sleeper sofa has recently moved to a new manufacture with more production capabilities. We are manufacturing right outside of Orange County, CA. The R&amp;D and prototyping was completed 18 months ago. I received the Patent on this 9 months ago. We are NOW ready to launch TV commercials for marketing campaigns to reach the masses and start placing the ModaDivan where it can be utilized.</p>

</h3>
<h2><strong><em>THE SOLUTION</em></strong></h2>
<p>ModaDivan is the perfect solution for the residential customer’s living comfort and convenience. Not only is this product both a memory foam sofa and bed for a reasonable price, but the “zero degree” wall clearance is invaluable. No more moving coffee tables and wrestling with the heavy metal frames of traditional pull-out sofa beds. What could be more convenient than switching from sofa to bed in fifteen seconds by remote control or by the electric switch while you are already sitting or lying on the sofa?</p>
<p>Durability is a major plus of the ModaDivan. It's patented conversion mechanism is powered by time-tested actuators capable of 1200 pounds of movement. These motors are very quiet, safe and reliable with a useful life of over ten years. Similar technology has been used to lift and lower hospital beds for decades.</p>
<h3>It’s modern styling, competitive pricing, electric powered conversion mechanism and variety of possible leg, arm and color configurations, makes ModaDivan the sleeper sofa that the residential industry has been waiting for.</h3>

<h2><em>Different Applications for the ModaDivan</em></h2>
<p>Now not only is this useful in people’s homes, the ModaDivan can be used in a variety of different applications. One of the main reasons I created this was for the hospitality industry. The timeshare guests main complaint is usually how uncomfortable the sleeper sofas are and that the metal bar is in their backs. I would like to see the hospitality industry, the RV's, cruise liners, trains, private planes  and homes implement the ModaDivan into their everyday living. Also it is my dream that the ModaDivan becomes a name brand in the furniture industry and welcomed by all.</p>

<h3>To Sum it all up</h3>
<p>ModaDivan is a completed and patented product that is ready to hit the masses through TV commercials. With the contributions that we raise we will be able to start the marketing campaign. The first commercials will be run on HGTV.</p>
<p>The second focus will be to put ModaDivans in as many retail outlets as possible throughout all the major cities. I have had so many requests from people all over the U.S. about where they can experience it first hand.</p>
<p>The third focus will be the hospitality industry for hotels and resorts. It has already been shown at four hospitality trade shows. We have generated much interest in this industry. Our next step is to provide samples for guests at hotels and resorts to experience it for themselves. We are still in talks with Disney as they are reviewing a few other sleeper sofas.

<p>ModaDivan</p></div>","Hi, my name is Kevin.  I am the inventor of the ModaDivan Electric Memory Foam Sleeper Sofa. This is my passion and this is my life. With your help we can make this product a part of the sleeper sofa history. I am raising funds so we can launch the TV marketing campaign.
Introducing the new line of automated furniture that offers comfort, style and convenience. ModaDivan presents the New Revolutionary Electric Memory Foam Sleeper Sofa.
THE PRODUCT

ModaDivan  combines  21st century luxury and efficiency in creating the world’s first, motorized, memory foam sleeper sofa.  This revolutionary sleeper sofa is bound to replace the standard pull-out sofa bed and all of the problems and discomfort that accompany it.  ModaDivan’s unique mechanism allows you to convert this memory foam sofa into a memory foam bed within fifteen seconds at the touch of a button which activates two 300 lb. motors strategically located on each side of the sofa. These motors have been used in hospital beds for decades and have a life expectancy of ten plus years. The motors are safe, dependable and replaceable. This unique concept in furniture is designed for the everyday consumer as well as the residential, hospitality, cruise ship and RV industries.

(Showing off the Zero Degree Wall Clearance)
With a zero degree wall clearance, the sofa can be placed flat against a wall and converted into a bed without having to move any furniture.  No more rearranging your room in order to use a pull-out sofa bed. To top things off, you may choose to operate the sofa bed by remote control or by the electric switch while actually sitting or lying on the sofa. And, of course, it is the perfect system for small areas where a pull-out bed would be impossible.

People pay thousands of dollars for memory foam beds alone. Never before could you have a memory foam bed and sofa, all in one, with this fast electric conversion and space saving capacity. You can also design your own sofa appearance to meet your style and fashion needs. ModaDivan is your solution for comfort, convenience, and style

 
( A few after photos from the HGTV Room Crasher Show )
THE REASON
In order to make this product a success in the residential marketplace, we need to advertise to the masses thru TV commercials. After the viewing they may want to see one in person to be able to sit on it, touch it, and to see it in action. That is what this fundraiser is all about; to raise money and to start TV commercials. My objective is then to place them in retail outlets in every major city. We are going to follow the marketing strategy similar to Tempur-pedic, which is a household name brand. With your contributions we can make all of this possible and make available the ModaDiavn electric sleeper sofa for the residential market.

Why is ModaDivan unique?








For any application you can think of, ModaDivan will fit all your needs and more! It is equipped with a power operated remote control that reaches an incredible range of 100 feet or more.



 



Also located on the side of the SOFA is a switch device that can be used while sitting or lying on the sofa.  The simple task of using the remote or switch can instantly give you the most comfortable memory foam sleeper sofa you have been waiting for.







 


 




What Is ModaDivan you ask?
MODA means Stylish, Fashionable and Trendy. DIVAN means Couch or Sofa. ModaDivan is the new stylish, fashionable, ultra-comfortable & trendy sofa hitting the furniture market! This is a fully automated electric sleeper sofa. At the touch of a button the sofa quietly and smoothly moves into a comfortable memory foam bed.

 (ModaDivan arrives at Disney Headquarters Orlando, FL)



 ( Meeting with Disney Executives. Great for Hotels and Resorts. So many applications you can use the ModaDivan for)
Gives hotels, resorts and timeshares an edge over their competition.ModaDivan’s new revolutionary sleeper sofa is your answer and solution! Say good-bye to those extra cots for guests; say good-bye to guest room sofas that are uncomfortable, a waste of space, and/or involve the usual disadvantages of the old-fashioned pull-out sleeper sofa. The innovative ModaDivan is the answer to a more efficient, desirable room layout, as well as a more comfortable experience for your guests.
Whether you want 1 or 1000 units, we can meet your specified needs and requirements. With fifty years of manufacturing experience, exceptional craftsmanship and quick turn-around times, we can work on any project, small or large, to meet your budget and delivery times. All products are 100% customizable in design from C.O.M (Customer’s Own Material): Leather, Fabric, and Ultrasuede upholstery.
Transitions in 15 Seconds
ModaDivan’s unique mechanism system allows you to convert your sofa into a bed within fifteen seconds at the touch of a button. You can even sit or lie on the ModaDivan safely while the transition is occurring. Some people have claimed to use it to softly stretch their backs when reclining from a sitting position. With a zero-degree wall clearance, you can have the ModaDivan right up against the wall. You don’t have to move any coffee tables or even get up to convert your sofa into a bed.  Many people pay thousands of dollars for a memory foam bed; some pay thousands for an uncomfortable sleeper sofa. Never before could you have a comfortable, memory foam sofa and bed all in one.
From PROTOTYPE to FINISHED PRODUCT to PATENT
ModaDivan electric sleeper sofa has recently moved to a new manufacture with more production capabilities. We are manufacturing right outside of Orange County, CA. The R&D and prototyping was completed 18 months ago. I received the Patent on this 9 months ago. We are NOW ready to launch TV commercials for marketing campaigns to reach the masses and start placing the ModaDivan where it can be utilized.

 Manufacture Facility

THE SOLUTION
ModaDivan is the perfect solution for the residential customer’s living comfort and convenience. Not only is this product both a memory foam sofa and bed for a reasonable price, but the “zero degree” wall clearance is invaluable. No more moving coffee tables and wrestling with the heavy metal frames of traditional pull-out sofa beds. What could be more convenient than switching from sofa to bed in fifteen seconds by remote control or by the electric switch while you are already sitting or lying on the sofa?
Durability is a major plus of the ModaDivan. It's patented conversion mechanism is powered by time-tested actuators capable of 1200 pounds of movement. These motors are very quiet, safe and reliable with a useful life of over ten years. Similar technology has been used to lift and lower hospital beds for decades.
It’s modern styling, competitive pricing, electric powered conversion mechanism and variety of possible leg, arm and color configurations, makes ModaDivan the sleeper sofa that the residential industry has been waiting for.

 







(Moves only 12 inches into the room- No more moving coffee tables - You don’t even have to get off of the couch to convert it to a bed!!)

Patent received in 2012

Different Applications for the ModaDivan
Now not only is this useful in people’s homes, the ModaDivan can be used in a variety of different applications. One of the main reasons I created this was for the hospitality industry. The timeshare guests main complaint is usually how uncomfortable the sleeper sofas are and that the metal bar is in their backs. I would like to see the hospitality industry, the RV's, cruise liners, trains, private planes  and homes implement the ModaDivan into their everyday living. Also it is my dream that the ModaDivan becomes a name brand in the furniture industry and welcomed by all.

(Residential)

(Hotels)

(Private Jets)

(Yachts and Cruise Ships)
To Sum it all up
ModaDivan is a completed and patented product that is ready to hit the masses through TV commercials. With the contributions that we raise we will be able to start the marketing campaign. The first commercials will be run on HGTV.
The second focus will be to put ModaDivans in as many retail outlets as possible throughout all the major cities. I have had so many requests from people all over the U.S. about where they can experience it first hand.
The third focus will be the hospitality industry for hotels and resorts. It has already been shown at four hospitality trade shows. We have generated much interest in this industry. Our next step is to provide samples for guests at hotels and resorts to experience it for themselves. We are still in talks with Disney as they are reviewing a few other sleeper sofas. So far, they have shown a good interest in the ModaDivan.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>We are holding a benefit for MARCH OF DIMES in Memory of Christina Maria Gilmore and need help funding the event in order to make it happen!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To see the event posting, please follow this link and scroll down to September 29th under ""Calendar of Events""  This is hopefully going to be a terrific fundraiser but we need help!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.countycenter.biz/Events.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.countycenter.biz/Events.htm</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>CMG Fundraising Foundation was founded and named in memory of Christina Maria Gilmore, the daughter of Jennifer and Robert Gilmore, sister to Kaitlyn.  Christina Maria was born on June 11th, 2011 in only the 23rd week of Jennifer's pregnancy at a mere 12 ounces and 11 inches.</p>
<p>On June 26th, 2011, Christina Maria passed away in the arms of her loving mother.</p>
<p>During her very brief life, Christina Maria alone touched the lives of hundreds of people and created a special, untouchable and unbreakable bond between complete strangers.  Christina Maria is the true symbol of hope, unconditional love and inspiration for us all.</p>
<p>Christina Maria’s legacy continues as she again brings individuals and families, complete strangers, businesses, schools, organizations and foundations together throughout the country to learn from each other, create friendships and help raise desperately needed funds for so many through the help, aid, work and dedication of CMG Fundraising Foundation.</p>
<p>The photo that you see on this campaign is Christina Maria Gilmore.  Even though she was born 17 weeks pre-mature, her facial features are fully developed and her body and extremities, though extremely small, are all that of a full-term newborn.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>CMG Fundraising Foundation in collaboration with March of Dimes is proud to announce our first benefit in Christina Maria’s name, honor and memory:</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""><strong>1<sup>st</sup> Annual Christina Maria Gilmore</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Through this benefit and the incredible work of our volunteers and friends at March of Dimes, it is with great ambition and dedication that we honor the million babies worldwide who died this year, including Christina Maria, because they were born too soon, and the 12 million more who struggle to survive and to focus everyone’s attention on the serious problem of premature birth.</p>
<p>“Although providers have made tremendous advances in caring for babies born too small and too soon, we need to find out how to prevent preterm birth from happening in the first place. Despite decades of research, scientists have not yet developed effective ways to help prevent premature birth.”</p>
<p>It is also time that we help spread awareness about the even lesser known medical conditions that effect pregnant women worldwide - Eclampsia and HELLP Syndrome.</p>
<p>Christina Maria could just very well be alive today if her mother Jennifer had only known about Eclampsia and HELLP Syndrome which were the primary medical conditions that led to Christina Maria’s early birth and untimely death.</p>
<p>“HELLP Syndrome can be difficult to diagnose due to the variability of symptoms among patients (frequently patients have no symptoms other than general abdominal pain), and early diagnosis is key in reducing morbidity.  If not treated in a timely manner, a mother can become critically ill or die due to liver rupture/hemorrhage or cerebral edema.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are estimating that the total amount needed to pay for all expenses of this event are $38,000.</p>

of  emotional, social and learning disabilities. Often, kids are 
described as ""at  risk"" if they have a history of emotional or physical 
abuse or neglect. If the  child's parents are substance abusers, the 
children may be assumed to be at risk. The U.S.  Census Bureau studied 
populations of children at risk and identified certain  characteristics 
of this group, such as common personal and familial conditions.	<br/><br/>Kids
 defined to be ""at-risk"" are between the ages of 5 and 17. This age 
group is  school-aged. Children below this age are often too young to 
exhibit the symptoms  of neglect or abuse. Students over the age of 17 
are considered adults.<br/><br/>At-risk children may have been diagnosed 
with a learning disability, such as  Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), 
Attention Deficit Hyper-active Disorder  (ADHD), Asperger's Syndrome, 
Autism or Dyslexia. They may have been retained in  a grade at least 
once. They may not be proficient in English. The presence of  any of 
these conditions does not indicate that a child may be at risk. Rather, 
 these conditions have simply been identified as common among children 
at risk.<br/><br/>Some of the signs or symptoms that at-risk kids exhibit 
are difficulty  concentrating, social or emotional withdrawal, violent 
or anti-social behavior  and trouble communicating. Kids that are 
at-risk because of sexual abuse may  exhibit more particular behaviors. 
For example, young kids that have been  sexually abused often lose 
control of bladder or engage in inappropriate  touching with other 
classmates. However, not all at-risk kids exhibit noticeable  signs or 
symptoms of abuse or neglect, making it difficult to identify and help  
those in need<br/><br/>The intent of this campus is to provide a safe 
peaceful environment where children will stay from two weeks up to three
 months.  They will be provided with daily time with a professional 
Social Worker, Psychologist and other specifically trained individuals. 
 <br/><br/>The pictures found on this site are of a property with 50 
acres, three buildings, The Log House, Offices, and training center, The
 Dormitory and The Classroom Building.  There are plans for a new 
Dormitory facility to be established in 2016.  Initially there will be

PLEASE DON'T JUST VISIT WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL VISITORS TO DATE.  THESE KIDS NEED OUR HELP, THEY NEED YOUR HELP.  PLEASE HELP US HELP THEM TODAY!  THANK YOU FOR COMMITTING TO HELP FINANCIALLY  AND ALSO SPREAD THE WORD.  EVERY MOMENT THAT GOES BY MORE CHILDREN WILL BE PLACED IN MORE SITUATION THAT WILL DETERMINE THE FUTURE OF THEIR LIVES FOR THE BETTER OR THE WORSE WITH OUT YOUR HELP!THANK YOU.Our goal is to provide a private non-governmental campus for At Risk Kids.  A place where loving professionals can provide avenues of relief with the intent and hope of a life-long impact.  Having interviewed and discussed this vision to many individuals involved in this area of expertise we believe that Lothlorien Campus is the place for this to best provide for these plans. The video demonstrates the significant need that children have for a safe place where life changing experiences can happen.  Though the video is made to raise concerns found in Canada, the Board felt that it really was not area specific and demonstrated the need that we are addressing at Lothlorien Campus.  If you have a heart for Children at Risk please join us in this endeavour.  Your gift whether greater or smaller will have a important impact on Children at Risk.  Thank you for your involvement and please spread the word.  Our window is very narrow to capture this moment.  Thank you!______________________________________________________________________At-risk kids are kids that have demonstrated themselves to be ""at risk"" 
of  emotional, social and learning disabilities. Often, kids are 
described as ""at  risk"" if they have a history of emotional or physical 
abuse or neglect. If the  child's parents are substance abusers, the 
children may be assumed to be at risk. The U.S.  Census Bureau studied 
populations of children at risk and identified certain  characteristics 
of this group, such as common personal and familial conditions.	Kids
 defined to be ""at-risk"" are between the ages of 5 and 17. This age 
group is  school-aged. Children below this age are often too young to 
exhibit the symptoms  of neglect or abuse. Students over the age of 17 
are considered adults.At-risk children may have been diagnosed 
with a learning disability, such as  Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), 
Attention Deficit Hyper-active Disorder  (ADHD), Asperger's Syndrome, 
Autism or Dyslexia. They may have been retained in  a grade at least 
once. They may not be proficient in English. The presence of  any of 
these conditions does not indicate that a child may be at risk. Rather, 
 these conditions have simply been identified as common among children 
at risk.Some of the signs or symptoms that at-risk kids exhibit 
are difficulty  concentrating, social or emotional withdrawal, violent 
or anti-social behavior  and trouble communicating. Kids that are 
at-risk because of sexual abuse may  exhibit more particular behaviors. 
For example, young kids that have been  sexually abused often lose 
control of bladder or engage in inappropriate  touching with other 
classmates. However, not all at-risk kids exhibit noticeable  signs or 
symptoms of abuse or neglect, making it difficult to identify and help  
those in needThe intent of this campus is to provide a safe 
peaceful environment where children will stay from two weeks up to three
 months.  They will be provided with daily time with a professional 
Social Worker, Psychologist and other specifically trained individuals. 
 The pictures found on this site are of a property with 50 
acres, three buildings, The Log House, Offices, and training center, The
 Dormitory and The Classroom Building.  There are plans for a new 
Dormitory facility to be established in 2016.  Initially there will be 
an anticipated attendance of 25-30 children on campus, this is planned 
to grow to 125 by 2016.  A 25 acre portion of the property will be sold 
to a developer providing additional funds to be used toward the

A category once synonymous with innovation and technological advancement has been replaced with minor yearly “upgrades,” uninspired design, and a lack of uniqueness.  Manufacturers these days are dumping money into manufacturing technology to make the phones cheaper and at higher volumes; not into developing revolutionary technology. </span><br/></p><div>
<p>We were tired of being told what the epitome of technology and innovation were by the products offered to us on the shelf, so we sought to test those limits for ourselves and ask, “What do we want in a smartphone, and can we do it?”</p>
<p>The answer to that question was something so unique, versatile, and beautiful, we’ve made it our mission to bring it to life.</p>
<p>WHAT IS PORTAL? </p>
<p>The Portal is a smartphone designed for tech enthusiasts, active individuals, and on-the-go professionals who are frustrated with bulky, cluttered, non-durable phones that constantly get in the way of their dynamic lifestyles. Our goal was to create a device that combines advanced smartphone technology with the convenience and mobility of smart watches and fitness trackers- a handheld phone when you need it, a wearable device when you want it. <b><i>No longer will you need to carry and connect a smartwatch, fitness tracker and smartphone all at once.</i></b>  Portal offers you the best of those devices at the times you choose.</p>

<h1>WHO ARE WE? </h1>
<p>We tech enthusiasts, inventors, and serial entrepreneurs, are passionate about finding solutions rather than waiting for so called established corporations to take care of the issues we customers face.</p>
<p>In the smartphone industry space, innovation is getting limited to making them thinner and lighter with little thought put into making them durable. When we look  at other smart devices such as smart-watches and fitness trackers, we notice that they struggle with limited functionality and stickiness. </p>
<p>We as a team decided to take this problem head on and have created a device that combines advanced smartphone technology with the convenience and mobility of smart watches and fitness trackers- a handheld phone when you need it, a wearable device when you want it. We named it as “Portal”.</p>
<p>Portal is a new unique Android based smartphone that is flexible, water resistant, shatterproof, and wearable. We are lucky to have award winning team members. Adam Eastman, our lead mechanical engineer is UC Berkeley inventor and entrepreneur. Jonathan Quintin is award winning graphic designer who has led design projects for companies such as Bosch, Google, Intel and Mitsubishi Motors. Dan Daogaru, CTO and award winning HW engineer, is himself a successful serial entrepreneur and has been in the wireless space since the analog phone days. </p>
<p>We have roped in a passionate team of engineers, marketing enthusiasts, and finance gurus who have a singular passion to see Portal become the most successful launch in 2015.</p>

<div>
<ul><li><p>What happens if the campaign does not reach its goal?</p></li></ul>
<p>We’re extremely thankful for all our backers thus far, and will turn to individual investors to complete the funding we need to build each of your Portal phones.  We’re incredibly inspired by the fantastic feedback Portal has received thus far, and guarantee you we will not let anything stop us from bringing Portal to life.  We have been in discussions and negotiations with VC firms for a while now.  We hope that with crowd funding, we (the founding team) can keep the majority of ownership in the company and avoid the VC route. </p>
</div>
<div>
<ul><li><p>Do I have to wear it?</p></li></ul>
<p>Well, no.  Its still a smart phone- it just bends so you can.  The cradles are included but they are optional.  You can throw it in your back pocket just like every other phone- except your phone won't be a pain in the rear (literally) and you don't have to worry about breaking it. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<ul><li><p>Where are the hard specs, what's the processor, why aren't there pics of the chips, what's the display resolution, etc?</p></li></ul>
<p>Unfortunately the mobile space is very competitive and every supplier wraps us up in more legal documents than you can imagine.  This is why some of our details are so vague.  Some of them are vague simply for competitive advantage.  You don't see the ""big guys"" publishing specs prior to launch either.  The ""big guys"" just print money so they don't need to expose any details prior to launch so we have somewhat of a disadvantage with that. </p>
<p>Every component manufacturer has a product road map.  The road map shows what they are coming out with 6 months from now, a year from now, sometimes even 2 years from now.  So, we selected a processor that isn't commercially out yet,  but has engineering samples available, and will be ready before we need it to be.  The same thing applies to the display and several other components that make up Portal. <br/></p>
<p>So here's the deal- the simple answer is all of our vendors put us under non-disclosure agreements (NDA).  This is standard practice in most industries but when you get into mobile; whoa you should see how many lawyers get involved with IP licensing, NDA's, etc.  </p>
<p>Since Portal is still being baked, in order to tell you the processor we have selected, what this or that is, etc.; we would have to tell you what our vendors product road maps look like which is their confidential information.  The chip maker isn't going to like a picture of their prototype chip that hasn't been released yet publicly, up on IndieGoGo.  We thought about it but the lawyers got mad at us.  So our hands are tied and we have to be somewhat evasive.</p>
<p>Portal isn't just something we just came up with a few weeks ago.  We've actually been working on Portal for a while now.  </p>
<p>In fact, here's an article from late 2013: </p>
<p><a href=""http://upstart.bizjournals.com/news/technology/2013/12/13/sf-hackers-phone-coming-in-2015.html?page=all"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://upstart.bizjournals.com/news/technology/2013/12/13/sf-hackers-phone-coming-in-2015.html?page=all</a></p>
<p>Here is what we can tell you today:</p>
<p>1. At production release Portal will have the latest and greatest technology commercially available. </p>
<p>2. The processor and all of the chips are well known by name and vendor.  We aren't inventing chips, and we aren't crazy. The majority of the components that make up Portal will be in other smart phones you don't know about yet from the ""big guys"".  There aren't very many mobile chipset manufactures- lets leave it at that. </p>
<p>3. Yes, we do have prototypes and we have been working on this quite a while.</p>
<p>4.  All of our backers will receive detailed information and updates as soon as we can release the data without having lawyers on our doorstep the next day.</p>
<p>5. We intend to make this phone a revolutionary device and throw the book at it for innovation and functionality.  Our motivation is the failures we see as consumers with other manufacturers products.</p>
<p>6.  The specs aren't 100% yet baked in.  Some things will change but for the better.  We intend to max Portal out where it makes sense. At production launch, Portal's specifications will be competitive with other devices being released in the same time frame. </p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><p>What OS is on Portal?</p></li></ul>
<p>Portal runs the latest stable build of stock Android with a custom user interface to support Portal's additional features.  At production, Portal will ship with the latest stable Android build.  </p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><p>Does Portal support Android Apps and Google Play Store?</p></li></ul>
<p>Yes, it's still an Android smart phone and will support most apps from the Google Play Store.  We just had to create a custom user interface to support features like landscape mode.  We think you'll love the user interface- Jonathan put a ton of time into creating it. </p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><p>What type of testing are you doing with Portal?</p></li></ul>
<p>We are testing Portal against MIL-810G standards.  Once we determine the failure points we will then make additional adjustments in the design to correct the issue.  We are also going to do highly-accelerated life testing (HALT) on the final pre-production prototype.  This will show where the failure points are and where we can make improvements if we need to.  Our goal is to make Portal rugged enough that you really can jump out of a plane and send a Tweet at the same time.  Although that may not be a good idea and we are completely advising against it; if you do please use the hashtag  <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/disruptoverload?src=hash"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#<strong>disruptoverload</strong></a>  so we can retweet!</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><p>How bendable is Portal?</p></li></ul>
<p>Well, you won't be rolling it up like a dollar bill.  There are still rigid components within Portal that are strategically placed to allow Portal to flex the way it does.  Portal consists of both flex and rigid PCB material.  This is very common and not a new thing.  Its simply semi-rigid PCB technology that's been around for a long time in many products. </p>
<p>The largest factor in ""bendable"" is really rigid component placement on the circuit board.   Every single resistor, diode, LED, etc. had to be placed with an orientation that will allow maximum flexing without breaking a solder joint.  Where the larger parts are on the PCB, like processor and memory- that's rigid.  Even with the rigid PCB the amount of flex and bend-ability that Portal provides is astounding.  </p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><p>How do you make a phone water proof?</p></li></ul>
<p>We have some tricks up our sleeve.  These days, there are all kinds of compounds out there developed to protect circuit boards from exposure to the elements.  There is cold potting which turns the circuit board into a hockey puck, there is conformal coating which is like putting clear nail polish on top of the circuit board.  There are hundreds of different chemicals, materials, and processes that have been used in other industries to achieve the exact same result.  We'll just say we did some tinkering and made a few discoveries- the rest is top secret for now. </p>

<ul><li><p><span>Does the Portal have Wifi?</span></p></li></ul>
<p>Yes, it does support WiFi - 802.11 b/g/n/ac to be exact.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><p>What's with the battery?</p></li></ul>
<p>None of us are chemists so we partnered with a major well known battery manufacturer to assist us in developing a custom battery for Portal.  Its not an off the shelf battery and we are still testing battery life, charge cycles, and so on.  </p>
<ul><li><p>Will the Portal work internationally? </p></li></ul>
<p>Internationally, it will run on any carrier that supports the wireless over-the-air interface protocols listed in the specifications.  Portal is a quad-band GSM based device with HSPA, LTE, and TD-LTE.  The ability for Portal to operate on a specific carrier is based on the carriers frequencies.  </p>
<ul><li><p>Does the phone come with warranty if it malfunctions?</p></li></ul>
<p>The standard warranty of 1 year will apply to all devices sold by Arubixs regardless of if it was purchased on Indiegogo or other outlets.</p>
<ul><li><p>Where do we get to choose our color? Can we order multiple arm bands?</p></li></ul>
<p>At the end of our campaign we will email each of our backers confirming their orders (including color preferences &amp; band quantities) before shipping out the perks.</p>
<ul><li><p>Why four cameras?</p></li></ul>
<p>We have created an ambidextrous phone.  Two cameras are on the sides to film outward on either side, while the other two are front facing cameras.</p>
<ul><li><p>How does the phone measure heart rates?</p></li></ul>
<p>The Portal utilizes the same technology already existing in many wearable tech products.  See above regarding non-disclosure. </p>
<ul><li><p>What kind of SIM card is used in Portal?</p></li></ul>
<p>Currently we are using an embedded SIM card.  This is essentially a soldered chip on the circuit board.  This isn’t new technology- it’s used mostly in automotive and telematics applications where “rugged” matters for extended temperatures and water resistance.  An embedded SIM card is the same as every other SIM card with the only difference being that you have to call your wireless carrier to do a SIM ID swap instead of just physically swapping out a SIM card.  We did this to make sure that Portal can withstand the abuse of active users.  We intend to still investigate using a nanoSIM however it’s not likely that having a SIM door of any kind will allow Portal to still remain submersible.</p>
<ul><li><p>What certifications are you doing on Portal?</p></li></ul>
<p>We have to do several wireless certifications.  This includes FCC, PTCRB, Bluetooth AG, Wi-Fi Alliance, etc.  We also have to do wireless carrier device certifications for several wireless carriers on the globe.  We have to do a lot of certifications actually, which is why we are doing this crowd funding event.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><p>How nerdy are you guys?</p></li></ul>
<p>Well, if you want to talk about coplanar wave guides, the differences between ENIG and OSP PCB, or MIPS we can go there and somewhat enjoy it.  If you have a ""in the weeds"" question shoot us a message and we'll be happy to discuss.</p>

</div> <p><br/></p></div>","If you’re like us, you've become frustrated with the profit engine known as the smartphone market. A category once synonymous with innovation and technological advancement has been replaced with minor yearly “upgrades,” uninspired design, and a lack of uniqueness.  Manufacturers these days are dumping money into manufacturing technology to make the phones cheaper and at higher volumes; not into developing revolutionary technology. 
We were tired of being told what the epitome of technology and innovation were by the products offered to us on the shelf, so we sought to test those limits for ourselves and ask, “What do we want in a smartphone, and can we do it?”
The answer to that question was something so unique, versatile, and beautiful, we’ve made it our mission to bring it to life.
WHAT IS PORTAL? 
The Portal is a smartphone designed for tech enthusiasts, active individuals, and on-the-go professionals who are frustrated with bulky, cluttered, non-durable phones that constantly get in the way of their dynamic lifestyles. Our goal was to create a device that combines advanced smartphone technology with the convenience and mobility of smart watches and fitness trackers- a handheld phone when you need it, a wearable device when you want it. No longer will you need to carry and connect a smartwatch, fitness tracker and smartphone all at once.  Portal offers you the best of those devices at the times you choose.

HARDWARE 
Portal can be comfortably worn on either forearm and features no ports or cord connectivity, freeing your hands and pockets to keep your life active, connected, and hassle-free.
Portal is scratch & shatter proof, water resistant, and flexible, making it an ideal companion for the most demanding activities.
• Unlocked and usable with most major carriers*
• Soft Impact restive Kevlar infused body
• Durability and flexibly allowing a stress free use
• Button-less design which also makes it water resistant
• Wearability allowing to use your phone on the go at work, exercising, or even if you just have a busy lifestyle 

SOFTWARE 
People on the move want a phone that works with them, not against them- Portal harnesses an revolutionary new customizable user interface that redefines intuitiveness, accessibility and convenience. Most importantly it's stunning beautiful to look at and live with everyday.
• Android Based OS with Portal OS Customizable User Interface
• Ambidextrous (right or left handed) User Interface
• Gesture and motion based native function commands (volume, unlock, home, back, etc.)
• Futuristic new notification and ringtone library 




SPECIFICATIONS 




*Update: The 4"" display will not be available until 2015. 
**Specifications are subject to change to ensure the best available components. We will update all backers on any notable changes.

WHO ARE WE? 
We tech enthusiasts, inventors, and serial entrepreneurs, are passionate about finding solutions rather than waiting for so called established corporations to take care of the issues we customers face.
In the smartphone industry space, innovation is getting limited to making them thinner and lighter with little thought put into making them durable. When we look  at other smart devices such as smart-watches and fitness trackers, we notice that they struggle with limited functionality and stickiness. 
We as a team decided to take this problem head on and have created a device that combines advanced smartphone technology with the convenience and mobility of smart watches and fitness trackers- a handheld phone when you need it, a wearable device when you want it. We named it as “Portal”.
Portal is a new unique Android based smartphone that is flexible, water resistant, shatterproof, and wearable. We are lucky to have award winning team members. Adam Eastman, our lead mechanical engineer is UC Berkeley inventor and entrepreneur. Jonathan Quintin is award winning graphic designer who has led design projects for companies such as Bosch, Google, Intel and Mitsubishi Motors. Dan Daogaru, CTO and award winning HW engineer, is himself a successful serial entrepreneur and has been in the wireless space since the analog phone days. 
We have roped in a passionate team of engineers, marketing enthusiasts, and finance gurus who have a singular passion to see Portal become the most successful launch in 2015.



WHERE ARE WE? 


Started with concepts, sketches, CAD, 3D prints, etc.  Built a team, PCB design, built a few prototypes, mechanical tooling, software development, set up supplier logistics, etc.
Contributions will help in final steps to deliver: 
•	Production & Assembly tooling 
•	Approvals & Certifications
The campaign is to raise initial funding for approvals, certifications, completion of OS development, and support in taking Portal to market. 


RISKS AND CHALLENGES?


Building a smartphone or a tech company isn't rocket science. However, somethings which are out of our hands that play the most risk to our timeline are:
• Testing & Government Certifications
• IP Licensing Negotiations
• Fulfillment Logistics involved in distribution


FULFILLMENT TIMELINE? 
We believe 12 months is incredibly fast for a start-up at our stage. For example Motorola's design to delivery time takes twelve to eighteenth months. We can and will beat that. The campaign is to raise initial funding, which would help us in approvals, certifications, development of OS, and support in taking Portal to market. 

Nov. Final designs are completed
Dec. Volume scale tooling completed
Jan. Components inventory established
Feb. Manufacturing and distribution logistics finalized
Mar. All licensing finalized 
Apr. Final debugging and software iterations completed
May. Government certification and testing submitted
Jun. Government certification approvals completed
Jul. High volume manufacture begins
Aug. Packaging materials and design completed
Sep. Ship to backers
Please keep in mind each month we will email exclusive video up dates with behind the scenes footage to all of our backers.

FAQs 


What happens if the campaign does not reach its goal?
We’re extremely thankful for all our backers thus far, and will turn to individual investors to complete the funding we need to build each of your Portal phones.  We’re incredibly inspired by the fantastic feedback Portal has received thus far, and guarantee you we will not let anything stop us from bringing Portal to life.  We have been in discussions and negotiations with VC firms for a while now.  We hope that with crowd funding, we (the founding team) can keep the majority of ownership in the company and avoid the VC route. 


Do I have to wear it?
Well, no.  Its still a smart phone- it just bends so you can.  The cradles are included but they are optional.  You can throw it in your back pocket just like every other phone- except your phone won't be a pain in the rear (literally) and you don't have to worry about breaking it.  


Where are the hard specs, what's the processor, why aren't there pics of the chips, what's the display resolution, etc?
Unfortunately the mobile space is very competitive and every supplier wraps us up in more legal documents than you can imagine.  This is why some of our details are so vague.  Some of them are vague simply for competitive advantage.  You don't see the ""big guys"" publishing specs prior to launch either.  The ""big guys"" just print money so they don't need to expose any details prior to launch so we have somewhat of a disadvantage with that. 
Every component manufacturer has a product road map.  The road map shows what they are coming out with 6 months from now, a year from now, sometimes even 2 years from now.  So, we selected a processor that isn't commercially out yet,  but has engineering samples available, and will be ready before we need it to be.  The same thing applies to the display and several other components that make up Portal. 
So here's the deal- the simple answer is all of our vendors put us under non-disclosure agreements (NDA).  This is standard practice in most industries but when you get into mobile; whoa you should see how many lawyers get involved with IP licensing, NDA's, etc.

Portal isn't just something we just came up with a few weeks ago.  We've actually been working on Portal for a while now.  
In fact, here's an article from late 2013: 
http://upstart.bizjournals.com/news/technology/2013/12/13/sf-hackers-phone-coming-in-2015.html?page=all
Here is what we can tell you today:
1. At production release Portal will have the latest and greatest technology commercially available. 
2. The processor and all of the chips are well known by name and vendor.  We aren't inventing chips, and we aren't crazy.

5. We intend to make this phone a revolutionary device and throw the book at it for innovation and functionality.  Our motivation is the failures we see as consumers with other manufacturers products.
6.  The specs aren't 100% yet baked in.  Some things will change but for the better.  We intend to max Portal out where it makes sense. At production launch, Portal's specifications will be competitive with other devices being released in the same time frame. 

What OS is on Portal?
Portal runs the latest stable build of stock Android with a custom user interface to support Portal's additional features.  At production, Portal will ship with the latest stable Android build.  

Does Portal support Android Apps and Google Play Store?
Yes, it's still an Android smart phone and will support most apps from the Google Play Store.  We just had to create a custom user interface to support features like landscape mode.  We think you'll love the user interface- Jonathan put a ton of time into creating it. 

What type of testing are you doing with Portal?
We are testing Portal against MIL-810G standards.  Once we determine the failure points we will then make additional adjustments in the design to correct the issue.  We are also going to do highly-accelerated life testing (HALT) on the final pre-production prototype.  This will show where the failure points are and where we can make improvements if we need to.  Our goal is to make Portal rugged enough that you really can jump out of a plane and send a Tweet at the same time.  Although that may not be a good idea and we are completely advising against it; if you do please use the hashtag  #disruptoverload  so we can retweet!

How bendable is Portal?
Well, you won't be rolling it up like a dollar bill.  There are still rigid components within Portal that are strategically placed to allow Portal to flex the way it does.  Portal consists of both flex and rigid PCB material.  This is very common and not a new thing.  Its simply semi-rigid PCB technology that's been around for a long time in many products. 
The largest factor in ""bendable"" is really rigid component placement on the circuit board.   Every single resistor, diode, LED, etc. had to be placed with an orientation that will allow maximum flexing without breaking a solder joint.  Where the larger parts are on the PCB, like processor and memory- that's rigid.  Even with the rigid PCB the amount of flex and bend-ability that Portal provides is astounding.  

How do you make a phone water proof?
We have some tricks up our sleeve.  These days, there are all kinds of compounds out there developed to protect circuit boards from exposure to the elements.  There is cold potting which turns the circuit board into a hockey puck, there is conformal coating which is like putting clear nail polish on top of the circuit board.  There are hundreds of different chemicals, materials, and processes that have been used in other industries to achieve the exact same result.  We'll just say we did some tinkering and made a few discoveries- the rest is top secret for now. 


Does the Portal have Wifi?
Yes, it does support WiFi - 802.11 b/g/n/ac to be exact.

What's with the battery?
None of us are chemists so we partnered with a major well known battery manufacturer to assist us in developing a custom battery for Portal.  Its not an off the shelf battery and we are still testing battery life, charge cycles, and so on.  
Will the Portal work internationally? 
Internationally, it will run on any carrier that supports the wireless over-the-air interface protocols listed in the specifications.  Portal is a quad-band GSM based device with HSPA, LTE, and TD-LTE.  The ability for Portal to operate on a specific carrier is based on the carriers frequencies.  
Does the phone come with warranty if it malfunctions?
The standard warranty of 1 year will apply to all devices sold by Arubixs regardless of if it was purchased on Indiegogo or other outlets.
Where do we get to choose our color? Can we order multiple arm bands?
At the end of our campaign we will email each of our backers confirming their orders (including color preferences & band quantities) before shipping out the perks.
Why four cameras?
We have created an ambidextrous phone.  Two cameras are on the sides to film outward on either side, while the other two are front facing cameras.
How does the phone measure heart rates?
The Portal utilizes the same technology already existing in many wearable tech products.  See above regarding non-disclosure. 
What kind of SIM card is used in Portal?
Currently we are using an embedded SIM card.  This is essentially a soldered chip on the circuit board.  This isn’t new technology- it’s used mostly in automotive and telematics applications where “rugged” matters for extended temperatures and water resistance.  An embedded SIM card is the same as every other SIM card with the only difference being that you have to call your wireless carrier to do a SIM ID swap instead of just physically swapping out a SIM card.  We did this to make sure that Portal can withstand the abuse of active users.  We intend to still investigate using a nanoSIM however it’s not likely that having a SIM door of any kind will allow Portal to still remain submersible.
What certifications are you doing on Portal?
We have to do several wireless certifications.  This includes FCC, PTCRB, Bluetooth AG, Wi-Fi Alliance, etc.  We also have to do wireless carrier device certifications for several wireless carriers on the globe.  We have to do a lot of certifications actually, which is why we are doing this crowd funding event.

How nerdy are you guys?
Well, if you want to talk about coplanar wave guides, the differences between ENIG and OSP PCB, or MIPS we can go there and somewhat enjoy it.  If you have a ""in the weeds"" question shoot us a message and we'll be happy to discuss.

After miraculously surviving two collapsed lungs and seizures, Joshua was able to go home to his family. After multiple trips to the doctor, Joshua was diagnosed with cerebral palsy nine months later.  Cerebral palsy is a congenital disorder that can affect muscle tone, muscle movement, and motor skills. There is no cure for CP but treatments, therapy, and special equipment that can help children living with the condition to help develop skills we take for granted in everyday life. <br/><br/>  Joshua's family attends a program known as the Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential (IAHP) twice a year. After sending Joshua to therapists, Jennifer and Kyle (Joshua's parents), felt that there had to be a more beneficial way to treat their son. The IAHP program guides Jennifer and Kyle on how to treat Joshua at home providing him with the best possible therapists in his life, his parents. By understanding how to help treat their son, Jennifer and Kyle do not need to schedule appointments and take Joshua across the state to provide him treatment. IAHP costs the Bolt family around $5,000 twice a year ($10,000 overall), none of which is paid for by insurance.

There is no cure for CP but treatments, therapy, and special equipment that can help children living with the condition to help develop skills we take for granted in everyday life.   Joshua's family attends a program known as the Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential (IAHP) twice a year. After sending Joshua to therapists, Jennifer and Kyle (Joshua's parents), felt that there had to be a more beneficial way to treat their son. The IAHP program guides Jennifer and Kyle on how to treat Joshua at home providing him with the best possible therapists in his life, his parents. By understanding how to help treat their son, Jennifer and Kyle do not need to schedule appointments and take Joshua across the state to provide him treatment. IAHP costs the Bolt family around $5,000 twice a year ($10,000 overall), none of which is paid for by insurance. This is where you can help.    What We Need & What You Get The goal of this is to raise money for Josh Bolt's family so he can attend the IAHP program. Any donations will be greatly appreciated. 
There will also be a benefit concert on October 25th at Longwood University from 7 pm to 9:30 pm to also raise money. 
The idea for this site is for those that can't attend to still have an opportunity to donate.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are KÖVET Ministries in Debrecen, Hungary, an interdenominational, international Christian association founded in 1995 whose goal is to fulfill the Great Commission focusing on the Roma Community. We, Lajos Kovács and Endre  Szilágyi, have been serving here in Hungary and Barna Cséki in Translyvania, Romania. </p>
<p>The Roma people are in a desperately disadvantaged state in Eastern Europe. In Hungary and Romania, they are a minority, and those who are Hungarian-speakers in Transylvania are double minorities: first as Roma and second as Hungarians. The vast majority of Roma are poor and uneducated; they support their large families through migrant work in the summer and social aid in the winter. They are perceived to be primitive in their behavior and thinking, with their only concern being how to get through today, with planning for the future being a foreign thought. </p>
<p>Our first priority in ministry is to present the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the Roma (or to anyone, for that matter). The Roma need the Gospel, love, humanitarian aid, dignity, acceptance, places of worship - the full package. One of the most distressing sights for us to witness is hungry families, <strong><em>especially during Christmas</em></strong>. Since most of the Roma with whom we are involved only work during the warmer months, a way for us -- and more immportantly, you -- to help during this crucial time of unemployment is to provide a large bag of groceries. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We want to put together and distribute <strong>125 bags</strong> of food for the Christmas holidays for families in our ministry. Each bag will contain necessary items for their celebration: large chicken and or pork, flour, sugar, oil, cocoa, vegetables, margarine, pasta, Hungarian Christmas sweets, etc.</p>
<p>For a donation of at least $20, you will receive a 5"" x 7"" magnetic photo of an aspect of the ministry.  Placed on your refrigerator, you will be reminded of your contribution to help a family in need and also to pray for our ministry.</p>
<p>For a donation of $100 or more, you will receive a full-length CD of Hungarian Roma worship music recorded by our musicians (plus the 5x7 magnetic photo).</p>
<p>Every cent will go towards these food packages! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>If you would like to contribute, but are unable, that's not a problem.  Your prayers are sincerely requested! We believe God can use many avenues to meet he needs of His people.  Feel free to share this project with others who may be able to help financially - use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

The problems of an inventor book
I have been inventing all my life. Not only must you think of the invention, then you must build it, then you must also then try to interest others which is the main problem an inventor faces.
The basic problem is raising funds either privately or from governments which is a huge issue.
I am therefore writing a book, that may help others to understand the problems and dificulties that an inventor faces.

Why is Body Composition?</h3><p>Body composition is body fat and muscle mass in relation to your bones, body tissue, organs and water weight. At the same weight, someone with high body fat and low muscle mass will be vulnerable to health risks, decreased immunity and more rapid aging. Body composition also is reflected in body shape or visual appearance.</p><p>Even if you are at a healthy weight, a beer belly means an excess of visceral fat, which can increase risk of cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes. In your 30s, muscle mass naturally begins to decrease. Starting at 40, if you’re physically inactive, total muscle mass can decrease up to 1% every year. Healthy development of muscle mass alone, can improve overall fitness and lower risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol and hip disease.</p><h3>2. How do you Measure Body Composition?</h3><p>BIA or Bio-electrical Impedance Analysis, analyzes your body composition on the cellular level. By sending a small alternating current through the body, BIA is capable of measuring total body water and resistance to the passage of the current through your body. From this measurement, fat-free body mass, body weight and body fat can be derived.</p><h3>3. Why Measure using Five Frequencies?</h3><p>Lower frequency currents can only measure extracellular water. Meanwhile, higher frequency currents are needed to pass through cell walls measuring intracellular water mass. Multi-frequency measurement highly improves accuracy with the ability to gauge both extracellular and intracellular water mass. Whereas traditional BCA machines used a single frequency at 50kHz, RIDM operates across a range of five frequencies</p><h3>4. How do you Measure Body Composition with RIDM?</h3><p>RIDM offers two distinct modes to measure body composition.

 “I used RIDM once a day just looking at my body fat and muscle. I saw that cutting down my carbohydrate intake was the most effective in reducing body fat. Checking my muscle composition for imbalances, I realized I had been skipping leg days so I changed up my routine to focus on legs at least twice a week. I started in January and by mid-March, my whole body shape had changed.” - Jack Kim FITNESS ≠ WEIGHTYour fitness and health cannot be measured by numbers on a scale, waist size or image in the mirror. Take a data-driven approach to your fitness by understanding your body composition and tracking how it changes.A healthy body composition is a healthy balance of fat and muscle in relation to your total body weight. Body composition is a crucial health indicator used by both physicians and personal trainers the world over. THE RIDM DIFFERENCEExisting portable body composition analyzers including body fat scales suffer from an accuracy problem. Not only do they take an impartial reading of the body, using one frequency they lack the technology to measure total body composition.RIDM is the FIRST portable body composition analyzer with MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY and ACCURACY equivalent to PROFESSIONAL-GRADE Body Composition machines. 1. MEASURING BODY SEGMENTS INDIVIDUALLY  : RIDM is capable of scanning imbalances in body composition. 2. USING MULTIPLE FREQUENCIES (5 FREQUENCIES)  : RIDM is capable of measuring your water weight on a cellular level.   PROVEN ACCURACY RIDM has undergone clinical testing for accuracy compared to body composition leaders, InBody and the DEXA Index. RIDM's unique measurement of individual body segments offers heightened accuracy.RIDM v.s.

We know what it is to frantically call known and unknown people alike to ask if they would be able to donate blood. We know what it is to see your loved one on a hospital bed, ready for an operation, but waiting for blood.<br/><br/>And then it dawned upon us. If smart phones and the Internet can help us share photographs and videos instantly with our friends, why not use that connectivity for saving lives? Can we create a social group of people who can help each other during an emergency? And, thus began <a href=""http://bloodlinelabs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Bloodline Labs"">Bloodline Labs</a> (<a href=""http://bloodlinelabs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://bloodlinelabs.com</a>)<br/><br/>Bloodline is a network and a mobile application to help you connect with blood donors and healthcare facilities instantaneously. At the critical hour, what if your mobile could help you find donors? And instead of providing you with an outdated list of regular-donors who may or may not be available to help you, Bloodline will contact people at that very moment, just for you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Here's how it works, in a nutshell.</em></p>

Little do we realize that on the other end, it is actually a person, a human being like you or I who actually needs this life-force-fluid to even live. <em>It is a privilege to be sitting behind a laptop and safely marking those emails as read.</em><br/><br/>We hope to sensitise you to this problem of Blood Donation. It is a simple affair - takes hardly half an hour of your time. It means being able to live for someone else.<br/><br/>Our idea has been receiving good response from various platforms, both in India, and abroad, right from the NASSCOM Social Innovation Honors to the Stanford E-Bootcamp. And now we’ve taken the idea further. We are a step closer to achieving what we started. The <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bloodlinelabs.bloodline"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bloodline Android Application</a> is out. <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bloodlinelabs.bloodline"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Download the Bloodline App from the Google Play Store</a> now. <em>A click of the button now, and you would probably be saving a life <span class=""aBn""><span class=""aQJ"">tomorrow</span></span>.</em></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How can you help?</strong></p>
<p>We intend to keep Bloodline a free service. It makes no sense to us to ask someone to pay to find someone to donate blood. It's a matter of crucial importance, and we cannot let money tamper with our humanity. However, we need <em>your help</em> to keep this running.

We know what it is to frantically call known and unknown people alike to ask if they would be able to donate blood. We know what it is to see your loved one on a hospital bed, ready for an operation, but waiting for blood.And then it dawned upon us. If smart phones and the Internet can help us share photographs and videos instantly with our friends, why not use that connectivity for saving lives? Can we create a social group of people who can help each other during an emergency? And, thus began Bloodline Labs (http://bloodlinelabs.com)Bloodline is a network and a mobile application to help you connect with blood donors and healthcare facilities instantaneously. At the critical hour, what if your mobile could help you find donors? And instead of providing you with an outdated list of regular-donors who may or may not be available to help you, Bloodline will contact people at that very moment, just for you.
 
Here's how it works, in a nutshell.
Receive Help - right when you need it.

 
Donate Blood - save someone's life.
Admittedly, almost all of us just ignore those ""Blood Required"" e-mails that we get. Little do we realize that on the other end, it is actually a person, a human being like you or I who actually needs this life-force-fluid to even live. It is a privilege to be sitting behind a laptop and safely marking those emails as read.We hope to sensitise you to this problem of Blood Donation. It is a simple affair - takes hardly half an hour of your time. It means being able to live for someone else.Our idea has been receiving good response from various platforms, both in India, and abroad, right from the NASSCOM Social Innovation Honors to the Stanford E-Bootcamp. And now we’ve taken the idea further. We are a step closer to achieving what we started. The Bloodline Android Application is out. Download the Bloodline App from the Google Play Store now. A click of the button now, and you would probably be saving a life tomorrow.
 
How can you help?
We intend to keep Bloodline a free service. It makes no sense to us to ask someone to pay to find someone to donate blood. It's a matter of crucial importance, and we cannot let money tamper with our humanity. However, we need your help to keep this running. Our costs include infrastructure, such as server space, hosting, services, etc. We hope to be able to reach out to greater crowds through on-ground publicity, for which we again need investments for posters, so on and so forth. It is our goal to bridge this dire need for blood. We hope money, or lack thereof doesn't stand in our way. We need your help.
We came together to make a difference. We know that you will stand by us.

<p><strong>Fitness is my passion</strong></p>
<p>I have been an athlete since I first climbed out of my crib at fourteen months old.  I may have fallen, and fallen hard as the story is told, but I'll be damned if the next night I didn't try again.  I believe that it was since then that my passion and persistence for sports and fitness began.  Playing every sport throughout high school (MVP in many), a few in college and then boxing post school, fitness never left my world.  However, it may have left my day-to-day life.  While dealing with family tragedies, I put on 90+ pounds and didn't think I would ever get back to where I once was.  It wasn't until I was introduced to places like Flywheel Sports and Barry's Boot camp and met incredible friends and amazingly inspiring people there, that I realized that the passion for fitness that I thought I lost, was only just hidden.</p>
<p><strong>Fit Journey is born</strong></p>
<p>It was through my weight gain, loss of hope and regaining of hope AND passion that Fit Journey was born.  The excitement and beauty I feel from fitness and the feelings behind getting stronger and bettering myself through my own actions is something that I think every person should feel.  Being overweight is tough, period.  But, if one person can connect with me, can see me as their equal going through this journey with them and better themselves, than this whole website is worth it.  However, by helping me fund this project, I can help and connect with so many people.  This is a website with no judgment, no pre-determined expectations beside being good to yourself and working alongside me and our Fit Journey community.</p>
<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p>We are very lucky in that we have secured enough funding for the first two months for the site.  However, to really hit the core demographic we are looking to reach, and make sure the site is able to run till then, that will take six months.</p>
<p><strong>Your Support Will Go Toward</strong></p>
<p>-Since we are an Internet based business, we want to hire an online social marketing team to really get our name out there.</p>
<p>-Production costs for training (strength, yoga etc) video shoots</p>
<p>-Production costs for cooking video shoots</p>
<p>-Paying our top fitness and health experts and writers for their articles</p>
<p>-Adding more features to the website</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>There are amazing videos, TV shows &amp; articles on weight loss and bettering yourself out there.  However, there are no heroes.  There is no one out there for 1/3 of the population of the US to look up to and really go through the journey WITH.  In REAL time and really getting to know this person.  I want to reach out to people and become their inspiration as they go through this journey with me.  Every piece of my journey, good, bad, beautiful and hideous will be out there.  Your support will help us change lives.  Your support will help us meet people, reach people and inspire people.  It will help us create and give the tools needed to change people's lives and that is what I am so beyond excited about.</p>

<p><b>Find your files faster, manage them efficiently</b></p>
<p>Using pixx.io you will always find the photos and files you are looking for, right when you
	need them. Simply type in a keyword and the matching files appear. Additionally, you can filter
	your media by date, GPS coordinates, size, orientation and many further characteristics. When
	managing or editing your data, you can use the batch bulk processing function of pixx.io. This
	makes working with your photos and files easy and efficient.<br/><br/></p>

<p><b>Collections facilitate your daily workflow</b></p>
<p>If your images are used, downloaded or shared together frequently, collections will
	facilitate your daily workflow. This applies if you are collecting photos for the next
	catalogue, sending out a portfolio once in a while, or simply want to group files together for
	various projects. The collections feature of pixx.io offers everything you need for a fast and
	efficient workflow.<br/><br/></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/853702/files/20140913045356-share-files.jpg?1410609236"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Share your files – fast and secure</b></p>
<p>Using pixx.io you can share your photos with customers, colleagues and friends – quickly and
	securely. You decide which size you give out your files. You determine how long and how often
	the recipient can open the shared collection. Furthermore you need just one click to integrate
	a watermark in all the pictures, no matter if you are sharing five or 500 files. In addition every
	sharing activity is recorded, meaning you have full control on who shared what with whom, in
	which format.</p>
<p>The addressee will then get a link via email to view and download the shared collection.
	They can use their laptop, smartphone or tablet. No additional software installation is
	needed.<br/><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/853703/files/20140913045435-cloud-back-home.jpg?1410609275"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<h1 style=""font-weight: 200;"">Shipping</h1>
<p>Where we ship</p>
<p>We ship to the EU, the US and Canada. Free shippingin the EU. Add 30€ for shipping to the US
	and Canada.</p>
<p>When we start shipping<span> </span></p>
<p>We start shipping in February 2015. We will notify you when your pixx.io box is on its way to
	you. If there is a balance due, we will charge the rest to your credit card at this time. The
	pixx.io box will take about a week to get to you if you are in the EU, and 2-3 weeks if you are
	in the US or Canada.</p>
<h1 style=""font-weight: 200;"">Risks and Challenges</h1>
<p>The biggest risk we face is undiscovered bugs in the pixx.io software. Until now we
	developed a very stable beta version of the software, which runs the pixx.io box. To find bugs
	and improve the software we are working together with various SMEs,
	professional/semi-professional photographers and design agencies, who are beta testing pixx.io.
	During this intensive improvement process problems might arise that our programmers never
	considered. This might, in the worst case, delay the delivery of pixx.io box.</p>
<p>To meet international standards we are testing the pixx.io box according to CE and FCC
	guidelines. Experts have assured us we will not have problems passing the tests. But there is
	still the risk we will not meet the standards the first time. If so, we would need to adjust
	the enclosure of the pixx.io box, and test it again. This might, in the worst case, delay the
	delivery of pixx.io box.</p>
<p>For the production of the pixx.io box we are working together with an experienced hardware
	supplier. He is able to scale production to our needs. But, if the number of supporters exceeds
	all we imagined in our wildest dreams, the supplier might need to reserve more production
	capacities for the pixx.io box. This might also result in a delay of the delivery date.</p>

<p id=""hardware"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"">
	Hardware</p>
<p id=""nas_en"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Is the pixx.io box just a NAS (Network Attached Storage)?</p>
<p style=""""></p>
<p>No. The pixx.io box is a mini server with a high performance processor. This means, the pixx.io box does not just store photos and files, but processes them efficiently. High-resolution JPGs, RAW-files and PSDs for example are directly converted into small JPGs (1920px width). These files are used whenever possible. At the same time the originals are archived and stay untouched until you need them. Further all images are resized on demand for optimal fit to the screen of your device (laptop, desktop, tablet, etc.) This drastically reduces loading and processing times.</p>
<span></span>
<p></p>
<p id=""voltage"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">What voltage does the pixx.io box
	use?</p>
<p style=""""></p>
<p>The power supply of the pixx.io box comes with an external power adapter. Depending on the
	country you are ordering from you will get the power adapter you need. If you are
	ordering from an EU country you will get a 230V adapter. If you are ordering from Canada or the
	US, you will get a 120V adapter.</p>
<span></span>
<p></p>
<p id=""memspace"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">How much memory space do I have
	on my pixx.io box?</p>
<p style=""""></p>
<p>The pixx.io box contains two 1 TB hard drives. To guarantee the highest possible safety for
	your data, the hard drives are completely mirrored. You can effectively use 1 TB to store your
	photos and data. This means you can manage about 200,000 files (assuming 5 MB per file).
	Additionally you have a complete backup of all your files. The pixx.io software runs on a
	separate 30 GB flash drive.</p>
<p><i>Furthermore you can store up to 1,000 pictures and two collections in the pixx.io cloud
	account you get for free with your pixx.io box.</i><br/></p>
<p style=""""><span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p id=""safety"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">How safe are the photos stored on
	my pixx.io box?</p>
<p style=""""></p>
<p>The files you store on your pixx.io box are very safe. Because of the two independently
	working, and constantly mirrored hard drives, your files always exist twice on your pixx.io
	box. This means if, for any reason, one hard drive breaks down, your files are still secured on
	the second hard drive.</p>
<p><i></i><b style="""">What happens if the storage space on my pixx.io box is
	full?</b></p>
<p id=""pro"" style=""""></p>
<p>In your pixx.io box you can effectively use 1 TB of storage. This is enough for plenty of
	photos and files. If you are really running out of storage at some point, you can get the
	pixx.io box storage extension. This extension is simply connected with the eSATA port at the
	back of the pixx.io box. With this extension you can enlarge the storage space of your box. The
	user interface, all the functions and your existing files remain as they are, just your storage
	is enlarged.</p>
<b style="""">Do I need to be an IT pro to install and to use
	the pixx.io box?</b>
<p style=""""></p>
<p>No. There is no need to be an IT pro for installing and using your pixx.io box. You simply
	need to plug the pixx.io box in to your existing network (e.g. via your
	router/FRITZ!Box/etc...). After that you can access pixx.io with any browser on any device in
	your network. The only thing you need is the login data which comes with the box.</p>
<p></p>
<p id=""users"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">How many users can have access to
	my pixx.io box?</p>
<p style=""""></p>
<p>The number of users is unlimited as long as they are using the same user account. You will
	have one general account with full rights and one guest account with limited rights. You can
	also work with various devices and one pixx.io box at the same time.</p>
<p>If you are in need of a solution with detailed user and rights management please contact the
	pixx.io team. In this case the pixx.io server version offers you a broad range of features
	adapted for the needs of SMEs and larger companies.</p>

<p id=""software"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"">
	Software</p>
<p id=""languages"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Which languages does the
	pixx.io box support?</p>
<p style="""">pixx.io is multilingual. This means theoretically every language
	can be implemented very easily. In the beginning you can chose between the two languages
	English (US) and German. Eventually we will offer new language packages (like French, Spanish
	and Finnish) to download. Each time you log into pixx.io you can choose between all the
	languages installed.</p>
<p style="""">The user manual and support videos will only be available in
	English and German.</p>
<p id=""formats"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Which file formats can I upload
	to my pixx.io box?</p>
<p><i></i>You can upload nearly every file format to pixx.io and work with it. But you have to
	keep in mind that pixx.io is optimized for images and graphic files (e.g. jpg, png, gif, psd,
	idd, pdf, etc...) This is why some functions can only be applied to these file formats.</p>
<p id=""nosoftware"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Do I need to install any
	software to use pixx.io?</p>
<p style="""">No. All the software you need is preinstalled on the pixx.io box.
	The only thing you need is a device with a browser (e.g Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet
	Explorer, etc...) on it.</p>
<p id=""specialos"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Do I need a special operating
	system to use pixx.io?</p>
<p style="""">No. You can use pixx.io with any operating system. It works
	equally well with Microsoft, Apple, Linux or Android. The operating system only needs to be
	able to run a browser.<br/></p>
<p id=""browser"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Which browser do I need to use
	pixx.io?</p>
<p style="""">pixx.io is ready to be used with any browser. Currently we are
	optimizing the software for the latest versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft
	Internet Explorer and Apple Safari.</p>
<p></p>
<p id=""tablet"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Can I use pixx.io on my
	tablet?</p>
<p style=""""></p>
<p>Yes, you can. pixx.io is optimized for use on tablets, laptops and desktop computers.</p>
<p></p>
<p id=""smartphone"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Can I use pixx.io on my
	smartphone?</p>
<p style="""">Yes, there is a mobile version of pixx.io as well, due to the
	limited screen size you will not have all functions available when using pixx.io on your
	smartphone. For the best experience, use pixx.io on your tablet, laptop or desktop
	computer.</p>

<p id=""hardware_de"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"">Hardware</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p id=""nas_de"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ist die pixx.io box ein NAS?</p>
<p>Nein. Die pixx.io box ist kein NAS, sondern ein leistungsstarker Mini-Server. Das bedeutet, Fotos und Dateien werden auf der pixx.io box nicht nur sicher gespeichert, sondern auch effizient verarbeitet. Hochauflösende JPGs, RAW-Dateien und PSDs beispielsweise werden direkt beim Upload im Original abgelegt. Gleichzeitig wird die Datei in ein kleines JPG mit 1920Px Breite umgewandelt. Mit diesem Bild wird dann, wann immer möglich gearbeitet. Zudem rechnet die pixx.io box in Bruchteilen einer Sekunde alle Bilder so um, dass sie auf Ihrem Endgerät (Laptop, Tablet, Smartphone, etc.) immer optimal dargestellt werden. Dies minimiert Ladezeiten und macht das Arbeiten mit der pixx.io box besonders schnell und effizient. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p id=""voltage_de"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Für welche Netzspannung ist die
				pixx.io box ausgelegt?</p>
<p>Die pixx.io box wird mit einem externen Netzteil betrieben. Deshalb kann die
				pixx.io box sowohl bei 230 V, als auch bei 120 V Netzspannung problemlos betrieben
				werden. Je nach Wohnort liefern wir Ihnen das passende Netzteil kostenlos, zusammen
				mit Ihrer pixx.io box.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""""></p>
<p id=""memspace_de"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Wie groß ist der Speicherplatz auf
				der pixx.io box?</p>
<p>In der pixx.io box sind zwei 1 TB große Festplatten verbaut. Um Ihre Daten auch
				im Ernstfall zu schützen sind diese gespiegelt. Es steht also effektiv 1 TB
				Speicherplatz zum Speichern Ihrer Bilder und Dateien zur Verfügung. Das entspricht
				etwa 200.000 Fotos (5 MB je Foto). Die pixx.io Software wir auf einem seperatem 30
				GB großen Flash-Speicher im Gerät ausgeführt.<br/></p>
<p>Zusätzlich steht jedem Nutzer der pixx.io box dauerhaft ein kostenloser pixx.io
				cloud Account mit Speicherplatz für 1.000 Fotos und 2 Kollektionen zur Verfügung.
				Dieser kann genutzt werden um Fotos und Dateien mit anderen zu teilen.</p>
<p id=""safety_de""></p>
<b>Wie sicher sind meine Fotos auf der pixx.io box?<br/><br/></b>
<p>Die Fotos auf der pixx.io box sind sehr sicher. Durch die zwei unabhängigen,
				gespiegelten Festplatten sind Ihre Fotos und Daten immer doppelt in der pixx.io box
				gespeichert. Sollte wirklich einmal eine Festplatte nach langjähriger Nutzung
				nichtmehr funktionieren, sind Ihre Daten immer noch vollständig und im
				Originalformat auf der zweiten Festplatte gesichert. Diese funktioniert unabhängig
				von der anderen Festplatte.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p id=""storage_de"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Was passiert, wenn meine pixx.io box
				voll ist?</p>
<p>Auf der pixx.io box steht Ihnen 1 TB Speicherplatz zur Verfügung. Das reicht für
				sehr viele Fotos und Dateien. Sollten Sie jedoch trotzdem mehr Speicherplatz
				benötigen, steht Ihnen die Speicherplatzerweiterung der pixx.io box zur Verfügung.
				Diese kann einfach, mittels inkludiertem eSata-Kabel, an Ihre pixx.io box
				angeschlossen werden. An der Nutzung Ihrer pixx.io box ändert sich dann Garnichts,
				es steht einfach zusätzlicher Speicherplatz zur Verfügung.</p>
<p id=""pro_de"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Brauche ich zur Einrichtung und Nutzung
				der pixx.io box IT-Fachwissen?</p>
<p>Nein. Die pixx.io box wird einfach mit dem beiliegenden Kabel an das eigene
				Netzwerk angebunden (z.B. über den eigenen Router/ FRITZ!Box). Nach dem Einstecken
				können Sie die passwortgeschützten Daten dann mit jedem verbundenen Endgerät
				abrufen. Egal ob Desktop, Laptop, Tablet oder Smartphone. Egal ob Apple oder
				Microsoft.<br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p id=""users_de"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Wie viele Anwender können auf die
				pixx.io box zugreifen?</p>
<p>Auf die Daten der pixx.io box können unbegrenzt viele User zugreifen. Jedoch
				müssen diesen dann alle denselben Nutzerzugang verwenden. Eine Differenzierung von
				Rechten ist hierbei leider nicht möglich. Auch Empfehlen wir die pixx.io box nicht
				mit mehr als fünf Anwendern gleichzeitig zu nutzen, das sich sonst die
				Rechenkapazität, die jedem Nutzer zu Verfügung steht, merklich verringert.<br/></p>
<p>Sollten Sie, beispielsweise als Unternehmen, Interesse an einer differenzierten
				Rechteverwaltung haben, wenden Sie sich bitte an das pixx.io Team. Die pixx.io
				server Version bietet Ihnen eine breite Rechteverwaltung und zahlreiche weitere
				Features für Unternehmen.</p>

				pixx.io verwalten?</p>
<p>Grundsätzlich können mit pixx.io fast alle Dateiformate verwaltet werden.
				pixx.io ist jedoch auf die Verarbeitung von Bild- und Grafikdateien optimiert.
				Deshalb gibt es einige Funktionen, z.B. das Einfügen von Wasserzeichen, oder
				verschiedene Filter, die nur mit Bilddateien (jpg, png, gif, psd, idd, etc.)
				durchgeführt werden können.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p id=""nosoftware_de"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Muss ich zusätzliche Software

Software

pixx.io is the home for all your photos and files. It is the basis for archiving, collecting
	and sharing all kinds of media. Fast, easy and safe.

Find your files faster, manage them efficiently
Using pixx.io you will always find the photos and files you are looking for, right when you
	need them. Simply type in a keyword and the matching files appear. Additionally, you can filter
	your media by date, GPS coordinates, size, orientation and many further characteristics. When
	managing or editing your data, you can use the batch bulk processing function of pixx.io. This
	makes working with your photos and files easy and efficient.

Collections facilitate your daily workflow
If your images are used, downloaded or shared together frequently, collections will
	facilitate your daily workflow. This applies if you are collecting photos for the next
	catalogue, sending out a portfolio once in a while, or simply want to group files together for
	various projects. The collections feature of pixx.io offers everything you need for a fast and
	efficient workflow.

Share your files – fast and secure
Using pixx.io you can share your photos with customers, colleagues and friends – quickly and
	securely. You decide which size you give out your files. You determine how long and how often
	the recipient can open the shared collection. Furthermore you need just one click to integrate
	a watermark in all the pictures, no matter if you are sharing five or 500 files. In addition every
	sharing activity is recorded, meaning you have full control on who shared what with whom, in
	which format.
The addressee will then get a link via email to view and download the shared collection.
	They can use their laptop, smartphone or tablet. No additional software installation is
	needed.
On the pixx.io box your photos and files are safe
With the help of the pixx.io box all your photos and files are in your office, living room
	or photographic studio. No files will be saved on servers  around the world, no
	strangers will have access to your files. Even if you are sharing photos with pixx.io, only the
	selected files in the format you chose will be sent. The original files will remain untouched
	and only on your pixx.io box at all time.
At the same time the pixx.io box offers all the advantages of a cloud solution. It is the
	same if you are using a Mac or Microsoft, the same if you are using a laptop, a tablet or a
	smartphone – you will always have fast and easy access to your photos and files without
	installing anything on the device you are using.

How the pixx.io box can help you
Share your files & maintain control
The pixx.io box allows you to share your files with friends, colleagues and customers
	quickly easy. At the same time it helps you maintain control over your shared files by setting
	timeframes for the usage, resizing images before they are shared and adding watermarks.
Always find the files you need
The intuitive text search field, the several filters (e.g. size, orientation, date created,
	etc…) and the GPS location scanner help you find the right photos and files, when you need
	them. No more clicking through complicated folder structures.
Protect your pictures with watermarks
If you are sharing photos, you may want to make sure they contain a watermark. With one
	click pixx.io burns freely selectable and irreversible watermarks on these files. No matter if you
	are sharing five or 500 pictures.
Process your files faster
A fast 2 GHz quad-core processor ensures that even large files of 50 MB or more are
	processed and archived quickly and smoothly.
Work more efficiently
Batch bulk processing is the best way to make your work more efficient. It works the same if
	you are editing, tagging or downloading images. A single click will change and move all
	selected files at the same time.
Your files are safe
Two permanently mirrored hard drives guarantee your important photos and files are safe at
	all times. Even in the unlikely event of a hard drive crash you will not lose a single
	byte.
Access files with any device
It’s the same with tablet, smartphone, laptop or desktop computer. You can access all the
	files stored on the pixx.io box with any device in your network that runs a browser.
The originals stay untouched
It does not matter what you are doing with your files - resizing, sharing or adding
	watermarks. You are always working with identical copies. The originals are always untouched,

Strech goals


Shipping
Where we ship
We ship to the EU, the US and Canada. Free shippingin the EU. Add 30€ for shipping to the US
	and Canada.
When we start shipping 
We start shipping in February 2015. We will notify you when your pixx.io box is on its way to
	you. If there is a balance due, we will charge the rest to your credit card at this time. The
	pixx.io box will take about a week to get to you if you are in the EU, and 2-3 weeks if you are
	in the US or Canada.
Risks and Challenges
The biggest risk we face is undiscovered bugs in the pixx.io software. Until now we
	developed a very stable beta version of the software, which runs the pixx.io box. To find bugs
	and improve the software we are working together with various SMEs,
	professional/semi-professional photographers and design agencies, who are beta testing pixx.io.
	During this intensive improvement process problems might arise that our programmers never
	considered. This might, in the worst case, delay the delivery of pixx.io box.
To meet international standards we are testing the pixx.io box according to CE and FCC
	guidelines. Experts have assured us we will not have problems passing the tests. But there is
	still the risk we will not meet the standards the first time. If so, we would need to adjust
	the enclosure of the pixx.io box, and test it again. This might, in the worst case, delay the
	delivery of pixx.io box.
For the production of the pixx.io box we are working together with an experienced hardware
	supplier. He is able to scale production to our needs. But, if the number of supporters exceeds
	all we imagined in our wildest dreams, the supplier might need to reserve more production
	capacities for the pixx.io box. This might also result in a delay of the delivery date.

	Hardware
Is the pixx.io box just a NAS (Network Attached Storage)?

No. The pixx.io box is a mini server with a high performance processor. This means, the pixx.io box does not just store photos and files, but processes them efficiently. High-resolution JPGs, RAW-files and PSDs for example are directly converted into small JPGs (1920px width). These files are used whenever possible. At the same time the originals are archived and stay untouched until you need them. Further all images are resized on demand for optimal fit to the screen of your device (laptop, desktop, tablet, etc.) This drastically reduces loading and processing times.


What voltage does the pixx.io box
	use?

The power supply of the pixx.io box comes with an external power adapter. Depending on the
	country you are ordering from you will get the power adapter you need. If you are
	ordering from an EU country you will get a 230V adapter. If you are ordering from Canada or the
	US, you will get a 120V adapter.


How much memory space do I have
	on my pixx.io box?

The pixx.io box contains two 1 TB hard drives. To guarantee the highest possible safety for
	your data, the hard drives are completely mirrored. You can effectively use 1 TB to store your
	photos and data. This means you can manage about 200,000 files (assuming 5 MB per file).
	Additionally you have a complete backup of all your files. The pixx.io software runs on a
	separate 30 GB flash drive.
Furthermore you can store up to 1,000 pictures and two collections in the pixx.io cloud
	account you get for free with your pixx.io box.


How safe are the photos stored on
	my pixx.io box?

The files you store on your pixx.io box are very safe. Because of the two independently
	working, and constantly mirrored hard drives, your files always exist twice on your pixx.io
	box. This means if, for any reason, one hard drive breaks down, your files are still secured on
	the second hard drive.
What happens if the storage space on my pixx.io box is
	full?

In your pixx.io box you can effectively use 1 TB of storage. This is enough for plenty of
	photos and files. If you are really running out of storage at some point, you can get the
	pixx.io box storage extension. This extension is simply connected with the eSATA port at the
	back of the pixx.io box. With this extension you can enlarge the storage space of your box. The
	user interface, all the functions and your existing files remain as they are, just your storage
	is enlarged.
Do I need to be an IT pro to install and to use
	the pixx.io box?

No. There is no need to be an IT pro for installing and using your pixx.io box. You simply
	need to plug the pixx.io box in to your existing network (e.g. via your
	router/FRITZ!Box/etc...). After that you can access pixx.io with any browser on any device in
	your network. The only thing you need is the login data which comes with the box.

How many users can have access to
	my pixx.io box?

The number of users is unlimited as long as they are using the same user account. You will
	have one general account with full rights and one guest account with limited rights. You can
	also work with various devices and one pixx.io box at the same time.
If you are in need of a solution with detailed user and rights management please contact the
	pixx.io team. In this case the pixx.io server version offers you a broad range of features
	adapted for the needs of SMEs and larger companies.



	Software
Which languages does the
	pixx.io box support?
pixx.io is multilingual. This means theoretically every language
	can be implemented very easily. In the beginning you can chose between the two languages
	English (US) and German. Eventually we will offer new language packages (like French, Spanish
	and Finnish) to download. Each time you log into pixx.io you can choose between all the
	languages installed.
The user manual and support videos will only be available in
	English and German.
Which file formats can I upload
	to my pixx.io box?
You can upload nearly every file format to pixx.io and work with it. But you have to
	keep in mind that pixx.io is optimized for images and graphic files (e.g. jpg, png, gif, psd,
	idd, pdf, etc...) This is why some functions can only be applied to these file formats.
Do I need to install any
	software to use pixx.io?
No. All the software you need is preinstalled on the pixx.io box.
	The only thing you need is a device with a browser (e.g Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet
	Explorer, etc...) on it.
Do I need a special operating
	system to use pixx.io?
No. You can use pixx.io with any operating system. It works
	equally well with Microsoft, Apple, Linux or Android. The operating system only needs to be
	able to run a browser.
Which browser do I need to use
	pixx.io?
pixx.io is ready to be used with any browser. Currently we are
	optimizing the software for the latest versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft
	Internet Explorer and Apple Safari.

Can I use pixx.io on my
	tablet?

Yes, you can. pixx.io is optimized for use on tablets, laptops and desktop computers.

Can I use pixx.io on my
	smartphone?
Yes, there is a mobile version of pixx.io as well, due to the
	limited screen size you will not have all functions available when using pixx.io on your
	smartphone. For the best experience, use pixx.io on your tablet, laptop or desktop
	computer.

Hardware

Ist die pixx.io box ein NAS?
Nein. Die pixx.io box ist kein NAS, sondern ein leistungsstarker Mini-Server. Das bedeutet, Fotos und Dateien werden auf der pixx.io box nicht nur sicher gespeichert, sondern auch effizient verarbeitet. Hochauflösende JPGs, RAW-Dateien und PSDs beispielsweise werden direkt beim Upload im Original abgelegt. Gleichzeitig wird die Datei in ein kleines JPG mit 1920Px Breite umgewandelt. Mit diesem Bild wird dann, wann immer möglich gearbeitet. Zudem rechnet die pixx.io box in Bruchteilen einer Sekunde alle Bilder so um, dass sie auf Ihrem Endgerät (Laptop, Tablet, Smartphone, etc.) immer optimal dargestellt werden. Dies minimiert Ladezeiten und macht das Arbeiten mit der pixx.io box besonders schnell und effizient. 

Für welche Netzspannung ist die
				pixx.io box ausgelegt?
Die pixx.io box wird mit einem externen Netzteil betrieben. Deshalb kann die
				pixx.io box sowohl bei 230 V, als auch bei 120 V Netzspannung problemlos betrieben
				werden. Je nach Wohnort liefern wir Ihnen das passende Netzteil kostenlos, zusammen
				mit Ihrer pixx.io box.


Wie groß ist der Speicherplatz auf
				der pixx.io box?
In der pixx.io box sind zwei 1 TB große Festplatten verbaut. Um Ihre Daten auch
				im Ernstfall zu schützen sind diese gespiegelt. Es steht also effektiv 1 TB
				Speicherplatz zum Speichern Ihrer Bilder und Dateien zur Verfügung. Das entspricht
				etwa 200.000 Fotos (5 MB je Foto). Die pixx.io Software wir auf einem seperatem 30
				GB großen Flash-Speicher im Gerät ausgeführt.
Zusätzlich steht jedem Nutzer der pixx.io box dauerhaft ein kostenloser pixx.io
				cloud Account mit Speicherplatz für 1.000 Fotos und 2 Kollektionen zur Verfügung.
				Dieser kann genutzt werden um Fotos und Dateien mit anderen zu teilen.

Wie sicher sind meine Fotos auf der pixx.io box?
Die Fotos auf der pixx.io box sind sehr sicher. Durch die zwei unabhängigen,
				gespiegelten Festplatten sind Ihre Fotos und Daten immer doppelt in der pixx.io box
				gespeichert. Sollte wirklich einmal eine Festplatte nach langjähriger Nutzung
				nichtmehr funktionieren, sind Ihre Daten immer noch vollständig und im
				Originalformat auf der zweiten Festplatte gesichert. Diese funktioniert unabhängig
				von der anderen Festplatte.


Was passiert, wenn meine pixx.io box
				voll ist?
Auf der pixx.io box steht Ihnen 1 TB Speicherplatz zur Verfügung. Das reicht für
				sehr viele Fotos und Dateien. Sollten Sie jedoch trotzdem mehr Speicherplatz
				benötigen, steht Ihnen die Speicherplatzerweiterung der pixx.io box zur Verfügung.
				Diese kann einfach, mittels inkludiertem eSata-Kabel, an Ihre pixx.io box
				angeschlossen werden. An der Nutzung Ihrer pixx.io box ändert sich dann Garnichts,
				es steht einfach zusätzlicher Speicherplatz zur Verfügung.
Brauche ich zur Einrichtung und Nutzung
				der pixx.io box IT-Fachwissen?
Nein. Die pixx.io box wird einfach mit dem beiliegenden Kabel an das eigene
				Netzwerk angebunden (z.B. über den eigenen Router/ FRITZ!Box). Nach dem Einstecken
				können Sie die passwortgeschützten Daten dann mit jedem verbundenen Endgerät
				abrufen. Egal ob Desktop, Laptop, Tablet oder Smartphone. Egal ob Apple oder
				Microsoft.

Wie viele Anwender können auf die
				pixx.io box zugreifen?
Auf die Daten der pixx.io box können unbegrenzt viele User zugreifen. Jedoch
				müssen diesen dann alle denselben Nutzerzugang verwenden. Eine Differenzierung von
				Rechten ist hierbei leider nicht möglich. Auch Empfehlen wir die pixx.io box nicht
				mit mehr als fünf Anwendern gleichzeitig zu nutzen, das sich sonst die
				Rechenkapazität, die jedem Nutzer zu Verfügung steht, merklich verringert.
Sollten Sie, beispielsweise als Unternehmen, Interesse an einer differenzierten
				Rechteverwaltung haben, wenden Sie sich bitte an das pixx.io Team. Die pixx.io
				server Version bietet Ihnen eine breite Rechteverwaltung und zahlreiche weitere
				Features für Unternehmen.

Software

In welchen Sprachen steht pixx.io
				zur Verfügung?
Derzeit kann die pixx.io Benutzeroberfläche auf Deutsch und auf Englisch
				eingestellt werden. Zukünftig sind aber noch weitere Sprachversionen (z.B.:
				Spanisch, Französisch und Finnisch) geplant. Mit einem einfachen Software-Update
				können diese dann einfach nachinstalliert werden.
Das Benutzerhandbuch und Support-Videos werden auch zukünftig nur auf Deutsch
				und Englisch zur Verfügung gestellt werden.

Welche Dateiformate kann ich mit
				pixx.io verwalten?
Grundsätzlich können mit pixx.io fast alle Dateiformate verwaltet werden.
				pixx.io ist jedoch auf die Verarbeitung von Bild- und Grafikdateien optimiert.
				Deshalb gibt es einige Funktionen, z.B. das Einfügen von Wasserzeichen, oder
				verschiedene Filter, die nur mit Bilddateien (jpg, png, gif, psd, idd, etc.)
				durchgeführt werden können.

Muss ich zusätzliche Software
				installieren, um pixx.io zu verwenden?
Nein. pixx.io funktioniert auf jedem Endgerät mit Internetbrowser (Internet
				Explorer, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.), also z.B. auf jedem PC, Mac, Laptop oder
				Tablet.

Brauche ich ein
				spezielles Betriebssystem um pixx.io zu nutzen?
Nein. Sie können pixx.io mit jedem Betriebssystem
				verwenden. Es funktioniert mit Microsoft und Apple Betriebssystemen genauso gut,
				wie mit Linux oder Android. Einzige Voraussetzung: Das Betriebssystem muss in der
				Lage sein einen Browser (z.B. Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
				auszuführen


Mit welchem Browser kann ich pixx.io
				verwenden?
pixx.io ist multibrowserfähig. Das heißt, dass pixx.io mit allen gängigen
				Browsern betrieben werden kann. Dazu zählen beispielsweise Google Chrome, Firefox,
				Internet Explorer und Safari. pixx.io wird dabei immer auf die aktuellste Version
				der Browser optimiert.

Kann ich pixx.io
				mit meinem Tablet verwenden?
Ja. pixx.io ist optimiert auf die Verwendung mit Tablets, Laptops und Desktop
				Computern.
Kann ich
				pixx.io mit meinem Smartphone verwenden?
Ja. Es gibt eine mobile Version von pixx.io. Auf
				Grund der geringen Bildschirmgröße stehen hier aber nicht alle Funktionen zur
				Verfügung. Um optimal mit pixx.io arbeiten zu können, empfehlen wir die Verwendung
				mit Tablets, Laptops und Desktop Computern.

<h2><strong>Trinity Episcopal Church, located on the shore of Van Cleef Lake in Seneca Falls, NY (The Birthplace of Women’s Rights) needs financial assistance.</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Trinity recently completed a lengthy project repairing structural damage caused by years of erosion. The major portion of the damage was to the Bell Tower, which has been restored and the bell is once again ringing. The next major project was to be repair of the roof, which had been steadily deteriorating over the years. Following a micro burst, with winds in the range of 80 – 90 miles per hour, the roof suddenly became an emergency situation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During the service, one recent Sunday morning, there was a thunderstorm that demonstrated how dire the situation was. Water began leaking heavily in many areas of the roof, but the worst was directly above the recently restored pipe organ. Several quick acting parishioners managed to cover the organ with plastic to prevent any major damage.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>An estimated $300,000 is needed to completely replace the roof. Fortunately, a matching grant, in the amount of $150,000 was obtained. The Parish has $50,000 on hand to put toward the matching funds.  That means that Trinity needs to raise $100,000 to complete the match before the grant expires at the end of one year. </p>

</h3>
<p>It's a dream come true for every father to watch their son play a sport 
you once played and love to watch. It's even better when he plays it 
better than you! Our son <b>Jullian ""Juice"" Davis</b> is an exceptional 10 year 
old young man. In our house school comes first, in fact our children 
look at school as their ""job"", just like how Mommy and Daddy have jobs. 
Last year in the 4th grade he was recognized as an <b>honor roll student</b>, 
and this year he is headed in the same direction. Jullian excels in 
school and on the field. <br/></p>
<p>We started Jullian in football at age 5 and 
realized right away that he was gifted with a natural talent for the 
sport. His agility, speed, and comprehension of the game is virtually 
unmatched by others in his age group. In fact, he was the youngest kid 
to make it on the All Star team last year. <br/></p>
<p>As his coach and father we can
 sit down together and discuss offensive and defensive plays and 
formations. We watch college and professional football together every 
week in our Bears jerseys! When football season is over we keep busy 
with other sports and activities to stay in shape and keep his skills in
 check. We are a football family - Jullian plays, his sister Rayana does cheer,
 I coach, and Mom helps with team activities. This sport has kept our 
family together and given us many many great memories over the years.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Why We Need Your Help<br/>
</h3> <p>We are trying to get Ramon and Jullian to the AYF Nationals Championships in Kissimmee, Florida December 6th - the 12th. That means the boys need to travel over 2,800 miles!!!</p>
<p>Estimated costs are about $2,000 - this includes flights, rental car, food, hotel, and AYF dinner &amp; Universal Studios party. </p>
<p>This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for father and son. Of course the goal is to win it all, but even if we don't, this is a memory that cannot be duplicated. For that reason, we are asking for all of the help we can get.

<p>We have 2 kids that go to national competitions in the next 3 months.

We are teaching our kids life lessons about how to be positive contributors to our society.</p>
<p>We are trying to raise our kids honestly and we want them to be the best they can be. They need to have the chance to get out there and see the world and experience as much as possible. With your help, we can make it happen. It's like they say .. ""it takes a village"". </p>

It's a dream come true for every father to watch their son play a sport 
you once played and love to watch. It's even better when he plays it 
better than you! Our son Jullian ""Juice"" Davis is an exceptional 10 year 
old young man. In our house school comes first, in fact our children 
look at school as their ""job"", just like how Mommy and Daddy have jobs. 
Last year in the 4th grade he was recognized as an honor roll student, 
and this year he is headed in the same direction. Jullian excels in 
school and on the field. 
We started Jullian in football at age 5 and 
realized right away that he was gifted with a natural talent for the 
sport. His agility, speed, and comprehension of the game is virtually 
unmatched by others in his age group. In fact, he was the youngest kid 
to make it on the All Star team last year. 
As his coach and father we can
 sit down together and discuss offensive and defensive plays and 
formations. We watch college and professional football together every 
week in our Bears jerseys! When football season is over we keep busy 
with other sports and activities to stay in shape and keep his skills in
 check. We are a football family - Jullian plays, his sister Rayana does cheer,
 I coach, and Mom helps with team activities. This sport has kept our 
family together and given us many many great memories over the years.   Why We Need Your Help
 We are trying to get Ramon and Jullian to the AYF Nationals Championships in Kissimmee, Florida December 6th - the 12th. That means the boys need to travel over 2,800 miles!!!
Estimated costs are about $2,000 - this includes flights, rental car, food, hotel, and AYF dinner & Universal Studios party. 
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for father and son. Of course the goal is to win it all, but even if we don't, this is a memory that cannot be duplicated. For that reason, we are asking for all of the help we can get. We both work full time jobs as a window installer and an ortho tech, but live paycheck to paycheck to covering the expense of living in a safe town and having our kids in good schools. That's why WE NEED YOUR HELP!!! 
We have 2 kids that go to national competitions in the next 3 months. Jullian's is short notice because we had to see how the team was doing in order to qualify for nationals - Rayana's is in January, her cheer team is so awesome we know we are going to qualify every year ;-) So if we do not get all of the funds we need for Jullian in this short period of time we will use the funds to help Rayana's nationals trip to Las Vegas in January.
  The Impact Your contribution has the potential to go a long way. Jullian will be taught that our friends, family and fellow people have huge hearts.

What's this all about?

About a year ago, I was diagnosed with the Hashimoto syndrome, a thyroid malfunction that overproduces anti-chromosomal antibodies, which end up attacking your own thyroid. This illness can be contracted by several factors, including genetics. I got that one. Recently, we were able to make tests on my younger sister, discovering that she suffers this disease too, which doubled our medical expenses. Hashimoto syndrome, although has some mildly handicapping symptoms like chronic headaches and intense tiredness, is per-se not a serious illness, but it has no cure, and if left untreated it will carry dangerous consequences, like diabetes and thyroid cancer.The two of us have to be under constant medical supervision;monthly blood tests, ultrasounds, transport to the nearest city with the necessary equipment and medication for a life time with no hope for recovery have depleted our savings and have affected every other aspect of our life.We need help paying these bills until we can recover our economical stability, when my older sibling and I finish school and are able to get a full time job. But by then, every single dollar will be of great help and will make us extremely grateful.  :) Thank you so much for taking your time to read this, and please excuse my English
   What do we need the money for?  
Transport; we don't have a car, and the nearest medical facility with prepared to treat us is 4 hours away 
Medication; I have to take synthetic thyroxine every day of my life, I also have to take selenium three times a week. My little sister hasnt been able to start taking medication yet, and with the money we will be able to get her to do so.

These also help to keep under control any anomaly (liek cysts) and treat cancer early if it presents itself.




But 1,600 doesn't seem that troublesome?
You are right, in american economy, 1,600 dollars might not be too much, but here in mexico, it can be quite a huge amount, specially if a family's (e.g: ours) income barely ascend to 350 usd monthly, everyone's salary combined.

<p>Over the years, the Aurai team has been devoted to find the best solution for digital eye strain. With the soaring popularity of digital devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops spreading around the globe, we spend more time looking at screens than ever. The side effects of extended screen time include eye fatigue,  dry eyes, and blurred vision. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After years of development, we finally came up with a breakthrough solution - Aurai, water-propelled eye massager dedicated to relief eye fatigue and eye discomfort.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Following the remarkable success of our first model on crowd-funding campagin, we're coming back with our second project - Rio. Rio primarily focuses on enhancing the functionality and user experience of warm compression on eyes, making it more compact and portable, more comfortable to wear, and most importantly, more accessible and affordable for everyone.  </p>

<p><strong>Did you know... </strong></p>
<p>Average Americans spent about 10 hours and 39 minutes a day staring at their digital devices.  </p>
<p>Since many of our hobbies and activities are increasingly online, we inevitably spend more time on screens no matter if we are working or entertaining. According to the 2016 Digital Eye Strain Report by the Vision Council, almost 9 out of 10 Americans use digital devices for two or more hours each day. Nearly 60% of Americans use digital devices for five or more hours daily, and 70% of people use two or more devices simultaneously.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>From 2012 to 2018, we've increased time spent on mobile media by 130%, and digital eye strain has become more common in modern lives.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>All of these findings clearly tell us that we've taken a toll on our eyes. The more time we spend on screens, the more easily our eyes get fatigued which will lead to dry eyes, irritated eyes, blurred vision, related headaches, and poor sleep. These in turn will negatively affect our work and quality of life. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>This is exactly where Rio comes in. </i></p>

<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/lNQZ7BCgqWOMl8Df58/giphy.gif"" src=""""/><p>Rio achieves water permeability and maintains adequate moisture around eyes without irritation. Whether you had a late night out or have been staring at a screen for hours at work, your strained dry eyes and skin around your eye sockets are worth being moisturized by Rio.</p>

<p>Rio utilizes water circulation and simulated wave pulses to relax muscle tension gently around the eye area while limiting noise to promote relaxation. With its unique water circulation system, Rio literally soothes your eye strain in the most comfortable way. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>While other eye massagers utilize rigid vibration, Rio reduces your eye strain without creating any uncomfortable or harmful vibrations. The tender massage provided by Rio will improve your blood circulation and boost metabolism, allowing you to get rid of the eye fatigue cumulated over a day. Just close your eyes and let Rio cradle you to deep relaxation. </p>

<p>The built-in constant temperature system ensures the temperature stays within the designated range, saving you from hassles in replacing hot towels/gel packs. Dual phase temperature offers optional temperature ranges: Normal 39 – 41°C (102 - 105°F) and High 42 – 44°C (107 - 111°F) to suit different user’s liking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Whether you need a light rest during a coffee break or seek a deep relaxation after you’ve had a long, tough day, you’ll always find an ideal temperature for yourself. The high temperature setting works especially well to encourage oil gland production, so your eyes produce more tears to mitigate dry eye discomfort.</p>

<p>We know how delicate and important your eyes are. Traditional eye massagers use a rigid approach with squeezing air compression bags or rolling mechanical metal tips. Rio takes good care of your eyes with a soft, gentle, and skin-friendly eye mask. It's made of medical grade silicone, it's hypo-allergenic, and it's easy to clean and maintain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ergonomically designed water bag comfortably molds to your eye sockets, allowing temperature to naturally come through to your skin. Water circulates inside the silicone eye mask along with vibration modules, generating wave-like movements that tenderly massage around your eyes.    </p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Over the years, the Aurai team has been devoted to find the best solution for digital eye strain. With the soaring popularity of digital devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops spreading around the globe, we spend more time looking at screens than ever. The side effects of extended screen time include eye fatigue,  dry eyes, and blurred vision. 
 
After years of development, we finally came up with a breakthrough solution - Aurai, water-propelled eye massager dedicated to relief eye fatigue and eye discomfort.
 
Following the remarkable success of our first model on crowd-funding campagin, we're coming back with our second project - Rio. Rio primarily focuses on enhancing the functionality and user experience of warm compression on eyes, making it more compact and portable, more comfortable to wear, and most importantly, more accessible and affordable for everyone.  

 
 

 
 
 

Did you know... 
Average Americans spent about 10 hours and 39 minutes a day staring at their digital devices.  
Since many of our hobbies and activities are increasingly online, we inevitably spend more time on screens no matter if we are working or entertaining. According to the 2016 Digital Eye Strain Report by the Vision Council, almost 9 out of 10 Americans use digital devices for two or more hours each day. Nearly 60% of Americans use digital devices for five or more hours daily, and 70% of people use two or more devices simultaneously.   
 
From 2012 to 2018, we've increased time spent on mobile media by 130%, and digital eye strain has become more common in modern lives.   
 
All of these findings clearly tell us that we've taken a toll on our eyes. The more time we spend on screens, the more easily our eyes get fatigued which will lead to dry eyes, irritated eyes, blurred vision, related headaches, and poor sleep. These in turn will negatively affect our work and quality of life. 
 
This is exactly where Rio comes in. 
 
 
 

 

Rio achieves water permeability and maintains adequate moisture around eyes without irritation. Whether you had a late night out or have been staring at a screen for hours at work, your strained dry eyes and skin around your eye sockets are worth being moisturized by Rio.
 
 
 

  
Rio utilizes water circulation and simulated wave pulses to relax muscle tension gently around the eye area while limiting noise to promote relaxation. With its unique water circulation system, Rio literally soothes your eye strain in the most comfortable way. 
 
While other eye massagers utilize rigid vibration, Rio reduces your eye strain without creating any uncomfortable or harmful vibrations. The tender massage provided by Rio will improve your blood circulation and boost metabolism, allowing you to get rid of the eye fatigue cumulated over a day. Just close your eyes and let Rio cradle you to deep relaxation. 
 
 
 

  

The built-in constant temperature system ensures the temperature stays within the designated range, saving you from hassles in replacing hot towels/gel packs. Dual phase temperature offers optional temperature ranges: Normal 39 – 41°C (102 - 105°F) and High 42 – 44°C (107 - 111°F) to suit different user’s liking.
 
Whether you need a light rest during a coffee break or seek a deep relaxation after you’ve had a long, tough day, you’ll always find an ideal temperature for yourself. The high temperature setting works especially well to encourage oil gland production, so your eyes produce more tears to mitigate dry eye discomfort.
 
 
 

  
We know how delicate and important your eyes are. Traditional eye massagers use a rigid approach with squeezing air compression bags or rolling mechanical metal tips. Rio takes good care of your eyes with a soft, gentle, and skin-friendly eye mask. It's made of medical grade silicone, it's hypo-allergenic, and it's easy to clean and maintain.
 
The ergonomically designed water bag comfortably molds to your eye sockets, allowing temperature to naturally come through to your skin. Water circulates inside the silicone eye mask along with vibration modules, generating wave-like movements that tenderly massage around your eyes.    
 
 
 

  
We’ve successfully shrunk Rio's size from the previous model, making it more compact, lighter, and more portable, so Rio can travel wherever you go. Rio is powered through a micro-USB connection, one of the most widely used connectors in the market.
 
Other than the AC adapter provided, Rio also works with other power banks or external battery packs with rated output 5v=~2A. As long as you bring the micro-USB cable provided, you'll easily find applicable power sources.

 “I feel like my eye really open up and I feel my view is wider now.” 
 

""I was thinking of would be nice to use it everyday!""
 

""Once you glued and put you sleep! It actually feel good now, my eyes are rested. ""

que desistir ya que tras 50 días hablando con infinidad de empresas, ninguna ha
querido ayudar. Mi única opción es conseguir un costoso billete de avión. Con
el exceso de peso y la bicicleta no bajará de los 1200€.<span></span>
</div></li>
<li><div align=""justify"">
<span><span>Necesito </span></span>dos neumáticos Schwalbe Marathon Mondiale
(55,90€ Und) para que las ruedas aguanten todo el viaje por África, más los
gastos de envío desde Holanda (35€) ya
que estos neumáticos no se encuentran en Sudáfrica. Estas cubiertas son vitales
ya que son de muy alta resistencia y las actuales están destrozadas.<br/>
</div></li>
<li>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span><span></span></span> Debo cambiar la cadena, el sistema de piñones
trasero y repuestos básicos (100€) (pastillas de frenos, cableado, radios,
parches, aceite, cámaras…etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span><span></span></span>Siempre busco el
calzado más cómodo para pedalear pero que también lo sea para caminar. Tengo
unas botas que me siguen desde hace un año, juntos hemos escalado montañas y
volcanes, cruzado desiertos, selvas, ríos, lagos y bosques por todo América,
pero necesito un reemplazo que me ayude a cruzar África.</p></li>

llamo Javier Colorado, soy español y llevo dando la vuelta al mundo en
bicicleta desde hace 26 meses, durante los cuales he pedaleado 47.600
kilómetros por 34 países de 3 continentes www.coloradoontheroad.com.
Los 6 últimos meses he pedaleado 9.000 kilómetros por 4 países, viajando sin
dinero y viviendo de la ayuda. Ya he concluido el viaje por mi tercer
continente y el último que me queda es África. 
Ruta
llevada acabo hasta la fecha:
Aunque
parezca una cosa de locos, se que podré cruzar África sin apenas recursos
económicos, pero hay ciertos aspectos técnicos que necesito de vuestra ayuda
para hacer realidad:


 Después de buscar y buscar un barco que me
llevara a surcar el Océano Atlántico desde Brasil hasta Sudáfrica, he tenido
que desistir ya que tras 50 días hablando con infinidad de empresas, ninguna ha
querido ayudar. Mi única opción es conseguir un costoso billete de avión. Con
el exceso de peso y la bicicleta no bajará de los 1200€.


Necesito dos neumáticos Schwalbe Marathon Mondiale
(55,90€ Und) para que las ruedas aguanten todo el viaje por África, más los
gastos de envío desde Holanda (35€) ya
que estos neumáticos no se encuentran en Sudáfrica. Estas cubiertas son vitales
ya que son de muy alta resistencia y las actuales están destrozadas.


 Debo cambiar la cadena, el sistema de piñones
trasero y repuestos básicos (100€) (pastillas de frenos, cableado, radios,
parches, aceite, cámaras…etc.)

Siempre busco el
calzado más cómodo para pedalear pero que también lo sea para caminar. Tengo
unas botas que me siguen desde hace un año, juntos hemos escalado montañas y
volcanes, cruzado desiertos, selvas, ríos, lagos y bosques por todo América,
pero necesito un reemplazo que me ayude a cruzar África.
(Unas botas con muchas historias y la rueda lisa con el Kevlar verde al descubierto)

En definitiva, ponerme en África con Bucéfalo (nombre de mi
bicicleta) en condiciones de aguantar 12.000 Km y yo me la cruzo de Sur a Norte! Seguiré documentando todo el viaje con fotografías, vídeos, entradas en mi blog y mi página web, para compartirlo a través de todas mis redes sociales (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Vimeo y Wordpress)


Resumen de la ayuda necesaria para continuar el proyecto:
                                   
PayPal
me aplica un 3,4% de comisión en cada donación que recibo en mi proyecto. Todo
el presupuesto necesario asciende a los 1526,8 €
y con la comisión de PayPal en 1580,5 €.

<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
<p>Iboga Care's mission is to contribute to the greater availability and affordability of Tabernanthe Iboga for therapeutic use by creating a non profit organic and sustainable iboga farm in Costa Rica. Iboga Care's intent is to donate the harvest for the treatment of addictions and various other physical, mental, and spiritual imbalances. In the process we hope to encourage more people to sustainably cultivate iboga worldwide.<br/></p>

<p>If you have never heard of iboga, it is one of the most powerful medicinal, detox and spiritual exploration plants in the world. Iboga is known as the Grandfather or King of plant medicines. Tabernanthe Iboga is a small tree that grows in the jungles of Central West Africa. For thousands of years it has been used as  a sacred ceremonial sacrament in Cameroon, Gabon, and Congo. The word iboga comes from a verb in the Tsogo language, “boghaga,” meaning “to care for or to heal”.  Practitioners of the  Bwiti religion regard this as the ultimate sacrament, the “Holy Wood.” Iboga is often referred to as the Tree of Life and the experience and its effects are very unique among other plant medicines.<br/></p>

<b>1. Iboga is a revolutionary approach to addiction treatment</b><br/>In the rest of the world it is famous for it's active alkaloid ibogaine, which to date, is the most powerful addiction interrupter known. It is typical that after one flood dose, the patient “awakens” 24 hours later with complete remission from their addiction. Thomas Kingsley Brown in his study Ibogaine in the Treatment of Substance Dependence, reports that ""32 of 33 IV heroin users showed no signs or only very mild symptoms of opiate withdrawal 72 hours after being treated.""  It is said that iboga/ibogaine has a 60-90% success rate while traditional 12 step programs have a 8-10% success rate. The numbers from a study on traditional 30 day alcohol rehab treatment center costing an average of $30,000 reports of 299 alcoholics treated at six different centers, one year later indicated:<br/> <br/><ul>
<li>82% resumed drinking</li>
<li>of the 55 that remained abstinent:</li>
<li>54% were overtly disturbed and unstable;</li>
<li>24% had no sense of excitement or interest in life;</li>
<li>12% replaced addiction with AA or a new purpose and</li>
<li>10% were independent successes  -from hrc@healthrecovery.com</li>
</ul>Americans consume 80% of opiate painkillers produced in the world. More than 17,000 Americans die each year from accidental overdose of painkillers—more than from heroin, cocaine and all other illegal drugs combined. Calling it an epidemic, the CDC reports that women's deaths from painkillers has risen 400% in just 10 years. Tragically, every hour, a baby is born in the United States with symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Iboga/ibogaine has been used to successfully treat prescription painkiller addiction. <br/><br/> Most of us have been touched in some way by these maladies. Many people have been in and out of rehab all their lives and are still suffering. Many of us have lost someone we know, a loved one or a family member, and have wondered if there was more that we could have done. Iboga/ibogaine seems to create a path out of this hopelessness. It  is far more successful than most, if not all traditional treatment options. With other psychoactive medicines, the experience is over when the psychoactive is thrown out of the system and most often people goes back to the same problems that they were trying to heal. Ibogaine is unique where it can stay in your system for months to give you further insights, communication, and prolongs your ability to remain free from addictions, sometimes for many years after just one dose. Ibogaine is not a 'magic bullet', therefore aftercare is recommended in achieving lifelong freedom from addictions.    <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/864646/files/20140917135916-10513252_1532554666966025_5179203919592813829_n.jpg?1410987556"" src="""" style=""width: 518.082px; height: 465px;""/></p>
<b>2. Iboga is a revolutionary treatment approach for many mental disorders</b><br/>From the Shamanic View of Mental Illness by by Stephanie Marohn (featuring Malidoma Patrice Somé):<br/><br/><i>""A common thread that Dr. Somé has noticed in “mental” disorders in the West is “a very ancient ancestral energy that has been placed in stasis, that finally is coming out in the person.”...thus, mental disorders are spiritual emergencies, spiritual crises, and need to be regarded as such to aid the healer in being born...""if these ancestors are not healed, their sick energy will haunt the souls and psyches of those who are responsible for helping them.”...in indigenous cultures all over the world, young people are initiated into adulthood when they reach a certain age.  The lack of such initiation in the West is part of the crisis that people are in here, says Dr. Somé.  He urges communities to bring together “the creative juices of people who have had this kind of experience, in an attempt to come up with some kind of an alternative ritual that would at least begin to put a dent in this kind of crisis.”</i><br/><br/>Iboga is used to treat PTSD, depression, anxiety, ADHD, dementia, Alzheimer’s and many numerous other mental, emotional, spiritual and physical disorders. Iboga cleans the mind of it’s unwanted and limiting negative programming, restoring you to the clarity of your pre-trauma or pre-addictive state. A complete mind, body, spirit ‘reset’ is often described. It can eliminate the initial emotional pain that may have caused you to seek painkillers, alcohol, sleeping pills, anti-depressants or other hard drugs. Your emotional body is temporarily relieved so that you can witness and process past traumas in a near-instant without getting caught up in old triggers and fears. Some say that taking journeys with other plants medicines for ten years would not be equal to one Iboga journey. <i>""Iboga took me away from a cycle of self (and my loved ones) destruction. It gave me the chance to reset my existence as a human being.""  </i>Anonymous, TheIbogaineDossier.com.<br/><br/>Ibogaine has been found to increase levels of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, or GDNF, which promotes the survival and replenishment of many types of neurons. A single dose of ibogaine can increase GDNF expression for weeks, depending on dosage. Ibogaine is also highly lipophilic and remains in body fat for months, gradually being released, further extending its influence on GDNF expression.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/864626/files/20140917135158-IBOGAfloating_in_a_dream_by_Claudiu_Popescu.gif?1410987118"" src="""" style=""width: 538.53px; height: 358px;""/></p> Dr Carl Anderson and colleagues at Harvard Medical School and the Brain Imaging Center at McLean Hospital, Virginia, speculated that addiction is related to a disrupted relationship between the brain's two hemispheres, and that ibogaine may cause ""bihemispheric reintegration"". Ibogaine breaks the habitual cognitive-emotional patterns of drug addiction by resetting the vermis networks and restoring a more normal pre-abuse neural organization. Treatment with Ibogaine is a viable method of resetting the brain and freeing one’s dependance on trauma induced behavioral patters. Ibogaine, with it’s hemispheric reintegration, may potentially free the minds of many individuals (addicts, rape victims, violent criminals, victims of child abuse, war or natural disasters) suffering from the debilitating emotional disregulation resulting from hemispheric disharmony. Ibogaine works through multiple neurotransmitter systems to create a state of plasticity, similar to states of plasticity existing during fetal development. This critical brain state may facilitate the consolidation of traumatic memories, reversal of abnormal hemispheric functional and the dissolution of habitual motor patterns associated with addiction. -Excerpts from the study, Ibogaine Therapy and the Fractal Nature of Fetal REM Sleep and Interhemispheric Reintegration, nature.com<br/><br/><i>""I’m a 47 year old male. Up until about 8 months ago I was wishing to die and having daily bouts with suicidal thoughts. Since my mid 20s I’ve been trying to fix this internal memory that’s been trying to take control of my life...when I read that it reboots both the body and the mind to pre-trauma state, I said to myself, out loud, “Oh my God, this will fix me.” My life time battle with an internal childhood molestation memory was cured with a single Ibogaine treatment."" </i>-Dave Costarella, dcandco.net/ibo.htm<br/><br/><b>3. Iboga is a revolutionary approach to spiritual exploration </b><br/>Iboga is not a drug nor entertainment. It is deeply spiritual and healing.  Being a root medicine, iboga works directly at the roots of our center 
to heal a myriad of physical and mental traumas, addictions and is 
perhaps an unparalleled means to do so.<br/><br/><i> ""When solving problems, dig at the roots instead of just hacking at the leaves.""</i><br/>-Anthony J. D'Angelo <br/><br/>Iboga is about going inward and deeper, accessing the infinite nature of the soul. The sheer volume of information received during an iboga experience is unrivaled and part of what makes iboga an incredibly powerful spiritual tool. Iboga seems to ‘eliminate’ what is hindering a person’s ability to experience freedom or free will. It can awaken one to their true spiritual nature. <i>""Ibogaine was a mental process for me, a form of spiritual purification and a truth serum in which I had to experience its results through time."" </i>-Anonymous from TheIbogaineDossier.com<br/><br/>Iboga as been reported to decalcify the pineal gland and is a third eye activator. Iboga teaches through direct, logical information and holographic visions. There is no translation issue as sometimes experienced with other plant medicines. People have called Iboga your ‘stern father’ and exposes your subconsciousness to truth. For most it offers a period of amazing clarity lasting 3-4 months and has been reported to remain present 8 years or more after one session. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/842854/files/20140908110458-lucid-dream.gif?1410199498"" src="""" style=""width: 530.027px; height: 411px;""/></p>
<p>Iboga is used as a right of passage and awakens one to their true spiritual nature. Many people report having a ‘life review’ from your own database of memories and can ask any questions and receive answers from a telepathic voice of truth. The Iboga visions can last 15-24+ hours. <i>“My experience with iboga gave me what I was trying to achieve in 20 years of meditation, mental clarity and profound instant insights.”</i> Anonymous from an IbogaCare fan. While iboga has varied physical and mental benefits, its bases as a medicine has always been about spiritual exploration. People's experiences are very diverse and if you would like to know more, there are many testimonials online. <br/></p>
<p><b>4. Iboga is a revolutionary approach to detoxification and disease treatment</b><br/>Iboga is also considered an extremely powerful detox tool. It reportedly raises the body’s frequency and removes pesticides, mercury and aluminum from the muscles and blood, and kills off parasites, candida, viruses and other low-vibration microorganisms (It is well documented that physical parasites and fungus have mind control abilities). Ibogaine has been proven to put Hepatitis C into remission. Another powerful detox benefit of Iboga it contains an alkaloid that been shown to significantly reduce viral loads in the body including HIV. Please refer to the above info graphic for more information. <br/></p>
<p><b>Why Iboga Care</b>?<br/></p>
<p></p>

A typical treatment costs an average of $5000, while considerably less than the cost of rehab, is still out of reach for many people suffering, and access can be difficult and expensive due to 
traveling outside of the countries where it is illegal for treatment. 
Currently iboga is becoming more and more scarce in the wild and the demand 
is increasing. The iboga tree in the wild is under intense ecological 
pressure. Estimates say 
that wild Iboga is disappearing at an alarming rate. We need more of these amazing small trees all over the
 planet, so that 
all who desperately need access may one day find a way to be treated, while not further negatively impacting Africa's ecology. 
<br/><br/>For some people
 with addictions and other health disorders, iboga is a miracle. To ensure greater access and affordability we need to take
 action now. The iboga 
tree takes about 5 years to mature, with the most desirable root bark 
being 10 or more years old.  Some plantations have been created, but demand is far greater than supply and availability. That means it is incredibly important to 
sustainably propagate more trees right now. We see a future where iboga trees are 
plentiful and people have more affordable and effective treatment 
options, whereas previously there was only hopelessness.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/843066/files/20140908123350-IBOGAlucid-dreaming-mask.gif?1410204830"" src="""" style=""width: 534px; height: 356px;""/></p>Iboga Care is asking you to help us create a sustainable and organic iboga farm in Costa Rica. Costa Rica is an ideal location because Iboga grows best in tropical environments.  If we are successful in this cultivation, in 4-6 years the rootbark would be sustainably harvested. The intent of this project is about giving, not profitability. It is our goal to donate 100% of the root bark to those who need it but otherwise cannot afford it. This means that we would work with qualified providers who can professionally administer it at a reduced cost, or for free, to lower income patients.  We do not intend to open our own treatment facility. These funds will also go to exploring the possibility of Iboga Care as a non profit. Iboga Care will be giving 5% of the funds, after fees and expenses, raised during our indiegogo 
campaign to Gabon to help them in their efforts to create sustainable 
iboga plantations in their country.  <br/><br/>Iboga Care's idea of giving was born 20 years ago, in the spirit and heart of the ancient gift giving practices Bart learned while living with the Hopi. <i><br/></i>
<blockquote><p><i>""Bart wanted to spend three months on the Hopi reservation to film the 
dying language of the Hopi tribe, and he needed $4000 in 16mm film stock
 to make this dream a reality. I decided then and there to start a grant
 program in honor of my father, Roy W. Dean, film philanthropist 
extraordinaire! I gave Bart the film, and the Roy W. Dean film grants 
were born. In the true spirit of “Pay 
it Forward,” after spending two years living on the Hopi reservation, 
Bart completed his film HOPILAVAYI, and offered his film and all film rights to the 
Hopi Nation. In appreciation for the film and its message, Brooks 
Institute of Photography offered a full scholarship to a Hopi student. 
Bart’s insight, boldness, and sensitivity caught the attention of the 
film industry, which awarded him the coveted CINE Golden Eagle Award, 
and the Townsend Tenacity Award. HOPILAVAYI was shown at the Directors Guild of America and was in national and 
international film festivals."" </i>Carole Dean, From The Heart Productions. <br/></p></blockquote>
<p>Lets work together to help create freedom from addiction and spiritual 
illnesses through the care, 
giving, and profound healing that iboga offers humanity. Help Iboga Care
 spread the
 word for this incredible opportunity to sustainably grow iboga and 
encourage interested people all over the world to join in as growers. 
The gifts you give to Iboga Care, will allow us to freely give the iboga
 root bark and its life changing gifts to people in need. Join us in 
making this beautiful dream a reality! Help us to start this iboga farm 
right now and encourage others to do the same all over the globe. Bring 
hope and options to those suffering from PTSD, addiction, and so many 
more mental, emotional, spiritual and physical disorders. Check out our 
great perks from our wonderful and generous partners.  Know that any 
gift you can give to Iboga Care's campaign is deeply appreciated and 
will continue to generate more gifts in return. Please visit our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ibogacare"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook</a> page and <a href=""http://ibogacare.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">IbogaCare.com </a>to learn more about our iboga projects. <br/></p>
<p>There are a small handful of countries in the world where iboga and ibogaine 
treatments are illegal. Unfortunately, the United States is one of them.
 Luckily, there are excellent treatment facilities in Canada, Mexico and
 Costa Rica, as well as many other countries.

Iboga Care's mission is to contribute to the greater availability and affordability of Tabernanthe Iboga for therapeutic use by creating a non profit organic and sustainable iboga farm in Costa Rica. Iboga Care's intent is to donate the harvest for the treatment of addictions and various other physical, mental, and spiritual imbalances. In the process we hope to encourage more people to sustainably cultivate iboga worldwide.

Why An Iboga Revolution?




If you have never heard of iboga, it is one of the most powerful medicinal, detox and spiritual exploration plants in the world. Iboga is known as the Grandfather or King of plant medicines. Tabernanthe Iboga is a small tree that grows in the jungles of Central West Africa. For thousands of years it has been used as  a sacred ceremonial sacrament in Cameroon, Gabon, and Congo. The word iboga comes from a verb in the Tsogo language, “boghaga,” meaning “to care for or to heal”.  Practitioners of the  Bwiti religion regard this as the ultimate sacrament, the “Holy Wood.” Iboga is often referred to as the Tree of Life and the experience and its effects are very unique among other plant medicines.







1. Iboga is a revolutionary approach to addiction treatmentIn the rest of the world it is famous for it's active alkaloid ibogaine, which to date, is the most powerful addiction interrupter known. It is typical that after one flood dose, the patient “awakens” 24 hours later with complete remission from their addiction. Thomas Kingsley Brown in his study Ibogaine in the Treatment of Substance Dependence, reports that ""32 of 33 IV heroin users showed no signs or only very mild symptoms of opiate withdrawal 72 hours after being treated.""  It is said that iboga/ibogaine has a 60-90% success rate while traditional 12 step programs have a 8-10% success rate. The numbers from a study on traditional 30 day alcohol rehab treatment center costing an average of $30,000 reports of 299 alcoholics treated at six different centers, one year later indicated: 
82% resumed drinking
of the 55 that remained abstinent:
54% were overtly disturbed and unstable;
24% had no sense of excitement or interest in life;
12% replaced addiction with AA or a new purpose and
10% were independent successes  -from hrc@healthrecovery.com
Americans consume 80% of opiate painkillers produced in the world. More than 17,000 Americans die each year from accidental overdose of painkillers—more than from heroin, cocaine and all other illegal drugs combined. Calling it an epidemic, the CDC reports that women's deaths from painkillers has risen 400% in just 10 years. Tragically, every hour, a baby is born in the United States with symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Iboga/ibogaine has been used to successfully treat prescription painkiller addiction.  Most of us have been touched in some way by these maladies. Many people have been in and out of rehab all their lives and are still suffering. Many of us have lost someone we know, a loved one or a family member, and have wondered if there was more that we could have done. Iboga/ibogaine seems to create a path out of this hopelessness. It  is far more successful than most, if not all traditional treatment options. With other psychoactive medicines, the experience is over when the psychoactive is thrown out of the system and most often people goes back to the same problems that they were trying to heal. Ibogaine is unique where it can stay in your system for months to give you further insights, communication, and prolongs your ability to remain free from addictions, sometimes for many years after just one dose. Ibogaine is not a 'magic bullet', therefore aftercare is recommended in achieving lifelong freedom from addictions.    
2. Iboga is a revolutionary treatment approach for many mental disordersFrom the Shamanic View of Mental Illness by by Stephanie Marohn (featuring Malidoma Patrice Somé):""A common thread that Dr. Somé has noticed in “mental” disorders in the West is “a very ancient ancestral energy that has been placed in stasis, that finally is coming out in the person.”...thus, mental disorders are spiritual emergencies, spiritual crises, and need to be regarded as such to aid the healer in being born...""if these ancestors are not healed, their sick energy will haunt the souls and psyches of those who are responsible for helping them.”...in indigenous cultures all over the world, young people are initiated into adulthood when they reach a certain age.  The lack of such initiation in the West is part of the crisis that people are in here, says Dr. Somé.  He urges communities to bring together “the creative juices of people who have had this kind of experience, in an attempt to come up with some kind of an alternative ritual that would at least begin to put a dent in this kind of crisis.”Iboga is used to treat PTSD, depression, anxiety, ADHD, dementia, Alzheimer’s and many numerous other mental, emotional, spiritual and physical disorders. Iboga cleans the mind of it’s unwanted and limiting negative programming, restoring you to the clarity of your pre-trauma or pre-addictive state. A complete mind, body, spirit ‘reset’ is often described. It can eliminate the initial emotional pain that may have caused you to seek painkillers, alcohol, sleeping pills, anti-depressants or other hard drugs. Your emotional body is temporarily relieved so that you can witness and process past traumas in a near-instant without getting caught up in old triggers and fears. Some say that taking journeys with other plants medicines for ten years would not be equal to one Iboga journey. ""Iboga took me away from a cycle of self (and my loved ones) destruction. It gave me the chance to reset my existence as a human being.""  Anonymous, TheIbogaineDossier.com.Ibogaine has been found to increase levels of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, or GDNF, which promotes the survival and replenishment of many types of neurons. A single dose of ibogaine can increase GDNF expression for weeks, depending on dosage. Ibogaine is also highly lipophilic and remains in body fat for months, gradually being released, further extending its influence on GDNF expression. Dr Carl Anderson and colleagues at Harvard Medical School and the Brain Imaging Center at McLean Hospital, Virginia, speculated that addiction is related to a disrupted relationship between the brain's two hemispheres, and that ibogaine may cause ""bihemispheric reintegration"". Ibogaine breaks the habitual cognitive-emotional patterns of drug addiction by resetting the vermis networks and restoring a more normal pre-abuse neural organization. Treatment with Ibogaine is a viable method of resetting the brain and freeing one’s dependance on trauma induced behavioral patters. Ibogaine, with it’s hemispheric reintegration, may potentially free the minds of many individuals (addicts, rape victims, violent criminals, victims of child abuse, war or natural disasters) suffering from the debilitating emotional disregulation resulting from hemispheric disharmony. Ibogaine works through multiple neurotransmitter systems to create a state of plasticity, similar to states of plasticity existing during fetal development. This critical brain state may facilitate the consolidation of traumatic memories, reversal of abnormal hemispheric functional and the dissolution of habitual motor patterns associated with addiction. -Excerpts from the study, Ibogaine Therapy and the Fractal Nature of Fetal REM Sleep and Interhemispheric Reintegration, nature.com""I’m a 47 year old male. Up until about 8 months ago I was wishing to die and having daily bouts with suicidal thoughts. Since my mid 20s I’ve been trying to fix this internal memory that’s been trying to take control of my life...when I read that it reboots both the body and the mind to pre-trauma state, I said to myself, out loud, “Oh my God, this will fix me.” My life time battle with an internal childhood molestation memory was cured with a single Ibogaine treatment."" -Dave Costarella, dcandco.net/ibo.htm3. Iboga is a revolutionary approach to spiritual exploration Iboga is not a drug nor entertainment. It is deeply spiritual and healing.  Being a root medicine, iboga works directly at the roots of our center 
to heal a myriad of physical and mental traumas, addictions and is 
perhaps an unparalleled means to do so. ""When solving problems, dig at the roots instead of just hacking at the leaves.""-Anthony J. D'Angelo Iboga is about going inward and deeper, accessing the infinite nature of the soul. The sheer volume of information received during an iboga experience is unrivaled and part of what makes iboga an incredibly powerful spiritual tool. Iboga seems to ‘eliminate’ what is hindering a person’s ability to experience freedom or free will. It can awaken one to their true spiritual nature. ""Ibogaine was a mental process for me, a form of spiritual purification and a truth serum in which I had to experience its results through time."" -Anonymous from TheIbogaineDossier.comIboga as been reported to decalcify the pineal gland and is a third eye activator. Iboga teaches through direct, logical information and holographic visions. There is no translation issue as sometimes experienced with other plant medicines. People have called Iboga your ‘stern father’ and exposes your subconsciousness to truth. For most it offers a period of amazing clarity lasting 3-4 months and has been reported to remain present 8 years or more after one session. 
Iboga is used as a right of passage and awakens one to their true spiritual nature. Many people report having a ‘life review’ from your own database of memories and can ask any questions and receive answers from a telepathic voice of truth. The Iboga visions can last 15-24+ hours. “My experience with iboga gave me what I was trying to achieve in 20 years of meditation, mental clarity and profound instant insights.” Anonymous from an IbogaCare fan. While iboga has varied physical and mental benefits, its bases as a medicine has always been about spiritual exploration. People's experiences are very diverse and if you would like to know more, there are many testimonials online. 
4. Iboga is a revolutionary approach to detoxification and disease treatmentIboga is also considered an extremely powerful detox tool. It reportedly raises the body’s frequency and removes pesticides, mercury and aluminum from the muscles and blood, and kills off parasites, candida, viruses and other low-vibration microorganisms (It is well documented that physical parasites and fungus have mind control abilities). Ibogaine has been proven to put Hepatitis C into remission. Another powerful detox benefit of Iboga it contains an alkaloid that been shown to significantly reduce viral loads in the body including HIV. Please refer to the above info graphic for more information. 
Why Iboga Care?


A typical treatment costs an average of $5000, while considerably less than the cost of rehab, is still out of reach for many people suffering, and access can be difficult and expensive due to 
traveling outside of the countries where it is illegal for treatment. 
Currently iboga is becoming more and more scarce in the wild and the demand 
is increasing. The iboga tree in the wild is under intense ecological 
pressure. Estimates say 
that wild Iboga is disappearing at an alarming rate. We need more of these amazing small trees all over the
 planet, so that 
all who desperately need access may one day find a way to be treated, while not further negatively impacting Africa's ecology. 
For some people
 with addictions and other health disorders, iboga is a miracle. To ensure greater access and affordability we need to take
 action now. The iboga 
tree takes about 5 years to mature, with the most desirable root bark 
being 10 or more years old.  Some plantations have been created, but demand is far greater than supply and availability. That means it is incredibly important to 
sustainably propagate more trees right now. We see a future where iboga trees are 
plentiful and people have more affordable and effective treatment 
options, whereas previously there was only hopelessness.Iboga Care is asking you to help us create a sustainable and organic iboga farm in Costa Rica. Costa Rica is an ideal location because Iboga grows best in tropical environments.  If we are successful in this cultivation, in 4-6 years the rootbark would be sustainably harvested. The intent of this project is about giving, not profitability. It is our goal to donate 100% of the root bark to those who need it but otherwise cannot afford it. This means that we would work with qualified providers who can professionally administer it at a reduced cost, or for free, to lower income patients.  We do not intend to open our own treatment facility. These funds will also go to exploring the possibility of Iboga Care as a non profit. Iboga Care will be giving 5% of the funds, after fees and expenses, raised during our indiegogo 
campaign to Gabon to help them in their efforts to create sustainable 
iboga plantations in their country.  Iboga Care's idea of giving was born 20 years ago, in the spirit and heart of the ancient gift giving practices Bart learned while living with the Hopi. 
""Bart wanted to spend three months on the Hopi reservation to film the 
dying language of the Hopi tribe, and he needed $4000 in 16mm film stock
 to make this dream a reality. I decided then and there to start a grant
 program in honor of my father, Roy W. Dean, film philanthropist 
extraordinaire! I gave Bart the film, and the Roy W. Dean film grants 
were born. In the true spirit of “Pay 
it Forward,” after spending two years living on the Hopi reservation, 
Bart completed his film HOPILAVAYI, and offered his film and all film rights to the 
Hopi Nation. In appreciation for the film and its message, Brooks 
Institute of Photography offered a full scholarship to a Hopi student. 
Bart’s insight, boldness, and sensitivity caught the attention of the 
film industry, which awarded him the coveted CINE Golden Eagle Award, 
and the Townsend Tenacity Award. HOPILAVAYI was shown at the Directors Guild of America and was in national and 
international film festivals."" Carole Dean, From The Heart Productions.

There are a small handful of countries in the world where iboga and ibogaine 
treatments are illegal. Unfortunately, the United States is one of them.
 Luckily, there are excellent treatment facilities in Canada, Mexico and
 Costa Rica, as well as many other countries. 


Meet the Team


Bart Hawkins of IbogaCare.com has been a filmmaker for over 20 years, with a focus on anthropological issues. He cares deeply about native cultures and their environment. Bart has gained much experience in producing large budget projects from conception to completion.  He holds
degrees in zoology and art, and a degree in film production from Brooks Institute of Photography. Some of his clients
include CNN, Turner Broadcasting, ABC News, Coca-Cola, HGTV, and The Weather Channel. Early in his career, Bart lived with the Hopis in Arizona for 2 years, while he made two films. Then he traveled the world for seven years and had several private talks with the Dalai Lama. Later, in the late 90's he worked with an ex-CIA-lead consciousness research project called the Genesis Affect Project. It is based on nonlinear and non-rational experiences that exist prior to any consciousness or awareness. Collaborated with the Santa Fe Institute and the PEAR group at Princeton University. Bart also has custom home building skills, worked on eco designed sustainable communities and have learned ancient heart heat shamanic skills, use of herbs, and techniques for sacred planting, growing and harvesting. 

He is an avid
hiker, nature enthusiast, healer, organic gardener, and has permaculture and aquaponics knowledge. Cassandra Linnea grew up in Hawaii and has a familiarity with tropical agriculture. She is a Health Coach, artist and herbal medicine enthusiast. She has been in the holistic health sciences for over a decade. She has worked with some
of the leading companies in the supplementation and fitness fields. Her motivation for partnering with Iboga Care stems from witnessing first hand the devastation and death brought on by addiction in her clients, friends and family member. In her experience no herbal or holistic treatment has shown the efficacy as iboga and ibogaine.Eric Taub of ibeginagain.org is the founder and pioneer of the Ibogaine Movement in America, has 
worked since the early 1990′s to bring Ibogaine to the world.  He has developed over the years the 
safest and most beneficial way of administering an Ibogaine treatment. 
This culminated in the creation of his medically supervised model and 
the establishment of the first I Begin Again Treatment Center.  Since 
then he has been active in North and Central America lending his 
knowledge to other Ibogaine administrators and starting up Ibogaine 
treatment centers for drug dependency, withdrawal alleviation, and 
psycho-therapeutic benefit. Eric has long been a proponent of growing 
sustainable iboga trees and is pleased to support Iboga Care in it's 
mission.
Darin McBratney of costaricayogaspa.com has earned international recognition for his beautiful development of the Costa Rica Yoga Spa which is nestled on a 50-acre jungle ranch only minutes from the beach. He here you can unite yoga with iboga. Darin is also a Costa Rica real estate agent and know a lot about growing iboga and the required location.

  What We Need





Here is a breakdown of our funding needs:
Land aquisition, 10-15 acres 

Land improvements; grading, soil samples and soil conditioning/improvement  

Fencing, security, general structural improvements, drilling for a irrigation well 

Hoop house or green house construction and supplies

Purchase sustainable Iboga cuttings.

Ongoing plantation maintenance for the first year

On call iboga arborist


Projected Timeline

By the end of 2014 we plan to travel to Costa Rica, investigate for a non profit status and find appropriate land. Our intent is to create a sustainable iboga farm that becomes self sufficient through donations, gifts and volunteers, thereby creating the opportunity for Iboga Care to donate 100% of the yield. The purchase of the land is not intended to be used for personal uses or personal residency, rather as a working farm. A qualified specialists will over see the daily operations, training and supervising the volunteers. The first few years is the most sensitive time for young iboga trees, needing careful monitoring. Sustainably sourced cuttings will be acquired  from Asian and Latin American sources. In 4-6 years they will be producing the root bark needed for treatments. At this point our partner treatment providers would aid us in creating the best strategy for creating programs for low or no cost treatments.
Our first step with the funds is to pursue a non profit status, then if we reach our goal to acquire land and do necessary land 
improvements. We will create a second
 funding campaign until goals are met.

  Risks & Challenges





As in any plant cultivation, we are aware of the risks of Mother Nature, pests, rodents and unseen natural disasters. We also know the risks involved in the difficulties of growing iboga and crops could potentially fail. We are taking many steps to eliminate as many risks as possible. We understand the risks involving being in a foreign country. We have researched and found that Costa Rica is the most politically and financially stable country south of the border and north of South America. It is also very American friendly, as many Americans live and vacation there.  It takes about 5 years for an iboga tree  to mature. The older the tree, the more powerful the medicine it produces. This is a long term labor of love for all involved and Iboga Care is passionate to bring more iboga medicine to those people who desire it's extraordinary healing properties. We want to give back what Iboga has given so many people, life saving freedom! Thank you for your time to read this, your contributions and sharing in our dream to propagate this extraordinary Tree of Life.     
  Other Ways You Can Help




The most important thing you can do for Iboga's survival, is to educate yourself about iboga and spread the word to as many people as you can.  Use your email, Facebook, all social media outlets, talk to loved ones and friends.  Anyone who is addicted and needing help, suffering from depression, traumas, taking pain meds and anti depressants and all who wish to be freed from certain psychological patterns. Those that are suffering and stuck in life and anyone who dreams of being reborn into freedom. 



Please, if you cannot give to this project, use  the Indiegogo share tools and help promote this 'gift' to humanity!

<p> </p></div>","Hello,
My name is Tom Grier and I have been a Lyme patient advocate for over 20 years. Prior to being misdiagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis from 1989-1991, I was a scientist and worked in many areas of research, but by 1991 Lyme Encephalitis had taken its toll and I spent most of the next five years in bed in pain and unable to work or drive a car.
As a microbiology graduate student I took the entire first two years of medical school courses excluding clinical rotations at the U of MN Duluth Medical School. During that time in 1977 under the auspices of Dr.s Tom and Betty Hamilton I developed a fast test version of the “fluorescent-antibody-coated-bacteria” test that could help determine if bacteria that was present in a bladder infection, had originated from a kidney infection (pyelonephritis). The previous test being used took many hours to prepare and several hours of incubation, results took 24 hours. I shortened this test to less than 20 minutes by combining the infected urine and fluorescent antibody and applying it as an aerosol to the slide and then combined washing and buffering steps to a less than a few minutes.
Under Dr. Omelan Lukasevich I worked on the Mouse Model of Leukemia and worked specifically with T-cells, and developed skills working with rodents.
During these years I also worked on developing a colormetric assay to determine blood sugar in insect hemolymph and several other small projects.
My thesis work was on immunological contraception where I pursued two possible vaccines. One used the female ovum layer called the zonae-pelucida to create an immune response in female hamsters. This required delicate microsurgery techniques often used for limb reattachment. The other vaccine was simply using the beta chain of human chorionic gonadotropin HCG as a vaccine antigen.
When I transferred to the U of WA I entered into a PhD program simply called Geriatrics and worked that summer on rat bone cell densities. However the Geriatrics program was hastily moved from the college of Biochemistry into Social Sciences, and I left the program to pursue a career in the pharmaceutical industry.
During this time was when I was becoming sicker and sicker to the point where by 1991, I was on a waiting list for assisted living and unable to drive or remain upright without passing out. During that time while I was flat on my back I researched Lyme as best I could (in those early years there was almost nothing useful on the Internet that was patient oriented, and like so many other patients I was scared by what I had and what doctors did not seem to understand.)
So in 1994 I wrote a 105 page booklet for Lyme patients (for $7.95) called: “The 1995  Lyme Disease Survival Manual”  which within months of publication traveled all over the world, and I immediately received calls from desperate patients from Japan, Finland, Germany, Spain, France, Canada, and even Africa. It was clear I was not alone and that this was a worldwide dilemma. I am proud of that booklet not only because I researched it and wrote it when I was quite ill, but because all of the predictions that I made about Lyme disease have now come to pass.
Over the years since I never said no to anyone who wanted to copy the booklet or reprint it because I never wanted another human being to go through what I experienced with the feeling that there was no hope or treatment options.  
For the past 20 years I have run the Duluth MN Lyme Disease Support Group.  During that time I have accepted calls from all over the world and have tried to be accessible to all patients seeking questions day or night. I have always considered my role as helping patients better understand this disease and the microbiology that makes Lyme a persistent disease..
I wanted to help Lyme patients develop a useful and accurate scientific disease vocabulary and a cogent understanding of the science behind Lyme disease. In simple and understandable terms I wanted patients to understand testing, diagnosis and treatment. All my written articles have always been in the public domain and have circulated free to patients or doctors. Over three-dozen papers of my papers on Lyme disease have been available on web sites for two decades.
Contrary to any misbeliefs nothing I did received any funding except through the goodwill offerings at lectures and Lyme Disease Support Group. (The Duluth MN group is the longest continuing running LDSG in the World!)
During my time as a Lyme advocate I also returned to the lab several times to gain a personal insight with the Borrelia organism. But since 1999 the labs at the Medical School and the hospitals where I had lab access are now owned by HMOs and are essentially shut down to research, so my access to microscopes and equipment became very limited.
Currently I help register MS, Lyme and Dementia patients for brain autopsies. The lab we send tissue samples to then stains brain tissue and looks for spirochetes in the brain even in patients after they have had aggressive antibiotic therapy.
In 1995 I administered a antibiotic treatment study of 26 MS patients from Minnesota and found 3 of 26 seronegative MS patients, seroconverted and had Lyme antibodies. Eight of the twenty-six patients improved after 3 months. Another patient who was a treatment failure at three months, continued antibiotics for 15 months had a nearly full recovery. The Minnesota Department of Health refused to acknowledge the study despite repeated visits to their medical officers.
Although our numbers of autopsies in our current and on-going brain study are low, we have not only had positive brain samples, but we have also seen correlations on brain-MRIs that can now help us differentiate some misdiagnosed Multiple Sclerosis cases that have unquestionably turned out to be Lyme disease. We need bigger numbers and more patients to attract interest by medical institutions to do a multicenter brain pathology study.
I am sorry to say that without any financial support or a regular income over the past 20 years I have found myself financially unable to take on bigger and better Lyme disease research projects or maintain much of a normal lifestyle beyond simply surviving.
Currently I intend to get back into the laboratory and do some basic Lyme research. To do this I require some basic lab equipment. The good news is that because of Russian and Chinese competition in the last dozen years or so, the costs of microscopes have come down.  The bad news is almost all lab equipment has become more expensive than ever.
I am seeking a minimum amount of money to begin some simple yet important Lyme disease projects. What follows is a partial list of needs that come to about $5,000 .  This does not include such things as lab space costs or personal time. All of the intended use of this equipment is non-profit and for research and not for creating a business, creating an income or to provide human testing. I have no conflicts of interest to report and hope my work can be as nonbiased as possible.
Thank you,
Thomas Grier

South Street Ministries was becoming a community development organization, starting with our own renovation process.  The Front Porch was becoming a hub for community development.  In 2014, new organizational partners approached South Street Ministries about working together. World Relief set up an Akron office for refugee resettlement and Faithful Servants began the collaborative conversation with South Street Ministries about developing a mobile health clinic in the back room of the Front Porch.  The Front Porch is a hub for organizational collaboration and community health.South Street Ministries has completed $250,000 worth of renovations for only $125,000 actual cash.  At the end of 2014, South Street Ministries was a recipient of a fundraising campaign that brought in approximately $138,000 to further the next phases of construction, including kitchen renovations, first and second floor restrooms, and plumbing.  However, there is still a large amount of construction remaining: the second floor, the exterior stair-well, and the back-room.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

journey since being diagnosed with Stage 4 prostate cancer and his treatment in Germany last year. With your support - 
and Tim's own tenacity and perseverance - he has succeeded in keeping the 
disease from metastasizing, which his imaging continues to confirm as 
being stable. He's even been re-staged to Stage 3!<br/><br/><div>However, Tim is still on disability due to the extreme adverse effects of conventional hormone blockade, which in a non-medical scenario is known as 'chemical castration'. He knows that he's not out of the woods yet and has spent the past year carefully examining his 
treatment options. He continues to resist the fear that often accompanies a cancer diagnosis, while working closely with his naturopath -- as well as with his conventional doctors who unfortunately insist that external beam radiation is his 'only'
 choice.<br/><br/><div>On his Vancouver naturopath's advice, he's chosen an effective treatment that has been common in Germany and Austria for years but which is still under clinical trials in Canada and not yet available here in North America. He's been accepted for treatment in September at Dr. Ralf
 Kleef's Immunotherapy and Integrative Oncology Clinic in Vienna 
 (<a href=""http://dr-kleef.at/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://dr-kleef.at/en/</a>).<br/><br/>The treatment is called trans-urethral hyperthermia (TUH), which uses radio frequency waves to heat the
 prostate tumour from within, in combination with intravenous natural 
substances that his previous blood tests showed his cancer was
 sensitive to (ascorbic acid, artemisinin and curcumin). Unlike normal 
cells, cancer cells don't handle high temperatures well and they die 
under such extremes, especially when they're also bombarded with the cancer-fighting 
substances just mentioned. He'll undergo two weeks of treatment that 
includes TUH, external local deep hyperthermia, ozone therapy, and other treatments 
that kill cancer but don't damage healthy tissues the way radiation does.<br/><br/><div>Tim feels good about this decision and is looking forward to treatment. It's his fervent hope that he can return to work in October after his treatments.<br/><br/><div>Of
 course, none of the US$13,000 treatment cost is paid for by his 
provincial or employer health plans. And while we'll use savings to pay for some of the treatment costs and the US$5,000 in airfare and accommodation costs, I'm turning to you - Tim's 
family, friends and colleagues - for financial support to help defray the rest of his treatment expenses. <br/><br/>If you are moved and able to help, please know that contributions can be made in U.S. or Canadian dollars using either a credit card or a Paypal account.<br/><br/>
We appreciate any contribution you can make - large or 
small - and if you can't offer financial support, we most certainly will
 appreciate your thoughts, prayers, visualizations and meditations on a 
cure for Tim during his upcoming treatments.<br/><br/>In appreciation for your support, Tim will email you a series of 15-minute MP3 audio meditations guided by Deepok Chopra (described under ""Perks"").<br/><br/>Every contributor, regardless of contribution level, will be invited to join Tim's online Tyze page where he'll share his progress and where you can share your thoughts and messages.<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Hi my name is Carrie and I have chronic Lyme disease-and I'm pissed off about it. Not at being sick per say-but the fact that I, like so many other people who suffer from this disease, have been denied adequate treatment.</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why I'm fundraising</h3>
<p>I am about to start my third course of treatment for Lyme disease-yes you read that correctly. I have done 2 courses of treatment previously, and in my mind have been severely undertreated. I now have an appointment to see a specialist, or what we refer to in the Lyme community as a Lyme Literate MD and I'm overjoyed at the prospect of FINALLY getting proper treatment! There's one tiny problem however, and that is LLMD's aren't currently taking insurance. Why you ask? It's because these doctors have chosen to treat outside the current guidelines which state that Lyme disease has no chronic form and is easily treatable with a few weeks of antibiotics. Clearly in my experience-along with countless others-this is not the case. Luckily, there are compassionate doctors out there who've seen the light; unluckily, their recognition and treatment of chronic Lyme disease has cost them their relationship with health insurance companies. The result of this split is that it's expensive, and I mean <em>really</em> expensive, to see a LLMD-and this financial burden falls entirely on the patient-who is required to pay for treatment out of pocket.</p>
<p>I have done my research and made an appointment with a doctor I believe I can put full confidence in. However, my initial treatment bill will look as follows:</p>
<p>Cost of initial visit: $700</p>
<p>First visit lab tests: $1,200 give or take</p>
<p>Montly follow-up visits: $250</p>
<p>Meds &amp; Supplements: Depend on diagnosis, etc, etc</p>
<p>I do have something called out of network benefits built into my insurance plan and thus can get partial reimbursements for my expenses. My hope is to raise enough money to get over the initial financial hurdle, begin treatment as soon as possible, then continue to recycle the money that I'm reimbursed and use it for further medical expenses. If you're doing the calculations and $2,500 seems a bit high, that's because when this course of treatment is all said and done, I'd like to donate whatever money is left over to a worthy Lyme disease organization. In short, any and all money donated to this campaign will go to Lyme disease.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Impact</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Unfortunately Lyme disease is growing at exponential rates-with the number of new cases reported getting higher each year. In my area of the US you can't even utter the words Lyme disease without hearing about how someone's cousin, neighbor, sister-in-law have it. This disease isn't going away-in fact it's growing and continuing to affect more people each year. </p>
<p>It is crucial that the medical community change their stance on treatment practices and policies regarding Lyme disease. This disease is treatable if addressed early and aggressively enough. However, people continue to go misdiagnosed and/or as in my case, undertreated. I do think that eventually things will change and as more people are sick and finding it hard to get proper treatment that the infectious disease powers at be will have to listen. For them to listen however, we first have to make some noise!  </p>

<p></p><p align=""justify"">Hi, my name is <a href=""http://www.pureheartsinternational.org/#!pastor/c14pk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Carson Lester Jr</a>. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Since the age of 19, by God's grace, I have been a committed disciple of Jesus Christ (here's my <a href=""http://www.pureheartsinternational.org/#!autobiography/c1evc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">testimony</a>). My mother is a PK (preacher's kid) and I am a PGK (preacher's grand kid). My Grandfather, the Reverend Earl Fultz, was a Pentecostal Preacher who pastored his own large church (the Rochester, Michigan ""Church of God"") for 40 plus years before he passed away at age 79 in 1990. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p align=""justify"">3 years ago, in 2010, I met my wife <a href=""http://www.pureheartsinternational.org/#!wife-of-pastor/ckjx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Floremay Ordaniel</a> (also pictured above) on Facebook! I then flew to the Philippines where I met her face to face and married her in 2011! And I am still here 3 years later building up, by God's grace, <a href=""http://www.PureHeartsInternational.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pure Hearts International</a> (which is a combination nutritional supplement company with an affiliate marketing income opportunity, non-denominational internet church and Filipino-oriented charity--a truly global <a href=""http://www.pureheartsinternational.org/#!our-slidely-one/cgyi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>social entrepreneurship</a> organization if there ever was one)! And we have a young son named Abraham Rav Aluf Ordaniel Lester! </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p align=""justify"">If you'd ever like to look at our <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/johncarsonlesterjr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lester Family Photo Album</a>, I just started it up this month on Flicker. We already have over 10,000+ pics and 100+ videos and we're just getting that started. I believe you can learn a lot about people by looking at their family photo albums! Right now we have uploaded only the last two year's worth of pics here in only the Philippines because that was easy to get off of Floremay's iPhone. I have thousands and thousands more to add, not only from the Philippines, but from my whole life, saved and lurking about here and there on my hard drive. I'll get it all up there eventually. Floremay, as you can read about at the PHI link above, comes from a very poor Filipino family that never had many family pictures in the first place and what few they had were tragically destroyed a number of years ago in a fire. The only pics she has today of her younger life are pics she's been able to get from relatives.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p align=""justify"">Before I ever knew of Floremay's existence, as explained at this <a href=""http://www.pureheartsinternational.org/#!our-slidely-two/c20t1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">slide show</a> <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">and the bottom paragraphs of the home page at </span><a href=""http://www.pureheartsinternational.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></a><a href=""http://www.pureheartsinternational.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pure Hearts International</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, Floremay has been a quiet unsung HERO leading the way here in the Philippines for years when it comes to feeding the Filipino poor! Therefore, it was a natural fit for my American nutritional supplement company, already with a spiritual mission to spread the gospel along with good health around the world, to add the mission of feeding the Filipino poor as well. So for almost 3 years now, PHI has been helping and feeding the Filipino poor in La Castellana and Bacolod City on Negros Occidental provincial island in the Philippines. Every $100 donation we receive, we ship a ""token thank you gift"" of 1-bottle (1-month's supply) of our outstanding all natural </span><a href=""http://www.pureheartsinternational.org/#!pure-foy-details/c1ot2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">PURE FOY</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> mineral and energy nutritional supplement! We have already shipped/supplied over 3,000 plus bottles of PURE FOY, by God's grace, and counting, in this charity mission, and raised over $300,000 plus dollars thus far, and counting, thanks to the generosity of our <a href=""http://www.pureheartsinternational.org/#!top-donors/csus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TOP DONORS</a>! </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Philippines, while poor, is a very, very important place in God's Kingdom. For example, the Philippines easily leads the Top 5 countries of Strong Faith and God believers:</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">1. Philippines - 94%</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">2. Chile - 79.4%</span></p><p>3. Israel - 65.5%</p><p>4. Poland - 62%</p><p>5. United States - 60.6%<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">​</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span><span><span>According to Price Waterhouse's publication </span></span><em>Doing Business In The Philippines </em><span>(1989), Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Taiwan, Brunei, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the Union of Myamar (formerly known as Burma), and most of Japan, Korea, and China surround the Philippine capital city of Manila within a short 2500-mile radius. In fact, almost <em>one-third</em> of the world's population lives within this 2500-mile geographic radius of Manila! Manila, which, in its own right, is the 8th largest city in the world with 19 million (19,000,000) residents, is also the <em>only</em> major city in the world that can boast that one-third of the world's population is within 2500 miles of its borders! Thus, as the <em>third </em><em>largest</em> English speaking country in the world, and as the <em>only </em>majority-Christian Asian nation in the world (95% of the God believers in the Philippines are Christian, whereas 5% are Muslim), and as the # 1 Call Center country in the world, the Philippines is <em>uniquely</em> positioned to export American/Christian values to Asia (the fastest growing and most populous region on Planet Earth both today and tomorrow and for the rest of our lifetimes). As various modern Christian prophets have prophesied recently, it is imperative that we help and support their advancement because, in multiple ways, the Philippines is <em>strategically</em> located in the Kingdom of God on Earth! </span></span></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">So I love the Filipino people with all of my heart because they are literally my family, my blood, and they are my brothers and sisters in Christ. And it absolutely breaks my heart every day when I see hungry Filipino children everywhere you look in this large island country. You can not even begin to imagine the amount of tears I have shed in the hospitals and on the streets of the Philippines here because of the sick and the poor everywhere! It's heart breaking to see them suffer like <a href=""http://www.pureheartsinternational.org/#!more-videos/c1ulf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this</a>! It's a human tragedy of epic proportions! Most Filipinos suffer every day whether there is a killer typhoon like Haiyan / Yolanda or not! You can never really even begin to understand how blessed we are as Americans until you have lived for a long time in a Third World country like the Philippines and discover how ""the other half"" of the world lives and suffers daily. 40% of the Filipino people live on $1.25 or less per day! Now I know and I will never, ever forget, by God's grace, as long as I shall live because now I see it every day with my own eyes... </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Your gift, no matter how small, or large, helps immensely, regardless of whether we meet our humble monthly $500 minimum goal or not. 70% of whatever you give goes directly to the Filipino poor, again, regardless of whether we meet our humble monthly $500 minimum goal or not. It doesn't matter whether we raise $100 or $100 million dollars, the percentage result is the same! For every $100 you give, that makes $70 available to buy rice to feed Filipinos always hungry in the poor rural areas of La Castellana (daily difficulties now compounded by Haiyan / Yolanda blowing the roofs off of their bamboo hut houses, with some entire bamboo houses now destroyed). Rice costs only about 30 pesos per kilo which is about 70 cents per kilo (2.2 lbs). Therefore, your $100 donation buys about 100 kilos or 220 lbs of rice, which feeds a Filipino family of four, for example, for many, many weeks! There has never been  a more important time for you to give than now because many of these families, already poor, have been practically wiped out because typhoon Haiyan / Yolanda has completely destroyed or at least deeply damaged the very rice and sugar cane fields that these poor Filipino families work on and subsist upon in their agricultural and rural way of life! </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">If the Lord has mightily blessed you with abundance or you just feel to dig down deep to give to and help the needy Filipino people, for every $1000 you give, we will ship you an ENTIRE CASE (20 bottles or a 20-month supply) of our all natural <a href=""http://www.pureheartsinternational.org/#!pure-foy-details/c1ot2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PURE FOY</a> herbal mineral and energy nutritional supplement!

Hi, my name is John Carson Lester Jr. Since the age of 19, by God's grace, I have been a committed disciple of Jesus Christ (here's my testimony). My mother is a PK (preacher's kid) and I am a PGK (preacher's grand kid). My Grandfather, the Reverend Earl Fultz, was a Pentecostal Preacher who pastored his own large church (the Rochester, Michigan ""Church of God"") for 40 plus years before he passed away at age 79 in 1990. 
3 years ago, in 2010, I met my wife Floremay Ordaniel (also pictured above) on Facebook! I then flew to the Philippines where I met her face to face and married her in 2011! And I am still here 3 years later building up, by God's grace, Pure Hearts International (which is a combination nutritional supplement company with an affiliate marketing income opportunity, non-denominational internet church and Filipino-oriented charity--a truly global social entrepreneurship organization if there ever was one)! And we have a young son named Abraham Rav Aluf Ordaniel Lester! 
If you'd ever like to look at our Lester Family Photo Album, I just started it up this month on Flicker. We already have over 10,000+ pics and 100+ videos and we're just getting that started. I believe you can learn a lot about people by looking at their family photo albums! Right now we have uploaded only the last two year's worth of pics here in only the Philippines because that was easy to get off of Floremay's iPhone.

<b>Socrates Health Solutions, Inc. of Dallas, Texas</b> has
developed a working prototype of a <b><i>noninvasive</i></b> glucose monitor. As
demonstrated in the video, CEO Scott Smith explains that his company, comprised
of a team of scientists, engineers, physicians and healthcare professionals,
has developed a new way to determine glucose levels in the bloodstream -
without the painful and costly ""prick"" method available today. By
simply attaching a sensor to the ear, the user can get an accurate blood
glucose reading in seconds. There are over 371 million diabetics worldwide. 2
million people are added to the existing 26 million diabetics in the United
States every year. Socrates is asking for your help to literally<i> Change the World </i>for diabetics
everywhere.

<p>For over 20 years, companies around the world have tried to
produce a working prototype of the elusive <i>Holy
Grail</i> of medical devices...the noninvasive glucose monitor.  Many have tried, but to date the results have
been mixed at best.  The patent pending
method behind the Companion<sup>TM</sup> device differs from all those that
have tried this before, allowing for a much more affordable and reliable
device.</p>
<p>Though Companion<sup>TM</sup> is a working prototype today,
it is NOT FOR SALE and will not be available to the general public until it
passes FDA approval.  That is why we need
your help.  The funds received from this
project will go to support the FDA process, clinical trials, legal expenses and
operational requirements needed to pass FDA approval.</p>

developed a working prototype of a noninvasive glucose monitor. As
demonstrated in the video, CEO Scott Smith explains that his company, comprised
of a team of scientists, engineers, physicians and healthcare professionals,
has developed a new way to determine glucose levels in the bloodstream -
without the painful and costly ""prick"" method available today. By
simply attaching a sensor to the ear, the user can get an accurate blood
glucose reading in seconds. There are over 371 million diabetics worldwide. 2
million people are added to the existing 26 million diabetics in the United
States every year. Socrates is asking for your help to literally Change the World for diabetics
everywhere.

For over 20 years, companies around the world have tried to
produce a working prototype of the elusive Holy
Grail of medical devices...the noninvasive glucose monitor.  Many have tried, but to date the results have
been mixed at best.  The patent pending
method behind the CompanionTM device differs from all those that
have tried this before, allowing for a much more affordable and reliable
device.
Though CompanionTM is a working prototype today,
it is NOT FOR SALE and will not be available to the general public until it
passes FDA approval.  That is why we need
your help.  The funds received from this
project will go to support the FDA process, clinical trials, legal expenses and
operational requirements needed to pass FDA approval.
We appreciate your support and are excited about you joining
us in Changing the World for DIABETICS.

Evolution...







Risks and challenges
Every newly developed electronic
device has challenges. Currently, Companion is in its 4th generation of
development. Internally, we call this - Companion Thing 4. Thing 4 is in the
picture above and is what Scott Smith demonstrates in the video. Yes, Scott is
able to test his blood sugar without pricking his finger - accurately and
painlessly.
Now that we have a working
prototype, our next challenge is FDA approval. Socrates is committed to
producing a safe, effective, accurate and pain-free solution for diabetics who
must check their blood glucose levels several times a day. Getting FDA approval
is the top priority for Companion.
Clearly, not receiving FDA
approval is a risk. That is why Socrates has several consultants and advisors
to guide us every step of the way through this process. We are confident that
this funding will allow us to make a significant step toward receiving FDA
approval and bringing what will be a life-changing product to the market for
diabetics...not only in the United States, but around the world.

<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>HOW DOES IT WORK ?</b></p><p><i>Similar to an MRI device</i>, our technology is based on the principle that different types of tissue in the body will respond to different strength magnetic fields (ie nerve tissue responds to a different magnetic field than muscle, or bone). Our system, with the assistance of a healthcare professional, will immerse a patient into a specific, biologic magnetic field found to effect the tissues associated with their problem and create a ""relaxation response"". <a href=""http://magneceutical.com/providers/clinical_research.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Relaxation Response</a> and its ability to address any number of the 
symptoms associated with chronic stress is not only well understood, it 
is also an important modality in the battle to attain and then retain a <i>healthy state</i>
 for patients. Dr. Jacobson, as well as independent principle 
investigators from Universities such as Cornell, Fairleigh Dickinson, 
and the University of Oklahoma, have studied magnetic fields for over 25
 years and had amazing results that identify specific biologic effects 
of our very precise, physiologic electromagnetic fields. </p><p><b>For more information about how our technology works, please check out the video below.</b></p>

<p>Basically, we need $4,000 to get a Halo into the Home of a Veteran. So with this $20,000 campaign, (after paying for direct costs like Indiegogo charges, credit card fees, and reward costs) we should be able to place 4 Halos with our Heroes.</p>
<p>IF we don’t meet the goal…. We will still send Halos to our Heroes with the money we do collect ! So its definitely not an “all or nothing” raise, but we hope to help as many as we can (and that’s driven primarily by YOU)</p>
<p>But we aren't worried about missing our Goal... we want to BEAT IT and hit a Stretch Goal of $30,000 (or more) as this will allow us to place at least 2 more Halos with our Vets.<br/></p>

<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>“Help a Veteran”…. For almost every person in our country that is Easy to Say, Easy to Agree with … <b>BUT NOT VERY EASY TO DO!</b></p>
<p>We can’t make a big difference on  the “how, what, and when” the VA gets its act together to properly care for these men and women.</p>
<p>But we have a cutting edge technology that, when combined with the skill and commitment of the Chiropractors at the Patriot Project, can <b>make a huge impact on a veteran’s life in ONE DAY</b>. All without Drugs, Shots, or Surgery !</p>
<p>The biggest Casualty of our Wars, is to be Forgotten.  <b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Please provide your Donation and let them know that you didn’t forget</b>.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND CHALLENGES?</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Almost none exist for this Project , as we already have lined up:</p>
<p>A. Wounded Veterans that need Help.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">B. Chiropractors at the Patriot Project ready, willing and able to help.</span></p>
<p>C. Halo Devices being manufactured and sold today (ie these are not “prototypes”, they are ready for prime time).</p>
<p>The only thing that is lacking is money for the Veterans to be able to afford a Halo in their Home…. That’s where <b>your contribution becomes the key to solving the Problem.</b></p>

<p><b>What kind of conditions can be treated by the HALO ?</b></p>
<p>The HALO is designed to enhance feelings of relaxation, and this allows us to address symptoms associated with ""chronic stress"" which is known to play a key role in many different disease states or conditions. Accordingly, there are a number of studies that support many different aspects of ""health improvement"" when stress is reduced.  Anecdotally, <a href=""http://magnesphere.info/?magpage=testimonials_s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">many people have reported improvement with a wide variety of health conditions.</a></p>
<p>The Magnesphere Halo™ is intended to enhance feelings of relaxation, and is not intended to
        diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. 
      <a href=""http://magnesphere.info/?magpage=testimonials_s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><br/></a></p>
<b>Is this technology safe?</b>
<p>As a Class 1 device we are considered the lowest risk category.  The Magnesphere™ is classified under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation 21 CFR 890.5660.

</div></div>","Why We Launched This Campaign 





The Patriot Project (and its 800+ participating Chiropractors) are teaming with Magneceutical Health (and its game changing therapeutic technology) to bring much needed HEALING to our Veterans (and their battlefield stresses, strains, and pains), without the use of Drugs, Shots, or Surgeries.

The numbers are staggering and the Veterans Administration cannot meet their needs: 


2.3 million Veterans served in Iraq and Afghanistan wars and @ 20% suffer PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) and/or Depression   
260,000 diagnosed with TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury)   
22 Veterans die by Suicide everyday (2-3 times the National Avg)



But we have another Solution for our Wounded Heroes and they need your Help to get it into their HOME:
A natural energy based therapeutic treatment deployed through the skilled hands of the Chiropractors at the Patriot Project… the Magnesphere HALO ™.  Our Device will provide a “relaxation response” that helps in addressing any number of symptoms commonly associated with the Stress of the Battlefield… Pain, Stiffness, Energy Level,  and Poor Sleep.
So we’ve got the Ultimate Crowdfunding Project… “A Great Cause that uses the Latest Technology”



If you could see Magnetic Fields.... this is what they would look like with our System.

HOW DOES IT WORK ?Similar to an MRI device, our technology is based on the principle that different types of tissue in the body will respond to different strength magnetic fields (ie nerve tissue responds to a different magnetic field than muscle, or bone). Our system, with the assistance of a healthcare professional, will immerse a patient into a specific, biologic magnetic field found to effect the tissues associated with their problem and create a ""relaxation response"". The Relaxation Response and its ability to address any number of the 
symptoms associated with chronic stress is not only well understood, it 
is also an important modality in the battle to attain and then retain a healthy state
 for patients. Dr. Jacobson, as well as independent principle 
investigators from Universities such as Cornell, Fairleigh Dickinson, 
and the University of Oklahoma, have studied magnetic fields for over 25
 years and had amazing results that identify specific biologic effects 
of our very precise, physiologic electromagnetic fields. For more information about how our technology works, please check out the video below.





WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET
Our Wounded Heroes have plenty of Scars…. But little Money!

Your Contributions will help get HALO devices into the HOMES of our Heroes at NO COST to them.

Additionally, we’ve got some very cool perks (rewards) for YOU, like: 



A ""Karma Credit"" because you feel good when you do good.  And if everyone who came to this page gave $5 this campaign would be over today ... and the healing could begin tomorrow!

A lifetime place on our ""Wall of Fame""


Commemorative Patriot Project  T-shirts & Collector Coins


Magazine subscriptions that go to our Active Duty Service members (we can't just help those that are Veterans and forget about the ones still on the front lines).

And for those willing to ""dig a little deeper"" and come out of pocket for $1,000 or more, we've put together some rewards that allow YOU to try the HALO in your OWN HOME (see below for more detail).







































Basically, we need $4,000 to get a Halo into the Home of a Veteran. So with this $20,000 campaign, (after paying for direct costs like Indiegogo charges, credit card fees, and reward costs) we should be able to place 4 Halos with our Heroes.
IF we don’t meet the goal…. We will still send Halos to our Heroes with the money we do collect ! So its definitely not an “all or nothing” raise, but we hope to help as many as we can (and that’s driven primarily by YOU)
But we aren't worried about missing our Goal... we want to BEAT IT and hit a Stretch Goal of $30,000 (or more) as this will allow us to place at least 2 more Halos with our Vets.


 

 
THE IMPACT
“Help a Veteran”…. For almost every person in our country that is Easy to Say, Easy to Agree with … BUT NOT VERY EASY TO DO!
We can’t make a big difference on  the “how, what, and when” the VA gets its act together to properly care for these men and women.
But we have a cutting edge technology that, when combined with the skill and commitment of the Chiropractors at the Patriot Project, can make a huge impact on a veteran’s life in ONE DAY. All without Drugs, Shots, or Surgery !
The biggest Casualty of our Wars, is to be Forgotten.  
Please provide your Donation and let them know that you didn’t forget.
   WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND CHALLENGES?  
Almost none exist for this Project , as we already have lined up:
A. Wounded Veterans that need Help.
B. Chiropractors at the Patriot Project ready, willing and able to help.
C. Halo Devices being manufactured and sold today (ie these are not “prototypes”, they are ready for prime time).
The only thing that is lacking is money for the Veterans to be able to afford a Halo in their Home…. That’s where your contribution becomes the key to solving the Problem.


   OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP? 

Whether you contribute or not, if you got all the way to the end of this page then you’ve shown enough interest to at least reach out to family and friends  via email, facebook, twitter, etc and help us spread the word. (note if you don’t have any of that stuff you can use the Indiegogo share tools below.. its really just that easy)
We appreciate your assist and thank you for the time spent.
God Bless our Country… and those that keep and protect it.

  Sybernetics est un changement de paradigme pour le monde du sport. ""Sport = Santé"" est malheureusement une équation fausse la plupart du temps. La majorité des sports aujourd'hui (incluant la musculation) promeuvent des valeurs comme le dépassement de ses limites (jusqu'à épuisement), la compétition (davantage que la coopération), et l'acceptation de la douleur (là où nous promouvons la reconnexion à soi).  Quand musculation rime avec libération. Sybernetics est une méthode universelle. Donc vous avez le choix dès le début du livre de vous entraîner avec les outils traditionnels des salles de musculation (haltères, kettlebells, élastiques, barres, machines...) ou bien de vous entraîner au poids-du-corps pour pouvoir vous entraîner chez vous ou en déplacement. Sybernetics is a universal method. You can choose to apply our strategies with dumbbells, kettlebells, straps, and weighted bars, or go for bodyweight exercises to train literally anywhere (at home, at the gym, in vacation…)""Sport = Health"".Sadly, this equation is FALSE most of the time.  Most sports today (including bodybuilding) are about : always pushing your limits (until exhaustion) , competition (rather than cooperation) and acceptation of pain (rather than improving self-control and sensibility). It's said that ""No Pain No Gain"", or ""Go Hard or Go Home""... Injuries and doping are a logical corollary of this ideology. It was about time to pour a great glass of serious science on this mythology.   En musculation traditionnelle, atteindre des hautes performances demande beaucoup de temps, d'énergie et de volonté. Avec Sybernetics, il ne sera plus nécéssaire de vous forcer pour aller à la salle. Notre approche stratégique est fondée sur la recherche de l'Efficience : plus de résultats pour moins d'énergie et moins de temps. In traditional Bodybuilding, achieving high performance is time-and-energy consuming and requires tons of willpower.With Sybernetics, brutalising yourself to go to the gym will be a thing of the past.A strategic approach implies seeking Efficiency.

Effort Efficiency: more results for less energy.

Time Efficiency: more results for less time spent training-out​

<p><b>We provide a simple solution for supermarkets to reduce their perishable food loss &amp; deliver the consumer those savings via mobile.</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Our Mission: </b>EcoBasket’s mission is to reduce the amount of perishable food wasted every day by Supermarkets through easy-to-use smartphone coupons that save you money. It’s simple: they waste less, you save more.</p>
<p><b>The Problem</b>: Food is the number one material sent to landfills in the U.S. On average, the U.S. wastes 40% of the food we produce.</p>
<p>Customers who shop in any of the enormous supermarkets expect only the freshest vegetables, fruits, meats, fish, and dairy. Supermarket managers have no choice but to throw out 39% of their inventory as a daily routine. If you run one of these supermarkets, waste is simply the cost of doing business. The USDA estimates that supermarkets lose $15 billion annually in unsold fruits and vegetables alone.</p>

<br/><p></p></span></span></span></span></span></div>","We provide a simple solution for supermarkets to reduce their perishable food loss & deliver the consumer those savings via mobile.


Our Mission: EcoBasket’s mission is to reduce the amount of perishable food wasted every day by Supermarkets through easy-to-use smartphone coupons that save you money. It’s simple: they waste less, you save more.
The Problem: Food is the number one material sent to landfills in the U.S. On average, the U.S. wastes 40% of the food we produce.
Customers who shop in any of the enormous supermarkets expect only the freshest vegetables, fruits, meats, fish, and dairy. Supermarket managers have no choice but to throw out 39% of their inventory as a daily routine. If you run one of these supermarkets, waste is simply the cost of doing business. The USDA estimates that supermarkets lose $15 billion annually in unsold fruits and vegetables alone.





EcoBasket Overview: 
They waste less, you save more. 
• EcoBasket provides a simple way to redeem coupons for perishable goods, letting you save every time you shop for fresh fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy 
• EcoBasket enables stores to create coupons quickly based on their needs  
HOW DOES THIS WORK?



The customer's smartphone will identify the location and the customer will be able to see the coupons automatically as he/she enters the store
EcoBasket will serve both the consumer and retailers.
Consumer Benefits:
•Immediate savings on fresh food fruits, vegetables, meats, and dairy
•Eliminate the need for paper coupons and circulars
•Loyalty program to benefit the frequent shopper
•HUGE money savings weekly, monthly and yearly
Retailer Benefits:

•Quicker reimbursement
•Ability to process coupons immediately

<p></p>
<p>I have been practicing yoga for over ten years, since I was
first diagnosed with lupus.  Lupus is an
autoimmune disease, which means my body creates antibodies against itself.  When I get sick or run down, those antibodies
attack my healthy cells instead of the unhealthy virus.  Then, my organs and body systems stop
functioning properly, because they are under assault.  Any small cold or flu lingers much longer
than it should, and I live with the constant pain of inflamed muscles and
tissues.  It is an awful, chronic
condition.</p>
<p>Four things enable me to live an active and fulfilling life:</p>
<p></p><ol>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Regular exercise</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
(running, biking, swimming, or any other cardio exercise, 30 minutes at a time,
5-6 days a week)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Yoga</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> (simple and
gentle postures helped get the blood circulating through my body, my joints a
little more open and flexible, and my muscles stronger)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Healthy eating</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
(sugar, flour, and dairy have been replaced with whole, natural and organic
foods, especially fruits and veggies)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Psychological
treatment</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> to deal with the depression that follows such a diagnosis at only
28, and start focusing on how I can live well with this disease.</span><br/>
</li>
</ol><p></p>
<p>My goal is to be able to share these four keys to living with
lupus with other patients living in DC, as well as other cities on the East
Coast.  I am trying to raise $2,500 over
the next six weeks to support a number of activities that will enable me to
provide yoga instruction, health education, and emotional support to people
living with lupus. </p>
<p>Estimates vary on the number of lupus sufferers in the United
States ranges from approximately 300,000 to 1.5 million people. Most people
with lupus are women. Anyone of any race can have the disease; however, African
American women have triple the incidence (number of new cases) than White
women.  There
is currently no cure for the disease, and most of the approved medical
treatments have serious side affects (blindness, diabetes, and hair loss, to
name just a few).  A healthy lifestyle
(including regular exercise, yoga, healthy eating, and psychological treatment)
can help these women live well with lupus.</p>

</h3> <p>As
of Dec 11 2014, over 18,000 Cases of Ebola have been reported to the World
Health Organization.  WHO estimates that the true number of cases may be much higher.   In Africa, 7 of 10 Ebola patients die.  Yet, in the developed world, the death rate of patients who receive early and comprehensive supportive care is near zero.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Shortage of Clinicians<br/>
</h3>
<p>Ebola has overwhelmed the resources of affected countries and caused collapse of local healthcare systems.  While the international response to Ebola has been mounting, there remains a persistent shortage of organizations willing and able to send and support trained clinicians to run new and existing medical facilities in West Africa.  International Mutual Aid is a Maryland nonprofit, founded by a group of medical professionals.  IMA's purpose is to provide the organizational structure, funding, and logistical support for our team of volunteer doctors, nurses, paramedics, and logisticians to work safely in West Africa, treating patients and helping to rebuild local healthcare systems.</p>
<p></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Simple Supportive Care <br/>
</h3>
<p>IMA is coordinating with WHO, existing NGOs, and local partners to provide assistance where it will be most effective.  Our small, highly trained and experienced group of clinicians will train and equip a larger group of local civilians who will work with us to safely treat patients.  We will focus on achievable, outcome-changing treatments, including rehydration, electrolyte replenishment, and treatment of opportunistic infections.  </p>
<p>While supportive care for Ebola patients is relatively simple, the logistics of providing it safely are not.  A key part of our operational expenses will be medical equipment.  IMA's opening funding goal of $20,000 allows us to ship a 40' sea container filled with $500,000 of medical equipment and PPE, donated by Project Cure, to West Africa.  IMA is a small, flexible organization, founded in response to the Ebola epidemic.  Every dollar contributed has a direct effect on our ability to accomplish our goals.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>$20,000 Pays IMA's Matching Portion of a $500,000 Equipment Grant Offered by Project Cure.</h3>
This comes in the form of a 40' sea container packed and shipped by 
Project Cure with the PPE and medical equipment we request, including IV
 fluids, IV sets, needles, mattresses, gloves, gowns, goggles, boots, 
and much more.  <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>You Can Fight Ebola: More than Money</h3> <p>We are witnessing the first great acutely deadly epidemic of the Age of Globalization.  The Western world has been affected by a corresponding plague of fear and misinformation.  The way we respond to this epidemic sets a precedent for future health crises, and an example for our children.  <br/></p>

What are the Five Elements Meditations about?



By following the Five Elements guided meditation and visualisation, you will connect with the wisdom of our environment through the qualities of Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space. Observing the qualities of these elements, you can then understand your own body, mind and spirit, bringing you into harmony with your inner Nature.
Here are the qualities of the elements that you will connect with
 



Earth - Stability, Belonging & Centering
Water - Feeling, Potential & Balancing
Fire - Transformation, Radiance & Devotion 
Air - Inspiration, Vitality & Letting Go 
Space - Possibility, Freedom & Belief
Five Elements

They are a perfect complement to the yoga videos, and are wonderful to practice after (before or independent from) your yoga sequence.

<p>Zone DPMX measures your power (watts) and your cadence (rpm) as you ride, and sends the values wirelessly to your standard ANT+ bike computer for display and recording.    </p>
<p>Everything is on your shoes, and installation is as easy as fitting new cleats. There's nothing on the bike, not even a magnet, so you have your own power meter whatever bike you choose to ride.

<p>Under your shoe, in your Speedplay® Zero cleat, the special sensor plate measures force, and on top of your shoe the pod measures motion. The pod uses all this to calculate power (watts) and cadence (rpm).    </p>
<p>If you have a Zone DPMX Dual then the pods on each shoe talk to each other to calculate the total power and the left/right balance.

<p>Watch the Zone DPMX Dual in action in the video, measuring power (watts), cadence (rpm) and left/right power balance (%).
Values are sent wirelessly to a standard ANT+ bike computer for display and recording. You can see power and cadence reacting to the rider's efforts, and you can see power balance change when the rider unclips one shoe. Finally, you can see what happens when the Zone DPMX Dual is reduced to a Zone DPMX Single by removing one pod.  </p>

Wearable - Nothing on the bike.

Installation - As easy as fitting new cleats.

Affordable - Get value every time you ride, on any bike.

We've done all the research and development, we've done all the production preparation and planning, and now it's time to manufacture the first batch and deliver to you.
There are 2 versions of the power meter. 

Zone DPMX Single measures power on your left shoe only (upgradable to dual in the future).


Zone DPMX Dual measures power on both shoes.
















Do you wonder why you don't seem to be getting much better even though you ride long miles each week? There's a reason. Focused training will help, and for that you need to measure power.     

To perform better you must increase your power output. To increase power you must measure it.
Power measurement is proven to allow you to get more benefit in less training time. 
Next to competition results, power measurement is the best objective measure of riding fitness and improvement. Measures such as heart rate are not enough.
Power measurement is scientifically recognised as a critical part of training to be a better bike rider.

 Someone asked us why we worked so hard on the Zone DPMX power meter, and we thought you might be interested in a few of the reasons we put in our list of ""why?"":    

Because we can make a better power meter. 
Because measuring power is about the rider, not the bike.
Because people told us it couldn’t be done. 
Because we know it can be done.
Because we believe in doing things right, whatever it takes.

Because high technology products should “just work”.
Because great design looks simple.






Zone DPMX is available in two different versions: Single and Dual.    
Zone DPMX Single is fitted to your left shoe only, and measures power and cadence from your left foot. The power measured is automatically multiplied by 2 to give an estimate of the total power from both your feet. It is upgradable to the full dual-sided functionality. The upgrade is not yet available, but will be at some time in the future.






Zone DPMX Dual is fitted to both shoes. It measures total power, cadence, and left/right power balance to give you full accurate power measurement.    










Your Zone DPMX Single includes:    

A left side sensor plate & base. 
One pod. 
Charging dock, with room for two pods. 
USB wall charger, with international wall plugs. 
Torque screwdriver for correct tightening of cleat screws. 
Quick Start guide. 







Your Zone DPMX Dual includes:    

Two sensor plates & bases (left plus right). 
Two pods. 
Charging dock, with room for two pods. 
USB wall charger, with international wall plugs. 
Torque screwdriver for correct tightening of cleat screws. 
Quick Start guide. 











To use the Zone DPMX Single or the Zone DPMX Dual you must have the following:    

Speedplay® Zero pedals and cleats.
Shoes that have the standard 3-hole pattern for fixing cleats (Speedplay 4-hole pattern will not work).
Shoes that have at least one strap (shoes with only lacing will be difficult to fit).
An ANT+ compatible bike computer or smartphone that can receive and understand ANT+ power and cadence.











Installation is as simple as changing your cleats. When fitting your cleats to your shoes just use the Zone DPMX sensor plate instead of the Speedplay® black plastic adapter plate, and slide the Zone DPMX base onto your front shoe strap. You're done!    
It’s a simple swap – leave out the Speedplay adapter plates and use the Zone DPMX sensor plates instead. Moving the power meter to a new pair of shoes is just as easy. 

























We've put a lot of time and resources into getting the Zone DPMX to a finished design and preparing it for production, but we need your help to get it over the line and deliver it.    
Almost all the production tooling and samples are completed and tested. The electronic boards, the plastic enclosures, and the software are complete, and pre-production samples have been in test for more than a year. During that time a major focus of our work was on design improvements to the force sensor plate, and now we are working on some refinements to the production tooling and processes associated with that part of the power meter.
All product development and production preparation to date is fully paid for. Your contributions will be used to fund the final tooling adjustments, final production planning, and to manufacture your Zone DPMX power meter.",24.0,1,"1 Campaign

In many cases, the air inside people’s homes was worse than the air outside… but they had no way to know this, or what to do about it.   Ryan, is CEO at Brilliant & Company and has suffered from chronic allergic rhinitis since he was young. (That means he sneezes a lot.) Being personally affected by the effects of poor air quality was all Ryan needed to bring PiCO to life.  FAQQ. Where is PiCO developed and manufactured?A. PiCO was designed at HIT(Hanyang Institute of Technology) and manufactured in Seoul, South Korea.Q. Does PiCO require an external power supply?A. Yes. PiCO does not have an internal battery. It needs to be plugged into a smartphone, external battery, or an adapter of 5V 1A or lower connected by a USB cable.Q. Can a PiCO device be connected to multiple smartphones at the same time?A. No. A PiCO device can only be connected to one smartphone at a time. However, you can register other users on the same PiCO app and check what PiCO is picking up in real-time from anywhere.Q. Can I use the PiCO app without a PiCO device?A. Yes. Even without a PiCO device, you can still check air quality, weather information , and forecasts on the PiCO appQ. Can I use the PiCO anywhere in the world?A. Yes. PiCO connects to satellites and weather stations all around the world. This gives you the power to check air quality anywhere in the world at any time.Q. Does PiCO keep working even if the Bluetooth connection drops out?A. Yes. The sensor still works even if the Bluetooth is disconnected. PiCO will let you know what’s happening via the multicolored LED indicator on either side of the device.Q. The PM 2.5/10 levels measured through PiCO are different from the ones I can see online. Why?A. PiCO measures air quality in your immediate location in real time. So, the levels may differ from what you see online.Q. Can I use PiCO’s readings for medical purposes?A. No. The PiCO APP offers air quality information and well-being guides, but it is not a medical device. The PiCO device and app cannot be used for any diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of a disease or medical condition.Q. Is the PiCO app going to receive updates?A. Yes. The PiCO app is expected to be upgraded over time in order to maintain a high level of accuracy and usability for our backers.Q. Where does the other air quality and environmental information come from?A. This information comes from governmental institutions such as Korea Environment Corporation, and from global big-data service providers.Q. Can I use another USB cable other than the one included in the box?A. No. PiCO can only be powered through the provided USB cable. Every PiCO includes 3 Cables (C to C, C to micro-B, and C to Lightning).Q. I am using a phone that is not supported by OTG. Can I still use PiCO?A. You can still power PiCO with a power bank or through an adapter with a 1A to Type-C connection. What we’ve done before and where we’re going.Over the last two and a half years, it has been our first priority to develop products that create healthy living environments and arm people with the information to keep their family safe.Back in October 2016, we launched our first product ‘Akee’ a smart air quality monitor. We were stunned by its success as it was immediately snapped up by thousands of customers who share our vision.We’ve listened to feedback from the very beginning and are extremely excited to deliver PiCO. We’re aiming to ship PiCO worldwide in April this year. Risk & ChallengesWe’re confident that we will deliver a high quality device and are on track to do so according to our timeline. However, even the most well-planned campaigns can meet some unexpected speed bumps.As PiCO is powered by smartphones, those that don’t support OTG (On-The-Go) may have some trouble connecting. Since Apple’s change to lightning cables for iPhones and iPads, OTG is not an authorized Apple MFI process. Therefore power supply from Apple products may be unstable.Accurate measurements of ambient temperature and humidity require extensive debugging and testing, which may take some extra time to get right.The Android and iOS companion apps will be vigorously tested and upgraded to deliver an intuitive user experience. We’ll listen to feedback from users, and make adjustments accordingly. ShippingInternational backers: PiCO will ship worldwide. Please note that you will be responsible for duties, fees and taxes applicable to your region.Estimated delivery:  While we do not expect major issues, the estimated shipment date may shift a month or two. We will update backers as soon as ship dates are confirmed or if they change.Warranty: We stand firmly behind our products. Each PiCO includes a 7-day (after you receive it) money back guarantee, and a 1-year limited warranty.Support: Need help? If you have any questions, during or after the campaign has closed, you can reach us at cs@brilcom.comWe will continue working hard to ensure that we deliver our backers a low-risk, high-quality product on time.",42.0,0,"2 Campaigns
