Theatre Re creates an entrancing, poignant world and an hour spent in it seems
all too brief.”</i></b><b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Edinburgh Spotlight</i> on<i>
Blind Man’s Song</i></p>
<p><b>The Company</b></p>
<p>Established
in 2009, Theatre Re is a critically acclaimed London-based international ensemble
creating vibrant and emotional work on the edge of mime and theatre. Its
productions have toured nationally and internationally following sell-out
successes at the London International Mime Festival, Latitude and the Edinburgh
Fringe. </p>

<p><b></b></p><p><b>Support So Far</b></p><p>Funded by Arts Council England</p><p>Co-commissioned by the London International Mime Festival and South Hill Park Arts Centre</p><p>Supported by Shoreditch Town Hall, Jacksons Lane, The Point Easleigh, The Lincoln Drill Hall and Haringey Council.</p><p><b>What we want
to do:</b></p>
<p><i>« We all know that something is eternal.
And it ain’t houses and it ain’t names, and it ain’t earth, and it ain’t even
the stars... Everybody knows in their bones that something is eternal, and that
something has to do with human beings... There is something, way down deep
that’s eternal about every human being... And that’s what’s left when memory is
gone. » </i></p>
<p>This quote
from Thornton Wilder’s <i>Our Town</i>
alludes to what we want to portray through <i>The
Nature of Forgetting (working title)</i>. </p>
<p>To forget means
to be unable to remember. It implies the loss of accessibility to a memory,
however it does not necessarily mean that the information is lost. Through the
portrayal of one man’s inability to recollect his life, and building on recent
neurobiological discoveries and interviews, we are developing a visually stunning,
moving and intimate piece of theatre about what is left when memory is gone.</p>
<p>Following an
initial four-week rehearsal period across December 2015 and February 2016 in London at Shoredicth
Town Hall and at St Ann’s Library, <i>The Nature of Forgetting
(working title)</i> will be developed for another 3 weeks at Saint Ann’s
Library (London), Lincoln Drill Hall (Lincoln) and South Hill Park Arts
Centre (Bracknell) in June and July 2016.</p>
<p>Two work-in-progress
showcases will be organized at Lincoln Drill Hall on June 29<sup>th</sup> and at South
Hill Park Arts Centre on July 7<sup>th</sup>. We will also be organizing free
work-in-progress showings throughout the month of June (see our website for
more information). </p>
<p><b>How we are
working:</b></p>
<p>Neuroscience
research and understandings on memory and amnesia form the basis and foundation
of our explorations. We are also interviewing older members of the community as
well as people with dementia to create links between the research and real
human experiences.</p>
<p>Rather than
focusing on one person’s real story, we are fusing together multiple facts,
narrative and non-narrative elements. It is from their connections and
interactions that an intimate, powerful and visceral piece will emerge. </p>
<p>This work is
supported by Jacksons Lane’s participation department, Haringey Council, the
Alzheimer’s Society, the Haringey Memory Service, HAIL Mental Health Support
Association, Haringey Older People’s Forum and University College London.</p>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>Now that we
have established links with supporters of the project, developed a timeline, appointed
a strong team and started the devising process, we are seeking a little help
from you to complete our budget. </p>
<p>Donations
will contribute towards the costs of costumes, props, set, transportation and
artistic fees.</p>

Theatre Re creates an entrancing, poignant world and an hour spent in it seems
all too brief.” 

Edinburgh Spotlight on
Blind Man’s Song
The Company
Established
in 2009, Theatre Re is a critically acclaimed London-based international ensemble
creating vibrant and emotional work on the edge of mime and theatre. Its
productions have toured nationally and internationally following sell-out
successes at the London International Mime Festival, Latitude and the Edinburgh
Fringe.

Support So FarFunded by Arts Council EnglandCo-commissioned by the London International Mime Festival and South Hill Park Arts CentreSupported by Shoreditch Town Hall, Jacksons Lane, The Point Easleigh, The Lincoln Drill Hall and Haringey Council.What we want
to do:
« We all know that something is eternal.
And it ain’t houses and it ain’t names, and it ain’t earth, and it ain’t even
the stars... Everybody knows in their bones that something is eternal, and that
something has to do with human beings... There is something, way down deep
that’s eternal about every human being... And that’s what’s left when memory is
gone. » 
This quote
from Thornton Wilder’s Our Town
alludes to what we want to portray through The
Nature of Forgetting (working title). 
To forget means
to be unable to remember. It implies the loss of accessibility to a memory,
however it does not necessarily mean that the information is lost. Through the
portrayal of one man’s inability to recollect his life, and building on recent
neurobiological discoveries and interviews, we are developing a visually stunning,
moving and intimate piece of theatre about what is left when memory is gone.
Following an
initial four-week rehearsal period across December 2015 and February 2016 in London at Shoredicth
Town Hall and at St Ann’s Library, The Nature of Forgetting
(working title) will be developed for another 3 weeks at Saint Ann’s
Library (London), Lincoln Drill Hall (Lincoln) and South Hill Park Arts
Centre (Bracknell) in June and July 2016.
Two work-in-progress
showcases will be organized at Lincoln Drill Hall on June 29th and at South
Hill Park Arts Centre on July 7th. We will also be organizing free
work-in-progress showings throughout the month of June (see our website for
more information). 
How we are
working:
Neuroscience
research and understandings on memory and amnesia form the basis and foundation
of our explorations. We are also interviewing older members of the community as
well as people with dementia to create links between the research and real
human experiences.
Rather than
focusing on one person’s real story, we are fusing together multiple facts,
narrative and non-narrative elements. It is from their connections and
interactions that an intimate, powerful and visceral piece will emerge. 
This work is
supported by Jacksons Lane’s participation department, Haringey Council, the
Alzheimer’s Society, the Haringey Memory Service, HAIL Mental Health Support
Association, Haringey Older People’s Forum and University College London.
What We Need
Now that we
have established links with supporters of the project, developed a timeline, appointed
a strong team and started the devising process, we are seeking a little help
from you to complete our budget. 
Donations
will contribute towards the costs of costumes, props, set, transportation and
artistic fees.

Two ghostly performers. One thrilling night. On an Autumn evening in 2015, two friends told a ghost story to 1,500 people in a dimly-lit church in the centre of Leeds. Now, after a tour to libraries, arts spaces and theatres, Adam and Ben are going back on the road with their thrilling tales and haunting violin accompaniment.WATCH our show trailer: https://youtu.be/K09MROlwVH0 Who Are We?We are Adam Z. Robinson and Ben Styles, Storyteller and Musician, and we need your help to make our tour a success. We've been working together on our ghost story shows for a couple of years and we've been thrilled with the response we've received. In fact, it's the kind comments, support and reception from audiences which have pushed us to take the show out for a second tour. This time, everything is under our own steam. It's a huge challenge - but we really want to bring our creepy tales to new venues, towns and audiences. The TourSpanning 3 months the tour will take us to 22 theatres up and down the country. We've already announced the following dates: Ropery Hall, Barton-upon-Humber (21 Oct), Century Theatre, Coalville (28 Oct), Shelley Theatre, Boscombe (2 Nov), Margate Theatre Royal (4 Nov). But there are many more due to be announced soon. Getting the Show on the RoadWe need your help! Taking the show to all of these different venues, across all of these different dates, has many costs.Your gift - however large or small - will help us with: vehicle hire for the tour, putting petrol in the van, hiring technicians, accommodation, equipment hire and marketing costs. Our IndieGoGo target is just a fraction of what we need to raise - but it will make a huge difference. We'd be so grateful if you would consider supporting us. The New ShowWe're currently working on a brand new set of stories - a brand new Book of Darkness & Light show! We're working in association with Square Chapel Arts Centre and Harrogate Theatre. We really want to bring the new stories to some of the libraries we played at last year. These library shows will be on a Pay What You Decide basis - making them available to everyone. We can only do these shows with your help.Ghost Story Writing Workshops Adam is looking into running a course of ghost story writing workshops. This is a big project and requires lots of time and dedication. But, it's something we really want to do. Again, we need your help to achieve this! (This is one of our 'stretch goals' if we exceed our target). Our TargetOur IndieGoGo target is only a small fraction of what we need to raise in order to do all of the things we'd like to. But getting your donations will make a big difference. We hope you will consider supporting us. RewardsAny donations, large or small, would be appreciated immensely. We have a fantastic list of rewards – our original violin soundtrack, unique horror haikus, signed posters and scripts and even a live performance of the show in a venue of your choosing (ghost stories in your living room, anyone?). These are our way to say thank you for whatever you can give. The Book of Darkness & Light Team:Adam Z. RobinsonWriter and The Storyteller in The Book of Darkness & Light. The first horror movie Adam ever saw was Silver Bullet. He was both terrified and hooked from that moment. Today, his favourite scary movies are The Exorcist, The Wicker Man and The Blair Witch Project. He is obsessed with M.R. James and pretty much all ghost story writers.Ben StylesViolinist, composer and The Musician in The Book of Darkness & Light. Ben saw The Mummy when he was 12 and did not like it one bit. In the past few years though he has rediscovered horror and particularly likes the surreal ghost stories of E.F. Benson.Dick BonhamProducer (LittleMighty) and Dramaturg for The Book of Darkness & Light. Dick is a massive fan of classic Hammer Horror films, with his favourite being Plague of the Zombies and Quatermass and the Pit. He is a big fan of gothic literature, with his favourites including Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House. Stretch goalsIf this campaign does well and we exceed our target, the extra funds will go towards:- A course of creative writing workshops - Library shows: The brand new show will be taken to various libraries on a Pay What You Decide basis. - Further marketing, to make sure we fill every venue.- More stories and tours going beyond 2017/18.Risks and challengesThe main risk is that we struggle to pay for the travel to each venue, accommodation for all of the dates and can't afford technical staff members for certain dates. Plus, there is some extra equipment we'd like to hire for bigger auditoria in order to deliver the best show possible. The other risk we can foresee is that we don’t secure the audience sizes we are expecting. We feel that this is unlikely – our proposition of a thrilling ghost story with live music in an unusual venue is one that people seem to get behind – but it is a possibility.We will put everything we can into marketing the show and, as mentioned above, any extra we might raise from this campaign will go towards making sure people know about the events.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h2>G.L.O.R.Y. is back!</h2>
<p>Hello again friends! The Glorious Ladies of Rasslin, Y'all are back for a second show and we hope you are all as excited as we are! Thanks to your contributions to our first IndieGoGo this past spring, we were able to accomplish an incredible feat: turning our rag-tag concept of an amateur all-female and non-binary theatrical wrestling league into a reality with our first show, Plague of Blood 1.0.</p>
<p>We put our bleeding hearts and four months of intense work into something nobody had done before, inside a little golden ring we built ourselves. We didn’t know how it would land. We weren’t sure if it would go over. But we put our faith in each other and in ourselves and we were rewarded with THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER. It happened because you believed in us.</p>
<p>GLORY wants to continue to bring you our very best. GLORY is a performance project run by students and artists who dedicate their time to training for our shows. While our time is incredibly valuable, it unfortunately does not bankroll production costs for the show. Our goal is to better ourselves with each show, and with your IGG donations we will accomplish AN INSANE EXPLOSION OF FEMALE BLOODSPORT FOR YOUR THIRSTY EYES AND EMPTY HEARTS TO DRINK!</p>
<p>Last IGG we spoke about why GLORY was important. Why this form of wrestling needed a place in this sport. With our first show under our belts, we can say without a shadow of a doubt how satisfying it was for our performers, many of whom had limited or no wrestling or performance experience before that show, and legitimately how much fun we and the crowd had doing this!</p>
<p>If you came to the show last time, THANK YOU. Thank you for telling your friends about us. Supporting GLORY is not limited to your financial contributions alone. Coming up to us and telling us how much you love GLORY is support. Liking our posts on Facebook is support.

<h2>Our Budget</h2>
<h3>Short Term</h3>
<p>Our show budget is a list of our bare-bones budget for our upcoming show. These are the minimal expenses needed to make this show run. We are adamant about paying our performers, and performer/artist/tech crew payout is our largest expense. The rest is production cost, including compensation for the hours of teaching and organizing that go into our show.</p>
<p>Show budget:</p>
<p>$3000 - performer, artist, and tech crew payout</p>
<p>$900 - new merchandise</p>
<p>$500 - ring repairs and updates</p>
<p>$200 - training</p>
<p>$400 - organization and management</p>
<p>$300 - props and costumes</p>
<p>$100 - ring transportation</p>
<p>$100 - A/V rentals</p>
<p>$200 - folding chairs</p>
<p>(Subtotal: $5,700)</p>
<h3>Long Term</h3>
<p>Many of the moves we are able to do are limited (due to safety precautions) in our current ring. While our updates ensure optimal safety for our performers, it does not allow us to do some of the more dazzling moves that we could do. This is why we have made it our long term goal to buy a professional wrestling ring that will allow our performers to run their matches in future shows to the fullest extent of their imaginations. It’s a big expense, but we think it is attainable within the next year. There will be no losers in this new world. A real wrestling ring will be a win for everyone!</p>
<p>Long term expenses:</p>
<p>$5000 - new ring</p>
<p>$1000 - ring storage</p>
<p>(Subtotal: $6,000)</p>
<h3>Total budget: $11,700</h3> <p>The $2,800 we ask for today only represents a small portion of our budget, but it is enough to cover our production costs and ensure that our show will happen. The additional money that we need to pay our performers, artists, and tech crew will come from ticket and merch sales. Any extra money we make on our IndieGoGo will go towards paying our performers, and combined with our ticket and merch sales, all extra money after performer payout will be budgeted towards our long term goal of buying a ring!</p>

Hi, I'm A.J. Brockman, co founder and curator of The Brewhouse Gallery, Lake Park, Florida's only art, coffee and craft beer experience and the driving force behind our campaign to revitalize the Kelsey Theater; Reviving an entire community!


What was once a successful indie film house and rock music venue will become an independently run, community-based, theater that focuses on bringing culture to the surrounding areas through film, music and the performing arts.
While Palm Beach County is known for its affluent theaters our venue will make such events a lot more accessible to a community that is less likely to attend stuffy art shows with expensive admissions.

<p>Project: Humanity asks for your
support to present a production of <i>Audio Guides </i>featuring new
work by Catherine Murray, with invited work by Andrea Spaziani and Christy
Stoeten.</p>
<p>Catherine, Christy &amp; Andy
realized that they all had work where sound and language were integral to the
audience's experience and interaction with the piece. We decided to bring these
three works together around the concept of <i>Audio Guides</i>. We'd love
to have your support to help make this production happen.</p>
<h3><b> The Three Works</b></h3>
<p><i><b>/vərˈbādəm/</b> - </i>Concept and Choreography by Catherine Murray. Created and Performed by Andrea Spaziani, Denise Solleza, and Christy Stoeten. <br/></p>
<blockquote>
<i><i>""/vərˈbādəm/ </i></i>centres on how dance, language, and personal experience
interact, intersect, and inform each other. Beginning with interview
transcripts that I personally conducted, dancers physically represent the
conversations by applying a verbatim framework to their
""translation."" The work explores the opportunity for verbatim text,
verbatim movement, and a voice to exist in the same space, attempting to
maintain the integrity of all three of these forms which are dependent upon,
and derived from, each other.""</blockquote>
<p><i><b>Rafters</b> - </i>Concept by Andrea Spaziani. Created and Performed in collaboration with Alicia Grant, Julia Male, and Andrea Spaziani. <br/></p>
<blockquote>""Rafters is influence in motion. It flushes out the unconscious, and
projects it across a femme triad. It is set to an audio collage of ‘self-talk’
made from words that have emerged through movement, are completely personal,
and are also perhaps untrue. The words are the linguistic result of twittering
gestural squirms pushed out from deep subliminal tripping. Their influence is
mysterious, and they point towards a communication beyond inscription. The
performers interact with the audio collage, and each other, floating in and out
of a network of influence. This entanglement becomes the material, and the room
becomes a space of charged interconnectivity. This dance attunes to the
information between words, bodies, and their surroundings.""</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>Until Tender-Crisp III</b> </i>- Created and Performed by Christy Stoeten. This work was created with the support of the Toronto Arts Council and the Series <span>8:08</span> Creators Space Residency, 2013/2014.<br/></p>
<blockquote>""Until Tender-Crisp III asks how does seeing something over and over again change it, or our relationship to it? How do our memories shape our present? And how does our present skew our past? This work explores themes that are grounded in daily life experiences, investigating humour in the everyday, and seeking beauty in the mundane. 'It makes me realize that the wool has been pulled over my eyes for years with the whole Wizard of Oz, Dark Side of the Moon rigamarole.' Michelle Rhodes.""</blockquote>
<h3><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3>
<p><i>Audio Guides </i>will be presented at The Citadel from March 3 - 5, 2016.
This show will feature three separate dance works that are performed by 5
professional dancers, plus choreographers, a stage manager, a lighting
designer, and a sound editor working behind the scenes. This fundraising helps
us make this production possible.</p>
<p>$3000 might not seem like a lot but
it covers almost everything we need to make this production happen.
The money we raise will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>renting the Citadel for our three shows plus some
     rehearsal time;</li>
<li>remunerating the dancers, our stage manager, and our
     lighting designer; </li>
<li>renting sound equipment;</li>
<li>providing some refreshments to our audience members at
     the shows.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don’t reach our entire goal,
whatever you’ve generously donated will go directly into covering as many of
the above costs as we can. Every dime counts and every dime helps. We hope that
our perks are enough to entice you to give
whatever you can. </p>
<h3><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></h3>
<p>We completely understand if you
can’t make a financial donation. But there are other ways to help <i>Audio
Guides</i>.</p>
<p>1. Please let all your friends and
family know about this Indiegogo campaign. Tweet about it. Facebook about it.
Email away. Use the Indiegogo share tools and help us spread the word.</p>
<p>2. If you’re a Toronto business
owner and you’d like to get involved in some way – whether it be sponsorship
for an ad in our program, or a donation of in-kind services, please get in

<h4><b>Who is Project: Humanity?</b></h4>
<p>Project: Humanity (PH) is a
Toronto-based non-profit raising social awareness through the arts. Founded by
theatre/dance professionals, the company has used drama to foster more
understanding and empathy between marginalized groups and the
community-at-large – locally in Toronto, provincially and nationally. The
company is committed to creating original, socially-minded theatre and dance
while maintaining a strong and ongoing community outreach mandate – with a
particular emphasis on young people. Previous community partners include
Jessie’s (the June Callwood Centre for Young Women), Covenant House Shelter,
and most frequently, Youth Without Shelter (YWS).</p>

</div></div>","Project: Humanity asks for your
support to present a production of Audio Guides featuring new
work by Catherine Murray, with invited work by Andrea Spaziani and Christy
Stoeten.
Catherine, Christy & Andy
realized that they all had work where sound and language were integral to the
audience's experience and interaction with the piece. We decided to bring these
three works together around the concept of Audio Guides. We'd love
to have your support to help make this production happen.
 The Three Works
/vərˈbādəm/ - Concept and Choreography by Catherine Murray. Created and Performed by Andrea Spaziani, Denise Solleza, and Christy Stoeten. 

""/vərˈbādəm/ centres on how dance, language, and personal experience
interact, intersect, and inform each other. Beginning with interview
transcripts that I personally conducted, dancers physically represent the
conversations by applying a verbatim framework to their
""translation."" The work explores the opportunity for verbatim text,
verbatim movement, and a voice to exist in the same space, attempting to
maintain the integrity of all three of these forms which are dependent upon,
and derived from, each other.""
Rafters - Concept by Andrea Spaziani. Created and Performed in collaboration with Alicia Grant, Julia Male, and Andrea Spaziani. 
""Rafters is influence in motion. It flushes out the unconscious, and
projects it across a femme triad. It is set to an audio collage of ‘self-talk’
made from words that have emerged through movement, are completely personal,
and are also perhaps untrue. The words are the linguistic result of twittering
gestural squirms pushed out from deep subliminal tripping. Their influence is
mysterious, and they point towards a communication beyond inscription. The
performers interact with the audio collage, and each other, floating in and out
of a network of influence. This entanglement becomes the material, and the room
becomes a space of charged interconnectivity. This dance attunes to the
information between words, bodies, and their surroundings.""

Until Tender-Crisp III - Created and Performed by Christy Stoeten. This work was created with the support of the Toronto Arts Council and the Series 8:08 Creators Space Residency, 2013/2014.
""Until Tender-Crisp III asks how does seeing something over and over again change it, or our relationship to it? How do our memories shape our present? And how does our present skew our past? This work explores themes that are grounded in daily life experiences, investigating humour in the everyday, and seeking beauty in the mundane. 'It makes me realize that the wool has been pulled over my eyes for years with the whole Wizard of Oz, Dark Side of the Moon rigamarole.' Michelle Rhodes.""
What
We Need & What You Get
Audio Guides will be presented at The Citadel from March 3 - 5, 2016.
This show will feature three separate dance works that are performed by 5
professional dancers, plus choreographers, a stage manager, a lighting
designer, and a sound editor working behind the scenes. This fundraising helps
us make this production possible.
$3000 might not seem like a lot but
it covers almost everything we need to make this production happen.
The money we raise will go towards:

renting the Citadel for our three shows plus some
     rehearsal time;
remunerating the dancers, our stage manager, and our
     lighting designer; 
renting sound equipment;
providing some refreshments to our audience members at
     the shows.

If we don’t reach our entire goal,
whatever you’ve generously donated will go directly into covering as many of
the above costs as we can. Every dime counts and every dime helps. We hope that
our perks are enough to entice you to give
whatever you can. 
Other
Ways You Can Help
We completely understand if you
can’t make a financial donation. But there are other ways to help Audio
Guides.
1. Please let all your friends and
family know about this Indiegogo campaign. Tweet about it. Facebook about it.
Email away. Use the Indiegogo share tools and help us spread the word.
2. If you’re a Toronto business
owner and you’d like to get involved in some way – whether it be sponsorship
for an ad in our program, or a donation of in-kind services, please get in
touch with us at catherine@projecthumanity.ca

<h3><b>The
Basics:</b></h3>
<p>Hello! Thanks for taking a look at our crowdfunding page! We are Emily Nicholl and Ben Collis, and we are acrobats from
Edinburgh, Scotland. You may have seen us training, teaching and
performing around Edinburgh, the UK and Europe.</p>
<p>In
order to take our skills to the next level, and represent Scotland at
the top level of contemporary Circus around the world, we are going
to train at Flic Circus School in Torino, Italy. We start on the 28th
September 2013. 
</p>
<p>
We
would love it if you could make this possible for us! Any money you
donate will contribute directly to our development as circus
professionals, and enable us to give more back to the circus
community in Scotland.</p>

About

Torino
 is a beautiful and historic city in North-Western Italy, right at
the foot of the Alps. But most importantly it is home to Flic Circus
School, a high level contemporary circus preparation and finishing
school, and member of the European Federation of Professional Circus
Schools (FEDEC)</p>
<p>We
have chosen Flic (and feel honoured to have been accepted on their
course) because of its reputation for technical training alongside
theatre and creation, its excellent acrobatics training and  top
level teachers and artistic directors.  Throughout the course
students put on monthly free performances in order to gain
performance experience, try out new ideas, get audience feedback and
provide free performances to the local community.  It has an
incredible atmosphere, offering a disciplined and challenging
education, whilst emphasising creativity, support and community
between students and teachers.

<h3><b>The

<p>We
are asking for donations to help cover our tuition fees, which are

<p>For
full time circus training at a renowned professional circus school,
we feel this to be extremely reasonable. We will gain invaluable
experience and connections, broadening our network of contacts and
friends within the European circus community. It is a full time
course, with training 5 days a week and monthly performances and
monthly specialised workshops from visiting teachers, so we will also
gain skills that we could not achieve otherwise. We estimate it will
cost us a total of £7000 each to complete a year at Flic. 
</p>
<p>We
have been working hard to get the money together to live for a year
whilst studying full-time in Italy. We have been teaching workshops,
performing, doing odd jobs and selling all our possessions! We are
extremely appreciative of any donations or words of support, and
promise to be totally responsible with your generosity and only ever
spend your donations on our circus development.

<p>We
have created a series of rewards that we hope will mean something to
you, from a big heartfelt thank you for changing our lives, to a
unique piece of acrobatic artwork, to workshops and your very own
personalised performance.</p>

<h3><b>Giving
back:</b></h3>
<p>We
have a real passion for our home grown circus community and for the
power that circus has to change peoples lives.  We will become strong
physical performers at the highest level of technical circus ability,
and create innovative, original and inspiring circus. We look forward
to collaborating across art forms and creating exchanges between
Italy and Scotland. We believe that skills should be shared and so we
will spread our new skills and techniques as far as we can, around
the world and in our Scottish circus community through teaching and
training as well as performance.

<h3><b>Our
Bio:</b></h3>
<p>We
have been training acrobatics together for two and a half years. We
are both Edinburgh based but find ourselves all over the UK and
Europe on a regular basis. Our training started with the brilliant
skill sharing acrobalance/dance/circus community in Edinburgh and has
since included European Acro Conventions, NoFitState Circus, Conflux,
Luxe, Mimbre, Wybren Wouda, Fons Bennnk, Vertigo Circus School, Flic
Circus School, Angela de Castro, Wired Aerial Theatre, tePOOKa and
Beltane Fire Society. We have performed in numerous contexts
including at NoFitState Circus, MintFest, Chatsworth House and most
notably at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival</p>
<p>Ben
has been training in partner acrobatics and hand to hand for 5 years
He also trains in solo acrobatics and dance. In performances he
always aims to be creative and original, with every movement telling
a story. Ben originally experienced acro at the very first Edinburgh
Aerial and Acro Convention in 2008, and has been addicted ever since.
He is probably thinking about acrobatics right now...</p>
<p>Exploring
performance and political theatre whilst working in environmental
education with young people, Emily became inspired by circus and
physical theatre as a means to merge them all together. She began
training partner acrobatics in 2011. Having recently finished a year
as a trainee performer with NoFitState Circus, she now focuses on
hand to hand, acro-dance and solo handstands. She is a passionate
teacher and learner, inspired by the challenging yet empowering
nature of partner acrobatics. She also has a growing interest in
rigging for circus performance and is often found enjoying scaring
herself whilst rock climbing.</p>

I mean, it's beautiful! It's really beautiful, the way that this show imagines a Trump presidency through the lens of Aaron Sorkin's seminal political drama, THE WEST WING. It's really something else.We're gonna do a lot of great things with this show. We've got a great cast and crew, they're wonderful, wonderful people. They really understand what we need to do to make this country great again (for example, supporting and participating in local theater).
And we are completely self-funding the show. We're not taking any money from the Super PACs that have supported so many other failed shows over the years. (Bad!) We are completely self-funding, all by ourselves, and we would like for you to help us completely self-fund the show with a small donation to help cover the festival fees and marketing costs.
So do us a favor, help us out if you can, and this July, come see us Make Fringe Great Again. (Even though Fringe is already Great.)

<p>            Hi, I'm Alex Hersler, the writer/producer of Algorithmism, which will have its world premiere at the 20th annual New York International Fringe Festival this August. I’m super excited because this is going to be the first production of a full length play of mine, but I need your help to actually bring the production to life!</p>
<h3>Is Creativity Uniquely Human?</h3>
<p>            We’re living through a seismic shift in the structure of society. Artificial Intelligence is getting smarter and more complex every day, and it is already <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUYcTuZJpM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">beginning to rival some of the intellectual capabilities of humans.</a> But when it comes to making art, is the process ultimately describable in its totality by algorithms and neural networks, or is there something baked into the concept of creativity that makes it impossible for AI to rival a human artist?</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why do we respond to art? And why do we respond to art differently when we know it’s made by a machine?</strong></p>
<p>            These are questions that are going to help shape the way we design AI. And they are questions that are going to help inform our relationship with art. As the intersection of art and technology grows and evolves, I think it’s very important that we ask ourselves: why do we want machines creating art? I believe that any work today that is a part of the conversation about our relationship with AI is going to help us move into our future more fully equipped.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>With your help, we can bring this important topic to the New York stage!</strong></p>
<p>           This play is about two men who have become emotionally intertwined over a ten year relationship, and who discover how desperately they need the other to appreciate their true value in the world. Paul, a famous painter whose immediacy in the art world is fading, champions human-made art, while his agent, Tom, whose reputation for having excellent taste is growing, champions the inclusion of machine-made art. The two find themselves on opposite sides of history after the world learns that a machine is autonomously making art that is commanding top-tier prices.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>            Ultimately, the play is a fast-paced tale about art and AI that unfolds as an explosive power struggle between two characters who are super fun to watch.</strong></p>
<h3>Where I'm Coming From</h3>
<p>           I moved to New York in early 2014 from Oakland, CA to refocus my life around theatre and specifically around playwriting. I studied theater, philosophy and creative writing at Northwestern University, where I first got excited about the synthesis of big ideas and live performance.</p>
<p>            I initially got turned on to the intricacies and existential questions surrounding the trajectory of artificial intelligence through a <a href=""http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">post on the blog waitbutwhy</a>. The topic of AI is hugely multi-faceted and I find its implications deeply inspiring. I wrote this play as a part of a much larger conversation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>And your support will help drive this conversation forward!</strong></p>
<h3>The Nuts and Bolts</h3>
<p>I'm asking for $6000, which is going to go directly toward funding the hard costs of the production. Here's a breakdown of how the funding is going to be used:</p>
<p>Actor/Designer/Production Team Stipends - $2700<br/>Set/Props - $300<br/>Costumes - $200<br/>Rehearsal Space - $600<br/>Marketing Materials - $700<br/>Publicity - $700<br/>Insurance - $400<br/>Copy costs (several drafts of play) - $250<br/>Travel Reimbursement - $175<br/>Playbills - $300<br/>Fringe Participation Fee - $700<br/>Venue Director Tip - $100</p>
<p>=$7125. I plan to recoup the difference through ticket sales.</p>

are on sale now at www.NotManApart.com 


AJAX in IRAQ Los Angeles Premiere - The Company, The Play, The Idea.         
 The LOS ANGELES PREMIERE of AJAX IN IRAQ will be the 2014 Season Opener for Not Man Apart. AJAX IN IRAQ is an important, timely and powerful piece of theatre written by Award-Winning Playwright Ellen Mclaughlin. 

At the forefront, the play tells the story of the many female combatants in the U.S. Armed Services that are subjected to intense physical sexual abuse, but remain quiet, intertwined with the parable story of the great warrior Ajax, which is said to be one of the first and oldest stories to openly portray the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder.
•               Stories like this can only be told through the generosity of Arts minded individuals such as yourself. We have no Endowment, nor Grants to tell this tale. Since the beginning of Theatre itself, the Performing Arts have relied on generous support from those who deeply care that important stories and experiences of our world be told. Those who understand the vital connection that entertainment has with enlightenment. This is a subject matter best brought to our attention in a visual, visceral, immediate way that highlights the new and ancient parts of our daily struggles and social injustices. The magnitude and gratification of having this piece of art come to life at this time, with this theatre company, in this city will be felt by all those that give a little part of themselves to have this become a reality. Not Man Apart - Physical Theatre Ensemble is a collective of multi-disciplined performing artists whose Mission Statement is TO GENERATE INNOVATIVE PHYSICAL WORKS OF THEATRE, CONTRIBUTING EDUCATIONAL AND TRANSFORMATIONAL EXPERIENCES. Est. 2007
•                The Company's Vision Statement is - 
TO BRING the Worlds of Dance and Theatre closer together, while honoring the power of the spoken word.  
TO REEXAMINE the Classics of Literature and our everyday World through a Visceral interpretation.  
TO CREATE Highly Athletic and Innovative Theatrical Events, which are Life-Affirming and consciousness expanding.
TO ELEVATE the Theatrical Experience to rival the excitement of Live Sports Events, and the Elegance and Intimacy of Dance.  TO ESTABLISH a new kind of Physical Theatre Genre that is Inclusive, Relevant, Accessible, Exciting and Ineffable. •               
 
Our Goal & Where Your Contribution Goes - 


•               It can be a very expensive gesture these days to produce a play. Even if all the performers, choreographers and director donate their work for no pay, as is the case here, it still takes a great deal of money to produce and promote a piece of work. We need a minimum of $12,500 to produce this play - with quite nearly a volunteer core of artists. We then hope to raise whatever deficit we incur through ticket sales. 
We do this because we think these stories are important to tell, because we are passionate about making them in this medium, and finally because the shared experience with the audience is profound and potent. 


•                We have a great deal to share with you and many great perks that will make the shared experience of this project felt deeply by all those that give a piece of themselves to it. 


•                If we are able to raise our entire goal we will be able to pay for the space, the posters, the programs, the costumes, the props, the advertising, the promotion, the technical crew, the many designers, the set, and the royalties to do this play.


 
Other Ways You Can Help -

disciplines, a creative outlet for choreographers, and performance
opportunities for adult dancers in the Washington, D.C. area. </p>
<p>Through her dedicated outreach, Abby is on the verge of
creating a dynamic performance company comprised of local dancers with diverse
backgrounds and expertise.  We aim to
celebrate dance by making it accessible to the community through public
performances, community events, and collaborations with other artists.</p><p><b>Who We Are</b></p><p></p>Abby brings 30 years of dance experience to Allure Dance DC. Training in classical ballet, pointe, modern, jazz &amp; tap at the Metropolitan Ballet Theater and prestigious University of Arizona school of Dance, her credits include 7-time NFL Cheerleader, captain, choreographer and 2012 NFL Pro Bowl Cheerleader. She performed four years with a professional dance company in Washington, D.C., gracing the stage of the Lincoln Theater. She's danced professionally in Hong Kong, India &amp; Europe and travelled on 12 Military Appreciation Tours all over the world, including four times to combat zones in Afghanistan &amp; Iraq. <p><br/></p><p>Read more about our instructors here: <a href=""http://abbydymond.wix.com/alluredancedc#!instructors/c2215"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Allure Dance DC Instructor Bios</a><br/></p><p></p><p>Allure started as an emerging dance studio and the performance company is comprised of dancers of <i>all
levels – from beginners to exceptionally talented advanced dancers.</i> What
brings us all together is our shared love of dance. Many of our performance
company members, and instructors, are former ballet studio kids, competition dancers, college dance team members, NFL cheerleaders, NHL
&amp; NBA dancers, and dance teachers looking for other avenues to continue dancing and performing. <br/></p>
<p><b>Our Growth</b></p><p>We produced three performances in 2013; each time growing in

training in various styles and dancing numerous pieces. The end result is a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary performance on a live stage with music, lights and costumes! This is an opportunity
to not only showcase the hard work and dedication of the previous 13 weeks, but
to tell a story through our movement and passion.</p>

This summer, we have a full-time staff of 7 mounting a fully-realized musical with twenty teens from every part of the zone. The teens we work with LOVE to sing, dance and act. But they don't have very many opportunities to participate in the arts in the small mountain town where they live. They look forward all year to participating in the musical, and every year new kids join in.

<p>‘Our Island’ deals with contemporary and

<p>It is a play that looks at what happens after

relationships. How do people adjust to life after May 22nd, to a new world with
the same old questions? How do we judge each other's decisions and how do they
reflect on our own choices? How do we bridge that gap between an old home and a
new life?</p><p>'Our Island' will be performed in the Tiger Dublin Fringe Festival, September 2015.</p>

<p><b>Barry McStay</b> is an Irish

<p>Director <b>Maisie Lee </b>is Artistic

</p><p><b><span>Why do we need your support.</span></b></p>
<p>In producing ‘Our Island’ we want to stand up,

world. This feels like an important play for today’s changing world. For
today's changing Ireland.</p>
<p>In order for us to make this production happen
we need your help:

</p><ul>
<li><span>We want to pay all actors and
     designers a fair fee, that values their work, time and artistic impact on
     the production</span></li>
<li>We need to build a set, make

<li>The goal is to raise €5000,
     this money will not cover all the costs but will be an important and
     valuable contribution </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p><b><span>The Impact</span></b></p>
<p>Making
a new play a reality in today's world is a challenging process. It takes so
much more than a great idea, a fantastic creative team, passion and ambition.
It takes resources, and more and more in recent times, it takes the good will
of friends, family and people who believe in your idea.<br/>
We believe that 'Our Island' is touching on very timely and current issues in
our society, and asks questions that many people can relate to.<br/>
By supporting this production, you will directly impact on making our idea a
reality and become a part of the 'Our Island'-family. A relationship that will
hopefully last.</p>

We have over 30 students of various ages, mobility and wellness levels. Health and Wellness is near and dear to my heart because, through diet and exercise, I have lost over 300 pounds in the last 3 years.

Exercise is an essential component of achieving and maintaining wellness, but it can be a chore. That’s why it’s so important to find ways to exercise that are fun, challenging and rewarding.

I am truly thankful that, A Place For Miracles LV was made available to me to have our dance classes, but the room we use is carpeted and challenging to dance on.

Now we are dreaming of the possibilities having a “real” dance floor can bring to us. We can hold other types of dance lessons and exercise classes, as well.

<p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Hello Everyone, My name is Malcolm Low and I am the artistic director of my NYC based company Malcolm Low/Formal Structure. I have been showcasing my work in NYC since 1999. I have recently been blessed with the opportunity to showcase my work as part of the 2011-2012 Joyce Soho Season. I will be premiering my newest work ""Collapsing Giant"" a work that takes a look into what is reality and the world in which we live
in the context of what we do while we are here 
(i.e. love , gain knowledge, 
war and death.) I will be working in collaboration with lighting and set designer, Gregory Bain, and seven beautiful dancers. With big opportunity comes big expenses and this is where your generous support is most needed. Please help us bring <span style=""font-style: italic; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Collapsing Giant</span> into fruition at the Joyce Soho March 2nd and 3rd.<br/></p>
<p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><br/></p>
<p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Here is a brief biography:</p>
<p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""> <br/>
   Malcolm Low is a participant in the 2011 Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation
 New Directions Choreography Lab made possible by generous support from 
the Ford Foundation. Mr. Low is orginally from Chicago where he first 
trained with Joseph Holmes Chicago, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, Homer 
Bryyant and the Ruth Page Foundation. Low went on to perform with Joseph
 Holmes Chicago Dance Co., Les Ballets J<span class=""text_exposed_show""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">azz
 de Montreal, Ballet British Columbia, Ronald K. Brown/Evidence, Stephen
 Peternio, Complexions, Zvi Gotheneir and Dancers, Margo Sappington and 
most notably the Bill T. Jones/ Arnie Zane Dance Co., where he had the 
great pleasure of touring with Bill T. Jones on his solo show As I Was 
Saying. Recently, he has been working with Crystal Pite and her company

</div></div>","Our Story
Hello Everyone, My name is Malcolm Low and I am the artistic director of my NYC based company Malcolm Low/Formal Structure. I have been showcasing my work in NYC since 1999. I have recently been blessed with the opportunity to showcase my work as part of the 2011-2012 Joyce Soho Season. I will be premiering my newest work ""Collapsing Giant"" a work that takes a look into what is reality and the world in which we live
in the context of what we do while we are here 
(i.e. love , gain knowledge, 
war and death.) I will be working in collaboration with lighting and set designer, Gregory Bain, and seven beautiful dancers. With big opportunity comes big expenses and this is where your generous support is most needed. Please help us bring Collapsing Giant into fruition at the Joyce Soho March 2nd and 3rd.

Here is a brief biography:
 
   Malcolm Low is a participant in the 2011 Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation
 New Directions Choreography Lab made possible by generous support from 
the Ford Foundation. Mr. Low is orginally from Chicago where he first 
trained with Joseph Holmes Chicago, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, Homer 
Bryyant and the Ruth Page Foundation. Low went on to perform with Joseph
 Holmes Chicago Dance Co., Les Ballets Jazz
 de Montreal, Ballet British Columbia, Ronald K. Brown/Evidence, Stephen
 Peternio, Complexions, Zvi Gotheneir and Dancers, Margo Sappington and 
most notably the Bill T. Jones/ Arnie Zane Dance Co., where he had the 
great pleasure of touring with Bill T. Jones on his solo show As I Was 
Saying. Recently, he has been working with Crystal Pite and her company 
KIDD PIVOT on the project LOST ACTION. Low has been showing work in NYC 
since 1999: at the River to River Festival in collaboration with DJ 
Spooky (2003), The House That Jack Built at DanceNow (2009), Catch N 
Release Variation #35 at Harlem Stage/Emoves (2009), and Luscious Colors
 of an Unclear Canvas at the Wave Rising Series (2009) Uneven Wall False Security/HOME Wave Rising Series(2010) Pushing Against Sisyphus at Brooklyn Art Exchange(2011).

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>A Dance Can is a New York City based movement company founded in 2011 by Sarah Horne. The purpose of the A Dance Can is to encourage choreographic innovation and exploration while also collaborating with varying organizations and communities to make positive social change.</p>
<h3>What we're doing</h3>
<p>Currently we are producing a show called <em>A Modern Tribute</em>. The choreographers are using their artistic voices to create modern tributes to musical legends. The show is bringing together dancers and choreographers from all over the city. A Dance Can is covering all the administrative costs so that the other seven artists being showcased can focus on their work. These artists willingly applied to the show knowing they would not get compensated - but that doesn't seem right! So, we are trying to raise money for them...</p>
<p>These are the talented companies and artists that will be represented:</p>
<p>Antonio Brown<br/>Grace Courvoisier Dance Company<br/>LorenaEganDance<br/>Leah Fox<br/>LiNK! the movement<br/>ModArts Dance Collective<br/>Jennifer Pommiss</p>
<p>The show is being held at The Center for Performance Research on Friday, November 30 and Saturday, December 1. Both shows start at 7:30pm and there will be a reception each night...</p>
<p>Tickets are only $10 in advance. You can purchase them here: <a href=""http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/296489"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/296489</a></p>
<h3>Your impact</h3>
<p>Many of these choreographers and dancers work, rehearse, and perform for free. They spend numerous hours every week, if not everyday, to create art and share it with you. More often than not, dancers and dance-makers do not get compensated for their hard work. They work full-time or multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet. It would be nice to reverse that for a change and compensate them for their artistic contributions.</p>
<h3>The Breakdown</h3>
<p>As you can see - we've been busy organizing a great show. But we need<br/>your help! Production costs are high and we can't afford to pay the choreographers, let alone the performers, unless we raise more money. Your contribution will support these choreographers and fuel future artistic productions. With a donation of just $20 or more, you will have a huge part in helping us make this goal.</p>
<p>If we reach our goal, we will evenly split the money eight ways and give it to the choreographers so that they can disperse the funds as they see fit. If we don't reach our goal, we will take any funds raised and evenly split that. If we make more than our goal, than we'll be able to offer the choreographers even more and save some for future productions. </p>
<h3>What else?</h3>
<p>In light of our mission to collaborate with organizations to make positive social change, the show will he held at the Center for Performance Research (CPR), a “green” theater in Williamsburg. They are the original L.E.E.D. certified building of its kind in Brooklyn. And, we are also collaborating with Community Markets to support eco-friendly living!</p>

L.A.'s
all-female Vox Dance Theatre and the musical artists, Musicàntica, are finally touring our new
program! The complete Fimmine, Artistic Director Sarah Swenson's signature work, and our

<h3><em><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></em></h3>
<p>Schaubühne Lindenfels in Leipzig is a modern theatre in an old magnificant building that was previously used as a ballroom.  </p>
<p>Nowadays it is furthermore not only a theatre but a place where different art-forms meet. With a selective and varied programme, the Schaubühne has built up its unmistakable identity. The secret is the combination of theatrical art, film, music, literature and various festivals, supplemented by new media and fine arts. Complemented by a coffee shop and restaurant, Schaubühne Lindenfels is one of the places to be in the city of Leipzig.</p>
<p>We are proud that our theatre is owned by a community of more than 1000 people. As one of the first cultural institutions in Germany we are constituted as a nonprofit limited company.</p>

<p>The Schaubühne Lindenfels premise was built in 1876 as a dance hall and was at that time one of the largest and most important establishments in Leipzig. In the historic ballroom one can sense the glamour of bygone times still today.</p>
<p>Due to our great success during the last season we are in need for a new seating for our growing audience. It's especially essential for our own theatre-productions, precisely our upcoming premiere of ""Die Spieler"" (""The Gamblers"", based on Dostojewski's novel). </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><em>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</em></strong></h3>
<p>Especially for our theatre-activities in the beautiful old ballroom we need a grandstand that is licensed (you know... German law!) and is easily removable and modifiable. The relationship between actors and spectators within the theater space is questioned in all of our works in different ways. That's why the grandstand should give us the opportunity to change the situation for the audience for each production and within. </p>
<p>We would like to buy 150 seats that fulfill all these requirements. Therefore we need $12 000. </p>
<p>With your contribution you will become part of upcoming productions and the institution too and therefore get on with our idea of a shared theatre: If you give $70 or more, your name will be engraved in one of the seats. Depending on the amount of your support you will furthermore get an impression from the production in form of a DVD, free entrance to one of our events (valid for one year!) and/or - as long as we are a nonprofit limited company. (Please find more information on the limited company on our profile.) And how does a paid flight to Leipzig sounds like? </p>
<p>Additional funds will be used for our next production, most probably for the stage setting. If we shouldn't reach the entire goal we won't be able to buy as many new chairs as needed for our audience. </p>

In a word, FIERCE. DONATE! This is where we need your help! $5 will pay for a roll of microphone tape, $500 will pay for a graphic designer, $3000 will pay for rehearsal space or $5000 will pay for costumes. OUR GOAL IS TO RAISE: $12,000

A NOTE FROM THE WRITERS  It is a great honor to be asked to be a part of The New York Musical Theatre Festival (NYMF) - and we are really thrilled to be in the company of so many esteemed artists working on shows for the Festival this year!  The Broadway Dolls has become to center of both of our lives for over a year now, and this marks a turning point in both of our careers and for this brand in general.  We have custom built a premiere stage production for NYMF this year, entitled TOUR DE FIERCE! and we are waiting with baited breath to share it with you!  As you might imagine, though it is a great honor to be invited into the New York Musical Theatre Festival, this comes with great expense and a tremendous price tag.  Producing theatre in New York City is wildly expensive and therefore, we are looking for gifts to make our dream come true.  And by gifts, we actually mean money, no matter how large or small the donation, every cent helps us in making our production come to fruition.  

We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your time in reading our donations guide and for patronizing the arts - what we believe to be the greatest entity in the universe, and what makes us tick.  The arts are the beating heart of this amazing and impossible city - the home of Broadway - and by a donation of any size, you are contributing to a dream fulfilled. 
 With Love and Respect, Joey Murray and Hollie Howard

GOALS OF TOUR DE FIERCE Our major goal from participating in The New York Musical Theatre Festival is to book a touring production of Tour De Fierce!  NYMF is providing our company with exposure to the New York theatrical community as a presence in New York is of utmost importance in building the brand of The Broadway Dolls.  Furthermore, a touring production helps to create presence and exposure to the entire nation.  Of course we would love to have a production running here in our home of Manhattan, however we are willing to take the necessary steps to gain exposure before that can happen.  We believe that TOUR DE FIERCE! is a stage production that can be enjoyed by audiences of all ages and walks of life, and that there is tremendous commercial potential in this production.  Though TOUR DE FIERCE! is the edgiest of any Broadway Dolls production to date, it is appropriate for families and could be enjoyed by anyone who loves music and art - and of course Broadway!  It is also cutting edge and captures the flavor of our fast-paced, loud, and ferocious city, something necessary for a production based on New York and Broadway culture.WHY IS TOUR DE FIERCE EASY TO PRODUCE? The Broadway Dolls are a self contained act.  As opposed to traditional musicals that require leading roles that sing and act, with an ensemble of dancers in the background, the Dolls are always front and center.  Five actresses that do it all.  Though down the line we would like to integrate more spectacle and visual theatricality, we pride ourselves on being an act that keeps talent and great material as the true star of our show.

trio of sea plays; an inspired marriage of setting and scene.  
About Us
We are a group of
talented and creative theatre lovers who desperately want this production to go

Assistant Director to Jack O'Brien and Mark Lamos and was influential in the
campaign to build a new theatre for Provincetown that successfully opened in
2003.  Last year Kenneth directed the UK premiere of Horton Foot's The
Trip to Bountiful at London's Courtyard Theatre.

production team are the designer Van Santvoord, the lighting
designer Emma Chapman, the sound and music designer Alex Baranowski and the costume
designer Spyros Koscinas.

<div>    I, as an individual artist, am against violence. I do think it's time we human beings evolve into a better state where we all accept each other as we choose to be and stop judging or trying to force others to think as we think. Freedom of speech, expression should be a right not a privilege. Art is a common language for all human beings. It is also a messenger of truth, honesty, reality, purity and most importantly HOPE.. and my HOPE is to build many bridges of con-nection through this powerful form in our  Fall / Spring 2013 - 2014 Season. <br/><br/>    We have some very exciting projects coming up and I am very happy to share them with you.. All our dancers both in NY and in Istanbul are very excited to be a part of the upcoming process, travels and teachings / sharing the experience with the youngsters who maybe has never been exposed to art in such a way..</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Bridge 1: Multicultural Festival</strong></div>
<div>    After a busy, productive and recently roughened couple months back in my homeland Istanbul, I am back in New York, for a period of time, to mend my heart through making some new work and sharing some work from the previous process in Istanbul. I will be choreographing two new works for two young energetic NY based companies, <strong>Mari Meade Dance Collective</strong> and <strong>Project 44</strong>.. The two quartets I will be setting on 4 female and 4 male dancers will premiere by the end of July, in the <strong>Between the Seas Festival </strong>produced by<strong> Aktina Stathaki</strong>.. An amazing festival which brings many artists from the Mediterranean countries and have them share their works with the NY audience.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Birdge 2: ""Come, come whoever you are"" - Rumi</strong></div>
<div>    I have premiered a new work called ""HEVA"" in Istanbul through the end of May, before things started getting rough. In Heva, I only had an image, a sitting man in the middle of the stage as a starting image -one as a whole, the whole in one-, searching for something, seeking something.. Then another man joins in with him and the connection begins, the story starts and the relationship builds up from there. That sitting man ""Rumi"" and his most beloved friend ""Shams of Thabriz"".. For another amazing showcase held at Peridance of NY in mid August, I will be bringing Evrim Akyay, who was recently performing with the Jerusalem Dance Theater of Israel and who came back to Istanbul for a couple months and joined our process, took part in Heva, my latest creation. It has been quite a long time since we last danced, took breathe and be present together on the stage, but when we re-united after all these years, the result was stunning.. Our duet received many compliments from the audience and before bringing Heva to New York in the Spring - Summer of 2014, I am so humbled and excited to share this duet with the New York dance scene..</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Bridge 3: Cultural Exposure</strong></div>
<div>   I also am so proud and excited to let you all know that I am holding an audition in August at Peridance, NY -<a href=""http://peridance.com/-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://peridance.com/-</a> to take some of the dancers with me to Turkey so we can expand the piece, make it even more inter cultural and multinational as I believe through art it is possible to share hope, change the world and humanity for the better.. And ""dance"" is such a human form of art that every individual finds a way to connect with it..</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Bridge 4: Professional Dancers &amp; Children</strong></div>
<div>    Throughout the whole season of Fall 2013 - Spring 2014, with the American and Turkish dancers together, we plan on holding several workshops for the kids in Turkey wherever we tour the piece.. These kids, who might not have had the opportunity to experience art, will not only witness the work of art but will participate in the process of being an artist.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>    With this campaign my goal to raise at least<strong> $23,000..</strong> Which will include the flights of the American and Turkish dancers (6 on the total) from NY to Istanbul, and cover at least 50 hours of rehearsal space, costume fees, accommodation of the dancers and some extra expenses for administrative stuff.. Though I am still seeking some sponsorship for the flights and such, so I decided to keep my limit at <strong>$7,777</strong> and see how things build up.. But anything beyond that will be used wisely and creatively..</div>
<div> </div>
<div>    Giving $1 is not little.. Your support is needed for these projects to be heard, recognized, to be known and be supported by others.. If you can, please do support and share with others, if you don't have the economy to do so, please help spread the word.. Help me build this bridge of hope and art as this is a very important time in my country's history</div>

Which will include the flights of the American and Turkish dancers (6 on the total) from NY to Istanbul, and cover at least 50 hours of rehearsal space, costume fees, accommodation of the dancers and some extra expenses for administrative stuff.. Though I am still seeking some sponsorship for the flights and such, so I decided to keep my limit at $7,777 and see how things build up.. But anything beyond that will be used wisely and creatively..
 
    Giving $1 is not little.. Your support is needed for these projects to be heard, recognized, to be known and be supported by others.. If you can, please do support and share with others, if you don't have the economy to do so, please help spread the word.. Help me build this bridge of hope and art as this is a very important time in my country's history
 
    What your contributions will cover:
    (July)

     - The studio rental fee for the new productions in collaboration with Mari Meade Dance Collective and Project 44 which we are going to premiere within the Between the Seas Festival..
     - Some other administrative fees that needs being spent..     - Costume for the new pieces..
    (August)

     - Airfare for bringing a Turkish dancer from Istanbul to perform with me..
     - Accommodation for the dancer and other expenses..
     - We also will be holding a private performance in late August for our supporters based in NY followed by a cocktail..
     - Rehearsal period studio rental fee for the showcase in mid-August..
 
    (September)

     - Airfare for bringing 4 American dancers to Istanbul to participate in the performances in Istanbul with the Turkish dancers..
     - Accommodation (partially) expenses of the dancers..
     - Workshops organized in Anatolia, when the company tours in Turkey.. (throughout the year)

3) Provide New York actors and non-actors alike with workshops in which to
promote dialogue and communication between seasoned professionals and novices
in the acting profession.

How You Can Help:


We need to fund our Teaching Artists and The Shakespeare Forum Outreach Division.

We need money for production costs and actor stipends.
We need money to pay for our donation-based Tuesday night workshop space.



                                                                        ANDWe desperately need a permanent space for The Shakespeare Forum to reside in. A space in which to work, rehearse, teach and welcome our ever-growing member base. If you are unable to support us financially, perhaps you can help us in this quest for a place to call home.



$10 (The Puck) provides 1/2 hour of rehearsal space.$25 (The Rosalind) provides text materials for one school group.$50 (The Don Armado) provides space for one workshop.$100 (The Cleopatra) provides the salary for one teaching artist in a school visit.$250 (The Claudius) provides a stipend for one actor.$500 (The Orlando) provides one school with a visit from The Shakespeare Forum.$1000 (The Benedick) provides for a production set.$2500 (The Player King) provides for one week of performance space.$5000 (The Henry V) provides performance space for a 2-week production.

<h2><strong><em>Whammy!</em> goes to NYC</strong></h2>
<p>HotCity Theatre of St. Louis, and creator/director Chuck Harper, are damn happy to tell you that we are taking our orginal dance/theatre production of <em>""Whammy! The Seven Secrets to a Sane Self""</em> to the New York International Fringe Theatre Festival.  Chosen from over 800 applicants, ""<em>Whammy!""</em> will be performed at the CSV Flamboyan Theatre on Manhattan's Lower East Side from August 15-24.</p>
<p>We are an ensemble of St. Louis-based theatre artists who are eager to show this unique and provocative production (premiered at HotCity in 2011) in our nation's theatre capital.  Your donation will provide transportation and housing for the cast and crew of eight during the fourteen days that they will be on the road and performing.  Performing in New York will be a dream come true for the <em>Whammy!</em> gang and we can't thank you enough for helping us to achieve this dream.</p>
<div>
<h2>What We Need (and what you get!)</h2>
<p>Although HotCity will be providing invaluable production and financial assistance (including rehearsal space, benefit performance venue, and marketing/staffing support) this project falls outside of our annual operating budgets and we need help to make it happen. We are raising a total of $9,000 for this event and our goal is raise $6,000 through Indiegogo (ie. you!).  The remainder of the budget will come from benefit performances and state grants.  Our needs are simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,500 for transportation (vehicle rental, fuel, etc.)</li>
<li>$4,000 for lodging (ten nights for eight people in NYC)</li>
<li>$2,500 for miscellaneous production costs (insurance, NYC personel, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>HotCity Theatre will be providing the support we need to remount and produce the show including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal Space for the remount</li>
<li>Venue and staffing for benefit performances in St. Louis</li>
<li>Staffing and support for Columbus, Ohio benefit performance</li>
<li>Marketing and Publicity for the remount</li>
<li>Festival registration fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Your donations will go directly to the travel and lodging needs of the cast and crew.  And should we surpass our goal?  We can start per diem stipends for the cast and crew!</p>
<p>We have a list of unique and Whammy!-appropriate perks on the page that we hope will give you that little extra nudge to do a donation-click.  They are all an expression of a very, very thankful group of theatre artists.  This is your chance at a limited-edition  <em>Whammy!</em> doodle by our scenic artist Mikey Butane Thomas.  Or a dvd of the NYC production along with special features of the cast and crew around the city and backstage.  Whatever you can donate will be greatly appreciated by team <em>Whammy!</em></p>
<h2>The Impact (ours and yours!)</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>As you already know if you have watched the video above (and for heaven's sake, please watch it if you haven't!) we feel that this is an entertaining and important piece of theatre that we are thrilled to be sharing with a wider audience.  We would like to think that, in our own quirky way, we are contributing to a saner society.  And your donation means that you are doing the same.</p>
<p>The artists involved in this project have a proven record of succesful national and international projects of this nature.  Chuck Harper (creator/director) has had his work produced in the US from Los Angeles to Chicago (but not yet NYC!) and in Europe in France, Germany and the Czech Republic.  He has received local, state and national grants including the NEA's ArtsLink International Partners grant.  Mikey Butane Thomas has seen his dances and movement activities performed around the US and in Taipei and Toronto as well.   This project will be a milestone for all the artists on team <em>Whammy!</em> as we bring our newest, and craziest, project to the biggest stage of all. </p>

<div>
<h2>You Love Us But Times are Tight?</h2>
<p>If you are unable to donate at this time, we still love you, and we still need your help.  Here's what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your friends and family to check us out and make a donation.  (Really, you can kind of claim credit for these funds) </li>
<li>If you live in St. Louis or Columbus, tell your friends and family to check out our website and to make a reservation for the benefit performance parties</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p class=""font_7""><span><span>Life is like rain</span></span>.  We all experience it.  Sometimes it can be violent and tragic, leaving scars that never heal... or as peaceful as the morning dew. </p>
<p class=""font_7"">The story of ""<em>RAIN</em>,"" uses the symbolism to parallel the lives of Matthew Carpenter and Renee Marshall - two people with tragic pasts, both on different pathways of destruction.  Until they meet on the road to redemption, and everything changes.</p>
<p class=""font_7"">RAIN is unlike anything you have ever experienced in a theatrical production!  The story will captivate you with gut-wrenching sorrow, and relieve you with moments of great joy, followed by a powerful dose of inspiration!</p>
<p class=""font_7""> </p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Our intention is to tour with this production, reaching as many people in as many cities as possible throughout 2014/2015, so honestly, the more money we raise, the more we will be able to accomplish this goal.</p>
<p>We are pros at stretching our dollars and relying upon in-kind material donations and volunteers, but that only goes so far without financial support.  </p>
<p>Initially, we need $25,000 to help pay for theatre rental, rehearsal space, set build out, marketing and promotion needs, small stipend for actors and crew, and some travel costs.</p>
<p>In return for your support, we are offering some incredible (and I do mean INCREDIBLE) perks that you can display proudly and remember ""RAIN - the Experience"" and how your generous financial seed impacted communities around the country.</p>
<p>Check out the perks for more detail.</p>
<p>Should we not meet our initial $25,000 goal, whatever amount we do raise will be a tremendous help in getting us started.  We do have some private investors who are waiting to see how much money we DO raise on our own, and they will contribute once we have the pre-production well underway.  </p>
<p>So, not only are you supporting a very unique and worthy production, making a difference in people's lives, and creating an experience for audiences around the country, you are building support by others who have interest in RAIN!  </p>
<p>Your gift, no matter the size, is the gift that keeps on giving! </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p class=""font_7"">Dealing with adult themes such as HIV/AIDS, domestic violence, and death, RAIN takes the audience on a faith-filled voyage of emotions and gives voice to people imprisoned by hidden secrets.  </p>
<p class=""font_7"">In the end, the audience will be mesmerized and moved by the impeccable drama and inspirational story of redemption.</p>
<p class=""font_7"">Supporting this campaign will provide a powerful community outreach that extends beyond a play.  This production is designed to be a tool to help hurting people impacted by tragedy and trauma, abuse, terminal illness, depression, suicide, financial distress, and other emotional or physical issues.</p>
<p class=""font_7"">Resources will be made available at the end of the play to help those in need or at-risk, and your financial support will make this all possible!</p>
<p class=""font_7"">Written and produced by Leo Pacheco, who is an author, founder of 3 faith-based non-profit organizations, a successful business consultant, and recognized by several awards and accolades for his community outreach efforts, Leo's passion for hurting people is what inspired him to create RAIN.</p>
<p class=""font_7"">""Aside from my personal storms in life, I have had the difficult challenge of serving as a grief counselor to people who are really struggling with life,"" Leo says, ""And RAIN gives voice to those who don't know how to put their pain into words.""</p>
<p class=""font_7"">But, RAIN isn't all about pain and suffering.  It has an inspirational story to tell!</p>
<p class=""font_7"">Leo says, ""We don't want to take the audience to a dark place and leave them there.  We want to offer hope that there is light at the end of the darkness, and they can be set free from the storms they face.  That's what RAIN is all about - hope and redemption.""</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you cannot support financially, you may know others who can.  But, there are other ways you can help make an impact with RAIN.  Here are just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>PRAY</strong> - Pray for peace, deliverance from the pain, and for life-changing impacts to be felt everywhere we go.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>PROMOTION</strong> - Word of mouth is the cheapest, yet most valuable, form of marketing.  We don't have to pay for it, yet it is priceless!  After all, promoting something you believe in will excite and engage others to do the same, so helping promote RAIN is far more valuable than often money can buy.  Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools and spread the word via social media.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>VOLUNTEER</strong> - Giving of your time and expertise is worth a ton!  Volunteers help keep the overhead down and provide us more bang for our supporters' bucks!  So, if you have a talent or expertise, don't be afraid to inquire about helping us out!  You never know how beneficial this can be.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>FUNDRAISE</strong> - You may not have a large bank account, but you may know someone who does.  Or simply gathering a few friends who each contribute what they can, adds up greatly!  Or have a party where you invite us to come over and give potential donors a preview of RAIN so your friends know what they are contributing to.  After all, who wouldn't want a semi-pro actor as a special guest?  He or she may be the next Meryl Streep or Hugh Jackman!  And you had them at your party first!</li>

WHY GLITTER BEACH?

When Vicky Hamilton (legendary rock manager, A&R person and writer) www.vickyhamilton.com:and Robbie Quine (quintessential glam rock cult hero, surfer, musician and writer)www.myspace.com/theofficalbarbarellatones got together in 2007 to write Glitter Beach they talked about their favorite plays and what they themselves would pay to see. They embarked on an undertaking of writing a musical that took Rocky Horror with a side of Hedwig and The Angry Inch added some sexy Glam Rock music ala David Bowie and took it to the beach. When they finished, they knew they had something fun, imaginative and special.

In 2010 Hamilton stalked Hollywood ""It"" boy director Daniel Henning www.theblank.com and begged him to take a look at the first draft. Henning agreed it could be special if it was rewritten and set in 1967. So under Henning, Hamilton and Quine rewrote the musical and had their first reading at The Blank Theatre in March 2011. It was a sold out success! 

NOW WE NEED YOUR HELP TO TAKE GLITTER BEACH TO THE NEXT LEVEL so Glitter Beach can see the light of day and hit stages around the globe,  bringing misfits, bullies, mermaids, glam rockers, and surfers together everywhere for a magical night of fun! Other goals include helping the Surfrider Foundation, save our oceans and beaches.  
GLITTER BEACH AND THE SURF RIDER FOUNDATION TEAM UP TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.
5% of all donations to Glitter Beach will be given to the Surf Rider Foundation to save or oceans and beaches.

Die Opernakademie Bad Orb, eine in der Bundesrepublik wohl einmalige kulturelle Bürgerinitiative, fördert seit vielen Jahren sehr erfolgreich den internationalen Sängernachwuchs für die Opernbühne. Kontinuierlich, ehrlich und zielorientiert gibt die Opernakademie jungen Sängerinnen und Sängern die hervorragende Chance, sich unter professioneller Anleitung durch die Einstudierung und Aufführung einer kompletten Oper auf den schwierigen Bühnenberuf vorzubereiten. Jährlich werden aus hunderten von Bewerberinnen und Bewerbern die Solistinnen und Solisten für die einzelnen Produktionen ausgewählt.Seit 1987 haben junge Vokalistinnen und Vokalisten aus zahlreichen Ländern rund um den Globus dieses Angebot genutzt.

<h3>Thank you, your help is appreciated</h3>
<p>       When I was a little girl, I was incredibly shy.  I use to hide behind my mother’s legs whenever strangers and even family members were around.  Despite being so timid, I had dreams of being a singer and an actress.  At the age of 12, my best friend at the time convinced me to join a theatre class at our middle school the following school year.  After my first day in the class, I realized that I had found my calling, but the only thing holding me back was stage fright.  While I waited in the wings before I was to step out onto the stage for the first time, I felt butterflies in my stomach.  It was not out of nervousness one might assume, but excitement.  The curtain rose, the lights came up, and it was then that I realized this was where I wanted to be for the rest of my life.  I broke out of my shell that night, October 22, 2004. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Here are some examples of my singing in  Musical Theatre:</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>       Theatre is my escape from reality and my therapy.  I was raised by a single mom who worked hard to provide for my brother and me.  As soon as I was able to get a job, I did so I could help pay bills.  When I was 19, I moved to Orlando to attend the University of Central Florida to major in Theatre Studies.  I work as much as I can to pay for bills and food, and my mom helps me the best she can from Miami.  I go to school full-time, work part-time, and perform in shows if my availability allows.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some of the shows I've performed in include Man of La Mancha, High School Musical, Rent, Godspell, Seussical, Beauty &amp; the Beast and Jekyll &amp; Hyde</p>
<p><br/><a href=""http://jacnicle.tumblr.com/resume"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here is my resume </a></p>
<p>        Back in October 2012, the Producing Artistic Director, Bruce Earnest, came to UCF to host a Belting Workshop in the Theatre Building.  He told us about International Performing Arts Institute (IPAI) and the Musical Theatre program.  Those interested in the program could use participation  in the workshop as our audition into the program.   Only 20 students in the U.S. are accepted from the thousands that apply &amp; audition.  I received an email about a week later from Bruce offering me a spot in the Musical Theatre program.  It is a 3 week intensive program in Germany this summer (July 7-28).  I will be up there for my birthday.</p>
<p>       Many students that attend the program get picked up to do professional shows in Europe with StageEntertainment.  Mr Earnest told me that I am very marketable in Europe with my looks and talent.  This is a very big opportunity for me because Europe likes fresh faces.  I have been given an opportunity of a lifetime, but the only thing that is hindering me is money.  With your help, I can take the first step in making my dreams come true.  Whatever you can give will help tremendously and even if you can’t, tell people who you know can.  Thank you for taking the time to view my campaign.</p>
<p> Tuition is $5225 plus whatever transportation to the program (airfare, transportation from airport to location).  </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
International Performing Arts Institute (IPAI) offers professional training in both musical theatre and opera from artists from all over the world. The primary goal of IPAI is to help people realize their full potential as a singer-actor in an environment that nurtures their creativity while offering real-life opportunities for artistic employment in Europe.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The IPAI Musical Theatre Program includes Musical Theatre Intensives in Hamburg, Germany where participants work with casting directors from Stage Entertainment, the largest producer of musicals in Europe.  The European Musical Theate Audition Program is also located in Hamburg, Germany and is hosted by the Joop Van den Ende Academy in coordination with Stage Entertainment.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Housing and transportation for the Musical Theatre Intensive in Hamburg are included.  Students experience the opportunity to work with choreographers, casting agents and voice teachers along with students who are currently performing in shows such as Wicked, Lion King, Mama Mia, Elton John's Aida and Dirty Dancing.  IPAI participants will have the opportunity to attend a show, and if applicable, audition for Stage Entertainment.</div>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>This is what I need to get me there and how I can thank you</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tuition fees for the course is $5225 plus whatever transportation to the program (airfare, transportation from airport to location).</li>
<li>For a contribution to my future my wonderful donors will be thanked with various perks ranging from social thanks , A video thank you, a personal postcard sent to you from Germany, me singing you a song of your choice, my promoton of your project or company, a photomosaic with your image or avatar and finally for those who can get themselves to Germnay at the time, a tour with me of the Interntonal Performing Arts Institute</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How much your help will impact my life</h3>
<p>This course acceptance is huge to me. Not only am I so lucky to have been picked, but this could well open the door to working for Stage Entertainment and the global production opportunities that could therefore follow.</p>

       When I was a little girl, I was incredibly shy.  I use to hide behind my mother’s legs whenever strangers and even family members were around.  Despite being so timid, I had dreams of being a singer and an actress.  At the age of 12, my best friend at the time convinced me to join a theatre class at our middle school the following school year.  After my first day in the class, I realized that I had found my calling, but the only thing holding me back was stage fright.  While I waited in the wings before I was to step out onto the stage for the first time, I felt butterflies in my stomach.  It was not out of nervousness one might assume, but excitement.  The curtain rose, the lights came up, and it was then that I realized this was where I wanted to be for the rest of my life.  I broke out of my shell that night, October 22, 2004. 
 
Here are some examples of my singing in  Musical Theatre:
Jac Sickels (Emma) & I (Lucy) singing 'In His Eyes- Jekell & Hyde' in our Musical Theatre Voice final.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK7fZpVZIrE …
 
""Deep Love"" from Young Frankenstein   My Musical #Theatre Voice 1 final at UCF 2013  http://youtu.be/lElFhIHHIjY
 
My Cover of ""Don't Forget Me"" from ''Smash"" - http://youtu.be/sppfGr8QVp4 
 
       Theatre is my escape from reality and my therapy.  I was raised by a single mom who worked hard to provide for my brother and me.  As soon as I was able to get a job, I did so I could help pay bills.  When I was 19, I moved to Orlando to attend the University of Central Florida to major in Theatre Studies.  I work as much as I can to pay for bills and food, and my mom helps me the best she can from Miami.  I go to school full-time, work part-time, and perform in shows if my availability allows.  
 
Some of the shows I've performed in include Man of La Mancha, High School Musical, Rent, Godspell, Seussical, Beauty & the Beast and Jekyll & Hyde
Here is my resume 
        Back in October 2012, the Producing Artistic Director, Bruce Earnest, came to UCF to host a Belting Workshop in the Theatre Building.  He told us about International Performing Arts Institute (IPAI) and the Musical Theatre program.  Those interested in the program could use participation  in the workshop as our audition into the program.   Only 20 students in the U.S. are accepted from the thousands that apply & audition.  I received an email about a week later from Bruce offering me a spot in the Musical Theatre program.  It is a 3 week intensive program in Germany this summer (July 7-28).  I will be up there for my birthday.
       Many students that attend the program get picked up to do professional shows in Europe with StageEntertainment.  Mr Earnest told me that I am very marketable in Europe with my looks and talent.  This is a very big opportunity for me because Europe likes fresh faces.  I have been given an opportunity of a lifetime, but the only thing that is hindering me is money.  With your help, I can take the first step in making my dreams come true.  Whatever you can give will help tremendously and even if you can’t, tell people who you know can.  Thank you for taking the time to view my campaign.
 Tuition is $5225 plus whatever transportation to the program (airfare, transportation from airport to location).  
 
For more information, check out the website at:
http://internationalperformingartsinstitute.com/
 
International Performing Arts Institute (IPAI) offers professional training in both musical theatre and opera from artists from all over the world. The primary goal of IPAI is to help people realize their full potential as a singer-actor in an environment that nurtures their creativity while offering real-life opportunities for artistic employment in Europe.
 
The IPAI Musical Theatre Program includes Musical Theatre Intensives in Hamburg, Germany where participants work with casting directors from Stage Entertainment, the largest producer of musicals in Europe.  The European Musical Theate Audition Program is also located in Hamburg, Germany and is hosted by the Joop Van den Ende Academy in coordination with Stage Entertainment.
 
Housing and transportation for the Musical Theatre Intensive in Hamburg are included.  Students experience the opportunity to work with choreographers, casting agents and voice teachers along with students who are currently performing in shows such as Wicked, Lion King, Mama Mia, Elton John's Aida and Dirty Dancing.  IPAI participants will have the opportunity to attend a show, and if applicable, audition for Stage Entertainment.
 

This is what I need to get me there and how I can thank you

Tuition fees for the course is $5225 plus whatever transportation to the program (airfare, transportation from airport to location).
For a contribution to my future my wonderful donors will be thanked with various perks ranging from social thanks , A video thank you, a personal postcard sent to you from Germany, me singing you a song of your choice, my promoton of your project or company, a photomosaic with your image or avatar and finally for those who can get themselves to Germnay at the time, a tour with me of the Interntonal Performing Arts Institute

 


How much your help will impact my life
This course acceptance is huge to me. Not only am I so lucky to have been picked, but this could well open the door to working for Stage Entertainment and the global production opportunities that could therefore follow.

<p><b>Hi All!</b></p>
<p><b>Aleya here (in Cairo) I am so
excited to present a brand new, amazing project to you. I can’t wait till it’s all up and
running and you can finally take belly dance classes and folkloric classes
online with teachers from Cairo!  </b><b>I’m
trying to launch by Feb. 2014.  Just in
time for my birthday and Valentines Day and it will be a great gift to myself
for you all to be able to take classes online with all of the best teachers in
Cairo.  I know it’s difficult to come to
Cairo with the expense and political upheaval, but now, from the privacy of your
own home you can come to Cairo and study with your favorite teachers! This is a
big, ground breaking project and it has taken some time to get everything
right, but I still need your help to launch and I hope you all can contribute
to this fantastic project.  I have wanted to do this project for well over 10 years but when I conceived of the idea the technology was not even available and now that it has caught up with my dream I started,  and now there is no going back! :) </b></p>
<p><b>I have been living in Egypt for
the past 5 years performing, teaching, travelling the world teaching,  learning from many master teachers, and selling beautiful costumes.  I lived through a revolution, which has still not ended and have experienced wonderful and incredible things that belly dance has brought to my life.  Also, during this time I have had the honor to take class with
all of the amazing teachers at the festivals and privately.   It has been an invaluable learning experience for me and I would love to
be able to share that with you and the
world.   </b></p>
<p><b>What is Cairobellydance.com? </b></p>
<p>This is going to be a website
where you can actually take classes from teachers in Cairo online.  Many will be full choreographies and some
will be technique, or teaching you how to improvise or even just the basics.  Most of the teachers have been dancing for
20-30+ years and I will also have foreigners who have lived and worked in Cairo
absorbing the culture and the nuances of the dance.  Eventually, I would love this to be your GO
TO resource for all things related to belly dance and folklore dance in the
Middle East.  Costumes, music, what’s
happening in Cairo, blogs.  I would like
this to be one big portal to the Middle East where you can just push on one
button and all of it will be at your fingertips! </p>
<p><b>Why is this important?</b></p>
<p>From costumes, to music, to
choreographies and history I am certain this will be an invaluable tool for your
training and ongoing study of belly dance and folkloric dance from the Middle
East. We learn dance from so many teachers, but I believe you never can fully
grasp the concept of Oriental dance unless you have access to study with master
teachers from Egypt who are Egyptian and have the feeling for the dance.  Most importantly you will be able to watch
them move and articulate the movements, and in this way you will gain some
understanding of the quality that is associated with belly dance, that elusive
“feeling” of belly dance that is so hard to grasp unless you have traveled
extensively to the Middle East to study with master teachers.  </p>
<p><b>What I need and why I need it!</b></p>
<p>I need about $22,000 dollars to
cover the cost of the FIRST ROUND of teachers. 
I have already recorded many videos out of the kindness of the teachers,
but of course I don’t have money to pay everyone.  This was done out of the kindness of their
hearts to share their dance with the world, and their vision for how Egyptian
belly dance should be presented.  The $22,000
will cover payments to the teachers as a thank you for taking the time to come
to the studio and film which is usually very grueling and time consuming.  I also need to buy some more equipment to
give you the highest quality video that can be produced.  In addition, I will be
producing an album with the world famous Safaa Farid Negoom Orchestra to be
used  for the filming and to be sold
online, so we can have high quality music, free of constraints related to music
rights. This will cover the cost of an editor as well,  to edit the videos which usually take about one
week to edit per class,  and the editor is doing a great job of completing all the
videos we have filmed thus far.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Break it Down</b></p>
<p>Payments for teachers $12,000</p>
<p>Album $4,000</p>
<p>Editor $1,500</p>
<p>Equipment $2,500</p>
<p>Other expendables ie, website
$2000</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>I believe that belly dance is
an amazing, magical, healing art.  I have
taught cancer patients who said they beat cancer and belly dance was a big part
of the reason why.  Dance heals so many
people, it helps people to become healthy, it brings joy to the dancer and
their audience, belly dance helps women accept their bodies and gives them
greater confidence and joy in their lives. 
If you want to be happy just dance! </p>
<p>I believe that the world needs
this and belly dance needs this to survive well into the future, and to have
the teachers live on in outer space always ready, willing, and able to teach
you what you need to learn.  I wish that
Sohair Zaki and Tahia Karioka and many other dance legends had filmed classes,
and we were able to take classes online with them.  Now, all Egyptian teachers can live on indefinitely teaching by internet for as long as it stays in the ethers of the
universe.  Technology is amazing and I am
so grateful that we have this tool.  I hope all of these classes will be available for the next 100 years!  This is going to be a great resource to preserve the dance and I'm so excited about it. </p>
<p>I hope that you can see what I
envision for this project and the future of it. 
I am certain that all learning will soon be online and this is an
amazing opportunity to help grow this wonderful resource for our beloved
dance.  </p>

Rather than play it safe we've gone for something ambitious and a little dangerous. We have come together from various backgrounds in film, TV and theatre to create an original story.</p>
<p>""The Shadow Formula"" is a noir thriller set in London, 1938, with a cast of 18 characters, 20 scenes, choreographed fights and daring escapes that are so action-packed, even the audience might not be safe!</p>
<h3>The Plot</h3>
<p>Washed-up veteran of The Great War, Cary Donat is content to ignore the gathering storm in Europe and drink himself into oblivion. However, when his fiancée Lily is callously murdered, he finds himself plunged into a deadly game of double-cross and espionage.</p>
<p>Hunted by the police and his enemies alike, Cary must clear his name, get his revenge, solve the mystery and save the world. His only allies are Raz, a beautiful rogue agent, and Claude, his old comrade from the trenches.</p>
<p>Together they must out-smart, out-fight and out-manoeuvre a ruthless gang of thugs, fascists and foreign spies, and destroy the monstrous Shadow Formula ... before it destroys the world.</p>
<p>""The Shadow Formula"" is entertaining, fast-paced and intelligent, but also stylish, unconventional and surprising.</p>
<h3>But why, you ask? </h3>
<p>We really believe that ""The Shadow Formula"" is fresh and fun with a good dose of mystery and excitement thrown in. It takes itself seriously when dealing with convoluted plots about spies and mad scientists and is being produced for the sake of a good yarn and nothing more: we aim to thrill and amuse the audience in equal measure.</p>
<p>Our ambition comes at a price. The show is being produced with a lot of hard work, commitment and, indeed, love: but they can only go so far. We need your help to make it the best it can be. Your donations will help to pay our essential costs and keep our ticket prices affordable, making sure it's a show that's accessible to the widest possible audience.</p>
<p>Without ""The Shadow Formula"" the world will be a greyer place (but, sadly, not like a stylish black and white film!)</p>
<h3>Where does the money go?</h3>
<p>Every penny of the cash raised here will go towards production costs such as set construction, transport, props, costumes and everything else we need to make the show 100% awesome. We're trying to be clever about how we do things and being on a tight budget certainly encourages creativity: but there are some things, especially some of the vintage stuff, that we just have to get right. Your investment can help us to bring this production to its full potential.</p>
<h3>Finally</h3>
<p>We're not just excited about getting your money: we're excited that people want to be a part of this. We’re even more excited that people want to come and see it so, whatever you do, tell a friend, spread the word and come see the show.</p>
<p>We hope you'll be as excited about ""The Shadow Formula"" as we are!</p></div>","We are Theatrica Ludos and this is our first London Fringe production (at The Greenwood Theatre, London Bridge).

Hunted by the police and his enemies alike, Cary must clear his name, get his revenge, solve the mystery and save the world. His only allies are Raz, a beautiful rogue agent, and Claude, his old comrade from the trenches.
Together they must out-smart, out-fight and out-manoeuvre a ruthless gang of thugs, fascists and foreign spies, and destroy the monstrous Shadow Formula ... before it destroys the world.
""The Shadow Formula"" is entertaining, fast-paced and intelligent, but also stylish, unconventional and surprising.
But why, you ask? 
We really believe that ""The Shadow Formula"" is fresh and fun with a good dose of mystery and excitement thrown in. It takes itself seriously when dealing with convoluted plots about spies and mad scientists and is being produced for the sake of a good yarn and nothing more: we aim to thrill and amuse the audience in equal measure.
Our ambition comes at a price. The show is being produced with a lot of hard work, commitment and, indeed, love: but they can only go so far. We need your help to make it the best it can be. Your donations will help to pay our essential costs and keep our ticket prices affordable, making sure it's a show that's accessible to the widest possible audience.
Without ""The Shadow Formula"" the world will be a greyer place (but, sadly, not like a stylish black and white film!)
Where does the money go?
Every penny of the cash raised here will go towards production costs such as set construction, transport, props, costumes and everything else we need to make the show 100% awesome. We're trying to be clever about how we do things and being on a tight budget certainly encourages creativity: but there are some things, especially some of the vintage stuff, that we just have to get right. Your investment can help us to bring this production to its full potential.
Finally
We're not just excited about getting your money: we're excited that people want to be a part of this. We’re even more excited that people want to come and see it so, whatever you do, tell a friend, spread the word and come see the show.
We hope you'll be as excited about ""The Shadow Formula"" as we are!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Renaissance Festivals all over North America continue to provide multiple stages for unique historically and myth based influenced performances, vendor/shop opportunities for history and myth inspired products and performance developing improv and scripted challenges for their own storyline and villagers casts. <br/><br/>A select few of the many who are presently with us. </p>
<p>*Martin - Villager/property manager: Props and sets have been his profession since 1990 and this is an extension of that.<br/>*Chrisitina - Captain Charity/Co Fight Coordinator etc.: Performing for roughly 35 years, she puts her experiences in front of and behind the scenes to full use with all that she accomplishes on this.<br/>*Ed - Cobbs Merrin and Co Fight Coordinator: Actor, graphic deisgner, artist. Having consistent long time fighters provide a more impressive performance. Also creates our Christmas cards.<br/>*Joshua - Young John and youngest member of cast: This 11 year old actor is smart, curious and talented. For a character that was originally written for one year he insists on coming back.<br/>*Julia - Queen Catherine: This talented piano teacher, dedicated actor is developing interest in production management.<br/>*Amethyst - Costumer and villager: Straight out of fashion design this project provides her with more creative expression and an opportunity to not be limited to the restricting body types of fashion.<br/>*Chilam - Sheriff: Artist and actor. Since his first day on this project he has found artistic expression through the character and the creation of our backdrops.</p>
<p>It takes roughly 50 to 150 volunteers, cast, command team, performers... etc... to make this event happen.  All of them with their own needs, ideals and goals that this project helps nourish.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>The finances to fund this project have come primarily from three different sources. The Co-Producers, ticket sales and vendor fees. Donations of materials and serivces have helped keep costs down and with a volunteer cast and crew, we have managed to continue the performance with less financial stress. However... Selling a new concept in BC has been a developing process that requires more than these sources can provide. We are barely surviving with a fraction of what we truly need in order to provide this product. Our ticket prices and vendor fees are smaller then they need to be in order to support growth, let alone maintain what we have. This project has become a second family and an entertainment opportunity that many have fallen in love with and now make it a wonderful part of their lives. Our goal is to pay off some of the back debt the producers have incured (mostly from interest on loans and start up costs) by raising enough money to help pay for 2013, leaving them some breather space to deal with back debt. Their belief in this project has had them contributing many times in order to keep prices more than reasonable for the performance the audience receives.</p>

<h3>Where The Money Will Go</h3>
<p>We will admit that our goal is smaller than our needs. We have chosen to focus on the BIG thing we know we cannot do without.</p>
<p>Property: We are presently looking for a new location in Langley (we will update if that is found before this campaign is done.). Based on past experiences property rental tends to cost us $2,000,00 to $4,000.00 for the one weekend. Some of the locations have charged us for set up and teardown days as well as additional fees, where as others just the weekend property use.</p>
<p>Just to give you an idea of our approx expenses (based roughly on department reports and receipts), PER year, and let you know where additional money will go if we make over the goal amount):</p>
<p>Entertainment related expenses including Jousters, stage needs, games and rides, etc. $15,000.00</p>
<p>Cast specific expenses including costumes, insurance, greenroom costs, props, first aid, etc. $10,000.00</p>
<p>Property needs (based on new needs on a new site) including seating, power, drinkable water, etc $3,000.00</p>
<p>If we can get the liquor laws changed back (Link for that petition is: <a href=""http://chn.ge/TnA5QK"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://chn.ge/TnA5QK</a> ) the ‘pub’ costs us approx $3,000.00 to have.</p>
<p>Additional costs like security needs, ticket sales needs, advertising (flyers, webpage, etc), program books, webpage, etc. usually can cost us around: $10,000.00 <br/><br/>This is all depending on how much we can reuse from year to year and how many trades, barters, donations of materials and such we can manage to acquire. The BC Renaissance Festival can cost us an additional $25,000.00 to $35,000.00 over the amount in the bank.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>All over North America, with the appropriate support, Renaissance Festivals have increased Tourism and provided seasonal artistic jobs for many. They have also provided a safe unique space for stage shows performers, cultural presenters, hobby groups and and educational factions to present to the public their world and their talents. With The BC Renaissance Festival’s success story, we would, over time, have a permanent site ‘themepark’. With that we would be combining the much loved traits of the other North American renfests (bringing in tourism) with a taste of the talent here in BC to the renfest circuit (Giving regulars on the circuit the chance to see us shine). With that success that leads to a permanent site we will be in a position to switch long time dedicated volunteers to a paid (honourarium or per hour or percentage - depending) position, bring in performers on the circuit to add to our local talent base and with that create an even more viable entertainment and tourism product.</p>

<p>The issue of elderly care is currently inescapable. Cuts, the privatisation of the NHS and the recent Francis enquiry have brought care into the spotlight and into the media.</p>
<p>Take Care is piece of verbatim theatre that makes the political personal, giving a voice to the carers of the elderly that usually go unheard. The results of the interviews that we conducted have resulted in a captivating piece, in turn both horrific and humane.</p>
<p>We hope that Take Care will encourage discussion on the issue of care and continue to force care into the public conscience. The production engages with the voices of carers and the truths that they have to tell - something that the media has either failed to do or simply not bothered. </p>
<p>Thus, we need to make sure as many people can see this performance as possible. The money which you generously donate will go towards advertising,insurances, printing and venue at the Edinburgh Fringe. Any additional money will be used to help Take Care tour to many other venues. Please donate to this worthy cause, and if you are a carer of the elderly and would be willing to speak with us, we would be so pleased to talk to you. Thank you.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We would like to thank the University of Warwick Theatre Studies department for awarding us the Clive Barker for £600. This money will be used registering the show for £295, and the remaninging £305 shall be used on the venue.</p>
<ul>
<li>£295 of the funds we raise will go on the venue.</li>
<li>£200-250 will go on the printing of flyers and posters.</li>
<li>£100-150 of funds raised will go to insuring the show.</li>
<li>We aim to raise £200 as a float, for any hidden or unexpected costs. We will update the programme when we become aware of these to make sure you are in the loop.</li>
</ul><p>PERKS!!</p>

<p> </p></div>","Short Summary
The issue of elderly care is currently inescapable. Cuts, the privatisation of the NHS and the recent Francis enquiry have brought care into the spotlight and into the media.
Take Care is piece of verbatim theatre that makes the political personal, giving a voice to the carers of the elderly that usually go unheard. The results of the interviews that we conducted have resulted in a captivating piece, in turn both horrific and humane.
We hope that Take Care will encourage discussion on the issue of care and continue to force care into the public conscience. The production engages with the voices of carers and the truths that they have to tell - something that the media has either failed to do or simply not bothered. 
Thus, we need to make sure as many people can see this performance as possible. The money which you generously donate will go towards advertising,insurances, printing and venue at the Edinburgh Fringe. Any additional money will be used to help Take Care tour to many other venues. Please donate to this worthy cause, and if you are a carer of the elderly and would be willing to speak with us, we would be so pleased to talk to you. Thank you.
What We Need & What You Get
We would like to thank the University of Warwick Theatre Studies department for awarding us the Clive Barker for £600. This money will be used registering the show for £295, and the remaninging £305 shall be used on the venue.

£295 of the funds we raise will go on the venue.
£200-250 will go on the printing of flyers and posters.
£100-150 of funds raised will go to insuring the show.
We aim to raise £200 as a float, for any hidden or unexpected costs. We will update the programme when we become aware of these to make sure you are in the loop.
PERKS!!

Donate £10 or more and you will recieve a thank you card created by the Ecoute team.
Donate £15 or more and receive a thank you card and a poem crafted by the wonderful Ecoute team.
Donate £30 or more and receive a completely unique hand drawn poster of Take Care created by our very talented Zoe from Ecoute theatre.

<p>Hello! My name is Micaela Gardner. I am a dancer, choreographer and director. I am from the Southwest &amp; of Hispanic and Scottish descent. I live in Northern New Mexico, where one branch of my family has been for about 350 years. I choreograph site dance works for The New Mexico School for the Arts, as well as create my own works- rendered in live performance &amp; video.</p>
<p>My background in dance is thorough and varied- I studied classically from ages 7 to 17, then absorbed myself with modern and folk forms, such as Butoh, Afro-Haitian and Release Technique. I began making my own dances at 18 &amp; have worked often, but not exclusively, in a solo format since then. My work is described as combining the expressionistic tradition of ausdruckstanz, (German Expressionist Dance), with contemporary urban &amp; modern dance- focused in form, story &amp; musicality. I am particularly interested in site-specific works, unusual dance installations and dance film.</p>
<p>I am excited to be building a full-length, full-cast site work, destined for The Federal Plaza Park in Santa Fe. There will be 3 performances, September 20, 21 &amp; 22, 2013-<strong>all free to the public!</strong> The piece, 'MindSight-The Federal Dances', features 8 dances &amp; a cast of 15. These dances refer to the rich and tangled cultural history of this region &amp; the site itself, with themes drawn from the Spanish Colonial, Native American and Anglo-American interface of traditions &amp; endeavors peculiar to the area. Supported by the rich and lively compositions of Daniel Murphy, the work ranges from quiet solos to athletic full-cast romps. The dances are costumed rather uniformly &amp; minimally &amp; arranged often chorically to suggest an every-human kind of atmosphere. The narratives blend cultural, human perspectives with an interest in diffusing the racism &amp; absolutism prevalent in any colonial story. The short video above shows an earlier, work-in-progress version of one of the piece's characters-representing a misty sort of time concept wherein past, present &amp; future mingle in confluence-suggesting the impact of now on then &amp; then on now... <strong>I believe deeply in making &amp; presenting this work &amp; enjoy a beautiful group of dancers &amp; artists who feel committed to realizing it with me!</strong></p>

<p>Charles tells his story, not all of it, but how he ended up in jail. On this nocturlogical journey we meet different versions of Karl Nimeni as understood by Charles, a man he might have never met, and a Dancer who represents a primitive longing in Charles, beyond rationality and logic.</p>
<p>Through dialogue, movement, sound and projection we learn who Charles Fleming truly is, we discover the teachings of Karl Nimeni and we (whoever we are) leave the theatre with more questions then when we arrived.</p>
<p><strong><em>KARL NIMENI IS NOT DEAD – I KILLED KARL NIMENI</em></strong><strong> </strong>is a night play, a theatrical poem, a moment in time and a narrative dream. It is a play that is more than it seems and less than is known.</p>
<p>Founded in the Summer of 2012, the Nimeni-Kolleg includes 8 core members but is open for collaboration with other scientists, artists and collectives.

<p><strong>About <em>WAR SUM UP</em> – A Manga Opera on the Nature of War</strong><br/>- <em>by artistic director Kirsten Dehlholm</em></p>
<p>War is as simple and as complicated as man itself. The nature of war is ever-changing, adapting to the era’s usable weapons and to the culture within which it takes place. War develops new technology, new strategies, new opinions.</p>
<p><em>WAR SUM UP</em> tells the story and consequences of war through three main characters:</p>
<p>The Soldier is sent home from war. He suffers from PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) and he no longer feels at home in civilian society. He returns to the war and dies in an explosion. A monument is raised in his memory. His symptoms and fate exist today.</p>
<p>The Warrior is killed in battle. His unnatural death prevents his soul from a natural transition to the world on the other side. He becomes a spectre, a ghost, who must tell his story in order to find peace. An old superstition which still exists in many cultures.</p>
<p>The Spy is captured in the war. In order to be freed she must relearn her abilities in the martial arts and transform herself. She is transformed into a super-woman and escapes. She is a part of the fantasy-genre and popular culture.</p>
<p>All three stories are framed by the woman in yellow. She is the Gamemaster who begins the war. But she is also the person who perpetually continues working because everyday life must go on as a banality of evil even though there is a war. And she is the Gamemaster, who returns to start a new war.</p>
<p>Each story is intensified and enlarged when the voices of the Civilians are heard, as a large choir. Light and dark, colours and patterns in black and white together with manga drawings in XL format are other intense narrators. The space keeps the scene in a frame that opens up towards the rear at the end of the performance. The music and images drive the story forward while the words which are sung hit the story with the deep tone of poetry.</p>
<p><em>WAR SUM UP</em> is inspired by Japanese culture and its powerful expressions of poetry, pop, precision and brutality. This is illustrated through the music, the song texts, the costumes and the universe of images. <br/>The libretto is created with texts from Noh-theatre, written by Japanese masters, which are sung in Japanese.</p>
<p><em>WAR SUM UP</em> combines several musical expressions and styles. New composed classical music creates a spheric, electronic sound image. Newly written pop-music describes the three characters with a mix of chamber pop and electronica, where man and machine melt together. The old world meets with the new, when old texts unfold in the electronic universe in order to tell the never-ending story of the nature of war.</p>

The Warrior is killed in battle. His unnatural death prevents his soul from a natural transition to the world on the other side. He becomes a spectre, a ghost, who must tell his story in order to find peace. An old superstition which still exists in many cultures.
The Spy is captured in the war. In order to be freed she must relearn her abilities in the martial arts and transform herself. She is transformed into a super-woman and escapes. She is a part of the fantasy-genre and popular culture.
All three stories are framed by the woman in yellow. She is the Gamemaster who begins the war. But she is also the person who perpetually continues working because everyday life must go on as a banality of evil even though there is a war. And she is the Gamemaster, who returns to start a new war.
Each story is intensified and enlarged when the voices of the Civilians are heard, as a large choir. Light and dark, colours and patterns in black and white together with manga drawings in XL format are other intense narrators. The space keeps the scene in a frame that opens up towards the rear at the end of the performance. The music and images drive the story forward while the words which are sung hit the story with the deep tone of poetry.
WAR SUM UP is inspired by Japanese culture and its powerful expressions of poetry, pop, precision and brutality. This is illustrated through the music, the song texts, the costumes and the universe of images. The libretto is created with texts from Noh-theatre, written by Japanese masters, which are sung in Japanese.
WAR SUM UP combines several musical expressions and styles. New composed classical music creates a spheric, electronic sound image. Newly written pop-music describes the three characters with a mix of chamber pop and electronica, where man and machine melt together. The old world meets with the new, when old texts unfold in the electronic universe in order to tell the never-ending story of the nature of war.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Cassandra Rose. I'm a Chicago based playwright, dramaturg, artistic director, and literary manager. In the past six years that I've lived in Chicago, I have worked with Chicago Dramatists, Victory Gardens, Redtwist Theatre, Steep Theatre, and Jackalope Theatre. I even started my own theatre company, Cold Basement Dramatics, which is dedicated to producing theatre about the things we hide from ourselves and others. Recently I was accepted into a pretty competitive program called the Kenyon Playwrights Conference, part of the Kenyon Summer Institute.  It is hosted by Kenyon College in Gambier, OH and will include lectures and seminars taught by theatre professionals from The Atlantic Theatre Company (New York), The Hampstead Theatre (London), and Steppenwolf Theatre (Chicago). For more information about the conference check out <a href=""http://www.kenyoninstitute.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kenyoninstitute.org</a>. I am thrilled and excited to be a part of the inaugural year of this gorgeous program, but I need your help to get me all the way there.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span>Think of this project as a merit-based scholarship. The Kenyon Playwrights Conference normally costs $2000. That cost includes housing, workshops, seminars, play readings, and all meals. Kenyon College has graciously granted me a $1000 scholarship based on financial need and my writing prowess. Unfortunately, while I love my day job, it does not provide the financial security to take a week off from work AND pull $1000 from savings. From the beginning of my application process I committed to paying at least the $500 deposit, and I stick by that assertion now. Therefore my goal of $500 is to cover the difference in tuition due and cash available. If I go over my $500 goal, wonderful! That's less I have to bankrupt myself in the process.</span></p>
<p>Basically, I want to write a ton of plays for a ton of people. You give me a random page in the Random House Webster's dictionary, and I write you a play based on one of the words from the page. THe length of you play depends on you donation.</p>
<p><strong>Between April 5th and May 5th: 30 one page plays will be written.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Between May 6th and June 7th: up to 25 three page plays will be written on weekdays, and 5 ten minute plays will be written on weekends.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Between June 29th and July 28th: up to 5 bonus ten minute plays will be written on weekends.</strong></p>
<p>What exactly could I write in one page? Here's an example from my full length play, <em>At His Best:</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>ANN and BROGAN lay on the couch together. ANN is awake. BROGAN isn’t. When ANN is sure that BROGAN is still asleep, she slips smoothly away from him. She gets as far as the wedding dress hanging on the door to the bedroom. She touches the fabric but doesn’t feel it.</p>
<p>BROGAN<br/>Are you still going to marry him?</p>
<p>ANN<br/>Yes.</p>
<p>BROGAN<br/>Are you sure?</p>
<p>ANN’s reply is in her hand against silk.</p>
<p>BROGAN (CONT’D)<br/>Come back to me, Annie.</p>
<p>ANN<br/>I should get ready.</p>
<p>BROGAN<br/>Just one more time.</p>
<p>ANN<br/>You should go.</p>
<p>BROGAN<br/>Annie. . .</p>
<p>ANN<br/>Please, Brogan. I don’t want to think about this anymore.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the end of the summer all plays written will be given a once over and turned into a complete collection. You can reserve a paperback copy of that book through your donation.So what do you say? Check out the perk levels to your right for more info!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With this Kenyon Playwrights Conference, I will be able to meet and work with playwrights, literary managers, and artistic directors from all across the country and the world. It's a week of not worrying about a day job, outside projects, housekeeping, or the hustle and bustle of Chicago. It's a week of pure theatre.

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>Well that's an easy one! We're <strong>Distilled Theatre Company</strong>!  Founded in January of 2012 by two NYU Educational Theatre graduates, Lisha Brown and Liz Regan, Distilled Theatre strives to <span>produce high quality and innovative theater that breathes life into original works. While staying true to the vision of the playwright, our work focuses on new plays that are accessible to all theater goers and generate thought-provoking dialogue.</span></p>
<strong>Liz and Lisha</strong>partnered to provide a space and an opporunity for new plays to flourish. Through our training and countless years of theatre experience, we became throroughly interested in the process of developing new work. We believe creating new work allows all artists involved to use their imagination as well as take risks that further their talents.  It challenges all sides of the creative process to produce something great that has never been done before.
<p>Our company means everything to us.  It is our passion and we work hard every day to see it become a reality.  We are starting from nothing in the hopes that hard work, dedication, passion and willingness to collaborate will kick off the first of many enthralling and mindful new theatre pieces.  </p>
<h3><strong>The Production</strong></h3>
<p><span>Raul Curry has been the captain of the Rubicon, a small fishing ship that docks in Calumet Harbor off Lake Michigan, for 15 years. When a fish, foreign to the waters, starts eating all the game in the lake, Raul and his crew take it upon themselves to make sure no more of the invasive fish get into their territory. What could have been a simple mission ends in <em>murder</em> as years of mistrust and repressed anger unravel on one fateful night that will forever change not only the fishermen’s lives, but also the lives of the families they leave behind. </span></p>
<p><em>Ahoy, Abel Brown!</em> explores themes of fate and the mysterious and deep attraction people feel toward the sea.  The brotherhood of the crew is put to the test when providing for themselves and their family becomes do - or die.  Tyler was inspired to write this play when he discovered the very real problem of the Asian Carp invading the lake and throwing off the balance of the ecosystem.  Additionally inspired by shows such as Deadliest Catch, Tyler wanted to explore what would happen to the community who's method of livelihood had been altered by the Asian Carp, as well as how the dynamic between the characters would change if new characters invaded their established lives. </p>
<p><span><strong>Tyler Grimes</strong> is a writer/actor/educator/bush league space explorer, and recent graduate of New York University with a degree in Educational Theatre.

$2300 - Theatre rental
$400 - script printing (workshopping requires new pages every day!), programs and posters
$500 - rehearsal spaces
$300 - costumes, sets, props
 Our perks are fantastic because in addition to the material bonuses you get, you also recieved Liz and Lisha's undying gratitude. Being able to do this show successfully is a dream come true.  We know you have a choice in what projects you fund and we promise you won't be disappointed with this show. 
The Impact
This is just the beginning for Distilled Theatre Company. This start up money will allow us to start on a great journey that will support many budding playwrights.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute monetarily, that's ok, we understand! You can still help us out by volunteering (we have lots of opportunities!) and donating space, materials, props, anything that might be helpful in cutting costs.

<p><strong>ABOUT US:</strong></p>
<p> We are a group of high school and college students from the Bay Area excited to explore theatre for social change.  This summer we will be producing several creative theatre events; including the play <em>R.U.R.</em>by Karel Capek. We hope to cover the cost of our events through donations and will donate any proceeds to our nonprofit sponsors in the local community. <br/><br/>Mountaintop Company Productions is an entirely student run organization. That being said, none of the students will be getting paid anything for their time here. <strong><em>We work because we love what we do, and we want to learn to make the world a better place through our art.</em></strong><br/><br/> We are reaching out to those who are passionate about theatre for social change and asking you to give whatever you can to help make our dream a reality.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have a dream. For as along as I can remember, I have been writing, and this year, in my senior year of college, I have an amazing opportunity to see my words come to life on stage for the first time. I have been lucky enough to find a very talented director and producer who believe in my vision, and with the great platform of the Hollywood Fringe Festival, there is only one thing that stands between me and this dream. And that’s where you come in.</p>
<p>I need your help to help me make the transition from young aspiring playwright to produced playwright. To anyone who knows me, to anyone who has a dream and needed a little help to get it, to anyone who believes in the truth art can provide, I ask that you do whatever you can.</p>
<p>I will be forever grateful for not just the financial support, but what that financial support means. That you believed in me when no one else did, at a time when less than 17% of productions are written by women. That you believed in this 20-year-old dreamer, and you were the help that made her dream come true.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>We are Maine’s oldest non-profit community theater, now in our 82nd season. Our mission is to provide Southern Maine with a high-quality, educational, and fun theater experience that is accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>We produce three musicals, two straight plays, and an assortment of children’s programs, workshops, and special events every year.</p>
<h2>Why we need your help.</h2>
<p>Right now, the theater's primary source of revenue comes from ticket sales. We are thrilled that our patrons are as passionate about our mission as we are, and we don’t want to burden them with higher ticket prices. However, our aging building is in desperate need of a new furnace, a new roof, and significant interior and exterior updates.</p>
<p>Ticket sales have been enough to cover the cost of our season, but in order to keep our shows affordable and address the serious repairs our building needs, we need to drastically increase the financial support network of our theater.</p>
<p>We feel the best way to do this is to start an Annual Appeal, however, at this time we simply don’t have the wiggle room in our budget to foot the upfront costs, such as printing and postage.</p>
<h2>When will the Annual Campaign take place?</h2>
<p>Our Annual Appeal will be in the mail by December 1st for end-of-year donations.</p>
<p>Revenue from our Annual Appeal will not only go toward the repair of the building, but will ensure the continuation of this historic theater organization.</p>

Both productions will involve a lot of expenses such as venue fees, conference passes, lodging and travel.
Information on Paradise Lost:
This extraordinary production is a visual and technical treat replete 
with stunning CGI, spellbinding puppetry and first-rate storytelling

“How
many one-man plays can boast impressive CGI, puppets and a bona fide
script by John Milton?”
- Christopher Olson – The Link




""Montreal
actor/director Paul Van Dyck has come up with a dazzling new solo
performance art piece... that strikes with the force of devilish
revelation ”
- Pat Donnelly - The Gazette
“Inspired…
Intense… It’s great!”
- Jeanette Kelly – Homerun, CBC Radio



The Impact

What We Need
Everything donated here will go towards paying for travel and lodgings in New York and Halifax, but first and foremost the money will go to paying for our venue fee the fringe in Halifax and our Conference passes in New york City.

</p><p>My name is Joe Costanza, I was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., I live in Los
Angeles, and I am, among other things, a professional actor. I have
appeared in over 70 television shows, made for TV movies, and feature
films-- including Scrubs, Malcolm in the Middle, E.R., N.Y.P.D.
Blue, Cheers, Criminal Behavior, Freaky Friday and Vampire in Brooklyn. I
have done more than 20 National commercials including Nintendo, V-8Juice,
Smart Beep, Snickers and the U.S. Postal Service. I have done stand up
comedy, been a joke writer, and a warm up comic on Cheers, worked in
casting, produced short films and I have worked as a voice over
artist .But my greatest love is the theater. </p>
<p>I have performed in theaters from N.Y. to L.A., directed stage plays,
taught acting and have written a play. It's called ""<strong>ONE
BIG HAPPY FAMILY"".</strong></p>
<p><strong>""ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY</strong>"" is about a highly
dysfunctional family: The Cavatelli's. Swimming along clueless in their
dysfunction and struggling to deal with day to day challenges, they are all at
once hit with a life altering event. <strong>""ONE BIG HAPPY
FAMILY"" </strong>is a play about escape, addiction, anger, love, fear
and self loathing.  <strong>""ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY""</strong> is a
valentine to my strong, courageous mother and all strong courageous mothers out
there who sacrifice their lives every day to help keep their families from
falling apart.</p>
<p>I believe that<b> <strong>""ONE BIG
HAPPY FAMILY"" </strong></b>is a play not just about my mother
and my family: but it could be about everyone's mother and everyone's family.
I believe it is universal with its rich cast of characters, familiar dialogue
and recognizable themes.</p>
<p>What makes <strong>THEATER 4 A CAUSE </strong>so unique is that we will
combine the joy of theater with the gift of giving. Half the proceeds from <b>ALL</b> ticket sales from <b>EVERY </b>performance will be donated to a
worthy cause. Hence, <b>THEATER 4 A CAUSE.</b>  So, we are combining the passion of the
theater with the passion of paying it forward. Please help us to make this
a success. </p>
<p>As many of you know, I have been very fortunate to be successful in fundraising for many causes--- St Jude's, Los Angeles Children's Hospital,
Stand Up 2 Cancer, ASPCA, The Actors fund, Equity Fights Aids, The Los Angeles
Food Bank, Meals on Wheels, Hospice in the Home,  and especially for my
""Into Action"" groups. Now, as a member and Artistic Director of
Theater 4 A Cause, I am bringing my fundraising talent to this fantastic
Theater Company where I can continue my efforts of raising money and combining
it with my greatest love---the theater. </p>
<p>Were hoping to raise $80,000 for this production. We can't do it alone
so I am asking for your help. I am asking all of my friends to ask all of their
friends to help make this campaign a success. </p>
<p>The money raised will go towards a production of ""<strong>One Big Happy
Family</strong>"", theater rental, set creation,  materials,
publicity, costumes, props, stipends for union actors and all other related production expenses. </p>
<p>If 80 of my friends on my Facebook page who love the theater ask 40 of
their Facebook friends who love the theater and you can get them to donate
just $25 (but please feel free to donate anything you'd like) we will
reach our goal in no time. If you just give <b>Theater 4 A Cause and ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY</b> just one hour of your

RISKS AND CHALLENGES
Every production has risks and challenges.  Heck, that's one of the biggest reasons why we do it! There's a reason we call ourselves Knife Edge Productions. That being said, we are setting ourselves up for success because if there is one thing that is certain, it's that the production will only be as GREAT as the people who are involved in it.  To that end, every single person that is involved in this production is GREAT at what they do.  
Also, did we mention that ""Fault Lines"" will be the FOURTH production from Knife Edge Productions?  We have a proven track record. 
To quote Stephen Belber:  
""There are two types of actors: There are those that go to LA and try and luck into something big, and then there are those who stay in NY and work on their craft and hustle.  And these guys (Neil Holland and Don DiPaolo) are above and beyond that.  I mean, they are the epitome of wanting to put their money where there mouth is, and more, their hard work where their mouth is.""
The bottom line is this:  We are dedicated to creating and producing high quality works that we are extremely passionate about that will push the boundaries as we know it. If you support us, we promise we won't let you down.

BlakTina - Tucson, is a movement festival celebrating Black and Latina (o) choreographers, and was the brain child of Licia Perea.  Our growing success, over the past two seasons in Los Angeles, is creating a buzz and excitement about this inspiring festival!  Join our art force today and support dance and movement artists of color in our community!  


Licia Perea, Producing Director of BlakTina - LA, and Eva Tessler, both of the Latina Dance Theater Project,  are working to bring this new boundary-defying festival, born from the diverse cultural and artistic landscape of Los Angeles, to the Old Pueblo.  


Inspiring Artists of Color of all ages!

This inspiring festival gives local and regional dance/movement, performance, and theater artists, (of diverse backgrounds, experience and disciplines) an opportunity to present and create new work to share with our diverse Tucson audiences!  In this artistic landscape which tends to reflect only a small portion of our changing demographics, BlakTina provides not only a platform for artists of color, but serves as inspiration for up and coming artists as they identify and visualize themselves on stage.  Part of the mission of The Latina Dance Theater Project, is to provide opportunities for youth to participate in the arts.  Along with our evening shows, BlakTina will present interactive performances for student groups from local high schools.  In the future, we hope to add interactive workshops as we look to share this work with other community groups, schools, and organizations.  





You can bring BlakTina to Tucson

Our goal during this Indiegogo campaign is to raise $3000 to help support BlakTina - Tucson. The funds raised will go towards paying our lighting designer, tech crew, PR for this seasons production, travel, space, artist sty-pen, and education outreach expenses.    
Every dollar amount counts:  Both small and large contributions will take us closer to our goal!  And, all contributions are tax deductible and greatly appreciated!


Other Ways You Can Help!
 Artists need to Eat and Sleep:  You can help BlakTina by providing meals for our local and guest artists through gift cards for local eateries and accommodations, and/or donating a meal from your establishment.
Artists need help:  Donate your time and body to the arts by ushering for BlakTina; volunteering to guide traffic; organizing your own ""Friends don't let Friends go to the Arts alone"" group; or offering your home to a nosh and booze, ""lets raise funds for the arts"" get-together with your buddies and Latina Dance Theater Project representatives!

</div></div>","Our Story
URBAN CURVZ THEATRE was founded in 2005 with the goal of creating more professional productions in Calgary. Aberta that could provide female artists, both emerging and established, with engaging artistic opportunities.

In 2012 we are producing Hunger Striking by Kit Brennan, 
running at the Pumphouse Theatre April 26 - May 5.

When one of Sarah's students dies of anorexia, Sarah is propelled into her own memories, taking her from her present day reality as a high school English teacher into multiple pasts: her own past as an anorexic girl twenty years earlier, her Celtic heritage with its vivid creatures and mythology passed on to her by her father, and the world of the hunger-striking suffragettes at the beginning of the last century. Though the battleground may be different, Sarah’s struggle to reconcile with herself is unnervingly easy to identify with.




The Impact
Hunger Striking asks the question: When your past actions resurface with a vengeance, can you forgive yourself and find compassion for your frailty? 
 
This haunting and powerful production combines movement and story to take you into an altered world and deliver an experience that goes beyond the walls of logic, deep into the pulse of the body.
 
Working in partnership with the Calgary Region Mental Health Association, Urban Curvz is proud to present a story that explores the complex relationship between our bodies and our minds. 


What We Need & What You Get
The money we seek to raise will go directly to paying the artists involved in the project. Your donation will help to sustain the future of our company. 



Other Ways You Can Help
Whether you can contribute financially or not, please help us to spread the word! You can share us on Facebook, Tweet about us or forward this campaign to others you think might be interested in contributing or attending the production this spring. 
 
You can also attend our annual fundraising celebration, Curvilicious on March 19th. For more information and to keep up to date on all of our upcoming activities, visit our website or like our page on facebook.

</p><p>Ignition Theatre, widely known for having presented some of <br/>
Central Alberta’s most provocative and rewarding live theatre is returning for
the 2014/2015 season after a two-year hiatus. </p>
<p>“Two years go we made the decision to take a step back to
reflect and refocus.  Having produced
more than 40 productions in seven years and reeling from the unexpected closure
of The Matchbox, we found that we were bailing water out of a sinking boat
rather than simply paddling to shore to build a better, stronger boat.  In our time away we’ve entered into many
discussions with past patrons and our peers to better cultivate our true
identity.  We feel refreshed, energized
and focused on producing the high caliber theatre for which we’ve become known
and taking it to the next level.” – Matt Grue, Artistic Director, Ignition
Theatre</p>
<p>Audiences will fondly remember Ignition Theatre for having
presented some of the most memorable theatre in Central Alberta’s history
including: <i>Tuesdays with Morrie, The
Drawer Boy, Deathtrap, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, It’s a Wonderful Life: The
Live Radio Drama, My Name is Rachel Corrie</i> and <i>Bug </i>among many others. Additionally, they presented several special
productions including: <i>Seth Rudestky’s
Rhapsody in Seth, Deconstructing Broadway, Adam Pascal: In Concert, Miranda

</div> <p>We want to raise $16,500 for our World Premiere production.  Doing a show in Los Angeles isn't cheap, and the money raised will help pay for the theatre rental, rehearsal space, lighting, the set, costumes, insurance, and all the production expenses.   It will also help fund the Original Cast Album recording, which we plan on doing two weeks before the show opens so that we have the CD in time for our run.</p>
<p>We have tried to make the perks really fun.  You can get sheet music downloads, the cast album, and tickets to the show at a <b>considerable savings! </b>There's even a wonderful perk to our Opening Night Performance and the Reception that follows. For every donation, you can get your name in the thank you's on our website.  For a larger donation, in the program, <b>you can become an Associate Producer </b>with credit in the program or <b>you can even become an Above-the-Title Producer!</b>   You get something fun at every perk level and you will be a major part of realizing this dream.</p>
<p><b>Every cent of what we raise goes to the stage production and the recording of the cast album. </b> Bruce Kimmel is not taking a salary, nor is Sami - all money goes to the physical production, the CD, <b>and if we get to our goal and even exceed this show is going to New York!</b></p>

 We want to raise $16,500 for our World Premiere production.  Doing a show in Los Angeles isn't cheap, and the money raised will help pay for the theatre rental, rehearsal space, lighting, the set, costumes, insurance, and all the production expenses.   It will also help fund the Original Cast Album recording, which we plan on doing two weeks before the show opens so that we have the CD in time for our run.
We have tried to make the perks really fun.  You can get sheet music downloads, the cast album, and tickets to the show at a considerable savings! There's even a wonderful perk to our Opening Night Performance and the Reception that follows. For every donation, you can get your name in the thank you's on our website.  For a larger donation, in the program, you can become an Associate Producer with credit in the program or you can even become an Above-the-Title Producer!   You get something fun at every perk level and you will be a major part of realizing this dream.
Every cent of what we raise goes to the stage production and the recording of the cast album.  Bruce Kimmel is not taking a salary, nor is Sami - all money goes to the physical production, the CD, and if we get to our goal and even exceed this show is going to New York!

During our workshop presentation last month, our audience included a lot of young teens and the show really spoke to them.  One young lady said, ""It was like seeing my life on stage.""  The show will appeal to both kids and adults and can have a long and successful life if we achieve what we hope we'll achieve.  The show runs 85 minutes and is performed without an intermission.  At the workshop, this production received an instant and heartfelt standing ovation.
Bruce Kimmel has been a part of L.A. theatre for over forty-eight years and has a very successful track record as a writer and director.  His productions were nominated for twelve Robby Awards in 2014, and he is also the recent recipient of a Mac Award (the New York Cabaret Awards) for Best Song of 2014 for his song ""Simply"" and has been nominated for two Grammy Awards.  His recent production of Doug Haverty and Adryan Russ's musical Inside Out, received across the board raves and had a sold out run at the same theater where we'll be doing Welcome to My World. We believe this musical will be a success, and we hope you'll come along on the journey.
    Risks & Challenges If there are risks, they are only in spreading the word and getting people into the theatre.  And we are all committed 1000% to doing that.  
    

If you can't contribute, that doesn't mean you can't be of help.  You can help us get the word out on Facebook, Twitter and other social media by sharing the campaign (easy to share right from this campaign page).  We just need to make everyone aware of our campaign and our show.
   And that's all there is to it, so WELCOME TO OUR WORLD and THANK YOU for your help!",17.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Groupe RUBBERBANDance : qui sommes-nous?</h3>
<p>Avec le <a href=""http://www.rubberbandance.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Groupe RUBBERBANDance</a> (RBDG), le chorégraphe Victor Quijada réconcilie les esthétiques des deux pôles de la danse qui l’habitent : la spontanéité, le risque, la témérité et l’audace de sa jeunesse, alors qu’il baignait dans la culture hip-hop, et le raffinement et la maturité chorégraphique du ballet et de la danse contemporaine, où il a évolué en tant que danseur professionnel.</p>
<p>Fondée à Montréal (Québec, Canada) en 2002, la compagnie a depuis produit 14 spectacles qui ont voyagé à travers le monde. Sa plus récente création, <i>Vic's Mix</i>, est actuellement en tournée au Québec, aux États-Unis et en Europe.</p>
<p>RBDG coproduit également cinq films chorégraphiés par Victor Quijada, dont trois où il assure la réalisation / coréalisation : <i>Secret Service</i>, <i>Small Explosions That Are Yours to Keep</i> et <i>Gravity of Center</i>. Au fil des années, plusieurs de ses courts-métrages sont primés sur les circuits des festivals à travers le monde.</p>

<p><strong>Présentation des projets en cours</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Résidence de création au Baryshnikov Arts Center</strong></p>
<p>Cette résidence, obtenue grâce au prix Work in Progress Residency Award du Princess Grace Foundation USA, permettra au chorégraphe Victor Quijada, l’artiste en art visuel Sylvain Baumann et le compositeur Jasper Gahunia de créer une nouvelle œuvre au sein d'une institution à la fine pointe de la production scénique. L’artiste Sylvain Baumann a créé, pour l’occasion, une structure architecturale en métal. Celle-ci sera modifiée et manipulée, lors de la prestation, afin de prendre plusieurs formes. C’est un tout nouveau défi pour la compagnie : engendrer des mouvements au sein d’un espace architectural, d’un décor à la fois rigide et malléable.</p>
<p><strong>Victor Quijada et ses collaborateurs seront en résidence au célèbre Baryshnikov Arts Center à New York en 2017. 2 500$ des 5 000$ récoltés lors de la campagne seront affectés à ce projet de résidence.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2) Spectacle in situ avec éléments technologiques</strong></p>
<p>Imaginez-vous au cœur de la ville, dans un lieu qui n'est pas, à première vue, propice à une performance de danse. Sous vos yeux, les danseurs de RBDG prennent possession des lieux. Armé de votre téléphone intelligent et d'une application spécialement conçue pour le spectacle, une trame sonore vous accompagne. Les danseurs vous invitent alors à les suivre dans un parcours dansé où vous pourrez explorer la ville sous un nouvel angle. Qui plus est, l'univers sonore est modulé en fonction de l'endroit où vous vous trouvez. Votre proximité aux danseurs modifiera aussi la trame sonore, grâce à la géolocalisation et des balises installées sur les interprètes.</p>
<p>Cet événement, dont le titre sera dévoilé sous peu, est le prochain projet d'envergure pour la compagnie. Un prototype de l'application pour téléphone a été développé et des tests technologiques sont en cours.<strong> 2 500$ des 5 000$ récoltés lors de la campagne seront affectés à ce projet.</strong></p>

<h3>RUBBERBANDance Group: Who are we?</h3>
<p>With <a href=""http://www.rubberbandance.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RUBBERBANDance Group</a> (RBDG), choreographer Victor Quijada reconciles the two poles of dance aesthetics that live within him: the bold spontaneity and fearlessness of the hip-hop culture of his youth and the refined grace and choreographic maturity that he developed as a professional performer of ballet and contemporary dance.</p>
<p>Founded in 2002 in Montreal (Quebec, Canada), the company has since created 14 dance productions that have travelled throughout the world. RBDG’s most recent creation, <i>Vic's Mix</i>, is currently touring Quebec, the United States, and Europe.</p>
<p>RBDG has also produced five films choreographed by Victor Quijada, who also directed / codirected three of them: <i>Secret Service, Small Explosions That Are Yours to Keep, and Gravity of Center</i>. Over the years, several of Victor’s short films have won awards at festivals in different parts of the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What your donations will be used for:</h3>
<p><i>Two innovative creation projects are scheduled for RBDG’s 2016-2017 season. By participating in our fundraising campaign, you’ll be helping to launch the company into a new era of creation, and also to expand.</i></p>
<p><strong>Presentation of the projects in development</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Creation residency at the Baryshnikov Arts Center</strong></p>
<p>This residency, made possible by the Work in Progress Residency Award of the Princess Grace Foundation USA, will allow choreographer Victor Quijada, visual artist Sylvain Baumann and music composer Jasper Gahunia to create a new work within an institution on the cutting edge of stage production. Each one of the collaborators is deeply involved in the creation, so that Victor Quijada’s movements are set in a world radically different from that of RBDG’s other presentations. Artist Sylvain Baumann has created an architectural structure in metal for the occasion. It will be modified and manipulated, taking several different shapes during the performance of the work. The company thus takes on the completely new challenge of engendering movements within an architectural space – a set that is both rigid and malleable.</p>
<p><strong>Victor Quijada and his collaborators will benefit from a creation residency at the famous Baryshnikov Arts Center in New York in 2017. Of the $5 000 we hope to raise in the campaign, $2 500 will be used for this residency project.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2) On site performance with technological elements</strong></p>
<p>Imagine yourself in the heart of a city, in a place that, at first sight, doesn’t seem to lend itself to a dance performance. But before your eyes, the RUBBERBAND dancers take over the space by their bodies and movements. Equipped with your smartphone and an application designed specifically for the performance, you’ll hear the soundtrack that accompanies the action. The dancers invite you to follow them on a choreographed path that allows you to explore the city from a new angle. In addition, the soundscape is modulated according to where you are and your proximity to the dancers thanks to GPS technology and beacons attached to the performers.</p>
<p>This event, the title of which will be announced shortly, is the company’s next major project. A prototype of the smartphone app is in development and the technology is currently being tested.<strong> Of the $5 000 we hope to raise during the campaign, $2 500 will be dedicated to this project.</strong></p>
<p><i>The premiere will take place in Montreal (Quebec, Canada) in 2017. Further details will be revealed soon!</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Your contribution matters</h2>
<p>RBDG is expanding! The company needs your help to take the plunge into this new phase.</p>
<p>Besides the perks offered in return for donations, RBDG will naturally make sure that donors are kept up to date on how the projects are evolving.</p>
<p><i>If you are unable to donate, we invite you to share this information about our campaign on your social networks. Every small gesture can help!</i></p>

<h3>EXCAVATION in development on Governor's Island</h3>
<p>This week, September 10-16, I have a residency on Governor's Island (NYC), where I am working together with Marisela Grajeda Gonzalez (dramaturg) and Keelie Sheridan (director) to develop my first full-length original theatre project!</p>
<p>This project began with my grandmother, her story-telling practices, and her reverence for her ancestors. It began also with my own grief, my desire to understand intergenerational trauma, and my grappling with my Appalachian identity/heritage and relationship to class mobility. It has become, in part, a story of reckoning with my settler-colonizer ancestors and the violence I've inherited from them. This is a play about telling stories. This is a play about love and longing. And this is a play about systematic white amnesia.  It is part prayer, part horror story.</p>
<p>The project incorporates layers of folk song, movement, puppetry, text, and audio recording -- and draws upon several source materials, including family oral history, <i>An Indigenous People's History of the United States</i> by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, and a series of letters to my ancestors.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536805115/ksufmzbh65u42nvyz8yu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>My Collaborators</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Keelie Sheridan (Director)</strong> works as a theatre &amp; film-maker, choreographer and educator in NYC. She holds a MFA in Acting from Brooklyn College and was a 2016 George J Mitchell Scholar, which enabled her to receive a MFA in Directing at Trinity College Dublin/ The Lir Academy. Keelie has worked extensively as a teaching artist in public schools in Brooklyn and the Bronx and is currently on faculty at City College of New York and Brooklyn College. Keelie has been the Producing Artistic Director of The Ume Group since August 2016. She was a member of the original cast of The Ume Group's Dream Dances (2015), led The Ceíli Ensemble (2015) and directed 'by wing, fin, hoof or foot' (2017), for which she received a 2018 New York Innovative Theatre Award Nomination for Outstanding Movement and Choreography. Keelie is currently in post-production for the short film planet b234. Keelie has co-produced several new works initiatives and festivals, including The Lab at Grace &amp; St. Paul's, UNFIX NYC and the Schreiber Shorts.</p>
<p><strong>Marisela Grajeda Gonzalez (Dramaturg)</strong> is an actor, stand-up comic, writer, and teaching artist. She just wrapped her first lead role in a feature film. She performs stand-up in bars, clubs, theaters and attics all over NYC. Her humor and satire writing have been published in The Belladonna, LittleOldLady Comedy, The Haven, and Robot Butt. As a teaching artist, Marisela has taught improv, yoga, and theater in NYC public schools. She is also a drama therapy trained teaching artist leading social-emotional skills workshops with students of all ages. Currently Marisela is working on adapting a book of investigative journalism into a piece of documentary theater. She is thrilled to be collaborating and creating with this team on Excavation!  </p>

</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>$1000 - Stipends for my creative team for this initial phase of development</li>
<li>$150 - Residency Fee</li>
<li>$100 - Books and other research materials</li>
<li>$25 - Art supplies</li>
<li>$75 - Indiegogo fees</li>
</ul>
<p>If we surpass our goal, additional funds will go towards a small stipend for me and/or renting rehearsal space for future development beyond the residency! Thank you!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This residency allows me one week of rehearsal space for the initial phase of development! During this week, we'll craft the narrative spine of the piece, and use the material we develop to apply for more residencies, grants, and festivals. Next steps include expanding the creative team and adding a puppetry/movement/vocal ensemble!</p>
<p>Having access to rehearsal space is huge. But I also couldn't make this work without the support of my creative team! The residency does not offer funding for this support. So I am asking for your help! Keelie and Marisela are an absolute DREAM TEAM and have allocated many, many hours (and brain &amp; heart space) to this project already. I am so excited to have them on board and want to be able to keep working with them.</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

This week, September 10-16, I have a residency on Governor's Island (NYC), where I am working together with Marisela Grajeda Gonzalez (dramaturg) and Keelie Sheridan (director) to develop my first full-length original theatre project!
This project began with my grandmother, her story-telling practices, and her reverence for her ancestors. It began also with my own grief, my desire to understand intergenerational trauma, and my grappling with my Appalachian identity/heritage and relationship to class mobility. It has become, in part, a story of reckoning with my settler-colonizer ancestors and the violence I've inherited from them. This is a play about telling stories. This is a play about love and longing. And this is a play about systematic white amnesia.  It is part prayer, part horror story.
The project incorporates layers of folk song, movement, puppetry, text, and audio recording -- and draws upon several source materials, including family oral history, An Indigenous People's History of the United States by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, and a series of letters to my ancestors.

My Collaborators
Keelie Sheridan (Director) works as a theatre & film-maker, choreographer and educator in NYC. She holds a MFA in Acting from Brooklyn College and was a 2016 George J Mitchell Scholar, which enabled her to receive a MFA in Directing at Trinity College Dublin/ The Lir Academy. Keelie has worked extensively as a teaching artist in public schools in Brooklyn and the Bronx and is currently on faculty at City College of New York and Brooklyn College. Keelie has been the Producing Artistic Director of The Ume Group since August 2016. She was a member of the original cast of The Ume Group's Dream Dances (2015), led The Ceíli Ensemble (2015) and directed 'by wing, fin, hoof or foot' (2017), for which she received a 2018 New York Innovative Theatre Award Nomination for Outstanding Movement and Choreography. Keelie is currently in post-production for the short film planet b234. Keelie has co-produced several new works initiatives and festivals, including The Lab at Grace & St. Paul's, UNFIX NYC and the Schreiber Shorts.
Marisela Grajeda Gonzalez (Dramaturg) is an actor, stand-up comic, writer, and teaching artist. She just wrapped her first lead role in a feature film. She performs stand-up in bars, clubs, theaters and attics all over NYC. Her humor and satire writing have been published in The Belladonna, LittleOldLady Comedy, The Haven, and Robot Butt. As a teaching artist, Marisela has taught improv, yoga, and theater in NYC public schools. She is also a drama therapy trained teaching artist leading social-emotional skills workshops with students of all ages. Currently Marisela is working on adapting a book of investigative journalism into a piece of documentary theater. She is thrilled to be collaborating and creating with this team on Excavation!  


 
What We Need

$1000 - Stipends for my creative team for this initial phase of development
$150 - Residency Fee
$100 - Books and other research materials
$25 - Art supplies
$75 - Indiegogo fees

If we surpass our goal, additional funds will go towards a small stipend for me and/or renting rehearsal space for future development beyond the residency! Thank you!


The Impact
This residency allows me one week of rehearsal space for the initial phase of development! During this week, we'll craft the narrative spine of the piece, and use the material we develop to apply for more residencies, grants, and festivals. Next steps include expanding the creative team and adding a puppetry/movement/vocal ensemble!
Having access to rehearsal space is huge. But I also couldn't make this work without the support of my creative team! The residency does not offer funding for this support. So I am asking for your help! Keelie and Marisela are an absolute DREAM TEAM and have allocated many, many hours (and brain & heart space) to this project already. I am so excited to have them on board and want to be able to keep working with them.
Please help!

<p><b>What Does Cloud Dance Festival Do For Dancers?</b></p>
<p>As
you can imagine, dancing is not a stable job. People dedicate their lives to it
out of love and passion for the artform. Cloud Dance Festival (CDF) offers a
place to perform, develop innovative new work and test artistic boundaries. CDF
is a place for dancers and choreographers to achieve the ‘One To Watch’ status
from critics, be seen by the UK’s artistic directors and anyone who's hiring as well as create an
audience following. CDF offers professional development packages and networking
and we’ve been doing this since 2007.</p>

<p><b>Should
Dancers wait tables or change someone’s life? It’s up to you.</b></p>
<p>The
Arts Council believes in us and has given us some seed funding to invest in to
become bigger and better – but we still need your help. We need to show
partners (such as venues, funding bodies and sponsors) that the world wants
amazing live performance that will change their lives. </p>
