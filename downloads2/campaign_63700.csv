I' ve been identifying wild medicinal plants and helping to educate others on how to use them safely and effectively for the last fifteen years. After a senior monk asked me in 1997 to learn about the local herbs that were growing here around us and  make them into medicines for people, I took it up seriously until this day. I feel very blessed by God to have been given this service to others and to see how it's helped so many improve the quality of their lives. Now, at an older age, I still desire to keep this herbal service going, but due to economic struggles i can no longer provide them for free and since i work long hrs. at jobs that are very exhausting. I have a plan to start a facility that could help produce a couple of incredible organic herb products; a Cracks and Cuts salve that conditions and rejeuvenates your skin, and a supremely effective massage oil for muscle and joint issues of all kinds that honestly surpasses the effeciveness of most over-the-counter analgesics out there. By launching this small business, we will be able to keep providing Americans one of the things they need most; practical knowledge of <em><strong>how to use herb remedies side by side with their existing allopathic healthcare programs.</strong> </em>Why? Herbs are amazingly regenerating, rejeuvenating, rectifying and generally very safe to use without many side effects at all. <br/></span></p>
<p>First, I must make the product in a GMP-approved facility, following Good Manufacturing Practices. which means that I'll require funding to help me pay my cost of renting  a certified facility, which could be up to as much as $800.00 per month to get started. I'll also need to upgrade my equipment, which includes cookers, scales and such. Lastly, I'll need some legal services to liscence my company which I'm calling AYURVEDIC RELIEF. There are many start-up expenses, and anything you can give will help. </p>
<p><strong>Who I am:</strong><br/><span>My name is David Hissey, &amp; I' grew up in Los Angeles, CA. I'm the son of two elementary school teachers from coastal suburbia L.A.  My parents taught me a good bit about the value of natural living, and I kept that with me all my life.  I've been residing in Northern West Virginia as a monk since 1996 and I'm part of an </span><span id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1355752903354_3761"">Eco-Intentional Community</span><span> in Moundsville. I believe strongly that the Lord (and friend of us all) wants us to live less complicated lives, free from excessive stress and anxiety, and that by using His incredible gifts, herbal medicines, we can come closer to that ideal, and live more peaceful, spiritually fufilling lives on earth.<br/></span></p>
<p><strong>What I Do</strong><br/><span>Through years of detailed research work (from Northern Canada to our Southern States) of physicians’ materia medicas and other herbalists’ findings, I came to realize how natural herbal-based  remedies were THE medicines that doctors gave people and cured people with up until the early 1900’s. At that point, I made my life work to revive and refine the manufacturing of these local and pure herbal formulas, and get them out on the market. Natural herb formulas are really ""SMART MEDICINES"", meaning that they can multitask to support and assist many different functions or you body. ""Feeling is Believing"" and we're sure that you'll be amazed with natural remedies once you try them!  Local residents of the Ohio Valley area who have tried these formulas over the years have urged me to go foward with this production and distribution on a larger scale, so that more can take advantage of them. This is what the campaign is about, ‘Herbs For People'.  <br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>What Your Donations Go For:</strong><br/></span></p>
<p>Your kind donations will go towards helping get us us legal help and providing us a jumpstart in the production and marketing of these formulas to the public (through EBAY and other physical outlets throughout the United States). <em>The following is an itemization of how the funds will be used:</em></p>
<h5>
<strong>1</strong>.<span>  $</span><strong>3,500.00 :  which provides us the capacity to use an FDA certified facililty  for producing the herbal products and other business marketing support. (We're considering using the Advantage West Company in Asheville, NC area. This company teworks conjointly with the North Car</strong><em>olina dept. of Commerce.)</em>  ( The <strong>Cost:</strong> $3,000.00 i for six months of production which includes various other misc. fees).</h5>
<p><strong>2</strong>.<strong>$500.00</strong> for <em>Raw Materials</em> such as Organic oils, essential oils, Beeswax, etc.</p>
<p><span><strong> 3.</strong> $</span><strong>1,200.00</strong><span> for bulk bottles &amp; jars which will allow us to purchasein bulk, reducing our costs dramatically.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>4. $500.00 for set-up fees and legal advise</strong><br/></span></p>
<p><br/><strong>TOTAL NEEDED TO BE RAISED:  $5,800.00.</strong></p>

I' ve been identifying wild medicinal plants and helping to educate others on how to use them safely and effectively for the last fifteen years. After a senior monk asked me in 1997 to learn about the local herbs that were growing here around us and  make them into medicines for people, I took it up seriously until this day. I feel very blessed by God to have been given this service to others and to see how it's helped so many improve the quality of their lives. Now, at an older age, I still desire to keep this herbal service going, but due to economic struggles i can no longer provide them for free and since i work long hrs. at jobs that are very exhausting. I have a plan to start a facility that could help produce a couple of incredible organic herb products; a Cracks and Cuts salve that conditions and rejeuvenates your skin, and a supremely effective massage oil for muscle and joint issues of all kinds that honestly surpasses the effeciveness of most over-the-counter analgesics out there. By launching this small business, we will be able to keep providing Americans one of the things they need most; practical knowledge of how to use herb remedies side by side with their existing allopathic healthcare programs. Why? Herbs are amazingly regenerating, rejeuvenating, rectifying and generally very safe to use without many side effects at all. 
First, I must make the product in a GMP-approved facility, following Good Manufacturing Practices. which means that I'll require funding to help me pay my cost of renting  a certified facility, which could be up to as much as $800.00 per month to get started. I'll also need to upgrade my equipment, which includes cookers, scales and such. Lastly, I'll need some legal services to liscence my company which I'm calling AYURVEDIC RELIEF. There are many start-up expenses, and anything you can give will help. 
Who I am:My name is David Hissey, & I' grew up in Los Angeles, CA. I'm the son of two elementary school teachers from coastal suburbia L.A.  My parents taught me a good bit about the value of natural living, and I kept that with me all my life.  I've been residing in Northern West Virginia as a monk since 1996 and I'm part of an Eco-Intentional Community in Moundsville. I believe strongly that the Lord (and friend of us all) wants us to live less complicated lives, free from excessive stress and anxiety, and that by using His incredible gifts, herbal medicines, we can come closer to that ideal, and live more peaceful, spiritually fufilling lives on earth.
What I DoThrough years of detailed research work (from Northern Canada to our Southern States) of physicians’ materia medicas and other herbalists’ findings, I came to realize how natural herbal-based  remedies were THE medicines that doctors gave people and cured people with up until the early 1900’s. At that point, I made my life work to revive and refine the manufacturing of these local and pure herbal formulas, and get them out on the market. Natural herb formulas are really ""SMART MEDICINES"", meaning that they can multitask to support and assist many different functions or you body. ""Feeling is Believing"" and we're sure that you'll be amazed with natural remedies once you try them!  Local residents of the Ohio Valley area who have tried these formulas over the years have urged me to go foward with this production and distribution on a larger scale, so that more can take advantage of them. This is what the campaign is about, ‘Herbs For People'.  
What Your Donations Go For:
Your kind donations will go towards helping get us us legal help and providing us a jumpstart in the production and marketing of these formulas to the public (through EBAY and other physical outlets throughout the United States). The following is an itemization of how the funds will be used:

1.  $3,500.00 :  which provides us the capacity to use an FDA certified facililty  for producing the herbal products and other business marketing support. (We're considering using the Advantage West Company in Asheville, NC area. This company teworks conjointly with the North Carolina dept. of Commerce.)  ( The Cost: $3,000.00 i for six months of production which includes various other misc. fees).
2.$500.00 for Raw Materials such as Organic oils, essential oils, Beeswax, etc.
 3. $1,200.00 for bulk bottles & jars which will allow us to purchasein bulk, reducing our costs dramatically.
4. $500.00 for set-up fees and legal advise
TOTAL NEEDED TO BE RAISED:  $5,800.00.
 WHY ARE WE RAISING FUNDS?We are raising funds to expand our important work of providing 100% natural, locally-produced items to the people of America and elsewhere.. I am determined to keep this work going and be successful at it.I'll have no other realistic choice.  In a time where practically 80-90 % of what you can buy is from China and other foreign places, I feel a need for poeple like you to have access to high-quality, pure herbal products as an addition to your present health care programs.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Narrative Dimensions advances a culture of caring by helping people discover and express their personally unique experience of health and illness.  We promote personal narrative, self awareness, authenticity, and resiliency to enrich the lives of all those touched by illness, including patients, caregivers, and health care professionals. </p>
<p>We're working to address the more human aspects of chronic illness. We can all agree that for a lot of diseases we've gotten really good at fixing things with medical treatment. But one area where we need improvement is responding to situations where there is no clear road to restoring health.</p>
<p><strong>What we need </strong></p>
<p>We've had amazing feedback from our workshop participants who tell us that they’ve never before had the chance to tell their whole story to people who get it. Their enthusiasm at the end of the workshop is obvious. But as we gain momentum we need additional resources to reach more people in need.                                                                                 </p>
<p>To really take this to the next level, we need to compensate our team for their time and energy to do this work and to invest in promoting our programs to multiply their impact. We need at least $5,000 to cover travel costs for our facilitators to deliver these workshops in Ann Arbor, Chicago, and Pittsburgh, and to create podcasts and webinars so more people can access our content.</p>
<p>The smallest ""yes"" combined with many others really adds up. If you're inspired to create a big impact, ask your friends and loved ones if they would love to see this project thrive. Please consider forming a giving circle to raise $1,000 together!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Imagine you are seriously ill. Your entire life has been changed drastically because of your condition. Healthcare treatments are becoming more effective and there are more options for treatment than ever, and you rely on these cutting-edge medical technologies to survive.  </p>
<p>There is, however, a gap between provider and patient. The personal relationship, or what we call the culture of caring, has been lost. Now that the relationship between mind and body is irrefutable, the importance of a culture of caring is undeniable.</p>
<p>Our primary program toward addressing this gap is the Living Well with Illness Workshop. The workshop itself is a multi-faceted process consisting of inviting people to tell their story to supportive individuals, reflecting on the impact of illness on various aspects of life, and participating in  expressive activities that involve a combination of  mindfulness, writing, and art.</p>
<p>Engaging in a more active role than patient in treatment, participants are invited to a creative experience to expand their view of the influence of illness on their life and the possibility of a creative response. We seek to inspire people to be true to their individual needs when interacting with their healthcare professionals, friends and family, and community.</p>
<p>People whose lives have been impacted by illness will have the chance to take advantage of time and space to reflect on the meaning of their illness for their lives. This caring reflection could infuse more precision in conversations between doctors and patients. This promotes efficiency for the healing endeavors of health care.  At the end of the day, our vision is a culture of caring where patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals, together, understand and respond to three big questions:</p>
<p>1. How has illness impacted your life?</p>
<p>2. Which of these impacts has affected you the most?</p>
<p>3. How do you wish to live from here on out?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest obstacle we face is getting the support of healthcare professionals. That said, the depth of understanding we have of this content will help us to develop a comprehensive curriculum to educate professionals about effective ways of communicating with people who have chronic illnesses. This effort will help close the circle in doctor-patient communication. Doctors and patients will speak and understand the same language.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The Pill Pouch was invented by Kathi Sitek,the sole caretaker to her elderly parents.  The original Pill Pouch was a repurposed piece of cardboard box with each of Stella's medication scotch taped to the left side and the name, dosage, usage and instructions written to the right.  Kathi and Stella used the tool as a visual reference to set up Stella's weekly medication regimen. Stella used it as a daily reference when taking her medication (referencing the pill's visual and instructions). They also used the Pill Pouch as a consolidated source of information for medical professionals in case of an emergency (e.g. Emergency Room visit) or during routine doctor visits.  Kathi learned how important accurately managing multiple medications was to the health and well being of her mother, Stella. <br/></p>

<h3>        My name is Cherice Quackenbush and my husband is Tate Quackenbush and we have a sweet little girl who needs a safe bed to sleep in that will last her the rest of her life. We love taking care of our sweet girl but it breaks our heart that she doesn’t have a safe place to sleep. We are on a fixed income and insurance doesn’t cover a bed for her. We are so eager to get her this bed so Stacey can continue to have sweet dreams and stay safe. Stacey is severely disabled and has 3 rare diseases and that also makes her the only her in the world! Helping to fund getting Stacey a bed will greatly impact her life because she won’t have to worry about falling out of bed. Which is a huge danger since Stacey doesn’t have any of her protective reflexes, those are the ones that tell you to catch yourself when you are falling. </h3>
<p><strong>What we need and what you get!</strong></p>
<p>We need approx. $1200 to pay for the bed which is being built by a dear friend of ours who is a master carpenter and is only charging us materials and a fraction of his labor costs. And his son is going to be arranging for someone to airbrush a mural on the inside of the bed for Stacey to look at =) The $1200 is a huge discount compared to how much these beds retail which is between $6,000-$9,000. If we don’t reach our goal of $1200 by Jan 31st then Stacey will have to wait that much longer for her to have a safe bed. We have some perks that you can get for donating certain amounts.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

She is 38 years old and has two children, ages 8 and 15. Unfortunately, Alma has no health insurance. We want her to get better, but every bit of her treatment has to be paid for with private funds. We could really use the help of the caring community at large to help defray some of those costs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Treatment Details</h3>
<p>The doctors have diagnosed Alma with stage 4 ""terminal"" cancer. We still hold out hope for her. We have started treating her with a very strict homeopathic regimen, which includes a special diet (green drinks among others), enemas/colonics, saunas, special baths, and much more. I am her brother-in-law and not directly involved in the treatments; we currently have a holistic therapist who is administering the treatments after consulting with others who have experience in this area. This therapist herself had breast cancer and cured herself using holistic treatments.</p>
<p>You'll be helping a young mother try to beat this disease. There are no gifts or rewards to receive, other than knowing you'll be doing a good deed. We will use the money explicitly for these treatments to help Alma get better.</p>

<p>Kuai are clinically validated multisport biometric headphones, which are waterproof up to three meters and calculate heart rate, VO2 max, calories, cadence, distance, pace and speed, on land and in water. Kuai eliminates the need to carry multiple devices during a workout by combining a heart rate monitor, foot pod, sport watch, MP3 player and virtual coach into one comfortable device. It is ideal for any sport and provides custom ear tips to suit each different sport.</p>
<p>Users can download professional training plans for a multitude of sports to train smarter and safer, while voice feedback and configurable voice alerts inform users about their heart rate, speed, cadence, distance, laps, calorie burn rate, etc. Kuai allows users to listen to music, answer phone calls and access detailed performance data during or after workouts and share it with friends and coaches using he Kuai platform or exporting the data using .FIT format used by all the mayor sport apps .</p>
<p>Kuai is compatible with Bluetooth Smart (BLE) and ANT+ and features desktop apps for PC and Mac and mobile apps for iOS and Android devices. Kuai offers 8GB of memory to store music, workouts and training plans, plus a 7-hour battery life.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>HOW DOES KUAI WORK?</b></p>
<p>Clinically validated by Duke University, Kuai monitors users’ biometrics and sport performance using sensor technology.</p>
<p>Users have the ability to train while listening to their favorite music with the integrated MP3 player or by connecting to their phone. Kuai uses quality stereo sound and includes ear tips for different sports made of medical-grade silicone. Easy to use, Kuai only has two navigation switches to control all the sport and music functions, and has the ability to operate autonomously without a phone connection.</p>
<p>Kuai can connect to other devices using Bluetooth,  BLE and ANT+. Performance data is stored in the cloud to sync across all Kuai platforms and saved in .fit format to sync with other fitness apps.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>CLINICALLY VALIDATED?</b></p>
<p>Yes, in partnership with the Duke University Center for Living, the performance of the biometrics used in Kuai was tested versus benchmark ECG and indirect calorimetry (measurement of heat produced by physical changes) sensors. The final results showed that the sensor technology used by Kuai measures heart rate and predicts energy expenditure accurately, with a low standard deviation for heart rate of ±4 percent and energy expenditure (or calories burned) of ±7 percent. Considering that the machine errors of the ECG and gas exchange analysis devices are within a standard deviation of ±3%, it have been determined that the technology is accurate when compared with clinical gold standards.</p>
<p>In studies carried out by North Carolina Wesleyan College and Campbell University, 40 participants completed a dynamic protocol that included 15.5 minutes combining sitting, standing, walking and running on the treadmill using the biometric technology inside Kuai. The results showed a significant positive correlation compared to twelve lead ECG, 95 percent of data points (74,440 total data points) were within the 95 percent confidence interval and a low standard deviation of ±4.43 percent with respect to ECG.</p>
<p><b>HOW DO THE SENSORS WORK?</b></p>
<p>The optical infrared (IR) emitter shines infrared light on the region of the ear between the anti-tragus and concha. The vast majority of the light travels through the skin and never reaches the detector. Some light is absorbed by the skin and never reach the detector. Some light is reflected directly off the surface of the skin causing signal noise. A tiny amount of light will enter the tissue, be modulated by the blood flow, and scatter back out to the optical detector. This is the heart rate signal our sensors cleverly use to give you super accurate data that is clinically validated by Duke University.</p>
<p><b>SENSORS IN THE EAR?</b></p>
<p>Yes! The ear region is an ideal location for measuring vital parameters. The carotid artery system runs perpendicularly along the ear canal region and a capillary system runs across the antitragus and earlobe, providing access to blood flow and heart rate through PPG. Because a user’s ear is generally well protected and does not move excessively during running or exercise, it is a stable platform for physiological measurements.</p>
<p><b>WHAT IS THE PHOTOPLETHYSMOGRAPHY METHOD?</b></p>
<p>Kuai uses a photoplethysmography (PPG) method, a non-invasive optical technique used in medical devices for measuring blood oxygen saturation through the detection of blood volume changes. Using the PPG method, light is shined on the surface of a person’s skin and an optical detector resting on top of the skin measures changes in scattered light from the skin and blood. These changes in scattered light create a waveform with each heartbeat.</p>
<p>The PPG waveform is a pulsatile (‘AC’) physiological waveform attributed to changes in blood volume with each heartbeat. This waveform is superimposed on a slowly varying (‘DC’) baseline that changes with respiration, nervous system activity and thermoregulation. Applying PPG, Kuai uses a sensor technology inside the earbud that directly measures changes in scattered light from the ear and uses algorithms to translate this scattered light signal into highly accurate estimates of heart rate.</p>

iBaby Air monitors are on the way to your doorsteps! We hope this is a great
beginning to your relationship with iBaby. Thank you again for believing in our
vision and backing our campaign.Recent Awards:ATTENTION FUTURE BACKERS:Thank you for your support! Please make sure to read the updates frequently. We decided to change the name of the product for light wood and dark wood models to 'AirSense'. Rest assure, there is no change to the product features. The product is still designed and manufactured by iBaby. Below, you can see how the future orders will look. For any questions, feel free to contact us at elnaz.sarraf (at) ibabylabs (dot) comWhat Is iBaby Air / AirSense?iBaby Air / AirSense is an indoor smart Wi-Fi air quality monitor and ion purifier that detects volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as carbon monoxide, alcohol, and eight other elements. It purifies the air with negative ions, tracks your air quality and allows you to create charts and see changes over time. Best of all, there's no cleaning, maintenance, or replaceable parts (like filters)!Why Did We Create iBaby Air / AirSense?
Traveling the world, the iBaby team could not help but notice the air pollution that people have to live with. The unfortunate state of air quality led us to research air pollution in big cities.We learned that in the US, air pollution is responsible for increased number of visits to ER, hospitalization with respiratory illnesses, and even tens of thousands of deaths every year, especially in children.iBaby Air / AirSense Was Created To Make A Difference
With no comprehensive indoor air monitors on the market, our team decided to take the lead on the project. We believe that creating awareness about the air you breathe and knowing how it may be affecting you, will help people make informed decisions about their lifestyle. Let us help you have fresh and clean air indoors with iBaby Air / AirSense monitor.

iBaby Air / AirSense Has Two Beautiful Wood Patterns For Your Interior

We do not believe in ‘one size fits all’ solutions. That’s why we are offering iBaby Air / AirSense in three colors: pure white, light wood, and dark wood. We found that adding the wood pattern to the product gives it a warm, homey feel that people enjoy. 


We love light wood pattern for minimalist interiors with lots of sunlight, and the dark wood pattern for ornate interiors or offices. 

The World's Smallest Air Purifier Up Close
iBaby Air / AirSense is only 6 inches tall, but don’t be fooled by its compact appearance! The monitor is packed with useful features and is extremely easy to use. Executed in clean and elegant design, iBaby Air / AirSense will be a timeless addition to any interior. 
iBaby Air / AirSense is Not Just A Monitor, It Is The Smallest Ion Purifier On The MarketOne of the features that sets iBaby Air / AirSense apart from other monitors is the fact that it has an ion purifier. But it's not just an ion purifier, it's the smallest one on the market. It is small and light enough to accompany you on trips, and is compatible with different electricity currents.  Select From Millions of Colors Through The App
Danger Around You That You Might Not See
People may not realize that many common household items can cause severe health damage with prolonged exposure. Children are especially vulnerable to VOCs due to their physiology and other factors. As a result, children are not able to process the chemicals as effectively as adults are. Using iBaby Air / AirSense can help their sensitive systems to deal with the indoor pollution better. 








What Does iBaby Air / AirSense Track?
There are several common pollutants that are found all over the US. Most of them are invisible and odorless.


iBaby Air / AirSense will keep you informed about the air quality indoors. The app will send you the following alerts: 
Superb when the air is great, 
Poor when the air quality worsens, 
Oops! when the air quality is low,
Alert when you need to take immediate measures towards your air quality.




iBaby Air / AirSense Offers A Ton Of Useful Features


Ion Purifier Test Results In Our Lab

In our lab experiments, negative ions released by iBaby Air / AirSense removed cigarette smoke from the air within 15 seconds. For an average size room (approx. 300 sq ft), it will take about an hour to purify the air. iBaby Air / AirSense can turn the purifier on automatically, and will show you the progress of the purification. In this video, you can see cigarette smoke completely disappear when the purifier starts working.





Benefits of iBaby Air / AirSense Are Evident And Tangible
iBaby Air / AirSense allows its users to stay on top of their environment at home. iBaby Air / AirSense has the potential to lower health risk for individuals and, as a result, lower healthcare associated bills and expenses.

Not only the app gives you facts and numbers, but it also interprets the information you get. You will receive helpful suggestions on improving your lifestyle and living a healthier life.




Equipped with a free app, iBaby Air / AirSense sends alerts and daily room reports to the user’s mobile device. Monitor through your smartphone or Apple Watch to be always aware of the changes in the environment where your iBaby Air / AirSense is located.

 The monitor features RGB lights that change colors based on air quality, or act as a smart light. Users have complete control over the light colors, can compare historic data, share the data with each other, prioritize which alerts to get first, and always be aware of the environment around them.



 
Who iBaby Air / AirSense Is Made For

iBaby Air / AirSense will be useful for everyone, but especially for those with small children, pets or elderly, people with chronic respiratory diseases or allergies, and those with pre-existing heart or lung disease, as they are more susceptible to developing health issues because of air pollution.








Ease Of Use
iBaby Air / AirSense was created with the end user in mind, which resulted in an unprecedented ease of use of the monitor. The gadget supports both iOS and Android platforms, making it valuable to a wider audience.



iBaby Air / AirSense is Wi-Fi based and automatically picks up the owner’s mobile device network connection, which means no need for typing your network's (probably long!) password. 
The iBaby Care app supports unlimited number of users and offers user-friendly interface with all features accessible at a tap of your finger. You will also be able to add other iBaby devices, such as iBaby baby monitors.
We bet you won't need to read a tutorial to navigate the app - it's that intuitive.

iBaby Air / AirSense And Comparable Products
Compared  to similar products on the market, iBaby Air / AirSense stands out with its size and functionality. The monitor is the smallest ion purifier available, and offers two-way audio, as compared to other air quality monitors.

It would take approximately 2—3 months of my spare time to implement it and then some time for support and bugfixes.After reaching initial goal, every next $10,000 will be spent on adding new editor support. Note that since Analyzer provides custom context UI hints, it will be hard to implement the same level of support across all editors. For example, Brackets, VS Code, CodeMirror, Ace are good candidates since they are web-based and can be easily customized. IDEs like Eclipse and WebStorm are good too but will require much more time and effort to implement. But highly popular Sublime Text isn’t because it does not allow UI customization (although there are some possible solutions).If you’re going to sponsor editor plugin development (e.g. donate $10,000) please contact me first about implementation details.LiveStyle Analyzer and editor plugins will be open-sourced under MIT license. Note that Analyzer contains LiveStyle Engine which is not open-source but still available under MIT license.Who I amMy name is Sergey Chikuyonok, I’m a front-end developer.

<p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p>Hello!  We are Johanna and
Michael Hernandez and that is a picture of our babies, our embryos. 
We got married in May, 2011 and we've been trying to have a baby
since June, 2012.  We always knew we'd want kids right away, but we
wanted to buy a home and get settled into a budget before we tried,
so we decided to wait a year.  We were so excited to start trying,
and the women in my family have always gotten pregnant quickly, so we were
sure we'd have no problems having a baby right away.  We tried everything
we could on our own, months of medicine, counting days, checking for ovulation,
tests and doctor’s appointments, until we were finally referred to a
specialist, an endocrinologist.<span>  We even
tried special diets, and products rumored to help infertility.  But nothing worked.  They told us, with
our combined issues, we wouldn't likely be able to have a baby on our own,
nearly impossible; they said we would need a lot of help.  They were
right.</span></p>
<p>Or initial test results weren't
terrible, and the endocrinologists were optimistic.  They thought we
should start with an Intrauterine Insemination (IUI).  They were confident
that with the quality of our tests an IUI could be successful.<span>  IUI’s increase the odds of pregnancy from
1%-3%, with normal conception, to 5%-10%.  They aren't terribly difficult
procedures, mostly just time and medicine, money and waiting.  The
waiting is the hardest part emotionally, but the money is
hardest part logistically. Our insurance doesn't cover
infertility, so I got a second job and we set up a payment plan with the
clinic.  Three IUI's later, we still weren't pregnant. 
Each subsequent set of test results got worse.  Michael’s sperm count, motility and morphology
went down with each IUI; we found cysts on my ovaries, I was developing polyps
from the treatments, and I had endometriosis.  Our chances of conceiving with
an IUI went down, significantly.  Each month got more and more
difficult.  The doctors told me I needed to relax and minimize my stress. 
But how do you do that?  At the doctor’s recommendation we scheduled an In
Vitro Fertilization (IVF).  IVF is much
more invasive than IUI’s and to prepare my body I needed shots every day.  One shot in my stomach every morning and one
shot in my butt every night, for weeks to months depending on the success of
the IVF.  The shots were painful to the
point of limiting my ability to walk, sit and stand without pain, but it would
all be worth it, if we got pregnant.</span></p>
<p>Just days before the IVF transfer, I
was laid off from my job.  IVF costs $10,000.<span>  After having gone through everything we had
to get there, we just couldn’t cancel. 
It was a risk that was well worth taking and we got pregnant!  Nothing
could have made us happier!  That picture of our embryos was now the first
picture of our babies.  For the best month of our lives we were parents
and it seemed likely we would be blessed with twins!  Then, at six weeks,
we lost the babies.  We were devastated, it's impossible to express such
utterly complete heartbreak.  They don't know what went wrong, just
that they were gone.  They were sorry, but sometimes this happens. 
And just like that, we weren't going to be parents anymore.  After the
miscarriage, the doctor suggested surgery for the endometriosis; he said it
might decrease the chance of another miscarriage.  The surgery was
successful, but showed only mild endometriosis. 
Given the mildness of the endometriosis, the doctor wasn’t convinced it
played a large role in the miscarriage.  Once I had healed, the doctor
said we should try a Frozen Embryo Transfer (FET).  With this procedure, they use the “extra”
embryos from the IVF.  They told us we
had to pay off the IVF before they would continue with FET, so we drained my
retirement funds and paid them off and tried for FET.  Sadly, we did not
get pregnant.  After that, we had exhausted all of our savings and we
were out of money, $13,000 later.  </span></p>
<p>We have enough “extra” embryos for
two more FETs, just waiting for us.  But we can't do anything without
money.<span>  I've gotten a good job since
then, and we want so badly to try again, but we just don't have the funds. 
</span></p>
<p>It is impossible to express what
your help would mean to Michael and me.  How can we possibly convey
the gratitude of giving us a chance to have a baby?  The gift of life is
without equal in this world.  There are no words, no actions, no amount of
money that could ever repay your support and generosity.  The only
thing we could do is dedicate ourselves to being the best parents we can be, to
having the most loved child anyone ever had.  That we can guarantee.</p>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We're trying to raise $5,000 to help
pay for the medicine and costs of two FET procedures.  Each FET costs between $1,500
and $2,000, combined with the medicine needed and the costs of monitoring; if
we reach our goal we'll be able to cover much of our costs.  If we get
pregnant on our first FET, any additional money will be used for
pregnancy and labor and delivery costs.  All of the money we raise
will go onto a medical card dedicated to paying for infertility, monitoring and
pregnancy costs.  </p>
<p>All we have to offer you for your
help is our sincere gratitude, our fervent appreciation and our promise to be
amazing and loving parents.  We promise to keep you updated on our
progress and share pictures of our beautiful and amazing children we know,
thanks to you all, we'll have someday!</p>
<p>Every dollar makes a difference, and
every dollar will be used to help cover infertility costs.  Whether we
reach our goal now or not, we will keep saving until we have enough and we will
keep trying until we have a baby.  Nothing is more important to us, and we
will continue to do everything within our power to have a baby.</p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Every day we see and hear about
people having kids 'by accident'.  How lucky they are to have that
ability, when people like my husband and I, who desperately want to have a
family, have to struggle.  We have worked to have a life we are proud
to bring a child into, and we have so much love to give to them, if only we had
the opportunity.  </p>
<p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>We know times are tough for
everyone.  While every dollar counts, we also need help spreading the
word about our campaign.  The more people we reach, the better chance we
have of attaining our goals.  If you can share this with everyone you
know, you'd be helping us immensely!  Sharing this link on any and every
social media outlet you have access to would be amazing.<span>  </span></p><p><span>Thank you all, for your time and support;

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The enthusiasm of the little Waldemar of four years old, who is about to begin his cycle in the kindergarten, was interrupted on January 17, when a grinder hurt his abdomen and pierced his small intestine, leaving him very injured. Now it is urgent to make a intestine transplant on him.</p>
<p>Dinora Conception Peña, mother of the child, said that in a blink of an eye her child got lacerated with the machine that is used to cut metal, and that her husband uses as a tool for structures of workshop metal at home.</p>
<p>The child is at the Benjamin Bloom hospital in general surgery, and he’s being fed through a catheter.</p>
<p>According to the explanations that doctors have given to his parents, they have to perform small bowel transplantation; however such interventions are not carried out in El Salvador, so it is necessary to take Waldemar abroad.</p>
<p>According to what the mother explained, Puerta de Hierro Hospital, in Jalisco Mexico, asked for $200,000 in order to perform the small intestine transplant.</p>
<p>Contacts have been made with other countries, and a requirement to accept the surgery is that the child and his family are going to be living for three years in the country where the transplant is going to be performed.</p>
<p>In June, there was a collect of almost $50,000 and more institutions have joined the cause, but help is coming very slow.</p>
<p>On April 16, Bloom Hospital medical staff reported an infection in one of the layers of the child’s heart. This happened as a result of having for long time the central catheter - a tube that can be inserted into a body cavity -, through which he was fed. Therefore, some nutrients are injected or administered orally.</p>
<p>In addition, parents make the effort to provide solid food, but due to the lack of bowel, these are removed instantly or are vomited by the kid.</p>
<p>In his innocence, little Waldemar repeatedly asks her mother when he will be able to go home so he will assist school again.</p>
<p>""When the accident happened (Thursday), that day we were going to buy things that are missing for his kindergarten classes because he was going to start on Monday, anyway he's still excited to go"" said the mother.</p>
<p>The hope of this family has been placed, first to God, and then in those good-hearted people who want to help financially in order to perform the operation abroad.</p>
<p>The desperation of these parents from San Vicente, has led them to knock on the doors of several entities, but so far they’ve not received any response.</p>
<p>López Peña's family hopes to reunite the money as soon as possible, in order to pay the intestinal transplantation and save the life of his son.</p>
<p> Those who wish to help financially can make donations to bank accounts in the name of: <strong>Dinora Conception Peña 003500380401; and 003500380627, Waldemar Oscar Lopez, both of Banco Agricola.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Waldemar save life and help the family to perform the surgery and purchase of drugs currently Waldemar needs.</p>
</div>
<div>

<p> </p>

<p> </p></div>","Short Summary
The enthusiasm of the little Waldemar of four years old, who is about to begin his cycle in the kindergarten, was interrupted on January 17, when a grinder hurt his abdomen and pierced his small intestine, leaving him very injured. Now it is urgent to make a intestine transplant on him.
Dinora Conception Peña, mother of the child, said that in a blink of an eye her child got lacerated with the machine that is used to cut metal, and that her husband uses as a tool for structures of workshop metal at home.
The child is at the Benjamin Bloom hospital in general surgery, and he’s being fed through a catheter.
According to the explanations that doctors have given to his parents, they have to perform small bowel transplantation; however such interventions are not carried out in El Salvador, so it is necessary to take Waldemar abroad.
According to what the mother explained, Puerta de Hierro Hospital, in Jalisco Mexico, asked for $200,000 in order to perform the small intestine transplant.
Contacts have been made with other countries, and a requirement to accept the surgery is that the child and his family are going to be living for three years in the country where the transplant is going to be performed.
In June, there was a collect of almost $50,000 and more institutions have joined the cause, but help is coming very slow.
On April 16, Bloom Hospital medical staff reported an infection in one of the layers of the child’s heart. This happened as a result of having for long time the central catheter - a tube that can be inserted into a body cavity -, through which he was fed. Therefore, some nutrients are injected or administered orally.
In addition, parents make the effort to provide solid food, but due to the lack of bowel, these are removed instantly or are vomited by the kid.
In his innocence, little Waldemar repeatedly asks her mother when he will be able to go home so he will assist school again.
""When the accident happened (Thursday), that day we were going to buy things that are missing for his kindergarten classes because he was going to start on Monday, anyway he's still excited to go"" said the mother.
The hope of this family has been placed, first to God, and then in those good-hearted people who want to help financially in order to perform the operation abroad.
The desperation of these parents from San Vicente, has led them to knock on the doors of several entities, but so far they’ve not received any response.
López Peña's family hopes to reunite the money as soon as possible, in order to pay the intestinal transplantation and save the life of his son.
 Those who wish to help financially can make donations to bank accounts in the name of: Dinora Conception Peña 003500380401; and 003500380627, Waldemar Oscar Lopez, both of Banco Agricola.
 


The Impact
Waldemar save life and help the family to perform the surgery and purchase of drugs currently Waldemar needs.

</h3>After years of civil war, Liberians still struggle to gain access to drinking water, making everyday life extremely difficult. And with the government low on resources many communities seek to tackle the problem themselves.The PBS report above briefly explains some of the obstacles to fresh water encountered by many, and with the current Ebola outbreak and state of emergency declared in Monrovia, the country's capital, water has become even more scarce. <br/><br/>To solve this situation, the community in Barnesville, a short distance from central Monrovia, has mobilized and is organizing to build a water pump. The building and maintenance of the pump, done by the people of the community, will benefit all those living in the area, as there is currently no well. But in order to realize this essential goal, financial support is needed for the equipment, transportation and construction of the well. <br/><br/>To get water, people must walk into neighboring areas. With the restriction of movement due to the Ebola outbreak there are fewer and fewer options available. In addition to the distance and scarcity of water, there are also cases of well poisoning in wells that are not guarded, making drinking potentially life-threatening. This frustrating reality makes safe drinking water, which is a basic necessity, very hard to come by. A water pump owned and looked after by the community will alleviate the problem and empower the community, allowing us to address other problems and go on with their lives as healthier and happier people. For this, we kindly ask for your contribution! <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Financial Side<br/>

The whole process is overseen by trusted and known community workers, ensuring that all the money raised is directly and transparently invested in the project. </p>
<p>The total cost of the project is $1,800. The following is a detailed breakdown of where the money will go: <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>The pump head - $800</li>

<li>Water pump machine to clean the well from dirty water - $100</li>

<li>Transportation from Monrovia to our community - $75</li>
<li>Workmanship and construction - $125<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The community will use its own resources for the project, and continue to raise money to ensure the completion of the project.  Money is an important means to reach many social goals, so any excess money will be used for equally important purposes if that should be the case!<br/></p>

</div><div> <h3>Contribute and Share!<br/>

 everyone, and you can directly contribute to the well-being of an entire
 community of people! This is something that will be felt by everyone in
 the community and for large donations we will send a personal card with

retired aerospace engineer and former writer for ECN Magazine. 
</p>
<p>I want to improve the productivity of Real Time
Control software design by making Forth the premier language of real
time. To do that I have designed a Real Time control board using the
LPC812 that runs FISH Forth. FISH Forth is a Flash resident and stand alone Forth that interprets for keyboard testing and compiles for fast running in real time. You can develop software for it on any computer that has a USB Port and an associated terminal program. With the LPC812 board you can control real hardware.
But my ambition and the ambitions of the able ATeam, who have assisted me by writing the Forth and testing the hardware, doesn't stop there. We want to port FISH Forth to
every major ARM MCU over time. We are offering bare LPC812 boards and a
free version of FISH at <a href=""http://spacetimepro.blogspot.com/2014/04/lpc812-devl-20-march-2014.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LPC812
Devl - 20 March 2014 </a>. You can find documentation for the board including schematics at the link. We also have a version of
FISH for the LPC1114 <a href=""http://spacetimepro.blogspot.com/2014/04/new-fish-lpc812-support.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">located
here</a>. The free FISH is your perk for funding, or just

A USB connector supplies power to the board and communications with a PC.  A 20 pin header has 8 chip pins which can be used for general I/O or on chip peripherals. Finally there is an RJ11 (telephone cable) connector which supplies power to and communicates with devices on the I2C bus. <br/><p></p><p>Bare boards and free software are nice. But what I really want to do is to go into
production. Not everyone enjoys soldering surface mount parts. To
that end I have gotten some production quotes. The first step is one
board and for one board I have to raise $2,250 which includes
production, non-recurring engineering and some overhead. Who ever
contributes the most to the $2,250 will get the board. If I can raise
$3,050 I can get 10 made. Suppose we raise intermediate amounts? Say
$3,355. I will get 11 boards made. I will get as many boards made as
funding allows.</p><p>For 100 boards I have to raise $8,260. The per board
price is starting to get reasonable. I can get 1,000 boards made for 
$35,700. And 10,000 for $224,420. Beyond that I didn't dare allow
myself to imagine. 
</p>
<p>If we get to the 10 to 100 board level everyone who
contributes a multiple of $305 will get a board(s).

</p>
<p>For those of you getting boards – shipping is
extra. The time it will take to get boards made depends on the
volume. For 10,000 boards the total time runs about 60 days. For
lower quantities the production time is less.

<p><br/></p><p>So why Forth? I have found that development
productivity using Forth is about 10 times the productivity of using

<p>Weela is launched at the same time in an event of consumer electronics fair CES and in Indiegogo in January 8th 2019. We are now taking pre-orders in and all the investments are used for production costs and for marketing purposes. If we don't reach our goal we will refund all our Backers. And when we reach the goal all the ordered devices will be produced and delivered.</p>
<p><strong>WHY CROWDFUNDING</strong></p>
<p>We have been working on for perfecting the design development, market research and customer testing. We have been getting great feedback from real customers and now we are ready to scale it up with the home gym equipment! Indiegogo is a huge chance for us to introduce our ""baby"" worldwide known. We want to see if the interest is internationally as high as we've understood. We chose presales via crowdfunding because we want to make everything precisely and to secure quality. We've done the whole production already once - lessons have been learned and now we want to make everything even better.</p>
<p><strong>RISKS</strong></p>
<p>We also evaluated the risks for you to explain why Weela is safe to invest in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivery delay - We know this is sometimes a problem in crowdfunding campaigns and therefore we chose the production methods (e.g. effective injection molding, no mold work, no large production lines and no machinery) and the materials that enable scaling up for bigger production fast.</li>
<li>Product that isn’t finished - We are already experienced and have produced one quite similar Weela product so we do know what to do. Our prototype is already ready and only minor improvements will be done.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SUM UP</strong></p>
<p>Our team is more than ready to grow internationally and we want you to be a part of our journey! We will need Your help for scaling up! We are thankful for all the support we’ve gotten from our Backers and Customers. We want also you to enjoy our journey!</p>

</div></div>","NO MORE BIG AND CLUMSY EQUIPMENT FULL OF IRONLose weight, get fitter, maintain mass, increase elasticity, improve balance, build strength or gain more muscles? Weela is the smallest and the smartest solution for achieving your goals through challenging, effective, safe and fun workouts from the comfort of your home! WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE SLIM WEELA PACKAGE? 

Three changeable handles that enable training the whole body throughly. 

Weela device which is tiny, it needs under 1sqm space for workouts and it is easily storable and portable. It makes strength training possible in any room. 
The package includes also a powered cable.
The Weela app can be uploaded from the App Store.
The device includes a resistance control panel and it can also be used without the app. 
   Time challenges. Busy schedules. Inconvenience. Waiting times for equipment. Long way to the gym. Sounds familiar? Those aren't the reasons anymore for skipping workouts. The Weela home gym removes the barriers for exercising. Weela saves you tons of time in your everyday life and saves you plenty of money!  Weela improves not only strength but also balance and coordination which makes your supporting muscles and body control better. Your performance will be optimal to you and you will get results with effective resistance and the PT guidance app!Physical activity affects the mind directly, improving wellbeing and the quality of life! At Weela we embrace all types and shapes of bodies but we also think that for wellness the actions are what matters! We want to make practicing simple, effective and available for everybody.  Weela's intelligent technology is patented. Also the App is a unique solution and it includes over 100 animated workouts so your workout program can be personally customized and starting to exercise is motivating. You can succeed with Weela even without any experience of training! Using the app is easy and it guides your workout with clear workout instructions. Following up progress is easy too because Weela collects the data so that you are able to improve your workouts. With the help of Weela you can create clear goals and plans for how to reach them:  WEELA DEVICE ITSELF IS A SMALL POWERHOUSE!In comparison to other home gyms Weela is more versatile and more effective. All common gym moves can be performed with Weela! BUILD MUSCLES FASTER THROUGH ECCENTRIC TRAININGStrength training with Weela is even more effective than with normal weights when you turn on the multiplier for eccentric training. Eccentric training means that the return move which is usually easier and lighter to do and can be up to 2X heavier. Studies show that since most muscles aren’t used to that, strength and muscles grow faster through eccentric training. This is because eccentric muscle contraction is stronger than concentric contraction, which allows you to enlist heavier weights. Not only can it boost your muscle size, eccentric training has many other benefits! It can help increase your metabolism and repair muscle faster. This is what we at Weela want to offer you, an opportunity to reach your goals faster and safer. Weela's electric resistance is unique, safe and effective. The motion is more stable throughout the whole pull or twist so the performance is heavier than when done with free weights. Weela has up to maximum 110lbs (50kg) of resistance so it sure works to reach strength building goals for anyone!  
Common recommendation for people from 18 to 64 years of age is to move at least 2h and 30min or do 1h 15 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity in a week. (Source: Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans)
In addition to that strength training combined with moves to improve coordination and balance is advised to be performed at least two times a week. (Resource: Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans)
Adults should include muscle-strengthening activities that involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week. Bigger muscles are recommended to be strengthened with 8-10 moves at a time and 8-12 repeats per move. (Resource: Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans)
Medical research shows that natural muscular dystrophy is a big health issue when aging. We begin to lose musculature naturally in our fifties. (Source: Lihastohtori, Hulmi Juha, 2015 Fitra )
The positive news is that muscular condition can be improved even at the age of 90! (Source: Lihastohtori, Hulmi Juha, 2015 Fitra )
The idea behind the Weela was born in 2010 when Mauno Kurunlahti (Dr. Med.), Miikka's (The Founder) father realized he couldn’t find a small sized and multi-functional exercise machine from the markets. Gym training wasn’t for him and he decided to gather a team that could build a machine he wanted. He gathered a team from University of Applied Sciences to develop a machine! A lot of Research and Development work was done and tens of masters theses written during the years. Also Miikka made his masters thesis about the device in the year of 2015. Later at  the same year Welapro Ltd. was established. After two years of hard work the first Weela device was successfully introduced to top athletes and fitness professionals in 2017. Weela is now tested by over 1000 professionals, appreciated and approved by physiotherapists, personal trainers and other sports professionals in Finland. The Founders understood quite soon that Weela got the highest interest among consumers but the first device was still a bit too complicated and expensive for the consumer segment. They decided to develop improved device for consumers. The new Weela that we are now presenting to the audience is so much better that it has replaced the first device entirely.  
We have a working prototype ready of the Weela gym device. The software of the app is also ready. Only minor improvements will be done. Here's our journey and the next steps in a graphic:

That research led to our vision for Bose noise-masking sleepbuds™. During this journey, we became aware of Hush, a San Diego-based startup founded by Daniel Lee and Chesong Lee. Hush was raising money to advance a product vision similar to that of Bose, and the company soon had thousands of passionate backers.

For consumer products and markets that we know well, like wireless speakers and headphones, that’s served us well for many years. However, for new-to-Bose and new-to-the-world products that we don’t know nearly as well, like Bose noise-masking sleepbuds™, we think there might be a better way. We have a lot of experience dealing with noise, and we have a ton of research on how to apply that to sleep, but this is still a new space for us.  So, we want to validate what we know, and find out what we don't, by inviting highly motivated lead users—from among the millions worldwide suffering from the massive problem—into our development process. We want and need your critical feedback and diverse perspective on a working prototype before we launch it to the general public. We want you to help us find any hidden flaws and enable us to better serve the unique needs of a new target customer.</p><p><strong>Why is Bose charging customers to participate in this test? </strong><br/>We are participating in this test with Indiegogo through its “Enterprise” program, which enables larger companies like Bose—as well as previous partners like GE, Whirlpool, Pfizer, Mercedes Benz and Hasbro—to access Indiegogo’s vast innovation user base. We acknowledge that we don’t need the money like a typical startup does. However, quite candidly, we’re charging a discounted price for the prototype because we believe it’s the best way to find highly motivated testers. We believe that testers who pay for the prototype are likely living with a severe “noise in the bedroom” problem, they’re going to use the prototype rigorously, and they’ll provide more and better feedback to help us improve the product and user experience.</p><p><strong>Why is Bose using Indiegogo for this test? </strong><br/>Once we decided to try this new approach, we explored our options for how best to quickly reach a large and diverse population of consumer “partners” to help us test our prototype. With its base of 15 million monthly user views—with most of those users having signed up because they want to be involved early in the innovation process, Indiegogo was the obvious choice.</p><p><strong>How will Bose collect and integrate Indiegogo user feedback about the prototype into the final product? </strong><br/>The Indiegogo platform makes it easy to collect feedback in two ways: via comments posted directly to the campaign and via directed surveys. Our engineers (acoustics, electrical, mechanical, firmware and mobile apps), user experience designers and product marketers will pore over this customer feedback daily. They’re positively giddy about gaining such insight, and they’ll triage and prioritize this invaluable customer feedback. Some issues, like hardware flaws and software bugs, must be fixed before the final product will launch. Other issues, like experiential challenges/betterment, will be considered for improvement in the initial product. And still other issues that have major impact to, and are inconsistent with, the product vision—like music streaming—are out of scope.</p><p><strong>Why is Bose limiting the number of units on Indiegogo?</strong><br/>This test is about learning. We're still in the prototype stages for this product, so we're not ready to produce significant quantities. We need to sell at least 300 units to have reasonable confidence in the results of the test. That being said, we're making a slightly larger number available to collect as much feedback as possible. With the units we're releasing, we have high confidence that we’ll be able to understand market acceptance, validate the customer experience and uncover the vast majority of any potential hardware and software flaws that the product could have. This will enable us to move confidently to production with a robust design.</p><p><strong>How will Bose support the product prototype and for how long?</strong><br/>The prototype will carry our standard 1-year U.S. warranty, which includes online and phone support.</p><p><strong>Why is the Indiegogo product only available in the United States?</strong><br/>We’re confident that the customer problem we’re addressing is global. However, to minimize the time to secure regulatory approvals needed to sell the prototype internationally, we’ve decided to focus for now on the U.S. We expect that the final mass-market product will be available in most or all of our traditional distribution channels worldwide.</p><p><strong>When will the final mass-market product launch officially?</strong><br/>That depends on how well the prototype performs during this test, and the extent of the feedback from the Indiegogo community. We are currently targeting availability later in 2018.</p><p><br/><strong>PRODUCT/TECHNICAL QUESTIONS: PERFORMANCE<br/><br/>Why does the product use noise masking rather than noise cancellation? How does noise masking differ from noise cancellation?</strong><br/>Sound is tiny, rapid alterations in air pressure. Noise cancellation works by adding a second sound that is out-of-phase, a mirror image, of an unwanted sound. For example, in a noise cancelling headphone, when the unwanted noise is an instantaneous peak in pressure, microphones detect this and electronics move the speaker to make more room for the air in the earcup, which lowers the pressure.</p><p>Cancellation is most effective in environments with lots of low-frequency sound (airliners, buses, etc.); in Bose Acoustic Noise Cancelling™ products, it’s combined with passive blocking to achieve good reduction of sound at all frequencies. However, no combination of passive and active technologies reducing sound entering your ear can make unwanted sound, particularly at voice frequencies, completely inaudible. And, when a sound is bothering you—like snoring from a bed partner keeping you awake—you want it to be inaudible. Masking can achieve this.</p><p>Masking works because of the way different sounds combine in our inner ears; if they have the right match of frequencies and one (the masking sound) is just enough louder than another (the disturbing sound), your inner ear and brain cannot detect the disturbing sound. We’ve all experienced masking; for example, at a party or restaurant that’s loud, you may see people across the room talking but you cannot make out their words because the sound filling the room completely obscures them. Cancellation creates quiet in our ear canals; masking—in the right conditions—creates quiet in our minds. One can mask unwanted sounds in the bedroom with a fan that is loud enough, but that sound can then become unpleasant on its own.</p><p>Bose noise-masking sleepbuds™ combine passive blocking of sleep-disturbing sounds with a choice of sounds engineered to mask what gets past the blocking by the eartips. The masking and passive blocking work together synergistically, so the masking can be listened to at a quiet level that is soothing and which fades from your attention as you drift off to sleep. You can choose the masking sound that is most pleasant and effective for you, and you set the masking level to give you just the soothing, cognitive quiet that you seek.</p><p><strong>How is this experience better than with a bedside sound machine or earplugs?</strong><br/>Bedside sound machines and earplugs are currently the two best approaches to mitigating nighttime noise disturbances. However, neither are quite effective enough at blocking common nighttime noise disturbances, especially when the noise source is a snoring partner right next to your head. In addition, with earplugs, there’s an anxiety that you won’t wake up to your alarm in the morning. Bose noise-masking sleepbuds™ synergistically combine the underlying principles of sound machines and earplugs to give you dramatically superior noise blocking, while simultaneously giving you the confidence that you’ll still be able to wake up to your alarm in the morning.</p><p><br/><strong>PRODUCT/TECHNICAL QUESTIONS: AUDIO</strong><br/><br/><strong>Can I listen to my own music or audio books with the product?</strong><br/>No. Bose noise-masking sleepbuds™ were engineered specifically to solve the problem of unwanted noise in the bedroom. In order to achieve a form factor small enough to be comfortable for sleeping AND fit a battery that can support sound playback for an entire night, we made the conscious design decision to not stream audio constantly throughout the night. Instead, we store the sound files on each sleepbud™ and play them back locally, dramatically extending the audio playback time achievable in our breakthrough form factor.</p><p><strong>What masking sounds are included? Why were those sounds selected?</strong><br/>We’ve included 10 pre-loaded soothing sounds with the prototype, each easily selectable via the companion Bose Sleep app. Bose engineered each audio track to maximize masking efficacy and/or facilitate relaxation. Six of these sounds are found in nature—ocean waves, waterfall, rain, stream, wind and country night. Other sounds include red noise (like white noise, but less harsh), airline cabin, dehumidifier and a “spa music”-like drone.</p><p><strong>Can I upload my own sounds? </strong><br/>No. All sounds will be provided by Bose, so that we can optimize the masking and/or relaxation experience for the customer.</p><p><br/><strong>PRODUCT/TECHNICAL QUESTIONS: SAFETY</strong><br/><br/><strong>Will I be able to hear smoke alarms, a child crying, intruders, etc. while using the product?</strong><br/>Bose noise-masking sleepbuds™ are designed to mask unwanted noise and disturbances while you sleep. Because of this, they can affect your ability to hear other sounds, such as alarms, warning systems, people or pets. </p><p>To balance the levels of noise masking and awareness you want, you can set an appropriate volume level for your needs within the Bose Sleep app. The volume should be high enough to mask noises disturb your sleep, but not so high that you can’t confidently be awoken by the sounds you want to hear. If you are still concerned about your ability to hear sounds while wearing the sleepbuds™, you may want to take alternative measures, such as relying on a partner, wearing only one sleepbud™ or scheduling the masking sound timer.</p><p><br/><strong>PRODUCT/TECHNICAL QUESTIONS: BATTERY/CHARGING</strong></p><p><strong>What if my phone battery dies overnight? Will I still hear my alarm? What if the battery on my sleepbuds™ dies during the night? Will my alarm still sound?</strong><br/>Because we believe that most users will set an alarm within the companion Bose Sleep app, we believe they’ll want to be awoken if the battery on the sleepbuds™ or phone gets too low during the night or the sleepbuds™ are disconnected from the phone for any reason, since those conditions jeopardize the ability of the alarm to sound in the morning. Therefore, the product will wake the user if any of those batteries get too low or the sleepbuds™/phone are disconnected during use.</p><p><br/><strong>PRODUCT/TECHNICAL QUESTIONS: OTHER</strong><br/><br/><strong>How do I know if my smart device is compatible? </strong><br/>Your device (smartphone, etc) must support Bluetooth® Low Energy (also called Bluetooth® Smart) to work correctly with the Bose noise-masking sleepbuds™. Apple devices with iOS 10 and newer are compatible, and most devices with Androids 5.0 and newer support Bluetooth® Low Energy.</p><p><strong>Will the prototype have the same performance as other Bose products that I’ve come to expect?</strong><br/>Yes and no. We have every intent to provide the same great experience that you have come to expect from other Bose products. However, as we are releasing the product to be available for Indiegogo testers to use much earlier in the product development process than we normally do, you should expect to find some areas for improvement, as this is the reason why we’re engaging with Indiegogo in the first place. However, rest assured that we’ll ensure your experience will be above and beyond expectations; if not, we’ll make things right.</p><p><strong>Will there be an opportunity to upgrade to the final product?</strong><br/>We are fully committed to ensuring that you have fully functional Bose® sleepbuds™ when we launch it broadly later in 2018. How we accomplish this will depend on how dramatically the product changes between the time you receive the prototype and when we release the final product – which is all based on what we learn from this test. We could learn that the hardware is solid. In that case, we could continue to provide you with software and firmware updates that would make your prototype the same as the final product. And, we’ll do that regardless, as we make improvements through your feedback. However, we could find out that we need to make hardware changes, and that’s an entirely different story. In that case, we would absolutely offer you some type of discount, trade-in or replacement option. After we ship the prototype, start receiving feedback on the experience, and get our arms around the impact to the final product, we’ll determine how to best to approach making sure you have the best product possible. We will let you know what that is through a campaign update.</p><p><b>What if I have a question that wasn't covered? </b><br/>Visit <a href=""https://www.bose.com/en_us/support/products/earphones_support/noise-masking-sleepbuds.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://worldwide.bose.com/support/sleepbuds</a> for more information.</p><p>If you still have questions, you can reach us at:</p><div><p>Phone:            (800) 905-1273  [Hours: Mon-Sat | 9am - 9pm, ET]<br/>Email:             <a href=""mailto:sleepbuds.support@bose.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sleepbuds.support@bose.com</a></p></div><p> </p></div>","Thank you for your interest in Bose sleepbuds™.  This campaign has ended and Bose sleepbuds™ are now available for purchase. Please visit bose.com for details. We want to improve the way you sleep by helping to keep unwanted noise from waking you or keeping you awake. We’ve teamed with Indiegogo to give you the opportunity to try out a prototype and give feedback on our latest innovation: Bose noise-masking sleepbuds™. They’re tiny, comfortable and replace the sounds of busy city streets, noisy neighbors or a snoring partner with soothing sounds to help you fall asleep—and stay asleep. By crowdsourcing real feedback from real people like you, who are living the problem, we can work together to ensure we’re delivering on our promise.Each one of the 7.6 billion people on this planet needs to sleep to live. Unfortunately, while most people appreciate the importance of exercise and nutrition to overall wellness, they don’t understand that proper sleep is just as important. The goal of the team behind Bose noise-masking sleepbuds™ is to help change that. To get started, we need to develop the best product possible. Your input can make it happen.You decide how you sleep. Download the Bose Sleep app and personalize your experience by customizing the settings on your Bose noise-masking sleepbuds™. Select your soothing sound, volume level, and for how long you want it to play during the night. You can also set wake-up alarms. The app will be available when prototype units are shipped to participants.The Bose sleepbuds™ offer a variety of soothing sounds to help you sleep, including nature sounds and other familiar sounds. The sounds are divided into those engineered for noise masking and those for relaxation. Most bedroom noises can be rendered completely inaudible depending on the soothing sound selected and the volume used. By adjusting the volume, you can balance how loud you want the soothing sound to play with how undetectable you’d like the offending noise to be. By taking part in this exclusive test, you’ll receive a prototype of Bose noise-masking sleepbuds™ and the charging/storage case, three sizes of eartips, a wall charger with USB charging cable and a travel pouch. To get a better night’s sleep, start by downloading the Bose Sleep app. Select which sound you’d like to hear, choose the volume level and duration for that soothing sound, and wear the sleepbuds™ to bed. Need to be up early? No problem—just set the optional wake-up alarm in the app.For the past five years, we have been carefully studying the importance of sleep to overall wellness, and how we can address that need with our technology. That research led to our vision for Bose noise-masking sleepbuds™. During this journey, we became aware of Hush, a San Diego-based startup founded by Daniel Lee and Chesong Lee. Hush was raising money to advance a product vision similar to that of Bose, and the company soon had thousands of passionate backers. It was immediately clear that a shared vision and similar values existed between the companies, and preliminary partnership talks soon led to an acquisition. By bringing in the Hush team, we have built on each company’s research and development and made key improvements to our respective product visions. We’re looking forward to bringing the result to market through our worldwide distribution channels.FAQsCAMPAIGN QUESTIONSWhy is Bose testing this product and why is Bose using this approach to gather customer feedback?Historically, like most large companies, we’ve developed and tested new products on our own.

<p>We are Dirk-Karel and Angela. Together with our two young children, six cats and a dog, and with the invaluable help of family, friends and supporters, we are realising our dream to create a well-being retreat in the south of France for people with cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/562536/pictures/original/20121201120911-portret_familie_6a.jpg?1354392557"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/>
</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>Sadly, like most people, family and friends of ours have had cancer. Having seen first hand their struggle but also their courage and determination, we felt inspired by them to do something that could combine our resources and skills to help others with cancer. While supporting our loved ones, we found that they received good medical treatment, but advice about steps they could take for themselves, emotional support and nurture was often lacking, particularly once treatment ended. Seeing this need we decided to open a retreat for people with cancer where they can relax, recharge and re-focus.</p>
<p><br/>We do not have a cure for cancer. We offer cancer fighters and survivors a beautiful haven from the tumult of treatment schedules and the strain of managing every day life, where they can enjoy a personalised programme of body-based therapies, take pleasure in nutritious, healing meals, and engage in activities that can bring lasting inner-peace, focus and inspiration.

<p><br/>We are very close to achieving our dream. This Autumn we entered into the final stage of renovating a ruined, medieval manor house - called Puyssentut. Surrounded by flower filled gardens and nestled amongst gently rolling hills, Puyssentut has become a very warm and welcoming house thanks to a team of experts and over a hundred volunteers who have offered their hands to its transformation. Here we have created restful, homely bedrooms; a comfortable lounge with a well-stocked, inspiring library; a cosy and sociable dining room; an inviting kitchen; relaxing therapy rooms; several sun terraces for that essential dose of vitamin D; a salt-water swimming pool; a juice bar; and extensive grounds to take a wander through, relax in or simply find a quiet spot to sit and enjoy the beauty of nature and the simple pleasures of life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even before Puyssentut has opened (we will open in April 2013), visitors and volunteers have found themselves affected by the convivial atmosphere, combined effort and shared vision.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ciaran - a friend of ours with cancer - had this to say about her stay at Puyssentut in July this year:</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><em>""I can't tell you how deeply touched and healed I feel after just my tiny short visit there [Puyssentut] - partly because you guys are such warm, loving hosts and partly because of the hope it gives me for all the future possibilities I can involve myself in with you.""</em></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Meagan, who was prompted to volunteer at Puyssentut after her father died of cancer last year, experienced that:</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><em>""Puyssentut has been, for me, a place of restoration, in every sense of the word. This past Summer, I not only had the opportunity to help recreate some of the ancient beauty of this breathtaking manor house, I experienced renewal of my own health, confidence and perspective. I found myself amongst a community of people who know that life can be unpredictable and that everyone, at one time or another needs a safe space in which to rediscover who they were, who they are and who they might yet be. I am so excited to contribute to this incredible and important project.""</em></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""> </p>
<h3><strong>How can you contribute?</strong></h3>
<p><br/>We have put everything we have into bringing Puyssentut to life again: our lives, our love, our energy, our money, and even our family and friends. But now we need your help!</p>
<p><br/>We need 190,000 dollars (equivalent to 150,000 Euros) to complete Puyssentut's transformation and convert the ancient, stone barn into a meditation and yoga studio and creative workshop. This space is important because it is where we will offer our guests activities through which they can discover untapped inner resources; connect with forgotten and unknown aspects of themselves; feel supported by and give support to others; and find peace, acceptance and inspiration. Converting the barn into an activity space will give people who stay at Puyssentut the chance to experience something new or find something precious within themselves, which they can take home and into their daily lives.</p>
<p><br/>The money we are asking for is needed to pay for the work that we are not able to do ourselves. It will be used to pay for a new roof, the installation of electricity, plumbing and heating, insulation, and stone construction work.</p>

We are Dirk-Karel and Angela. Together with our two young children, six cats and a dog, and with the invaluable help of family, friends and supporters, we are realising our dream to create a well-being retreat in the south of France for people with cancer.
 
 

 
Sadly, like most people, family and friends of ours have had cancer. Having seen first hand their struggle but also their courage and determination, we felt inspired by them to do something that could combine our resources and skills to help others with cancer. While supporting our loved ones, we found that they received good medical treatment, but advice about steps they could take for themselves, emotional support and nurture was often lacking, particularly once treatment ended. Seeing this need we decided to open a retreat for people with cancer where they can relax, recharge and re-focus.
We do not have a cure for cancer. We offer cancer fighters and survivors a beautiful haven from the tumult of treatment schedules and the strain of managing every day life, where they can enjoy a personalised programme of body-based therapies, take pleasure in nutritious, healing meals, and engage in activities that can bring lasting inner-peace, focus and inspiration. Our aim is to help improve the success of cancer treatments and aid recuperation, and encourage people to take steps in their lives to be healthier and, ultimately, happier.
 

We are very close to achieving our dream. This Autumn we entered into the final stage of renovating a ruined, medieval manor house - called Puyssentut.

<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style="""">Please pray for Bishop......""We have had an extremely busy and emotional week. Bishop had 6 appointments with her doctors at Vanderbilt. I'll try to make the update as brief as possible. <br/>MONDAY: Swallow Study - No good results. Bishop's speech therapist was able to attend to see that Bishop clearly cannot swallow. This was heartbreaking as we discussed the test and as of now, there is no improvement. The report, in detail, sums it up saying she has severe Dysphagia (see definition below). At this time, we have no promise that Bishop will be able to ever eat or drink again. <br/>TUESDAY: MRI @ night. <br/>WEDNESDAY: Oncology - Bishop had her check up. They did not have the results of the MRI on paper, but her doctor did call for a verbal result. Her tumor remains stable, so we will follow up in 3 months for her next MRI. We also received the approval for Bishop to go back on home-bound school part/full time when school starts. <br/>WEDNESDAY: General Surgery - Bishop's g-tube was irritating her, so we went to see a nurse about it. Due to her weight loss, they had to change out her g-tube for a smaller size. She will be taking a new formula next week to add extra calories so she does not lose any more weight (per Oncologist/Dietician). <br/>WEDNESDAY: Pulmonary - We met our new Pulmonologist, Dr. Chadha. He is really good. We discussed Bishop's reoccurring pneumonia and evaluated where she stands. He is ordering a CT scan of Bishop's lungs to see how badly scarred they are. As of now, he does not want any food, liquid, gum, or candy in Bishop's mouth. This means absolutely NO chewing/spitting out food! This was devastating to her. We discussed health vs. quality of life. In the end to compromise, he allowed her a once a day item to chew/spit out in order to taste some sort of flavor. <br/>THURSDAY: ENT - Bishop's ENT scoped Bishop's nose and throat. We can clearly see secretion hanging out around her vocal cords. This is showing that she is still not clearing out her saliva well causing aspiration. He ordered Bishop to not put anything, even once a day, in her mouth. <br/>Lastly, our secondary insurance has been cancelled. The harsh reality of this is that Bishop maxed out her OT, PT, and Speech therapy with her first insurance for the year. This was another blow to Bishop. She will not be able to receive the insured therapy services through her primary insurance until January 2013. <br/>So, not a good week when the best news you receive is that Bishop's tumor is stable. We've had a heart-to-heart conversation with Bishop that we are running out of options. Her speech therapist really had to push Bishop that she cannot afford to keep getting pneumonia and to exercise more. With all this news and Bishop's best friend, Allie, that moved away earlier this week, we are dealing with a lot of dark emotions with Bishop. <br/>We are trying to make the best of everything in order to give Bishop the best quality of life. I even told her that I would give her $1.00/day for every day she does not put anything in her mouth to avoid aspiration. She is one strong girl as I could not imagine what it would be like to never get the opportunity to taste anything again. Please pray for a healthy solution for Bishop.""</span></p></div>","To learn more about Bishop & her story please visit:

Using our combined skills, we found a way that we felt we could do this. John knew electronics, EJ knew marketing, Capri knew design, Mike knew websites and Kyleah can dance her way around Facebook and the like. John had a great idea for a wireless brake light for cars, bicycles, boats or anything that moved. When we started to research its application in bicycles, we were astonished at the need for them. The accident rate was amazingly high - especially for riders who rode with others or in traffic. We felt our brake light could make a real difference, save lives and avoid countless injuries.</p>

<hr/>
<p>2 types of braking indicated — Normal stop &amp; Emergency stop. If you have to stop very suddenly, it flashes faster and brighter than if you are coming to a controlled type of stop. When John has to stop suddenly in traffic, he pumps his brakes to create a flashing effect so that the cars behind him get alerted early enough to avert running into him. He built this mode into the brake light and he uses one on his car just so that he doesn't have to do that anymore!</p>
<p>Unlike other brake lights, it doesn't have to be installed or alter the vehicle at all. In fact, it doesn't require it be mounted on a mechanical vehicle at all. This brake can be mounted on a person or a piece of equipment that is riding the ride. This is the first of its kind deceleration light (brake light) that doesn't have to be fixed to a certain position or to a piece of equipment. It literally just knows what to do no matter what position it is in in space.</p>
<p>The concept of a wireless brake light isn't new, it just has never been engineered to such precision functionality.</p>

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>How much does it weigh? </strong></span></p>
<p>LucidBrake is about 23 grams. Two AAA batteries are also about 23 grams. That's very light weight, and that's why when attached to the back of a helmet people say they can't even tell it's there. Your cell phone weighs about 3 times that amount.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How big is a LucidBrake?</span></strong></p>
<p>A standard business card is 3 1/2 inches edge to edge. A LucidBrake is 3 inches edge to edge, so a LucidBrake can't hide a business card.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How does LucidBrake attach to a bike or helmet?</span></strong></p>
<p>One of the design goals was to be able to mount LucidBrake on a helmet, and conventional mounting solutions just wouldn't work for this.</p>
<p>Engineers at 3M convinced us to try their Dual Lock fasteners. We are glad we did, as these are working perfectly.</p>
<p>Dual Lock fasteners are used to attach metal siding up on buildings in extremes of weather conditions. You peel off a backing, stick identical pads to clean, dry surfaces such as the perfectly flat back of a LucidBrake and your bicycle seat post, back of your helmet, or just about anywhere you want a deceleration light, press together and go. If you park where theft might be a concern, Dual Lock fasteners let you pull them apart so you can take LucidBrake with you. You can pull apart and press together thousands of times.</p>
<p>Each square inch of Dual Lock fastener pads have 250 tiny mushroom headed posts. When pressed together these posts interlock with amazing tenacity. In all our bike testing we've never had a LucidBrake fall off.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Can I take it with me so it doesn't get stolen?</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes you can. The Dual Lock fasteners make it easy to detach and reattach LucidBrake to your bicycle or other equipment as many times as desired.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Is there a power switch? </span></strong></p>
<p>There's no power switch on a LucidBrake. John created some patentable circuitry that reduces battery current when parked in the garage to a tiny trickle. Calculations show the batteries should last multiple years sitting in the garage. Every few seconds the 3-axis accelerometer is checked to see if any change in orientation has occurred, and if so LucidBrake automatically springs back to life.</p>
<p>The batteries are easily accessed, so if you take LucidBrake with you the batteries can be removed to prevent bright flashing red lights where you probably don't want them.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Is it patentable?</span></strong></p>
<p>When applying for our provisional patent we searched for similar patents, and we did find one, by an overseas company. However, LucidBrake does extend the state of the art, and here's why. The other people's patent describes the use of only one axis of acceleration to detect braking, and they go out of their way to explain the behavior on hills and slopes based on the use of just one axis. The very last sentence of their patent is this.. 'That is why this invention is called ""wireless brake light"" instead of ""wireless deceleration light'.</p>
<p>LucidBrake, on the other hand, is truly a deceleration light, and not just a brake light. The biggest difference is that John figured out a way to use all three axes of the accelerometer to eliminate most of the effects of rotations and bumps, while detecting any changes in acceleration or deceleration beyond that of the force of gravity. There's more to our provisional patent, but this shortened explanation is at the heart of the differences.</p>
<p>So, LucidBrake can be mounted on the back of a helmet! (Theirs won't work there as described in their patent.) As the user rotates their head, most of the rotation effect is ignored, yet when the bicycle decelerates it detects and signals it. Also, if the mounting angle of LucidBrake isn't perfect, due to the angle of the seat post on a bicycle for example, it's okay, and LucidBrake instantly adjusts to the new angle. Theirs does not cover this in their patent at all.</p>

FAQ'S




The goal at LucidLights, LLC (makers of the LucidBrake) is to make the world a better place. Using our combined skills, we found a way that we felt we could do this. John knew electronics, EJ knew marketing, Capri knew design, Mike knew websites and Kyleah can dance her way around Facebook and the like. John had a great idea for a wireless brake light for cars, bicycles, boats or anything that moved. When we started to research its application in bicycles, we were astonished at the need for them. The accident rate was amazingly high - especially for riders who rode with others or in traffic. We felt our brake light could make a real difference, save lives and avoid countless injuries.

2 stopping modes (normal stop & emergency stop)

4 different types of beacon modes:


Racing mode (no awareness beacon, 2-types braking mode)
Tail light mode (dim awareness beacon light on all the time & 2-types braking mode)
Cylon mode (bright flashing lights going vertically up and down the sides of brake light & 2-types braking mode)
Rotator mode (2 bright lights that travel around the brake & 2 types braking mode)

mounts anywhere (no wiring at all)

 Why LucidBrake is better than any other brake light.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I'm Robert DePietro 61 years old with a body that's falling apart. I've been told by the ear doctor that i have severe nerve damage in my ears. He was surprised that I could hear at all. (damage from 1,000's of concerts thru the years). My business has been non existant since the recession. I am currently just selling what I can on Ebay and sales are just enough to support me. Jobs with benefits are just not available to me. I am physically out of balance with a contant humming in my ear. I am living on a very tight budget and have no savings just my collection of posters. </p>

<p>
</p>
<p>When we set out to test hearing aids, we 
encountered the same challenges that hearing-aid shoppers face every day: a 
fragmented and confusing marketplace and difficulty sorting out good hearing-aid 
providers from less-capable ones. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We followed a dozen actual patients for 
six months as they shopped for and used hearing aids, conducted a national 
survey of 1,100 people who had bought a hearing aid in the past three years, and 
lab-tested the features of 44 hearing aids. Here's what we found: </p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>High prices</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""pSpan"">Our shoppers purchased two pairs of 
hearing aids each, or 48 aids in all, ranging from $1,800 to $6,800 per pair, 
including professional fitting and follow-up services, in the New York City 
metropolitan area. </p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Mediocre fitting</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""pSpan"">We had audiologists check how well 
providers fit our shoppers' hearing aids to their individual hearing loss. 
Two-thirds of the 48 aids they bought were misfit: They amplified too little or 
too much. </p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Lack of information</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""pSpan"">Most of the providers our shoppers 
visited discussed style and features, but a significant minority didn't. 
One-fourth of respondents to our survey, conducted by the Consumer Reports 
National Research Center, didn't know whether their aids had feedback 
suppression, and a third didn't know whether they had directional microphones. 
Both features can be critical to performance. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>So why bother with hearing aids? Medical 
evidence shows that they can improve your quality of life and relationships with 
friends and family, so it's worth persevering until you get aids that are 
properly selected and fitted. Of our survey respondents, 73 percent pronounced 
themselves highly satisfied with their aids. As one of our shoppers noted, ""I'm 
hearing music sounds I haven't heard for over 20 years."" </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Moreover, hearing-aid technology has made 
major strides in recent years, most notably with the development of very small 
open-fit digital hearing aids. In loud social settings, the most challenging 
environment for hearing-aid users, survey participants reported more improvement 
with those aids, which don't plug up the ear canal, over other styles that use 
earmolds, custom-shaped inserts that fit tightly in the ear canal. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you're avoiding noisy places or having

I'm Robert DePietro 61 years old with a body that's falling apart. I've been told by the ear doctor that i have severe nerve damage in my ears. He was surprised that I could hear at all. (damage from 1,000's of concerts thru the years). My business has been non existant since the recession. I am currently just selling what I can on Ebay and sales are just enough to support me. Jobs with benefits are just not available to me. I am physically out of balance with a contant humming in my ear. I am living on a very tight budget and have no savings just my collection of posters. 
Hear well in a noisy world


Hearing aids, hearing protection & more

Buying Hearing Aids
All 
videos 



When we set out to test hearing aids, we 
encountered the same challenges that hearing-aid shoppers face every day: a 
fragmented and confusing marketplace and difficulty sorting out good hearing-aid 
providers from less-capable ones. 


We followed a dozen actual patients for 
six months as they shopped for and used hearing aids, conducted a national 
survey of 1,100 people who had bought a hearing aid in the past three years, and 
lab-tested the features of 44 hearing aids. Here's what we found: 


High prices


Our shoppers purchased two pairs of 
hearing aids each, or 48 aids in all, ranging from $1,800 to $6,800 per pair, 
including professional fitting and follow-up services, in the New York City 
metropolitan area. 


Mediocre fitting


We had audiologists check how well 
providers fit our shoppers' hearing aids to their individual hearing loss. 
Two-thirds of the 48 aids they bought were misfit: They amplified too little or 
too much. 


Lack of information


Most of the providers our shoppers 
visited discussed style and features, but a significant minority didn't. 
One-fourth of respondents to our survey, conducted by the Consumer Reports 
National Research Center, didn't know whether their aids had feedback 
suppression, and a third didn't know whether they had directional microphones. 
Both features can be critical to performance. 


So why bother with hearing aids? Medical 
evidence shows that they can improve your quality of life and relationships with 
friends and family, so it's worth persevering until you get aids that are 
properly selected and fitted. Of our survey respondents, 73 percent pronounced 
themselves highly satisfied with their aids. As one of our shoppers noted, ""I'm 
hearing music sounds I haven't heard for over 20 years."" 


Moreover, hearing-aid technology has made 
major strides in recent years, most notably with the development of very small 
open-fit digital hearing aids. In loud social settings, the most challenging 
environment for hearing-aid users, survey participants reported more improvement 
with those aids, which don't plug up the ear canal, over other styles that use 
earmolds, custom-shaped inserts that fit tightly in the ear canal. 


If you're avoiding noisy places or having 
trouble in conversation or understanding TV, it might be time for a hearing aid. 
In our survey 67 percent of first-time aid users sought aids because they got 
tired of asking others to repeat themselves. 


Once you've accepted your hearing loss 
and are considering getting hearing aids, your most consequential decision is 
finding the proper professional from whom to buy them because it's likely to be 
a long-term relationship. This is not a project for the faint-hearted because 
the industry is anything but standardized. Our shoppers encountered a variety of 
providers, including hospital-based clinics and strip-mall storefronts, all 
legally able to fit a hearing aid, but with varied resources and expertise. In 
this report, we'll help sort things out step by step. 


 


The Impact
If I can get some help it will help ignite my business again and help me with some business ideas I am trying to put together.It will also hopefully allow me (once I can function again) to hire several people to help me sell.
If I can't get the funds I am very afraid i may lose my hearing which seems to get worse by the day.


What We Need & What You Get
If I can raise all the money I will be getting a $5,500.00 set of Hearing aids for $3,800.00. All money goes to Dr Barry Kaufman (I-45 feeder in Oak Ridge) any and all money will go to the hearing aids. I am ofering perks for donating.

<p>I am Nicolas Pasquier, a 39 years old french entrepreneur with extensive experience in the IT and luxury industries. About a year ago I got an idea that was so crazy I had to follow it. So I founded Skinjay, a company located <strong>20 minutes from Paris and at the north end of the Cosmetic Valley</strong>. As weeks turned into months, the idea turned into a concept then prototypes and finally into the patented products (patents pending) and technology you are about to discover thanks to the help and dedication of a very talented team.</p>
<p>Now we are looking for backers to join our team and <strong>help us build the future of Skinjay Paris</strong>. Back us up and you will become an active member of the Skinjay team and part of an entrepreneurial adventure.<strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;""><img alt=""Nicolas Pasquier - Founder Skinjay"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://castlefrance.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/nico-caps.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Nicolas Pasquier - Skinjay founder""/></strong></p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Time is a luxury. Take time for yourself.</strong></p>
<p>Because we live in a fast paced environment where it is harder everyday to find time for one self, Skinjay created an innovative product that brings pleasure to your shower!</p>
<p>No phone, No tablet, No kids. Just you, water and a little bit of magic in the shape of a small capsule and a patented innovative device that <strong>deliver wellness and organic skin care products directly into your water stream</strong>.</p>

<h2><strong>In-shower natural skin care</strong></h2>
<p>We are looking to <strong>preserve nature</strong> not to improve it. And we don't need to: skin pores do open up naturally under warm water. We simply take advantage of this fact to deliver high quality skin care, essential oils and moisturizers with the best possible effectiveness. Skinjay is not only easy to use, easier and faster to apply, <strong>it is actually the most effective solution for your skin</strong>. All you have to do is choose the capsule that's best for you today. And there are many many many different ones coming which you will be able to choose from.</p>

<h2><strong>Stay at home and treat yourself to a SPA</strong></h2>
<p>Skinjay's goal is not only to leave you with great skin but also with a feeling of peace and harmony. That is why we will create several capsule collections to  both care for and relax your skin, your body and your mind. With capsules focused on relaxation we will provide you with an easy way to cool down after a hard day at work, recover after your daily run or even get lucky with our upcoming naughty caps!</p>
<p><strong>For our Indiegogo launch we are offering you SPA and essential oils capsules available in our Mixer &amp; mix packs.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>So what is the Skinjay Mixer ?</strong></h2>
<p>The Skinjay Mixer is a small sleek innovative device that easily connects in seconds to your shower hose or to your shower head. It allows you to easily insert a capsule and release organic skin care, fragrance or relaxing products directly into the water stream of your shower or your bath.<img alt=""Mixer size comparison"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://castlefrance.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/size-comparison.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Skinjay mixer size comparison""/></p>
<h2><strong>How does it work ?</strong></h2>
<p>The Mixer is a mechanical device made of high quality materials. It is designed to welcome any Skinjay capsule by simply sliding it into position as shown below. Once the capsule is inserted, a gentle 180° turn of the patented one-action wheel of the Mixer will release organic skin care  into your shower for the next 4 to 8 minutes giving you the pleasure to hydrate under the shower, relax with essential oils or even enjoy the soothing care of algotherapy.</p>

<h2><strong>Functional design with style</strong></h2>
<p>The simplicity of the Skinjay <em>Mixer</em> and the fact that it requires only two moves to be operational is no accident but the result of over a year of research and design. We still tried to create the most beautiful product possible and we are actually very proud of its design . The back plate will be manufactured in high-end chrome or inox but the front parts can be styled to create original designs which will  integrate perfectly within any bathroom. For our Indiegogo launch, you can choose between four different styles including the gorgeous Indiegogo limited edition.</p>

<h2><strong>Why we need you ?</strong></h2>
<p>We are currently at our 4th revision prototype of the Mixer and after demonstrating it and the capsules to hundreds of people over the last several months, we finally feel that the products are ready to enter into the next stage of production. We've determined that we can achieve the right price point if we commit to build a production scale of units. That's where we need your help.</p>
<p>Also,<strong> your feedback will be the (second) most important part</strong> of this Indiegogo challenge as it will direct our interest towards one of the many possible capsules collections including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Balneotherapy capsules: </strong>harnessing the known healing power of the sea salt and delivering it directly into your bathroom.</li>

Skinjay n'est pas seulement facile à utiliser, plus simple et plus rapide à appliquer: <strong>c'est LA solution la plus efficace pour prendre soin de votre peau </strong>!

<h2><strong>Mais qu'est ce que le Mixer Skinjay?</strong></h2>
<p>Le Mixer Skinjay est un dispositif à la fois astucieux et luxueux qui se connecte en quelques secondes à votre pommeau ou à votre flexible de douche.

<p>Le Mixer Skinjay est un dispositif mécanique fait de matériaux de qualité. Il a été conçu pour accueillir n'importe quelle capsule Skinjay en l'insérant simplement dans la fente prévue à cet effet comme présenté ci-dessous.

<p> </p></div>","They're talking about us / Ils parlent de nous
     A short introduction
I am Nicolas Pasquier, a 39 years old french entrepreneur with extensive experience in the IT and luxury industries. About a year ago I got an idea that was so crazy I had to follow it. So I founded Skinjay, a company located 20 minutes from Paris and at the north end of the Cosmetic Valley. As weeks turned into months, the idea turned into a concept then prototypes and finally into the patented products (patents pending) and technology you are about to discover thanks to the help and dedication of a very talented team.
Now we are looking for backers to join our team and help us build the future of Skinjay Paris. Back us up and you will become an active member of the Skinjay team and part of an entrepreneurial adventure.
Time is a luxury. Take time for yourself.
Because we live in a fast paced environment where it is harder everyday to find time for one self, Skinjay created an innovative product that brings pleasure to your shower!
No phone, No tablet, No kids. Just you, water and a little bit of magic in the shape of a small capsule and a patented innovative device that deliver wellness and organic skin care products directly into your water stream.

Natural skin care & wellness in a capsule
Skinjay is putting nature in a luxury capsule that delivers pure organic skin care and wellness products into your shower. For up to 8 minutes, the skinjay capsule mixes essential oils, organic skin care and natural fragrances with your water stream so that you can choose which skin or body care product is best for you today.
CAPSULES AVAILABLE IN OCTOBER 1.5€ to 2.5€ each (2$/3$)

How Skinjay delivers wellness into your shower
Skinjay presents the world's first shower capsule Mixer that turns your bathroom into your own private SPA. Connect once this luxury device to your shower head or shower hose, then simply choose a Skinjay capsule and insert it into the Mixer. For the next 4 to 8 minutes, enjoy the soothing power of the best quality organic skin care and fragrances being delivered directly into your water stream and onto your skin. Change capsule and discover a new experience everytime!

Take care of yourself and nature
We believe that you can do great things and still respect our ecosystem. That is why both Skinjay capsules and their content are made of natural products that are respectful of your skin and of nature:

The capsules’ body is made of hypoallergenic biodegradable material that respects European Union norm EN13432 for compostability.
The capsules content is made solely of organic ingredients selected for their excellent soothing and caring qualities.
The capsules biological content are produced by one of the leading organic skin care manufacturer in France.
Skinjay drives for the highest standards in skin care products quality so you can experience the safest and most relaxing way to shower. Just let warm water and soothing natural products enveloppe your entire body creating a new kind of shower experience... every time.

In-shower natural skin care
We are looking to preserve nature not to improve it. And we don't need to: skin pores do open up naturally under warm water. We simply take advantage of this fact to deliver high quality skin care, essential oils and moisturizers with the best possible effectiveness. Skinjay is not only easy to use, easier and faster to apply, it is actually the most effective solution for your skin. All you have to do is choose the capsule that's best for you today. And there are many many many different ones coming which you will be able to choose from.

Stay at home and treat yourself to a SPA
Skinjay's goal is not only to leave you with great skin but also with a feeling of peace and harmony. That is why we will create several capsule collections to  both care for and relax your skin, your body and your mind. With capsules focused on relaxation we will provide you with an easy way to cool down after a hard day at work, recover after your daily run or even get lucky with our upcoming naughty caps!
For our Indiegogo launch we are offering you SPA and essential oils capsules available in our Mixer & mix packs.

So what is the Skinjay Mixer ?
The Skinjay Mixer is a small sleek innovative device that easily connects in seconds to your shower hose or to your shower head. It allows you to easily insert a capsule and release organic skin care, fragrance or relaxing products directly into the water stream of your shower or your bath.
How does it work ?
The Mixer is a mechanical device made of high quality materials. It is designed to welcome any Skinjay capsule by simply sliding it into position as shown below. Once the capsule is inserted, a gentle 180° turn of the patented one-action wheel of the Mixer will release organic skin care  into your shower for the next 4 to 8 minutes giving you the pleasure to hydrate under the shower, relax with essential oils or even enjoy the soothing care of algotherapy.

Functional design with style
The simplicity of the Skinjay Mixer and the fact that it requires only two moves to be operational is no accident but the result of over a year of research and design. We still tried to create the most beautiful product possible and we are actually very proud of its design . The back plate will be manufactured in high-end chrome or inox but the front parts can be styled to create original designs which will  integrate perfectly within any bathroom. For our Indiegogo launch, you can choose between four different styles including the gorgeous Indiegogo limited edition.

Why we need you ?
We are currently at our 4th revision prototype of the Mixer and after demonstrating it and the capsules to hundreds of people over the last several months, we finally feel that the products are ready to enter into the next stage of production. We've determined that we can achieve the right price point if we commit to build a production scale of units. That's where we need your help.
Also, your feedback will be the (second) most important part of this Indiegogo challenge as it will direct our interest towards one of the many possible capsules collections including but not limited to:


Balneotherapy capsules: harnessing the known healing power of the sea salt and delivering it directly into your bathroom.

Algotherapy capsules: did you know that algae such as wrack, kelp and sea lettuce fresh contain phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, vitamins, plant hormone against aging, chlorophyll which is an antiseptic and detoxifying agent... ?

SPA capsules: for those of you equiped with state-of-the-art 43 nozzles rotating shower heads ;-) we will deliver tonic or relaxing ingredients in your SPA ‘à la maison’.

Kids capsules: because a pink bubble gum smelling shower or bath is so much FUN !
So get your own Skinjay mixer and capsule mix today and let us know what you want next!

Meet the team
The company was founded in 2012 by Nicolas Pasquier in order to create innovative eco-friendly products for the general public. Four partners soon joined in and have invested both their time and their money to create a product that will deliver a unique shower and bathing experience. The talented designer Loic Dubos joined and brought his design genius to the mix. The team members total way over 50 years of experience starting and developing companies, engineering and marketing products in Europe, Russia and North America.

What’s next ?
Here's a short roadmap outlining the production plans for the next few months after Indiegogo funding. As far as bio skin care products are concerned we have been working with manufacturers of french organic cosmetics and we will be finalizing our partnership within the next few weeks.

 



 
 
Une courte présentation
Je m'appelle Nicolas Pasquier, je suis un entrepreneur français de 39 ans avec une expérience dans les industries des nouvelles technologies et du luxe. Il y  a un peu plus d'un an, j'ai eu une idée si folle que j'ai décidé de la réaliser. J'ai donc créé Skinjay, une entreprise située à 20 minutes de Paris et à l'extrémité nord de la cosmetic valley. Alors que les semaines devenaient des mois, cette idée s'est transformée en prototypes pour enfin devenir la technologie et les produits que vous allez découvrir, notamment grâce à une équipe pleine de talent.
Maintenant nous sommes à la recherche de personnes souhaitant prendre part à cette aventure entrepreneuriale. Soutenez-vous et devenez un membre actif de l'équipe Skinjay!

Le temps est un luxe. Prenez du temps pour vous.
Nous vivons dans un monde en perpétuel mouvement dans lequel il est difficile de trouver du temps pour prendre soin de soi. Skinjay a donc conçu un produit unique qui diffuse du plaisir dans votre douche.
Pas de téléphone. Pas de tablette. Pas d'enfants. Juste vous, de l'eau et un petit peu de magie sous la forme d'une petite capsule et d'un dispositif breveté et innovant qui vont diffuser du bien être et des produits de soin pour la peau directement dans l'eau de votre douche.

Bien être et soins bio pour la peau dans une capsule
Skinjay met la nature dans une capsule luxueuse qui diffuse dans votre douche des soins naturels pour la peau et pour le bien être. Pendant un maximum de 8 minutes, la capsule mélange à votre flux d'eau des huiles essentielles pures, des soins bio pour la peau et des parfums naturels. Vous pouvez ainsi librement choisir quel soin est le plus approprié à votre peau aujourd'hui.
CAPSULES DISPONIBLES EN OCTOBRE DE 1.5€ A 2.5€ (2$ A 3$)

Skinjay diffuse du bien être dans votre douche
Skinjay présente le premier Mixer pour capsules de douche qui transforme vote salle de bain en SPA privé. Connectez le une bonne fois pour toute à votre pommeau ou à votre flexible de douche, choisissez une capsule et insérez là dans le dispositif. Pour les 4 à 8 minutes suivantes, découvrez les bienfaits de produits de soins bio pour la peau et des parfums diffusés directement dans le flux d'eau chaude de votre douche et sur votre peau.

<p><strong>The What:</strong> Online, Completely Donation-Based, Yoga and Meditation Studio.  We want to help make yoga and meditation accessible to EVERY BODY.  Download or stream ANY class/session/tip you want … if you find value in our little business, then donate what you think is fair and respectable.  </p>
<p>Our Future Site (still under construction and in testing phase): <strong>enterzenhere.com</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Who:</strong> Who is EZ Yoga = Rodger and Anita, husband and wife, she teaches yoga and does the graphic design...he does the technical, videography and web stuff.  For the past year and a half we have worked hard on this passion project in our spare time and spent over ten thousand dollars of our own money to get it out to you – we know there is a huge risk our little business idea won't make a dime.  But, what if, why not, donation-based businesses and products?! A new way of doing business that levels the financial playing field to  allow everyone access to a product.</p>

<p>I created my book in order to address a widespread misunderstanding about the nature and value of Pilates.  Among the general public, Pilates is mainly seen as a method of exercise aimed at fitness. But those who really know Pilates realize that it is much more than exercise -- it is a path to comprehensive health in body, mind and spirit. In short, Pilates is meant to be transformative. It is my understanding and  others (<a href=""http://www.pilatespathtohealth.com/book-endorsements"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">endorser's</a>) that this was clearly Joseph Pilates’ intent; and it is the focus of my work and the message of my book. I want to share this understanding of Pilates as broadly as possible.</p>
<p>I’m raising money to finance a new printing of the book, so that it can reach more readers who might benefit from its message. Again, I feel this reflects Joe’s intent. He desired, and even predicted, that the deep, transformative character of Pilates would one day be understood by men and women, young and old, rich and poor, teacher, student and client alike, worldwide. Joe meant to change the world; and so do I.</p>
<p><strong>The Timing is Perfect</strong></p>
<p>Filmmaker Mark Pedri will release his new film about Pilates, “<a href=""http://www.movementofmovement.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>A Movement of Movement</a>,” in 2014. This film, in my view, is a perfect companion to my book -- the film and book share a similar understanding of Pilates. Mark Pedri did me the honor of including me in his film. He also offered the following comment after reading my book: </p>
<p><em>“I am so glad that you gave it to me to read. Your connection between Pilates and reaching one's potential is so important. The way you kept tying it back to ""Return to Life"" was brilliant. Your book is a great read not just for the someone in the Pilates community, but also for anyone who is interested in reaching their full potential!""</em></p>
<p>I anticipate that Mark’s film will be shown widely during 2014 and beyond, both at dedicated Pilates events (trainings, symposia) and in more general venues. From this, I believe many viewers could be inspired to seek out my book. Therefore, it’s important to have lots of copies available for distribution by the time the film comes out. I’m seeking your help to finance a larger printing of the book so that it can reach its intended audience now, while the timing is right.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need, and What It’s For</strong></p>
<p>I need to raise $5,500 to finance a new print run of my book by December 11th, 2013. </p>
<p>The book has been widely praised and received <a href=""http://pilates.about.com/od/pilatesequipment/ss/2012-Readers-Choice-Awards-For-Best-In-Pilates_5.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">About.com’s Readers’ Choice Award</a> in 2012 for the best new book about Pilates. Renowned Pilates teacher <a href=""http://www.pilatescenterofaustin.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wendy Leblanc-Arbuckle</a>, who wrote the book’s Foreword, captures the book’s unique value when she says:</p>
<p><em>""With the explosive growth of Pilates, we are in danger of losing the soul of Joseph Pilates vision. Gary Calderone's work carries a message whose time has come. He dives us deep into the heart of Joe's work, placing it at dead center in the resurgence of mind/body perspective...and shines a bright and clear light on the transformational pathway that it provides for realizing our fullest potential, physically, emotionally and spiritually.""</em></p>
<p>Now, I want to print a much larger number of books in anticipation of increasing demand in the year ahead. The “explosive growth” of Pilates continues worldwide, and with it comes the constant need to emphasize Pilates’ true purpose, as Joe himself understood it then (1883-1967) and now translated for the 21st century. That is my mission, and the essence of my book. In order to advance this mission, I’m obliged to come up with the cash to finance that next big printing -- hence this fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>I’m asking everyone who cares about Pilates and the potential for human transformation in body, mind and spirit to join me in making sure my book is available to the ever-growing audience of people who are just discovering Pilates for themselves. I want my book to be featured in Pilates studios and training centers everywhere. I want it in libraries and bookstores. With your help, all this can happen.</p>
<p>When you really believe in something, you give to it. I want to be a part of something larger than the space I occupy. I've invested over ten years of my life in this effort and am determined to see this message realized. Please, join me.</p>

<p><b><i>I recognize that not everyone is in a position to donate</i></b> or that you might prefer to donate to folks in more desperate positions. I understand and respect that choice. I don't have money to give away, either, and I know that others need funds more than I do.</p>
<p><b><i>If you make the choice to support me, please share this fundraiser far and wide. </i></b>Share it on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, even Google+. E-mail your friends. If each one of my Twitter followers raised $4 in one day of donations, I'd have enough money for the surgery TOMORROW. The further this spreads, the faster it gets funded.</p>

<h3><b>Details and Disclosures</b></h3>
<p>Transparency and honesty are the core principles of this fundraising campaign. I attend Emory University and I'm covered under our student health insurance plan. Thanks to remarkable transgender advocacy on campus, my health insurance plan covers both psychological counselling and hormone replacement therapy. The plan also covers a percentage of transgender surgeries depending on whether the surgeon is in network or out of network. </p>
<h4><b><u>Timing</u></b></h4>
<p>My procedure is on <b>April 23rd, 2014.</b> After the first of the year, my surgeon will begin pre-authorizing the procedure with my insurance provider and it would be comforting to have the money on hand at that point. I'm raising the money early so that I can relax, be prepared and so that I can make arrangements that fall within my budget. More importantly, if I fail to raise the money this fall, I'll need extra time to take out loans and credit cards to cover all of my costs.</p>
<h4><b><u>Cost of the Procedure</u></b></h4>
<p>In the case of my surgeon, the plan should cover 80% of a procedure quoted to me at $20,000: <b>$4,000</b>. However, the only student to go through sex reassignment surgery under this health insurance plan was then charged another $4,000 in hospital and other fees: <b>$8,000. That's what I've set as the main goal.</b></p>
<h4><b><u>Extra Costs</u></b></h4>
<p>This is nowhere near the total cost of this endeavor. There may be other medical costs associated with the procedure: hair removal on the genitals, precautionary tests or procedures for my heart condition, what-have-you. I will also have to travel to the location of the surgery (thousands of miles away) and I will have to find lodging for my convalescence. I won't be able to work for about a month.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4><b><u>What Happens to Extra Money?</u></b></h4>
<p><b>I've set the stretch goal for the game at $15,000</b> because I'm confident that will be enough to cover all of my costs and leave me with enough leftover to pay Cameron, Brigid and an artist.</p>

</div></div>","I've scheduled my surgery for April 23rd, 2014 and I need your help to pay for it.

I can't even begin to explain what this would mean to me or to my partner. For me, this would be the physical endpoint of a difficult and complicated journey. Logistically, I'd be able to change all of my government documentation to F which would allow me to not be outed to employers and physicians. But I would also be able to look how I want to look and have the kind of sex I want to have. I just want to know what it's like to love my body for one day and I'll be happy. Please help me get to that day.

What can you do?

If you're in a position to donate, please donate. 
I've tried to assemble a variety of interesting perks and stretch goals (see below) to encourage your generosity. You will receive my undying gratitude and you will be a part of changing someone's life in an incredibly meaningful way.
This is the one and only time in my life that I will ever ask for money. If you want to support me or say thanks for something I've done, this is your chance.
I recognize that not everyone is in a position to donate or that you might prefer to donate to folks in more desperate positions. I understand and respect that choice. I don't have money to give away, either, and I know that others need funds more than I do.
If you make the choice to support me, please share this fundraiser far and wide. Share it on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, even Google+. E-mail your friends. If each one of my Twitter followers raised $4 in one day of donations, I'd have enough money for the surgery TOMORROW. The further this spreads, the faster it gets funded.

What am I giving back? A GAME and more!
SUPER VAGINA TIME
In addition to several perks (at the side), this fundraising campaign has one major stretch goal. If it reaches $15,000 (an amount which will comfortably cover my procedure as well as associated travel and lodging costs -- see details below), I will commission game designer Cameron Kunzelman (Catachresis and Alpaca Run) to make 
a twitch-arcade vagina dilation game about vaginoplasty aftercare. 
If you enjoyed Super Hexagon, you'll like this game a lot. 
I will also commission my friend Brigid Choi to compose and record a riot grrrl soundtrack for this game. I'll also commission someone to help Cameron with the vagina art. THIS WILL BE AS AMAZING AS IT SOUNDS. It is tentatively titled: SUPER VAGINA TIME. The game will be released by January 15th, 2014.
A screenshot from Alpaca Run:



Possible Donation to the Sylvia Rivera Law Project
When the surgery is over and all the associated bills have been paid (including the wages of my game creators), 
I will donate any and all leftover money to the Sylvia Rivera Law Project.
SLRP is a legal aid organization that advocates for ""low-income people of color who are transgender, intersex, or gender non-conforming."" SLRP is a tremendous organization that helps people who are far less privileged than myself. 
Feel free to donate well beyond the stretch goal. If I reach the goal, I'll be publicizing the IndieGoGo as a way to raise money for SRLP, using the flashiness of our cool Super Vagina Time game to get the Internet interested in helping out low-income trans* folks.
Details and Disclosures
Transparency and honesty are the core principles of this fundraising campaign. I attend Emory University and I'm covered under our student health insurance plan. Thanks to remarkable transgender advocacy on campus, my health insurance plan covers both psychological counselling and hormone replacement therapy. The plan also covers a percentage of transgender surgeries depending on whether the surgeon is in network or out of network.

My procedure is on April 23rd, 2014. After the first of the year, my surgeon will begin pre-authorizing the procedure with my insurance provider and it would be comforting to have the money on hand at that point.

She'd be able to hold my hand before I went under and she'd be smiling at me when I woke up.
All this is to say that if the proceeds of this campaign exceed $8,000, the money will be put to good use and will not be used for any raucous parties. Overall, this whole trip will cost somewhere in the ballpark of $12,000-$14,000.


What Happens to Extra Money?
I've set the stretch goal for the game at $15,000 because I'm confident that will be enough to cover all of my costs and leave me with enough leftover to pay Cameron, Brigid and an artist.

                    designed to be fun, supportive and challenging, while burning maximum fat, in minimum time.
                    Personalization is key to getting the best possible results, which is why our workout programs are
                    modified to fit your goals and individual fitness level.
Unlike working one-on-one with a personal trainer, our workout programs are done in a group
                    setting which makes them fun, motivating, challenging while keeping the cost of the program
                    affordable compared to private one-on-one personal training sessions.What We Need Upper Cape Fit Body requires $20,000 in order to successfully launch.  The entirety of this funding will go towards licensing, facility build-out and equipment.  Our 3000 sq foot facility will use funds for typical building improvements such as paint, signage, in additional to installing carpet backed foam flooring.  The equipment needed initially includes Dumbbells, TRX Suspension Training Centers, Battle Ropes and Pull Up Stations.  In return for your support, we’re offering up some great rewards!

<p>How can you say no to a fluffy white donut covered in powdered sugar? As it turns out, calories aren’t the only thing that you should be worried about. Our recent lab tests<strong> found potentially harmful nano-sized particles in the white powdered sugar on Dunkin’ Donuts</strong>.</p>
<p>Nanoparticles are one millionth the size of a grain of sand. Because of their small size, they are able to go places in the body that regular particles cannot. When eaten, nano can pass into the blood and travel to vital organs including the liver, the heart, and even the brain. A recent scientific study showed that ingested nano caused abnormal swelling in the brains of rats.</p>
<p>So how do we know if these additives are in your food?  Well, if it’s up to food manufactures, you won’t! </p>
<p>That’s why we decided to take matters into our own hands by finding where nano is entering our food supply. <strong>We need your help to raise $9,000 to test three products we believe may contain nano: Pop-Tarts, M&amp;M’s, and Betty Crocker frosting.</strong> All three may use colorings, just like in the white powdered sugar on Dunkin’ Donuts that contain nano.</p>

<h3><strong>About HomeTouch</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.myhometouch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HomeTouch</a> is an award winning software-as-a-service that enables families and care providers to manage the care of older people in their own homes. HomeTouch’s vision is to develop a globally accessible service that intervenes following a decline in functioning, prolongs independence at home and continues to offer support during higher levels of dependence towards the end of life.</p>
<p>HomeTouch’s vision is twofold: firstly, to enable older people to become less isolated, more active and less dependent, and secondly to provide families/care providers with a set of productivity, monitoring and communication tools to support care anytime/anywhere.</p>
<h3>Our Founder</h3>
<p>Dr Jamie Wilson is a physician and dementia specialist and worked for 10 years in the UK NHS. He founded HomeTouch to help families care better for isolated older relatives because he saw the lack of solutions to help families care for loved ones with early dementia.. HomeTouch was initially trialled at a memory clinic at Imperial College London. Jamie has an MBA from London Business School/UC Berkeley, a medical degree from Leeds University Medical School, and membership of Royal College of Psychiatrists. He has worked at leading healthcare organizations from the BMJ to Novartis and is also an experienced technology entrepreneur with a previous startup in Silicion Valley.</p>
<h3>Our Investors and Customers</h3>

HomeTouch is an award winning software-as-a-service that enables families and care providers to manage the care of older people in their own homes. HomeTouch’s vision is to develop a globally accessible service that intervenes following a decline in functioning, prolongs independence at home and continues to offer support during higher levels of dependence towards the end of life.
HomeTouch’s vision is twofold: firstly, to enable older people to become less isolated, more active and less dependent, and secondly to provide families/care providers with a set of productivity, monitoring and communication tools to support care anytime/anywhere.
Our Founder
Dr Jamie Wilson is a physician and dementia specialist and worked for 10 years in the UK NHS. He founded HomeTouch to help families care better for isolated older relatives because he saw the lack of solutions to help families care for loved ones with early dementia.. HomeTouch was initially trialled at a memory clinic at Imperial College London. Jamie has an MBA from London Business School/UC Berkeley, a medical degree from Leeds University Medical School, and membership of Royal College of Psychiatrists. He has worked at leading healthcare organizations from the BMJ to Novartis and is also an experienced technology entrepreneur with a previous startup in Silicion Valley.

<p>Just wanted to let everyone know that the instructions on how to build the DIY CineDrone are done and you should have gotten an email on where and how to get it. If you didn't then please contact me ASAP. For those of you who ordere the custom made CineDrones, just wanted to let you know that all I have to do is test out each CineDrones and if all is working I can send it to you. Unfortunately do to my crazy schedule I might not be able to test out all of the CineDrone and ship them out this week. After November 1st I am gone to Ecuador and won't be able to ship out the CineDrone until I come back to the USA on November 16th. I am now emailing everyone who ordered the CineDrone in the order that the pledges were made. If I get the payment for the shipping before November 1st then I will mail it out to you this week. If I don't then I will send it out after November 16th. Sorry guys, I know it's all delayed but I completely underestimated how much work building these will be. So I am trying to be as fair and fast by shipping the CineDrones out in the same order that each pledge was made.<br/></p>
<p><strong>Update #3 - September 7, 2013</strong></p>
<p>I am done filming the tutorials, and editing them. The first tutorials will be out later this week. As for the custom built CineDrones, I'm still working on those.

<p><strong>Sky Is The Limit - the CineDrone</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to advances in technology, indie filmmakers now have amazing tools that let them match the picture quality of Hollywood productions. However, one important aspect of filmmaking that has remained out of the reach of low-budget filmmakers is aerial cinematography. This does not have to be the case much longer, though. </p>
<p>As soon as the first consumer quadcopters emerged, inventive filmmakers started to experiment with recording video footage from these devices. The results have been mixed. Even when the footage turned out to be satisfactory, usually the time, cost and technical expertise required to build such a system was considerable, thereby still keeping aerial cinematography out the toolbox of most filmmakers.</p>
<p>For the last year I have been testing different devices and components to see whether it is possible to build a system on a reasonable budget that would meet the needs of indie filmmakers. I am happy to say that I have constructed a system - i.e. the  <em><strong>CineDrone</strong></em> - that meets my needs as a filmmaker and cinematographer. Watch my test footage and judge the results for yourself. Considering that I have not used any post-stabilization, I think that CineDrone is capable of producing great shots that would fit perfectly in a mega budget film production.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where do you come in?</strong></p>
<p>I have spent a lot of time and money to build this one device. With this experience, I can now make improvements to the build of this system. I can also lower the costs if I can order all the components in batches.</p>
<p>Therefore, If there are enough of you interested, I can gain the scale and efficiency to deliver the <em><strong>CineDrones</strong></em> on an affordable budget.</p>
<p>I am foremost a filmmaker and so I am not planning to get in the business of selling these systems afterwards. But with your pledges I could dedicate the time to build a limited number of these devices so that more filmmakers can start getting great aerial shots.   </p>
<p>Here are some key advantages of my <em><strong>CineDrone</strong></em>:</p>
<p>- great aerial cinematography on an affordable budget</p>
<p>- a small device that only requires one person to operate it</p>
<p>- can be used in spaces where airplanes cannot or are not allowed to fly</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What you get?</strong><br/><br/>I have various rewards. The key is the <em><strong>CineDrone</strong></em> itself. If you don't know how or simply don't have the time to build one yourself then I can do it for you. This way all you have to do is attach your GoPro Hero 3 camera and you're ready to fly. If you want to build one yourself then I will produce video tutorials that explain how to make the exact same <em><strong>CineDrone</strong></em> like the one I have. Also, I will produce for you a series of training videos on how to get cinematic shots using an RC aerial platform like my <strong><em>CineDrone</em></strong>.</p>

Then in one moment, he snapped and bucked me off. The resulting bruise spread from knee to ribcage.</h3>

<h3>WE CAN NOT CLAIM THAT KTBOOM DIAGNOSES, PREVENTS OR CURES ANY DISEASE.</h3>

<br/><strong>What we can claim is that after years of trials, we found a blend of organic essential oils in a base of organic alcohol, safely and effectively discourages from landing all of those arthropods which carry and transmit Malaria, Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), West Nile Virus (WNV), Dengue Fever and painful bites and stings. This includes mosquitos, ticks, fleas, biting flies, bot flies, deer flies, horse flies, biting gnats, spiders, ants and bed bugs. </strong>

<p><b>Here is a testimonial from Becky Duncan, my riding instructor and a long time equestrian: ""Our barn is surrounded on three sides by parkland.

<h3><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">This campaign will not start out with a slick video or advertising campaign. I'm already pretty much invested in the development. If funded, this money will be used to produce a first run of $1500 (both 2 and 4 oz) atomizers of KTBOOM by a company in Boca Raton FL that has received it's organic certification. They will produce it and bottle it in aluminum atomizers (so far, they seem the best vessel). NO AEROSOLS!</strong></h3>
<h3><strong> <br/>The first-run costs will be approximately $4000.  There is an additional $1000 for waterproof labeling.  The rest of the money will be used to develop the most efficient and animal/earth friendly way of producing the large 28oz spray bottle that will use a plant-based surfactant to enable the product to spray a foam.  The foam bottle will be intended for protecting larger surfaces:  like your horse or fidgety dogs.  It will still be people friendly, but more effective than an atomizer for applications to larger surfaces.  The cost is variable.  We are in negotiations on development costs and have yet to develop a prototype. Soaps, shampoos and cosmetic friendly products to work in tandem follow.</strong></h3>

 The first-run costs will be approximately $4000.  There is an additional $1000 for waterproof labeling.  The rest of the money will be used to develop the most efficient and animal/earth friendly way of producing the large 28oz spray bottle that will use a plant-based surfactant to enable the product to spray a foam.  The foam bottle will be intended for protecting larger surfaces:  like your horse or fidgety dogs.  It will still be people friendly, but more effective than an atomizer for applications to larger surfaces.  The cost is variable.  We are in negotiations on development costs and have yet to develop a prototype. Soaps, shampoos and cosmetic friendly products to work in tandem follow.
Finished product retail will range from $11 (2oz), $19 (4oz) and the foam $29-32 (28oz).
We will promote the product through social media (facebook, a reasonably slick website [I want to make a video similar to the 70's commercial where someone sprays Deet on their arm and sticks it into a misquito filled glass tank and the bugs flee. I will use MY arm]). Plus, affiliations with anxious equestrians in Potamac MD, and people who do not yet know that they want it in mosquito infested Ocala FL, will enable us to put it in front of appreciative people.
Let us be honest with ourselves, if the Earth is warming, then this type of vector will only become a greater threat.
Initially, this will not be profitable. It will be laborious. When it does become a viable enterprise, we commit 10% of all profits from the sale of these products to the distribution of KTBOOM to regions, domestic and foreign, where it will provide needed relief. 
Yes, mosquito netting saves many lives, but you cannot spend your day walking around in it. And Deet has saved hundreds of millions of lives. At what environmental and health cost?
We will have to get a patent immediately. No, I don't have a patent. I have a chocolate company to run. Maybe a patent attorney would like to take this up as a cause celebre. If people show interest, we will set to it.
The perks:
The knowledge you helped save people (and yourself) and animals you love from painful bites and possibly fatal diseases.
Not enough?
OK. No matter whether we get funded or not, if you commit the $, we'll get you the perk. I'll make the product myself, package and send it.
The FUNDER of $1000 gets a good amount for human and friend, plus we will send a case in their name to wherever they choose. This is for the folks who have a platform, and liquidity: Woody Harrelson, Angelina Jolie, Sheryl Crow, Madonna, Sean Penn, George Clooney, John Lyons...
They are able to fund our work, and we support theirs.

<p><b>Introducing Athelix: The Athletic
Elixir for Athletes*</b></p>
<p> *<i>Any individual dedicated
to his or her sport.</i></p>
<p><b>Why Athelix?</b></p>
<p>You're most likely thinking, why
should I bother funding this project? There are plenty products I could get at
a local supplement store that can help me achieve my desired goals. What makes
this so different from the others?</p>
<p>Athelix addresses this question. The
supplement industry is unregulated. Many of the most popular products have
active ingredients, but are mixed with fillers to cheapen the production. Don't
believe me? Check the label and look for the words ""proprietary
blend"". With a proprietary blend they do not disclose how much of the
active ingredient is actually in the product. This was initially meant to
protect the manufacturing formula, but now many use it as a way to short the
consumers.</p>
<p>Our mission at Athelix is to provide
a quality product of the highest standards. Each consumer is different, but his
or her energy systems are not. Athelix creates its products to support the body’s
energy system, while following the rules of the US Anti-Doping agency. We
formulate our products based on the guidelines of theNational
Strength and Conditioning Association. These guidelines explain how much, why,
and what each active ingredient does for the body.</p>
<p><b>What differentiates Athelix?</b></p>
<p>Our product is specifically tailored
to work with the body’s energy systems. This gives athletes a way to customize
their supplement intake based on how they train and their personal goals. </p>
<p>The body has three basic energy
systems that are utilized during exercise; oxidative, glycolytic, and
phosphagen. The duration and intensity of individual exercises dictate which of
the three energy systems the body uses, this varies from sport to sport..</p>

formulate our products based on the guidelines of theNational
Strength and Conditioning Association. These guidelines explain how much, why,
and what each active ingredient does for the body.
What differentiates Athelix?
Our product is specifically tailored
to work with the body’s energy systems. This gives athletes a way to customize
their supplement intake based on how they train and their personal goals. 
The body has three basic energy
systems that are utilized during exercise; oxidative, glycolytic, and
phosphagen. The duration and intensity of individual exercises dictate which of
the three energy systems the body uses, this varies from sport to sport..

*The Container Pictured Is Only a
Prototype. The real one shall be in a much bigger container; in a 3000cc
white hdpe wide mouth jar, 110mm white ribbed self-venting hso cap, 50cc clear
medium handle flat bottom scoop, celon neck band and 12pk.

What's in it? 
After the first days of test
production it became obvious that most products were skimping the public. We do
not produce our products unless they match the exact quantity of active
ingredients chosen during the test phase. Our products only combine active
ingredients with natural sweeteners and natural flavors to ensure quality over
quantity. 
In order to create products that
support different energy systems the ingredients have to be tested and proven
by an organization of the highest standards. Athelix follows the guidelines and
research done by the National Strength and Conditioning Association. 
It is safe and has been proven to
help athletes compete at the highest level.
Some sports that can benefit from
Cross are: 
Crossfit, Soccer, Boxing,
Basketball, Football, Rugby, Mid Distance Track and Field, Mixed Martial Arts,

</h3> <p>My name is Summer, and in 2002, I weighed 271 lbs. I lost over half of my body weight in about a year and a half and have kept it off ever since.</p>
<p>Over the years I have worked to assist others with motivation and advice to help them achieve their weight loss and fitness goals. I ran a blog on the topic from 2011-2012, I am active on Fitocracy and other health/fitness-oriented sites, and I've started a YouTube channel to further help crowd out all of the bad information that exists and prevents people from succeeding.</p>
<p>As I look to continue these efforts, I struggle with one huge remnant from my past: a large amount of excess skin. It's a psychological barrier that occasionally causes me a lot of stress and difficulty with staying on a healthy path.</p>
<p>To understand more about my motivations, please read <a href=""https://medium.com/@summerlorenzsonn/stop-telling-me-i-have-a-bikini-body-80f91c3f51e7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stop Telling Me I Have a Bikini Body.""</a><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get<br/>
</h3> <p>At this time, I have a job that will allow me to work from home during the recovery phase, which in the past has prevented me from moving forward. However, I only have enough money (including loans) to fund about 2/3 of the surgery costs.</p>
<p>What I have to give back in exchange for your support are two things: information and entertainment. I'd love to make videos to answer any of your questions on the topics of health, weight loss, and fitness. But I know not everyone is interested in those things, so I'm also happy to be your dancing YouTube puppet.</p>

AmaMax Rush is proven to offer significant advantages in reducing muscle
damage, speeding muscle recovery, enhancing endurance, and boosting healthy immune
function. All of these exercise performance benefits from consuming
carbohydrates and proteins together are backed by numerous research
studies.<br/><br/><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-weight: bold;""><b style="""">Effects of Recovery
Beverages on Glycogen Restoration and Endurance Exercise Performance</b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In this study eight endurance-trained cyclists were each
given high carbohydrate-protein (CHO-PRO) beverages and traditional
all-carbohydrate (AC) beverages immediately and two hours after two two-hour trial
rides. Ingestion of the CHO-PRO beverage resulted in a 17% greater plasma
glucose response, a 92% greater insulin response, and a 128% greater storage of
muscle glycogen compared to the AC beverage. These findings demonstrate that
the rate of recovery is coupled with the rate of muscle glycogen replenishment
and suggest that CHO-PRO recovery supplements should be consumed to optimize
muscle recovery.</p>

Hormonal Response, and Muscle Damage</b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The study used 34 male subjects to determine whether
resistance exercise performance and post-exercise muscle damage were altered
when consuming a carbohydrate and protein beverage. Each subject performed
three sets of eight repetitions at their eight repetition maximum to fatigue
for multiple exercises. The results demonstrated that the CHO-PRO supplement reduced
muscle damage and soreness, as evidenced by the elevated response levels of
both myoglobin and creatine kinase.</p>

<b>The Simple Truth About Sugars.

</b><br/><br/>The simple sugars used in AmaMax Rush are essential for the post exercise meal. Simple sugars help in two major ways:

<br/><br/>1.	They assist in inhibiting cortisol (an insulin blocker) by creating a large insulin rise.
<br/>2.	They also assist in replenishing glycogen within the liver and muscle. 

<br/><br/>Both the rise in insulin and replenishment of glycogen are a result of eating high-Glycemic Index (GI) foods, a necessity for achieving optimal recovery immediately following exercise. 

However it is important to understand that not all sugars are equal and some are better than others. While Fructose is one of the worst at creating a high insulin rise with a GI of just 29, Glucose is the best with a GI of 99. AmaMax Rush contains pure Glucose plus other simple sugars to ensure your recovery is maximised.<br/><br/><b>100% Made in Australia.

</b><br/><br/>When Bennett Maxwell mixed up the first batches of AmaMax Rush in his kitchen, he used a Cuisinart mixer. Things have come a long way since then and now every package of Rush will be made in world-class facilities, right here in Melbourne, Australia. 

<br/><br/>Our facility adheres to the most stringent quality standards, so you can rest assured that each Rush pack is made exactly like it is intended. Mass production of Rush will be monitored for safety and quality by checking each and every batch.

Formulated with an optimal 3.5:1 ratio of high quality carbohydrates and proteins derived from the Amaranth super grain, pure whey protein isolates and other natural ingredients.
Tastes great – just like a chocolate mousse dessert. We tested over 3,000 sample packs of AmaMax Rush with people from around the globe to get the taste just right.
Free of gluten, soy, nuts, and trans fats.
We're sponsoring three up-and-coming athletes with full-year supplies of AmaMax Rush. 

AmaMax Rush is a delicious recovery food that combines the latest in nutritional research with the super grain Amaranth and other natural ingredients to reduce recovery time following exercise. 


The truth is many of us don’t get a combination of both proteins and carbohydrates before, during, and after exercises, when this is exactly what we need to perform at our best. 
AmaMax Rush delivers just that. It’s the culmination of five years of the latest in nutritional research and testing to provide the most functional sports recovery food on the planet. And at the heart of it all are its ingredients. Made using natural gluten-free ingredients and the super grain Amaranth, AmaMax Rush fuels you with the nutrients you need to perform at your peak, recover faster and live healthier. 
The Science. 
We developed Rush with a scientifically-proven 3.5:1 ratio of high-quality carbohydrates and proteins derived from the Amaranth grain and other natural ingredients, to deliver an array of recovery and health benefits.
The following chart shows the main differences between proteins (PRO) alone or carbohydrates (CHO) alone versus a combination of proteins and carbohydrates found in AmaMax Rush:



Ivy, J., Portman, R. (2004), ‘Nutrient Timing: The Future of
Sports Nutrition’, Basic Health
Publications Inc., table 5.1, pp. 64. 

Unlike other leading energy bars, gels and sports drinks,
AmaMax Rush is proven to offer significant advantages in reducing muscle
damage, speeding muscle recovery, enhancing endurance, and boosting healthy immune
function. All of these exercise performance benefits from consuming
carbohydrates and proteins together are backed by numerous research
studies.Effects of Recovery
Beverages on Glycogen Restoration and Endurance Exercise Performance
In this study eight endurance-trained cyclists were each
given high carbohydrate-protein (CHO-PRO) beverages and traditional
all-carbohydrate (AC) beverages immediately and two hours after two two-hour trial
rides. Ingestion of the CHO-PRO beverage resulted in a 17% greater plasma
glucose response, a 92% greater insulin response, and a 128% greater storage of
muscle glycogen compared to the AC beverage. These findings demonstrate that
the rate of recovery is coupled with the rate of muscle glycogen replenishment
and suggest that CHO-PRO recovery supplements should be consumed to optimize
muscle recovery.
Williams, M. et al. (2003), ‘Effects of Recovery Beverages
on Glycogen Restoration and Endurance Exercise Performance’, Journal of Strength and Conditioning
Research, vol. 17, no. 1, pp. 12-19.
The Effect of
Carbohydrate and Protein Supplement on Resistance Exercise Performance,
Hormonal Response, and Muscle Damage
The study used 34 male subjects to determine whether
resistance exercise performance and post-exercise muscle damage were altered
when consuming a carbohydrate and protein beverage. Each subject performed
three sets of eight repetitions at their eight repetition maximum to fatigue
for multiple exercises. The results demonstrated that the CHO-PRO supplement reduced
muscle damage and soreness, as evidenced by the elevated response levels of
both myoglobin and creatine kinase.

Protein Supplement on Resistance Exercise Performance, Hormonal Response, and
Muscle Damage’, Journal of Strength and
Conditioning Research, vol. 21, no. 2, pp. 321-329. 

Effect of a
Carbohydrate-Protein Supplement on Endurance Performance During Exercise of
Varying Intensity

In this study nine trained cyclists were given
carbohydrate-protein 
(CHO-PRO) 
beverages and all-carbohydrate (AC) beverages to
compare the effects. Athletes were given supplements every 20 minutes during
three separate testing trials. Carbohydrate supplementation was found to
significantly increase the time to exhaustion, while the addition of protein
enhanced the effect of the carbohydrate supplement. Therefore, the addition of
protein leads to an improved insulin response of a carbohydrate supplement,
resulting in improved aerobic endurance performance.

Both the rise in insulin and replenishment of glycogen are a result of eating high-Glycemic Index (GI) foods, a necessity for achieving optimal recovery immediately following exercise. 

However it is important to understand that not all sugars are equal and some are better than others. While Fructose is one of the worst at creating a high insulin rise with a GI of just 29, Glucose is the best with a GI of 99. AmaMax Rush contains pure Glucose plus other simple sugars to ensure your recovery is maximised.100% Made in Australia.

When Bennett Maxwell mixed up the first batches of AmaMax Rush in his kitchen, he used a Cuisinart mixer. Things have come a long way since then and now every package of Rush will be made in world-class facilities, right here in Melbourne, Australia. 

Our facility adheres to the most stringent quality standards, so you can rest assured that each Rush pack is made exactly like it is intended. Mass production of Rush will be monitored for safety and quality by checking each and every batch. 

Our manufacturer is experienced with high-volume production quantities and has the capacity to meet any demand, so that your order will always be met.

<p><i><b>- How can I
set up to use the Beast sensor once I receive it?</b></i></p>
<p>Install the
Beast App on your smartphone, sign up on our portal with your account, connect
the sensor via Bluetooth and start your workout!</p>
<p><i><b>- How can I
connect Beast to my smartphone?</b></i></p>
<p>Beast takes
advantage of the Bluetooth low energy technology, after you have logged in the
app with your profile, you can choose your sensor and connect to it just
tapping on the screen, the connection interval is super fast! </p>
<p><i><b>- How does
the magnetic connection work?</b></i></p>
<p>Inside the
Beast case there’s a strong magnet. You can simply get your sensor close to
every gym equipment and Beast links on it. Also our body vest it’s made to take
advantage of magnetic connection, so you can do the same with it.</p>
<p><i><b>- How do I
charge the Beast sensor?</b></i></p>
<p>You can
charge your Beast sensor with micro USB cable using your computer or any USB
charger.</p>
<p><i><b>- How long
does the battery last?</b></i></p>
<p>The battery
is designed to last for 5-7 workouts, depending on workout duration.</p>
<p><i><b>- How does
the sensor recognize my movements?</b></i></p>
<p>Beast uses
a combination of inertial sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer)
that can support each other to detect every movement in 3D space. Our patented
algorithm is specifically made to calculate in real time Force, Speed, Power
and Explosiveness of every exercise and to automatically count every repetition
you make.</p>
<p><i><b>- Is it
possible to use the sensor on my wrist just like a common wearable device?</b></i></p>
<p>Of course
you can! We designed a tailor made bracelet for Beast sensor to let you use it
just like a ‘traditional’ wearable device.</p>
<p><i><b>- Which
smartphones will Beast support?</b></i></p>
<p>The Beast
app is working on IOS devices (IPhone 4S, 5, 5C, 5S; IPod Touch, IPad  and IPad mini with Bluetooth 4.0 technology)
and all Android devices which are Bluetooth 4.0 Enabled.</p>
<p><i><b>- What is
the difference between Beast and other fitness trackers?</b></i></p>
<p>Beast
sensor is the first device that guarantees high level real time scientific
measurements necessary to match the expectations of professional strength and
conditioning coaches and athletes. The magnetic system lets you put it not only
on your arm or wrist but on every gym equipment to correctly track every exercise
you make, and on your body vest as well! Ultimately, the very simple user
interface is suitable for every kind of user, professional athlete or not: <u>Beast

<em>In Loving Memory of Marilyn Legge</em>   </h2>

<p>Top
Questions</p></span></h3>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;""><b>What is Skull Shaver
and Horizontal Shavers?</b></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It was almost 85 years ago Col. Jacob Schick invented and
patented the first electric shaver. Skull Shaver makes a dramatic yet simple
change in the design of electric shavers which is more compatible with human
anatomy. Our patented design allows firmer grip and gliding mode for easy access to hard to reach areas
of head and body. Please see the pictures and videos.</span></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;""><b>Are you offering these
shavers for the first time?</b></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We have done one previous trial production run of Skull
Shaver.  The Original Skull Shaver was very
well received by the consumers and we were overwhelmed by the positive reviews given
by the independent newspaper articles, radio shows and other media, as well as
by real consumers on websites like Amazon. Original Skull Shaver offers an excellent value. To make it even more powerful we have added more guts and features to the shaver. And we are generously rewarding our loyal customers by not only having over 50% discount on the new models pre-orders here at Indiegogo but also giving them away two very useful accessories worth up to $50 with pre-order. <a href=""http://www.skullshaver.com/info/NewModelOffer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">See Details</a>. We are in pursuit of making these shavers an excellent new choice of highly knowledgeable consumers.</span></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/50895/files/20130903153708-indie3.JPG?1378247828"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;""><b>Why is the much superior
new model offered here is less expensive than the original model?</b></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">One of the main attraction of original Skull Shaver is its beautiful and practical patented design which is very effective to maintain and sport bald look and for woman to cover large areas fast with dry shave.Our highly acclaimed design stays the same. Anyone who wants to enjoy Skull Shaver can get it from our website or Amazon. You get instant gratification. Any one who has Skull Shaver will also get two additional accessories free with their pre-order at Indiegogo. <a href=""http://www.skullshaver.com/info/NewModelOffer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">See Details</a> . However, we have added some real additional useful features in new models i.e more powerful battery and motor, waterproof body, cordless and corded operation, choice of differently  contoured three rotor shaver head. He will love it and she will love it. It balances out whether you want limited availability Skull Shaver now and get new model and added free accessories in December 2013 or get the new powerful model at a huge discount in December 2013.   </span></p>

<b><i>How Skull Shaver and  Horizontal Shavers were Born</i></b><p></p>
<p>My name is John Lyles, the inventor of Skull Shaver. The idea of designing this unique shaver came to me while traveling in Europe on business. I lived out of a suitcase for months, in and out of hotels daily. I had to get up extra early everyday just to keep my head shaved and this was becoming a real issue for me. So when I returned to the US, I began to design the perfect shaver for head grooming. That's when I started to wonder if there was a product available that would solve my problem.  It seemed like such an obvious, everyday problem that I assumed someone else had already invented something to solve it. I looked for it in department stores, drug stores and online. Surprisingly, I found nothing.  You could get shavers that state they are designed for head grooming but nothing like I had envisioned. I wanted something that was electric, allows dry shaving, can access the back of my head with ease, no mess and that would also save me hundreds of dollars on disposable razors and no more lather.</p>
<p><b><i>What if the funding goals are not met? Would you be producing these models?</i></b></p>
<p>Yes we will. Our financing cost will be a little higher. (see Updates)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/59169/files/20130907104829-wom2.JPG?1378576109"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I started drawing sketches of Skull Shaver. I bought molding clay at A.C. Moore to begin making simple molds of the imagined product. I was pretty satisfied with the result. I began discussing the project with some close friends. I realized that I will need more resources and skills to get the project moving. At this point my friend and business associate Neel Kulshreshtha came on board. That was almost three years ago.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/45365/files/20130831181106-clay2.jpg?1377997866"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span><p></p>
<p>Since then we went through several hurdles - prototyping in Kansas, patent work in the USA and overseas. We had to do a lot more design work in the USA for tooling and manufacturing, etc. We looked at our competition which has almost all the manufacturing done overseas and we simply could not be able to compete with them with the high manufacturing cost in the USA. We began searching for an appropriate manufacturer overseas. It had to be a quality manufacturer and the one who treats its employees with dignity and provides with fair wages and amenities.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Shavers come with 3 or 4 or 5 Rotary Cutters Heads</b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This unique patented ergonomic design is the first of its kind as you can feel your skin as you shave. It makes it easy to shave hard to reach areas in the back of your head without looking in a mirror. The shaver head contours to every curve of your head, body and face as you shave. It will also eliminate cuts, nicks, bumps and irritation. Best of all - it can be used anywhere, anytime without the mess. It provides a fast and clean dry shave. Women also find it very convenient for anywhere, anytime shave!</span><br/></p>

<p></p></span><p>Among family and friends, some women tried Skull Shaver on their legs. Most of them reacted very positively. Because of its large head, it shaves a much larger area faster. It also allows a dry shave. So, we realized that there is also a need for a woman's shaver with all these features.</p>

<p>Despite overwhelmingly positive reviews, we are aware that a lot more has to be done to bring out the best electric shavers. We need a  strong and consistent performance of the motor, battery, and packing. We were required to learn a few more lessons in the real world school.</p>
<p>We went out again with more stringent manufacturing requirements to bring out the best possible electric shaver with our designs. We interviewed several potential manufacturers with our stringent manufacturing criteria as well the manufacturer’s history of its treatment of employees. We realized that we will be able to accomplish that, but it will not be cheap.</p>
<p>Our limited experience shows that there is a real demand for our shavers. Your pledges will allow us to do a full run of both the Bald Eagle shaver series for men and the Butterfly shaver series for women.</p>

Questions

What is Skull Shaver
and Horizontal Shavers?
It was almost 85 years ago Col. Jacob Schick invented and
patented the first electric shaver. Skull Shaver makes a dramatic yet simple
change in the design of electric shavers which is more compatible with human
anatomy. Our patented design allows firmer grip and gliding mode for easy access to hard to reach areas
of head and body. Please see the pictures and videos.
Are you offering these
shavers for the first time?
We have done one previous trial production run of Skull
Shaver.  The Original Skull Shaver was very
well received by the consumers and we were overwhelmed by the positive reviews given
by the independent newspaper articles, radio shows and other media, as well as
by real consumers on websites like Amazon. Original Skull Shaver offers an excellent value. To make it even more powerful we have added more guts and features to the shaver. And we are generously rewarding our loyal customers by not only having over 50% discount on the new models pre-orders here at Indiegogo but also giving them away two very useful accessories worth up to $50 with pre-order. See Details. We are in pursuit of making these shavers an excellent new choice of highly knowledgeable consumers.



Why is the much superior
new model offered here is less expensive than the original model?
One of the main attraction of original Skull Shaver is its beautiful and practical patented design which is very effective to maintain and sport bald look and for woman to cover large areas fast with dry shave.Our highly acclaimed design stays the same. Anyone who wants to enjoy Skull Shaver can get it from our website or Amazon. You get instant gratification. Any one who has Skull Shaver will also get two additional accessories free with their pre-order at Indiegogo. See Details . However, we have added some real additional useful features in new models i.e more powerful battery and motor, waterproof body, cordless and corded operation, choice of differently  contoured three rotor shaver head. He will love it and she will love it. It balances out whether you want limited availability Skull Shaver now and get new model and added free accessories in December 2013 or get the new powerful model at a huge discount in December 2013.   




We are in pursuit of
  the perfect electric shaver!




Human
Anatomy Compatible™






How Skull Shaver and  Horizontal Shavers were Born
My name is John Lyles, the inventor of Skull Shaver. The idea of designing this unique shaver came to me while traveling in Europe on business. I lived out of a suitcase for months, in and out of hotels daily. I had to get up extra early everyday just to keep my head shaved and this was becoming a real issue for me. So when I returned to the US, I began to design the perfect shaver for head grooming. That's when I started to wonder if there was a product available that would solve my problem.  It seemed like such an obvious, everyday problem that I assumed someone else had already invented something to solve it. I looked for it in department stores, drug stores and online. Surprisingly, I found nothing.  You could get shavers that state they are designed for head grooming but nothing like I had envisioned. I wanted something that was electric, allows dry shaving, can access the back of my head with ease, no mess and that would also save me hundreds of dollars on disposable razors and no more lather.
What if the funding goals are not met? Would you be producing these models?
Yes we will. Our financing cost will be a little higher. (see Updates)





I started drawing sketches of Skull Shaver. I bought molding clay at A.C. Moore to begin making simple molds of the imagined product. I was pretty satisfied with the result. I began discussing the project with some close friends. I realized that I will need more resources and skills to get the project moving. At this point my friend and business associate Neel Kulshreshtha came on board. That was almost three years ago.


Since then we went through several hurdles - prototyping in Kansas, patent work in the USA and overseas. We had to do a lot more design work in the USA for tooling and manufacturing, etc. We looked at our competition which has almost all the manufacturing done overseas and we simply could not be able to compete with them with the high manufacturing cost in the USA. We began searching for an appropriate manufacturer overseas. It had to be a quality manufacturer and the one who treats its employees with dignity and provides with fair wages and amenities. 



Shavers come with 3 or 4 or 5 Rotary Cutters Heads
This unique patented ergonomic design is the first of its kind as you can feel your skin as you shave. It makes it easy to shave hard to reach areas in the back of your head without looking in a mirror. The shaver head contours to every curve of your head, body and face as you shave. It will also eliminate cuts, nicks, bumps and irritation. Best of all - it can be used anywhere, anytime without the mess. It provides a fast and clean dry shave. Women also find it very convenient for anywhere, anytime shave!




Among family and friends, some women tried Skull Shaver on their legs. Most of them reacted very positively. Because of its large head, it shaves a much larger area faster. It also allows a dry shave. So, we realized that there is also a need for a woman's shaver with all these features.
Feel As You Shave™





The Details
We did our first trial production run of Skull Shaver with very limited resources on hand. The feedbacks have been overwhelmingly positive on design, concept and convenience. We have been featured and noticed by major newspapers and other media. Following are a few:

Top Ten Reviews
Despite overwhelmingly positive reviews, we are aware that a lot more has to be done to bring out the best electric shavers. We need a  strong and consistent performance of the motor, battery, and packing. We were required to learn a few more lessons in the real world school.
We went out again with more stringent manufacturing requirements to bring out the best possible electric shaver with our designs. We interviewed several potential manufacturers with our stringent manufacturing criteria as well the manufacturer’s history of its treatment of employees. We realized that we will be able to accomplish that, but it will not be cheap.
Our limited experience shows that there is a real demand for our shavers. Your pledges will allow us to do a full run of both the Bald Eagle shaver series for men and the Butterfly shaver series for women.
 This shaver will transform the way men and women shave their heads, faces and bodies.

Risks and Challenges
Your contributions will help us on top of the 100k in development we've already spent ourselves. We still need to begin production on the injection mold tooling, MOQs and associated advertising expenses. Indiegogo funds will go to offset these costs.
Our faith has grown stronger after we've noticed the overwhelming support for the design, concept and convenience of these shavers.
The risks of orders not being fulfilled on time is very low. No additional development is required for the Skull Shaver. The purchase orders for the production materials are written and ready to be enacted. Until this point, we have purchased trial shavers in small quantities which have significantly increased our cost per unit. Purchasing the production mold will allow us to finish the production order in larger quantities to lower our cost per unit and supply enough shavers to meet the current demand.

are many children in America who experience these traumas for all their past
and future lives living with Celiac disease. They have behavioral
issues, neurologic challenges, embarrassing digestive issues, fear &amp; insecurity issues - all resulting from
their bodies' rejection of gluten. These children will become adults with
special dietary needs, meaning the potential of years of struggling and not fitting in. </p>
<p>Their special needs mean so much more. It means struggling, fighting temptations, being sick and in the same time
staying strong, trying to integrate in the developing modern society and trying
to be normal while aware that normal could kill them.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Celiac
disease is a genetic disorder affecting children and adults. People with celiac
disease are unable to eat foods that contain gluten, which is found in wheat
and other grains. In people with celiac disease, gluten sets off an autoimmune
reaction that causes the destruction of the villi in the small intestine.
People with celiac disease produce antibodies that attack the intestine,
causing damage and illness. Nearly 1 out of every 133 Americans suffer
from celiac disease, according to a study conducted by the Center for Celiac
Research in Massachusetts. </span><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This campaign is all
about these children. We are committed to helping children located in
Indiana and the surrounding states by organizing an overnight camp (4
nights/3 days) focused on the gluten-free community bringing education, events,
a specific food educational program and a series of fun activities for the
children to enjoy while they learn how to stay healthy, develop higher self esteem and learn to deal with some challenging issues. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/618064/files/20140601090157-fireside.jpg?1401638517"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">We
want to give 40 kids the opportunity to experience a different perspective of
having special needs. We are preparing a fun-filled ""normal""
week with peers who have similar dietary issues. The daily program will
include team building activities, leadership development, and many activities
centered on developing self confidence and dealing with the daily challenges
that Celiac Disease and Gluten Intolerance can create. We will ensure
three full meals of delicious gluten-free foods, snacks, and all the camp
experiences that create lasting memories.</span><br/></p><p></p><p></p>

These kids adhere to a strict gluten-free, dairy-free, peanut-free diet for their entire life due to the risk of so many horrible reactions up to and including death.  Not to mention that 1/3 of all kids with Food Allergies are bullied.  It can stop with you!I am a parent of a Celiac Child, who was diagnosed almost 8 years  ago.  There have been times his experiences have ripped my heart out.  Instead of giving up, I made the decision that sharing education with the community and school was far more important.  Watching people completely alienate him, peers tease him, and hearing kids say things like, ""My mother said I can't invite you to my birthday party because we aren't having any thing gluten free for you"", only continued to remind me how important it was to educate and assist in the mission to keep our kids safe and allow them to have the same experiences as other kids.   (As you see below, Celiac has not stopped our son from loving many of the same things other boys love!)                                      I also helped to co-found Gluten Free Living Now in Indy.  We held our first camp in 2012, but were unable to raise the funding for more camps.  GFLN hosted three annual Gluten Free Expo's in Carmel, but has since been purchased by Living Without Magazine.  The camp was not purchased, so we are still trying to raise private funding for the camp.                                 This flag was designed by our Inaugural campers.  It will hopefully fly proudly at the 2015 Camp!  Camp Gluten Freedom held its first and only Gluten Free Allergen Free camp in 2012, but I remain hopeful and steadfast in my commitment and that the community will unite in raising funds to make this camp happen again in the summer of 2015.    For 2015 our business sponsor is a2z Scrapbooking Supplies, who donate funds to the autoimmune community.  Why send these kids to a separate, dedicated allergen-free camp? Have
you ever tried to keep a diet even for one day? Were you able to resist and
finalize it or you just gave in to the temptation of eating that
chocolate? How about not eating chocolate at all for your whole life? How
would you live having all the best stuff prohibited because it could be deadly?
Imagine
you have to maintain a strict diet all your life because your body says so...because you have a
genetic disorder that you cannot correct.  You often feel that no one understands your needs and
your behavior and that this disease has many hard and challenging times.  Can you imagine how confusing and frustrating this can be for a child?There
are many children in America who experience these traumas for all their past
and future lives living with Celiac disease. They have behavioral
issues, neurologic challenges, embarrassing digestive issues, fear & insecurity issues - all resulting from
their bodies' rejection of gluten. These children will become adults with
special dietary needs, meaning the potential of years of struggling and not fitting in. 
Their special needs mean so much more. It means struggling, fighting temptations, being sick and in the same time
staying strong, trying to integrate in the developing modern society and trying
to be normal while aware that normal could kill them.
Celiac
disease is a genetic disorder affecting children and adults. People with celiac
disease are unable to eat foods that contain gluten, which is found in wheat
and other grains. In people with celiac disease, gluten sets off an autoimmune
reaction that causes the destruction of the villi in the small intestine.
People with celiac disease produce antibodies that attack the intestine,
causing damage and illness. Nearly 1 out of every 133 Americans suffer
from celiac disease, according to a study conducted by the Center for Celiac
Research in Massachusetts. 

This campaign is all
about these children. We are committed to helping children located in
Indiana and the surrounding states by organizing an overnight camp (4
nights/3 days) focused on the gluten-free community bringing education, events,
a specific food educational program and a series of fun activities for the
children to enjoy while they learn how to stay healthy, develop higher self esteem and learn to deal with some challenging issues. We
want to give 40 kids the opportunity to experience a different perspective of
having special needs. We are preparing a fun-filled ""normal""
week with peers who have similar dietary issues. The daily program will
include team building activities, leadership development, and many activities
centered on developing self confidence and dealing with the daily challenges
that Celiac Disease and Gluten Intolerance can create. We will ensure
three full meals of delicious gluten-free foods, snacks, and all the camp
experiences that create lasting memories.

Having
the experience of an amazingly successful previous camp in 2012, it was an honor to meet these kids and work through some definite life changing issues. In order to make this possible we
need close to $15,000 in order to secure the facility, activity, food and
support & instructor costs for this year's edition of the 2015 Camp Gluten Freedom - A Gluten Free Allergen Free Camp for Kids!       Testimonials:  Letters from previous session in 2012 ""I learned to explain my special needs and
now I feel confident in making new friends who won't laugh at me.""                                                           10-year old girl

This is for all the walking friends of Laura, to help her get the working cushions she needs for her wheelchair ride to be as comfortable as she deserves. This is our chance to give back to one of the most beautiful people we know.</div>
<div>
<h3>Cushions Aren't Forever?</h3>
<p>Recently, Laura had a problem with her medical grade cushion on her wheelchair. It is designed to prevent bedsores by providing an air-ride for the countless hours she spends sitting, day after day, as she travels around, visiting with friends and family. Unexpectedly, her cushion developed a small leak. She tried several solutions, all the way to asking the cushion manufacturer for help. Aside from a total cushion replacement, she didn't find a solution, leaving her no choice but to use the wheelchair without an air pad. Most of us wouldnt be bothered by that, because we dont live in a wheelchair. But to Laura, this was a humongous problem, one that could create medical concerns for sitting on such a surface for such a length of time. And on top of that was the cost of replacement.<br/><br/>Laura's insurance does provide a solution for this situation, but not in a timely manner. In fact, Laura has been without the comfort of her cushion for a week and a half so far, with no less than another 7 days before receiving a new cushion. What if one of us had to spend two and a half weeks unable to walk around because our shoes caused bleeding blisters? What if we had to wait such a length of time before we could leave our house and be a part of the world again because our benefit provider was slow to pay?<br/><br/>Well, the good news is we don't need to fix Laura's insurance provider. All we need to do is give back to this wonderful friend who has been a beautiful example of hope, and faith, and love for so many of us. Her enduring devotion to her God and to her friends, has been so grounding and humbling for all of us. If we each donate as we can, we can reach the goal for Laura to be able to buy a cushion on her own, without waiting on the untimeliness of her insurance company. Each cushion ranges from $300-$400. The goal of $1500 would allow her to buy up to 4 in advance, never having to be in this situation again.</p>
<h3>We Can Help Our Friend</h3>
<p>Two and a half weeks ago, Laura asked her Facebook friends to assist her. ""<span class=""messageBody""><span class=""userContent"">My FB friend, I have a dilema, I got a hole in my Wheelchair cushion and would anybody, know how i can get it repaired without it costing me an arm and leg?

She followed all those leads, and had to seek help from her insurance company because of the price of the kit, and a new cushion.</span></span> Shame on her medical provider for the wait, but shame on us, her friends...because we can fix this!</p>
<p>Laura has been feeling the frustration of being homebound, but with her usual gracefulness, all she posted to her friends on Facebook was: ""<span class=""userContent"">Pray for me, as I have been in my house for 8 days now, due to a hole in my wheelchair cushion that was not fixable, &amp; I'm waiting on the Base Hospital Doctor to call me &amp; give me approval to get a new Wheelchair cushion, then when that is approved it will probably take another week to get it to the house, so that will be 3wks that I have been in my house, I WANT VISITOR'S PLEASE!!</span>""</p>
<p>We all know Laura. This situation has been way too educational into the issues of healthcare, and the difficulties our friend has experienced with just the issue of a minor leak in her wonderful cushions. Most of us will live our lives never having to face such a limitation, or such a dilemna. We can't give our friend legs to run, but we can help her by making sure she has the most comfortable ride for her journey. $1500 should pay for 4 cushions for her chair, and the 4% cost of this site to make it all happen (<a href=""http://www.1800wheelchair.com/asp/view-category-products.asp?category_id=821"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.1800wheelchair.com/asp/view-category-products.asp?category_id=821</a>). If you want to give more, please do. The cost of this need caught her by surprise...future finances will help her be prepared. At the least, stop by on her Facebook page and say hello, and tell her you are thinking of her.</p>

<p>Jada is 48 years old and she loves her pets; 3 dogs and 2 cats. She also enjoys camping and woodworking. She is an outgoing person and enjoys spending time with her friends. Let’s help get Jada back to enjoying life!</p>
<p>My sister in law, Jada, was critically injured in a roll over crash just outside of Reno Nevada on October 6, 2012. She was air lifted to the hospital which is where this long journey begins:</p>
<p>Within the first 24 hours they weren't detecting a pulse in her hand which was badly injured in the crash. They needed to do surgery to save her hand but weren't sure if she would be able to go through the surgery. They deemed the surgery ""safe enough"" to save her hand and went ahead with the surgery. During that same surgery, the plastic surgeon worked on closing up the wounds to her head.</p>
<p>After surgery, the pressure was rising in her head. The scans didn't show any specific reason why it should be rising, so they put her into a medically induced coma and she is currently still in that state. </p>
<p>On October 10th they tried to lift her out of the coma state to see how her vitals would react and she did not respond well at all. They immediately stopped that and will try again in a few days.</p>
<p>In the meantime, my brother Mark, remains by her side. He is currently taking time off work to be with Jada, and his work says he can take all the time he needs. But we all know what that means, no work = no money coming in.</p>
<p>I am starting this campaign to help ease some of the burden from my brother. I want him to focus on Jada, her recovery, and himself. There is a very long road ahead of them. According to the neurosurgeon, once she awakens they will know more about what the extent of damage to her brain is. The doctors have said be prepared for her to possibly be asleep for weeks, then extensive recovery in the hospital, then extensive rehabilitation etc.</p>
<p>Please help with our campaign to help offset the cost of the medical bills and day to day bills that will continue to add up as they move forward with Jada's recovery. If you aren't able to give at this time please share this campaign and help us spread the word. We would also please ask that you pray for a full recovery for Jada and pray for strength and comfort for my brother Mark as well.</p>
<p>God Bless!</p>

After surgery, the pressure was rising in her head. The scans didn't show any specific reason why it should be rising, so they put her into a medically induced coma and she is currently still in that state. 
On October 10th they tried to lift her out of the coma state to see how her vitals would react and she did not respond well at all. They immediately stopped that and will try again in a few days.
In the meantime, my brother Mark, remains by her side. He is currently taking time off work to be with Jada, and his work says he can take all the time he needs. But we all know what that means, no work = no money coming in.
I am starting this campaign to help ease some of the burden from my brother. I want him to focus on Jada, her recovery, and himself. There is a very long road ahead of them. According to the neurosurgeon, once she awakens they will know more about what the extent of damage to her brain is. The doctors have said be prepared for her to possibly be asleep for weeks, then extensive recovery in the hospital, then extensive rehabilitation etc.
Please help with our campaign to help offset the cost of the medical bills and day to day bills that will continue to add up as they move forward with Jada's recovery. If you aren't able to give at this time please share this campaign and help us spread the word. We would also please ask that you pray for a full recovery for Jada and pray for strength and comfort for my brother Mark as well.

<h1>Project Protect</h1>
<p>The goal of our project is to empower patients, parents, and care-takers with high quality and easy to understand information about antibiotics and infections.  We are doing this with printed material, ebooks, and a smartphone app.  Right now we are raising the funds to create printed materials and an ebook.  Later stages of the project will include developing the smartphone app.</p>
<p>The immediate actions made available through this project will include gathering and summarizing the information most important for patients to have, medical editing of the information, translation into Spanish, Hmong, and Punjabi, printing of materials, creation of an ebook, and distribution of materials to new mothers, elder people, and athletes in our community through daycare centers, senior centers, and sports teams.</p>
<p>The funds that we raise will cover the production and postage for the perks, professional printing of the guide to antibiotics and distribution to seniors, new moms, and sports teams in Merced.  If funds allow, we will also develop an app that people can take with them to the doctors office on a mobile device.   Future plans include creating a Project Protect website, continuing to make youtube videos, sponsoring an art contest to generate good images for antibiotic resistance, a web comic about resistance, a flashmob to promote awareness, and undergraduate research with Mercy Medical Center.</p>
<p>We are doing as much of this as we can with volunteers and freely available resources, but printing in color is expensive, as is professional filming, stock photos, and app development.  There are also miscellaneous website and computer software costs.  Sponsoring an art contest will also have direct costs in the form of prizes and indirect costs associated with website development.</p>

<h2><b>Why this project is important</b></h2>
<p>How many people do you know who have become sick from bacteria, or from antibiotics?  The numbers are astounding.  It is a problem for everyone.  Maybe that person is you, maybe a loved one, a family member, a neighbor, a classmate, or a friend.  We all know someone who  has been affected by antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>Sometimes antibiotics don't work and people are hospitalized or die.</p>
<p>Sometimes antibiotics have dangerous side effects.</p>
<p>Sometimes stomachs hurt badly for a very long time after taking antibiotics.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><b><br/></b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><b>This project is for people who have become sick from bacteria or from antibiotics, and for the people who love them.</b></span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>Worldwide statistics</b></h2>
<p>-Antibiotic resistant bacteria kill more people every year than HIV/AIDS. </p>
<p>-In the United States alone, there are annually at least 120,000 deaths from antibiotic resistant infections that are improperly treated due to a scarcity of reliable antibiotics.  </p>
<p>-There are at least 80,000 limb amputations</p>
<p>-There are 1.7 million multidrug resistant hospital acquired infections that extend hospital stays, increase medical expenses and decrease quality of life. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>People who are the most threatened</b></h2>
<p>People under the age of 3 and over the age of 60, and those who are immunocompromised are the most vulnerable to resistant infections. </p>
<p>Side effects of antibiotics are also worse in elderly populations.</p>
<p><b>This project is to help everyone have the information they need to keep themselves and their families safe from resistant bacteria.</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i><b>Project Protect has three goals</b></i></p>

<p>We are going to distribute the guide through senior centers, daycare centers, nursing homes, and clinics.</p>
<p>Because this is a grassroots effort, and so many students are involved, it gives us a unique opportunity to reach people who might not be interested in resistance.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have other important missions too, that we would like to address later, or if funding allows, as an after effect of this campaign.</p>
<p>2. <i><b>Research-</b></i> Evolutionary biology holds the keys to unlocking solutions for fighting resistant superbugs. Bacteria evolve antibiotic resistance.  We have found a way of reversing evolution.  We need some help to test it out enough to be able to safely use it.<br/></p>
<p><b>3.</b> <b><i>Impact</i></b>- Our local hospital is working with us to show that our method of reversing evolution works. They provide us with resistant strains and pharmacy records so that we can do research in a real clinical environment. We are identifying antibiotics that they can cycle among hospital patients to stop antibiotic resistant superbugs from evolving. The discoveries we make here will most likely apply to hospitals in other cities as well.</p>

-When the US Government committed to spending more money to find a cure for HIV/AIDS, the funds for that research were taken from public health management and infectious disease research and public health monitoring.
-Bioterrorism research took even more money from public health management and antibiotic resistance research. 
-There are very few private funds for public health management and antibiotic resistance research.

<h3>From the Beginning</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);""></span></h3>
<p>This journey started over a year
ago when Tammy started seeing a pain specialist because of the chronic severe
pain she was having in her legs and lower back.  During this year, they had tested her blood
over 8 times and not once did they check her white blood count or anything
other than to make sure she wasn't on drugs. </p>
<p>In the middle of June Tammy discovered
strange lump in her neck. After consulting with her sister in law while on
vacation, who is a certified nurse, she decided she needed to get them checked
out. After going back home, it was a couple of weeks before she got in to see
the doctor. The doctors started doing tests on July 18 2013. The first set of
result came back with her white count being over 20,000 (normal range is
between 8,000 and 10,000). They started her on steroids and antibiotics immediately;
hoping that is was just an infection. The following week, they tested her white
count again and it was over 28,000. At that point they realized it was a much
bigger problem than just an infection and starting doing more extensive test (i.e.
X-rays, MRI’s, blood, etc.). On July 24<sup>th</sup>, they did a biopsy on the lymph
nodes in her neck and groin. During this time they found something suspicious
on her white cells, which they sent in for further tests. Because of the
suspicious findings in her white blood cells, the primary doctor sent her to a
blood specialist for further testing and diagnosis. On August 16<sup>th</sup>,
Tammy got the results back that she has stage four non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. She
has different strains of the cancer, one is fast moving and the other is slow
moving. At this point, they took her straight in to test her bone marrow, which
they later found out that because the cancer had spread so quickly her bone
marrow was also affected. </p>
<p>Approximately 12 days after the
initial diagnosis and many tests later they started her first chemotherapy
treatment on August 28<sup>th</sup>. During the first treatment, she had a
severe reaction to rituxan, a part of the chemotherapy treatment. She started
having heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and the doctors were expecting
her heart to stop.  After they reversed
the reaction of the drug she did much better. 
Because of her treatments and the severity of the pain, she had to go on
leave from her job, being a care taker for Alzheimer patients.  On Monday September 16<sup>th</sup>, they
denied her from getting short term disability because they said she hasn't
worked long enough. The only time she has ever taken off of work was so she
could raise her children, but because of this they are penalizing her. Her
second treatment was  two days later on
September 18<sup>th</sup>, where again she had a reaction to rituxan, which
they finally determined she was allergic to and they would have to continue the
chemotherapy regimen without it. </p>

This journey started over a year
ago when Tammy started seeing a pain specialist because of the chronic severe
pain she was having in her legs and lower back.  During this year, they had tested her blood
over 8 times and not once did they check her white blood count or anything
other than to make sure she wasn't on drugs. 
In the middle of June Tammy discovered
strange lump in her neck. After consulting with her sister in law while on
vacation, who is a certified nurse, she decided she needed to get them checked
out. After going back home, it was a couple of weeks before she got in to see
the doctor. The doctors started doing tests on July 18 2013. The first set of
result came back with her white count being over 20,000 (normal range is
between 8,000 and 10,000). They started her on steroids and antibiotics immediately;
hoping that is was just an infection. The following week, they tested her white
count again and it was over 28,000. At that point they realized it was a much
bigger problem than just an infection and starting doing more extensive test (i.e.
X-rays, MRI’s, blood, etc.). On July 24th, they did a biopsy on the lymph
nodes in her neck and groin. During this time they found something suspicious
on her white cells, which they sent in for further tests. Because of the
suspicious findings in her white blood cells, the primary doctor sent her to a

<p>Mario came to the sad conclusion that people with disabilities still had few opportunities to release their full potential.
In particular, they could not move, use their hands, stand up because the
wheelchair, something they use every day, squanders their freedom, life quality
and relationships with others. </p>
<br/><p>Standard wheelchairs are of a time when people with disabilities were thought
to be unable to work let alone win medals at Olympic Games.  While times
have changed -people with disabilities do win gold medals -;  the
wheelchair has not. While horse carriages have been replaced by sports
cars or motorbikes in less than 100 years, the wheelchair has stayed the same:
limited. While some of us have the choice to drive a Jeep, a Corvette or a
Harley, others are left with a chair they need to push with their hands. </p>

<p><b>Rib cage</b>: an ergonomic posture keeps the breathing pattern regular,
improving the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p><b>Thoracic diaphragm</b>:compression on the diaphragm is drastically
reduced, facilitating the digestion process and bowel movements.</p>
<p><b>Abdomen and gluteal region</b>: effective prevention of back pain. MarioWay

<p><b>Upper limbs</b>: MarioWay prevents tendinitis and brachial neuralgia.</p>
<p><b>Lower limbs</b>: MarioWay prevents swollen legs, feet and ankle due to a
fixed, traditional seated position thanks to the peripheral vascular
circulation generated by the MarioWay mechanic up-and-down movement.</p>
<p><b>Ergonomic sitting position at variable heights</b>: the weight load on the lumbar spine district
is almost zeroed.  MarioWay prevents decubitus ulcers; it also prevents
osteopenia (that is, below-average bone mineral density).</p>

We made it 100% adaptable (adapted to the users' characteristics and tastes), quick, and beautiful. No more chunky metal frames that stigmatize people with disabilities. We wanted to create something that all of us would want to ride. As we were developing MarioWay, we kept asking ourselves: would George Clooney ride this? </p>

<p>The wheels are the result of the best application of technology and craftsmanship developed for exclusive motorcycles. The rim was created with a CNC
flow-forming and metal spinning machine. </p>
<p>It is then hardened and shaped
inside out with a lathe. This makes it very special because the rim does not have
any welds and is thus a perfect circle.</p>
<p>The alloy used is an aluminum
alloy grade 6082 that has been strain hardened with thermal treatment T6. The 24
M6 wheel spokes and hub are made of high strength 304 grade stainless steel and are
obtained by cold forging. </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The external finishing is
achieved by black anodizing so there will be not any paint chips, sleek, and it

<p></p></div>","Mario came to the sad conclusion that people with disabilities still had few opportunities to release their full potential.
In particular, they could not move, use their hands, stand up because the
wheelchair, something they use every day, squanders their freedom, life quality
and relationships with others. 
Standard wheelchairs are of a time when people with disabilities were thought
to be unable to work let alone win medals at Olympic Games.  While times
have changed -people with disabilities do win gold medals -;  the
wheelchair has not. While horse carriages have been replaced by sports
cars or motorbikes in less than 100 years, the wheelchair has stayed the same:
limited. While some of us have the choice to drive a Jeep, a Corvette or a
Harley, others are left with a chair they need to push with their hands. 
This doesn't sound
right, does it?This is why a prototype named ""MarioWay"" was born: to start a true revolution, create an electricity-propelled, hands-free mobility device so extraordinary that everyone will desire it.For this, we need your help!How ? Starting in 2012, we have prepared a business plan, done some calculations on the viability of the project, set-up a Social Entreprise, built 2 prototypes, found top-class suppliers. Now it's your turn: to make this project happen, from the people to the people, with no other intermediaries, we have set up a global-fund raising campaign here. 
   


WHO WE ARE
Mario Vigentini - 'the man of vision' has 20 years experience in working with people with developmental disabilities.
Lorenzo
Pompei - 'the first backer' is a social business entrepreneur who has backed up various social and community initiatives.
Massimo Ghidelli, Samuele Reali and Stefano Martinelli from
AbnormalCycles - 'the magicians',  are the award winning mechanics and designers behind the MarioWay.


                                                                   
OUR IMPACT: LIVES ARE TRANSFORMED





MarioWay creates autonomy 
MarioWay moves through balancing the upper torso leaving people's hands and arms free to do whatever they like without any assistance: play basketball, shoot a movie, talking over the phone while on the street etc.
Its size allows people to pass through the average doorway on their own making it possible for them to go to places previously inaccessible to them. 

MarioWay transforms relationships
The user is at a standing height, making eye contact or shaking hands simple again. Breaking away from the seating position of traditional wheelchairs, MarioWay improves communication and interpersonal relationships. 
Its mechanical suspensions protect the users from the discomfort of bumps and holes during a ride.
MarioWay provides real physical benefitsIts purpose-built seat and knee rest allow the user to comfortably rest while being out and about in town and at home. MarioWay can also be used to exercise the body.







Neck: reduction of neck pain and migraine that are
caused by the muscle tension involved in the traditional wheelchair sitting
posture.
Eyes: improved postural comfort can boost attention and efficiency
due to a decreased musculoskeletal pain.
Rib cage: an ergonomic posture keeps the breathing pattern regular,
improving the cardiovascular system.
Thoracic diaphragm:compression on the diaphragm is drastically
reduced, facilitating the digestion process and bowel movements.
Abdomen and gluteal region: effective prevention of back pain. MarioWay
allows a natural angle between the hip bones and the femur. It reinforces the
core muscles of the back.
Upper limbs: MarioWay prevents tendinitis and brachial neuralgia.
Lower limbs: MarioWay prevents swollen legs, feet and ankle due to a
fixed, traditional seated position thanks to the peripheral vascular
circulation generated by the MarioWay mechanic up-and-down movement.
Ergonomic sitting position at variable heights: the weight load on the lumbar spine district
is almost zeroed.  MarioWay prevents decubitus ulcers; it also prevents
osteopenia (that is, below-average bone mineral density).



MarioWay removes stigma 
While there are some stand up wheel chairs in the market, Marioway is unique in that it combines Made in USA technology with Italian mechanics, craftsmanship and sophisticated design. We made it 100% adaptable (adapted to the users' characteristics and tastes), quick, and beautiful. No more chunky metal frames that stigmatize people with disabilities. We wanted to create something that all of us would want to ride. As we were developing MarioWay, we kept asking ourselves: would George Clooney ride this? 
By supporting us, you will be funding more than a revolutionary chair, you will transforms lives, relationships and people. You will help narrow the gap between people in terms of their life quality.







PROTOTYPE TECHNICAL DATA




Distance from the ground to the base: 3.35 inches (8.5 cm)


Width:  24.8 inches (63 cm)


Full-battery travel range: 16 ~ 24.2 miles (26 ~ 39 km)


Radius curve: zero.


Maximum speed: 12.4 mph (20 kmph).


Total weight: 105.8lbs (48kgs) (base, batteries and wheels included) + 57.3lbs (26kgs) (aluminum upper structure, seat and knee rests).

User minimum weight: 66lbs (30kgs).
User maximum weight: 198.5lbs (90kgs)

Total maximum moving mass: 361.5lbs (164kgs) 


                                                                                        


WHEELS




The wheels are the result of the best application of technology and craftsmanship developed for exclusive motorcycles. The rim was created with a CNC
flow-forming and metal spinning machine. 
It is then hardened and shaped
inside out with a lathe. This makes it very special because the rim does not have
any welds and is thus a perfect circle.
The alloy used is an aluminum
alloy grade 6082 that has been strain hardened with thermal treatment T6. The 24
M6 wheel spokes and hub are made of high strength 304 grade stainless steel and are
obtained by cold forging. 
The external finishing is
achieved by black anodizing so there will be not any paint chips, sleek, and it
improves its resistance.
All components are made in
Italy except for the tyres (Segway original 100/60x14 tube type).




                                                            



CUSTOMIZATION


MarioWay can be customized in different ways. 

Adjustable seatIts seat height is adjustable in a number of positions between full upright and sitting. center of gravity etc. MarioWay adapts to a wide range of body weights and shapes including the length of the user’s femur and shinbone. It can be adapted to lower-limb amputated users.

Have your own MarioWayUsers will be able to have their MarioWay customized to their personal tastes by choosing the color and material of the seat or adding accessories. 

WHAT WE NEED 


We need to raise $140, 000 in order to:

make it even better: we want to create Prototype 3.0 in Q1 2014, which will have decubitus preventive material for the seat and knee pads, added comfort and additional safety measures. See the sketch below




get the CE certification: we need this to start production (and yes, it is a tedious task but it needs to be done) 
obtain international patent: another must if we want to change the lives of people around the world
manufacture the first 10 MarioWays to be commercialized (yeah!!!)
Observe and learn: we want to carry out a study on 100 potential users to understand their needs and help us improve MarioWay and develop the MarioWay community
develop Smartphone Apps for training and fitness programs.

RISKS AND CHALLENGES



Economies of scales: we need a minimum orders to start production and keep the business sustainable.


Quality, craftsmanship at an affordable price: we need to focus on keeping costs under control and deliver the best possible quality, whilst avoiding relocation to low-cost countries. We think businesses have social responsibility in terms of developing their communities including local suppliers, customers and supporters.


Certification: we will need to go through several certification processes (CE, FCC) as well as pre-clearance and registration (think of the FDA in the US) before being able to market MarioWays.


Recourse to multiple gyroscopic mobility devices: in our quest for quality, the first choice fell on Segway®;  we can consider similar work on other brands


Keep a green, ethical, sustainable, socially-aware business whilst generating stakeholder positive returns





FAQs

What price tag will the MarioWay have? Depending on the level of customization required by
the user, we aim at selling standard MarioWays in the region of $16k/$20k. We
understand that is quite pricey, but the technology and components used justify
this tag. Our goal is to make this device increasingly accessible to more people.
Up to what level of disability can the MW be used? We have so far successfully tested
with a T9 user; bearing in mind that this is just prototype 2.1, we aim to
raise our goals and progress for disabilities stemming from upper SCIs.
What certifications are you looking for?  To enter in production, we will need to pass industry
standard certifications such as CE, TÜV. If used as a medical device, we will
seek approval to the relevant authority 
for each country.
Trials. With
the funds raised, we will dedicate time to clinical trials on a sample of
SCI-affected people to observe the use and feed-back from potential users.
When do you plan to have the MarioWay in production? We are looking at Q1 2015
Where can it be found? Our target markets are Europe, Northern America and
Australia to start with.
How can I carry a MarioWay around with my car?  There are already ad-hoc
elevators for cars available on the market to lift similar weights into
the trunk.
Is the MarioWay allowed on public
spaces such as roads, sidewalks, malls? Depending on the geography and state, similar two-wheels
balanced electric devices are allowed in the majority of public spaces.
Can I buy parts?  It will be possible to purchase separately the upper mechanical
part, wheels, knee-rests, handles and seats.
What is the maximum user weight allowed on a MarioWay? We estimate that 90 kgs is the
maximum recommended weight.  WAYS YOU CAN HELP

Pour le financement, l’idée retenue est celle d’une
collecte de fonds en ligne (crowdfunding), comme souvent aux États-Unis pour
financer des projets novateurs à forte composante sociale.
Ainsi de la générosité de chacun dépendra le
bien-être de nombre d’hommes et de femmes. 
Toutes les contributions à partir de 1 dollar sont
acceptées.
Pourquoi en dollars ?
Notre collecteur de fonds est américain, mais il est
possible de souscrire aussi via PayPal en toute securité.
Des prix sont prévus en remerciement de chaque
participation  :
- 10 $ = un mail de remerciement 
- 45 $ = la participation à un séminaire web avec
l’équipe MarioWay
- 70 $ = un T-shirt avec le logo de l’entreprise
- 150 $ = un T-shirt et une boucle de ceinture en
aluminium avec le logo MarioWay
-300 $ = le nom du donateur à un MarioWay
- 1 000 $  = le nom du donateur à cinq MarioWay 
- 2 200 $ = des roues de collection produite en Italie avec le moyeu et les rayons obtenus d'un bloc entier d'alluminium et adaptables à n’importe quel SegWay

<p><strong>God Put a Smile Upon My Face</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my Indiegogo page that I have established for the purpose of raising money to pay for reconstructive dental work.  This was a difficult decision for me to create this campaign.  I am not in the habit of asking for help and I can see the other campaigns on this site are for people who need new organs or are fighting cancer.  Not to mention the fact that it is rather embarrassing to let people see what I look like in “real life” without my teeth.  It was only after much prayer and meditation that I felt Spirit move me to be brave enough to let people know I needed help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This campaign was set up for me to raise the funds needed to have a non-metallic, organic materials bridge permanently fixed to my remaining teeth by my dentist here in Berlin.  Since arriving to Germany, my “source” of income was unexpectedly cut-off.  (The quotations are there to remind myself that God is my Source.  My income was a severance package that I had been receiving from my former employer in bi-weekly installments.  Unbenounced to me, being abroad disqualified me from future payments.)</p>
<p>For the past several years, I have been wearing a temporary, partial denture in my mouth to hide the fact that I am missing my front teeth.  Even with the insurances from past employers, I’ve never been able to afford getting my teeth permanently repaired.  The reason I have chosen now to get the work is because I ran across a wonderful dentist in Berlin who can actually complete the bridgework without using harmful metals in my mouth and he is has a spiritual approach to dentistry.</p>
<p>I need $7,000 because the procedure, along with removing my metal fillings and general cleaning, costs approximately €5,000 (Euros) and this accounts for the lower value of the American Dollar.</p>
<p>With your help, I will for the first time in over 30 years be able to have a healthy, beautiful smile.  I call this campaign “God Put a Smile Upon My Face”.  This is not because of the prospect of getting new teeth, but because in spite of having poor teeth, God has always put a smile on my face.  In fact, I smile almost all the time.  Once in New York someone asked me why I smile all the time.  I simply replied, “Because I can.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How I Lost My Teeth</strong></p>
<p>During the winter of ‘79 I was 10 years old, in the 5th grade, and gearing up for the break over the holidays.  On the last day of school we had to play kickball indoors.  When I was up to kick, I lined a single between 2nd and 3rd base.  Being the competitor that I am, I decided to slide headlong into first base.  By the way, this is a bad idea on a hardwood floor in a gymnasium.  My head bounced off the court face first with a bone-chilling CRUNCH!!  Through my daze, I looked down to see four large pieces of tooth matter on the floor.  My two front teeth had broken completely out of my skull and were each broken in half.  I went into shock as the blood started to flow freely form my bewildered face.  On the way to the nurse’s office, I remember Junior Saul gawking at me; pointing, and yelling, “Cool man!  Gene Simmons!!”  Gene Simmons, as some of you know, is the lead singer of KiSS who used to spit blood during their performances.  Remember, this was 1979! </p>
<p>Since then, my smile has been such a source of pain and embarrassment for me.  Even though my partial <em>temporary</em> “flipper” worked fairly well cosmetically, It being in my mouth for 16 years is causing my other teeth to decay prematurely.</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Thank You</strong><br/><p>Anything you can spare to give is greatly appreciated.  I have faith that there is a way for me to pay for this dental procedure.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart for understanding how difficult it is for me to even put myself “out there” like this.  God bless and Namaste. </p>

This course is the highest accreditation for doulas in Australia and comes highly recommended.<br/><br/> The word Doula is an ancient Greek word meaning 'womans helper', and a Doula's role is to support the mother emotionally and physically through the pains and fears of childbirth, whilst also having a wide knowledge of different supportive birth positions and massages. Up until 100 years ago when birth became clinical and hospitalised in very male environments, majority of all birthing mothers would have been surrounded by female members of her family and community offering their support and wisdom before, during and after birth. There has been a lot of research that has shown that births are calmer, more positive and happier experiences when the woman is supported emotionally and physically by a female birthing partner/attendant. <br/><br/> When I was 12 I witnessed my mother labour at home with my beautiful sister Mialani. She was attended by two independent midwives, and birthed my sister at home in my parents bed. When I was 16 and 20 I witnessed the full labour and birth of my two youngest sisters Freya and Miyuki, both home births with independent midwives and both water births. Experiencing 3 births before I hit 21 I was amazed by the miracle of birth and how empowering this experience can be for women when they are in a relaxed and supportive environment. Since then I have got more and more intruiged by the mysteries and magic of birth and pregnancy, researching stories of people's different labour experiences, the different possibilities available to women during birth in the 21st century, and found out so much information about the importance of a empowering birth experience for women in the bonding with their child but also in how they relate with themselves and their own bodies. <br/><br/> Over the last couple of years I have been hearing more and more about Doula's and have even had some close friends complete their training and become active Birth Attendants. Becoming a Doula to me is an opportunity to learn and experience the magic of birth and nature in a whole new way. It is also an amazing opportunity to support women and their partners in the most phenominal way, and help empower people to see what they are capable of and how incredible humans are. I can see clearly that I would make a fantastic Doula and that I have such a drive to support people in this way.<br/><br/> I have done a lot of reseach into the best courses and have come across a fantastic 20wk course in my home town of Melbourne, Australia which comes highly recommended and is the highest accreditation for Doulas in Australia. At the end of the 20 weeks I would hold a Certificate IV in Doula Support Services which would cover me to work as a Pregnancy, Birth and Post Natal Doula. The course is held twice yearly and costs a wopping $5000. I would LOVE to be able to take part in this course and if any one would like to support me in making this a reality then please feel free to contribute through my IndieGoGo Campaign Fundraiser that I am currently setting up! (I will link as soon as it is complete). I am looking to raise $6500 which will cover the costs of the course as well as allow me some financial support to help cover some of the days that I will not be able to work in my usual job as a Nanny/Childcarer.

<p>First of all some about me. I am a 25 year old mother of two, an 18 month old and an 8 week old. My first pregnancy I had no major complications and everything went smoothly. However, my second, I was not so fortunate. I had complications during the last 2 months of my pregnancy. My son was born 6 weeks early and now suffers from heart and lung problems. He is on a monitor that runs about 348 dollars a month not including the 'leads' (the things that stick to his skin, that he constantly ripping off) and they cost 60 dollars per pack. He also has to see a pediatric cardiologist and a pediatric pulmonologist, again, no insurance. To make matters worse, I went to my six week check up to go back to work full time and was given some devastating news. While she was examining me she noticed my neck/throat looked swollen. She felt around and said that it was my thyroid as well as my lymph nodes. After some blood work she determined that I needed to go see an oncologist and have some biopsies done. Bottom line there is a 95 percent chance that I have cancer. </p>
<p>Although I am facing my own medical problems, I must put my child first and I must deal with his. All my life I have wanted nothing more than to be a good mother and give my kids nothing but the best. How? I have no family to turn to and no one else to ask for help. </p>
<p>Not only has it been my dream to give my kids all I could and everything that I never had, I always wanted to help other people. Now I just have this feeling like I can't even help myself or my sons with all of the medical bills mounting.</p>
<p>There are people who ask for money because they are 'broke', I mean in this economy who isn't. Truthfully though, we see campaigns every day for things like advancing technology, etc and people all over the word are donating thousands, if not millions for technology among other things. All I am asking is for a little bit of help and I pray to God that there are still some genuinely nice people out there! I sit here in tears and beg you to help so I don't have to leave this world with piles of medical bills and my sons not being taken care of. I appreciate the time you have taken to read my story.

<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Turning the tide...</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">People going online to explore the health benefits of marijuana will often stop short because they feel uneasy.  They give up too soon because they're constantly bombarded with confusing lingo and inappropriate material.  Sadly, this deters many people from a health resource that could greatly improve their quality of life.  </span> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Hopegrown.org is a website built for the people who need it the most -- people battling a chronic illness who have run out of options, professionals who are concerned about their privacy and older patients who have difficulty navigating the internet.  These are the kinds of people who go online to find answers to simple questions and deserve to do so without being made to feel like a criminal. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">At Hopegrown.org, patients can find a doctor or marijuana provider near them they can <strong>trust</strong>. Hopegrown’s standards of being <strong>Safe</strong>, <strong>Clean</strong>, <strong>Welcoming</strong> &amp; <strong>Knowledgable</strong> ensure that the businesses listed on our network are the kinds of places....well, you’d send your mom to.  </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>It started with a ripple...</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Hopegrown began in the living rooms of Pete and Peter, buddies and neighbors at a small apartment complex near Universal Studios.  When they first met, the two friends were both new to medical marijuana and they would often trade stories about their experiences as first-time patients.  They discovered that they were often encountering the same problems and asking the same kinds of questions. Like, why is going online to find a legal marijuana resource so unsettling?  Is no one out there developing standards to separate the good guys from the bad?</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">When Pete and Peter started asking some of these questions out loud, they found that a lot of other people were asking them too.  For Pete and Peter, one thing was clear: the status quo wasn't working.  It was time for a change.  It was time to start Hopegrown.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Hopegrown grew quickly as Pete &amp; Peter didn't have to work hard to convince their wives, some friends and family, some lawyers, some doctors, some teachers, some activists and few complete strangers that this idea was worth investing time and money into.  </span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">The next two years were then spent doing research, building the perfect team and setting up a sound infrastructure.  Meanwhile, the two buds were traveling up and down California and meeting with patients and industry professionals so that they could develop the most complete and easy-to-use website possible. All of this while barely holding down their day jobs.</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Making waves...</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p4""><span class=""s1"">We are so close to the finish line and we're confident we can cross it with your help.  Your generous donation will help us to afford things like </span>cameras and editing equipment for our how-to videos, travel and payroll expenses for our street teams, marketing and curriculum materials for training and publicity ... and much, much more.</p>
<p class=""p4"">Once we launch, Hopegrown will be able to sustain its operations from the monthly subscriptions of the businesses that make up our Hopegrown Network.</p>
<p class=""p4""><span class=""s1"">If money is tight for you, like we know it is for so many, you can still make a difference by sharing us with your family and friends.  Pass the video on.  Like us on Facebook.  Follow us on Twitter.  Spread the word! </span></p>
<p class=""p4""><span class=""s1"">By supporting Hopegrown, you’re not just helping a small company get its feet off the ground, you’re giving momentum to a movement.  You’re bringing to life a website that will make a huge impact on the lives of thousands of people who are out of options and desperate for relief.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  We look forward to serving you and your community...</span></p>

</div></div>","Turning the tide...
People going online to explore the health benefits of marijuana will often stop short because they feel uneasy.  They give up too soon because they're constantly bombarded with confusing lingo and inappropriate material.  Sadly, this deters many people from a health resource that could greatly improve their quality of life.   
Hopegrown.org is a website built for the people who need it the most -- people battling a chronic illness who have run out of options, professionals who are concerned about their privacy and older patients who have difficulty navigating the internet.  These are the kinds of people who go online to find answers to simple questions and deserve to do so without being made to feel like a criminal. 
At Hopegrown.org, patients can find a doctor or marijuana provider near them they can trust. Hopegrown’s standards of being Safe, Clean, Welcoming & Knowledgable ensure that the businesses listed on our network are the kinds of places....well, you’d send your mom to.  
It started with a ripple...
Hopegrown began in the living rooms of Pete and Peter, buddies and neighbors at a small apartment complex near Universal Studios.  When they first met, the two friends were both new to medical marijuana and they would often trade stories about their experiences as first-time patients.  They discovered that they were often encountering the same problems and asking the same kinds of questions. Like, why is going online to find a legal marijuana resource so unsettling?  Is no one out there developing standards to separate the good guys from the bad?
When Pete and Peter started asking some of these questions out loud, they found that a lot of other people were asking them too.  For Pete and Peter, one thing was clear: the status quo wasn't working.  It was time for a change.  It was time to start Hopegrown.
Hopegrown grew quickly as Pete & Peter didn't have to work hard to convince their wives, some friends and family, some lawyers, some doctors, some teachers, some activists and few complete strangers that this idea was worth investing time and money into.  
The next two years were then spent doing research, building the perfect team and setting up a sound infrastructure.  Meanwhile, the two buds were traveling up and down California and meeting with patients and industry professionals so that they could develop the most complete and easy-to-use website possible. All of this while barely holding down their day jobs.
Making waves...
We are so close to the finish line and we're confident we can cross it with your help.  Your generous donation will help us to afford things like cameras and editing equipment for our how-to videos, travel and payroll expenses for our street teams, marketing and curriculum materials for training and publicity ... and much, much more.
Once we launch, Hopegrown will be able to sustain its operations from the monthly subscriptions of the businesses that make up our Hopegrown Network.
If money is tight for you, like we know it is for so many, you can still make a difference by sharing us with your family and friends.  Pass the video on.  Like us on Facebook.  Follow us on Twitter.  Spread the word! 
By supporting Hopegrown, you’re not just helping a small company get its feet off the ground, you’re giving momentum to a movement.  You’re bringing to life a website that will make a huge impact on the lives of thousands of people who are out of options and desperate for relief.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  We look forward to serving you and your community...

<h3>Hey guys, this fundraiser is for our friend Dante Cassius, who works for a San Francisco nonprofit. He's raised over $300,000 for humanitarian and environmental causes, but now needs assistance himself as he's severely ill and can barely function. </h3>
<p>Many of us have helped him out ourselves financially as much as we can afford, but now it's time to reach out to the larger community. </p>
<p>He's currently unable to work due to his illness, and his family cannot help him much as they're poor themselves. </p>
<p>Free clinics in San Francisco have told Dante he needs to see a neurologist, but the soonest available appointment is in March. And he's been to the emergency room several times, but they only are able to treat those whose situations are immediately life-threatening (i.e. heart attacks, gunshot wounds). </p>
<p>Dante's one of the most driven, determined, energetic people we know and he's only in his mid twenties, so this is very unusual for him. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>We're looking for resources to help pay Dante's bills (phone, food etc) while he's waiting for a diagnosis, getting treatment and recuperating. Also for him to get a proper diagnosis as soon as possible. He would most likely qualify for Medicare so we're looking into the procedures for that also. </p>
<p>Any and all cash raised will go directly to help him - and we'll let you know more specifics of how much this is going to cost when we know them. </p>
<p>Many of us work in the publicity, communications and nonprofit fields - so we're offering our services in exchange for contributions. I'm personally a literary publicist and have worked as a science/tech and a human interest journalist. So I will write and edit resumes and cover letters, create press releases, write and edit any documents, and/or solicit blog reviews and publicity for your book, film, music, etc. </p>

<h2 class=""short-blurb"">Control Your Dreams! Live Your Fantasies! Go On Nightly Adventures......with iCeption!</h2>
<p>The iCeption <strong>Lucid Dream Controller</strong> not only lets your mind know you are dreaming while you sleep, causing lucidity, but also plays soft, personalized messages or dream scenarios the user creates to guide and influence the destination of the dream.</p>
<p>We wanted to find a way to not only let the dreamer know they are dreaming, but also take command of their dreams.  So many times, lucidity can be reached, but the subconscious mind can often control and manipulate the dream.  iCeption was created to guide or point the dream in the direction the user wants it to go.</p>
<p>First of all, these messages and dream scenarios had to be quite, so to <strong>NEVER</strong> disturb the sleeper.  In fact, without absolute silence, it is almost impossible to hear the iCeption dream scenarios, insuring the dreamer is never woken. What makes iCeption customizable and personalized, is that the dream scenarios are created by the user, by choosing a background setting (the location of the dream), and typing into the app what the characters in the dream will say. The artificial voices generated by iCeption speak word-for-word what the user types into the app.  </p>
<p>With a huge library of background settings, and the user with the ability to choose the voices, sex, and accents of the characters and what they say in your dream, there are <strong>LIMITLESS</strong> dream possibilities. You can guide your dream in any direction you desire. <strong>TAKE COMMAND OF YOUR DREAMS!</strong></p>
<p>If you have ever fallen asleep with the television on and whatever was on made its way into your dream, it's the same concept, except that the dream scenarios are personalized where even the characters can call you by name.</p>
<p>The <strong>Sleep Cycle Alarm</strong> also is the <strong>FIRST ALARM EVER</strong> to not only wake you outside of REM Sleep more refreshed and energized, but to a soothing message that the user creates. Choose a calming background setting and type into the app your morning greeting.  The realistic artificial voices wake you gradually and peacefully, outside of REM Sleep, to an uplifting and encouraging message.</p>
<p>Also the <strong>Positive Affirmation</strong> feature allows users to listen to uplifting and encouraging messages, created by the user, calling them by name and addressing their specific issues and goals.  Everyone struggles sometimes.  Positive affirmations can offer a boost of confidence, increase self-esteem, give encouragement to overcome addictions and achieve goals, and even change mentalities and habits. iCeption gives the user the ability to hear, what they need to hear, to better their life.</p>

<h2>LUCID DREAMING CONTROLLER:</h2>
<p>What would it be like to fly every night? Or be stranded on an island paradise? What is you could be rich and famous, or go on a pirate treasure hunt, or travel to the moon. You can when you learn how to<strong> LUCID DREAM</strong>! iCeption can help!</p>
<p>Watch this quick video on how to use the iCeption Lucid Dream Control Feature........</p>
<p><a href=""https://vimeo.com/47346049"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://vimeo.com/47346049</a></p>
<p>Dreams have always fascinated us. They are still a mystery to scientists and everyday people alike. Lucid dreaming can be so realistic and influential, that it can change habits, attitudes, and perception. Much like the movie Inception, an idea, thought, or scenario planted deep into the subconscious mind is powerful. In our search to find a product that could actually command our dreams, we found some products which are able to track sleeping patterns and let you know you have reached lucidity, but nothing that will help you take control of your dreams. That is when the idea for iCeption was born.</p>
<p>iCeption works like this. By downloading the iCeption App for your iPhone, iPad, iPod, or Android Device, and placing the device on your bed, or in the <strong>iCeption Dream Pillow</strong> at night, iCeption will track your vibrations and movements while you sleep, to determine your sleep cycles and when you reach REM Sleep, which is your highest chance of lucid dreaming. The <strong>iCeption Dream Pillow</strong> keeps your device secure, keeping your device from falling off the bed or sliding underneath the sleeper.</p>
<p><img alt=""iCeption Dream Pillow"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/088/036/1321194a18e6430590d7068c423dfe15_large.JPG?1343427152"" src="""" style="""" title=""ICeption Dream Pillow""/></p>
<p><img alt=""iCeption Dream Pillow"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/088/037/067c9dabbb0ecbc29127db9e8db7fad9_large.JPG?1343427181"" src="""" style="""" title=""iCeption Dream Pillow""/></p>
<p><strong>How does tracking the movements you make at night enable iCeption to determine your sleep cycles and moments of REM Sleep?</strong></p>
<p>First off, REM Sleep stands for Rapid Eye Movement. Your brain experiences heightened activity during this time. Some studies have shown that the mind is actually more acceptable to information and capable of learning during REM Sleep than in conscious hours. These are also your hours of most intense and realistic DREAMING!</p>
<p>It is during this stage of REM Sleep that the brain releases a chemical, which makes it difficult to impossible to move your body. This is a nice and even essential safety feature the body has put into place. If not for that chemical, it would be possible for our bodies to act out our dreams in our sleep. That could be very embarrassing and definitely dangerous.</p>
<p>It is by sensing these stages of movement and non-movement that iCeption determines your sleep cycles, through tracking even the slightest movements and vibrations in the bed. When your body becomes motionless for a certain amount of time, you are most likely in REM Sleep. The iCeption technology follows documented sleep cycles and will activate not in your early hours of sleep, but your deepest hours of REM sleep.</p>
<p><strong>HOW CAN I CONTROL MY DREAMS?</strong></p>
<p>By placing your device on your bed, or in the <strong>iCeption Dream Pillow</strong>, iCeption will track your movements, and when you reach REM Sleep, iCeption will activate your phone’s speakers or wireless earphones. Then, iCeption will play a soft but distinct tune called a <strong>DREAMTONE</strong> to let your mind know you are dreaming. The user trains his or her mind to recognize this repeated tune to indicate they are in the dream state. This is when your dream becomes lucid. Then the magic begins.</p>
<p>iCeption will play soft messages to you while you dream….but no prerecorded messages. <strong>YOU</strong> program exactly what you want iCeption to tell you in your sleep...<strong>word for word</strong>. Choose a background setting like a quiet forest, gentle stream, or sounds of the office or city street. This background setting is the location of your dream scenario. Then you choose the characters in your dream, their sex and accents, and then type what you want them to say. Even have the characters call you by your name to make the experience truly <strong>REAL</strong> and more authentic. It's like performing a theatrical play for your mind while you sleep. The sound levels are so low, so to not wake the dreamer, and the computer generated voices are the highest quality and extremely.</p>
<p><strong>We want to make sure your dreams scenarios seem absolutely REAL!</strong> For that reason we use the highest quality voice software and background settings.  Watch this video to hear a sample of the high quality Text-to-Speech Software and background settings.....</p>

<p>If you have ever fallen asleep with the television on, and whatever was going on on the TV somehow trickled into your dream, it is the same concept, but with much, much softer and calming messages, activated while you are deep in REM Sleep so to not wake you up.</p>
<p><img alt=""Lucid Dream Navigation"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/088/043/632bf21d3cd32172607b8a33b02ded5b_large.jpg?1343427286"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h1>SLEEP CYCLE ALARM:</h1>
<p>Introducing the <strong>iCeption Sleep Cycle Alarm</strong>, which is the first alarm not only to wake you outside of your REM Sleep Cycle, waking you more refreshed and energized, but the only alarm to wake you with a personalized and calming message <strong>YOU</strong> create!</p>
<p>Watch this video on the Sleep Cycle Alarm Feature....</p>

<p>This is exciting.  Waking up is the hardest thing for me.  <strong>I love my sleep</strong>.  With iCeption, the experience is a lot more bearable.  Studies have shown that when we are woken outside the REM Sleep Cycle instead of during REM Sleep, we wake much more alert and refreshed. Just think about how that could change your life....waking up....more awake.  Here is what your sleep cycles look like......</p>
<p> </p>

</div>
<div class=""template asset"">
<p>The greatest feature about the <strong>Sleep Cycle Alarm </strong>is that not only will you wake more refreshed, but iCeption is the <strong>FIRST</strong> and <strong>ONLY</strong> alarm that will wake you up to a soothing and personalized message that <strong>YOU</strong> create.  Imagine waking to the soft sounds of a beach and hearing a realistic and confident voice calling you by name and saying.....</p>

<h1><strong>POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS:</strong></h1>
<p>Life is tough.  We all need a little encouragement every now and then. Usually now more than then. </p>
<p>We always let our conscious life effect the way we sleep.  How many sleepless nights have been spent worrying about the future or the upcoming day?</p>
<p><strong>WHY NOT LET OUR UNCONSCIOUS LIFE AFFECT OUR CONSCIOUS LIFE?</strong> Watch this video on the iCeption Positive Affirmations Feature.....</p>

<p>iCeption can send you positive and personalized messages that you create, tailored to your needs and issues.  Say you are trying to lose weight. Imagine listening to this message over and over before you sleep, during your dreams, or when you need a little boost of encouragement.....</p>
<p>""You are strong and in control of your body.  Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.  You are going to lose weight and feel better.  You are going to look better and be healthier.  You are going to resist the foods that will get in the way of your goals. You can do it.""</p>
<p>Especially in positive affirmations, make sure to have the app call you by your name.  The message is more personalized and rings more true to the listener. If you have ever paid more attention to a parent when they call you by your full name instead of just your first name, you know that it carried and still may carry a lot more weight.</p>
<p>This feature of the app really creates positive mentalities and gives the user the ability to constantly be uplifting and encouraging themselves.  <strong>If you are a believer that your attitude and perception on life can actually effect the outcome of your life, you need this feature!</strong></p>

</div></div>","Control Your Dreams! Live Your Fantasies! Go On Nightly Adventures......with iCeption!
The iCeption Lucid Dream Controller not only lets your mind know you are dreaming while you sleep, causing lucidity, but also plays soft, personalized messages or dream scenarios the user creates to guide and influence the destination of the dream.
We wanted to find a way to not only let the dreamer know they are dreaming, but also take command of their dreams.  So many times, lucidity can be reached, but the subconscious mind can often control and manipulate the dream.  iCeption was created to guide or point the dream in the direction the user wants it to go.
First of all, these messages and dream scenarios had to be quite, so to NEVER disturb the sleeper.  In fact, without absolute silence, it is almost impossible to hear the iCeption dream scenarios, insuring the dreamer is never woken. What makes iCeption customizable and personalized, is that the dream scenarios are created by the user, by choosing a background setting (the location of the dream), and typing into the app what the characters in the dream will say. The artificial voices generated by iCeption speak word-for-word what the user types into the app.  
With a huge library of background settings, and the user with the ability to choose the voices, sex, and accents of the characters and what they say in your dream, there are LIMITLESS dream possibilities. You can guide your dream in any direction you desire. TAKE COMMAND OF YOUR DREAMS!
If you have ever fallen asleep with the television on and whatever was on made its way into your dream, it's the same concept, except that the dream scenarios are personalized where even the characters can call you by name.
The Sleep Cycle Alarm also is the FIRST ALARM EVER to not only wake you outside of REM Sleep more refreshed and energized, but to a soothing message that the user creates. Choose a calming background setting and type into the app your morning greeting.  The realistic artificial voices wake you gradually and peacefully, outside of REM Sleep, to an uplifting and encouraging message.
Also the Positive Affirmation feature allows users to listen to uplifting and encouraging messages, created by the user, calling them by name and addressing their specific issues and goals.  Everyone struggles sometimes.  Positive affirmations can offer a boost of confidence, increase self-esteem, give encouragement to overcome addictions and achieve goals, and even change mentalities and habits. iCeption gives the user the ability to hear, what they need to hear, to better their life.

LUCID DREAMING CONTROLLER:
What would it be like to fly every night? Or be stranded on an island paradise? What is you could be rich and famous, or go on a pirate treasure hunt, or travel to the moon. You can when you learn how to LUCID DREAM! iCeption can help!
Watch this quick video on how to use the iCeption Lucid Dream Control Feature........
https://vimeo.com/47346049
Dreams have always fascinated us. They are still a mystery to scientists and everyday people alike. Lucid dreaming can be so realistic and influential, that it can change habits, attitudes, and perception. Much like the movie Inception, an idea, thought, or scenario planted deep into the subconscious mind is powerful. In our search to find a product that could actually command our dreams, we found some products which are able to track sleeping patterns and let you know you have reached lucidity, but nothing that will help you take control of your dreams. That is when the idea for iCeption was born.
iCeption works like this. By downloading the iCeption App for your iPhone, iPad, iPod, or Android Device, and placing the device on your bed, or in the iCeption Dream Pillow at night, iCeption will track your vibrations and movements while you sleep, to determine your sleep cycles and when you reach REM Sleep, which is your highest chance of lucid dreaming. The iCeption Dream Pillow keeps your device secure, keeping your device from falling off the bed or sliding underneath the sleeper.


How does tracking the movements you make at night enable iCeption to determine your sleep cycles and moments of REM Sleep?
First off, REM Sleep stands for Rapid Eye Movement. Your brain experiences heightened activity during this time. Some studies have shown that the mind is actually more acceptable to information and capable of learning during REM Sleep than in conscious hours. These are also your hours of most intense and realistic DREAMING!
It is during this stage of REM Sleep that the brain releases a chemical, which makes it difficult to impossible to move your body. This is a nice and even essential safety feature the body has put into place. If not for that chemical, it would be possible for our bodies to act out our dreams in our sleep. That could be very embarrassing and definitely dangerous.
It is by sensing these stages of movement and non-movement that iCeption determines your sleep cycles, through tracking even the slightest movements and vibrations in the bed. When your body becomes motionless for a certain amount of time, you are most likely in REM Sleep. The iCeption technology follows documented sleep cycles and will activate not in your early hours of sleep, but your deepest hours of REM sleep.
HOW CAN I CONTROL MY DREAMS?
By placing your device on your bed, or in the iCeption Dream Pillow, iCeption will track your movements, and when you reach REM Sleep, iCeption will activate your phone’s speakers or wireless earphones. Then, iCeption will play a soft but distinct tune called a DREAMTONE to let your mind know you are dreaming. The user trains his or her mind to recognize this repeated tune to indicate they are in the dream state. This is when your dream becomes lucid. Then the magic begins.
iCeption will play soft messages to you while you dream….but no prerecorded messages. YOU program exactly what you want iCeption to tell you in your sleep...word for word. Choose a background setting like a quiet forest, gentle stream, or sounds of the office or city street. This background setting is the location of your dream scenario. Then you choose the characters in your dream, their sex and accents, and then type what you want them to say. Even have the characters call you by your name to make the experience truly REAL and more authentic. It's like performing a theatrical play for your mind while you sleep. The sound levels are so low, so to not wake the dreamer, and the computer generated voices are the highest quality and extremely.
We want to make sure your dreams scenarios seem absolutely REAL! For that reason we use the highest quality voice software and background settings.  Watch this video to hear a sample of the high quality Text-to-Speech Software and background settings.....
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soULMqHUcWw&feature=g-upl
If you have ever fallen asleep with the television on, and whatever was going on on the TV somehow trickled into your dream, it is the same concept, but with much, much softer and calming messages, activated while you are deep in REM Sleep so to not wake you up.

SLEEP CYCLE ALARM:
Introducing the iCeption Sleep Cycle Alarm, which is the first alarm not only to wake you outside of your REM Sleep Cycle, waking you more refreshed and energized, but the only alarm to wake you with a personalized and calming message YOU create!
Watch this video on the Sleep Cycle Alarm Feature....
http://vimeo.com/47346120
This is exciting.  Waking up is the hardest thing for me.  I love my sleep.  With iCeption, the experience is a lot more bearable.  Studies have shown that when we are woken outside the REM Sleep Cycle instead of during REM Sleep, we wake much more alert and refreshed. Just think about how that could change your life....waking up....more awake.  Here is what your sleep cycles look like......
 
 


The greatest feature about the Sleep Cycle Alarm is that not only will you wake more refreshed, but iCeption is the FIRST and ONLY alarm that will wake you up to a soothing and personalized message that YOU create.  Imagine waking to the soft sounds of a beach and hearing a realistic and confident voice calling you by name and saying.....
""Good Morning.  Today is Monday.  Today is YOUR day.  You are in complete control of your destiny.  You are going to be positive today.  You are going to be happy and content.  You are going to accomplish everything you need to without stress or aggravation.  Today is YOUR day.""
WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  How much better will your day go if you woke up to something like that?  No more blaring alarms designed to startle and upset you.  What a horrible way to start the day.
Maybe you would like to learn a new quote or bible passage every morning.  Anything uplifting and inspirational will do.  You just type into the app what you want to wake up to.  We LOVE this feature.  If you are not into Lucid Dreaming or Positive Affirmations, get iCeption just for this purpose.  You will LOVE it too:)

WHY NOT LET OUR UNCONSCIOUS LIFE AFFECT OUR CONSCIOUS LIFE? Watch this video on the iCeption Positive Affirmations Feature.....
http://vimeo.com/47346157
iCeption can send you positive and personalized messages that you create, tailored to your needs and issues.  Say you are trying to lose weight. Imagine listening to this message over and over before you sleep, during your dreams, or when you need a little boost of encouragement.....
""You are strong and in control of your body.  Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.  You are going to lose weight and feel better.  You are going to look better and be healthier.  You are going to resist the foods that will get in the way of your goals. You can do it.""
Especially in positive affirmations, make sure to have the app call you by your name.  The message is more personalized and rings more true to the listener. If you have ever paid more attention to a parent when they call you by your full name instead of just your first name, you know that it carried and still may carry a lot more weight.
This feature of the app really creates positive mentalities and gives the user the ability to constantly be uplifting and encouraging themselves.  If you are a believer that your attitude and perception on life can actually effect the outcome of your life, you need this feature!

  Why Me?
</h3>
<p>
  I return to Kenya because I feel moved to do so.
</p>
<p>
  In the winter of 2011 I arrived in Kenya as a <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/hubertfellowship/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CDC-Hubert Global Health Fellow</a>. While on temporary duty in the offices of the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/countries/kenya/where/default.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">United States Centers for Disease Control in Nairobi</a> I fell in love with Shine Academy.
</p>
<p>
  I was so impressed by the dedication of Shine Academy's teachers and the strength of spirit of its pupils, and wanted to support them. But I didn't yet have all the clinical training I needed to help them in the way I thought would do the most good. Prior to arriving in Kenya I worked on international health projects in the USA, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Ecuador. I earned my Master of Public Health (MPH) with a focus on humanitarian assistance from <a href=""http://www.jhsph.edu/academics/degree-programs/master-of-public-health/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Johns Hopkins,</a> and by the summer of 2011 I graduated with my Medical Doctorate (MD) from the <a href=""http://www.familymedicine.vcu.edu/students/preceptorship/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine</a> with a focus on international, inner-city, and rural medicine.
</p>
<p>
  I am now only seven months away from completing my post-graduate medical training in Family and Community Medicine at the University of Arizona. I have delivered almost 50 babies and cared for newborns, school-age children, Baby Boomers, and octogenarians in the delivery room, the clinic, and the intensive care unit. I am thrilled to the have the opportunity to return to Kibera again as a practicing clinician.

<strong>Why is the Shine Academy Important?</strong>

<p>
<strong><em>""The children almost broken by the world become the adults most likely to change it.""</em><br/>
  -Fran Warren-</strong>
</p>
<p>
<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/ImpoverishedChildren"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shine Academy</a> was founded through the <a href=""http://www.impoverishedchildren.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Impoverished Children NGO</a> by Australians Catherine Whiting and Javier Martinez in 2008. The couple has found a home in Kenya ever since. They established Shine Academy in order to provide quality education to children who otherwise would not have access. Each year hundreds of families come out to interview for the school's available slots. The Academy specifically recruits those with HIV/AIDS, orphans, and children suffering from violence.
</p>
<p>
  In order to help kids in such difficult straits succeed, Catherine and Javier provide 2 meals a day at school, counseling services to parents, fight the corrupt practices of local government officials, and have regularly gone searching through this dangerous slum to search for their missing students. In the fall of 2013 Catherine &amp; Javier opened a new rescue home for children and single parents fleeing abusive situations who need a place to sleep in safety.

</h3>
<p>
<a href=""http://www.irinnews.org/Report/62409/KENYA-Kibera-The-Forgotten-Cit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kibera is</a> a place where hundreds of thousands live without running water or functioning latrines, 5 to a room (or more). It is a place where the primary source of electricity is the illegal hook-up a family must run to the nearest main line, resulting in <a href=""http://voiceofkibera.org/reports/?c=43"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">regular horrifying fires</a> throughout the slum. <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2297237.stm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">It is a place</a> where children are routinely sexually assaulted and disappear while government officials are easily bribed to look the other way.

</p>
<p>
  Recent estimates vary on the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the area, but local NGOs estimate that it is higher than the national average, and the number of orphaned children from HIV+ parents living in the slum is an indication that access to antiretroviral medications has historically been inadequate.
</p>
<p>
  Estimates of Kibera's population range widely. Current geospatial mapping indicates that roughly 270,000 people are crowded into the slum, a space <a href=""http://mapkiberaproject.yolasite.com/maps-and-statistics.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""roughly 75% of the area of Manhattan's Central Park""</a>, yet Kibera is a place of children. Close to 50% of those living in the slum are under the age of 15.

<strong><em>*What is Tikkun?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Tikkun</em> is a Hebrew word which can be roughly translated as ""to heal"" or ""to repair"". There are myriad ways to seek tikkun outside of the provision of healthcare or medical supplies. Education itself, the gift of the Shine Academy, is transformative - with the power to mend past wrongs, counter injustice, and pave a path to healing.

  From a waiting list of hundreds, Shine Academy has accepted a new baby class this year, bringing the total number of students in the school from 75 to 110. I am asking for your help to continue one of Shine Academy's most critical programs: full meals every day for all 110 students, ensuring they will have access to the nutrition they need to focus on their studies and become the innovators that will help improve their community.


Please, return to Kibera with me.


  Other Ways You Can Help


  Even $10 can make a huge difference in this campaign. But times are tough for many and you can help in other ways besides monetary donations. Regardless of what you can donate, consider doing the following:



Share the link to this campaign on your Facebook page, on Twitter, or on your web site.
  

Send an email to your friends, family, and colleagues letting them know about the campaign.
  

Learn something about Kibera. There is perhaps no greater force than education to counter poverty and injustice. The links embedded throughout this page can be used as a starting point.
  


  What's with the ""Buzz"" and ""No-Buzz""?


This year every dollar that you spend earns you a vote on whether or not I should shave my head.

        
  (*donate enough $ in favor of the buzz and you can bankrupt my boyfriend!)
   
  



  Why Me?


  I return to Kenya because I feel moved to do so.


  In the winter of 2011 I arrived in Kenya as a CDC-Hubert Global Health Fellow. While on temporary duty in the offices of the United States Centers for Disease Control in Nairobi I fell in love with Shine Academy.


  I was so impressed by the dedication of Shine Academy's teachers and the strength of spirit of its pupils, and wanted to support them. But I didn't yet have all the clinical training I needed to help them in the way I thought would do the most good. Prior to arriving in Kenya I worked on international health projects in the USA, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Ecuador. I earned my Master of Public Health (MPH) with a focus on humanitarian assistance from Johns Hopkins, and by the summer of 2011 I graduated with my Medical Doctorate (MD) from the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine with a focus on international, inner-city, and rural medicine.


  I am now only seven months away from completing my post-graduate medical training in Family and Community Medicine at the University of Arizona. I have delivered almost 50 babies and cared for newborns, school-age children, Baby Boomers, and octogenarians in the delivery room, the clinic, and the intensive care unit. I am thrilled to the have the opportunity to return to Kibera again as a practicing clinician.





Why is the Shine Academy Important?


""The children almost broken by the world become the adults most likely to change it.""
  -Fran Warren-


Shine Academy was founded through the Impoverished Children NGO by Australians Catherine Whiting and Javier Martinez in 2008. The couple has found a home in Kenya ever since. They established Shine Academy in order to provide quality education to children who otherwise would not have access. Each year hundreds of families come out to interview for the school's available slots. The Academy specifically recruits those with HIV/AIDS, orphans, and children suffering from violence.


  In order to help kids in such difficult straits succeed, Catherine and Javier provide 2 meals a day at school, counseling services to parents, fight the corrupt practices of local government officials, and have regularly gone searching through this dangerous slum to search for their missing students. In the fall of 2013 Catherine & Javier opened a new rescue home for children and single parents fleeing abusive situations who need a place to sleep in safety.


                        
  

  Why Kibera?


Kibera is a place where hundreds of thousands live without running water or functioning latrines, 5 to a room (or more). It is a place where the primary source of electricity is the illegal hook-up a family must run to the nearest main line, resulting in regular horrifying fires throughout the slum. It is a place where children are routinely sexually assaulted and disappear while government officials are easily bribed to look the other way.


  Research done by Kenyan physicians and public health officers show that malnutrition is rampant.


  Recent estimates vary on the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the area, but local NGOs estimate that it is higher than the national average, and the number of orphaned children from HIV+ parents living in the slum is an indication that access to antiretroviral medications has historically been inadequate.


  Estimates of Kibera's population range widely. Current geospatial mapping indicates that roughly 270,000 people are crowded into the slum, a space ""roughly 75% of the area of Manhattan's Central Park"", yet Kibera is a place of children. Close to 50% of those living in the slum are under the age of 15.


*What is Tikkun?


Tikkun is a Hebrew word which can be roughly translated as ""to heal"" or ""to repair"". There are myriad ways to seek tikkun outside of the provision of healthcare or medical supplies. Education itself, the gift of the Shine Academy, is transformative - with the power to mend past wrongs, counter injustice, and pave a path to healing.",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>Our Story   </strong>                                                                                 </p>
<p>             Where do I start? I’m sure you have heard it all and seen it all- people writing letters and taking videos about what is happening with their lives; their pains and sorrows, heartaches and problems that have halted their lives.   Out of desperation and not knowing where to turn, we decided to start a fund raising in order to bring hope and light again in our lives, and maybe , just maybe, a smile that willdominate into a lifetime of hope.  I am one of those people who is looking for that smile for my sister.  She was diagnosed with Lyme disease 6 years ago and not knowing she has had it, has made our lives for the past 3 years the hardest imaginable.  Along with the Lyme disease, she has environmental illness which has turned our lives upside down. Environmental illness is difficult to live with.  Individuals who have this are hypersensitive and some like my sister are affected by electricity, magnetic fields, low and high frequencies. This means she can’t be around any chemical smells (perfume, soaps, etc...), anything that works on electricity, electrical wires, transformers, cell phones, computers, motors of any kind and so on. You can imagine how difficult it has been for us.  Apart from that, she is also light sensitive and has been living in the dark for the past 2 ½ years</p>
<p>            We live in the Laurentians, north of Montreal, Canada.  In 2009, from the month of August up until November, we lived in the dark with no electricity to accommodate my sister’s needs.  The doctors said she needed to be away from the elements that make her ill.  That is why we took her in, my husband and I and our two young children of 8 and 4 and a half years of age.  It was very difficult; our children sacrificed so much for their aunt.  We used hot bottles to warm up when autumn came along. Using heaters was out of the question in order to help my sister.  Winter was soon on its way and out of desperation, I contacted her doctor and she said that some people isolated themselves to keep away from the elements that are keeping them sick.</p>
<p>            We then built an 8x12 trailer in the hopes that it could be used to transport her to where she could be safe and bring her to her doctor.  Unfortunately, because we needed to build it a specific way using inert materials that her sensitivities could handle, the trailer ended up weighing too much and wasn’t safe to move.  She lived in the trailer for about 2 years, electricity free, with no bathroom.  She did her waste in glass jars that we emptied daily.  She is connected to our home to heat her trailer through a water heating system.</p>
<p>            Her needs are getting too much for me and my family to handle.  We needed help to build her a safe home but no one had the heart to support us.  My parents took a 125 000.00 mortgage to help her and we are now 50 000.00 in debt because of the special materials that were needed; we went way over budget.  We don’t have the money to pay it and the interest keeps increasing. She lived in her atelier (workshop) next to her house for about 8 months.  She was hospitalized at Notre Dame Hospital in late October 2012, but the doctors didn’t know how to help her.  They have been tossing her from hospital to hospital - three hospitals in four months; as one doctor put it, she is the patient no doctor wants.  We would want to take her to the Environmental Health Centre in Dallas run by Doctor William Rhea who can help her.  However, it is in the US and the province where we live does not recognize my sister’s illness and will not pay for treatments.  Her doctor told us that it can costs up to 10 thousand a week to treat her.  That’s money we don’t have.  Our parents just took out a mortgage to help build her home (which is too new for her to live in), but the off gassing of the materials used are affecting her sensitivities so she cannot live there for much longer. We have run out of time and money to help her.  Her treatments are costly and the government won’t help people in her situation.  I’ve been using my children’s monthly support allowance and I’ve used up all my savings.  We are literally at the end of our rope and holding on but the pressure is getting to me and I’m being torn between my children, husband and sister.  I am only one person and I can only do so much. We are trying to change Quebec’s view on this illness.  I hope you can find it in your heart to help in any way possible so we can help my sister today and others in the future.</p>

<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $130,000. Before Giovanna can go to Texas, she needs to go to another specialized Doctor for strengthening treatments. This can last anywhere from 1 to 2 months. These treatments cost at least $10,000. Giovanna needs a caretaker as well and a place to stay, food, and personal hygiene products. These funds would keep her there for at least 4 months, where she can hopefully overcome her illness. Any contribution would be greatly appreciated! If we do exceed our goal, the rest of the money will be put into a Lyme Disease Foundation for other people going through the same thing as my aunt, and will also be put towards a website for spreading the knowledge and people’s stories on Lyme disease. Her birthday is March 15<sup>th</sup>. Let’s make this a memorable birthday for her by raising enough money to help!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Lyme disease is a relatively new diagnosis in the medical field, even though it has been around for quite some time. Many people are being misdiagnosed, like my aunt, and when they are correctly diagnosed, it is sometimes too late. I don’t want my aunt to be one of those people. I want to raise awareness for Lyme disease, and let people know that it truly does exist, and it does ruin a person’s life. Not only will this help my aunt in overcoming this illness, it will also help raise awareness of this horrible disease and hopefully help others in the process.</p>

</h3>
<p><b><i>An overnight or weekend of:  Peace, solitude and reflection; True relaxation and recuperation, With no interruptions, No daily responsibilities....   Just Ahhh...... Come to the Oasis!</i></b><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>MY BACKGROUND: </b>  <i>Respite Care for Regular People</i> is a service I've wanted to add to my practice for some time.  Hi, I'm LaDonna Macomber, a mental health counselor in Salem, Oregon.  I've owned and run my private practice for 23 years, and overall have been in the counseling profession for 30 years.  It's great work and I love doing it.  Adding Respite care for Regular People will broaden my practice, and help me address this unique need in society.  <i><b>See, below, what your contribution can do to help!</b></i><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Creative Approach:</b>  I have always added more to my work than just counseling and therapy.  When clients experience life transitions and need to re-make themselves, I offer them <i><b>a variety of tools</b></i>, to help them make informed choices about their new directions.  Two of the best of these tools are the Strong Interest Inventory and the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator, both of which I am licensed to provide.  I have offered some of this expertise to contributors, <i><b>in my various thank-you-perks </b></i>outlined on this page.  </li>
<li>
<b>My Credentials:</b> I'm state licensed, nationally certified times 2, and credentialed to provide life coaching services and clinical supervision to other counselors.  I have years of experience running programs, supervising, and managing large projects.  <i>I am well suited to see this project through.</i>  Only funding has stood in the way of doing so in the past.  <i><b>See, below, what your contribution can do to help!</b></i><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>MY CAMPAIGN: </b> Respite Relief will provide respite care services to <i><b>regular people</b></i>, who have <i><b>""hit the wall""</b></i> with too many responsibilities or activities, or who give so much to others that they are exhausted, over-stressed, and <b><i>Just Need A Break.  Help me help them! <br/></i></b>
</li>
<li>
<b><i>Who Benefits from Respite Care? </i></b> Regular, everyday people. Anyone who is burned-out, stressed out, over-booked, or over-worked.  Anyone who does care-giving for a living or for a family member, has experienced a recent loss or trauma.  Anyone who needs a break.  Most of us would say <i><b>we all could use a weekend of respite</b></i> at the end of a stressful week or the completion of a large project.  <br/>
</li>
<li>
<i><b>What Does the Respite Visitor Experience?</b> </i>  Each respite room is a private, personal retreat, simply furnished for rest, relaxation and sleep - meditation, yoga, and journal writing - reading, full-spectrum light therapy, and simple meals with in-room refrigerator and microwave.  No need for the Respite Visitor to leave the room and encounter other people.  <i>Only rest, relaxation, and rejuvenation are on the agenda. </i> After a day or a weekend, the Respite Visitor leaves refreshed and ready to resume daily responsibilities.  <i><b>See below what your contribution can do to help!</b></i><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b><i>I am passionate about this project.</i></b>  There is such a need for regular people who <i><b>endure high stress</b></i> in their lives, of whatever kind, to have the opportunity, and a place to go, to rest and recuperate.  <i><b>Help me provide this service!</b></i><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>WHY THIS CAMPAIGN NOW?</b>  It's the right time.  When my long-time office associate, and dear friend, informed me she'd be retiring as of December 1st, I realized I would be required to transition, as well.  I thought: either I have to size down and move to a smaller office that I can manage on my own, OR, I need to expand and pursue my dream of adding respite care to my therapeutic practice.  <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>For some time, I've wanted to move in this direction</b>, and have taken steps toward this goal, including applying for grants and negotiating on a property.  Until now, the stars have not aligned.  With funds raised by this campaign, all my previous sketches and design plans, mission statements and strategic plans will become more than just fun mini-projects.  I have the energy and vision to get this project done, but previously have lacked enough funds.  <b><i>Your kind support and generous contributions will make this project happen. </i></b>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>WHAT I NEED TO LAUNCH THIS PROJECT:</b>  I set the goal for this campaign at $20,000, because I want to make sure, with our hard work and your help, we can make it there.  I've learned from past experience that I need at least  $20,000 to $30,000 to entice a seller of the right property to carry my contract.  Why do I need this? Salary and wage earners can obtain bank financing based on their total, gross income.  Self employed persons are held to a different standard.  We qualify for bank financing based on our net income, after all expenses are taken out of the total.  This leaves us with a lower income and qualifies us for smaller sums of financing.  The way I can make this project happen is to convince a seller to carry my contract.  $20,0000 to $30,000 would win over a seller. So, for Phase I, $20,000 is the goal. <b><i> </i><i>Again, your contributions, of any amount, add up and will make the all difference in helping make this project a reality.</i></b><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>WHAT YOU GET FOR HELPING:</b>  You gain the good feeling and satisfaction of giving people who are exhausted and over-stressed, the opportunity to take a time-out from their overwhelming daily responsibilities.  <i><b>You help ""Give Them a Break"" with your contribution.  </b><b>See, below, what your contribution of any amount can do.</b></i>   In addition, I will provide updates for you on the progress of the project on the campaign's Updates page and via facebook.  And, of course, I have provided some <i><b>fun and interesting thank-you-perks</b></i> at each level of contribution, which you may want to check out and claim.<br/>

An overnight or weekend of:  Peace, solitude and reflection; True relaxation and recuperation, With no interruptions, No daily responsibilities....   Just Ahhh...... Come to the Oasis!


MY BACKGROUND:   Respite Care for Regular People is a service I've wanted to add to my practice for some time.  Hi, I'm LaDonna Macomber, a mental health counselor in Salem, Oregon.  I've owned and run my private practice for 23 years, and overall have been in the counseling profession for 30 years.  It's great work and I love doing it.  Adding Respite care for Regular People will broaden my practice, and help me address this unique need in society.  See, below, what your contribution can do to help!


Creative Approach:  I have always added more to my work than just counseling and therapy.  When clients experience life transitions and need to re-make themselves, I offer them a variety of tools, to help them make informed choices about their new directions.  Two of the best of these tools are the Strong Interest Inventory and the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator, both of which I am licensed to provide.  I have offered some of this expertise to contributors, in my various thank-you-perks outlined on this page.  

My Credentials: I'm state licensed, nationally certified times 2, and credentialed to provide life coaching services and clinical supervision to other counselors.  I have years of experience running programs, supervising, and managing large projects.  I am well suited to see this project through.  Only funding has stood in the way of doing so in the past.  See, below, what your contribution can do to help!


MY CAMPAIGN:  Respite Relief will provide respite care services to regular people, who have ""hit the wall"" with too many responsibilities or activities, or who give so much to others that they are exhausted, over-stressed, and Just Need A Break.  Help me help them! 


Who Benefits from Respite Care?  Regular, everyday people. Anyone who is burned-out, stressed out, over-booked, or over-worked.  Anyone who does care-giving for a living or for a family member, has experienced a recent loss or trauma.  Anyone who needs a break.  Most of us would say we all could use a weekend of respite at the end of a stressful week or the completion of a large project.  


What Does the Respite Visitor Experience?   Each respite room is a private, personal retreat, simply furnished for rest, relaxation and sleep - meditation, yoga, and journal writing - reading, full-spectrum light therapy, and simple meals with in-room refrigerator and microwave.  No need for the Respite Visitor to leave the room and encounter other people.  Only rest, relaxation, and rejuvenation are on the agenda.  After a day or a weekend, the Respite Visitor leaves refreshed and ready to resume daily responsibilities.  See below what your contribution can do to help!


I am passionate about this project.  There is such a need for regular people who endure high stress in their lives, of whatever kind, to have the opportunity, and a place to go, to rest and recuperate.  Help me provide this service!


WHY THIS CAMPAIGN NOW?  It's the right time.  When my long-time office associate, and dear friend, informed me she'd be retiring as of December 1st, I realized I would be required to transition, as well.  I thought: either I have to size down and move to a smaller office that I can manage on my own, OR, I need to expand and pursue my dream of adding respite care to my therapeutic practice.  


For some time, I've wanted to move in this direction, and have taken steps toward this goal, including applying for grants and negotiating on a property.  Until now, the stars have not aligned.  With funds raised by this campaign, all my previous sketches and design plans, mission statements and strategic plans will become more than just fun mini-projects.  I have the energy and vision to get this project done, but previously have lacked enough funds.  Your kind support and generous contributions will make this project happen. 



What We Need & What You Get



WHAT I NEED TO LAUNCH THIS PROJECT:  I set the goal for this campaign at $20,000, because I want to make sure, with our hard work and your help, we can make it there.  I've learned from past experience that I need at least  $20,000 to $30,000 to entice a seller of the right property to carry my contract.  Why do I need this? Salary and wage earners can obtain bank financing based on their total, gross income.  Self employed persons are held to a different standard.  We qualify for bank financing based on our net income, after all expenses are taken out of the total.  This leaves us with a lower income and qualifies us for smaller sums of financing.  The way I can make this project happen is to convince a seller to carry my contract.  $20,0000 to $30,000 would win over a seller. So, for Phase I, $20,000 is the goal.  Again, your contributions, of any amount, add up and will make the all difference in helping make this project a reality.


WHAT YOU GET FOR HELPING:  You gain the good feeling and satisfaction of giving people who are exhausted and over-stressed, the opportunity to take a time-out from their overwhelming daily responsibilities.  You help ""Give Them a Break"" with your contribution.  See, below, what your contribution of any amount can do.   In addition, I will provide updates for you on the progress of the project on the campaign's Updates page and via facebook.  And, of course, I have provided some fun and interesting thank-you-perks at each level of contribution, which you may want to check out and claim.


WHERE THE FUNDS GO:  Whatever amount this campaign generates will go toward obtaining a suitable facility to house Respite Relief.  If we don't reach our funding goals, I will search for a smaller space with fewer respite rooms.  If we exceed our funding goals, I'll look for a larger facility with more respite rooms.  Your generous contributions will truly make all the difference.  Thank you for your help and support.

WHAT YOUR DONATION MEANS:  Contributions of any size are greatly appreciated!  Donations in the range of: $15 to $49 are equivalent to a weekend of simple, in-room meals for a respite visitor; yoga CD or yoga mat for a respite room; guided meditation, self hypnosis or relaxation CDs; essential oils for relaxation; aroma therapy supplies; a journal for writing; $50 to $99 are equivalent to comfortable bedding for a respite room; in-room microwave for simple meals; black out curtains for a calm environment; sound system for relaxation CDs or calming music; $100 to $299 are equivalent to an in-room refrigerator for a respite room; a therapeutic, full spectrum lamp for light therapy; a free over night stay for a respite visitor; $300 to $500 are equivalent to a small dining set for a respite room; a comfortable bed; three to five free over nights for respite visitors.

<h2 class=""wp-normal-p""><strong>“TELL YOUR BODY WHAT TO DO, DON’T LET YOUR BODY TELL YOU” ~ CHELOMAN</strong></h2>
<p>Hi , My name is Jose Alonzo.  I go by Chelo Man or Chelo for short.  I have been boxing since I was only seven years old, and boxed professionally for a total of 15 years.  Last year I retired from boxing after an injury put me in position were if I got hit the wrong way one more time, I may not recover.</p>
<p>When you have been training to fight, or fighting your whole life, an injury might make most people want to just throw in the towel.  But not me; instead, I have decided to use my knowledge of training, nutrition, and motivation to help people hit their goals.</p>
<p>This is where you come in.  I want us to open a gym like no other you have ever been to.  I actually want to open 300 gyms, but I understand that every race in life starts with just one step.  With your pledge, I can open Chelo Man Fitness 24/7.  My gym will not be like the traditional gym.  Most people don’t realize that some of the most physically fit people in the world were Cave Man, Apache Indians, Gladiators, Mongol Warriors, and Vikings.  These people were intense athletes, and none of them had fancy machines to work out with.   They worked out using natural movements, and are considered some of the best athletes that ever lived.  This is what Chelo Man Fitness is all about.  We will have a 1,800 square foot rock climbing wall to simulate climbing mountains; straight, and inclined monkey bars to simulate climbing in the jungle; pull up bars and dip stations to help with upper body strength; jump boxes to help with lower body conditioning; climbing ropes for your core work out; indoor track for cardiovascular workouts.  We will also have boxing/MMA area to work on striking, kicking, and endurance.  Plus we will have over 3,000 lbs of dumbbells, Olympic, and kettle bells for traditional work outs.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>To start getting people ready for our gym I have been organizing teams, and traning them for Mud Runs.  Below is some members of a team of 82 people who ran in a Mud Run with Team Chelo in July 2013.</p>

<p class=""wp-normal-p""> </p>
<p> I am teaming up with some great people to make this happen.  I have my business partner Jeffrey.  Jeff is a retired US Army Military Policeman and Paratrooper.  He has also has been a finance manager for over 13 years, and his job is to make sure the money is right.  Our gym will be staffed with a professional athlete at all times.  We have a current Florida Swat Officer, and ex VMI star football player who will train people on how to create explosive power in their work outs.  We will have a Registered Nurse, with an emphasis on nutrition.  Her job is to create personalized nutritional programs for all members wanting help.  We will have a certified personal trainer specializing in performance and fat burning exercises.  He is also certified TRX trainer.  TRX uses your body weight and rubber bands to push body conditioning to the limit.  And lastly, we have a MMA fighter, who will teach striking, kicking, and endurance training.  All of our trainers will be certified personal trainers, and have excelled athletically in their profession.  This is important because most gyms hire trainers that are not certified, and this can be very dangerous.</p>
<p>All of our 180 group training classes offered each month will  be free.  You don’t pay your gym dues, and then pay more to have someone help you reach your goals.  All the Boot camps, Yoga, Cross Training, Circuit Training, TRX Classes, Boxing, MMA Classes, Nutrition Classes, Kick Boxing, and Rock Climbing Classes are always FREE!!!</p>
<p>Below Chelo is working with the Wounded Warriors Foundation.  It's about giving back to the community.    <br/></p>

When you have been training to fight, or fighting your whole life, an injury might make most people want to just throw in the towel.  But not me; instead, I have decided to use my knowledge of training, nutrition, and motivation to help people hit their goals.
This is where you come in.  I want us to open a gym like no other you have ever been to.  I actually want to open 300 gyms, but I understand that every race in life starts with just one step.  With your pledge, I can open Chelo Man Fitness 24/7.  My gym will not be like the traditional gym.  Most people don’t realize that some of the most physically fit people in the world were Cave Man, Apache Indians, Gladiators, Mongol Warriors, and Vikings.  These people were intense athletes, and none of them had fancy machines to work out with.   They worked out using natural movements, and are considered some of the best athletes that ever lived.  This is what Chelo Man Fitness is all about.  We will have a 1,800 square foot rock climbing wall to simulate climbing mountains; straight, and inclined monkey bars to simulate climbing in the jungle; pull up bars and dip stations to help with upper body strength; jump boxes to help with lower body conditioning; climbing ropes for your core work out; indoor track for cardiovascular workouts.  We will also have boxing/MMA area to work on striking, kicking, and endurance.  Plus we will have over 3,000 lbs of dumbbells, Olympic, and kettle bells for traditional work outs.

To start getting people ready for our gym I have been organizing teams, and traning them for Mud Runs.  Below is some members of a team of 82 people who ran in a Mud Run with Team Chelo in July 2013.



Below is another team that competed in March of 2013.

 
 I am teaming up with some great people to make this happen.  I have my business partner Jeffrey.  Jeff is a retired US Army Military Policeman and Paratrooper.  He has also has been a finance manager for over 13 years, and his job is to make sure the money is right.  Our gym will be staffed with a professional athlete at all times.  We have a current Florida Swat Officer, and ex VMI star football player who will train people on how to create explosive power in their work outs.  We will have a Registered Nurse, with an emphasis on nutrition.  Her job is to create personalized nutritional programs for all members wanting help.  We will have a certified personal trainer specializing in performance and fat burning exercises.  He is also certified TRX trainer.  TRX uses your body weight and rubber bands to push body conditioning to the limit.  And lastly, we have a MMA fighter, who will teach striking, kicking, and endurance training.  All of our trainers will be certified personal trainers, and have excelled athletically in their profession.  This is important because most gyms hire trainers that are not certified, and this can be very dangerous.
All of our 180 group training classes offered each month will  be free.  You don’t pay your gym dues, and then pay more to have someone help you reach your goals.  All the Boot camps, Yoga, Cross Training, Circuit Training, TRX Classes, Boxing, MMA Classes, Nutrition Classes, Kick Boxing, and Rock Climbing Classes are always FREE!!!
Below Chelo is working with the Wounded Warriors Foundation.  It's about giving back to the community.    

 
We have broken down where the money that we raise will be going to...
Projected costs for build out and operating expenses for 6,600 square foot facility:
Rent (Start up): $16,500
Flooring/ Indoor Track with install: $20,500
Rope Climbing (3) stations: $275
Weight- Olympic, Bar Bells, & Kettle Bells: $12,400
Benches (12) Adjustable: $2,990
             (6) Flat: $995

44 Ft of Stag Racking (Pull up/ Squat): $6,995
Monkey Bars (3 sets): $1,495
Dip Stations (6): $599
Pylo Boxes (6): $599
Sledge Hammer Station (4): $599
Boxing/ MMA Stations (6): $2,394
Rock Climbing Wall 1,600 Sq Ft: $10,500
Paint, and Build Out: $1,995
Sign/ Advertising: $5,995
Insurance: $5,000
Misc (Because you always overlook stuff): $4,995
Total: $93,716
I know the gym will cost more than what we are trying to collect.  But my business partner Jeffrey, and I, have been saving and are covering the rest.  This is a dream that can come true with just a little help from the community. Here are some of the perks you will receive.... 

 A 45 day supply of Chelo Man Multi-Vitamin Energy Complex.  Give yourself energy, while taking all the vitamins your body needs daily to be a champ.

Chelo wearing one of the free One of a Kind shirts donated by Jeffrey '69 Clothing to help Chelo reach his goal.

Some members of ""Team Chelo"" wearing the t-shirt we will be giving as a perk if you donate $50 or more.  The t-shirt will be a different color to commemorate this crowd funding event.This is it...  Hopefully you have learned a little bit more about me and what I stand for.  I have had many set backs in life.  But I have excelled from every challenge put in front of me.  Please help me make my dream of Chelo Man Fitness become a reality.  Thanks for taking the time to hear my story.Chelo and his family.Boom! You Can and You Will!!!",10.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Poverty Level and up to 115,140 uninsured at this time in the County.  For

<p>To this point, our classes have been held in a less than ideal shared studio space with less than dependable equipment-- but we have never been deterred from the mission. Our #SpikedSquad shows up for us and reminds us that Spiked Spin is a critical element in reshaping the wellness landscape. We're proud of all that we've been able to accomplish, and we are confident that our flagship location will allow us to make an even greater impact! </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Our current space is currently under construction and therefore our launch date is in flux for fall 2019. We are aware that the overall cost of a project of this magnitude is significantly above our Indiegogo target, however, we're hoping that this fundraiser will get us up and running to  service our community.</p>
