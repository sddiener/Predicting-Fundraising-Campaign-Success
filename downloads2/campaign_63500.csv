<p></p>
<p>My name is Jose from L.E.S., New York City. I am 1 brother of 10 siblings
(obviously there wasn't a television available for my parents in the 80's). In
my youth I’ve been the best at everything; poetry &amp; rhyme, school,
basketball, talking to the ladies, cooking a mean Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese and
being the family’s comedian. </p>
<p>Unfortunately I could be the best for long.
Since 2006, I have been suffering with Parkinson's disease (PD) and the
symptoms have worsened throughout the years. What does that mean? No more school;
no more sports; no more ladies &amp; no more home-cooked Mac &amp; Cheese.
 </p>
<p>Prior to my PD, I was a student at Borough of Manhattan
Community College and employed at two jobs. Since then, I've lost employment
and have not been able to continue my studies at
school due to PD. I've been afraid to travel alone
since an incident a few years back where I fell at a restaurant and
could not get up without help. I was 28 years old. I want my life back! </p>
<p>I’m starting a campaign to raise awareness of PD and also to help me cover
the cost for Microdose Therapy. Microdose Therapy can help me reduce my
symptoms of PD. I would do anything to be able to stop my tremors, to sit down
without assistance and to get up without thinking, “If I fall down I’ll have to
wait until someone comes home from work to pick me up.” And that has happened
before.  </p>
<p>Your help can fund the cost of Microdose Therapy, for
which I will be forever grateful. </p>
<p>The Deal: Microdose Therapy costs $7,500. It is 7 weeks of intensive tests,
therapy and education. After that, it’s $100 annually which I think I can try
to pay for myself. </p>
<p>Where do the funds go if I don’t reach my goal? This isn’t an option for me.
I will continue to save up until I can completely pay for it, even if it takes
me years (which I hope is not the case).  </p>
<p>What if you don’t have the dough? I’m happy to at least get some advice on
how I can control PD for the time being until I can afford Microdose Therapy. </p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my message. Your help is extremely
appreciated. </p>
<p>FYI - It took me 5 days to write this message. I’m cramping up… BRB.</p>

<br/><br/>
                As a professional Biomagnetic researcher familiar with how magnetic fields affect people’s health, I am appalled about how few people know about the 
                dangers of EMF. </font></p>
<p align=""justify""><font style=""font-size: 13.5pt;"">It’s a basic law of physics that all our electrically-run technologies put 
                out EMF which goes through and pervades our bodies. </font></p>
<p align=""justify""><font style=""font-size: 13.5pt;"">As the magnetic fields pass through our body, they affect the electrons of the 
                atoms which in complex arrangements, make up all the molecules and cells of our 
                body. <br/></font></p>

                recently, an acquaintance who used a laptop continuously on her lap for several

                cancer and died sometime thereafter. She was unaware of the high EMF coming from

<p align=""justify""><font style=""font-size: 13.5pt;"">These devices were invented to neutralize EMF, but they cannot stop the EMF from affecting the body’s cells and as one scientific group 
                who tested these devices so plainly put it: <b>“they don’t work.”</b>
<br/><br/><font color=""#FF0000"" style=""font-size: 18pt; font-weight: 700;"">The EMF Solution </font>
<br/><br/>
                BiomagScience has worked with individuals who had EMF health issues. In each case their 
                cellular energy (voltage measurements) and overall vitality was extremely low 
                and as a result, they were very ill. <br/></font></p>
<p align=""justify""><font style=""font-size: 13.5pt;"">We worked with a middle-aged flight attendant 
                who had migraines, a constant cold and chronic fatigue from EMF. The woman 
                explained that constant sickness is common in her profession. I wasn’t surprised 
                because when measured, the EMF in a plane was extremely high – literally a flying 
                EMF oven – no wonder so many flying professionals don’t live long lives.
                <br/><br/>
                We have also helped several people who were so Electro-Sensitive that they had 
                to move to an electric-free house to get relief from the nausea, fatigue and 
                illness from the EMF of the refrigerator, heater fan, washing machine, etc. 
                These individuals suffered from very low vitality. </font></p>

<br/><br/><p align=""justify"">
<font style=""font-size: 13.5pt;"">In 
                each of the EMF cases, simple Biomagnetic therapy (good magnetic fields) were 
                used on key energizing points to rebuild their cellular energy. At one point, 
                their vitality/voltage increased enough to overcome their sensitivity to the EMF and 
                resolve their medical conditions. </font></p>
<p align=""justify""><font style=""font-size: 13.5pt;"">The stewardess got rid of her constant cold, 
                migraines, and chronic fatigue and the Electro-Sensitive individuals were able

<p align=""center"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">
<font style=""font-size: 13.5pt;"">
<font color=""#FF0000"">Good health is based on high cellular

Dangerous, Insidious EMF(electromagnetic fields)
                


                We live in an amazing age of technology where world class communication, 
                information, and entertainment are at our fingertips with a click of a button or 
                a swipe of the screen. 
However, along with this marvelous technology comes a 
                very subtle, dangerous problem: Electromagnetic Fields (EMF). 
Science shows that the following devices put out dangerous EMF:



Cordless and cell phones


Computer tablets


Laptops


Clock radios


Wi-fi


Microwaves


Everything 
                electric creates EMF, some more than others. 


The danger is EMF energy is constantly pervading our bodies and over a period 
                of time, can disrupt our cells and harm our health resulting in a number of 
                serious medical conditions. 

What can we do to protect ourselves?

                My name is Peter Kulish. I am the Founder and principal researcher/developer of
               BiomagScience, 
                its advanced therapies and author of “Conquering Pain, The Art of Healing with Biomagnetism,” the therapy manual for over 170 medical conditions. 
                BiomagScience Therapies are used by individuals, caregivers, practitioners, and 
                clinics worldwide to increase vitality, provide pain relief and help resolve 
                acute conditions and chronic illness.
                The Problem 

                As a professional Biomagnetic researcher familiar with how magnetic fields affect people’s health, I am appalled about how few people know about the 
                dangers of EMF. 
It’s a basic law of physics that all our electrically-run technologies put 
                out EMF which goes through and pervades our bodies. 
As the magnetic fields pass through our body, they affect the electrons of the 
                atoms which in complex arrangements, make up all the molecules and cells of our 
                body. 
Good magnetic fields, like BiomagScience therapy, provide an amplified 
                form of the body’s natural energy which increases and supports cellular health.
                
With all the worldwide research about EMF producing:



nausea 


depression


dementia


tumors


cancer and other conditions



It is surprising how 
                few people know about the dangers of EMF. 
                
Bad magnetic fields like the pulsing EMF from our cell phones, computers, wifi, 
                or electrical devices disrupt the cellular electrons and over a period of time, 
                weaken the cells and our health. 
EMF cellular deterioration can cause fatigue, nausea, 
                depression, illness, and in some cases, premature death. 
Just 
                recently, an acquaintance who used a laptop continuously on her lap for several 
                months while she sat with her father in hospice, developed aggressive colon 
                cancer and died sometime thereafter. She was unaware of the high EMF coming from 
                the laptop and unfortunately was not aware of how she could have protected 
                herself.
                The False Answer 

                To date, the following types of EMF protection devices are available:



pendants


braclets


stick-on devices


plug-in devices



These devices were invented to neutralize EMF, but they cannot stop the EMF from affecting the body’s cells and as one scientific group 
                who tested these devices so plainly put it: “they don’t work.”
The EMF Solution 

                BiomagScience has worked with individuals who had EMF health issues. In each case their 
                cellular energy (voltage measurements) and overall vitality was extremely low 
                and as a result, they were very ill. 
We worked with a middle-aged flight attendant 
                who had migraines, a constant cold and chronic fatigue from EMF. The woman 
                explained that constant sickness is common in her profession. I wasn’t surprised 
                because when measured, the EMF in a plane was extremely high – literally a flying 
                EMF oven – no wonder so many flying professionals don’t live long lives.
                
                We have also helped several people who were so Electro-Sensitive that they had 
                to move to an electric-free house to get relief from the nausea, fatigue and 
                illness from the EMF of the refrigerator, heater fan, washing machine, etc. 
                These individuals suffered from very low vitality. 

Microscopic picture of typically low-energy, sick blood cells clustered together 
                in Rouleau pattern from EMF, illness, or diet. 
This condition produces very poor 
                nutritional delivery to the cells and incomplete detoxification of the cells. 



Within 40 minutes of BiomagScience Daytime therapy, the Rouleau pattern, 
                low-vitality blood cells became charged into their single, healthy placement 
                that efficiently delivers nutrition and efficiently detoxifies.
The Answer 

In 
                each of the EMF cases, simple Biomagnetic therapy (good magnetic fields) were 
                used on key energizing points to rebuild their cellular energy. At one point, 
                their vitality/voltage increased enough to overcome their sensitivity to the EMF and 
                resolve their medical conditions. 
The stewardess got rid of her constant cold, 
                migraines, and chronic fatigue and the Electro-Sensitive individuals were able 
                to move back to their homes and live normally.


Good health is based on high cellular 
                    vitality which provides 
                    efficient metabolism of nutrition and detoxification.


                    BiomagScience has proven over and over again, that simple, daily 
                Biomagnetic energy supplementation helps maintain high cellular energy and 
                wellness.
BiomagScience advanced therapies have produced miracle-like results in 
                helping resolve extremely acute and chronic medical conditions – many unknown to BiomagScience may very well have occurred from long-term EMF 
                exposure.

Case Study



     Bedridden for 25 years from malabsorption starts to heal in 
                an hour of magnet therapy 



                            The following case shows the results of BiomagScience 
                therapy on someone who very ill from low cellular vitality. The condition and 
                results of this case is exactly the same as the EMF electro-sensitive people 
                whose cellular vitality is very low.
In 1980, the subject, a middle-aged woman, 
                developed malabsorption from chemical poisoning which restricted her cells 
                ability to absorb micro-nutrients or detoxify and as a result, she developed 
                fibromyalgia, CFS and immense pain standing. Her cells (below) registered very 
                low vitality/voltage.  Many allopathic and alternative therapies including 
                improper biomagnetic therapy (Nikken) were tried; but because 
                    her body was so 
                weak from malabsorption, the woman was chronically ill and bedridden for 25 
                years.  With a customized nutritional program for 3 years, the 
                    cell’s membrane energy (parallel capacitance) could only increase 
                    25pF (pico Farads) and then continued to remain stuck and would not 
                    progress any further until BiomagScience therapy was 
                    initiated.
Normal healthy cell membranes have a membrane capacitance of 
                    750-850pF. That is the amount of energy a healthy person has to pull in nutrients and push out toxins. The woman's last two tests before BiomagScience therapy were on Nov 18, 2004 and seven months later on June 14, 
                    2005. Both tests measured 400pF 
                    - typical of her chronically ill fixed pattern through the years.
Right after her voltage testing on June 14, 2005, 
                    BiomagScience therapy was applied and within an 
                    hour, her capacitance increased
                    107pF to
                    507pF - an energy increase which immediately unstuck the 25-year condition and resolved the

After a month of 
                BiomagScience therapy, her pain was eliminated and her energy increased so much, 
                she was able to resume her profession of singing and song writing. Within a 
                year, she was playing competitive tennis.
Conclusion: A classic case of 
                malabsorption - the cells did not have enough energy to absorb the required 
                micro-nutrients needed to create more energy – literally stuck with no hope 
                until BiomagScience therapy charged the cells helping overcome the low energy 
                and setting the woman onto the road to recovery.

 The 
                Proposal 

BiomagScience needs $80,000 to formalize a before and after clinical 
                study through licensed medical practitioners to test BiomagScience therapies on 
                EMF electro-sensitive patients and long-term, chronically ill patients. Proceeds will be used to acquire individuals for tests cases under
primary medical review, acquiring Bio-cellular Impedance Analysis (cellular
voltage) instrumentation, before and after blood panels, microscopy for blood
and tissue analysis, and finalization of clinical study.
The ResultsThe BiomagScience study will be published to notify the 
                public about the EMF problem and that the simple, preventative method of 
                energizing the body not only defends against EMF, but it fully supports a return 
                to good health and wellness for those who are ill. 
                    




                    The study will show how 
                BiomagScience therapies provide the support to overcome and help resolve a 
                multitude of chronic conditions - important information to everyone everywhere. 

Thank you for your help. BiomagScience has been on a mission to help people. We 
                have developed advanced therapies that have brought people out of terminating 
                comas, regenerated severed nerves, helped increase healing 4-6 times faster, 
                regenerated herniated discs to full height, help overcome genetic problems. 
Your 
                help with this study will help generate the truth and consciousness of what 
                advanced, simple magnetic therapy has achieved when used correctly. It is an 
                important science for everyone to use to be healthy and live longer.Best of

<p><b><em></em></b><em><i></i></em><em>FeenPhone sounds much better than</em><em><i> Skype, Mumble, TeamSpeak, Blink, <span><span>Ventrilo, </span></span>Google Hangouts, </i></em>mobile phones or landlines.<br/>
<i><em><br/>
<i>FeenPhone is no-cost software</i></em></i> that opens up a global 
world of possibilities for real-time high-quality voice media 
production, or simply conversation, over any distance.<br/>
<br/>
<em><i>Before FeenPhone, there has never been a way to do ultra-high-quality full-duplex talk communication in real time for free</i>.</em> FeenPhone does all this, and you can start using it today.</p>
<p>But we have a lot of round-two improvements we'll need to make to revolutionize no-cost high-quality real-time spoken audio over the Internet. </p>
</div> <div> <p></p>
<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://feenphone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/FeenWide.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p>
<h3>
</h3>
<h3>Why not just use Existing programs?</h3>
<p>FeenPhone is superior to<em><i> </i></em>other voice-over-Internet programs or mobile phones in audio quality. FeenPhone sounds crystal clear compared 
to all these programs / platforms.<br/>
<br/>
And these programs aren’t truly duplex; when one person speaks loudly, 
it cuts out the quieter person. This makes conversations sound 
unnatural. Even experienced radio hosts sometimes naturally talk over 
each other a little bit, especially at the end of one person speaking 
and the start of another person speaking. We needed software that is 
full-duplex so the audience feels like they’re in the same room with the
 people speaking, rather then having it feel like one person should say “<em>Over…</em>”
 when finished with a sentence. FeenPhone being true duplex makes it 
superior to all other programs in making conversations more conversational….more 
natural, less artificial<br/>
<br/>
Another way the true duplex makes FeenPhone better is in producing a 
show with remote co-hosts using music. With other programs, when 
the bumper music comes in, any host talking over it to lead into, or out
 of, a talk segment gets squashed down by the music, and you can’t 
easily hear what they’re saying. With FeenPhone, both the music and the 
other person sounds clear.<br/>
<br/>
Skype, Mumble, TeamSpeak, Blink, Google Hangouts etc. all have their 
uses…general phone calls or 50 people yelling at each other while 
gaming. But those VoIP programs are not sufficient for doing 
broadcast-quality conversational audio in real time over a distance. 
They’re all made for using cheap headset mics in noisy locations over 
varying quality Internet. Therefore, you’ll never get stellar sound from
 any of them. Plus, FeenPhone is P2P, those others use a central server 
to connect , which lowers audio quality and increases latency, audio 
artifacting and drop-outs. It also decreases privacy; some of those 
programs do not share their source code, so who knows <em>how</em> they work or <em>what</em> they’re doing with your data and call records?<br/>
<br/>
The criteria for making audio for podcasting, radio and remote voiceover
 are different than for general phone calls and gaming. We created <b>FeenPhone</b>,
 a free program for podcasters, Internet radio shows, 
voiceover artists, filmmakers, radio hosts and radio station STL links 
that meets our unique needs. We built a ground-up peer-to-peer system 
designed for very low latency, no drop-outs and excellent sound when 
used in a room with little or no background noise with decent mics over 
good cable Internet (or even DSL) connections.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Uses for FeenPhone</h3>
<p>FeenPhone enables ultra-high-quality spoken audio in real time when 
doing live media with others in remote locations. It is already being 
used by radio hosts and Internet radio hosts for great-sounding live 
shows. It’s being used by podcasters to make multi-host shows where the 
hosts live thousands of miles apart. It’s a boon for voiceover artists 
working with remote clients or producers.<br/>
<br/>
FeenPhone can be used by filmmakers to direct and record voiceover 
talent in a different location for film narration, or to direct and 
record actors for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubbing_%28filmmaking%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ADR </a>-
 dubbing lines after the filming is completed. It can be used to direct 
and record native speakers in other countries when dubbing 
foreign-language versions of films.<br/>
<br/>
FeenPhone could be adapted for low-bandwidth ultra-high-quality 
one-to-many streaming servers for delivery of Internet radio shows.<br/>
<br/>
FeenPhone can be used by radio stations for STL (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio/transmitter_link"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">studio-to-tower links)</a>.
 And this STL capability could be extended to connect a radio network to
 affiliate stations, replacing the need for costly satellite time, 
dishes and receiver hardware.<br/>
<br/>
FeenPhone could be adapted for ultra-high-quality phone calls on mobile 
devices. FeenPhone can also be used 
to take calls on a call-in show, with better audio quality than other programs, 
and with much higher quality than phones. It could also be used by 
journalists in the field filing live reports, by radio hosts doing “man 
on the street” interviews and for live remotes from sporting and other 
events.<br/>
<br/>
FeenPhone could be used for transmitting <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push-to-talk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">push-to-talk</a> citizen journalism from 
rallies, demonstrations, police stops and arrests to send 
ultra-high-quality audio to a team and/or a remote recorder in case the transmitting 
device is confiscated. (Could be programmed so three quick pushes on the device key locks it in transmit mode until a code is entered to unlock it.) These are situations where it’s of the utmost 
importance that every word is audible and discernible, and cell phone 
audio is anything but clear.</p>

<h3>FeenPhone Mission <br/>
</h3>
Most independently produced audio sounds somewhat crunchy, awful, 
thin and/or distorted. If people have to struggle through your sound 
they’ll leave the website or change the channel and miss your message.<br/>
<br/>
Some people with mediocre production quality make excuses about 
their audio being “good enough for the Internet”, but it’s a cop-out. 
And more people have never even <em>considered</em> their audio quality.<br/>
<br/>
Independent Media will not be taken seriously until our production 
values match that of the mainstream media. And listeners who don’t 
specifically notice audio quality enough to say “That sounds great!” 
will still listen longer and more often to the better sounding show, all
 other things being equal. They will also recommend the better sounding 
show more to other people, even if they don’t know why.<br/>
<br/>
You can be lazy and use other VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) 
programs right 
out the box to make mediocre disposable media. Those programs are good 
for calls, but are not made for making broadcast-quality media. FeenPhone is made for 
making broadcast-quality media. So you can use FeenPhone AND take a little bit of care to 
be stellar and make media that people <em>crave</em>, today and into the future, all over the earth and beyond. It's your choice.<br/><br/>

<h3>Tech stuff<br/>
</h3>
<p>FeenPhone is true duplex and uses Opus codec over TCP (that's right, not UDP) with advanced intelligent buffer systems to lower latency and provide smooth, natural sound. It has no echo cancellation or noise reduction (by design). If this makes sense to you and you want to know more, please feel free to look at the source code, <a href=""http://feenphone.com/?page_id=239"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. <br/></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
FeenPhone sounds much better than Skype, Mumble, TeamSpeak, Blink, Ventrilo, Google Hangouts, mobile phones or landlines.

FeenPhone is no-cost software that opens up a global 
world of possibilities for real-time high-quality voice media 
production, or simply conversation, over any distance.

Before FeenPhone, there has never been a way to do ultra-high-quality full-duplex talk communication in real time for free. FeenPhone does all this, and you can start using it today.
But we have a lot of round-two improvements we'll need to make to revolutionize no-cost high-quality real-time spoken audio over the Internet. 
  





Why not just use Existing programs?
FeenPhone is superior to other voice-over-Internet programs or mobile phones in audio quality. FeenPhone sounds crystal clear compared 
to all these programs / platforms.

And these programs aren’t truly duplex; when one person speaks loudly, 
it cuts out the quieter person. This makes conversations sound 
unnatural. Even experienced radio hosts sometimes naturally talk over 
each other a little bit, especially at the end of one person speaking 
and the start of another person speaking. We needed software that is 
full-duplex so the audience feels like they’re in the same room with the
 people speaking, rather then having it feel like one person should say “Over…”
 when finished with a sentence. FeenPhone being true duplex makes it 
superior to all other programs in making conversations more conversational….more 
natural, less artificial

Another way the true duplex makes FeenPhone better is in producing a 
show with remote co-hosts using music. With other programs, when 
the bumper music comes in, any host talking over it to lead into, or out
 of, a talk segment gets squashed down by the music, and you can’t 
easily hear what they’re saying. With FeenPhone, both the music and the 
other person sounds clear.

Skype, Mumble, TeamSpeak, Blink, Google Hangouts etc. all have their 
uses…general phone calls or 50 people yelling at each other while 
gaming. But those VoIP programs are not sufficient for doing 
broadcast-quality conversational audio in real time over a distance. 
They’re all made for using cheap headset mics in noisy locations over 
varying quality Internet. Therefore, you’ll never get stellar sound from
 any of them. Plus, FeenPhone is P2P, those others use a central server 
to connect , which lowers audio quality and increases latency, audio 
artifacting and drop-outs. It also decreases privacy; some of those 
programs do not share their source code, so who knows how they work or what they’re doing with your data and call records?

The criteria for making audio for podcasting, radio and remote voiceover
 are different than for general phone calls and gaming. We created FeenPhone,
 a free program for podcasters, Internet radio shows, 
voiceover artists, filmmakers, radio hosts and radio station STL links 
that meets our unique needs. We built a ground-up peer-to-peer system 
designed for very low latency, no drop-outs and excellent sound when 
used in a room with little or no background noise with decent mics over 
good cable Internet (or even DSL) connections.

Uses for FeenPhone
FeenPhone enables ultra-high-quality spoken audio in real time when 
doing live media with others in remote locations. It is already being 
used by radio hosts and Internet radio hosts for great-sounding live 
shows. It’s being used by podcasters to make multi-host shows where the 
hosts live thousands of miles apart. It’s a boon for voiceover artists 
working with remote clients or producers.

FeenPhone can be used by filmmakers to direct and record voiceover 
talent in a different location for film narration, or to direct and 
record actors for ADR -
 dubbing lines after the filming is completed. It can be used to direct 
and record native speakers in other countries when dubbing 
foreign-language versions of films.

FeenPhone could be adapted for low-bandwidth ultra-high-quality 
one-to-many streaming servers for delivery of Internet radio shows.

FeenPhone can be used by radio stations for STL (studio-to-tower links).
 And this STL capability could be extended to connect a radio network to
 affiliate stations, replacing the need for costly satellite time, 
dishes and receiver hardware.

FeenPhone could be adapted for ultra-high-quality phone calls on mobile 
devices. FeenPhone can also be used 
to take calls on a call-in show, with better audio quality than other programs, 
and with much higher quality than phones. It could also be used by 
journalists in the field filing live reports, by radio hosts doing “man 
on the street” interviews and for live remotes from sporting and other 
events.

FeenPhone could be used for transmitting push-to-talk citizen journalism from 
rallies, demonstrations, police stops and arrests to send 
ultra-high-quality audio to a team and/or a remote recorder in case the transmitting 
device is confiscated. (Could be programmed so three quick pushes on the device key locks it in transmit mode until a code is entered to unlock it.) These are situations where it’s of the utmost 
importance that every word is audible and discernible, and cell phone 
audio is anything but clear.
    
FeenPhone Mission 

Most independently produced audio sounds somewhat crunchy, awful, 
thin and/or distorted. If people have to struggle through your sound 
they’ll leave the website or change the channel and miss your message.

Some people with mediocre production quality make excuses about 
their audio being “good enough for the Internet”, but it’s a cop-out. 
And more people have never even considered their audio quality.

Independent Media will not be taken seriously until our production 
values match that of the mainstream media. And listeners who don’t 
specifically notice audio quality enough to say “That sounds great!” 
will still listen longer and more often to the better sounding show, all
 other things being equal. They will also recommend the better sounding 
show more to other people, even if they don’t know why.

You can be lazy and use other VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) 
programs right 
out the box to make mediocre disposable media. Those programs are good 
for calls, but are not made for making broadcast-quality media. FeenPhone is made for 
making broadcast-quality media. So you can use FeenPhone AND take a little bit of care to 
be stellar and make media that people crave, today and into the future, all over the earth and beyond. It's your choice.

Tech stuff

FeenPhone is true duplex and uses Opus codec over TCP (that's right, not UDP) with advanced intelligent buffer systems to lower latency and provide smooth, natural sound. It has no echo cancellation or noise reduction (by design). If this makes sense to you and you want to know more, please feel free to look at the source code, here. 


  Goals for FeenPhone 
We will do as much work on improving FeenPhone as we can. If we get some funding, we'll do a bunch of improvements. If we get more funding we'll do more. Here's a partial list of improvements we'd like to make:
--Automatic port forwarding.
--Encryption.
--Port randomizing option (within a range).
--General overall improvements in all functionalities.
--Ability to mute and block persons in conversation.
--Toggable gentle EQ boost at 12hz
--IP address display, and ability to copy IP address to the clipboard.
--Add a “Phone book” to save different IP connections and add name or label.
--Add ability to save different configurations name them so you call them up easily.
--Option to auto-adjust settings for best sound and lowest latency depending on network.

--WASAPI support for Audio In. 
--Ability to roll over to a second pre-set IP if first connection is lost. 
--Volume slider for each user
--Cough button.
--Audio alerts on incoming connection (can be toggled on/off)
--Audio alerts switchable to off.
--Switchable auto-answer function (with password protection).
--Auto-reconnect if the connection drops.
--Input / Output level sliders
--Ability to use stereo.
--Recording (WAV, 16-bit 44.1k mono and stereo).
--Mix Minus (this would be a holy grail, it would make this a killer app by replacing audio hardware).
--Automation interface with relay closures
--PAN left and right: for recording two-host shows for later mixing.
--WebRTC support (for callers calling in to a radio show or podcast).
--Pro interface and website.
--even higher audio quality and reliability
--IPv6 support.
--No clicking.
--Possible Windows Phone version.

--Possible Linux version via open sourcing (currently is Windows only)

--Possible Mac version via open sourcing.
--Possible Android version via open sourcing.

</h3>
<p class=""full-description"">The Park will have an eatery offering healthy food choices with beer and wine options, outdoor seating with fire pits and clean restrooms with handicap facilities. Professional coaching and private lessons will be offered. A dryslope surface to practice your winter sports year round is our main goal. We have applied for permits for a future zipline and ropes course to be installed and a BMX bridge track is in our sights. There will be outdoor yoga classes and a Gibbon Slackline Park area. A signed safety and liability waiver will be required to use the facility. </p>
<p class=""full-description"">Other on property activities will include family recreation such as frisbee, croquet, cornhole and volleyball court.

<p class=""dotty"">I have a team of top pro athletes on stand by to coach, promote and help maintain the integrity of this Park.

The majority of seasonal activity takes place between the first of June and the end of July.</p><p>Our aim is to present quidditch in an elegant, highly-consumable form that mirrors other sports’ professional leagues. MLQ will feature standardized schedules, high-level officiating, in-depth statistics and live or pre-recorded footage of all games. The central tenant of the league, setting it apart from previous quidditch leagues, is that we will be limiting the field of participating teams. This will both ensure that the teams are of a high-quality and maximize the amount of coverage that can be given to each team and each game.</p><p>The inaugural season of MLQ will begin on June 1, 2015 with eight teams. Starting in 2016, the league will consist of 16 to 20 teams from across the nation. <br/><br/>As you may have guessed, founding a professional sports league is a massive undertaking.

Major League Quidditch (MLQ) is a national league that runs from June 1 to August 31. The majority of seasonal activity takes place between the first of June and the end of July.Our aim is to present quidditch in an elegant, highly-consumable form that mirrors other sports’ professional leagues. MLQ will feature standardized schedules, high-level officiating, in-depth statistics and live or pre-recorded footage of all games. The central tenant of the league, setting it apart from previous quidditch leagues, is that we will be limiting the field of participating teams. This will both ensure that the teams are of a high-quality and maximize the amount of coverage that can be given to each team and each game.The inaugural season of MLQ will begin on June 1, 2015 with eight teams. Starting in 2016, the league will consist of 16 to 20 teams from across the nation. As you may have guessed, founding a professional sports league is a massive undertaking. All funds for this campaign will go toward paying for uniforms, referee fees, field permits, non-profit status and equipment, among other things. What is quidditch? Quidditch is a co-ed, full-contact sport. Find out more about professional quidditch: mlquidditch.comWhat do you get out of this? We are offering so many options you won't know which to purchase first!

<p style=""font-size: 105%;"">Don't you hate it when family members and friends light up a cigarette or vape? Hate the smell, the damage they are doing to their bodies, and the waste of money? Almost all smokers have tried to quit several times, but have failed. Why? Because smoking is as much a mental habit as it is an addiction.</p>
<div style=""padding: 35px 0px 20px 15px; float: right;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440509998/wifvc6b1xdcfge6xkqpc.png"" src="""" style=""width: 305px; height: 235px; float: right;""/></div><p>If we approach quitting with a clear plan to change the way our brains think about smoking, we can easily and quickly leave this nasty and expensive habit behind us, and go on to make further changes to our lifestyles like getting fitter and  eating better.</p><p><b>Our unique ""Programme in a Box"" gives smokers all the tools to change their lives in 15 days.</b></p>
<p>THE BEYOND NICOTINE  programme  comes in a kit and is a revolutionary way to  help even the hard core smoker to quit easily and permanently because it uses latest science to help smokers change the way our brains think, supported by effective homeopathic anti crave formulas and a body and lung cleansing detox course, and  some really cool downloadable apps too!</p>
<p><b>Our 15 day programme is very effective, has been awarded a NDC Number and is now available on selected e commerce sites. And this is just the start.</b></p>
<br/><hr/><br/>
<h3>How we will help smokers in the US and the World...</h3>
<p>We now intend to take this programme to the almost 50 million smokers in America, and via a Spanish translation reach  many more smokers in Central and South America.</p>

<p>Given the disproportionately high rate of smoking in Hispanic 
communities, help us fund a translation process so the programme may be 
better used by those that really need the help, in their first language.</p>
<p>Finally, although we have a NDC number and FDA registrations, we need to secure our copyrights, IP and registrations as protection from the giant drug companies and the tobacco industry who will guard their investments.</p>

Don't you hate it when family members and friends light up a cigarette or vape? Hate the smell, the damage they are doing to their bodies, and the waste of money? Almost all smokers have tried to quit several times, but have failed. Why? Because smoking is as much a mental habit as it is an addiction.
If we approach quitting with a clear plan to change the way our brains think about smoking, we can easily and quickly leave this nasty and expensive habit behind us, and go on to make further changes to our lifestyles like getting fitter and  eating better.Our unique ""Programme in a Box"" gives smokers all the tools to change their lives in 15 days.
THE BEYOND NICOTINE  programme  comes in a kit and is a revolutionary way to  help even the hard core smoker to quit easily and permanently because it uses latest science to help smokers change the way our brains think, supported by effective homeopathic anti crave formulas and a body and lung cleansing detox course, and  some really cool downloadable apps too!
Our 15 day programme is very effective, has been awarded a NDC Number and is now available on selected e commerce sites. And this is just the start.

How we will help smokers in the US and the World...
We now intend to take this programme to the almost 50 million smokers in America, and via a Spanish translation reach  many more smokers in Central and South America.
To reach smokers at community level and in the workplace, we plan to train Wellness Practitioners, probably existing therapists, teachers, oral hygienists or psychologists, to present our effective 90 minute Workshops in their towns and counties, effectively boosting their own small businesses with skills that will earn income, and help communities.
Given the disproportionately high rate of smoking in Hispanic 
communities, help us fund a translation process so the programme may be 
better used by those that really need the help, in their first language.
Finally, although we have a NDC number and FDA registrations, we need to secure our copyrights, IP and registrations as protection from the giant drug companies and the tobacco industry who will guard their investments.

How we may Thank You
If you contribute $50, we will send a free Beyond Nicotine kit to a smoker of your choice in your name, and send two kits to your smoking family and friends for every $100.
For every contribution of $500 we will stage a free 90 minute quit smoking in the workplace online webinar for the company you work for, throwing in 12 kits for attendees.For each contribution of $1500 we will invite a nominee of your choice to attend a free Beyond Nicotine Therapists full day training course in Orlando. Here they will learn the techniques of counselling smokers and preparing them to quit.
This will Including training on presentation skills, marketing tips and allow the attendee use of presentation materials and Power Point presentation aid, and sufficient free kits to resell to allow the therapist to make over one thousand Dollars when resold.

The beauty of the Beyond Nicotine approach...
We know smokers really would prefer not to smoke. In fact generally they are sick to death of the whole smoking/quitting cycle. They just don't know how to finally make the move!
If your partner, your parents, your kids or colleagues smoke, you have the power to set them free by introducing to them this novel and very effective psychological and  homeopathic combination that changes lives.
The great thing is, this is not a new start-up. We have proven the programme is effective and helped thousands of smokers to realise quitting is an option! We have done our homework via legal registrations and health registrations and have manufactured advance stock in the USA.All we need is to let smokers know the cavalry has arrived. 

Risks & Challenges
 We are the new kids on the block, small guys with a proven, tested and hugely beneficial product and great intentions.And we need your help to fund the marketing and expansion of the next stage of this project, confident Beyond Nicotine will soon be a household name.Our programme really works, it's novel and fun and has helped thousands of smokers start a whole new phase of their lives as confident, proud achievers Beyond Nicotine. Come on, its time to stop the nonsense, smoking is just not an option anymore.

<p>HUSAMBAE community
based organization is a nonprofit making voluntary community. We are based in
Kisumu City in the Western region of Kenya, and our work is caring for orphans
and vulnerable children, widows and people living with HIV/AIDS and affected by
HIV/AIDS. The centre strives to promote the rights and respect for orphans and
other vulnerable children, widows, and grandmothers who are the caregivers. </p>
<p>The centre was
started in 2007 by Michael Joseph Bole, the Director of the organization after
realizing the high poverty rate, a factor which makes the community greatly vulnerable to the HIV scourge. The organization was officially
registered as a non profit with the Ministry of Gender, Sport, Culture and
Social Services in the year 2008 to carry out it’s duties for supporting the
HIV/AIDS orphans, vulnerable children and widows. </p>
<p>The organization acts
as resource mobilization strategy to cater for the plight of orphans, widows
and PLHIV’s (persons Living With HIV) to address their needs, pioneer their
rights, and campaign towards stigma reduction. The role of HUSAMBAE is to respond
meaningfully to the impact of HIV/AIDS in the community through health care to access antiretroviral drugs and education for the orphans and vulnerable
children we serve.</p><div>

<p>Husambae Community

to attain their full potential and contribute to the well being of the family,
society and our county.</p>
<p><b>MISSION </b></p>
<p>To create a positive
change in people’s lives, by partnering with other organizations to implement
innovative solutions to critical social, cultural and economic problems.</p>
<p>The project is being
implemented with Nyanza province in area of newly created Kisumu County in the
Kenya constitution. The catchment area of Husambae project Kisumu East District
child link covered in the last five years through laid down strategies such as
capacity building on knowledge, skills and communication on facts on HIV/AIDS,
social family life education. Outreach programs include counselling services, community group mobilization, home visits, and monitoring and evaluation. Reintegration
to the community involves training mentors for care giving and rehabilitation
of neglected children.</p>
<p>Husambae Community Based Organization has also been running a widow's empowerment program to enable the children and widows we work with to curb the grievous psychological torture affecting them and to contain the impact of HIV/AIDS at community level.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP</b></p>
<p>Over the past three years, HUSAMBAE has been running a program targeting
poor families, people with HIV/AIDS, TB, Malaria and other diseases for orphans,
other vulnerable children and widows who have no hope. </p>
<p>We do not
have a local clinic for the people we serve to get medication since the nearest
Hospital is 215km to reach when patients fall
sick; this is a 3.5 hour journey! This has made us lose many lives and it has also been a BIG problem to
the whole community that serve.</p>
<p>We need your support
to build a local clinic.  We have
already consulted with the community, Government departmental, local area
administration and all relevant legal departments concerned with health, land
and housing. They support the project and all that is needed now is to raise
the funds to construct a health clinic. This will allow us to serve our local
community through the improvement of our local standard of living conditions of
children’s health, psychosocial care, nutrition, education, economic and gender
development. </p>

This same
project was previously evaluated in August 2008, which helped the project to
focus on the right direction so we could be sure to achieve the set goals and
objectives. The project had 325 various women groups registered with the
Ministry of children, Gender and social Development. The
evaluation realized that there was a need to promote mobilization of children
with focus on strengthening mentoring process on a structured basis and to
initiate an HIV/AIDS program giving them opportunity access basic services. It
also diagnosed that there is need to enhanced food security through teaching
better methods of farming and each caregiver to establish a kitchen garden in
the homestead that will address nutritional status among the children in our district.<div>

justifies why HUSAMBE keenly focuses its efforts on working with children and

<p>Dear Community,<br/>Our dear friend and beloved author, Tara Hardy, needs help. In January 2012, we came to you after Tara had been in the hospital with a life-threatening, undiagnosed health condition. Since that fundraiser, Tara has been admitted to the hospital three more times, has undergone chemotherapy, and is fighting to stay alive.</p>
<p>Our first fundraiser was to help Tara seek a diagnosis. After going to doctor after doctor as her symptoms worsened, she now has a diagnosis. Two of them: a life threatening blood disorder called I.T.P. and an underlying immune disorder called Lyme Disease (more below).</p>
<p>We have put together this donation page to help alleviate some of the financial burden Tara faces. She is currently undergoing a rigorous two-year treatment, the cost of which not covered by health insurance is $18,000 per year. </p>
<p>Tara’s work as a poet, queer activist, and teacher has strengthened so many hearts across this country and we want more than anything to pay it forward. No contribution is too small. <strong>Our overall goal is to fundraise as much as we can to help Tara sustain good medical care.</strong></p>
<p>Tara’s local community in Seattle is also organizing a benefit for Friday, May 31st called <a href=""http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/384642"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BOOST: Poetry to Uplift Your Spirits</a>. Please consider donating a book of your poems or artwork to be sold at the BOOST show.</p>

<p><strong>Gratitude, and A Note About Privilege (from Tara)</strong></p>
<p>It is my tremendous fortune to have such a loving and generous community of people to ask for help. My gratitude overwhelms me, rearranges me. The love and support that have come my way during the last year have shifted my notions about humanity and the universe. Community literally keeps me alive.</p>
<p>Additionally, I want to acknowledge the privilege it is to have a community of people I can ask for help. Speaking of privilege, among other things, being able-bodied for so many years allowed me to cultivate such a community. However, I am no more deserving than the many people who live with challenges such as chronic illness. So many chronically ill people go without support; I believe we should all be more concerned about this (me included). The problem is systemic. Not only is there a crisis regarding access to health care in the U.S., but the isolation surrounding illness and disability is a cultural issue that we must address for every person to be valued, supported, and surrounded by vital community. In the name of supporting community, I encourage us all to give what we can to people who need help. Speaking of…</p>

<p><strong>What are Tara’s diagnoses?  </strong>I.T.P. (Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura) is a rare blood disorder that causes one’s platelets to disappear without warning, putting one at risk for internal bleeding including brain hemorrhage. Doctors have no idea what causes I.T.P.</p>
<p>Lyme Disease is caused by being bitten by an infected tick, and is called the “great imitator” for the way it mimics many illnesses, making it difficult to diagnose. The disease is chronic, but with treatment many patients regain some level of health.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What are Tara’s treatments?  </strong>Last summer Tara underwent an I.V. chemotherapy designed to kill the cells in her immune system that were destroying her platelets.

<p>Tara is also receiving treatment for Lyme Disease, which includes an intense regimen of antibiotics and other drugs, the side effects of which are fairly debilitating and much like chemotherapy.</p>

<p><strong>How is Tara doing/feeling?  </strong>Tara is in a stage of treatment when the medications actually make her feel worse. She is unable to work. Last fall she taught in a high school one day a week, but those days would send her to bed for several days each time. Here and there she is able to teach a two-hour class (while seated). Whenever she is up to it, she loves to jump on stage and perform a poem or two. </p>
<p>Tara is writing like mad. She has written an entirely new book of poems about body and illness. She is also writing a book about writing (a writer’s guide to undoing self-sabotage).</p>
<p>In Tara’s words, “Mostly, I’m in a full-time fight for my life. But, strangely, there’s a lot of beauty in here. There’s an unexpected amount of humor, and I regularly experience an unfathomable gratitude for my life. Illness is a remarkable, if brutal, teacher. More than anything, I’m grateful for my community who keeps me alive. The fact that people want me on this planet keeps me rooted here.”</p>

<div><span><strong>Vision Dots can help a billion people see that the world does care about them by allowing them to build themselves a pair of glasses.</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong> </strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong> </strong></span></div>
<div><strong>Quick intro      Can something so simple actually work?</strong></div>
<div><span><strong> </strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong>Vision Dots are at the moment the simplest solution to provide eye care to the poor. Showing off Vision Dots as a viable alternative in eye care is our focus. We have the solution that makes the most sense and our focus is to make enough noise to get Vison Dots implemented fast. Simplicity unfortunately is the only possible solution to this complex problem. It is not in the worlds best interest to have a billion people not contributing fully to their society because they don't have access to glasses that cost a dollar.</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong> </strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong>Our focus is to pilot Vision Dots in a real setting and try to understand if the glasses or the way they are dispensed can be improved. Once everything has been perfected we are going to encourage organizations and governments to implement our vision.</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong> </strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong><img alt=""Vision Dot Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/737349/pictures/full/20130402213510-visiondots_logo.png?1364963712"" src="""" style="""" title=""Vision Dot Logo""/></strong></span></div>
<div><strong><em>We need help to provide the proof that Vision Dots and the idea of self serve eye care will work. Documenting the effort in real time will make the logic and simplicity come to life. Serving 10 000 people at one location with eye care in a day requieres a new way of thinking. Vision Dots hopefully will start an evolution of implementing simplicity to a world that is leaving too many issues and people in the dark. </em></strong></div>
<div><strong><em><img alt=""Single Vision Dot (right)"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/737361/pictures/full/20130402214519-Vision-Dots-2-1.jpg?1364964321"" src="""" style="""" title=""Single vision Dot (right eye)""/></em></strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just image the word gets out in your overcrowded village "" they "" are allowing you to build a pair of glasses on Tuesday. 8000 people start to line up and you the organiser better keep the line moving despensing glasses. Doing in depth eye exams for every single person just can't work in a setting like this. Involving the patient is the only solution to serve the masses. ""Grab a plate and make yourself a pair of glasses""</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<img alt=""vision for the poor Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/737345/pictures/full/20130402213324-vision4poor_logo.png?1364963605"" src="""" style="""" title=""vision for the poor Logo""/> </div>
<div> </div>
<div><span><strong>The Problem</strong></span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<span>It is estimated that up to one billion people aren’t able to afford corrective eye care. In essence what this really means </span><span>is</span><span> we have one billion people struggling with simple daily actives, not being able to earn an income,  not being able to do well in school or whatever else poor vision throws at these individuals.</span>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div><span>The New York Times  estimates <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/27/health/investing-in-eyeglasses-for-poor-would-boost-international-economy.html?_r=1&amp;"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/27/health/investing-in-eyeglasses-for-poor-would-boost-international-economy.html?_r=1&amp;</span></a>  that it would cost 28 billion to provide this group with eye care services and in return these individuals with proper vision could  generate 200 billion dollars worth of additional economical output. </span></div>
<div> </div>
<div><span>The World Health Organization <a href=""http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/10/12-104034/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/10/12-104034/en/</span></a> is suggesting to train a huge network of eye care specialists to deal with the masses that need eye care. The shortage of trained optometrists is staggering and the WHO is suggesting to train 68 000 eye care specialists and create facilities and purchase equipment to solve the current epidemic. The estimate for such a radical approach  would be 28 billion dollars and would take decades to implement. Even with this massive expenditure we still have to remember that not a single person has received a pair of eye glasses.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div><span>The Stanford Social Innovation review describes all current efforts to provide eye care to the poor in this article. </span></div>
<div><span><a href=""http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/better_vision_for_the_poor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/better_vision_for_the_poor</a></span></div>
<div><span>The article is really describing the attempts made by all groups as having no impact on the current crisis. The issue of all the solutions simply costing too much money for the poor to afford, seems to be the major issue and main reason non of the attempts have worked. The direct delivery also doesn't work since no eye care specialsts are available to assist in prescribing glasses.</span></div>
<p><span><strong>Providing vision for the poor needs the simplest solution possible.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>My name is Jeff Widderich from Victoria BC. I am an inventor. I make a living using the concepts that I create and make products out of the ideas. I invent, create, build and sell what I have inside my brain. I am very good at taking concepts and turning them into reality efficiently and with a great deal of pride. </span></p>
<p><span>The concept "" Vision For The Poor "" and the solution to the problem ""Vision Dots"" is an enormous undertaking to even contemplate solving with out support. I am asking for help. My drive and passion is to see this concept help the estimated 1billion people that can't afford eye care to finally see their world clearly.</span></p>
<p><span>All current solutions that attempt to provide eye care are not working because they are too complex or way too expensive. </span></p>
<p><span><img alt=""vision Stick "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/742403/pictures/original/20130405225732-image-copy.png?1365227855"" src="""" style="""" title=""Vision Stick used to find the right lens""/> </span></p>
<p><strong>Vision Dots solves following issues that have been plaguing other attempts</strong></p>
<p><span>* cost under <strong>a dollar</strong> to make per pair ( order of 10 000)</span></p>
<p><span>* <strong>self prescribing</strong> (involving eye care professionals simply isn't an option they aren't available in the regions Vision Dots are needy)</span></p>
<p><strong>How to deliver eye care (simplified approach)</strong></p>
<p>a) form a line grab a plate and build a pair of glasses as you are walking beside a table with all the components and different lenses laid out on tables. Eye Charts are in place for the self examination.<strong> (buffet style) </strong></p>
<p><span>b) open a tackle box and provide eye care similar to applying a bandage. Everything needed is inside the box. Schools and disaster relief. (<strong> tackle box eye care</strong>)</span></p>
<p><span>* compact shipping due to the size of the product and how the frames fit inside each other. We estimate 10 000 pairs to fit inside one cubic meter. (36  cubic feet). "" Reduces shipping costs immensely and the shipment would be easier to conceal entering dangerous regions where theft is rampant.</span></p>
<p><span>Additional benefits</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>New glasses, no sorting of mountains of used glasses with odd prescriptions. Each eye can have a different prescription simply by popping in a specific lens.</span></li>
<li><span>Shipments are so compact that they can be shipped directly from the factory to the area of the world that needs them. 1 cubic meter = 10 000 pairs</span></li>
<li><span>The lenses are of extremely good quality (UV and scratch coating) </span></li>
<li><span>The lens frame is so flexible you can apply incredible force before they don't break (soft plastic)</span></li>
<li><span>The string that holds the pair together will make it easy for children to conceal their pride and joy and it will be harder for them to loose the glasses.</span></li>
<li><span>If for example an order of 10 000 lenses is being produced. We have already established  with the manufacturer the ratios we need to produce for the different prescriptions.</span></li>
<li><span> Existing efforts to provide eye care to the poor will rapidly switch over to the concept of Vision Dots which would make distribution efforts a lot more effective.(piggy backing)</span></li>
<li><span>The tackle boxes make a great business opportunity for the poor to make a living selling mobile eye care.  </span></li>
<li><span>The poor would feel a sense of accomplishment building their own pair of glasses on the spot.</span></li>
<li><span>glasses allow the poor to work and children will do better in school being able to seethe black board or read books.</span></li>
<li><span>the Vision Dot design is better suited for the rough and tumble world of living in poverty. They are part of the body once the string tightens the lenses.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Costs to go live </strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Rapid prototyping</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Finish all prototyping work for Vision Dots and Vision sticks, nose clips  ( the device used to hold lenses up when the patient is checking the different lenses     4800.00</span></p>
<p><span> We are still working on making the frames look really fashionable and possibly even more streamlined.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Glass set up</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Pay the eye glass manufacturers 3200.00 to make casting dyes that fit the frames perfectly. Currently they are cutting these tiny lenses out of bigger stock to make samples.</span></p>
<p><span>(Manufacturer in place) 6 month relationship  Prices quoted samples in place</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Injection molds</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Finalize CAD drawings from the prototyping efforts and start the injection molds for the frames. The molds would be a set of 6 left frames and 6 right frames set up to be stamped once bringing the price down to 10 - 14 cents per frame.   30 000.00- 40 000</span></p>
<p><span>Two Vision stick molds  6 000 - 8 000</span></p>
<p><span>Nose clips 2400 -3000</span></p>
<p><span>(Manufacturer in place ) established relationship for 7 years      Prices quoted </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Tackle Boxes</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The model to be used is already tooled and is perfect for 300 sets of glasses with 40 different prescriptions, six Vision sticks, clips and string. </span></p>
<p><span>Order 1000 tackle boxes at a price of 7.87 each       7 870.00- 10 000.00</span></p>
<p><span>(Manufacturer in place) new relationship  Prices quoted  samples in place</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Build 1000 Tackle Boxes</strong></span></p>
<p><span>at a price of 48 000.00 to 60 000.00 </span></p>
<p><span>Delivery of those boxes to deserving schools through the Red Cross 3800 - 4800</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Eye Charts</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Buy 1500 eye charts   1.78 to include in all packages    </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>One Skid pilot project</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>10 000 bulk packed lenses, 10 000 frames 100 vision sticks, string and nose clips, eye charts, shipping and duties</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>(Buffet Concept)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Donated to an existing organization with the strict requirement that the distribution process is documented in full. Short falls and successes are documented. I want to be present when the Vision Dots “ hit the street’’ to film the process to see first hand. Also use this video to gain more publicity.</span></p>
<p><span>38 000 to 49 000 </span> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>The Impact</strong></span> </p>
<p><span>This direct approach of getting this project done is the only way it is going to happen. The real idea would be to get to the people directly, documenting the effort and spreading the results virally on Youtube and other forms of Social Media.

Quick intro      Can something so simple actually work?
 
Vision Dots are at the moment the simplest solution to provide eye care to the poor. Showing off Vision Dots as a viable alternative in eye care is our focus. We have the solution that makes the most sense and our focus is to make enough noise to get Vison Dots implemented fast. Simplicity unfortunately is the only possible solution to this complex problem. It is not in the worlds best interest to have a billion people not contributing fully to their society because they don't have access to glasses that cost a dollar.
 
Our focus is to pilot Vision Dots in a real setting and try to understand if the glasses or the way they are dispensed can be improved. Once everything has been perfected we are going to encourage organizations and governments to implement our vision.
 

We need help to provide the proof that Vision Dots and the idea of self serve eye care will work. Documenting the effort in real time will make the logic and simplicity come to life. Serving 10 000 people at one location with eye care in a day requieres a new way of thinking. Vision Dots hopefully will start an evolution of implementing simplicity to a world that is leaving too many issues and people in the dark. 

 
Just image the word gets out in your overcrowded village "" they "" are allowing you to build a pair of glasses on Tuesday. 8000 people start to line up and you the organiser better keep the line moving despensing glasses. Doing in depth eye exams for every single person just can't work in a setting like this. Involving the patient is the only solution to serve the masses. ""Grab a plate and make yourself a pair of glasses""
 

 
 
The Problem
 

It is estimated that up to one billion people aren’t able to afford corrective eye care. In essence what this really means is we have one billion people struggling with simple daily actives, not being able to earn an income,  not being able to do well in school or whatever else poor vision throws at these individuals.

 
The New York Times  estimates http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/27/health/investing-in-eyeglasses-for-poor-would-boost-international-economy.html?_r=1&  that it would cost 28 billion to provide this group with eye care services and in return these individuals with proper vision could  generate 200 billion dollars worth of additional economical output. 
 
The World Health Organization http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/10/12-104034/en/ is suggesting to train a huge network of eye care specialists to deal with the masses that need eye care. The shortage of trained optometrists is staggering and the WHO is suggesting to train 68 000 eye care specialists and create facilities and purchase equipment to solve the current epidemic. The estimate for such a radical approach  would be 28 billion dollars and would take decades to implement. Even with this massive expenditure we still have to remember that not a single person has received a pair of eye glasses.
 
The Stanford Social Innovation review describes all current efforts to provide eye care to the poor in this article. 
http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/better_vision_for_the_poor
The article is really describing the attempts made by all groups as having no impact on the current crisis. The issue of all the solutions simply costing too much money for the poor to afford, seems to be the major issue and main reason non of the attempts have worked. The direct delivery also doesn't work since no eye care specialsts are available to assist in prescribing glasses.
Providing vision for the poor needs the simplest solution possible.
My name is Jeff Widderich from Victoria BC. I am an inventor. I make a living using the concepts that I create and make products out of the ideas. I invent, create, build and sell what I have inside my brain. I am very good at taking concepts and turning them into reality efficiently and with a great deal of pride. 
The concept "" Vision For The Poor "" and the solution to the problem ""Vision Dots"" is an enormous undertaking to even contemplate solving with out support. I am asking for help. My drive and passion is to see this concept help the estimated 1billion people that can't afford eye care to finally see their world clearly.
All current solutions that attempt to provide eye care are not working because they are too complex or way too expensive. 
 
Vision Dots solves following issues that have been plaguing other attempts
* cost under a dollar to make per pair ( order of 10 000)
* self prescribing (involving eye care professionals simply isn't an option they aren't available in the regions Vision Dots are needy)
How to deliver eye care (simplified approach)
a) form a line grab a plate and build a pair of glasses as you are walking beside a table with all the components and different lenses laid out on tables. Eye Charts are in place for the self examination. (buffet style) 
b) open a tackle box and provide eye care similar to applying a bandage. Everything needed is inside the box. Schools and disaster relief. ( tackle box eye care)
* compact shipping due to the size of the product and how the frames fit inside each other. We estimate 10 000 pairs to fit inside one cubic meter. (36  cubic feet). "" Reduces shipping costs immensely and the shipment would be easier to conceal entering dangerous regions where theft is rampant.
Additional benefits

New glasses, no sorting of mountains of used glasses with odd prescriptions. Each eye can have a different prescription simply by popping in a specific lens.
Shipments are so compact that they can be shipped directly from the factory to the area of the world that needs them. 1 cubic meter = 10 000 pairs
The lenses are of extremely good quality (UV and scratch coating) 
The lens frame is so flexible you can apply incredible force before they don't break (soft plastic)
The string that holds the pair together will make it easy for children to conceal their pride and joy and it will be harder for them to loose the glasses.
If for example an order of 10 000 lenses is being produced. We have already established  with the manufacturer the ratios we need to produce for the different prescriptions.
 Existing efforts to provide eye care to the poor will rapidly switch over to the concept of Vision Dots which would make distribution efforts a lot more effective.(piggy backing)
The tackle boxes make a great business opportunity for the poor to make a living selling mobile eye care.  
The poor would feel a sense of accomplishment building their own pair of glasses on the spot.
glasses allow the poor to work and children will do better in school being able to seethe black board or read books.
the Vision Dot design is better suited for the rough and tumble world of living in poverty. They are part of the body once the string tightens the lenses.

Costs to go live 
Rapid prototyping
Finish all prototyping work for Vision Dots and Vision sticks, nose clips  ( the device used to hold lenses up when the patient is checking the different lenses     4800.00
 We are still working on making the frames look really fashionable and possibly even more streamlined.
 
Glass set up
Pay the eye glass manufacturers 3200.00 to make casting dyes that fit the frames perfectly. Currently they are cutting these tiny lenses out of bigger stock to make samples.
(Manufacturer in place) 6 month relationship  Prices quoted samples in place
Injection molds
Finalize CAD drawings from the prototyping efforts and start the injection molds for the frames. The molds would be a set of 6 left frames and 6 right frames set up to be stamped once bringing the price down to 10 - 14 cents per frame.   30 000.00- 40 000
Two Vision stick molds  6 000 - 8 000
Nose clips 2400 -3000
(Manufacturer in place ) established relationship for 7 years      Prices quoted 
Tackle Boxes
The model to be used is already tooled and is perfect for 300 sets of glasses with 40 different prescriptions, six Vision sticks, clips and string. 
Order 1000 tackle boxes at a price of 7.87 each       7 870.00- 10 000.00
(Manufacturer in place) new relationship  Prices quoted  samples in place
Build 1000 Tackle Boxes
at a price of 48 000.00 to 60 000.00 
Delivery of those boxes to deserving schools through the Red Cross 3800 - 4800
Eye Charts
Buy 1500 eye charts   1.78 to include in all packages    
 
One Skid pilot project
10 000 bulk packed lenses, 10 000 frames 100 vision sticks, string and nose clips, eye charts, shipping and duties
(Buffet Concept)
Donated to an existing organization with the strict requirement that the distribution process is documented in full. Short falls and successes are documented. I want to be present when the Vision Dots “ hit the street’’ to film the process to see first hand. Also use this video to gain more publicity.
38 000 to 49 000  
 
The Impact 
This direct approach of getting this project done is the only way it is going to happen. The real idea would be to get to the people directly, documenting the effort and spreading the results virally on Youtube and other forms of Social Media. The cost of the injection moulds is a big hindrance.  Once the Vision Dots start popping up the snow ball will start rolling. In action the concept will make sense and more importantly it will attract all kinds of praise from the press. Many organizations have already been approached and really think it is a great solution. Piggy backing on their existing efforts will prove “Vision For The Poor” is actually the concept most likely to succeed since the starting parameters give it a fighting chance.
I think once the poor understand how much a pair of glasses can improve their lives the message will spread and glasses will become more main stream amongst the poor. The entire process of Vision Dots is a huge learning curve for all involved. This project has to  be completed.",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Before picking up and leaving to move to the U.S., she was a nurse in a hosiptial - went from ER to delvering babies. She took a chance and got on a flight to NYC one day in the mid 80's and stayed.

<p>The rage in personal enhancement is LLLT</p>
<p>   Bio-Stimulation or Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) is sweeping the world because it does so much to improve people’s lives.  The problem, though, is cost.  A trip to a laser clinic can cost $1,295 to $20,000.  When you breakdown what they are doing at the clinic, you realize all they are doing is shining a laser diode on your body.  These diodes are rated at 100 milliwatts or less.  The equipment, however, can cost over $25,000.    Instead of paying for these incredibly expensive prices and using incredibly expensive machines, we can do exactly the same thing for a mere fraction of the cost.  Innumerable studies from reputable sources have shown all the bells and whistles they put on these high cost machines are not really needed.  Just put the lasers on your body for certain length of time and get exactly the same results.    We have developed, tested, and are ready to produce a low cost unit that will do what the expensive units will do for pennies on the dollar.  Our unit has two 100 mw 650 nm laser diodes with an expected lifespan of 10,000 hours.  It even has a feature not found in the expensive units – a safety switch.  To make sure the lasers never go on without being against the body, a tiny plunger activates the lasers.    But, you need to know what these lasers have been reported by others as doing.  While we make no claims and/or guarantees, here’s a partial list with a URL to examine:   </p>

<p> So many more.  Look up your interest on Google with the ‘LLLT’ keyword.  You’ll almost certainly find where LLLT has come to the rescue.       In the final analysis, all anyone is doing is shining laser diodes on a person’s body.  We can do that inexpensively.  We bought some high quality 100 mw 650 nm (red light) diodes, printed a case on our 3D printer, and hooked up a 5 volt power source.  Presto!  We had what these expensive clinics had.  We put the output against our stomach and the inches vanished.  We knew we had a good product.    What we have left to do is get the molds made so we can manufacture these.  Before we do that, we have to get FDA, UL, and CE approval.  As it is only 100 mw, FDA approval should be a snap.  The UL and CE approval will not be a problem because we will be using a wall adapter that already has UL, CE, and CEC approval.  Thus, we are ready to give the world a low cost alternative to expensive LLLT clinics.</p>
<p>If we don't raise enough money, anyone who does contribute at least $100 will be given lasers printed from our 3D printer.</p>

 So many more.  Look up your interest on Google with the ‘LLLT’ keyword.  You’ll almost certainly find where LLLT has come to the rescue.       In the final analysis, all anyone is doing is shining laser diodes on a person’s body.  We can do that inexpensively.  We bought some high quality 100 mw 650 nm (red light) diodes, printed a case on our 3D printer, and hooked up a 5 volt power source.  Presto!  We had what these expensive clinics had.  We put the output against our stomach and the inches vanished.  We knew we had a good product.    What we have left to do is get the molds made so we can manufacture these.  Before we do that, we have to get FDA, UL, and CE approval.  As it is only 100 mw, FDA approval should be a snap.  The UL and CE approval will not be a problem because we will be using a wall adapter that already has UL, CE, and CEC approval.  Thus, we are ready to give the world a low cost alternative to expensive LLLT clinics.
If we don't raise enough money, anyone who does contribute at least $100 will be given lasers printed from our 3D printer.",2.0,0,"8 Campaigns

<p>Breast cancder is a life changing experience and can bring anxiety, depression, feelings of loss or disconnect, feelings of not being so pretty or feminine.  The disease and the treatment can make a person feel she is so imposing on the ones they love, they don't ask for help as much as they should.  Particularly after reatment has been completed.</p>

From the very beginning we talked of having a family, when we were young and naive we talked of 3 children and even started debating names. Here we are on the cusp of celebrating 11 years of marriage and we have yet to achieve a viable pregnancy. <br/><br/>In June of 2005 we officially began trying to conceive. We were hopeful and excitedly anticipated being able to announce that we were pregnant. Month after month we were disappointed that nothing was happening. I convinced myself that it had only been 6 months. We just needed to be patient, to relax, give it time. Then at the 18 month mark I went in for a routine exam and mentioned to the lady doctor that I was concerned as to how long it was taking for me to get pregnant. She asked a few questions, then handed me a card for the infertility clinic and said to give them a call to set up an appointment. I remember sitting in the exam room and feeling like the floor had dropped out from beneath me.<br/><br/>February 2009 we were officially diagnosed as infertile. Hearing those words was beyond difficult and for a period of time we were in shock. It felt like we were just going through the motions of everyday life, trying to wake up from this nightmare. <br/><br/>Once we got our heads wrapped around the idea that we were going to begin infertility treatments. We were put through a battery of tests. They took so many vials of blood I wasn't sure there was any left in my body. I actually prayed that the doctor would find something wrong. If something was wrong then we could work on fixing it. So while it was wonderful news that they found NO reason that we were having such difficulty conceiving, it was also difficult to be given the label of ‘unexplained infertility’. <br/><br/>Once all of the tests were done and we met with the doctor to discuss the results he came up with a plan of action for us. I was once again filled with hope and excitement. Surely this was the answer, we were on our way to building our family. <br/><br/>For three cycles I took 100mg of Clomid for 5 days, had monitoring appointments every few days and intrauterine inseminations. At the end of every cycle was an immeasurable amount of heartache. The nurses and doctor who treated me seemed genuinely confused as to why it wasn’t  working for us. It was time to step up the level of medications. I completed three more cycles this time with Clomid, Menopur and intrauterine inseminations. At the end of it all we were left with empty arms.

<p>The Jacqueline Sidman Health Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization that was founded by Dr. Jacqueline Sidman in 2007. The purpose is to research how, by working directly with the subconscious mind positive, often immediate, effects can be achieved for one's physical and mental health. Various approaches will be evaluated through clinical studies and trials to be disseminated to the scientific and general public showing the results of the studies.<br/>The first study focuses on healing depression and anxiety in women.<br/>Results from the first study will show how depression and anxiety can be eliminated in a very short time without the use of medication. Our goal is to discover the optimal method for achieving greatly improved mental and physical health through the use of Short-Term Sidman Hypnotherapy (STSH).</p>
<p>Dr. Sidman formed the foundation because there was lack of concrete evidence to prove to the medical community and the public how effectively the subconscious mind can work to help individuals achieve a greater quality of life. If emotional stress can be diminished in this way, the foundation believes that years of suffering can literally be prevented.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Sidman Health Foundation"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1337.photobucket.com/albums/o664/stephanie_2311/Sidman2_zpsa9602985.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Dr. Sidman was invited to be a featured speaker for the faculty at UCI Medical Center and, as a result, she attracted scientists that helped her create the Foundation and serve to this day on the Board of Directors. It is the Foundation’s hope that the research will show proof that the amazing outcomes are real and can become a new tool for other therapists to utilize so that these fast and effective non-invasive results that can become available to everyone. Her passion is that her mission will be fulfilled in her lifetime, as time is of the essence, and this system will create a happier and more successful world for all people in future generations, so that they don’t have to suffer like previous generations. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How will the community benefit when case study results are published?</strong></p>
<p>Depression is a serious condition that can impact many areas of someone’s life. It affects social life, relationships, career, and sense of self-worth. For women in particular, depression is common. According to the National Mental Health Association, about one in every eight women will develop depression at some point during her lifetime.</p>
<p>Through research conducted by this Foundation, our hope is to provide a viable choice for larger numbers of women to have an opportunity to reduce their depression and anxiety in a very short time without the use of drugs or long-term therapy.</p>
<p>Dr. Sidman was encouraged to form this foundation so that her life's work of accessing the subconscious mind directly can be a positive contribution in order to create a ""gold standard"" in the field of psychological treatment, therefore becoming a worthwhile alternative for the medical community to naturally restore the health of millions of people.</p>
<p><strong>Why depression?</strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""image"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1352.photobucket.com/albums/q650/Stephanie_Cw_Van_Brandest/depressionimage_zps0c719517.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Depression limits people from leading a fulfilling life. It can lead to many health issues, including weight issues, alcohol addiction, insomnia, heart disease, and other medical illness. In the United States, about 15 million people experience depression each year and the majority of them are women. Nearly two-thirds do not get the help they need, and depression carries a high risk of suicide.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any proof yet?</strong></p>
<p>Results have already been published in The Journal of Reproductive Medicine in 2009 for this short-term drug-free technique (STSH or Short-Term Sidman Hypnotherapy) healing an intractable disease called Interstitial Cystitis that was anxiety based. This is the premier OB/GYN journal in the world, and there has never been a cure for this disease until this method, so this case was notable enough for publication in this highly respected journal. The far-reaching application of this work can help relieve anxiety and stress-related illnesses, as well.</p>
<p>Our first study protocol has already been approved by the IRB, (the Institutional Review Board), showing no harm will come to human subjects. This first controlled study will compare STSH technique with medications that have side-effects and “black-box” warnings. This technique is natural with no side-effects and has shown long-lasting results. The Foundation plans to employ a significant number of employees to conduct this study.</p>
<p>In a preliminary pilot study using STSH, with a small group of individuals, conducted by the Foundation, results were proven through testing that all individuals in the study reduced their depression and anxiety from high to minimal levels without the use of medication within six sessions.</p>
<p>In the proposed study, a large number of people in three separate groups will be compared thereby showing control groups to prove the hypothesis. One group will be only on medication; the second group will be on medication and also be treated with STSH, and the third group will only experience the STSH treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Why contribute? What are you being helpful for?</strong></p>
<p>As a result of the preliminary study, it has been proven that STSH is incredibly effective, fast and safe. However, due to financial constraints, we are not able to get the study published or conduct the larger control-group study, and need your help in order to be funded so that we can make this treatment available to large numbers of people.</p>
<p><strong>How will you contribute?</strong></p>
<p>The disbursement of your contributions will be allocated for:</p>
<ul>
<li>advertisements for personnel, including their training</li>
<li>office space</li>
<li>furniture</li>
<li>equipment and supplies</li>
<li>subjects to participate in the study</li>
<li>interviews and testing,</li>
<li>transportation</li>
<li>insurances</li>
<li>primary investigators and other staff</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise a total of $300,000 in order to conduct the proposed research study that will take 2 years to complete.</p>
<p><strong>What will you get?</strong></p>
<p>Each contribution will receive a letter of appreciation from The Jacqueline Sidman Foundation.</p>
<p>Particular bigger amounts ($100 and above) will be listed on different special levels of recognition divided to ranges on our Health Foundation website (<strong>Bronze, Silver, Gold, Premium, Platinum</strong> and<strong> Diamond</strong> level contributor)</p>

Depression limits people from leading a fulfilling life. It can lead to many health issues, including weight issues, alcohol addiction, insomnia, heart disease, and other medical illness. In the United States, about 15 million people experience depression each year and the majority of them are women. Nearly two-thirds do not get the help they need, and depression carries a high risk of suicide.
Is there any proof yet?
Results have already been published in The Journal of Reproductive Medicine in 2009 for this short-term drug-free technique (STSH or Short-Term Sidman Hypnotherapy) healing an intractable disease called Interstitial Cystitis that was anxiety based. This is the premier OB/GYN journal in the world, and there has never been a cure for this disease until this method, so this case was notable enough for publication in this highly respected journal. The far-reaching application of this work can help relieve anxiety and stress-related illnesses, as well.
Our first study protocol has already been approved by the IRB, (the Institutional Review Board), showing no harm will come to human subjects. This first controlled study will compare STSH technique with medications that have side-effects and “black-box” warnings. This technique is natural with no side-effects and has shown long-lasting results. The Foundation plans to employ a significant number of employees to conduct this study.
In a preliminary pilot study using STSH, with a small group of individuals, conducted by the Foundation, results were proven through testing that all individuals in the study reduced their depression and anxiety from high to minimal levels without the use of medication within six sessions.
In the proposed study, a large number of people in three separate groups will be compared thereby showing control groups to prove the hypothesis. One group will be only on medication; the second group will be on medication and also be treated with STSH, and the third group will only experience the STSH treatment.
Why contribute? What are you being helpful for?
As a result of the preliminary study, it has been proven that STSH is incredibly effective, fast and safe. However, due to financial constraints, we are not able to get the study published or conduct the larger control-group study, and need your help in order to be funded so that we can make this treatment available to large numbers of people.
How will you contribute?
The disbursement of your contributions will be allocated for:

advertisements for personnel, including their training
office space
furniture
equipment and supplies
subjects to participate in the study
interviews and testing,
transportation
insurances
primary investigators and other staff
 
Our goal is to raise a total of $300,000 in order to conduct the proposed research study that will take 2 years to complete.
What will you get?
Each contribution will receive a letter of appreciation from The Jacqueline Sidman Foundation.
Particular bigger amounts ($100 and above) will be listed on different special levels of recognition divided to ranges on our Health Foundation website (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Premium, Platinum and Diamond level contributor)

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">My Story: 7 Scoliosis Surgeries </span></strong></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">    I was officially diagnosed with serve Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (S curve) and Kyphosis at age 11. When I first heard that I might even have Scoliosis I was so scared. Scoliosis is an abnormal curving of the spine. Your spine is your backbone. It runs straight down your back. Everyone’s spine naturally curves a tiny bit. But people with scoliosis have a spine that curves too much. The spine might look like the letter “C” or “S.” Kyphosis is a curving of the spine that causes a bowing or rounding of the back, which leads to a hunchback or slouching posture.<br/><br/></span></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.myscoliosisstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Scoliosis4pic-e1328255813981.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><div style=""text-align: left;"">We went to my doctors and they did the standard Scoliosis Screening Test then I started treatment in San Diego, California at USNMC Balboa. I wore a TLSO Brace or Boston Brace for 23 hours a day. I could only take it off for middle school gym class. I felt I could hide my biggest flaw 95% of the time but there is no hiding the giant plastic corset when your changing into sweats. To add to my distress of all the changes to my body, I had to bring my bace to the office because it did not fit into my locker.</div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""> After wearing the brace religiously for a year my curve was still progressing. I was very scared when they sent me to have a MRI and a CT Scan. There was no way around it I needed surgery, my spine was so twisted and bent it was crushing my lungs, making it hard to breathe and inching closer to twisting around my heart.<br/> My first fusion surgery, with Harrington rods occurred in December 2000. I was in the hospital’s ICU for 2 days and then moved to the regular ward for 4 days. The surgery was deemed as a success. <br/> My spine was good for the first few years then I had increased pain which led me back to the doctors where it was discovered that I had pseudarthosis in my spine and my spine was not fully fused. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">In 2005 I had my second surgery where my rods were removed, but they did not replace my rods right away hoping that the half of my spine that was fused would hold the curve and I would not need a third surgery. However, six months later my curves were getting worse and we planned my third surgery. I was placed in traction and a halo for a week to “stretch me” they replaced my rods and added screws while also preforming a spine lateral release.  During my many different forms of treatment for My Scoliosis I also had other complications inducing:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Acquired Hip Dysplasia</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Chronic Kidney Stones</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Chronic Osteomyelitis</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Collapsed Lungs</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Dermatitis</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Depression</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Femorocetabluar Impingement (FAI)</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Stomach ulcers</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Upper Respiratory Infections</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">    In 2008 my spine was “falling forward” and I had increased pain therefore my rods were removed and it was discovered that infection of Osteomyelitis was present. I was given a PIC line for another year, and braced with a TSLO Brace. In 2009 I had my last surgeries at USCD by Thornton. He did the first surgery to make sure no infection was present even though my tests were clear. Then the next surgery was to replace my rods. I am now fully fused from T3-L3 and nearly two years post opt. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">    Throughout my twisted journey I battled not only medical difficulties, but myself. There was a time in my life when I was not the positive, upbeat Scoliosis Girl I am today. I was bullied, made fun of and shun for my disorder, a disorder I did not choose. I felt alone and hopeless but through time and healing I have found that I’m so much more then a curved spine.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">     Since being diagnosed with Scoliosis I educated myself as much as possible and quickly learned that scoliosis was a disease that tends to be diagnosed in pre-teen years in 1 in 40 kids. It is treated with a range of strategies that includes braces, physical therapies, and invasive spine surgeries. Along the way, kids with scoliosis frequently face challenges such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Physical discomfort and pain resulting from scoliosis and/or bracing</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Self-consciousness around body image and braces</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Avoidance of embarrassing situations where the secret of the brace or body deformity might be exposed</span></li>
<li class=""li3""><span class=""s1"">Fears of facing major reconstructive surgery</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><br/> Since learning and dealing with my own feelings of loneliness and a struggle for acceptance this I founded my own Scoliosis Awareness site <a href=""http://www.myscoliosisstory.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""s2"">My Scoliosis Story</span></a> and became the Chapter Director of the Curvy Girls of Southern Califorina.  Scoliosis is my passion because I believe it’s my personal mission  to spread awareness about Scoliosis and provided a message of empowerment to all those effected by this disorder.</span></p>

    I was officially diagnosed with serve Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (S curve) and Kyphosis at age 11. When I first heard that I might even have Scoliosis I was so scared. Scoliosis is an abnormal curving of the spine. Your spine is your backbone. It runs straight down your back. Everyone’s spine naturally curves a tiny bit. But people with scoliosis have a spine that curves too much. The spine might look like the letter “C” or “S.” Kyphosis is a curving of the spine that causes a bowing or rounding of the back, which leads to a hunchback or slouching posture.

We went to my doctors and they did the standard Scoliosis Screening Test then I started treatment in San Diego, California at USNMC Balboa. I wore a TLSO Brace or Boston Brace for 23 hours a day. I could only take it off for middle school gym class. I felt I could hide my biggest flaw 95% of the time but there is no hiding the giant plastic corset when your changing into sweats. To add to my distress of all the changes to my body, I had to bring my bace to the office because it did not fit into my locker.

 
 After wearing the brace religiously for a year my curve was still progressing. I was very scared when they sent me to have a MRI and a CT Scan. There was no way around it I needed surgery, my spine was so twisted and bent it was crushing my lungs, making it hard to breathe and inching closer to twisting around my heart. My first fusion surgery, with Harrington rods occurred in December 2000. I was in the hospital’s ICU for 2 days and then moved to the regular ward for 4 days. The surgery was deemed as a success.  My spine was good for the first few years then I had increased pain which led me back to the doctors where it was discovered that I had pseudarthosis in my spine and my spine was not fully fused. 
In 2005 I had my second surgery where my rods were removed, but they did not replace my rods right away hoping that the half of my spine that was fused would hold the curve and I would not need a third surgery. However, six months later my curves were getting worse and we planned my third surgery. I was placed in traction and a halo for a week to “stretch me” they replaced my rods and added screws while also preforming a spine lateral release.  During my many different forms of treatment for My Scoliosis I also had other complications inducing:

Acquired Hip Dysplasia
Chronic Kidney Stones
Chronic Osteomyelitis
Collapsed Lungs
Dermatitis
Depression
Femorocetabluar Impingement (FAI)
Stomach ulcers
Upper Respiratory Infections

    In 2008 my spine was “falling forward” and I had increased pain therefore my rods were removed and it was discovered that infection of Osteomyelitis was present. I was given a PIC line for another year, and braced with a TSLO Brace. In 2009 I had my last surgeries at USCD by Thornton. He did the first surgery to make sure no infection was present even though my tests were clear. Then the next surgery was to replace my rods. I am now fully fused from T3-L3 and nearly two years post opt. 
    Throughout my twisted journey I battled not only medical difficulties, but myself. There was a time in my life when I was not the positive, upbeat Scoliosis Girl I am today. I was bullied, made fun of and shun for my disorder, a disorder I did not choose. I felt alone and hopeless but through time and healing I have found that I’m so much more then a curved spine.
     Since being diagnosed with Scoliosis I educated myself as much as possible and quickly learned that scoliosis was a disease that tends to be diagnosed in pre-teen years in 1 in 40 kids. It is treated with a range of strategies that includes braces, physical therapies, and invasive spine surgeries. Along the way, kids with scoliosis frequently face challenges such as:

Physical discomfort and pain resulting from scoliosis and/or bracing
Self-consciousness around body image and braces
Avoidance of embarrassing situations where the secret of the brace or body deformity might be exposed
Fears of facing major reconstructive surgery

 Since learning and dealing with my own feelings of loneliness and a struggle for acceptance this I founded my own Scoliosis Awareness site My Scoliosis Story and became the Chapter Director of the Curvy Girls of Southern Califorina.  Scoliosis is my passion because I believe it’s my personal mission  to spread awareness about Scoliosis and provided a message of empowerment to all those effected by this disorder.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><font size=""3"">Hey. My name is Adam Payne and I am a Leo. I am also a cancer-free, hair growing person. I have never had cancer, but I have experienced it up-close with my friends and with my immediate family. It sucks. I have spent most of my life trying to be the funny guy and make light of the darkest situations; but cancer, cancer sucks.  Cancer, and Breast Cancer in particular, has always been one of those subjects that, for the life of me, I just can't make funny. I can't write a song about it. I can't intimidate it with dance, and I can't punch it into oblivion. Well, I probably could use my super-human strength and punch it into oblivion, but you know Cancer is a sneaky mutha and would just come back from remission. </font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">I have played music out of the Athens area for 14 years now and in that time; I have played quite a few charitable concerts. I have donated money to American Cancer Society and I have donated three long pony-tails to Locks for Love. I have been asked/ dared to shave my head and in the process raise $500 for BreastFest Athens. This is a dare that I do not take lightly, because as you know, when a musician cuts his hair, he cuts his talent as well...   After very little thought, I have decided that I WILL have my head shaved at BreastFest on March 24 2012, along with the other brave souls that have agreed to do the same. I have started this campaign simply because I know that I have a lot of friends that have been affected by Breast Cancer. I also know that I have a full-time job and have never openly asked any of my friends to give to anything, ever. <font color=""#cc0099"">I'm asking now.</font></font></p>

Friends of David Sheker AKA CinderVOMIT have started this campaign to raise funds after a series of unfortunate medical mishaps left him with massive bills to pay. Please contribute whatever you can using the big pink button on the right and enjoy some great music in the process!
What happened?
Cinder suffered a “diverticulotis” that ruptured his intestines causing poison and bacteria to spread through his system, almost killing him in the process. Surgeons removed 14 inches of his intestines and Cinder was forced to use a colostomy bag while healing from this initial operation. He has since had to endure additional surgery on his stomach. Although his prognosis is good, this father of two has been saddled with medical bills in excess of $40,000!
Community response
Several groups have formed benefit programs for Cinder. Among them are Akashik Record’s Help Cinder site (also on Facebook) and the JellyFish Frequency Records series of benefit compilations. All of the offerings available through these projects will be provided for supporters of this campaign as well.

</p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This past year we conducted a case
study for people with Parkinson’s with promising results.</b><br/></p>
<p>I am a neuroendocrine researcher focusing on
neurodegenerative issues such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>I got a call December 11th from one of the participants in our
case studies on Parkinson’s that we started this past April.  </p>
<p>She said, “<b><i>Now I really have hope and feel I’m not
dying from it</i></b>.”  </p>
<p>A month ago another participant told his doctor, “<b><i>Thanks
for giving me my life back</i></b>.”  </p>
<p>They and others have been taking a set of our
non-prescription neuropeptoide formulas for Parkinson’s that I had been researching and
developing since 2009.  </p>
<p><b>Now we need to
conduct a nationwide clinical study.</b></p>
<p>This feedback in addition to the quantifiable results (please see the end here and visit our <a href=""http://www.ParkinsonsSolution.com)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ParkinsonsSolution.com)</a> from our review of symptoms forms are confirming a steady
decrease in symptoms of the participants with Parkinson’s, and with no adverse
side effects reported.</p>
<p>Now we need to take it to the next stage and do a nationwide
clinical study with at least 100 participants whose doctors recommend them.</p>
<p><b>We were able to pay
for all of the development costs and the case study, but now request your help
for this nation-wide study.</b></p>
<p>Until now I have had to pay for everything out-of-pocket, but with
these promising results proving the potential value of our formulas, we need to
do a nationwide clinical study with at least 100 participants for 6 months, and then publish a paper of our results.</p>
<p><b>All the monies received
will apply to conducting a nationwide clinical study starting January, 2015.</b></p>
<p>All of the monies received will be used to cover formula
costs for the participants and expenses associated with conducting this study.  For example, just mailing costs for bottles twice to
100 participants by priority mail is: 100 x $5.80 x 2 = $1060, and receiving the doctors’ reports once a month =
100 x 6 x $0.46 = $276.</p>
<p>The amount we hope to receive is $68,000.  The more money received, the more people with
Parkinson’s we can enroll in this no-cost study to them.  </p>
<p><b>Many people are
suffering and the urgency is growing.</b></p>
<p>With over 1,000,000 Americans afflicted with this debilitating,
deadly disease and no curative treatments available, the need for our study is
crucial.  </p>
<p>The study materials are already developed.  </p>
<p>Doctors from whom we will receive participant referrals are
being brought together.  </p>
<p>With your support we plan to start this 6-month study by the
end of January, 2015.</p>
<p><b>Please make a
contribution to our study.</b></p>
<p>I am turning to you to see if you could please help and</p>
<p>(1) make a donation of however much you can and </p>
<p>(2) share this information with your friends, family, and
associates.</p>
<p>Please also check out our little affiliated website we set
up for this study: <a href=""http://www.parkinsonssolution.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ParkinsonsSolution.com</a>
so that you will be able to stay informed and watch the progress of our study.  To get regular updates on our research findings and participant feedback, please 'like' us on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ParkinsonsSolution"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/ParkinsonsSolution</a>. </p>
<p>Any amount you can contribute, (perhaps at least $20.15 to commemorate the coming year?), will be deeply appreciated by us and especially those afflicted by Parkinson's.  While we don’t have rewards or gifts, please know that you will be a very
important part of this ground-breaking research project and kept up-to-date as the study progresses.</p>
<p><b>Hearth-felt thanks
from us and those with Parkinson’s</b></p>
<p>Thank you so very much for your donation and may you have a
blessed Holiday Season and 2015 year.</p>

clinical study with at least 100 participants whose doctors recommend them.
We were able to pay
for all of the development costs and the case study, but now request your help
for this nation-wide study.
Until now I have had to pay for everything out-of-pocket, but with
these promising results proving the potential value of our formulas, we need to
do a nationwide clinical study with at least 100 participants for 6 months, and then publish a paper of our results.
All the monies received
will apply to conducting a nationwide clinical study starting January, 2015.
All of the monies received will be used to cover formula
costs for the participants and expenses associated with conducting this study.  For example, just mailing costs for bottles twice to
100 participants by priority mail is: 100 x $5.80 x 2 = $1060, and receiving the doctors’ reports once a month =
100 x 6 x $0.46 = $276.
The amount we hope to receive is $68,000.  The more money received, the more people with
Parkinson’s we can enroll in this no-cost study to them.  
Many people are
suffering and the urgency is growing.
With over 1,000,000 Americans afflicted with this debilitating,
deadly disease and no curative treatments available, the need for our study is
crucial.  
The study materials are already developed.  
Doctors from whom we will receive participant referrals are
being brought together.  
With your support we plan to start this 6-month study by the
end of January, 2015.
Please make a
contribution to our study.
I am turning to you to see if you could please help and
(1) make a donation of however much you can and 
(2) share this information with your friends, family, and
associates.
Please also check out our little affiliated website we set
up for this study: www.ParkinsonsSolution.com
so that you will be able to stay informed and watch the progress of our study.  To get regular updates on our research findings and participant feedback, please 'like' us on https://www.facebook.com/ParkinsonsSolution. 
Any amount you can contribute, (perhaps at least $20.15 to commemorate the coming year?), will be deeply appreciated by us and especially those afflicted by Parkinson's.  While we don’t have rewards or gifts, please know that you will be a very
important part of this ground-breaking research project and kept up-to-date as the study progresses.
Hearth-felt thanks
from us and those with Parkinson’s
Thank you so very much for your donation and may you have a
blessed Holiday Season and 2015 year.
My best to your good health,

 In addition to the Review of
Symptoms form documentation, these quotes are unsolicited
feedback from the participants.
Report
May 1st at 1 month …..   “The other day (husband) told me he
thought both his handwriting and his  
gait were better. Cautiously optimistic.”

Report
Jun 27th at 3 months ….. “I'm
already seeing results from the sprays which I am grateful to you for.   
* full restful sleep without waking (went on for
years)
* no more nightmares of people and animals
trying to kill me   
 * no more
constipation (went on for years)
* no more head tremor
* no more leg cramps (went on for years)
* less severe anxiety and mild depression (went
on for years)
     
      (all physiological domains are
better …)
* better memory and mood
Overall--my ""cylinders"" are running together which gives
me the ability to function better.  One huge motor symptom that has not
reoccurred is a head tremor.  I had a head
tremor going all the time for four months without medication until I started
taking levadopa.  Even when I'm
unmedicated, the head tremor is gone for good now!  I attribute this motor change to your sprays.
Report
July 10th at 3 months ..…“I had no trouble buttoning my blouse this morning.  I
was very happy    about
that.”
Report
Aug 1st at 4 months:  ….. “I had lunch with my daughter today and she said, ""mom I  think you are   walking
better and swinging your arms better too"". So that is very good  
news.”

Report
Aug 21st at 4 months:  ….. “Thanks for giving me my life back.” 

 Report Aug 25th at 5 months:  ….. “I keep improving, but still shake – more in
the evenings.”

Report Oct 8, 2014 at 7 months:  ….. ""I want to take a little time to thank both of
you for the work you are  doing.  I
just returned from my neurologist, and the disease is at the very least slowing
down in its progression.  In fact, I think it has stopped at least for now
and a number of my symptoms have even improved! 

When I was first diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease at the age of
41, I was on one hand very happy to finally be diagnosed correctly after a
tough diagnostic process.  I was diagnosed in Stage 2 Parkinson's in Feb.
of 2012, and I'm still in stage 2 today.  After six months, I was scared
when I finally knew what I was dealing with.  I'm not scared any more.
 With your permission, I would like to continue the sprays indefinitely.
 I think they are the only hope I have to at least slow down, stop, or
even improve the disease along with regular exercise, a proper diet, staying active
and positive, and prayer. 
There is nothing else out there like your sprays.  I am so
grateful to you, and so is my family.  I have three kids to finish raising
and work that I want to keep doing.  I
will do anything to advocate for you and let others know how much your sprays
have helped me.  I want to keep going!""

<p></p>
<p>Allairgoo  is designed to help <b>Everyone</b> who wants to live better, who wants healthier lives in a more and more polluted environment. Well informed you will suffer less and adapt your behavior to stay healthy. </p>
<p>Allairgoo is designed to help every one, to understand what means technical information about pollution , AQI, µg/m3 of Ozone on their wealth. Without need of engineering or scientific degrees or wikipedia.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Allairgoo (TM) is a project that consists of a system of personalized alerts for allergy and asthma sufferers and ignorant victims of pollution episodes more frequent in OECD countries and south-west Asia, main Chinese cities…</p>
<p>Example: in New Zealand , one in four kid before 10 years  <a href=""http://asthmafoundation.org.nz/your-health/living-with-asthma/asthma-in-new-zealand/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>became</b></a> asthmatic in Auckland following episodes of pollution. While the country has beautiful scenery for the Hollywood productions .</p>
<p>22 million allergic, 5 million asthmatics in France undergo episodes of air pollution at the same time and sometimes trigger new allergies (studies about PM role in allergic development). Their daily life (or night) and their work are then hit in a different way according to their level of sensitivity  or reaction to pollutant (PM, NOx, Ozone). </p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>The problems are identical for people in the USA, UE, biggest cities in China…</b> It affects children, young adults, adults, old people.</p>
<p>They do not have simple alerts despite existing technologies and no comprehensible system of alert and responsive to the needs of each.

Allairgoo: Air pollution & Pollen alerts



The air pollution is an increasingly important issue in developed countries. Everyone looks at CO2 and climate while other problems exist and involve a larger number of people breathing a polluted air by particles and gases produced by cars, industries.
In fact on some places, Not all air is good for breathing ! 
Air pollution causes cancer.  Just have look at this map that shows the premature mortality due to air pollution:




source : Nasa study.


Asthma is the most common chronic disease that affects Americans of all ages, about 40 million people . Asthmatic people are affected by this pollution, and must take care. To achieve this, they have to be informed correctly at time and adapt their behavior.. Sometimes for days.




Allairgoo  is designed to help Everyone who wants to live better, who wants healthier lives in a more and more polluted environment. Well informed you will suffer less and adapt your behavior to stay healthy. 
Allairgoo is designed to help every one, to understand what means technical information about pollution , AQI, µg/m3 of Ozone on their wealth. Without need of engineering or scientific degrees or wikipedia.


Allairgoo (TM) is a project that consists of a system of personalized alerts for allergy and asthma sufferers and ignorant victims of pollution episodes more frequent in OECD countries and south-west Asia, main Chinese cities…
Example: in New Zealand , one in four kid before 10 years  became asthmatic in Auckland following episodes of pollution. While the country has beautiful scenery for the Hollywood productions .
22 million allergic, 5 million asthmatics in France undergo episodes of air pollution at the same time and sometimes trigger new allergies (studies about PM role in allergic development). Their daily life (or night) and their work are then hit in a different way according to their level of sensitivity  or reaction to pollutant (PM, NOx, Ozone). 


The problems are identical for people in the USA, UE, biggest cities in China… It affects children, young adults, adults, old people.
They do not have simple alerts despite existing technologies and no comprehensible system of alert and responsive to the needs of each. Each of you does not answer, or react the same way than another. (UK Study 2009) 

Covered cities in the USA:




We have the same coverage for Europe, Australia and China, Singapour, Hong-Kong.


China:



Australia 




 Europe (at launch time, more cities to come)






DESIGNED FOR :

Allergic, asthmatics.
Quantified self gurus
sportsman, sportswomen, athletes, trainers : most of them ignore that running or training under bad (and invisible) conditions is dangerous for their health.
parents who want to protect their children : ""Parent"" version for parents who want to alert their children.

We offer a simple solution via their smartphone: a subscription to a PERSONALIZED alert service with a low cost : 12€/year or 15 US $ .
With Allairgoo, you can choose when you receive notification alerts. 

It therefore concerns the preservation of health by allowing customers and users to change their behavior if the episode level concerns them . It is about getting older healthy as these problems affect henceforth ages people and affect life expectancy . Allairgoo plays on the well-being of all including sportsperson and well-being at home, and allows adjustment of lifestyle and hygienic behaviors.
Based on public data (1000 cities available about 800 millions of adults payers , and based on european or US medical estimations : 200 millions of potential users ) via proprietary algorithms we define a personalized threshold for each client: Empowerment and quantize yourself!
The more you use Allairgoo the more the algorithm learns about you.
All in a simple ergonomics user interface comparable to that of an application comparable to a weather-like app with a pedagogy of events , a small  number of screens, a ""free"" mode apparently not limited in terms of functionalities . 
This a freemium model. The free app offers all the functionalities , the customer registers , creates his account on our platform, is informed  on public thresholds & pollution alerts or pollen alerts (on larger zone) . The software will determine its personal threshold . 
But this personal threshold is not saved on the iPhone/android ( paid version only ), and the free version will lack of some other internal functionalities. And you will be alerted even if you move to another country (holidays, work), city covered by our service.
Allairgoo will alert you on your iPhone/Android phone at the time you want. 
People should be able to use Allairgoo easily and immediately, without training and without reading a user manual.
For this, the only device you need is a recent smatphone (IOS, Android) , no box, no über-modern watch on you, no home device.. and you.
But for people in zone where no datas are available or not available for the public, We will also sell a device for the customer that provides the level of PM10/PM2.5 micro-particles ( dust ) and ozone / nitrogen oxides at home, work, or any place where the device is installed  (even outside with additional furniture  ). 
Target price : 120  to 150 € (internal model)
It connects to the LAN of the client, and will need a PC / Mac or tablet / smartphone that enables it to manage and archive the datas and send them on a centralized server, which among other displays Google Map software. It will user OS/X or windows possibility of "" alerting "" or notifications of any kind , and on some DSL/Fiber devices/boxes and use the possibility to send messages on the screen of the TV or directly on the connected IP TV .
It is conceived to use a little bandwidth payload so it can be connected thru 2G network, edge connexions.
Target : power users, data gurus, open data revolutionaries, rural zones, low developed countries.
Key features
Logging : anonymous datas, no spam, full UE regulatory compliant.
LANGUAGE
Software will be available in English, French, Chinese and Spanish.

<p> </p>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p>My name is Chordale Booker.  I am 21 years old and have been pursing my dream for 3 years now.  Boxing has had a positive influence on me.  I don’t think that I would be where I am today if it wasn’t for boxing. </p>
<p>Before I began my boxing career, I ran into some trouble with the police.  It was definitely a down point in my life and I believe it was then that I realized that I needed to change, which is when I turned to boxing. Starting boxing was one of the best decisions I could have made in my life.  </p>
<p>I began training with the RF Youth Boxing Program in Oct. 2009.  Boxing has always been something I was interested in despite my basketball career in high school.  When I realized that this was truly my passion and something that I wanted to pursue, it became my main focus.  I was in the gym day and night trying to master what I learned that day in class.  This is when Ahmad Mickens, Revolution Fitness owner, took a particular interest in me.  He noticed that I was working really hard and began training me himself.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>My Trainer</strong></h3>
<p>I look at Ahmad as a role model and father figure today. My father passed away prior to me starting boxing and Ahmad definitely helped me overcome that challenge. He was someone who despite my background believed in me.  He believed in me, more than I believed in myself at times.  He pushed me beyond my limits with his unconditional support. He taught me how to be disciplined and coachable.  We have built a relationship based on trust, respect, hard-work, and dedication; a relationship that has allowed us to become a winning team.  Since then I have graduated from the RF Youth Program and have become a certified boxing coach and personal trainer.  <strong> </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>My Accomplishments</strong></h3>
<p>Although I have had a short boxing career, I must say I am really proud of how far I have come. I have won many championships including The Elite Heat Championship, The Adidas Pal Championship, The Pure Breed Championship, The Long Island Championship, Connecticut and New England Golden Glove Championships.  Winning all of those championships boosted my confidence and made me really ambitious. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>My Setback</strong></h3>
<p>Everything was going great for me until I fought at Revolution Fitness's annual Fall Fisticuffs on November 24, 2012.  It was the first time I fought in my city in a long time and I was excited. During the second round of my fight I broke my ankle and had to forfeit the fight.  It was just so depressing; competing in my city and this happens? I was filled with mixed emotions and could only hope for the best.  I was rushed to the emergency room to find out that I needed surgery and had to be out of the gym for two months.  The recovery process was difficult at first. I was in physical pain but, the mental anguish of not being able to do what I love most was worse.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>My Comeback</strong></h3>
<p>I knew that the best thing I could do was try to fully recover, so that I could box at my highest potential again. Once I came back my motto was ""NO PAIN NO GAIN!""  I was training harder than ever for my first fight back, after my injury at the Olympic Center in Lake Placid, NY.  All of my hard work paid off when I won and became the Northeast Region 1 Champion.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What's NEXT</strong></h3>
<p>NEXT are the Nationals in Washington State! We are asking for everyone's help to raise $3,000 to cover the cost of the trip.  Region 1 has paid for most of my expenses, but none of my coach's expenses.  Ahmad coaches me at no charge, while running a gym and providing for his family. A week away for the gym and the cost of traveling to the Nationals will definitely put a strain on his business. Not only is he my boxing coach but, he is my life coach and his presence is crucial for my success. </p>

Everything was going great for me until I fought at Revolution Fitness's annual Fall Fisticuffs on November 24, 2012.  It was the first time I fought in my city in a long time and I was excited. During the second round of my fight I broke my ankle and had to forfeit the fight.  It was just so depressing; competing in my city and this happens? I was filled with mixed emotions and could only hope for the best.  I was rushed to the emergency room to find out that I needed surgery and had to be out of the gym for two months.  The recovery process was difficult at first. I was in physical pain but, the mental anguish of not being able to do what I love most was worse.
 
My Comeback
I knew that the best thing I could do was try to fully recover, so that I could box at my highest potential again. Once I came back my motto was ""NO PAIN NO GAIN!""  I was training harder than ever for my first fight back, after my injury at the Olympic Center in Lake Placid, NY.  All of my hard work paid off when I won and became the Northeast Region 1 Champion.  
 
What's NEXT
NEXT are the Nationals in Washington State! We are asking for everyone's help to raise $3,000 to cover the cost of the trip.  Region 1 has paid for most of my expenses, but none of my coach's expenses.  Ahmad coaches me at no charge, while running a gym and providing for his family. A week away for the gym and the cost of traveling to the Nationals will definitely put a strain on his business. Not only is he my boxing coach but, he is my life coach and his presence is crucial for my success. 
If you never chase your dreams, you will never catch them and we need your support.

</h3> <p>  It was a snowy day in March of 2007. There was over a foot of snow in the driveway and none of us could get out to go to work. The van got stuck and we burned out the transmission rocking it back and forth. The other car made it out of the driveway but slid into the ditch in front of the house. Needless to say none of us where going to able to get to work.</p>
<p>  When I got back into into the house my chest was fealing full. I thought I had a case of bronchitis because I was out in the cold so long (a couple of hours). We did manage to get my car out and I drove to a nearby clinic.</p>
<p>  At the clinic they took me in right away. They said you don't have bronchitis you are having a heart attack. Off to the hospital they rushed me. On the operating table... I died. They had to use the defibrillator 5 times to get me going again.</p>
<p>  That was over seven years ago and I have come a long way, by the grace of God, to a much healthier me. From barely being able to walk 50 feet with out having to catch my breath to being able to run errands, can walk around WalMart for hours shopping with no problem. Have lost weight, quit eating junk food, stop drinking diet-Pepsi (I was drinking over 8 to 10 20oz per day). Now I eat healthy food every day and all my Doctors say I am doing great keep up the good work.</p>

My name is John Kirst and that is my story.
My goals for this campaign are:



To purchase a new or used computer with Windows 7 or 8 so I can work at home. Most telecommuting jobs require that you have a upgraded system. My current system is Windows XP on a slower computer. I cannot work at a 9 to 5 punch the time clock type job quite yet. 

By earning more I can come off social security and give more to people who need help. There are a lot of people here at Indiegogo as well as other organizations that need help. I will Pay it Forward 

  

What the Funds Will Be Used For The first $500 raised will used to replace my computer. I am currently running Windows XP and this computer cannot be upgraded to Windows 7 or 8. Being on social security income there not a lot of room in the budget for extras. So being able work with a Windows 7 or 8 computer will enable me to work from home thus getting off social security.
Any funds above the $500 will be greatly appreciated and will be used to help support the American Heart Association and My Fellow Indiegogoens in their campaign quests... Pay It Forward.

<p>Hi, my name is Allison and I am raising money to donate a<br/>Gift That Takes Flight through Stars Air Ambulance for my best friend's dad who<br/>was recently transported with them. As Stars runs solely on donations I am<br/>hoping to raise enough donations to cover the cost of an average flight. Once we fund a flight, they will send a certificate of support and the information about the emergency response. It will mean a lot to me to know that we could help fund a flight to help someone else like they helped my best friend’s dad.</p>
<p>The average cost of a flight is $5,400, and every donation<br/>is going to Stars, for a gift that takes flight. </p>
<p>Donations made to Stars enables them to be ready 24 hours a<br/>day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help anyone in need, with 3 bases in<br/>Alberta 2 in Saskatchewan and one in Manitoba. </p>

<h2>CPAP Horizon Project is a Professional Alliance of CPAP Therapy Providers, Sleep Physicians, and Sleep Professionals</h2>
<h3>Our Primary Goal Is To Improve The Overall Effectiveness And Sustainability Of CPAP Therapy In The United States</h3>
<p><strong>CPAP Horizon Project started with one simple question...</strong></p>
</center>
<p><strong>What if, with a few improvements, and the right resources, Clinicians and Therapy Providers could easily work together to deliver the highest standard of care, while at the same time, improving the health and sustainability of their own businesses and practices?</strong></p>
<p>We all know there is a better way... and members of the CPAP Horizon Project alliance are creating it together.</p>

<h2>We have a growing list of member benefits in the pipeline, but let's focus on what is available to you right now.</h2>
<p>CPAP Horizon Project members enjoy unlimited use of...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Horizon Protocols</strong> -- standardized, tested and optimized CPAP patient follow-up protocols (plus a free automated follow-up system)</li>
<li>
<strong>ManageMyCPAP basic</strong> -- an automated, interactive patient follow-up, support, and tracking application</li>
<li>
<strong>Horizon Exchange (HIE)</strong> -- Technology Integration and Data Sharing For All Stakeholders</li>
<li>
<strong>CHP Dashboard</strong> -- CPAP therapy metrics, benchmarking and analytics (""Big Data"" for CPAP therapy providers)</li>
<li>
<strong>Annual Outcomes Assessment Survey</strong> -- clinical follow-up with past patients to measure outcomes and identify re-evaluation candidates</li>
</ul>
<p>How's that for value?</p>
<p>We provide you with follow-up protocols, automated technology to 'run' those protocols, marketing support to attract more patients, and better ways of managing data and measuring outcomes... And we're just getting started!</p>
<p>Let me explain each of these member benefits separately, and I think you will agree that, through the CPAP Horizon Project alliance, we are solving the biggest issues facing CPAP therapy.</p>
<h2>The Horizon Protocols -- Standardized, Optimized CPAP Patient Follow-Up</h2>
<p>Consistent and timely short-term and long-term patient follow-up is critical. It is one of the most effective things you can do as a CPAP therapy provider to improve results.</p>
<p>For new patients, following up at several points during the first 30 days of therapy allows you to identify problems early and intervene to solve them.</p>
<p>For long-term patients, checking in several times a year has a big impact on patient satisfaction and overall outcomes. And again, if problems are identified, there is a good chance that they can be resolved, and the patient's therapy can get back on track.</p>
<p>There are, we can all agree, basic best practices that should be implemented for each patient. But, knowing (and proving) <strong>exactly</strong> what patient follow-up protocol is <strong>best</strong> requires an evidence-based, scientific approach.</p>
<p>Here's how CPAP Horizon Project helps our members manage their patients under the most effective follow-up protocol possible...</p>

<h2>ManageMyCPAP -- An Automated, Interactive Patient Follow-Up And Support Application</h2>
<p>We knew, when we started this project, that if we were going to have a measurable impact on the effectiveness of CPAP therapy in the United States, we needed a better, more cost effective way for CPAP Providers to follow-up with patients.</p>
<p>First, we planned to partner with an existing technology or service provider, but we quickly realized that if we wanted to have an effective solution, we were going to have to build it ourselves. Every existing solution was either too device/manufacturer-centric, mired down in old-school telephone technology, in poor financial condition, or missing critical patient-centric features.</p>
<p>Realizing that there was a gap between what was needed by our members and what was available in the market, we expanded the role of CPAP Horizon project to include acting as a technology incubator.</p>
<p>Through the CHP technology incubator, we provide the funding, guidance, support and resources to help technology projects get off the ground.</p>
<p>Our first project is ManageMyCPAP: <em>A Patient Follow-up and Support Application for CPAP Therapy Providers and Clinicians</em></p>
<center><img alt="""" border=""1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cpaphorizonproject.org/images/mmcp_logo_med_blue.png"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<p>ManageMyCPAP is a a web and mobile application that makes it possible to stay consistently in touch with a large pool of active patients without having to add more staff.</p>
<center><img alt="""" border=""1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cpaphorizonproject.org/images/2013-07-21_1116.png"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<p>ManageMyCPAP makes it easy to follow-up with patients through automated, interactive therapy checkups. After getting an email, text, or voice notification, patients simply log in and answer a few questions. If there are any issues that the CPAP Provider's staff should know about, they are alerted immediately.</p>
<center><img alt="""" border=""1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cpaphorizonproject.org/images/2013-07-21_1118.png"" src="""" style=""""/></center>

<h2>Horizon Exchange (HIE) -- Technology Integration and Data Sharing For All Stakeholders</h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenges standing in the way of improving the effectiveness of CPAP therapy is the ability to share data across all stakeholders in the CPAP continuum of care.</p>
<p>Starting in September of 2013, CPAP Horizon Project will begin providing a Health Information Exchange (HIE) service to it's members that provides a way for various technologies to talk to each other and helps eliminate redundant data entry.</p>
<h2>CHP Dashboard -- CPAP Therapy Metrics, Benchmarking And Analytics (""Big Data"" For CPAP Therapy Providers)</h2>
<p>One of the most critical elements of any business or therapeutic endeavor, is the ability to actually track and measure results. Unfortunately, CPAP therapy providers and clinicians often find themselves flying blind - without a good set of performance metrics.</p>
<p>We've got this 'new' concept in healthcare called 'big data' and there are a lot of discussions about the way it will transform markets. It's true, of course... in our market as well as all other healthcare markets, success is becoming more and more dependent on the ability to use data to improve efficiencies and outcomes.</p>
<p>In CPAP therapy, the challenge is mostly about defining an effective set of metrics that are accessible and available to every CPAP Provider and clinician.</p>
<p>Our members need measurements that show the health of their businesses and the effectiveness of the therapy they provide. Not just measurements developed by insurance companies, but rather, true performance metrics that our members can track over time.</p>
<p>Coming, in August of 2013, CPAP Horizon Project will begin providing our members with a simple, yet powerful, performance metrics dashboard. We'll give them an easy way to track key metrics and benchmark their results against member averages.</p>
<h3>Our members gain powerful insights through standardized performance metrics, such as...</h3>
<ul>
<li>patient satisfaction</li>
<li>adherence rate</li>
<li>therapy status (inactive, new, active, off therapy)</li>
<li>daytime sleepiness</li>
<li>snoring</li>
<li>orders per year per patient</li>
<li>counts by machine and mask</li>

<p><b>WHAT IS CHECKMYLEVEL?</b></p>
<p>It all started from horses. Our founder was studying race horses and noticed an interesting phenomena. Low-voltage electric current could be used to assess the recovery status of the horse. After a long period of research something completely new was born: The Checkmylevel Training Readiness and Recovery Monitor. It uses low-voltage current to stimulate your muscles and nerves, your peripheral nervous system to be exact.</p>
<p>And the result? The most accurate device to assess your recovery. And why is recovery important? As they say: train and get tired, rest and improve. </p>
<p>Checkmylevel includes a novel assessment device, smartphone app and reusable electrodes all included in the starter pack. Verify the tested smartphone models from our website.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>I was working a 6-figure job while obtaining a healthy lifestyle, what most people think is the ideal lifestyle to live.</p>
<p>But I wasn't content.</p>
<p>I wanted to <b>create something awesome.</b></p>
<p>I wanted to be an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>So I quit my job and sold everything I owned so that I could start a new business.</p>
<p>After moving to Europe to learn about business from successful friends, I noticed something peculiar - <b>People were eating cricket protein bars.</b></p>
<p>Coming from Manitoba, Canada, I found this... Interesting.</p>
<p>I looked up on why choose crickets over normal protein bars and I was BLOWN AWAY by the health benefits and sustainability of crickets over cattle (what most protein bars/powders are made of). </p>
<p><b>It really seemed too good to be true.</b></p>
<p>I wanted to give crickets a go, but unfortunately, I don't really eat protein bars.</p>
<p>I'm more of a protein powder kinda guy.</p>
<p>So I searched for cricket protein powder and found absolutely none.</p>
<p>Woah. What?</p>
<p>Why not? <b>It has astounding health benefits and is more eco-friendly compared to normal protein powders.</b> Why hasn't anyone created it before? I have no idea.</p>
<p>I have to create this.</p>
<p>The world needs this.</p>
<p>Everyone needs to try this.</p>
<p><b>I learned how to create protein powder from scratch, </b>from sourcing manufacturers, creating crude formulas and finding cricket farms (I eventually found one)</p>
<p>After months and months of development, I finally came up with Crik Nutrition's very first product - <b>Vanilla Flavoured Cricket Protein Powder.</b></p>
<p>Insects are becoming big and in your generation, they'll be <b>part of everyone's diet.</b></p>
<p>I'm stoked for this to happen and I hope you guys are too. <b>You &amp; I are going to be the first creators of cricket protein powder,</b> which quite possibly could become the main type of protein powder in the future!</p>
<p>Even if crickets aren't your thing, you could give it a try just to show off to your friends <b>how badass you are and at the same time, give back to Earth.</b></p>
<p><b>Nobody can make this happen alone. </b></p>
<p>That's why Crik needs you guys! Together, we can prove that we can make delicious, nourishing protein powder without harming Earth.</p>
<p><b>If you don't have the means to back us, no worries! </b>Just support us and let others know. A little goes a long way.</p>

I wanted to give crickets a go, but unfortunately, I don't really eat protein bars.

So I searched for cricket protein powder and found absolutely none.
Woah. What?
Why not? It has astounding health benefits and is more eco-friendly compared to normal protein powders. Why hasn't anyone created it before? I have no idea.
I have to create this.
The world needs this.
Everyone needs to try this.
I learned how to create protein powder from scratch, from sourcing manufacturers, creating crude formulas and finding cricket farms (I eventually found one)
After months and months of development, I finally came up with Crik Nutrition's very first product - Vanilla Flavoured Cricket Protein Powder.

</p><p></p><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>FreeSpeechMe is a Free Software plug-in for Firefox that allows you to effortlessly view Dot-Bit websites. Dot-Bit is a new type of website that, unlike Dot-Com or Dot-Net (etc), is NOT controlled by any government or corporation.<br/><br/>We already have working beta versions of the FreeSpeechMe Free Software plug-in for Windows and GNU/Linux. You can start using them <i>today</i>. We have them ready to install on our website at:  <a href=""http://www.freespeechme.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.freespeechme.org</a> </p><p>
</p>
<p></p><p></p><center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.freespeechme.org/no_censorship.png"" src="""" style=""""/></center><br/>Dot-Bit is also resistant to DNS or HTTPS hijacking, which is common and easy with normal top-level domains. DNS or HTTPS hijacking is when someone redirects your traffic to an impostor website, which allows them to steal passwords or install malware.  DNS and HTTPS hijacking are not theoretical threats.  In July 2011, DigiNotar, a major corporation in charge of preventing hijacking, was compromised. Over 300,000 users fell victim to fraudulent websites which appeared to be HTTPS-secured. The attackers were able to impersonate the CIA, MI6, Facebook, Microsoft, Skype, Twitter, WordPress, Mozilla, and hundreds of other targets. DigiNotar didn't notice for over a month.  Dot-Bit would have eliminated this attack vector.<br/><br/>Dot-Bit domains propagate worldwide within minutes, so new Dot-Bit websites show up promptly for everyone, rather than in 24-72 hours like with other domains. Dot-Bit is secured using the same peer-to-peer technology which protects Bitcoin. <br/><p>FreeSpeechMe rises above previous Dot-Bit software packages in that <i>it does not need to trust any third parties, </i>AND it's<i> </i>easy to install.<br/></p><center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.freespeechme.org/BTC-NMC.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></center>You can register a Dot-Bit domain today using the inexpensive digital currency, Namecoin (a spin-off of Bitcoin which provides the infrastructure for Dot-Bit). Dot-Bit domains currently cost just a few pennies to register, and you don't have to go through anyone else to do it. We've written easy to follow guides on doing all of this. <br/><br/><p>FreeSpeechMe also supports a new feature of Dot-Bit domains:
the ability to point to anonymously hosted websites using <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tor</a> or <a href=""http://geti2p.net/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">I2P</a>.
Tor and I2P are networks that allow users to host websites without revealing
their identities or locations.</p>
<p>Tor and I2P are a necessity for human rights activists and
whistleblowers working in repressive countries, and both networks were critical
in keeping citizens safe during the Arab Spring. FreeSpeechMe solves a major
issue that has plagued Tor and I2P: giving them domain names that both are
human-memorable (Tor normally has domains like duskgytldkxiuqc6.onion) and can
only point to the correct website (I2P domains can normally point to different
websites for different users). Note that Dot-Bit only keeps the location and IP
address of the domain owner private (assuming the domain is registered using
Tor); the identity of the domain owner may be linkable with that person's other
usage of Namecoin (e.g. usernames at exchanges).</p>

</p><p></p>We love all donations, but we <i>especially</i> love donations in 
Namecoin. Namecoin is the concrete used to build the roads of this new 
Internet superhighway system. 

<br/><br/>This isn't just ""a plug-in."" FreeSpeechMe, Dot-Bit and Namecoin are a complete new Internet ecosystem. We are building the roads to a secure and censor-resistant Web 4.0. <br/><br/><p><b>TO-DO LIST FOR CODING
AND BOUNTIES</b><br/></p><p>As a Namecoin-based project, FreeSpeechMe is part of a
significant ecosystem of software which can benefit from improvements. 
Since FreeSpeechMe directly uses much of this software, and we like to give
back, we plan to use some of the funds we raise to improve the underlying
Namecoin software, in addition to the FreeSpeechMe code itself.  Because
<b>what's good for Namecoin is good for FreeSpeechMe, and what's good for
FreeSpeechMe is good for Namecoin.</b>
</p><p>We'll favor hiring people who actually already did some of
the work on Namecoin and Namecoin-related software. First because they know the
code better than anyone, but also because they deserve to be first in line for
paid bounties on Namecoin-related systems. </p>
<p>Below are some examples of the improvements to both
FreeSpeechMe and other Namecoin-universe software that we want to have a hand
in implementing.  Some of these could be put into operation directly by
us, others we would like to fund via posting bounties.  Note that
Namecoin-related improvements are typically discussed in the development
community to ensure high-quality design, so it is possible that some of the
improvements listed below will change based on community feedback.</p>
<p>Just getting to our current FreeSpeechMe beta has been an
immense undertaking. But we'd like to go much further, to do the ""work
under the hood"" that the average user never sees, but that results in a
system that could solve many of the problems currently experienced in the
entire Internet. We need to do a lot of heavy lifting to not just build an
impermeable shell around this new system, but to harden the system itself into
that worldwide walled fortress for freedom. </p>
<p>But we also take this down to complex frame-level surgical
engineering that will make FreeSpeechMe effortless to use and incredibly
valuable to everyone worldwide who uses the Internet.</p>
<p>Think about what a massively complex system Google is. Now
think about what the average user sees: just a simple search box on a mostly
blank page. We're not postulating that FreeSpeechMe will grow to be as complex
as Google, but the analogy is apt. </p>
<p>Below is our ambitious list. We can implement many of these
if we reach our funding goal. If we don't reach our goal, we'll get as much
done as possible. </p><p>
</p><center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.freespeechme.org/smalYinYangCropped.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></center><p>
</p><p><b>FreeSpeechMe-SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS WE PLAN TO DO:</b></p>
<p><b>Hide nmcontrol/namecoind windows on Windows</b></p>GNU/Linux users don't see the terminal
windows for backend software; Windows users shouldn't be bothered by them
either.<br/><br/><p><b>Don't try to visit .bit websites when blockchain isn't
downloaded</b></p>
<p>  Right now, visiting a .bit website with
an incomplete blockchain will use an older version of that name's data. 
Usually this results in a failure to load the page with no good explanation of
what's wrong, but in certain rare cases it could also hypothetically result in
security issues such as hijacking.  A better version of FreeSpeechMe
should refuse to use incomplete blockchains.</p>
<p><b>Facilitate non-Firefox usage</b></p>
<p>  FreeSpeechMe uses a networking method,
HTTP, which is specific to website traffic.  Replacing it with a different
method, SOCKS, would make it much more flexible, so you could use Dot-Bit for
non-website Internet applications such as SSH.  It should also be possible
to route other web browsers such as Chromium through FreeSpeechMe. 
FreeSpeechMe should support being installed as a standalone application for
users who don't use Firefox (although obviously Firefox will remain the main
method of installation).</p>
<p><b>Improvements for anonymous browsing</b></p>
<p>  Right now FreeSpeechMe supports routing
its traffic through anonymization proxies such as Tor and I2P (if they are
installed), but it is not compatible with TorBrowser, so while attackers
generally can't see your location or IP address, they can deduce that different
activities you do online may have come from the same person. FreeSpeechMe
should be improved to function in TorBrowser, which would prevent linkage of
different online activities.</p>
<p><b>Improvements for anonymous hosting</b></p>
<p>  FreeSpeechMe supports Tor and I2P hidden
services (if the user has Tor or I2P installed), but does not support Freenet,
OnionCat, GarliCat, or other anonymous hosting networks.  This should be
improved.</p>
<p><b>Support for next-gen TLS specification</b></p>
<p>  FreeSpeechMe is using a method of
specifying certificates to prevent hijacking which is deprecated in the Dot-Bit
specification. While this method remains very secure, the newer specification
has more features, and FreeSpeechMe should implement it.</p>
<p><b>HTTPS enforcement</b></p>
<p>  Websites which claim to support HTTPS in
their domain record should automatically be loaded in HTTPS, even if the user
accidentally forgets the ""s"", to prevent hijacking in such cases.
(Note for geeks: this is like the HSTS specification, but works even for sites
you haven't visited before.)</p>
<p><b>Intelligent Redirecting</b></p>
<p>  Websites that want to support Dot-Bit
should be able to do so without changing their server configuration, and
instead have FreeSpeechMe make the server think the preexisting domain is being
requested.  The user would still see the
Dot-Bit URL in Firefox, and unlike iframe-based methods, the URL displayed in
Firefox would change accordingly as the user clicks links..</p>
<p><b>Fix HTTP protocol bugs</b></p>
<p>  Unencrypted HTTP Dot-Bit websites
occasionally have odd behavior in FreeSpeechMe (sometimes manifesting as links
not working properly); this is most frequently seen in WordPress
websites.  While we strongly encourage the use of HTTPS (which isn't
subject to these bugs), we still want to fix the bugs with HTTP websites.</p>
<p><b>Round-Robin Load Balancing</b></p>
<p>  Some large websites use multiple server
IP addresses for a single domain.  FreeSpeechMe should be able to randomly
choose one.</p>
<p><b>OTHER NAMECOIN SOFTWARE IMPROVEMENTS </b></p>
<p><span>  </span>Some
of this is possibly out of the scope of this one Indiegogo campaign, depending
on funds raised. But these are things we're very interested in helping
implement:</p>
<p><b>Rebase on the latest Bitcoin code</b></p>
<p>  Namecoin is based on an outdated version
of Bitcoin (0.3.x).  We should rebase on a current release.  We
inquired with a well-qualified and well-respected contractor (who developed
Namecoin-Qt) about how much this rebase would cost; the estimate was around
$17,000-$35,000 US.  Spending that much on one project would be out of the
realm of this first campaign.  However, it
may be possible to reduce this cost significantly by rebasing on a codebase
other than Bitcoin, such as libcoin.</p>
<p><b>Improve scalability</b></p>
<p>  Namecoin currently requires having the
entire blockchain for good security.  While the 1.6GB blockchain isn't a
large concern right now, future scalability requires that clients be able to
securely resolve names without possessing the blockchain.  There is a
proposal for this called SPV+UTXO.</p>
<p><b>Automatic renewal of names</b></p>
<p>  Losing your names because you forgot to
renew them is a problem.  </p>
<p>Names should be able to be renewed automatically. Preferably
without decrypting the wallet each time the name is renewed, and maybe without
even needing your client to be open when it renews.  Any solution must be
trust-free.</p>
<p><b>Cold storage of Namecoin name keys</b></p>
<p>  To update a Namecoin name, the keys must
be decrypted on a computer with Internet access; this could be a security risk
if malware is installed on that computer.  To fix this, cold storage
should be used, as is possible with Bitcoin.  </p>
<p><span>  </span>This
is in two parts: (1) port the <a href=""https://bitcoinarmory.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Armory</a>
client to Namecoin (this allows transactions to be signed offline), and (2)
allow a cold-storage name to be used as a revocation key for a hot-wallet name
(this is called the ""import"" field).</p>
<p><b>Optimize Speed</b></p>
<p>  Dot-Bit is already much faster than other
top-level domains for both name lookup and name propagation.  However, it
can be made even faster.  </p>
<p>We estimate that pre-cached name lookup time can be decreased
by 2- to 5-fold in some cases, uncached name lookup time can be decreased
significantly, name update propagation can be reduced from 40 minutes to under
1 minute, and blockchain sync time can be reduced significantly.</p>
<p><b>Android support</b></p>
<p>  Namecoin software currently does not
support Android; this situation should be improved.</p>
<p><b>Better blockchain anonymity</b></p>
<p>  Like Bitcoin, Namecoin can keep the
location and IP address of name owners anonymous (if used with Tor), but the
various activities of name owners can be linked by an attacker.  This
should be improved, e.g. by implementing Zerocoin.</p>
<p><b>Better blockchain privacy</b></p>
<p>  Some name owners may wish their records
to not be publicly accessible; encryption would improve this situation.</p>
<p><b>Decentralized website single sign-on</b></p>
<p>  Namecoin can be used to log into websites
in a secure way without needing a password (protecting people from database
leaks or cracked passwords without trusting a third party such as ""all
your data are belong to us"" systems like Facebook); this is implemented as
the <a href=""https://nameid.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NameID</a> library by domob. 
Unfortunately, this library is not easy for non-programmers to integrate with
existing websites. Plugins should be created for major website backends such as
Drupal, phpBB, WordPress, and SMF, to allow trust-free NameID sign-on to be as
easy as checking a box.</p>
<p><b>Automated builds</b></p>
<p>  Namecoin software should support
automated builds and testing so that our developers and testers can work more
efficiently.  The builds should also be deterministic (as Bitcoin and Tor
are doing) to improve security.</p>
<p><b>Offline signing of static websites</b></p>
<p>  Verifying signatures of static websites
against the blockchain would prevent hijacking even if a web server is
completely compromised.</p>
<p><b>SSH client integration</b></p>
<p>  Log into your servers remotely without
trusting your network or manually verifying fingerprints, using the same
anti-hijacking features that FreeSpeechMe first implemented.</p>
<h3>PERKS</h3><p>They are all pretty nifty and fun. But we've chosen each perk carefully; they all promote the FreeSpeechMe plug-in. Because the primary goals of this campaign are: <br/></p><ul>
<li>Promoting FreeSpeechMe</li>
<li> Improving the software and the methodologies for adopting and utilizing it<br/>
</li>
<li>Spreading adoption Dot-Bit<br/>
</li>
</ul><h3>Closing Arguments<br/>
</h3><p>It's often remarked that the Internet runs the world.  But if governments, corporations, and criminals can censor and hijack websites at will, the end result won't be good for the Internet, or the world.  We have a solid track record working with the technologies behind Dot-Bit.  We created the first ever implementation of the Dot-Bit feature which prevents HTTPS hijacking, as well as the first ever trust-free Dot-Bit Firefox plug-in.  We are an active participant in the Dot-Bit and Namecoin development process.</p><p>FreeSpeechMe is a
game-changing world-advancing leap for freedom. Please help us raise
50,000 dollars to further perfect the FreeSpeechMe Free Software
plug-in, spread its adoption and adoption of Dot-Bit, and help save the Internet from the website censors and hijackers of the world<b>.</b><br/></p><p></p><p></p></div>","Short SummaryFreeSpeechMe is a Free Software plug-in for Firefox that allows you to effortlessly view Dot-Bit websites.

HTTP, which is specific to website traffic.  Replacing it with a different
method, SOCKS, would make it much more flexible, so you could use Dot-Bit for
non-website Internet applications such as SSH.  It should also be possible
to route other web browsers such as Chromium through FreeSpeechMe. 
FreeSpeechMe should support being installed as a standalone application for
users who don't use Firefox (although obviously Firefox will remain the main
method of installation).
Improvements for anonymous browsing
  Right now FreeSpeechMe supports routing
its traffic through anonymization proxies such as Tor and I2P (if they are
installed), but it is not compatible with TorBrowser, so while attackers
generally can't see your location or IP address, they can deduce that different
activities you do online may have come from the same person. FreeSpeechMe
should be improved to function in TorBrowser, which would prevent linkage of
different online activities.
Improvements for anonymous hosting
  FreeSpeechMe supports Tor and I2P hidden
services (if the user has Tor or I2P installed), but does not support Freenet,
OnionCat, GarliCat, or other anonymous hosting networks.  This should be
improved.
Support for next-gen TLS specification
  FreeSpeechMe is using a method of
specifying certificates to prevent hijacking which is deprecated in the Dot-Bit
specification. While this method remains very secure, the newer specification
has more features, and FreeSpeechMe should implement it.
HTTPS enforcement
  Websites which claim to support HTTPS in
their domain record should automatically be loaded in HTTPS, even if the user
accidentally forgets the ""s"", to prevent hijacking in such cases.
(Note for geeks: this is like the HSTS specification, but works even for sites
you haven't visited before.)
Intelligent Redirecting
  Websites that want to support Dot-Bit
should be able to do so without changing their server configuration, and
instead have FreeSpeechMe make the server think the preexisting domain is being
requested.  The user would still see the
Dot-Bit URL in Firefox, and unlike iframe-based methods, the URL displayed in
Firefox would change accordingly as the user clicks links..
Fix HTTP protocol bugs
  Unencrypted HTTP Dot-Bit websites
occasionally have odd behavior in FreeSpeechMe (sometimes manifesting as links
not working properly); this is most frequently seen in WordPress
websites.  While we strongly encourage the use of HTTPS (which isn't
subject to these bugs), we still want to fix the bugs with HTTP websites.
Round-Robin Load Balancing
  Some large websites use multiple server
IP addresses for a single domain.  FreeSpeechMe should be able to randomly
choose one.
OTHER NAMECOIN SOFTWARE IMPROVEMENTS 
  Some
of this is possibly out of the scope of this one Indiegogo campaign, depending
on funds raised. But these are things we're very interested in helping
implement:
Rebase on the latest Bitcoin code
  Namecoin is based on an outdated version
of Bitcoin (0.3.x).  We should rebase on a current release.  We
inquired with a well-qualified and well-respected contractor (who developed
Namecoin-Qt) about how much this rebase would cost; the estimate was around
$17,000-$35,000 US.  Spending that much on one project would be out of the
realm of this first campaign.  However, it
may be possible to reduce this cost significantly by rebasing on a codebase
other than Bitcoin, such as libcoin.
Improve scalability
  Namecoin currently requires having the
entire blockchain for good security.  While the 1.6GB blockchain isn't a
large concern right now, future scalability requires that clients be able to
securely resolve names without possessing the blockchain.  There is a
proposal for this called SPV+UTXO.
Automatic renewal of names
  Losing your names because you forgot to
renew them is a problem.  
Names should be able to be renewed automatically. Preferably
without decrypting the wallet each time the name is renewed, and maybe without
even needing your client to be open when it renews.  Any solution must be
trust-free.
Cold storage of Namecoin name keys
  To update a Namecoin name, the keys must
be decrypted on a computer with Internet access; this could be a security risk
if malware is installed on that computer.  To fix this, cold storage
should be used, as is possible with Bitcoin.  
  This
is in two parts: (1) port the Armory
client to Namecoin (this allows transactions to be signed offline), and (2)
allow a cold-storage name to be used as a revocation key for a hot-wallet name
(this is called the ""import"" field).
Optimize Speed
  Dot-Bit is already much faster than other
top-level domains for both name lookup and name propagation.  However, it
can be made even faster.  
We estimate that pre-cached name lookup time can be decreased
by 2- to 5-fold in some cases, uncached name lookup time can be decreased
significantly, name update propagation can be reduced from 40 minutes to under
1 minute, and blockchain sync time can be reduced significantly.
Android support
  Namecoin software currently does not
support Android; this situation should be improved.
Better blockchain anonymity
  Like Bitcoin, Namecoin can keep the
location and IP address of name owners anonymous (if used with Tor), but the
various activities of name owners can be linked by an attacker.  This
should be improved, e.g. by implementing Zerocoin.
Better blockchain privacy
  Some name owners may wish their records
to not be publicly accessible; encryption would improve this situation.
Decentralized website single sign-on
  Namecoin can be used to log into websites
in a secure way without needing a password (protecting people from database
leaks or cracked passwords without trusting a third party such as ""all
your data are belong to us"" systems like Facebook); this is implemented as
the NameID library by domob. 
Unfortunately, this library is not easy for non-programmers to integrate with
existing websites. Plugins should be created for major website backends such as
Drupal, phpBB, WordPress, and SMF, to allow trust-free NameID sign-on to be as
easy as checking a box.
Automated builds
  Namecoin software should support
automated builds and testing so that our developers and testers can work more
efficiently.  The builds should also be deterministic (as Bitcoin and Tor
are doing) to improve security.
Offline signing of static websites
  Verifying signatures of static websites
against the blockchain would prevent hijacking even if a web server is
completely compromised.
SSH client integration
  Log into your servers remotely without
trusting your network or manually verifying fingerprints, using the same
anti-hijacking features that FreeSpeechMe first implemented.
PERKSThey are all pretty nifty and fun. But we've chosen each perk carefully; they all promote the FreeSpeechMe plug-in. Because the primary goals of this campaign are: 
Promoting FreeSpeechMe
 Improving the software and the methodologies for adopting and utilizing it

Spreading adoption Dot-Bit

Closing Arguments
It's often remarked that the Internet runs the world.  But if governments, corporations, and criminals can censor and hijack websites at will, the end result won't be good for the Internet, or the world.  We have a solid track record working with the technologies behind Dot-Bit.  We created the first ever implementation of the Dot-Bit feature which prevents HTTPS hijacking, as well as the first ever trust-free Dot-Bit Firefox plug-in.  We are an active participant in the Dot-Bit and Namecoin development process.FreeSpeechMe is a
game-changing world-advancing leap for freedom. Please help us raise
50,000 dollars to further perfect the FreeSpeechMe Free Software
plug-in, spread its adoption and adoption of Dot-Bit, and help save the Internet from the website censors and hijackers of the world.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

I am the development coordinator for The Snyder Center for Aphasia Life
Enhancement (SCALE)- a community treatment center for people with aphasia and
their families.  <b>Imagine losing your ability to speak, read, write, or understand</b> –
while at the same time, your intellectual capacities and memory remain intact. This
debilitating and frustrating condition is called “aphasia,” from the Greek word
for “speechlessness.” Commonly caused by a stroke, brain tumor, head injury, or
neurological disorder, aphasia is the result of damage to the language center
of the brain. Aphasia is often mistaken for deafness, psychiatric illness,
alcoholism, or developmental disability. Aphasia does not discriminate – it can
happen to anyone, at any age, at any time.  In fact, almost 2 million Americans suffer
from aphasia. </p>
<p>My brother-in-law, Keith had a stroke at the age of 40.  It was massive.  He was unable to speak or write and, like
many stroke survivors, was paralyzed on his right side.  Keith spent the first two months in the hospital
doing intensive speech, occupational, and physical therapy.  My sister, Jane, networked extensively to
find the best therapy available, battle with insurance companies, and do
whatever necessary to ensure Keith would have the best recovery possible.  SCALE has been a godsend, but insurance didn’t
cover the cost of the program.   </p>
<p>  SCALE is a unique facility, specifically
designed to improve not only speech and communication, but also the quality of life
for those who struggle with aphasia. Aphasia is an <b>extremely isolating</b> condition that can lead to severe depression.
It not only steals one’s ability to speak and read, it also severs one’s
ability to connect with family, friends improve, and everyday life. That is why
SCALE puts “community” at the heart of all its programs and services. SCALE provides a community of
peers as well as many opportunities to work with trained professionals who
support and guide individuals with aphasia as they reengage in life. </p>
<p>Keith has worked incredibly hard since his stroke. He spends
close to thirty hours every week in speech therapy, the majority of which is
done at SCALE. With this therapy, Keith has been able to reclaim a significant
portion of his life, including, most importantly, his ability to communicate
with his family and friends. He has learned new skills to support his
communication and uses an array of technology to engage with his peers and
family.  Many SCALE members have also
made <b>life-changing progress </b>while at SCALE.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, people with aphasia need a lifetime of
therapy and medical insurance does not cover the services provided at SCALE. Further,
individuals with aphasia and paralysis are usually unable to return to work.
Therefore, there are many people with aphasia who don’t have resources to pay
for ongoing treatment or the support of family to advocate on their behalf.  This is why I felt the need to post this
request.  Everyone should be able to
receive the needed long-term therapy, money should not be a factor.</p>
<p> It is our mission to be
their voice. SCALE is in desperate need of funds for scholarships.  SCALE members are asked to pay a tuition fee
based on their individual financial situation and many applicants require
scholarship support. For every $25 that you contribute to SCALE, you will sponsor

</div></div>","Emmunify
uses communications technology to help vaccinate more infants so they can live
longer, do better in school, have higher cognitive abilities, less
malnutrition, earn more as adults, and get out of poverty.

Emmunify
Two
years ago we started Emmunify to use technology to increase vaccination by connecting
those who need vaccinations with those who provide vaccinations and those who
plan and supply vaccinations.  And to do
it cheaply! Through hard work we won some awards for the idea at UC Berkeley
Hacking  Health  and BigIdeas@Berkeley.  We used the prize money to test a prototype in the New Delhi slums where less than 50% of children are fully
immunized.
 








We received enthusiastic responses from families and health workers and  great interest in using the Emmunify platform as soon as possible.  Now we are asking you to support us to write the software code, purchase the hardware, and test
it among a larger group of families.





What We Need & What You Get The
$25,000 initial goal will support:
Software Development, including:

The
application for use on the tablet that the health workers use to
read and update the vaccine record on the chip
The
interface between the tablet and the cloud
Cloud
analytics and dashboard
Reminder
messages for families in local language via voice mail and SMS


Implementation
of the system with Aarushi Charitable Trust(ACT), a not for profit which
provides girls’ education and family health services in the New Delhi slums:


Train health workers and supervisors who will use the Emmunify tablets
Purchase tablets for health workers and chips for each child
Payment of supervisors
Track vaccinations for 9  months among 50 infants 
We
gratefully acknowledge all your donations and look forward to sending you one
or more our perks listed here on the campaign page.

The Impact

Why are Vaccines important?  Vaccines stop preventable diseases and in turn, save lives, prevent disability and illness, and reduce health care expenses and help break the cycle of poverty.  Among the poorest, vaccinating just an additional 100 children can save two lives!




Why
aren’t children vaccinated?  Many
obstacles prevent infants from receiving even the most basic vaccines, and the
Emmunify platform helps solve these.






How Emmunify Works
To improve
delivery of immunizations, we set ourselves a few goals:


Can we make an
immunization medical record that is easy to carry, easy to use and easy for
patients to move between care providers?
Can we make it usable
without wifi, phone service, or electricity?
Can we make it
resilient to heat, humidity, and rain?
And can we keep costs
to a minimum?
Each child has a small chip with its current vaccination information that is stuck
on the family mobile phone.

The Solution:


At a
vaccination site, the health worker uses a tablet to read the chip by Near
Field Communication. She provides the
needed vaccine and immediately rewrites and updates the chip and no WiFi, Phone
service, or electricity is needed.


When
the health worker later has access to WiFi or phone, this information is transmitted to the cloud. The cloud analytics are used to organize vaccine distribution, supplies and
purchases.


Emmunify then sends automated
voice mail and SMS messages to families to tell them when vaccines are needed,
and where to get them. When the family comes for vaccination, supplies are
ready to go. The health workers rapidly determine which vaccines are needed,
and waiting times are much shorter.






Many families have a hard time keeping track
of their children’s vaccination records. Emmunify digitizes these records and
keeps them in a chip stuck to the family’s mobile phone, so they are easy to
locate and update.






 Essentially all families have cell phones in India.  Mobile adoption is projected at 72% by 2016.
[1] For families in the slums, phones are a valuable possession and are securely
carried. Even with high mobile adoption, slums and outlying areas still have
problems with consistent phone and data service connectivity.

<h3>THANK YOU so much to everyone who helped me reach my goal!! Even though I have reached the $1500 that I set for this particular fundraiser, any more contributions are still welcome and greatly appreciated! <br/><br/><br/>Short Summary</h3>
<p>If you know me, you know that I'm passionate about photography. I have decided to use this passion to to make a real difference in underprivileged communities and fragile ecosystems. There are many countries around the world that are in need, but my heart really goes out to Ghana. Most Ghanaians remain among the world's poorest people, earning an average of less than $4 per day, and a large percent of the population lacks in basic needs. Ghana's wildlife is threatened by poaching, human settlement, and habitat loss brought on by deforestation. Today, only around 33% of Ghana is still forested, and this number depletes by about 1.3% each year, which significantly affects the ecosystem. There are an unfortunate number of endangered species in Ghana, including the African elephant, the chimpanzee, and the Diana monkey. Other species including the lion, the pied bat, the red-fronted gazelle, the spotted-necked otter, and the white-toothed shrew are currently vulnerable to endangerment. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>I will be participating in a few volunteer projects in Ghana, including the following:</p>
<p>Orphanages - this project is in Koforidua, and focuses on working and caring for orphans, aged 1-23. </p>
<p>Teaching and phyical education: - this is a program to help young athletes in high schools by providing physical education classes and assistant coaches for school teams. </p>
<p>National Parks and Reserves - these parks have been established to protect animals and their natural habitats, not only for conservation, but for research and study as well. The goal of this project is to help educate tourists and local communities on the importance of wildlife and environmental conservation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will be using my skills as a photographer to help out with all of these projects in August 2012. I will be traveling between Koforidua and Mole National Park, as well as some smaller conservation sites. I will be documenting the daily lives of Ghanaians and volunteers and use these images to bring awareness to the issues in Ghana. In the national parks and reserves, I will be photographing wildlife for the use of education and images that the gift shops can use to help raise money for conservation and awareness. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why I need your help</h3>
<p>What I need funding for: </p>
<p>- Placement fee (which includes accomodation and 2 meals a day): $1200</p>
<p>- Flights: $3000</p>
<p>-Volunteer Work Visa: $200</p>
<p>-Vaccinations and Medication: $400</p>
<p>-All in-country transportation between cities and national parks</p>
<p>-Equipment (extra memory cards, batteries, portable hard drives etc.)</p>
<p>I am working very hard to raise as much of this money that I can myself. I have picked up a couple extra jobs, as well as moved into my friends living room for cheaper rent (Thanks, Ariel!) Above and beyond my stated budget, I will be saving my money for a laptop to process and edit my images. Even though I am doing everything I can to get myself to Ghana, I can't make that much money in just a few months, so that is why I need your help!</p>

<p><br/><br/><strong>Our Team</strong></p>
<p>Zekira is being built by five longtime Silicon Valley veterans who are passionate about solving this problem.  It's a labor of love for us, not just another project.  You can find more information about us below, and you can meet us in the video.</p>
<p><br/><br/><strong>We Need Your Help</strong></p>
<p>Zekira is a big project.  We've been working it for more than a year, working nights and weekends and paying the bills out of our own pockets.   We'll ship the first version of Zekira this summer (and we will ship it, no matter what happens with our campaign here).  But we have ambitious plans for the future of the product, including taking it mobile.  We could move a lot faster with a bit of financial support.</p>
<p><br/>Zekira is a very unusual product in Silicon Valley startup terms.  We're creating a very large and sophisticated software program, while most startups make little utility apps.  And we're deploying first on the Mac and PC (because that's where most people have stored most of their data), while the typical startup deploys first on iPhone or the web.</p>
<p><br/>Our differences are scary to venture capitalists and angel investors.  We've shown Zekira to a lot of them.  They almost all love the product (most of them ask to be beta testers), but they tell us they're not comfortable funding us until we prove that people want the product.</p>
<p><br/>That's where you come in.  Your donation will solve two problems -- you'll help support the development of Zekira, and you'll prove that people want a solution to information overload.  That will give us the support we need to jump-start the product.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/><strong>What You Get for Your Donation</strong></p>
<p><br/>A small donation buys you a free copy of Zekira 1.0 when it ships this summer (you're pre-buying the product at a huge discount).  A slightly larger donation admits you to the Zekira Early Experience beta program, so you can start working with it now, and your feedback can help shape the product.  Other options give you recognition online and your name in the product.  We've also created several consulting and advertising offers for companies that want to help.</p>
<p><br/><br/><strong>How We'll Use Your Contribution</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution will directly support the development of Zekira.  We'll compensate some of our team members to work additional hours.  We'll also pay the license fees for some third-party software modules included in Zekira.  </p>
<p><br/>We've set a goal of $5,000, because that's enough to get version 1 of Zekira out the door sooner.  But any support you can give us will help, and the more support we get, the more features we can add to version 1.</p>
<p><br/>And who knows, if the fundraising here goes well enough, maybe we can skip the investors and work only for you.  We'd be just fine with that.</p>
<p><br/><br/><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p><br/>If you can't afford to make a donation, you can support Zekira by spreading the word:</p>

We Need Your Help
Zekira is a big project.  We've been working it for more than a year, working nights and weekends and paying the bills out of our own pockets.   We'll ship the first version of Zekira this summer (and we will ship it, no matter what happens with our campaign here).  But we have ambitious plans for the future of the product, including taking it mobile.  We could move a lot faster with a bit of financial support.
Zekira is a very unusual product in Silicon Valley startup terms.  We're creating a very large and sophisticated software program, while most startups make little utility apps.  And we're deploying first on the Mac and PC (because that's where most people have stored most of their data), while the typical startup deploys first on iPhone or the web.
Our differences are scary to venture capitalists and angel investors.  We've shown Zekira to a lot of them.  They almost all love the product (most of them ask to be beta testers), but they tell us they're not comfortable funding us until we prove that people want the product.
That's where you come in.  Your donation will solve two problems -- you'll help support the development of Zekira, and you'll prove that people want a solution to information overload.  That will give us the support we need to jump-start the product.
 
What You Get for Your Donation
A small donation buys you a free copy of Zekira 1.0 when it ships this summer (you're pre-buying the product at a huge discount).  A slightly larger donation admits you to the Zekira Early Experience beta program, so you can start working with it now, and your feedback can help shape the product.  Other options give you recognition online and your name in the product.  We've also created several consulting and advertising offers for companies that want to help.
How We'll Use Your Contribution
Your contribution will directly support the development of Zekira.  We'll compensate some of our team members to work additional hours.  We'll also pay the license fees for some third-party software modules included in Zekira.  
We've set a goal of $5,000, because that's enough to get version 1 of Zekira out the door sooner.  But any support you can give us will help, and the more support we get, the more features we can add to version 1.
And who knows, if the fundraising here goes well enough, maybe we can skip the investors and work only for you.  We'd be just fine with that.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't afford to make a donation, you can support Zekira by spreading the word:

*Please note.  Although we are very confident that we'll be able to ship Zekira 1.0, it is not yet a finished product, so we can't guarantee how well it will work or exactly which features will be in it.  You should check our website for more details on compatibility, and in particular which file types we'll support.

<h3>  My name is Robert Kemble. I was living in Seattle in 2007 when my wife died of breast cancer. In the years to follow I happened to come across my old high school sweetheart Cindy Weyrauch on classmates.com  Cindy and I began to talk to each other by computer  not knowing if i would  want a relationship again because of her disability. We began to talk to each other everyday and eventually decided that we were going to be together and  that I would move to the east coast. In 2009 I moved to Pittsburgh PA and we were together starting the relationship that was sidelined so many years ago. At that time Cindys health was fair with no major problems, however now she is plagued with serious effect of diabetes. Over the past 2 years Cindy has been in and out of the hospital. She suffers from kldney  problems and recently has been found to have congestive heart failure. She is what they call a ""Brittle""diabetic. Diabetes makes her digestion poor and she will have from time to time bouts of vomiting.  She has had laser surgery on her eyes, and is on blood thinners for a clotting disorder.  A disfunctional, poor fitting prosthetic leg makes it difficult for her to get around.  The leg she is currently useing causes her hip pain and is difficult to get on. Showering for her is a very difficult chore. The Prosthetic leg she has ""at the very least ""needs many  improvements. Preferably we would like to get her a more up to date version much like amputees from war use. She has mounting Medical bills and Caregiving expenses  forceing her to absorb many out of pocket health costs. I have decided to stay with her and take care of her to help her with her daily needs as she is also a fall risk.  Funding we recieve will go directly towards the expenses I listed, the Medical and, Caregiver money needed to cover all her daily needs.  In addition a seperate account will be set up towards the goal of  replaceing her current prosthetic leg. Because her health is poor, I want her to be able to more easily enjoy the life she has left.  Thankyou Rob and Cindy. Her and I truly did come"" Full Circle  UPDATE: Cindy now has been determined to need ""quadruple by-pass"" surgery in addition to all the above mentioned, Please help as our need has now become Urgent. Thankyou!!!! Her tiny arterys make surgery complicated! Her Kidney function could also cause concern, because she experienced some renal failure a couple of hospital stays ago due to a misuse of dye in a cat-scan, a hospital error. Now as of August 19th Cindy is suffering from complications post surgery. Her incision is very pain full and must be checked for a clot and her leg is badly swollen. Everything is being done to prevent her from loseing her good leg, however we need funding to have a better chance of saveing it.   In summary Cindy is a type one diabetic leg amputee that just had quadruple bypass surgery and has staqge 3 kidney failure. Diabetes has left her with neropathy pain and gastro-paresis. Please donate to her fund. </h3>

<p>We set out to create a life changing, portable pain relief device that was totally different than a standard TENS unit.  After 25 years of research and development, PAT is finally here.  Our perception of pain and the process of healing are electrically driven functions of the body. We have created a microcurrent therapy device that mimics your body’s natural current to alleviate your pain. No more pills, no more searching for relief, no more gimmicks that don't work. With PAT, you can stop trying to just block the pain and start treating it at the source.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494640638/gkdhvxdu66nqycifoeiv.png"" src=""""/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494598307/niwlxn3ls3dfpcgnxieb.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>PAT has 8 settings for different body parts and will treat numerous disorders including:</p>
<p><strong>Neck</strong>: Arthritis, muscle strain, partial disc herniation, degenerative disc disease, ankylosing spondylitis</p>
<p><strong>Shoulder</strong>: Arthritis, tendinitis, bursitis, rotator cuff tear or sprain, muscle strain</p>
<p><strong>Elbow</strong>: Tendinitis, arthritis, sprains and strains, bursitis, tennis elbow, golfer's elbow, ligament damage</p>
<p><strong>Wrist</strong>: Carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis, sprains and strains</p>
<p><strong>Hand</strong>: Arthritis, tendinitis, sprains, ligament damage</p>
<p><strong>Back</strong>: Sciatica, degenerative disc disease, arthritis, muscle strain, partial disc herniation</p>
<p><strong>Hip</strong>: Arthritis, bursitis, hip impingement, snapping hip syndrome, muscle strain</p>
<p><strong>Knee</strong>: Arthritis, bursitis, tendinitis, Osgood-Schlatter disorder, ligament damage</p>
<p><strong>Foot</strong>: Tendinitis, arthritis, Achilles tendon sprain or partial tear, ankle sprain, tarsal tunnel syndrome, plantar fasciitis</p>
<p>These are just a few of the conditions PAT will treat. Anything that has caused inflammation in any part of the body is a great candidate for PAT.</p>

<p><strong><i>During our testing and usability studies, many people successfully treated their pain. We found that PAT actually relieves pain a lot better than we ever dreamed. Here are a few of their comments:</i></strong></p>
<p>“I have had three neck fusion surgeries and for many years have had continued severe neck pain and great difficulty sleeping. After using PAT  a few times, it not only has relieved much of my pain but allows me to sleep through the night !"" - Peggy, Virginia</p>
<p>“I  make jewelry and the tendonitis I had in my thumb made it very difficult and painful to do my work. PAT has eliminated the pain in my thumb and now I use it regularly for aches and pain throughout my body from fibromyalgia. I love it!” -Deb, South Carolina</p>
<p>“I was in the midst of a men's basketball league season and my worn out knees were getting worse every game.  As a former college soccer and basketball player, my knees have suffered a lot more abuse than the average Joe!   I began using the device and, within a few days, my knee felt better. I then began using it on both knees and was able to play relatively pain free the next few games.  My only regret is that I had to give it back as it was a test unit!  Once these are available, I will be at the front of the line!” - Bob, Michigan</p>
<p>""I am a triathlete and had intense knee pain. I couldn't run without pain for over a year. I treated my knee two times and the next morning was able to run without knee pain. It's magical! -Claire, Ohio</p>
<p>""I have suffered with carpal tunnel symptoms for years and was in severe pain at the end of each work day until I started using this device. After only a few uses... I felt relief. Now my wrist and arm are pain free."" - Pam, Tennessee</p>
<p>""I had wrist and shoulder pain for over 1 year that never seemed to heal. After just a few weeks my wrist pain was gone. A little while longer and my shoulder didn't hurt either. I was honestly wondering if I would be able to throw a baseball or football with my boys in a few years. No doubts now"" -Justin, Georgia</p>
<p>""This device is amazing! No more shots in my knee. The pain is completely alleviated. I also had pretty severe joint pain in my hand. It's completely gone. It's changed my life.""- Jamie, North Carolina</p>

<p><strong>What is the difference in PAT and a standard TENS unit?</strong></p>
<p>TENS units use as much as 1,000 times more current than PAT. They are designed to temporarily block pain. By using much lower currents, PAT mimics the body’s natural currents so that the tissues that are causing the pain begin to normalize and thus pain is reduced.</p>
<p><strong>How many treatments will it take me to get relief?</strong></p>
<p>There is no set number of treatments. A recent muscle strain may feel 50% better after one treatment and gone after three. However, chronic pain may take a 5 or more treatments to feel a difference. Why is this? The longer you have the pain, the longer it may take to get rid of it. However, the majority of people begin to feel some relief by the second treatment.</p>
<p><strong>How hard is PAT to use on myself?</strong></p>
<p>PAT is very easy to use. Since the treatments are automatic based on the body part treated, all you have to do is apply two electrodes, connect them to the PAT device, turn it on, and choose the part you are treating. After the treatment is over, PAT will turn itself off.  For more information, see the owner’s manual.</p>
<p><strong>Can I treat any painful area no matter what causes it?</strong></p>
<p>With the exception of treating over known cancer areas, on the head or the front or sides of the neck, you can treat any part of the body that is causing pain.</p>
<p><strong>Can more than one person use the same unit?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, as long as they use a different set of electrode pads. Many people treat their whole family with one unit by ordering a set of electrode pads for each member of the family.</p>
<p><strong>What do you mean by your One Year Money Back Guarantee?</strong></p>
<p>Up to one year after delivery, if after using PAT you are not getting pain relief, you can send it back to us for a refund.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to see my physician before I use it?</strong></p>
<p>There is no prescription required for PAT. However, if you don’t understand why you are having the pain, we encourage you to see your physician to properly diagnose it. For example, if you have any concern there may be a fracture, see your doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to worry about shocks?</strong></p>
<p>No, the current used is direct current operating at 40-250 millionths of an amp. We say, you will only be shocked at how great it works!</p>
<p><strong>Who should not use PAT?</strong></p>
<p>Do not use PAT if you have a cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, or other implanted metallic or electronic device.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use it if I am pregnant?</strong></p>
<p>No, the safety of PAT and all other TENS devices have not been evaluated to treat pregnant women.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use PAT anywhere?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, as long as PAT doesn’t get wet, you can treat anytime and anywhere. This can be while walking, riding, or even at work.</p>
<p><strong>What does PAT stimulation feel like?</strong></p>
<p>Most people do not feel anything at all but it is common for people with sensitive skin to feel some tingling during the first phase which is from 10-15 minutes. This does not affect the treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any side effects?</strong></p>
<p>No, the only thing you may experience is slight skin irritation under the electrode pads. Marchan Medical offers hypoallergenic pads if you need them.</p>
<p><strong>How many treatments can I get before I need to change electrode pads?</strong></p>
<p>This depends on the condition of your skin and many other factors. However, most people get at least 15 treatments from one set of electrode pads. You use the electrodes until they will no longer stick to your skin. We supply you with 4 sets of electrodes when you originally buy PAT. More can be ordered at marchanmedical.com.</p>

<p>As we've said, our only hurdle is our final FDA clearance. Our FDA consultant is ready to file the paperwork as soon as this campaign ends. We believe that we have done everything necessary to ensure quick FDA clearance.</p>
<p>That is our only risk. We have 950 PAT systems in stock ready to ship and we have completed all the clinical testing and usability studies. Our manufacturer is ready to gear up production for up to 50,000 units per month. Our electrode pad manufacturer in California can deliver as many pads as we need. In other words, we are ready to ship the day we get our FDA clearance.</p>
</div><h3> </h3></div>","We set out to create a life changing, portable pain relief device that was totally different than a standard TENS unit.  After 25 years of research and development, PAT is finally here.  Our perception of pain and the process of healing are electrically driven functions of the body. We have created a microcurrent therapy device that mimics your body’s natural current to alleviate your pain. No more pills, no more searching for relief, no more gimmicks that don't work. With PAT, you can stop trying to just block the pain and start treating it at the source.


PAT has 8 settings for different body parts and will treat numerous disorders including:
Neck: Arthritis, muscle strain, partial disc herniation, degenerative disc disease, ankylosing spondylitis
Shoulder: Arthritis, tendinitis, bursitis, rotator cuff tear or sprain, muscle strain
Elbow: Tendinitis, arthritis, sprains and strains, bursitis, tennis elbow, golfer's elbow, ligament damage
Wrist: Carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis, sprains and strains
Hand: Arthritis, tendinitis, sprains, ligament damage
Back: Sciatica, degenerative disc disease, arthritis, muscle strain, partial disc herniation
Hip: Arthritis, bursitis, hip impingement, snapping hip syndrome, muscle strain
Knee: Arthritis, bursitis, tendinitis, Osgood-Schlatter disorder, ligament damage
Foot: Tendinitis, arthritis, Achilles tendon sprain or partial tear, ankle sprain, tarsal tunnel syndrome, plantar fasciitis
These are just a few of the conditions PAT will treat. Anything that has caused inflammation in any part of the body is a great candidate for PAT.


100% drug free
Lightweight, slim design
Portable/Wearable
AutoPATic (optimized, pre-set therapy settings). Treatment turns itself off automatically
Can be set up to treat in less than 1 minute
Backed by 25 years of research
1 year satisfaction guarantee
Uses silver electrode pads that distribute the current evenly. Replacement pads are $8.95 for two sets including shipping, enough for an average of 30 treatments.


PAT is made by Marchan Medical and we need your help. We have them in stock but we need to obtain final FDA clearance to get them out to people who need pain relief. Backing this campaign will help us achieve that goal. Also, we need your help in our campaign to give as many PAT systems as possible to our heroes--military and first responders.

With each PAT system you will get the main unit, wire, batteries, manual, case, and 4 sets of electrodes (enough for an average of 60 treatments). You also get a one year satisfaction guarantee starting the day your PAT is delivered.

You will have the opportunity to be the first to own PAT and will get a 30-40% discount by supporting us. The earlier in the campaign you join, the more discount you get. Also, please see we have perks where you can support our efforts to give PAT to all of our heroes that have pain.
Heroes to us are first responders, active military, and veterans. They put their bodies at risk to protect us every day. Many of them develop chronic pain as a result. Please see the perks that enable you to contribute to this cause, whether it is donating PAT to a hero, outfitting a first responder station, or simply contributing whatever you can to support giving PAT to these heroes.

Pius's son has a severe peanut &amp; tree nut allergy that has landed his family in the ER numerous times over last six years. Although Pius's son is well aware of what to not eat, his family still carries an Epinephrine injector all the time. Meanwhile, Eric has experienced personal tragedies involving a young family member with asthma who had suddenly passed away from respiratory and cardiac distress while his parents were away from home. We've learned from such family sagas that such things can happen to anyone. Ensuring children’s health and safety has since become a passion that we knew we wanted to solve and prevent future family tragedies.</p><p>Three years ago, after yet another ER visit due to Pius’s son's peanut allergy, we started to wonder if there was some way for us to get notified as soon as he started displaying symptoms of an attack. After intense discussion with some medical professionals, and extensive research into existing biosensor technologies, we began to design and build a device to allow us to always be connected to our children at all times, even when we weren’t there physically.</p><p>Two years later, the first wearable prototype was completed. It had all the sensors to measure skin temperature, skin humidity, heartbeat, oxygen levels, and motion, but having parent alerts only within Bluetooth range seemed insufficient. Once teamed up with some talented wireless communication engineers later, and we were able to extend communication range with Bluetooth 4.2, and add GPS.  With the added Base Station, we were sending signals from over 300 ft. away!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490919576/y4fnjyuxv8r6zeonxjin.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490919688/rjjthfnfpj5wchs56ojn.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490825144/rv97xgyk8vz4n7w480tq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490825512/mgqv4ke0ydb0rbiv6lyb.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490928664/io2ihewkvmc4nmuqc77w.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHERE WE ARE IN DEVELOPMENT &amp;<br/>WHY CROWDFUNDING?</strong></h3><p> </p><p>After almost three years of research and development efforts, including several proof-of-concepts, prototypes, tweaks, and refinements, we were able to test its functionalities in our prototypes as close as envisioned finished products.  We already selected most accurate and reliable biometric sensors and communication components that allow our devices to perform.  </p><p>We chose to run our campaign on Indiegogo so that our backers could truly help form the future of Happy Gadget devices - we want your honest feedback and will take all of it into account for future versions and updates.

Delivered via Bluetooth and Beacon technology, sensors will alert you to unusual changes in: In addition, its GPS function allows for location tracking of a lost child within range of your smartphone or base station's 10x Bluetooth range.  EXAMPLES OF USE CASE SCENARIOSThere are many urgent situations that can arise wherein a child needs help. Some scenarios in which parents could benefit from Happy Gadget alerts are if they have:
Children with allergies

Children with asthma

Children who may be feverish, vomiting, or otherwise sick

Children who may swallow foreign objects or begin to choke

Children who may fall on a hard surface and unable to respond

Children who may wander out of sight in crowded places
Children who may be abused or neglected while supervised by a babysitter
Children who may accidentally fall into a swimming pool

Children who may want to send an S.O.S. to the parent in a dangerous situation
And so much more.  TECHNICAL DETAILS  Sensors/Components:

In fact, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that there are more than 16 million people in the United States living with cognitive impairment; a condition that is predominantly misunderstood. Despite the continued increase of this condition, the current market does not provide enough opportunity for consumers to supplement their mental health before the problems of cognitive decline occur.</p><p>Our goal at Mino Nutrition is to create innovative and high quality products that offer a solution to cognitive decline. These products, however, are not just for the age generations that are most affected by dementia, Alzheimer’s and cognitive impairment. Instead, the premium line of Mino Nutrition products augment the mental capabilities for anyone who wants to sharpen their neural aptitudes. Whether it be to improve work performance, achieve fitness goals or experience an overall competitive edge, Mino Nutrition can provide an extraordinary level of alertness, focus and perceptual clarity. Our products offer immediate results in addition to the long-term neuron strengthening abilities.</p><p>Mino Nutrition sets itself apart from other nootropic brands through the Company’s utmost consideration of safety and ethical corporate practices. The supplement industry is highly unregulated, which has led to an influx of companies that lack transparency, quality and proven-safe ingredients.

My team and I have created a wide range of products over the past year and a half that we believe will help solve the current concerns with cognitive decline that plague our friends and family members. Mino Nutrition is dedicated to creating safe methods that strengthen and improve cognitive health. We have tested our products in the current dietary supplement market and received positive customer feedback. We believe we are onto something great. With your help we can turn our small business into a national brand which will enable us to get our products into the hands of those in need. Cognitive decline is an affliction experienced by millions of people around the globe that can severely detriment a person’s quality of life. In fact, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that there are more than 16 million people in the United States living with cognitive impairment; a condition that is predominantly misunderstood. Despite the continued increase of this condition, the current market does not provide enough opportunity for consumers to supplement their mental health before the problems of cognitive decline occur.Our goal at Mino Nutrition is to create innovative and high quality products that offer a solution to cognitive decline. These products, however, are not just for the age generations that are most affected by dementia, Alzheimer’s and cognitive impairment. Instead, the premium line of Mino Nutrition products augment the mental capabilities for anyone who wants to sharpen their neural aptitudes. Whether it be to improve work performance, achieve fitness goals or experience an overall competitive edge, Mino Nutrition can provide an extraordinary level of alertness, focus and perceptual clarity. Our products offer immediate results in addition to the long-term neuron strengthening abilities.Mino Nutrition sets itself apart from other nootropic brands through the Company’s utmost consideration of safety and ethical corporate practices. The supplement industry is highly unregulated, which has led to an influx of companies that lack transparency, quality and proven-safe ingredients. Justin Young, CEO and founder of Mino Nutrition, built the Company for the sole purpose of being able to provide products with integrity and ethical business practices.

<strong>It's truly Reusable.</strong> We engineered it to last for <em>thousands</em> of uses. It made of a sturdy plastic that is dishwasher safe and kid-indestructible :)!</li>

<strong>It is Dentist Recommended. ""Your teeth will thank you!""</strong> By bypassing coffee and tea from hitting the front of your teeth, your teeth will stay whiter and healthier longer.</li>
<li>
<strong>Helps prevent spills. </strong>It fits perfect into the hole of most to-go coffee cup lids, so you can focus on your day and not on trying to not spill your coffee all over your car console or your shirt.

<strong>It's sustainable. </strong>To us, sustainable means a responsibly produced product that actually reduces the carbon foot print produced from manufacturing and disposing of thousands of disposable straws every single day.

<div>I am 2 yrs old and I was diagnosed with stage 4 Neuroblastoma Cancer on December 22, 2011.  A large mass was found on the right side of my skull, adrenal gland, sternum, and right hip as well as various locations in my bone marrow.  I began chemo therapy on Christmas Eve, December 24, 2011.  My treatment will consist of 6 cycles of chemo therapy, blood transfusions, a bone marrow transplant, surgery, radiation and immuno therapy.  I will be going through treatment until mid 2013.  Funding will help my family financially and also assist in childhood cancer awareness.  Through your support my parents can keep their business running, make our mortgage payment, car payment, cover travel expenses to and from the hospital (1 1/2 to 3 hours away from home) and pay for our essential needs. </div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise approximately $85,000.  There are a lot of expenses incurred during this journey.  Our home needs to be kept germ free and extra clean as I am immuno compromised due to chemo therapy, our carpet needs to be replaced to eliminate germs and bacteria, I am on a special diet so it can become costly to eat, we only have one reliable car for our family and it needs to be consistently maintained as we are constantly traveling across the state of Florida to hospitals for me to get treatment and gas is expensive, my parents are not able to really work as we spend most of our time in the hospital, this has  put us in debt.  We also have a mortgage, car insurance and phone bills we need to pay.  In addition, I have a 10 month old brother.  We have a lot of needs at this time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is important to my family that we get funding, because my parents are spending a lot of their time taking care of my needs and cannot be stressed about finances.  I need their help and support to beat cancer.  The impact your contribution will make could possibly aide in saving my life and holding my family together during this difficult time. </p>

I am 2 yrs old and I was diagnosed with stage 4 Neuroblastoma Cancer on December 22, 2011.  A large mass was found on the right side of my skull, adrenal gland, sternum, and right hip as well as various locations in my bone marrow.  I began chemo therapy on Christmas Eve, December 24, 2011.  My treatment will consist of 6 cycles of chemo therapy, blood transfusions, a bone marrow transplant, surgery, radiation and immuno therapy.  I will be going through treatment until mid 2013.  Funding will help my family financially and also assist in childhood cancer awareness.  Through your support my parents can keep their business running, make our mortgage payment, car payment, cover travel expenses to and from the hospital (1 1/2 to 3 hours away from home) and pay for our essential needs. 

What We Need & What You Get
We need to raise approximately $85,000.  There are a lot of expenses incurred during this journey.  Our home needs to be kept germ free and extra clean as I am immuno compromised due to chemo therapy, our carpet needs to be replaced to eliminate germs and bacteria, I am on a special diet so it can become costly to eat, we only have one reliable car for our family and it needs to be consistently maintained as we are constantly traveling across the state of Florida to hospitals for me to get treatment and gas is expensive, my parents are not able to really work as we spend most of our time in the hospital, this has  put us in debt.  We also have a mortgage, car insurance and phone bills we need to pay.  In addition, I have a 10 month old brother.  We have a lot of needs at this time.


The Impact
It is important to my family that we get funding, because my parents are spending a lot of their time taking care of my needs and cannot be stressed about finances.  I need their help and support to beat cancer.  The impact your contribution will make could possibly aide in saving my life and holding my family together during this difficult time.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>These four athletes (from Left to Right, Lucas-7, Jackson-10, Lane-17, Kamlen-9) have all qualified for Junior Olympics-Nationals in Chicago, Illinois.  All four athletes are members of Vancouver Taekwondo Academy and have been studying Taekwondo for at 4-10 years.  All athletes earned Gold medals in the Oregon State Qualifier.   They train hard giving up afternoons after school and weekends for practice and tournaments. </p>
<p>All of these boys dream of being National Champions.  They have the drive, talent, and desire to go to Chicago and give it their all to become National Champions.  The only thing they lack is funding.  Please help these athletes realize their dreams.  Taekwondo has given them confidence, community, and strength in body and mind.  Going to Nationals would mean the world to these boys and they so deserve to go. </p>
<h3><strong>Break Down:</strong></h3>
<p>We are shooting for $5000, although the actual cost of the trip will be much more for all 4 athletes and their coach.  We are trying to alleviate some of the cost.  Below are some of the estimated costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airfare: $660/roundtrip per athlete  </li>
<li>Hotel:  $500/ per athlete for one week</li>
<li>Tournament Fees: $100/ per athlete</li>
<li>Coaches Fees: $250/athlete</li>
<li>Food: $300/athlete</li>
</ul>
<p>These are approximate costs and are conservative.  We plan on participating in other fundraising ideas (carwashes, etc.) to make up as much of the costs as we can.  If we do not reach our goal, all funds will still go to athletes to help alleviate some of the costs and burdens for families so they can send their athletes to Chicago with more ease.</p>
<p>Athletes will send personal thank you letters to all donators regardless of amount donated.  Every dollar is greatly appreciated. </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>In a world where it is sometimes a struggle to find good, these kids all maintain exemplary grades, dedication to their sport, and allegiance to their community.  The impact of your donation will introduce or reinforce such things as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charity</li>
<li>Humanity</li>
<li>Perseverance</li>
<li>And much more</li>
</ul>

<p>Alice was a client of mine - I am a Licensed Marriage Family Therapist - that couldn't afford to continue counseling.

<p>We need working capital - pure and simple. I have personally born the expenses of the offices and overhead for over a year in order to make the center a reality.</p>

He was coming home around midnight, when his back tire gave out, exploding, causing him to lose control of the bike. Witnesses and the paramedics who responded say he was traveling over 80 m.p.h. when this happened, and both he and the bike were sent cartwheeling into a ditch on the side of the road. Those who first responded found he was unconscious, not breathing and without a pulse.<br/><br/>When I was woken up and told, I raced to the emergency room with the words ""motorcycle accident"" and ""critical condition"" replaying over and over again in my head. I was certain, with all I knew about bikes, after all I'd seen and heard, that I'd lost my little brother. I had no hope. He had no hope. Bewildered and angry, I parked my car anywhere I could, and sprinted the remaining distance to the hospital's emergency entrance. Once inside, I numbly navigated past receptions and security guards until I was in a waiting room. At last, a doctor sat down with me and explained my brother's condition.<br/><br/>He was in critical condition. He has a fractured right clavicle, a fractured 1st left rib, a fractured pelvis, a fractured right fibula, a collapsed lung, and a contusion of the same. Finally, his aorta had a pseudoaneurysm, a likely result of high-impact during the crash. He was on a ventilator to assist breathing and his chest was opened to allow the air building in his chest cavity to escape, but he still would need surgery immediately. If his aorta ruptured, his blood pressure would drop and he would go into shock and die.<br/><br/>I entered the room, and saw him unconscious, tossing and turning on the gurney, with his neck braced and cords and lines of all sorts connected. He seemed like he was just sleeping and having a nightmare. The nurse affirmed everything the doctor had said, just before preparing him to be moved to surgery.</p>
<p>The next 24 hours were the longest, most stressful hours I'd ever known. As his guardian at that point, I did everything I could, seeing anyone, speaking with anyone, arranging anything I could, that might improve his chances. All the while I managed a never-ending barrage of concerned friends and family members, trying to give the full, accurate picture to all who asked. This critical period lasted for a few days, that my job very understandingly allowed me off. After his surgery had gone successfully, and days passed without any turns for the worse, we steadily saw him improve. CT scans were clean. He wasn't developing any new symptoms. No latent concussions. Nothing. The surgery was a success, and all the other pieces were coming together.<br/><br/>It's been 10 days now, since the accident, and he was discharged this afternoon. I am still reeling at how incredible this has all been. Cameron has no permanent disabilities, no head/neck/spine injuries, and no brain damage. With the staggering odds that motorcycle accidents generate on a daily basis working against him that night, he made it through, with a couple of broken bones and some painful aching. He still has a road of physical therapy to travel, but he's alive. It's a full-blown, spare-no-expense miracle.<br/><br/>Finally comes the expense part. Our family is seeking assistance to make Cameron's second chance in life worth something more than debt. We have no yet received our hospital bill, and it's already becoming an enormous stressor. It is a dreaded thought to imagine that another attempt at life is curtailed with something as unforeseen and debilitating as healthcare costs. We ask for anything you are willing to spare, or just to keep us in your thoughts.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This campaign is about health, about kids, and about common sense. My name is Loretta, and I am a member of the Board of Directors for World's Children, an amazing organization that helps the most vulnerable children in India.</p>
<p>Each of the Board members are taking on a findraising task to raise funds to meet an outstanding need in our orphanages right now. I am raising $2500 to purchase mosquito nets for 160 children that are right now without them. </p>
<p>Why mosquito nets? Malaria is rampant in India, and the number one way to get infected is to be bitten by an infected mosquito. There are other diseases a child can get from mosquito bites as well. Also, sleeping without a net can turn an good nights rest into a restless and fitful night with as many as 100 mosquito bites by morning. Among other things, this causes the child to be uncomfortable and unable to pay attention to their studies while in school, or to be able to feel good enough to have fun and play with the other children. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>At about $15.62 per net, $32 will buy two nets, $78 will buy 5, $156 will buy 10, and $500 will purchase 32 mosquito nets and protect 32 children every night. We need every child to have a net covering their sleeping area. Right now I raising funds for 160 children. Won't you please help me to raise this money and protect our children from disease?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>World's Children impacts some of the world's most vulnerable children. These children are often abandoned at birth or sold into slavery due to the family's abject poverty, gender bias, or for lack of family to care for them. Most of our orphanages have many more girls than boys. Because of the culture, the dowry system, and status, girls are often seen as a hardship and are unwanted at birth.</p>
<p>With your help, we can provide shelter, care, education, cultural upbringing, and safety for these children. We address all quality of life issues for all the children that reach our 49 orphanges. We are continuously seeking new ways to make their lives better, and to enrich the lives of our donors through lifelong partnerships with the orphanages and the children. You get to experience the difference you make! It is quite satisfying!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot help financially right now, won't you please send this to someone who may be interested in helping right now? Also, please sign up on our website for our newsletters. You will find the information uplifting and heartfelt, and you can keep updated on all of our projects. </p>

<h3>Drink To Live</h3>
<p>Most people need to eat to live but, my mom is at the point of needing to juice.  She has a disease that she's fighting and has been for the past 10 years called ""Sarcoidosis"".  Sarcoidosis  is a disease in which abnormal collections of chronic inflammatory cells (granulomas) form as nodules in multiple organs. The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown.  She's ONLY 48 years old, on oxygen, can't walk long distances, and can't stand for more than 3 minutes without getting dizzy.  I'm tired of this and medicine is not helping.</p>
<p>The doctors have her on prednisone (and a host of other medications) and it's doing nothing but, hurting her more.  Prednisone has given her osteperosis, diabetes, and shingles.  The weight gain from the medications and inability to move because of the oxygen and dizzy spells, can be fixed with juicing.  Many people have been cured or have extremely improved by juicing and turning to healthy foods for healing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What SHE Needs</h3>
<p>She needs to get off of these medications and heal her body but, juicing is expensive.  She is disabled and cannot afford what is needed to successfully juice for 90 days.</p>
<ul>
<li>Juicing all of her meals will cost about $20 per day.</li>
<li>Also the medications have caused a lot of dental problems and she needs dentures.  Any donations that exceed the goal for juicing will go towards dental work to make her smile again.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>I WILL WORK FOR IT</strong></h3>
<p><strong>I am a graphics designer and I am willing to work in exchange for your help.  I can design a logo for your business in exchange for a $30 donation.  I will design your logo and business card for a $100 donation.  I will create a website for you to see her progress.  Check out some of my work:</strong></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Like I said before, she is only 48 years old.  As her only child, I need her.  My mother has so much life to live.  When I do have children, they have to know her like I did as a child.  She was and still is the best mother in the world.  My mom has always been a giving person.  Everyone that knows her, loves her.  I just want her to be able to lose weight, get off of these dangerous medications, and smile again!  Seems simple, right?  Please help us!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute financially, please spread the word.  Post this to your website, facebook, twitter, etc.  If you know any dental professionals or produce companies willing to contribute to this cause, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3>UPDATE -</h3>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has supported Jayde's wheelchair fund - we have exceeded the original goal! You can still contribute until the end of May, and every bit of support helps greatly. Jayde has now ordered her new wheelchair and is eagerly awaiting its arrival. Our original goal was as low as possible, so any further contributions go directly towards the rest of the cost of the chair, helping Jayde keep some of her savings in the bank, and to set aside a fund for maintenance or repairs.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<h3>About Jayde</h3>
<p>Jayde was an avid runner, training for her first half marathon in August 2008 when she suffered an extensive DVT (blood clot) in her leg, which left her permanently disabled. She has essentially lost the use of that leg, is in constant pain and now requires a wheelchair to get around. </p>
<p>Jayde loved to run, but she doesn't get much of that sense of freedom anymore. She   has been largely housebound since her DVT. Her current wheelchair is heavy, cumbersome, difficult to control and painful to wheel for more than a few minutes. The hard rubber wheels and castors catch on every crack or pebble and threaten to dump her over.</p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
</div>
<div>

</div></div>","UPDATE -
Thank you to everyone who has supported Jayde's wheelchair fund - we have exceeded the original goal! You can still contribute until the end of May, and every bit of support helps greatly. Jayde has now ordered her new wheelchair and is eagerly awaiting its arrival. Our original goal was as low as possible, so any further contributions go directly towards the rest of the cost of the chair, helping Jayde keep some of her savings in the bank, and to set aside a fund for maintenance or repairs.
 

About Jayde
Jayde was an avid runner, training for her first half marathon in August 2008 when she suffered an extensive DVT (blood clot) in her leg, which left her permanently disabled. She has essentially lost the use of that leg, is in constant pain and now requires a wheelchair to get around. 
Jayde loved to run, but she doesn't get much of that sense of freedom anymore. She   has been largely housebound since her DVT. Her current wheelchair is heavy, cumbersome, difficult to control and painful to wheel for more than a few minutes. The hard rubber wheels and castors catch on every crack or pebble and threaten to dump her over.
What We Need 


A Litestream wheelchair with spoke wheels, mountain bike tires, natural fit push rims and a hard formed back will cost $4300.
Though Jayde is on a limited income, she is determined and has carefully saved $2650, which leaves $1650 left to be raised. 
Any contributions will help, and will go directly towards Jayde's new wheelchair. If the goal is not reached by May 31, she will have to defer the purchase by several months until she can save the rest. She'll still get the wheelchair, but will have to wait until next spring to get outside.
Alberta Aids to Daily Living (AADL) would provide some support towards a new chair, but they would then own it and (like her current chair), Jayde would not be allowed to modify or repair it. For her own sense of agency, Jayde needs to own her own wheelchair.
A Wheelchair to Change Her Life
The impact of a new chair would be huge! Imagine looking out the window and seeing a beautiful sunny day, but not being able to experience it because the world is dangerous - the whole experience would leave you exhausted, frustrated and in pain. 
That is Jayde's world.
A new wheelchair would allow Jayde to get to places that now she can only dream of. She would love to get out to her old running routes, explore Edmonton's extensive bike paths, and be healthy and active once more. To go to the farmer's markets or zoo with her son, to simply be able to move.
Summers around here are far too short! Please help Jayde get a new wheelchair as soon as possible, to hit the trails with her 13 year old son once more, rip up the bike paths, visit the parks, and start training towards her new goal of someday wheeling a marathon.

His mother is spending every minute with him, and trying to make things work out financially while he is battling cancer. I think it is terrible that a child has to fight cancer at such a delicate age. Not just a young age, but an age where life is coming together for them. I would like to take just a small amount of pressure off of Kari, his mother, by doing this fundraiser for them.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>On June 6th, 2012 Tyler was taken to the local Emergency Room complaining of back pain. They took xrays and sent Tyler home. On June 9th, Tyler was taken back to the local ER because when he woke up he could not walk. Tyler was then sent to Mott's Childrens Hospital in Michigan. At Motts, they took alot of tests, and immediately took Tyler up to emergency surgery. The only thing Kari (mom) knew at that time was that there was a tumor wrapped around his spine, and it had to be removed. It was found that Tyler had Ewings Sarcoma, which is a rare and aggressive form of cancer.</h3>
<h3>The surgeon could not get all of the tumor, and chemotherapy needed to be started immediately. The tumor damaged his disc which has caused Tyler to have issues with his left leg and right arm.  Tyler needs to have an operation in order to fix his C7 disc in his neck, but that will have to wait. The doctors wanted Tyler to start chemo immediately.So for now, it is hard for Tyler to ride because of the discomfort in his arm and leg. He isn't able to lift his arm up and seems to, at times, not have control of his arm movements. Tyler is also wearing a neck brace until the operation can be completed.  </h3>
<h3>Tyler is to go to Mott's Childrens Hospital on Tuesdays for 48 hour chemo, and go home on either Thursday or Friday. Then he stays home for a week, then comes back to the hospital for 5 day chemo.  He was to start radiation along with chemo this week, but because of counts dropping, it was put off another week. He has to do the chemo for a year! After that year, Tyler will still have to have scans, tests, etc for the next 5 years.</h3>
<h3>As if the cancer wasn't enough,  Motts Hospital is almost a 2 hour drive one way for Tyler and his mom, Kari. They are driving this, if there are no complications, back and forth a couple of times a week. However, if Tyler gets a temperature, she has to take him in, which is what happened this past week.</h3>
<h3>It is not only tough because of the ride, or the cost of gas, but it hurts Tyler to ride. For this reason, she tries to do therapy at home with him 3x a week.</h3>
<h3>There are 5 in this family. Mom, Stepdad, and 3 children including Tyler. Tyler is a typical 14 year old boy, who really has better things to do than to be fighting cancer. It is common for teenagers fighting tumors to become depressed and angry. Tyler knows it isn't just tough on him, but on his whole family.</h3>
<h3>Tyler has a heart of gold. The nurse mentioned having the eye doctor come in to see him, and his response was that if it cost money, then to not do it. He also changed his Christmas list (there is that typical 14 year old boy, already thinking about Christmas) to used and cheap items to be able to help his parents out.</h3>
<h3>Tyler needs to be able to completely focus on fighting this cancer. No 14 year old child should have to worry about fighting cancer, but the sad reality is that it happens every day. There is nothing that we, as family, friends and facebook followers can do about fighting it for him. However, he definitely should not be worrying about finances. No matter what his parents tell him, he will worry because that is the type of HERO that he is. That is where we, family, friends and facebook followers can help.  They need help on co-pays, gas, food (when at hospital), general expenses and some fun things for Tyler to do while he is battling and conquering this monster.</h3>
<h3>If you would love to help, but just can't financially at the moment, there are ways you can still contribute, they are:</h3>

<p>Your body is not your enemy and you do not have to fight against it. Your body and its mechanisms have evolved with one goal in mind: To survive! When you add some extra fat on your waist or legs, it is because the body receives signals that tells it to store away food as energy for later use. Recently, our diets have seen a surge in sugar and vegetable oils which overloads our systems and arteries and puts our body's metabolism out of balance. These extra sugars are converted into fat in the body through a hormone called insulin.</p>
<p><strong>How our bodies react to sugar</strong></p>
<p>What happens is that when we eat sugar, it goes into our blood stream and signals for the hormone insulin to be released. Insulin then allows the sugar to go into the cells and either become glycogen or triglycerides. Triglycerides are what the body stores as fat. </p>
<p><strong>How is CO2 Measured and why is it better?</strong></p>

<p>Using a smart wearable that takes in heart rate, the app can convert the heart rate into carbon dioxide (CO2). The triglycerides mentioned earlier are eventually broken down in the body using oxygen. If you follow the breakdown of the triglycerides, you can see that they breakdown into CO2, H2O, and energy. More than 80% of that fat lose is released as carbon dioxide. Hence, by estimating the CO2 loss, it is possible to get a much more accurate representation of mass loss than the common method of counting steps.</p>

3 easy steps to lose weight!


At Mindful Projects LLC, we are aiming to address the obesity epidemic without requiring drastic lifestyle changes. Our goal is to offer a program that empowers users with the knowledge to understand how their bodies respond to diet and exercise. Real Science. Real Results. 
Obesity, Diabetes and Heart Disease! Does this have to be the Future?
Obesity is a national crisis that threatens our society's well-being and the economy. People that are trying to lose weight or get their cholesterol levels under control are often faced with little to no scientific guidance; instead, they are flooded with new fads and ""proven"" techniques that promise unattainable goals. 
The most common approach is counting calories. The idea is that if one can simply ""burn"" more calories than they consume, then they will lose weight. The problem with the ""calories in / calories out"" method is that: (1) it ignores chemistry, i.e. the type of foods consumed; (2) it does not take into account changes in metabolic rate over time; and (3) it has been shown time and again not to work in the long run. Worse yet, those that cannot sustain a semi-starvation diet or extreme work-out regiment are often blamed for lacking will power. 

How does Breathe-Fit work? 


 
How does insulin tracking work? 


Your body is not your enemy and you do not have to fight against it. Your body and its mechanisms have evolved with one goal in mind: To survive! When you add some extra fat on your waist or legs, it is because the body receives signals that tells it to store away food as energy for later use. Recently, our diets have seen a surge in sugar and vegetable oils which overloads our systems and arteries and puts our body's metabolism out of balance. These extra sugars are converted into fat in the body through a hormone called insulin.
How our bodies react to sugar
What happens is that when we eat sugar, it goes into our blood stream and signals for the hormone insulin to be released. Insulin then allows the sugar to go into the cells and either become glycogen or triglycerides. Triglycerides are what the body stores as fat. 
How is CO2 Measured and why is it better?

Using a smart wearable that takes in heart rate, the app can convert the heart rate into carbon dioxide (CO2). The triglycerides mentioned earlier are eventually broken down in the body using oxygen. If you follow the breakdown of the triglycerides, you can see that they breakdown into CO2, H2O, and energy. More than 80% of that fat lose is released as carbon dioxide. Hence, by estimating the CO2 loss, it is possible to get a much more accurate representation of mass loss than the common method of counting steps.
Why are we passionate about solving the obesity epidemic?

The obesity epidemic affects everyone directly or indirectly. Heart disease and other fatal diseases directly related to diet are hovering over all of us. 
Who could benefit? 

If you are struggling with obesity and weight loss and your younger body is merely a distant memory, Breathe is for you. If you are satisfied with your overall weight but would like to lose a few pounds and then maintain your body mass, Breathe is for you. If you have recently been diagnosed with prediabetes, and your doctor recommends that you to ""Do something,"" Breathe is for you. If you are content with your body mass and weight but would like to know how diet and exercise really work, Breathe is for you!
Breathe allows users to set their own goals. In particular, it is designed for those on the go and that have a busy lifestyle. Further, it does not require that users completely eliminate their favorite foods. Instead, it offers a custom, quantitative diet that gets results by specifically targeting the mechanisms that underlie weight gain and weight loss.   
If you do not feel like you are reaching your goals, please send us an email and we will do our best to provide feedback.  
What will we do with the funding? 

Right now we have invested as much as we possibly can to make an application that can have an immense effect on people's lives. We have a lot of different ideas and upgrades planned that will make losing weight even easier and even more comprehensible. 
Our goal to make the business model sustainable, with maintenance and updates, is to reach 15000 subscribers by June 2019.

Tech Neck is the chronic pain in the neck caused by the forward head posture formed from overuse of technology. Simply put: our muscles, ligaments and spine are not designed to support our 10 pound head in a constant forward position. Tech Neck Symptoms include:
Chronic headaches & muscle aches
Radiating pain
Numbness/tingling
Strained neck muscles
Limited mobility
These symptoms also contribute to a decrease in healthy habits of our daily life:
Sleep Deprivation/Fatigue
Anxiety
Poor Work Performance
Loss of Focus
Decrease of Energy
Digestive Issues
Weight Gain

<p><strong>What are Desmoid Tumors</strong></p>
<p>Desmoid tumors are tumors that arise from cells called fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are found throughout our body and their main function is to provide structural support and protection to the vital organs such as lung, liver, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, skin, intestines etc. and they also play a critical role in wound healing. When fibroblast cells undergo mutations they can become cancerous and become desmoid tumors (also known as ""aggressive fibromatosis""). Desmoid tumors can arise in virtually any part of the body. These tumors often occur in women in their 30's, but can occur in anyone at any age. Desmoid tumors can be slow growing or extremely aggressive. They do not metastasize (move from one body part to another), and if slow growing they can be carefully watched by your physician. However, when they are aggressive they can cause life threatening problems or even death when they compress vital organs such as intestines, kidney, lungs, blood vessels, nerves etc.</p>

<p><span><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">There is no single accepted medical treatment for desmoid tumors</span></strong>. Numerous reports of individual cases show shrinkage or stabilization of tumor size or at least improvement in symptoms after a very wide variety of treatments.  Chemotherapy is a chemical drug that is usually injected in the veins.  A few chemotherapies that are commonly used include: doxorubicin, Doxil, dacarbazine, methotrexate, vinorelbine and vinblastine.  These are toxic chemotherapies that can have a wide range of short and long term side effects.  There have also been anecdotal reports of using sulindac (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) or anti-hormonal agents such as tamoxifen, however the true efficacy of these drugs have not been investigated in clinical trials.</span></p>

As a contributor you would want the same thing. Every package mailed out shall contain WHC brochure. Show WHC card and that brochure to your doctor and every doctor you encounter! Many of them already have an idea to enhance their services by switching to a smart card solution but many don't know where to start. WHC is an easy and quick solution!<br/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/279806/files/20131226171634-doctor-with-world-health-card.jpg?1388106994"" src="""" style=""width: 276.21px; height: 279px;""/></p><p>Doctor very happy to see another patient with WHC card!</p><p>Your cards delivery schedule:</p><h4>Delivery of personalized WHC smart cards and other parts shall start on February 15th 2014 (or sooner).</h4><p> </p><h4>

There are many screens and information visible and editable by a doctor. Here are just a few points:</p><ul>
<li>Rich content and easy flow of medical information</li>
<li>Secure validation of card holder's identity without presentation of any other documents</li>
<li>Instant validation of 2 independent insurance sources</li>
<li>Easy review of existing medications, chronic diseases, life critical illnesses</li>
<li>Medical journal and notes from previous visits</li>
<li>Review existing medications, secure e-prescription of new ones</li>
<li>Vaccination records</li>
<li>Instant claim facility</li>
</ul><p>All above and much more wrapped up in multiple languages which are available only a click away</p><p>Everything is in real time once the patient has inserted his/her card into the smart card reader and allowed the doctor to see the contents! As soon as the patient removes the card the information on the screen goes away. At this point the doctor is ready to see the next patient</p><p>Everybody knows that a doctor's time is very expensive. WHC saves that time, makes doctor's to be more efficient and see more patients. They can concentrate on providing better medical advice and not spend this time on writing up paper work!<br/></p><p>WHC is ideal for doctors who want to improve their practice by switching to smart card usage. </p><p>See below for typical doctor's Screen:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/279807/files/20131226172002-doctor-screen.png?1388107202"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>This is the first screen that populates after a patient has inserted their card into the reader - demo Screen</p><p>You can see that Stine is happy  because she showed up with a WHC card and now she is in good hands! The doctor will find out details about her health situation within seconds</p><p>Doctor's do not have to have Internet in order to handle WHC cards. They can literally be in the middle of a jungle, on top of a mountain or anywhere else as long as he or she has a computer capable of interacting with WHC cards. How great is that!?</p><p>Only time when it is ideal for doctor's to have an internet connection is when they want to verify insurance status of patients in real time, but that is optional. This makes WHC ideal for undeveloped countries with scarce or non existent communications infra structure</p><h4>WHC - MAKING MORE CASE FOR DOCTORS</h4><p>There are more opportunities for doctors than it meets the eye. Typical US or Canadian family doctor has about 4000 - 8000 patients in their files</p><ul>
<li>Doctor's access control card</li>
<li>Validate patient's identity in seconds</li>
<li>Validate 2 different insurance accounts live</li>
<li>Review existing medications, med plans, allergies, life critical info</li>
<li>Check medical notes from other doctors</li>
<li>Create claim for insurance in one minute or less</li>
<li>Use ICD-10 International medical codes </li>
<li>Earn extra income by selling cards and extending their validity</li>
<li>Switch their own practice to WHC Suite practically overnight</li>
<li>In WHC case size does not matter! It can be few hundred patients or regional hospital with 100000 patients. All the same for WHC</li>
<li>Doctor will never run into ""I didn't know about that allergy"" dangerous situation ever again</li>
<li>Direct payment to account is part of the doctor's control card</li>
<li>Doctor can see more patients a day and earn more money</li>
<li>Everything is HIPAA (USA) and PIPEDA (Canada) privacy compliant</li>
<li>No licences, monthly or yearly fees to pay<br/><br/>and much, much more in multiple languages with beautiful Interface</li>

According to the most recent research into the cost of medical mistakes in terms of lives lost, 210,000 Americans are killed by preventable hospital errors each year.
When deaths related to diagnostic errors, errors of omission, and failure to follow guidelines are included, the number skyrockets to an estimated 440,000 preventable deaths each year!Imagine,There would be something which can protect you to a certain point against medical errors!Imagine,You could make health care faster, safer, more efficient and less costly!... That it already exists !
World Health Card doctor's starter kit Doctor happy to see patient with WHC CardHealthcare is more expensive by the minute and further away from the reach of ordinary citizens. It is time for people to do something for the people! We are more than confident that a solution for many problems is in the smart card system we invented. Instead of spending billions on national data centers, we created medical records that patients can carry in their pocket anywhere. Can't be more convenient and handy than that! This concept shall produce instant positive results. Project implementation has defined, finite cost and countless benefits to : patients, doctors, EMS, insurance, therapists, nurses, pharmacy, travelers ... even to the Government. OUR GOALSOur goal is to introduce WHC cards to as many persons as possible in short time. Many people reading this page shall recognize how useful smart health card is and how close we are to have it in many hands and pockets. At the same time funds raised shall be used to equip 5000 most visited tourist destinations world wide with doctor's starter kits so cards holders can utilize their cards sooner. When we say destinations we mean many cities and attractions millions of people live in or visit. It can be anything from Key West , Miami, Disney World,Tokyo, Bangkok, Bejing, Munich, Sidney, India, Manila, Bali, Mallorca, Moscow, International Airports, business and tourist Centers  ... you name it and we'll do itCard holder that became a patient after sudden accident or illness will find re-assuring fact that anywhere he goes WHC shall be welcomed and accepted. Feel safer when travelling. That is a major part of our plan! WHERE IS WHC PROJECT AT THIS VERY MOMENT?We are at the point where after 2.5 years of development our funds are almost depleted and the project is almost finished. Software is in the last few stages of completion. Manuals have to be written and printed. Delivery boxes prepared, labeled, USB sticks printed, registration WEB site prepared for and hosted, tech support organized. Ordering logistics setup, big advertising started up, instructional videos prepared. Personalization team has to be hired, setup with space, computers and all the office tools.Finally, the most expensive items come in 6 dollar figures or more: molds and production of the smart card readers has to be prepared, actual WHC cards initial stock production planned and ordered. All those things require a lot of effort and some serious coin.We need your help to finish it off and release WHC into the public. Our startup is about health care so sooner we start sooner system will have positive impact on people's lives. World Health Card patient self service kiosk - prototype (real working model)TECHNOLOGY BEHIND WHCFocal point of WHC project is smart card. It is miniature computer loaded with data structured as mini data base. Chip cards are perfect media to securely store, retrieve and change information on demand. Even more access to stored data is completely controlled by card holder. Multiple levels of security prevent everybody else from accessing saved info in case card is found or stolen. WHC uses bank or military kind of security or better!WHC magic takes a place in few square millimetres in the centre of microprocessor based chip. Whole card looks like credit card and fits everybody's pocket. Actual smart card technology was invented in Europe in approximately 1980. So we didn't invent concept of chip health cards but we sure perfected it to new levels!WHO MAKES WHC PARTS?We had in mind of helping each of our own domestic economies, so here is a breakdown of the parts:
Smart cards - Canada
Chips for Smart Cards - Germany
Patient's PIN PAD smart card reader - USA
Patient's biometric smart card reader - USA

WHC is an easy and quick solution! Doctor very happy to see another patient with WHC card!Your cards delivery schedule:Delivery of personalized WHC smart cards and other parts shall start on February 15th 2014 (or sooner). 
    WHAT IS IN IT FOR DOCTORSAfter patient, the doctor is second person to use the card to the fullest capabilities. There are many screens and information visible and editable by a doctor. Here are just a few points:
Rich content and easy flow of medical information
Secure validation of card holder's identity without presentation of any other documents
Instant validation of 2 independent insurance sources
Easy review of existing medications, chronic diseases, life critical illnesses
Medical journal and notes from previous visits
Review existing medications, secure e-prescription of new ones
Vaccination records
Instant claim facility
All above and much more wrapped up in multiple languages which are available only a click awayEverything is in real time once the patient has inserted his/her card into the smart card reader and allowed the doctor to see the contents! As soon as the patient removes the card the information on the screen goes away. At this point the doctor is ready to see the next patientEverybody knows that a doctor's time is very expensive. WHC saves that time, makes doctor's to be more efficient and see more patients. They can concentrate on providing better medical advice and not spend this time on writing up paper work!WHC is ideal for doctors who want to improve their practice by switching to smart card usage. See below for typical doctor's Screen:This is the first screen that populates after a patient has inserted their card into the reader - demo ScreenYou can see that Stine is happy  because she showed up with a WHC card and now she is in good hands! The doctor will find out details about her health situation within secondsDoctor's do not have to have Internet in order to handle WHC cards. They can literally be in the middle of a jungle, on top of a mountain or anywhere else as long as he or she has a computer capable of interacting with WHC cards. How great is that!?Only time when it is ideal for doctor's to have an internet connection is when they want to verify insurance status of patients in real time, but that is optional. This makes WHC ideal for undeveloped countries with scarce or non existent communications infra structureWHC - MAKING MORE CASE FOR DOCTORSThere are more opportunities for doctors than it meets the eye.

    WHAT ABOUT PHARMACY?Our system integrates usage of the card with pharmacies. All prescriptions are written electronically and confirm dispensing of prescriptions as well. ""Creative"" people with Photoshop will be out of luck trying to make up their ""own"" prescriptions and life threatening overdosage situations. Fake prescriptions are a matter of the past and are not possible any more with WHC.Needless to say, prescriptions are electronic, fully portable, encrypted and very clear to pharmacists. Medication dispensing is confirmed by features in the card.Besides that, when going anywhere all prescriptions are in you pocket, safely stored in WHC card. So if a traveler ever runs out of medication a local pharmacy in any country will be able to see and read the prescription in their native language. How great is that?WHAT IS IT IN FOR INSURANCE?Health insurance companies are the ones to feel the biggest money effect from WHC usage! WHC system has integrated many real life anti fraud techniques that allows system to save millions or hundreds of millions to insurers. In the end of the day whoever pays the medical bill will get huge savings. Being that Obamacare or Sun Life or Medicare or some other insurance company. Those savings will create for the first time ever rates to go down instead of going up all the time.

Every person on Earth should have one. It is a chip card that securely carries individual medical records. WHC card is patented and contains surprising amount of innovation and functionality not found in any other health cards anywhere! Almost every nation in Europe has health smart card system for their citizens but mostly for administrative purposes. WHC concept is very special with personal medical info actually being where it belongs, and that's in the card holder's wallet. Not sitting in some remote server managed by strangers and just waiting to be hacked and stolen by fraudsters. WHC card is also very unique because it is created and maintained by it's owner. It has quadruple protection against stealing: 
Records are encrypted

There is a picture of the card holder inside the chip

PIN

Biometric token (never leaves a chip, nobody can steal it)

More security:
Only medical professionals can see content of the card and only after patient's explicit approval! 

They can write into the card, but only to locations allowed by the system. 

Data are stored in the chip only! 

Nobody can track down the card or steal data from the chip. 

Found or stolen card is useless to third party.

Read more about WHC System on this WEB site: http://www.world-health-card.caMAKING A CASE FOR SMART HEALTH CARDSDo we really need to do it? By now everybody should understand immense benefits that card like that brings to card holder and health care as an system. Here is more facts:
There is about 80 million of smart health cards in Germany. Every citizen has one

There is about 65 million smart health cards in France. They call it Vitale

There is 24 million smart cards in Taiwan

There is 2 million card in Slovenia

... basically every country in Europe already implemented smart cards. Germans and French were first ones to start and now they are on 3rd or 4th generation of cards.HOW DOES WHC COMPARE TO OTHER ONES?Here we compiled 3 of the most popular smart health cards in the world today against World Health Card. Feature by feature:WHY WORLD HEALTH CARD MATTERS TO YOU? It really does to you, your family members and everybody you know. First and foremost WHC saves lives. Medical emergencies happen any time, anywhere. Not only in your home town but also when visiting other places or traveling abroad. WHC will enable patient (everybody is patient at some points of life :( ) , to have his/her medical info, medical notes, prescriptions, notes of allergies, emergency contacts, insurance and much more available at any time. Not only EMS but any doctor should have access to card records. Their job is to save lives and provide quality medical care based on precise medical facts. The lack of same can impede doctor's ability to help. Every card has myriad of useful information written right into the chip. There is about 1400 bits of medical info securely encrypted inside. Card could cut check-in process at the doctor's office from ten minutes to mere seconds. Patient using WHC kiosk, prototypeSelf serving PC or kiosk will greet patients in 19 different languages and let patient express his or her reasons for visit in easy, non stressful way. Doctor will serve WHC patient faster and better than others. Referrals to other doctors, medication plans, prescriptions are all electronic with no possibility of fraud. Billing to insurance all electronic, quick and very efficient. EVEN CRUISE SHIPS WILL LIKE WHC!Why, for simple reason that every week they meet new 2000-4000 people and inevitable somebody will get ill. Yes, cruise ships have doctor and nurses for their guests but being on high seas makes their job quite hard.For example there is about 26 million people in USA suffering from diabetes. It is just to easy not know that fact and give confused person in distress some medication that alone is not dangerous but combined with existing pre-condition becomes deadly.By accepting WHC cards they will be able to treat patients with more medical information available, with greater confidence and provide quality service everybody deserves. THERE IS EVEN MORE ...Last but not least feature is that WHC preserves a nature. All records and  transactions are electronic so when in hands of thousands of people countless trees will be spared. No more photocopying, clipboards, storage of mountains of papers, toner waste. Cards are small in size with big heart. PVC used can be recycled, gold from chips recovered. Packaging we envisioned shall be made of fully recyclable materials so it will not end in landfillshereFINAL WORDSFinally, help us to help you!

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Hi there! We should probably get acquainted before moving on to the fun stuff. The Climb for Kibale Team is a group of Canadian students who have recently participated in the Canadian Field Studies in Africa (CFSIA) Program, a term of experiential learning in East Africa. To meet the Climb for Kibale Team, check out the ""Gallery"" tab.</p>
<p>Each year after the Program's completion, a number of the students go on to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. This year, CFSIA 2015 is mixing things up a bit. We've decided to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in an attempt to raise funds for the Kibale Health &amp; Conservation Clinic, an initiative close to our hearts.</p>
<p>CFSIA students first encountered the Kibale Health &amp; Conservation Clinic in February while spending 12 amazing days studying in Kibale National Park, Uganda. The Clinic is located just within the border of the park, and a two-minute walk from the village of Kanyawara. Built in 2007, the Kibale Health &amp; Conservation Clinic services approximately 6,000 community members, providing them with nearby, reliable health care and several education outreach programs. The Clinic is staffed by two full-time nurses, amicably known as Nurse Lucy and Nurse Dennis, and two Clinical Officers, Patrick and Stephen. Together, these individuals work tirelessly to serve the communities surrounding the park. </p>
<p>Why are healthcare services so desperately needed in Kanyawara and other villages? And why should you choose to support our cause? Consider these Ugandan stats:</p>
<p>- The average life expectancy of an individual is 45 years old </p>
<p>- 30% of all deaths among children aged 2-4 years old are caused by malaria, which can be easily prevented or treated</p>
<p>- 26% of children under the age of 5 years old are undernourished </p>
<p>- Community members must walk an average of 15 kilometres to reach the nearest hospital from Kanyawara village </p>
<p>Today, the Health &amp; Conservation Clinic relies on outside funding in order to continue delivering its high-in-demand health services and education outreach  programs to local communities. This is where you come in.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>On average, it costs $700 per month to keep the Kibale
Health &amp; Conservation Clinic up and running. Our
goal is to raise $5,600, which would 1) fund a total of 8 months
of nurses' and Clinical Officers' salaries and 2) ensure that the
Clinic's required list of medical supplies is purchased for this same period of time, including but certainly
not limited to anti-malarial medications, contraceptives,
and HIV/AIDS testing kits.</p>
<p>So what's in it for you? Besides the knowledge that your contribution is directly benefiting community members, we've set up a few perks to thank you for your support (see right-hand side of page). </p>
<p>What happens if we're unsuccessful in reaching our goal of $5,600? Fear not! Any and all funds raised will still be sent directly to the Kibale Health &amp; Conservation Clinic to help cover costs.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The Climb for Kibale Team is incredibly excited to be raising funds for a cause we feel passionately about, a result of having had the chance to personally visit the Kibale Health &amp; Conservation Clinic. We are committed to doing our part in making certain that the Clinic continues to provide its healthcare services in the future, crucial to community members. We also recognize the importance of long-term commitment, and hope that the success of this campaign (fingers crossed!) will inspire future CFSIA students to continue supporting the Kibale Health &amp; Conservation Clinic. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
<p>As much as the Climb for Kibale Team would appreciate your monetary donation, spreading our campaign to others through social media or by word of mouth would also be of great benefit to the project, and something we would be sincerely grateful for.</p>
<p>Please like the Climb for Kibale Facebook Page, share this campaign, spread the energy, and help us reach our goal. Anything helps!</p>

<p>Hearing Sounds, is an electronic headset that helps children hear their speech more clearly. It does this by amplifying their voice and sending it to dual earphones.   The volume is adjustable, fitting the child's needs.

</p>
<p>
This headset can be used by others as well. Singers, MC's, Broadcasters, and more, allowing them to focus in on their voices in order to make necessary improvements. <i>Patent pending.</i> 
</p>
<p>
<b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>
<br/>    Hello! I am Bill Patton, designer of a unique
speech-hearing device called <i>Hearing
Sounds<sup>TM</sup></i>. I am an inventor who has always been interested in
creating useful devices to help improve peoples’ lives. Over the past few
years, I have been working on several new inventions that I believe will be very
useful to others and my new <i><b>Hearing
Sounds</b><sup>TM</sup></i><sup>  </sup>device
is one of them!</p>
<p><b>                                                            MY STORY</b></p>
<p>
While growing up, my older brother and I both
struggled with speech problems. Since I looked up to him, I wanted to be <i>like </i>him, so I would <i>mimic</i> his hard to understand speech pattern. Later, with the
help of a Speech Therapist, I was able to overcome this problem, and at the age
of 27 I became an Electrical Controls Engineer. The knowledge and experience
that I gained from that job helped me develop various inventions that I
believed would be useful to people. However, in those days there was no way to
make interested contributors aware of these
inventions. But now there is!
</p>
<p><b>ONE PAST INVENTION</b></p>
<p>
One
of the many inventions I have created is a washing machine overflow device
called <i>Stop Flow<sup>TM</sup></i>. If you
want to do a load of laundry while you are away from home, there’s no need to worry about a flooding
problem because if the washer or drain pipe starts to overflow, an automatic sensor
will interrupt the power to the washer to shut it off. It’s a simple device that is <i>very</i> easy to use! Just plug the unit into a
wall outlet and plug the washer into the unit, and wrap the sensor band
around the drain hose (discharge tube). It’s <i>that</i>
simple and easy! That is just <i>one</i> of
the <i>many</i> inventions I have created
that would be useful to others!
</p>
<p>
My newest device, the <i>Hearing Sounds<sup>TM  </sup></i>headset would be very helpful for
people with speech problems. <i>Hearing</i><i> Sounds<sup>TM  </sup></i>can also be used by
professional singers, announcers and MC’s so they can hear their voice pitch
and adjust
it <i>before</i> audiences hear them so they
sound their <i>best!</i>
</p>
<p><b>SUMMARY</b></p>
<p>
This project is very dear
to me. Since I was a Special Education student while growing up, I don’t
need to go into detail of how <i>difficult</i>
it was to have a speech problem while attending middle school and high school.
I began to realize that since I had struggled with this problem there were
probably <i>others </i>that were struggling
too! So, I did some research online and I found hundreds, if not <i>thousands,</i> of children with speech
problems, and I want to help them!
</p>
<p>
My <i>Hearing Sounds<sup>TM</sup></i> device will help children <i>hear</i> the sounds they are making so they
can learn to <i>speak</i> more
clearly!  This device will also give teachers a new useful tool to help
students with speech impediments.
</p>
<p>Children are the future
and having the ability to speak clearly and articulately will help those with
speech problems succeed and enjoy a better quality of life! So, I am asking contributors to help make a difference in the
lives of these children so they can be all they can be!</p>
<p>
As someone who once
struggled with a speech problem while growing up, I <i>know</i> how important it is to be
able to speak clearly, so will you join with other contributors on this
campaign to help me get my <i>Hearing</i><i> Sounds<sup>TM</sup></i> device to those who
need it? Will you help <i>me</i> help <i>them?</i>
</p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></p>
<p>
We need help from contributors like you to take our 3D design to manufacturers to have the molds
produced as well as pay for the costs of packaging and shipping to distributors, such as Amazon.com.  We currently have a 3D prototype for
testing, which is being tested by Speech Therapists.  We have tested in schools, churches and private patient sessions.
</p>
<p><b>HOW OUR PRODUCT WILL HELP</b></p>
<p>
If you know anyone who struggles with a
speech problem, please think of them and help <i>us</i> help <i>them</i> since there
are a vast number of people that have this problem. We strongly believe that

It does this by amplifying their voice and sending it to dual earphones.   The volume is adjustable, fitting the child's needs.



This headset can be used by others as well. Singers, MC's, Broadcasters, and more, allowing them to focus in on their voices in order to make necessary improvements. Patent pending. 


Introduction

    Hello! I am Bill Patton, designer of a unique
speech-hearing device called Hearing
SoundsTM. I am an inventor who has always been interested in
creating useful devices to help improve peoples’ lives. Over the past few
years, I have been working on several new inventions that I believe will be very
useful to others and my new Hearing
SoundsTM  device
is one of them!
                                                            MY STORY

While growing up, my older brother and I both
struggled with speech problems. Since I looked up to him, I wanted to be like him, so I would mimic his hard to understand speech pattern. Later, with the
help of a Speech Therapist, I was able to overcome this problem, and at the age
of 27 I became an Electrical Controls Engineer. The knowledge and experience
that I gained from that job helped me develop various inventions that I
believed would be useful to people. However, in those days there was no way to
make interested contributors aware of these
inventions. But now there is!

ONE PAST INVENTION

One
of the many inventions I have created is a washing machine overflow device
called Stop FlowTM. If you
want to do a load of laundry while you are away from home, there’s no need to worry about a flooding
problem because if the washer or drain pipe starts to overflow, an automatic sensor
will interrupt the power to the washer to shut it off. It’s a simple device that is very easy to use! Just plug the unit into a
wall outlet and plug the washer into the unit, and wrap the sensor band
around the drain hose (discharge tube). It’s that
simple and easy! That is just one of
the many inventions I have created
that would be useful to others!


My newest device, the Hearing SoundsTM  headset would be very helpful for
people with speech problems. Hearing SoundsTM  can also be used by
professional singers, announcers and MC’s so they can hear their voice pitch
and adjust
it before audiences hear them so they
sound their best!

SUMMARY

This project is very dear
to me. Since I was a Special Education student while growing up, I don’t
need to go into detail of how difficult
it was to have a speech problem while attending middle school and high school.
I began to realize that since I had struggled with this problem there were
probably others that were struggling
too! So, I did some research online and I found hundreds, if not thousands, of children with speech
problems, and I want to help them!


My Hearing SoundsTM device will help children hear the sounds they are making so they
can learn to speak more
clearly!  This device will also give teachers a new useful tool to help
students with speech impediments.

Children are the future
and having the ability to speak clearly and articulately will help those with
speech problems succeed and enjoy a better quality of life! So, I am asking contributors to help make a difference in the
lives of these children so they can be all they can be!

As someone who once
struggled with a speech problem while growing up, I know how important it is to be
able to speak clearly, so will you join with other contributors on this
campaign to help me get my Hearing SoundsTM device to those who
need it? Will you help me help them?

WHAT WE NEED

We need help from contributors like you to take our 3D design to manufacturers to have the molds
produced as well as pay for the costs of packaging and shipping to distributors, such as Amazon.com.  We currently have a 3D prototype for
testing, which is being tested by Speech Therapists.  We have tested in schools, churches and private patient sessions.

HOW OUR PRODUCT WILL HELP

If you know anyone who struggles with a
speech problem, please think of them and help us help them since there
are a vast number of people that have this problem. We strongly believe that
our Hearing SoundsTM
device could help many and that this marketed unit
will give hope to those struggling
with speech problems so they can speak
more clearly.

                           WE NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE IT HAPPEN!

We know all too well how difficult it
can be to contribute funding to people
you hardly know. But we are asking for your help on this campaign so that
others can have a better quality of
life! We have the people in place to move forth with this project and
there are manufacturers waiting for the go-ahead to start production on the Hearing SoundsTM headset. All
we need now is for you, the
contributors, to make it happen!

                                          OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP

If you can't help with funding you can
still help by getting the word out to others about our Hearing SoundsTM device and campaign so they may want to
contribute. Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools when telling
others about us!

So, if you can’t contribute funding, you can:
  • Help make a difference in someone else’s life!
  • Get the word out to others about our campaign.
  • Remind others to use the Indiegogo share tools.
That's all there is to it!
If everyone works together to
do what they can do, this project can
improve the lives of many!  So, thank
you very much for whatever you can do to help us, and God bless you for being willing to help!

Saving water, time, energy and space

Time-

Busy parents with newborns or toddlers know how important it is to save time where they can. And every parent knows the value of even a few minutes saved in a busy schedule. Baby Bath Saver will enable you to create a baby bath in your family bath filled with water and ready for use in moments. So why waste time filling the whole bath for your baby when half or less will do?

Astonishingly this is enough water to fill 3,250 Olympic sized swimming pools. Imagine the overwhelming saving over 10 years.






Energy & Money 

Heating water in our homes accounts for 25% of all energy usage 
Using the Baby Bath Saver to bathe your baby will make a genuine reduction to every parent’s household heating bill and collectively can make a substantial contribution to the nation’s energy saving requirement.
The Baby Bath Saver barrier will pay for itself over and over during its lifetime.






Why use the Baby Bath Saver?


1. Baby Bath Saver will accompany your Baby while growing from a newborn to a toddler.
2. Baby Bath Saver saves you precious water andvaluable time as you only need to fill the section of bath required.
3. Baby Bath Saver is easy to fit anywhere within the bath to create your Baby's own space.
4. Baby Bath Saver is space-saving, easy to store and can conveniently travel anywhere with you.
5. Baby Bath Saver is very practical, making it a must for any busy parent.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Graham Richard Nichols was born September 3, 2000 after a perfect pregnancy. We had prepared for everything; almost everything. Graham's birth was a planned home birth and everything was perfect. After a short labor, Graham emerged with a sweet wimper and a calming demeanor. We looked him over...2 legs, 2 arms, 10 toes, 10 fingers, yup, he was a he. Then finally, we looked at his beautiful face. His eyes were brown and dreamy, but where his mouth was ...it wasn't. Graham had an extremely large left-side cleft lip and palate and we didn't know what to do. Plans were made right away to pack up and head to Mission Hospital for an evaluation.</p>
<p>We were scared.</p>
<p>After about a week, with the help of family and friends, we found Dr. David Matthews in Charlotte, NC. He eased our fears and has been one of our 'true heroes' since that time. Dr. Matthews has performed several surgeries, procedures and calming office visits over the last 12 (almost 13) years.</p>
<p>We have almost reached the end of Graham's reconstruction process. Graham is scheduled for the first of 2 surgeries on July 10, 2013. He will have a bone graft adhered to his hard palate to join the two sides. Normally this fusion of the L and R palate occurs in the womb. The second surgery will reconstruct his nose and allow him better breathing capabilities.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Have you decided to join Graham's Health Hero Team?</p>
<p>We will use ALL donations to pay for the medical bills we will receive from the 2 surgeries. Although we do have insurance, there will be a balance. </p>
<p>For those interested, we will be running the 'Graham's Health Hero Disc Golf Tournament'. It will be a one-day, one-round event filled with love and appreciation for our <strong><em>Heroes</em></strong>.</p>

Graham had an extremely large left-side cleft lip and palate and we didn't know what to do. Plans were made right away to pack up and head to Mission Hospital for an evaluation.
We were scared.
After about a week, with the help of family and friends, we found Dr. David Matthews in Charlotte, NC. He eased our fears and has been one of our 'true heroes' since that time. Dr. Matthews has performed several surgeries, procedures and calming office visits over the last 12 (almost 13) years.
We have almost reached the end of Graham's reconstruction process. Graham is scheduled for the first of 2 surgeries on July 10, 2013. He will have a bone graft adhered to his hard palate to join the two sides. Normally this fusion of the L and R palate occurs in the womb. The second surgery will reconstruct his nose and allow him better breathing capabilities.
 


What We Need & What You Get
Have you decided to join Graham's Health Hero Team?
We will use ALL donations to pay for the medical bills we will receive from the 2 surgeries. Although we do have insurance, there will be a balance. 
For those interested, we will be running the 'Graham's Health Hero Disc Golf Tournament'. It will be a one-day, one-round event filled with love and appreciation for our Heroes.
-Richmond Hill DGC on July 20, 2013
-go to https://www.facebook.com/GrahamsHealthHeroProject for tournament details and surgery updates.
 
-If our goal is not met, we will use all funds collected to aid with the medical bills.


The Love
There are no words to desciribe how James and I feel about your support.
Helping us with this financial burden will allow us to be at ease while we help our son to heal.
Thank you!

<br/><h3>This is our journey of sadness and of hope.<br/>
</h3>
<p>On behalf of my sister, Leigha, and
brother-in-law, Brandon, I am here to share their story and ask for your help.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Leigha and Brandon met when they
were just 12 years old and over the years, through growing up and growing
apart, they reconnected for a final time at age 25. Then, on May 9<sup>th</sup>,
2009, after two years of dating, Leigha and Brandon exchanged vows and
immediately planned on starting a family.</p>
<p>After many months of trying to
conceive, Leigha and Brandon were told by their doctor to begin looking into
alternative methods of conception. So, in late 2009 Leigha began her first
round of fertility shots. In late 2010 Leigha then began taking hormone injections
and doctors were able to extract two healthy eggs for fertilization. In January
2011 Leigha underwent her first round of in vetro fertilization. This, however,
would not be the happy ending they were hoping for. Only one embryo was
surviving and at 7 weeks that embryo, too, had resulted in a miscarriage.
Leigha and Brandon found out they had lost their baby on their second wedding
anniversary.</p>
<p>She then began another round of
fertility shots in October 2012. They were, again, excited to find out that they
were pregnant. And, again they were heartbroken when they miscarried on
Christmas day 2012.</p>
<p>Then in February 2013 Leigha found
out, once again, that she was pregnant. The surprise came when they found out
that they would be having twins. Everything was progressing smoothly and
everyone was growing and feeling fine. At 20 weeks they were finally able to
determine that they would be having a little boy, Xavier, and girl, Athena –
the best of both worlds. As the weeks passed they were looking and developing
well at all of their appointments. Then, at 24 weeks, our family got the shock
that we never expected - we had lost Xavier. Doctors are unclear about what
happened to our little boy, and our family still struggles to understand.
However, for the sake of Athena, doctors decided the best thing for her was to
keep her brother inside until she was ready to deliver.</p>
<p>Now, going to two separate doctors
every week, Leigha passes her 25<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy with no new
issues. Week 26, however, Leigha’s 32<sup>nd</sup> birthday, earned her a trip
to the hospital for the remainder of her pregnancy, as we learned she was 2cm
dilated. She was on a myriad of medications to help protect Athena, help her
develop and help to stop Leigha’s contractions. After a week in the hospital on
bed rest her situation began to get even more desperate.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, August 14<sup>th</sup>
Leigha was transferred to a birthing suite at 4cm dilated and having
contractions. Given magnesium to protect Athena’s brain and to stop
contractions, we were all holding our breath at this point. At the end of the
night we all felt optimistic that Leigha’s body would cooperate and Athena
would be able to hold on. Then at 4am on Thursday, August 15<sup>th</sup> we
received the call that Leigha was being prepped for surgery – she would be
delivering her babies at only 27 weeks.</p>
<p>Xavier was born at 4:40am and his
little sister was delivered at 4:42. Being three months premature, Athena was
cleaned up, placed in her incubator and wheeled straight to the NICU, not even
getting to see her Mommy.</p>
Although she was delivered breathing on her
own, she was intubated to stabilize her oxygen levels, given medicine to help open
and develop her lungs, and has spent most of her short life under a Bili light
for her jaundice. Her heart, brain and lungs are under close monitor and she is
already up to 2lbs 3oz.
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3>
<p>I am attempting to raise at least
$20,000 for my sister, brother-in-law and baby Athena to help them offset some
of the costs associated with the journey that they are taking.</p>
<p>Athena will be spending the first
three (3) months of her life growing and developing in the NICU. That, in
combination with Leigha’s countless hospital trips for complications, doctor
appointments, and her weeklong hospital stay is resulting in an incredible amount
of bills. While we are thankful that insurance is paying a portion, the
difference is still extremely substantial. They are living off of one income due
to Leigha’s complications and Brandon has missed countless time at work during
their journey. When baby Athena is finally able to join her mommy and daddy at
home, Brandon dreams of taking time off to spend with his little girl, but with
the mounting hospital bills that dream is not as realistic as it once was.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help to spread our story and
share this campaign with all of your family and friends – and request that they
do the same.</p>
<p>Anything and everything is
appreciated, from the bottom of our hearts. I cannot begin to thank you enough,
on behalf of my family, for your contribution, for your thoughts, prayers and
every ounce of help that has been given or offered.</p>
