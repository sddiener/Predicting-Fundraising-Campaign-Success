<h3>Loudermilk - Man With Gun Kills Three &amp; The Red Record on vinyl. Finally.</h3>
<p>Loudermilk started 1995. And from the moment they began, their dedication to making their music the best it could possibly be was clear to see (and hear, of course). I remember seeing the band in their earliest of days and being floored by just how impressive they were then. And they only continued to grow and learn and build and create and define this epic sound of theirs.</p>
<p>They accomplished something that is extremely rare for any band, they gained national, if not global, attention, signed to major labels, appeared on TV shows, and of course released two astoundingly excellent albums.</p>
<p><br/>It's taken us a long time to get us to this point. And honestly, there were times I really didn't know if we were going to be able to make it happen... to get us to where we are now... being able to launch a pre-order campaign to celebrate their albums on vinyl.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We've created new masters (which was a process in itself), really striking artwork, and dealt with the licensing aspects of getting these albums ready for you. It's definitely been a journey making this happen but, so proud to be able to share this campaign with you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We've come up with some really amazing (and extremely limited, in some cases) reward perks (like <strong>handwritten lyrics, test pressings, bonus tracks, and more!!</strong>) for you to choose from that we think you'll love and of course appreciate any and all help in making sure we can get the word out to help make this whole thing as successful as possible. </p>

<h3><strong>Who are Jesse's Divide?</strong></h3>
<p>Jesse’s Divide (JD) are a team of hard-working, hyphen-using, semi-professional musicians and friends of over 15 years. Performing with the intention of getting you pumped-up and feeling good :</p>
<p>When life beats you to your knees, let JD help you back up.</p>
<p>JD have performed and remain partnered with some of the biggest names in the UK’s underground rock movement, and are advocates of hard work paying dividends; the band stands aside from others with a live show combining a professional respect of their art with spillages of colourful humour. If you want a good time, and aren’t afraid to raise those glasses and shake your asses; then Jesse’s Divide are at your service.</p>
<p>Si (Vocals and Guitars) – Nick (Bass Guitar and Vocals) – Rob (Drums and Engineering) are JESSE’S DIVIDE. Writing songs about life, love and giant robots since 2012.</p>
<h3><strong>A full-length album, y'say?</strong></h3>
<p>That's right! The band currently has 4 EPs available to listen to (on Spotify, Google Music, Apple Music, anywhere really), each one a progression of their sound- from the angry proggy days of 2015's ""Metadome"" to the leaner hard-rock stylings of 2019's ""Spacewolf"". All these recordings have been self-funded, using money from the band's own pockets as well as any money made from gigs. JD are now looking to record and release a full-on 11 track album, with a supporting tour to promote it and play our music live to all you lovely folks.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p>We're looking to raise £1500. This will cover the following:</p>
<p>£1000- recording session at Lower Lane Studios. </p>
<p>£250- pressing of physical CDs</p>
<p>£250- Merchandise costs</p>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We've got a range of perks, from digital or physical copies of the album, through t-shirts and even exclusive live performances!</p>
</div><div><h3><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></h3></div><div>
<p>We've already begun the writing process for this album. 3 of the songs have already made their live show debut and are recorded, 3 more have been completed and the others are currently being worked on- they're in various states of completion, from ""we just need a few more lyrics"" to ""hey isn't this a cool riff?"". This is why we've set the recording date for February 2021; we don't want to rush them and end up with a set of songs we look back on six months later and wish we'd done something differently. When we hit the amount we're looking for here, that will be enough, combined with our gig earnings, to tip us over from WANTING to release the album to being able to afford it and get the lovely merch that we've listed.</p>

</h3><p>Apple has completely abandoned iPod, the original portable music player. Their vision is to integrate music playback into the iPhone. That's great for everyday music listeners, but what about those of us who don't want our music interrupted when a phone call, email, or text comes in? What about those of us who want the highest quality sound? We know when you start mashing up devices, compromises have to be made. What about those of us who love what high-resolution digital audio sounds like? We know iPhone just can't cut it.</p><p>We're trying to save the portable music player, and we're not alone.

</div></div>","Introducing Geek Wave: Something Different
Apple has completely abandoned iPod, the original portable music player. Their vision is to integrate music playback into the iPhone. That's great for everyday music listeners, but what about those of us who don't want our music interrupted when a phone call, email, or text comes in? What about those of us who want the highest quality sound? We know when you start mashing up devices, compromises have to be made. What about those of us who love what high-resolution digital audio sounds like? We know iPhone just can't cut it.We're trying to save the portable music player, and we're not alone. Along with friends like Sony, Pono, and Astell & Kern, we're dedicated to making a small, portable device that's created for one task: to uncompromisingly playback high resolution music.    Geek Wave is the evolution of the portable player. It provides uncompromised sound quality, while also loading you up with the portability, functionality, tech specs, and features LH Labs is known for. It plays PCM formats natively at up to 384 kHz sample rates in pure 32 bit depth. Beyond PCM, it plays DSD formats at up to 128 times the sample rate of a standard CD. Geek Wave doesn't mess around.Whether you're just looking to replace that old iPod you've been carrying since the early 2000's or you're a hardcorde, dyed-in-the-wool audio aficionado, Geek Wave mixes work with play, and is ready to party. Beer, cheeseburgers, and giddiness sold separately.The Highest Resolution Audio AvailableBeing the first company to bring the world a 32 bit/384 kHz plus DSD 128 component has it's advantages. Like it's predecessor, Da Vinci Dual DAC, Geek Wave is the only 32 bit / 384 kHz PCM capable, native DSD player in the world. What does that mean to you? It means you can feed it anything. From MP3's all the way up to DSD128 files.Geek Wave Architecture Future proof Digital processing stageAfter 4 months the campaign ended, we decided to upgrade the center piece of our digital audio to the new architecture that allow ""System On Module"" to work directly with the whole player. SOM looks like the example here.  What is the benefit?  That mean if we want, we could even upgrade your CPU inside Geek Wave without desoldering anything.Just pop one system ""card"" out, and plug the new one. Using the SOM architecture will increase our overall cost and integration design time, but definitely will provide the much better FUTURE PROOF capability.Sweet and rock solid Analog stageFrom the analysis and data from all other respectful competitors. Geek Wave is still one on the TOP. There are  few players could offer both Single-ended and Balanced output. But Geek Wave is the leading one at such a high output wattage. Also, by sharing the same the successful analog design of Geek Out V2/V2+ and Geek Pulse DAC, we prove this analog design could handle both power demanding headphones and noise sensitive IEMs very well.     Flexible ConfigurationsAs one of the senior digital audio player owners, you know what you want. We designed a flexible configuration that could fulfill different hopes and dreams.So there are hundreds of possibilities for Geek Wave's configuration. With five different set of modules or components.Module 1: Mother BoardModule 2: Flash memory module
 

Module 3: Battery module

 
Module 4: Chassis with different back material (main frame is T6061 Aluminum)
 

Module 5: Dock Station

 
 
   
  
Geek Wave Chassis Design

Geek Wave has the future proof SOM digital structure, with optional dual mono DAC engine and Femto clocks. It's definitely one of the kind. It took us a lot of reversions to find a sleep and nice chassis to fit its internal guts. 

All the physical buttons will be on the side. And most of the units will be thicker than current samples due to battery. We add some nice touch on chamfer and with a ""Wave"" concept on software user interface.  Geek Wave Highlighted Features
 
Pure Class A Amplification

Geek Wave has the most powerful pure Class A amplifier than any of its competitors. With different models to choose from, you can use Geek Wave with any headphone that's out there— from sensitive IEM's all the way up to large, esoteric cans.
Touch Control + Physical Buttons

Geek Wave's intuitive design allows you to control it in multiple ways. First, you can touch its screen to easily move from song to song, through playlists. Second, you will still have nice design physical buttons to give you the best user experience from both worlds. 
 
 Drag & Drop Music Management with Expandable Storage

Easily manage your music files by dragging them from your computer's hard drive onto, and is expandable via an SDXC port, which supports up to 2 additional terabytes.

A Large, Serviceable Battery
 One the biggest complaints against many portable music players is that they don't have a replaceable battery. When the battery dies, the whole device dies with it, forcing users to pay for repair.
Geek Wave's battery is user-accessible. After the expected two year lifespan of the rechargeable lithium ion battery, you can easily swap in a new one.
Instant Power Technology Geek Wave analog output stage holds power in reserve for sonic events that have more ""boom."" It doubles the power of the amplifier when it's needed.
 
 
Our Powerful Duet Engine
 Our company has been developing the most cutting-edge ways to enhance audio from MP3's, CD's, and other low-resolution streams since 2010. In our $31,000 Da Vinci Dual DAC, we have a sophisticated technology called Duet Engine, which is a timing technology that effectively doubles the quality of a music file without artificial ""up-sampling"" by merging two wave patterns of sound. No gaps, no air, just pure audio. Duet Engine dramatically improves audio quality, making the experience more lifelike.
 
 
 
A Three-layer Elastic Buffer
In digital signal conversion, timing is everything! To ensure computer speed fluctuations won't influence Geek Wave, we're adding the same proprietary (and patent-pending) three-layer buffer we developed for Da Vinci DAC to Geek Wave.

Features vs other competitors

We got really quite some requests from Geek Force hope we could put Geek Wave against the state-of-the-art digital audio players currently on the market. I agree with you, during past few months, we see few respectable competitors have launched good products there.  All we want is to have a clean chart for our backers to know where we are.

<p>My name is <b>Liam Kyle Cahill</b> and I'm a nationally touring Folk-Rock solo act who tours so much I might as well be based out of my Subaru Outback. <br/></p>
<p>In 2015 I played 188 shows in 17 states while traveling over 47,000 miles and I am on track to do the same in 2016. During this time on the road, I have written a new collection of songs that are my most diverse and mature songs to date...but I need YOUR HELP to get these new songs recorded! <br/></p>
<p>Please consider pre-ordering and/or sponsoring me on my journey. In return I will share with you my brand new 4-song EP <i><b>Four Leaf Clover</b></i> for immediate download (otherwise available June 2016) IN ADDITION to you receiving my brand new 10-12 song full-length album <i><b>Love &amp; Loss</b></i> once it is completed in the summer 2017.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Why do you need money? Isn't music free?!<br/>
</h3> <p>This may sound crazy, but there is no such thing as a free lunch or free music. Every amazing album you have ever listened to costs thousands of dollars from the time of inception to the time it reaches your ears. <br/></p>
<p>Three years ago you helped me raise $10,000 to record <i>The Key To Happiness</i>, and I couldn't have done it without you. At that time I was still working full time as an exploration geologist, and have since quit my job and given up everything to pursue my personal legend and achieve my dreams of ""making it"" as a professional musician. But now more than ever, I need the support of every person who also believes that I can do this.</p>
<p>Here is a quick breakdown of what the base goal of $10,000 will be going towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying my producer/engineer and studio musicians</li>
<li>Paying for the time spent in the recording studio<br/>
</li>
<li>Paying for the album to be professionally mixed and mastered 
(i.e. making sure it sounds as good as the songs you hear on the radio)</li>
<li>Paying for the album cover art and design</li>
<li>Paying for the physical CDs and vinyl to be printed and packaged</li>
<li>Paying for the album to be distributed digitally all over the world</li>

<h3>What if you raise more than your goal? Does the rest just go to beer?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Not even close. The base goal of $10,000 is the <i>minimum</i> amount necessary to produce a high quality, full-length album. To put it in perspective, I spent more than double that to record <i>The Key To Happiness</i>...but after nearly two years of non-stop touring on a musicians budget I know what it takes to make a dollar go as far as possible. <br/></p>
<p>Every penny that comes into this campaign will be mindfully spent on the making and/or the promotion of <i><b>Love &amp; Loss</b></i>. Any money above and beyond the base goal will help cover additional things like music videos, new merch, submitting the album for national and international reviews, and of course more touring.  <br/></p>
<p>Music is not just a hobby for me...music is my job, my business, my

<p>Hey everybody, and thanks for stopping by! We are the J-MUSIC Ensemble, a band dedicated to bringing new perspectives to Japanese music. As jazz musicians, we play jazz versions of J-Pop, anime, and video game songs, in an effort to get an even deeper understanding of the culture that inspired us so much and give back to it at the same time. Our most recent venture sees us exploring the music of one of the most important games in recent history: the revolutionary role-playing game, Persona 5. We fell in love with this music as well as other fans of the series did, and when it came time to thinking about what our second full studio album would be, choosing to play the music of Persona 5 was a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Because getting into a professional studio in New York City was out of our budget, we resorted to renting out a rehearsal space instead. This way, we could at least make videos and some amateur recordings to show our fans what we're working on. However, these ""Persona 5 Jam Sessions"", as we called them, grew to be some of our most popular videos on our YouTube channel, and this unexpected attention let us know that we should start taking this seriously. Within a year and a half of us uploading our ""Persona 5 Jam Sessions"", we were getting hundreds of really inspiring and heartfelt responses letting us know how much of a difference we made in their lives. The fact that there was a worldwide audience of people willing to express themselves and connect with each other through something so niche as Persona 5 and jazz really impacted us. We always wanted our music to bring people together, and we could not have made it this far without the overwhelming support from these fans that listened to, liked, and shared our covers so much. This is when the idea for making a new album, a tribute to our J-MUSIC community, was conceived.</p>
<p>Of course, because we haven't had the resources to record in a professional recording studio since 2015, making this album would be our greatest challenge yet. We have big ambitions for this project, and in order to turn this idea into a reality, we're going to need your help.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Due to the nature of our project, our funding goal is pretty high. That's because of not only the production of CDs and digital distribution, but also mastering costs, artwork (by our amazing artist, blazpu), cover song licensing, and special new items like limited-edition vinyls, t-shirts, posters, and more! Here's just the most essential parts of what our price breakdown looks like:</p>
</div>

<p>This doesn't include aforementioned costs like artwork, digital distribution, and perks we would give you all for helping us out, such as t-shirts, stickers, posters, and future items we'd love to make. Due to the overwhelming cost of making physical merchandise, we don't plan on making vinyl records or CDs available after this fundraiser. However, the more we raise here, the more of this merchandise can be made!</p>

<p>As you all know by now, most of our hopes and wishes for the 2020 year have been either delayed or completely eradicated by the new COVID-19 epidemic. Our hearts go out to everyone and their families who have been affected by this terrible, historic tragedy. While the band has been fortunate enough to not have come into direct contact with the virus so far, we can't say the same thing for our careers.</p>
<p>Starting in the fall 2019 season, we set out to record this album and made plans for a mid-2020 release date, no later than May 2020. However, this goal soon became difficult to maintain, because by the time the virus had made its first major growth escalation, the world began to take serious measures to stop it from spreading. This meant, of course, shutting down all non-essential work, travel, and social gatherings for a period of time until everything could get under control. Not only that, but reopening parts of the world - especially New York City, where we live - would take time, as well. What did this mean for us as artists? This means that musicians were essentially the first to go, and we are most likely the last job to come back. Our main source of income, and connecting with others, is now all but gone. Some of us have not even been approved for unemployment. It is a very dark time for everyone.</p>
<p>It's very unfortunate that our occupation, being professional artists, would not be seen as ""essential work"", considering that we are the one group of people everyone is now turning to for entertainment, comfort, and clarity during our time of isolation. We've put the entirety of our collective energy into this album, and we want to continue to make people happy with our music. Without the help of the community, this project will become more than just delayed. Let's make this one count!</p>
<p>--</p>
</div><div>
<p>That's about it, for now! We appreciate every bit that you all contribute to us very much. We're not just talking about funding, either. We understand that the world's current situation is hitting everyone hard right now, so if you still would like to help, the best thing you could do is to tell your friends about what we're doing! If you're a Persona fan, jazz fan, or just an all-around lover of good music, you can help us out massively by sharing this campaign with people you know. The more people that get involved, the closer we can get to realizing this collective dream!</p>
<p>Thank you so much, everybody. We can't express enough how much it means to all of us that we're even able to realistically dream of something like this! It's all because of you. We'll see you on the other side!</p>
<p>========================================================</p>
<p>皆さん、こんにちは！この度は私たちのプロジェクトをチェックしてくれてありがとうございます！私たちは日本の音楽に新たな光を当てることを目的としたバンド、J-MUSIC Ensemble（アンサンブル）です。私たちに多大な影響を与えた日本の文化への理解を深めつつ、その愛する文化へ還元できる方法を模索することを目的に、本業のジャズミュージシャンとしての演奏力を活かして、J-POP、アニソン、ゲーム音楽などのジャズカバーをしています。</p>
<p>私たちの最新のプロジェクトでは、近年のゲーム史において最も重要なサントラを誇る革命的RPG作品『ペルソナ５』を探求しています。多くのペルソナ・シリーズのファン同様に、私たちもこのサントラに恋をしてしまいました。私たちが2ndアルバムの構想を練っている時に、ペルソナ５の楽曲を選んだのは必然だったと言えるでしょう。</p>
<p>私たちの現在の予算では、ニューヨーク・シティでプロのスタジオを借りることは難しいため、リハーサル・スペースなどを代用してきました。自前の機材を利用して動画を投稿することで、少なくとも、ファンに僕たちの目指しているものを見せることは出来ました。それにも関わらず、『ペルソナ５ ジャム・セッション』は私たちのYouTubeチャンネルでも最も人気を誇るシリーズとなり、この楽曲たちにより本気で取り組んでみたいと思うようになりました。</p>
<p>『ペルソナ５　ジャム・セッション』シリーズの投稿から１年半のうちに、私たちは心のこもったコメントを非常に沢山いただきました。このファンからの反響こそが、このシリーズが人々にどれだけ影響を与えたかを気付かせてくれたのです。『ペルソナ５とジャズ』というニッチなジャンルを通して、世界中のオーディエンスと繋がることが出来たという事実は、私たちに非常に大きな衝撃を与えてくれました。</p>
<p>私たちは音楽を通して、人々の心を結びつけたいと思ってきました。そして私たちがここまで来れたのも、私たちの音楽を聴いて、イイネやシェアをしてくれた人たちの多大なサポートのおかげだと思っています。そんな時に、J-MUSICのコミュニティにトリビュートを捧げる、ニュー・アルバムのアイデアが生まれたのです。</p>
<p>私たちは2015年以来、プロのレコーディング・スタジオに入って音源を制作する余裕がなかったため、今回のアルバム制作はこれまでで最大のチャレンジとなります。私たちは野心を持ってこのプロジェクトに取り組みんでいます。そして、このアイデアを現実のものとするためには、皆さんの力が必要なのです。</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>私たちのプロジェクトの性質上、目標金額はかなり高く設定されています。これは、CDのプレスやデジタル配信の他にも、マスタリング費用、アートワーク（絵師のblazpuが手掛けています）、カバー曲のライセンス費用、そして新商品の限定版アナログレコード、Tシャツ、ポスター等の製作に費用が掛かるからです。本プロジェクトの予算の大まかな内訳は以下のようになります：</p> <p>CD製作費用：$1,000 （¥100,000*）</p>
<p>アナログレコード製作費用：$4,900（¥490,000*）</p>
<p>マスタリング費用：$2,000（¥200,000*）</p>
<p>カバー曲のライセンス費用：$1,600（¥160,000*）</p> <p>* $1＝¥100換算で計算した場合</p>
<p>以上の内訳には、アートワーク、デジタル配信費用や、Tシャツ、ステッカー、ポスター等々の支援者特典は含まれていません。支援者特典は今後もさらに追加される予定です。また、フィジカルの商品には多大なコストが掛かるため、本クラウドファンディングの終了後には、CDやアナログレコードの生産予定はありません。しかし、このプロジェクトで支援が集まれば集まるほど、多くの商品を準備することが出来ます！</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>アルバムのトラック・リストもついに決定しました！</p>
<p>以下の楽曲が収録される予定です：</p>
<ul>
<li>Life Will Change (feat. Mohmega)</li>
<li>Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There (feat. Sapphire)</li>
<li>Last Surprise (feat. Karlea Lynné and Ruby Choi)</li>
<li>Tokyo Emergency</li>
<li>王と王妃と奴隷</li>
<li>What's Going On</li>
<li>Butterfly Kiss</li>
<li>A Woman</li>
<li>Price (feat. Norman Edwards)</li>
<li>Life Goes On (feat. Adam Neely)</li>
<li>母のいた日々</li>

<p>皆さんもご存知の通り、COVID-19の大流行の影響により、私たちの2020年の前途は後ろ倒しになったり、立ち消えてしまうことになりました。この歴史的な悲劇によって影響を受けた皆さんとそのご家族には、心から同情申し上げます。私たちのバンドは幸いにも、現時点ではウイルスによる影響を受けておりませんが、私たちのキャリアの方は多大なダメージを受けています。</p>
<p>本アルバムの制作は2019年にスタートを切り、遅くとも2020年の５月にはリリースがされる予定でした。しかしながら、前述のウイルスの第一波の影響により、世界中が本格的なウイルス蔓延の阻止に動き始めまたのです。これはつまり、非エッセンシャル・ワーク*、旅行、そしてイベントなどの開催が一旦は全てシャットダウンされてしまったということです。それだけでなく、一部の都市が完全に元に戻るまでには、時間が掛かることが予想されます。特に私たちの住むニューヨークは、完全再開までに非常に時間が掛かるでしょう。</p>
<p>*エッセンシャル・ワーク - 社会を支える必要不可欠な仕事のこと。例：医師や看護師、スーパーのレジ係、公共交通機関の職員など。</p>
<p>これは私たちのようなアーティストにとっては、どういった影響を与えるのか？ミュージシャンのような職業は真っ先に仕事を失い、復職するのが最も遅くなる職種だと言えるでしょう。私たちの主な収入源や、人々との繋がりは儚くも全て失われてしまいました。私たちの中には、失業手当を受け取れない人たちもいます。私たちは氷河期を迎えているのです。</p>
<p>私たちの職業である「プロ音楽家」が”エッセンシャル・ワーク”として認められないことは非常に残念なことです。この隔離の時にエンターテイメントが今まで以上に注目されていて、それを提供している裏側には私たちのような人間がいることを考えると、なおさらです。バンド全体が本アルバムに全精力を捧げており、私たちの音楽を通して皆さんに喜びを届けたいと思っています。皆さんの力が無ければ、このプロジェクトは遅延するどころか、存在自体が危うくなってしまうでしょう。どうかご支援をお願いします！</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>私たちからのメッセージは以上です！皆さんの支援には大小に関わらず、全て感謝しています。もちろん、それは金銭的な支援だけに限りません。現在世界を取り巻く状況は、等しく皆さんに影響を与えていることも重々承知しています。もしそれでも支援したいという方は、ぜひお友達に私たちのプロジェクトについて教えてあげて下さい！もしあなたがペルソナのファン、ジャズのファン、もしくはグッド・ミュージックの愛好家であれば、このプロジェクトをシェアしていただけるだけで大きな支援になります。より多くの人を巻き込めれば、この夢の現実に一歩近付けるのですから！</p>
<p>最後まで読んでいただき、本当にありがとうございます。そもそもこんな夢のようなプロジェクトを立ち上げられたことが、私たちにとってはとても意味のあることなのです！全ては皆さんのおかげです。ぜひこのプロジェクトを実現せましょう！</p>

支援プランと特典一覧の日本語訳はこちらから。
Hey everybody, and thanks for stopping by! We are the J-MUSIC Ensemble, a band dedicated to bringing new perspectives to Japanese music. As jazz musicians, we play jazz versions of J-Pop, anime, and video game songs, in an effort to get an even deeper understanding of the culture that inspired us so much and give back to it at the same time. Our most recent venture sees us exploring the music of one of the most important games in recent history: the revolutionary role-playing game, Persona 5. We fell in love with this music as well as other fans of the series did, and when it came time to thinking about what our second full studio album would be, choosing to play the music of Persona 5 was a no-brainer.
Because getting into a professional studio in New York City was out of our budget, we resorted to renting out a rehearsal space instead. This way, we could at least make videos and some amateur recordings to show our fans what we're working on. However, these ""Persona 5 Jam Sessions"", as we called them, grew to be some of our most popular videos on our YouTube channel, and this unexpected attention let us know that we should start taking this seriously. Within a year and a half of us uploading our ""Persona 5 Jam Sessions"", we were getting hundreds of really inspiring and heartfelt responses letting us know how much of a difference we made in their lives. The fact that there was a worldwide audience of people willing to express themselves and connect with each other through something so niche as Persona 5 and jazz really impacted us. We always wanted our music to bring people together, and we could not have made it this far without the overwhelming support from these fans that listened to, liked, and shared our covers so much. This is when the idea for making a new album, a tribute to our J-MUSIC community, was conceived.
Of course, because we haven't had the resources to record in a professional recording studio since 2015, making this album would be our greatest challenge yet. We have big ambitions for this project, and in order to turn this idea into a reality, we're going to need your help.


 
Due to the nature of our project, our funding goal is pretty high. That's because of not only the production of CDs and digital distribution, but also mastering costs, artwork (by our amazing artist, blazpu), cover song licensing, and special new items like limited-edition vinyls, t-shirts, posters, and more! Here's just the most essential parts of what our price breakdown looks like:



CD production: $1,000

Vinyl production: $4,900

Mastering: $2,000

Cover Song licensing: $1,600


This doesn't include aforementioned costs like artwork, digital distribution, and perks we would give you all for helping us out, such as t-shirts, stickers, posters, and future items we'd love to make. Due to the overwhelming cost of making physical merchandise, we don't plan on making vinyl records or CDs available after this fundraiser. However, the more we raise here, the more of this merchandise can be made!
It is also our pleasure to finally announce the track list for the album! You can expect to see:

Life Will Change (feat. Mohmega)
Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There (feat. Sapphire)
Last Surprise (feat. Karlea Lynné and Ruby Choi)
Tokyo Emergency
King, Queen, and Slave
What's Going On
Butterfly Kiss
A Woman
Price (feat. Norman Edwards)
Life Goes On (feat. Adam Neely)
The Days When My Mother Was There
Layer Cake
Beneath The Mask (feat. Ruby Choi)

We are Wynona Bleach, an alternative rock band from Belfast, Northern Ireland. We have been recording, touring and making noises together for 2 years, and previous to that a further 3 under our former name of R51. Basically:We supported Alice in Chains in 2019 on the Irish leg of their world tour, while promoting our debut EP ""Sugar"" in 2019 (on limited edition green vinyl). Right after a summer of UK/IRL shows we hauled a whole recording studio from Belfast to an abandoned warehouse in central Portugal in September 2019, where we built a studio out of anything we could beg & borrow to record our debut record with Bill Ryder-Jones! Installing the desk into the old cantina/kitchen of the (now abandoned) pool table factory The Factory was a closed down facility built to manufacture billiard tables. The band has a close friend who owns a house near it, and when joking with the idea of us going to the house and writing/recording an album, he asked his neighbour did he mind about the noise. His neighbour said ""why not use my empty factory?"" So we did. We love you Dave + Joanne & Jeronimo + The Batista Family.Mike Hanvey (our live sound guy) drove everything down from Belfast (over 1700 miles each way!). We took artist and photographer Audrey Gillespie to shoot photos on 35mm film, Ethan Owens to look after guitars and backline and Matty filmed a documentary of the entire process!We basically used the offices and outbuildings as a live room and control room, with bizarre spaces like weird sheds and chicken coops as reverb chambers, guitar speaker cab rooms and vocal booths. We used old Pool Tables as sound reflection panels and old insulation to block up windows!To get it off the ground, we had some financial help with travel from Help Musicians and The NI Arts council, but that only made a small dent in the whole project's travel etc, which the rest we had up until now self-funded from our live shows and merch sales. Now that its almost ready to release (and that the rest of our shows for the year are cancelled due to the lockdown!) we are relying on offering up some pre-orders to help us get the world to hear!! First session with Bill Ryder-Jones, sessions which spanned around 10 long, dizzying days. Another 14 with our Live sound guy Mike Hanvey, after Bill headed home to tour the UK/EUR. We tracked the album across around 3 weeks. Due to sooo many factors, some final vocal sessions were delayed and were completed back home in Belfast. (with some stuff being finished at home even right up as far as lockdown in isolation from each other! more on that story TBA!) But the important thing is we made it home alive and the tracks sound WICKED. The record is currently being mixed by a couple of GREAT and amazing human beings (to be announced shortly), and its finally time to get the last push we need to complete it!Multiple test packs occurred to make a whole studio fit in a regular van, that was illegally overweight over 1700 miles to Rural Portugal We need your help with: - Funds to actually press the record and merch, - Funds to cover the PR campaign we have planned to help us get it into peoples ears, - Cover final remaining Mixing and Mastering costs. Matty, Bill, Mike and Carl nearing completion of the record. We had found an old freezer that still worked (left of picture) which became a place to crawl into after immensely sweaty tracking sessions.  The Impact you will make on a pre-order or donation:Like almost everyone in the music industry, the Coronavirus pandemic caused us to all lose our only source of income (music) and put the brakes on all of our planned mix sessions to complete the record. This constant pushing back of our hopeful release date has really taken its toll on our brains.So, any funds we hoped to receive from booked live shows around the UK along with the merchandise sales at these shows have now gone, and any funds we have left have had to be used to keep us afloat during this time with absolutely no income :( Aaron pictured from inside an old office window at the factory. Originally going to be a vocal booth, we jammed it full of insulation we found to help deaden the main room instead. Right now, we have 12 tracks for the record and 10 are completely done and being mixed. 2 just need some vocals tracked (which we are doing at home in isolation!!)We have a handful of overdubs and things to tweak while being mixed, but due to not being able to be together we are overcoming it by recording these at home!

There were multiple  iterations of this room through the first week of setup before Bill Ryder-Jones arrived to begin tracking. Other Ways You Can HelpWe totally know that given the lockdown, spare cash to donate or pre-order is a massive ask, so all we can hope is if you can't donate, that you might be able to share our campaign, and stream and share the album when it comes out, please help us tell the world about this mammoth creative undertaking we embarked on!! iThe end of tracking at the end of September 2019.

<h3>The Song</h3>
<p><b><i>Do you have a devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus?   </i></b>I do!  And I want to share it with the world through my song, <i>Sacred Heart is the Boat</i>.  </p>
<p>This world is in complete chaos with God having been all but forgotten by our mainstream culture.   But right here, right now, you and I can work together to spread the messages of love and mercy found in devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.   Here's the deal:</p>
<p>My original song, <i>Sacred Heart is the Boat</i> is nearly finished at the recording studio!   But I need to raise a little more money to get this incredibly important song finished and released.  </p>
<h3><i><strong>Sacred Heart is the Boat</strong> is about the Sacred Heart of Jesus</i></h3>

<p><i>Sacred Heart is the boat </i>is my attempt to explain how God's love is like an endless ocean.  The Sacred Heart of Jesus is the boat that can carry us to God's love and to eternal life.  My hope with this song is to introduce new listeners to the Sacred Heart of Jesus while encouraging a deeper devotion to the Sacred Heart in others. </p>

<p><strong>For anyone who doesn't know, here is how professional working works</strong>: First we lay down the raw guitar track using a metronome (also called a scratch track).  Second we record drums and bass guitar.  Next we record higher quality guitar erasing the scratch track.   Then we record vocals.  Next we add additional elements such as keyboards, piano, harp or other instruments.  From there we record backing vocals, any additional percussion or other instruments and we begin to mix down the tracks.  After that we mix, review, edit, mix, review, edit until we produce the final mix!  </p>
<p>I personally perform the guitar, vocals and sometimes the percussion, bass and keys.  But I also bring in professional studio musicians to record instruments such as drums, bass, strings and backing vocals to create my mastered music.</p>
<p><strong>Here is where we are right now in the production of <i>Sacred Heart is the Boat</i></strong>.  We have recorded the drums, bass, guitar and main vocals.  Plus we've added in some cool keyboards.  But we still need to add in backing vocals and potentially more guitar and strings.   Last we need to mix, edit and review until we produce the final mix.  We need around 10 hours of additional studio time along with a few additional session musicians to finish the track.  From there we will master the final mix for release! </p>
<p>I am not writing, producing and spending countless hours reviewing my music to create mediocre songs.  For music to have a big impact it needs to be amazing, high quality and it must entertain while also being inspirational.  That's a tall order! </p>

<h3>Help me finish <i>Sacred Heart is the Boat</i> &amp; you will receive the following perks:</h3>

<li>We need roughly $1,500 to book studio time, pay musicians, mix, edit, review and master Sacred Heart is the Boat.  </li>

<h2><strong>Rock’n’Roll to Free the Soul</strong></h2>
<p>Now more than ever, our world needs music that highlights the joy, pain and beauty of what it means to be human in this time of cultural transformation and spiritual neglect.</p>
<p>We’re in the middle of a pandemic and I am feeling it like everybody else. Tours and regular shows are cancelled, including my tour in India at the end of this year.</p>
<p>But Rock’n’Roll never dies, also not during a pandemic, now more than ever do we need new creative work from artists to uplift our souls and transport us back to a time when music was the universal language that brought everyone together.</p>
<p>In these current times, we need to find a way for emotional growth and spiritual comfort.</p>
<p>We need to seek enjoyment and find sense in all of what 2020 has thrown at us and we need to learn that the human experience is a shared experience.</p>
<p>So, I decided to record a 4 song EP with some amazing artists here in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The EP will be a creation that reflects the social and emotional landscape of our historically unprecedented era. It will incorporate elements of the 70’s while combining them with a modern rock feel.</p>
<p>It will be produced at some amazing Hollywood studios and we have already made a start.</p>
<p>The songs have been carefully chosen, 2 are covers from a famous British Rock band, but with a twist that will excite you, and 2 songs are my own compositions that will fit into the song style I chose to record.</p>
<p>I am grateful for any contribution. Big or small, it will help to contribute to my costs for studio, mastering and musician, and I will be proud of all the people who dedicate their names to this record (EP), especially those who make an executive producer contribution.</p>
<p>To learn how to get involved please see below and read which method best suits you and how you would like to be a part of this historical music project.</p>
<p>Thanking you in advance for helping me to keep Rock’n’roll alive!</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>My name is Amanda Standalone and I am an Americana musician from Minnesota. I am an award winning singer, songwriter, multi instrumentalist and performer. I have been working at my craft ever since I can remember and have performed all over the United States, on stages and street corners. I hold a BA in music with an emphasis in strings, and all I want in the world is to make music my only job. I need your help!</div>
<div>I recently received a small grant from the Lakes Region Arts Council and the Mcknight Foundation to record a solo album of my original material, all written in my younger years while I was traveling and performing across the states. With the help of my dear friends at the Abandoned Scout Camp in Hewitt, MN, we have completed the recording, but now its production time, and I need your help!</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Here's where your contributions will be headed:</p>

<h3><u><strong>Wer wir sind:</strong></u></h3>
<p>Wir sind Delta Constellations aus Göttingen. Anfang 2020 haben wir uns zusammengefunden und haben angefangen Lions Texte und Ideen in einen Bandkontext zu übersetzen. Mit Aaron an der Leadgitarre, Jonas am Bass und Carsten am Schlagzeug haben wir uns seitdem ein komfortables Repertoir an eigenen Songs aufgebaut. Zehn davon würden wir nun gerne professionell produziert in einem Album verewigen.</p>
<h3><u><strong>Warum Crowdfunding?</strong></u></h3>
<p>Diese Kampagne unterstützt direkt - und ausschließlich - unser Album Projekt <strong>Recoveries</strong>. Über die letzten eineinhalb Jahre haben wir ohne Auftrittsmöglichkeiten und Gage keine Möglichkeit gehabt uns die hinreichenden Mittel anzusparen. Dennoch sind wir momentan an einem Punkt, an dem wir bereit sind mit dem Material ins Studio zu gehen. Ein unsicherer Ausblick in die Zukunft sorgt auch dafür, dass wir nicht mehr warten wollen. Nun sind wir aber auf eure Hilfe angewiesen.</p>
<h3><strong><u>Was eure Unterstützung für uns bedeutet:</u></strong></h3>
<p>Eure Unterstützung nimmt uns den Stress jeden Tag darüber nachzudenken wie wir das Album finanzieren können. Jeder Beitrag - auch jede kleine Spende ohne ein Perk zu erwerben - bringt uns näher an unser Ziel unsere Musik in eure Ohren zu kriegen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong><u>Was wir brauchen &amp; Was ihr bekommt</u></strong></h3>
<p>Die finanzielle Planung eines Albums hängt in unserer Situation von einigen Variablen ab, die wir nur grob einschätzen können. Deswegen haben wir uns für ein Kampagnen-Ziel entschieden, bei dem wir uns sicher sind, uns voll auf die kreative Gestaltung des Albums konzentrieren können, sofern dieses Ziel erreicht wird.</p>
<p>Bis ihr das fertige Album und alle weiteren Perks genießen könnt, kommen diverse Kosten auf uns zu. Dazu gehören Produzent, Studiozeit und Mastering, aber auch Versand und Produktionskosten der<strong> CDs</strong>, der <strong>Sticker</strong> und der <strong>Poster</strong>.</p>
<p>Ganz exklusiv für diese Kampagne sind die <strong>handgeschriebenen Songtexte</strong>. Für 20 glückliche Unterstützer:innen gibt sich Lion sehr viel Mühe jeweils einen Song seiner Wahl niederzuschreiben. Da dieses Perk limitiert ist kann es nicht als Add-On erworben werden, wenn ihr schon ein anderes Perk ausgewählt habt. Wählt also zuerst den Songtext aus, von da aus könnt ihr dann eine CD, ein Sticker-Paket und ein Poster hinzufügen.</p>
<p>Über die haptischen Perks hinaus bieten wir ab sofort <strong>Wohnzimmerkonzerte</strong> an, bei denen ihr die Möglichkeit habt uns innerhalb Deutschlands zu euch zu holen, um einen Abend mit guter Laune und stimmungsvoller Musik zu genießen!</p>
<p>Ebenso gibt es den <strong>Absurdteuren Grillabend</strong>. Wenn ihr zu viel Geld habt und uns einen unglaublichen Gefallen tun wollt, machen wir einen Ort fest und bringen alles mit für einen perfekten Grillabend.</p>
<p>Sollte das Kampagnen-Ziel nicht erreicht werden legen wir trotzdem alles daran das Album produzieren zu lassen. Je nach Situation müssten wir dann privat finanzielle Anteile übernehmen - <i>was wir aber gerne vermeiden möchten</i>.<br/>Wir sind sehr motiviert um dieses Album zu verwirklichen!</p>

<h3><u><strong>Who we are:</strong></u></h3>
<p>We are Delta Constellations from Göttingen. At the beginning of 2020 we found each other to start converting Lion's songtexts and ideas into a band context. With Aaron on the lead guitar, Jonas on the bass and Carsten on the drums, We have accumulated a very sizeable repertoire of songs,ten of which we now want to professionally immortalize in the form of our first studio album</p>
<h3><u><strong>Why Crowdfunding?</strong></u></h3>
<p>This campaign directly - and only - supports our album recording project 'Recoveries'. Over the last one and a half years, without gigs and opportunities to earn money as musicians, we were not able to save the needed dough for a project like this. Nonetheless, we find ourselves at a point in time, where we are ready to hit the studio. A not secure outlook on the future is one more reason for us not to wait any longer. Now we need your help!</p>
<h3><strong><u>What your contribution means for us:</u></strong></h3>
<p>Your contribution saves us the headache of thinking all day and every day about how to finance this project. Every Euro - even the smallest donation without getting any perks - brings us one step closer to bringing our music into your ears.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong><u>What we need &amp; What you get</u></strong></h3>
<p>In our situation, financial planning for an album is tied to some variables, that we can hardly predict. This is why we have decided on a campaign goal, where we are sure of being able to fully concentrate on the creative work on the album, as long as the goal is met.</p>
<p>Until you can enjoy the album and all the other perks, there are several costs awaiting us. Included in that are the producer, studio time, mixing and mastering, but also the shipping and production costs for the <strong>CDs</strong>, the <strong>stickers</strong> and the <strong>posters.</strong></p>
<p>Exclusive to this campaign, you can get <strong>handwritten songtexts</strong>. For 20 lucky people, Lion is making an effort to individualize a song of his choice and writing the text down for you. Because this perk is limited, you can't purchase it as an Add-On. If you want to get it, you have to select it first and then add on a CD, sticker package or poster, if you want.</p>
<p>In addition to the tangible perks, we are now offering <strong>living-room-concerts</strong>, where you have the opportunity to bring us to your home within Germany to enjoy an evening with us, good music and a great atmosphere!</p>
<p>There is also the <strong>absurdly expensive barbecue evening</strong>. If you have too much money and want to do us an incredible favor, we'll fix a place and bring everything with us for a perfect barbecue evening.</p>
<p>In case the campaign goal will not be achieved, we will still do everything we can to produce the album. Depending on the situation, we would need to take over financial shares privately - <i>which we would like to avoid</i>.<br/>We are very motivated to bring this album to life!</p>

I just listened to the final versions all the way through and I am happy to say this is the most proud I've ever felt about any creative project I've touched. I am elated and can't wait to share it with you!
Working with JonJon, my producer, has been a glorious collaborative experience. I never dreamed that the recordings and arrangements could sound like this. Thanks to him I get to have a total ""hell-yeah"" feeling about baring my soul via this music.

Update
I'm so elated that this campaign is now over 100% funded!  Anything raised over the $6,000 goal will go toward the following parts of the project:


- Hiring a special Visionary Artist (TBC) to create absolutely magical cover art that I've been dreaming about since I wrote ""Rainbow Light.""- Doing a photo shoot with the fabulous Robin Clark (so I don't need to use bad phone selfies or 3 year old photos) for live show flyers, reviews, interviews and other press coverage this album may receive. - Paying the guest musicians for their time, energy, gas and tolls (I'm so thrilled to be able to do this).


Your contribution will be well utilized and highly valued! Thank you so much for your support.


The Music I'm finally recording my album!
For years, people have been asking me where they can find recordings of my music. Up until now I've had to simply say, ""soon."" 
Now I'm teaming up with producer John Alezivakis at Little Buddha Studios in San Rafael, California to create my first full length album. He has worked with many artists in the same genre including Tina Malia and Shimshai.  I'll be recording 9 original songs (and re-recording the ones on the EP) in a beautiful, simple acoustic style that allows their healing power to shine through.



I would love your support so that I can finally offer my musical medicine to all who may benefit from receiving it!
If you're not familiar with my music, I write original sacred songs that are prayers for deep healing and transformation. People often share with me that long after hearing them, my songs spontaneously reappear in their consciousness in moments of challenge and celebration. The lyrics contain mantras that slip into their subconscious over time, gradually replacing ruminating thoughts and unproductive worries with powerful prayers.  You can listen to a couple of them in the video above.
If you are familiar with my music, this is the track listing (subject to change during the creative process, of course!) 



1. Gateless Gate
2. Rainbow Light
3. Cuatro Colores
4. I See Your Wings
5. Divine Alignment 
6. Ember
7. Surrender 
8. Broken Open
9. Open Up Your Heart
What I Need & What You Get

It takes so much time and energy to make a great album! I had no idea what truly went into the process before I recorded my 3 song EP.


I am raising money to cover the main expenses, which are the studio time, the producer and the post production. 

If this campaign is successfully funded, I'll be able to spend the ideal amount of time in the studio to record and capture the vision I have for this album.

I've created some beautiful and unique perks here for you to make sure that you're handsomely rewarded for your contribution!

ALBUM BE THY NAME - Album Information

Title: HubrisRelease Date: October 22nd 2021Tracklist:

Carnage in Carthage
Astral Elixir
Son of Storms
Die 1,000 Deaths (ft. Heinrich Yoshio from 'Aether Realm')

AIN'T TALKIN' 'BOUT FUNDS - What We Need 
Here is the price breakdown of the new album (all prices in $CAD)


Recording - $0
Seriously - we did all the recording ourselves by taking our downtime during COVID-19 to upskill, buy good gear, and spent THOUSANDS of hours together demoing, re-writing, and finalizing the tracks and we are charging NOTHING to our fans for that time - this will not be factored into our costs. 


Guest artists - $760
We actually pay our guest artists for their feature spots as we don't believe in the ""Hey bro want to be on an album for free?"" bullshit that seems to permeate our industry.


Editing, Mixing & Mastering - $10,389.79
This was our attempt at getting as professional-sounding of an album as possible with a world-class producer.


Design - $1042.50
This covers artwork, design services, and photography


Printing - $1300
This is only covering the cost of printing and shipping 


Press & Advertising - $7522.84
Press kits, media mailouts, Facebook ads, Instagram ads, Spotify ads, you name it... this is the wonderful world we live in where your album goes unnoticed unless you pay our overlords to allow others to see it. 



Music Videos - $3060.64 
This is only covering the costs of our lyric videos pre-album launch - all music videos set for post-album launch are not factored in. 


Indiegogo Fees - $1924.23
Yes, they take 5% of whatever we raise.


TOTAL - $26,000

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We hope that this album inspires people to live their best lives. We hope it brings joy. We hope it makes you smile. We hope it evokes awe, and wonder, and amazement. These are some of the things we feel when we play and we hope that comes through in the music.<br/><br/>When you invest in us you encourage us to dream even bigger. We become more confident and better able to reach more people. Your collaboration helps us create our music and spread our message further.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The process of recording this album has had many ups and downs. We've had resources given to us, and also pulled away. We've had people come on in and out of the project. We've had good laughs and good cries. But we made it. On July 15 we begin releasing this long awaited project. It's been 18 months of realizing the collective dream we shared.<br/><br/>At this point the biggest challenges feel like they are behind us, ahead of us lies the task of getting this music heard. It would be great to have all the love and effort we poured into this album validated by having it actually reach people. A marketing budget would help us spread the message far and wide.<br/> </p>
<h3>Meet the Team</h3>
</div><div>
<p>​Ashley Gilmore is the singer. Her voice will make you quiver. There is an undeniable power that her voice carries - it is sincere, and raw, but so rich and expressive. Her response seems super-natural. Music is her first language. With cat like reflexes she harmonizes and crafts melodies that steal your heart and leave you speechless. She is irresistible, like an eternally burning fire. <br/><br/>Daniel Salij is the bass player. He is solid, constant, and allowing - gentle yet firm. Creating a space/foundation on which the others can explore and create. He is the Earth. A vast stunning landscape, unshakable and enduring.<br/><br/>Jacob Blanchard is the guitar player. A master of audio atmospheres and textures. Using multiple layers of reverb, delays and other effects, he paints universes you can taste with your ears. At times his playing is spacious and ethereal, and at times funky and articulate. His style is undeniable. Transcendental and experimental. Jacob is the sky and ocean - explosive bursts of light in the deep and dark. <br/><br/>Dylan Piercey is the drummer. A perfectly fitting glove, or cinderella's glass slipper. He is a solid, pocket post-experimental player whose skill and expertise glues the Elemaria project together.  He is music's expression of rocket science. He is dynamic - a pebble and a mountain. The sands of constant time and natural momentum. He is a tempo conductor, pointing to forever.<br/><br/>Beyond the band listed above, the album includes extensive contributions from: the magical and breathtaking Matthew Bajcar (keyboards on 5 of 7 songs), from  Luis Valiente on Into the Light (mixing and keyboards), Zarah Aedma (back up vocals on Prayer and Always), Ashton Price (mixing 5 of 7 songs), and Jeremy Legault (mixing on Turquoise Dreamer).<br/><br/>We also want to acknowledge and thank the staff at Artscape Daniel's Launchpad (the studio at which we tracked drums and bass), and Beck Ganon for connecting us to the studio and donating 30 hours of studio time to Ashley for the album. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p><strong>WE DID IT - WE REACHED OUR GOAL OF $7000!! We have unlocked new rewards for everyone at all reward tiers.</strong></p>
<p>Even though we've reached our goal, you can continue ordering rewards until our supplies run out!</p>
<p><strong>Since reaching $7000, all contributors at all reward tiers will now also receive Crissi Cochrane guitar picks, a 5x7 postcard featuring a portrait of Crissi created by Delaney, and hand-written thank you notes!</strong></p>
<p>Our original goal was set at the lowest end of our budget. Upon reaching that first goal, we decided to push forward with <i>stretch goals</i>. The more funding we raise, the more co-op hours Delaney can work on this project (which is a part of her Animation degree at Sheridan College), and the more loving detail that she can render in our finished work!</p>
<p>When we reached our first stretch goal of $5000, we unlocked the creation of bonus features (an Artist's Commentary Cut and an Interview with the Artists) and a digital download of Crissi Cochrane's entire digital discography (dating back to 2006!) for all contributors. </p>
<p>Contributors will be receiving your digital download of Crissi's discography in August, and all perks will be shipped out by the end of August/early September. We'll also be contacting you over the summer to provide details about the Early Screening Event that we'll be holding just for you via Zoom in September.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for helping us fund this project - we are completely overjoyed by all your kindness and support!</p>

<h2>About WHY: Animated Music Video</h2>
<p>Windsor, Ontario pop/soul singer-songwriter Crissi Cochrane wants to create her first-ever animated music video! The project, to be animated by Sheridan College student (and Windsor native!) Delaney Beaudoin, will accompany Crissi's upcoming single ""Why"".</p>
<p>Animation is a such a beloved medium for story-telling, with a limitless capacity for creative exploration - breaking the laws of physics, suspending disbelief, and manifesting rich imaginary worlds. But it's also a time-intensive process, and artists deserve to be paid - and paid well! - for their work. </p>
<p>In exchange for contributing to this project, you'll be entitled to receive some very special perks to thank you for your support. Plus, the warm, fuzzy feeling of knowing that you helped two independent artists follow their dreams and create a piece of art that the whole world will enjoy!<br/> </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Video Concept</h3>
<p>This animated music video accompanies Crissi's upcoming single, ""Why"", a bittersweet and expressive pop/soul song all about missed connections in romance, and inspired by the true story of two people who continually cross paths at the wrong time. </p>
<p>In the video, a seamstress will be creating garments that come to life around her, and enact scenes from her romantic past. It's a whimsical and artistic concept, set in the early 1900s, with vintage sewing tools and techniques. </p>
<p>The animation style is to be done in 2D and hand-drawn, inspired by the works of Studio Ghibli (Totoro, Ponyo) and Nickelodeon's Avatar and Legend of Korra series. </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What Goes Into an Animated Video?</h3>
<p>Production is expected to last 18 weeks. From design, script, storyboarding, rough and clean animating, compositing, and editing, this project will take anywhere from 270 to 720 hours of work to complete. That's a <i>tremendous</i> amount of time! Which is why you don't see more animated music videos, as most musicians don't have access to budgets significant enough to undertake this kind of project.</p>
<ul>
<li>While our Indiegogo funding goal is set at $3000, the actual cost for this project is estimated to be in the ballpark of $8000. We've applied for grant funding from the City of Windsor and the MVP Project, and are awaiting results of our applications.</li>
<li>As Delaney is an animation student currently enrolled at Sheridan College, this project will be a co-op credit for her animation degree. (So cool!)</li>

<h3>Making It Happen</h3>
<p>Over the past dozen years, Crissi has created 3 albums, 4 EPs, 8 music videos, produced countless special events and tours, written dozens of grants, and co-founded a record label. Being a self-managed artist requires a lot of careful planning and follow-through, and Crissi is devoted to making this particular project happen! Crowd-funding takes a lot of dedication, which Crissi has experienced first-hand in funding 3 different crowd-funded projects over the years, including the most recent vinyl pressing of her 2020 album <i>Heirloom</i> on vinyl.</p>
<p>We'll be hustling to get as many eyes as possible on this campaign, and continuing to scout for other sources of funding throughout the summer. </p>

Photo credit Satchyn Mital</i></p><h3>About Nocturne </h3><p>I composed Nocturne while living in Kolkata, India as part of an <a href=""https://www.indiastudies.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">American Institute of Indian Studies</a> Performing Arts Fellowship from 2013-2014. This project weaves my experiences of studying evening and night ragas with <a href=""http://prattyush.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Prattyush Banerjee</a> with the vibrancy of nighttime festivals, marketplaces, and rituals I experienced in Kolkata. In this work I wanted to explore the intersection of my experiences with jazz and raga music as well as my experiences of physical and sonic density that occur at night in Indian cities. The term Nocturne was made famous by European composers <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnes_(Chopin)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Frédéric Chopin</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Field_(composer)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">John Field</a>. These pieces often depict a calm pastoral approach to night music with a voice like melody and accompanying arpeggiated chords. Through this project I seek to disrupt this traditional European view of the Nocturne by drawing on Hindustani <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samay"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">time theory</a> and jazz improvisation to offer a different perspective. The night can also be a place of vibrancy, action, and dissonance. My hope is that this music will bring awareness to our own hybrid nature and offer a unique perspective on the concept of the nocturne. </p><p>-Aakash Mittal</p><div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/nA-7onoRal0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>About Awaz Trio</h3><p>The Awaz Trio sculpts sonic landscapes, pointalistic textures, and angular melodies from Indian and American improvised music.

<h3>The album celebrating 25 years of our music! </h3>
<p>For many years the legendary gypsy brass band <i>Fanfare Ciocarlia</i>’s purpose has been to make great music that inspires people to dance, be free and enjoy life. For almost 25 years, they have released over 12 albums and played countless shows around the world, topping world music charts and international festivals. Through their music they have kept alive a <strong>unique centuries-old gypsy culture</strong> from their home country of <i>Romania. S</i>haring it around the world, accumulating a host of in fans,and inspiring new genres within world music, bands, and festivals. Their music has featured in Hollywood films such as <strong><i>Borat</i></strong>, and some of their most prestigious live shows include the <strong><i>Nobel Peace Prize </i></strong>and <i><strong>NPR Tiny Desk</strong></i>. </p>
<p>To celebrate our 25th anniversary as a band in 2021, we had planned to record, release and tour a <strong>special album <i>‘It Wasn’t Hard to Love You’</i></strong> (an ode to our fans). However, COVID 19 put a stop to this! We usually fund our albums through income from live shows, but due to the Corona crisis we cannot play live, and because we cannot play live we can not fund the album! </p>
<p>We wracked our brains, creating ever more elaborate plans to find the money to fund the album. The thought of not being able to make it made us very sad, as  to us this would be our most important release, a celebration of our fans, and possibly our last ...</p>
<p>Then it struck us!!!  Why don't ask <strong>all the</strong> <strong>amazing fans and music lovers across the world to become a part of this milestone album by donating to fund it!</strong></p>

</div></div>","The album celebrating 25 years of our music! 
For many years the legendary gypsy brass band Fanfare Ciocarlia’s purpose has been to make great music that inspires people to dance, be free and enjoy life. For almost 25 years, they have released over 12 albums and played countless shows around the world, topping world music charts and international festivals. Through their music they have kept alive a unique centuries-old gypsy culture from their home country of Romania.

Their music has featured in Hollywood films such as Borat, and some of their most prestigious live shows include the Nobel Peace Prize and NPR Tiny Desk. 
To celebrate our 25th anniversary as a band in 2021, we had planned to record, release and tour a special album ‘It Wasn’t Hard to Love You’ (an ode to our fans). However, COVID 19 put a stop to this! We usually fund our albums through income from live shows, but due to the Corona crisis we cannot play live, and because we cannot play live we can not fund the album! 
We wracked our brains, creating ever more elaborate plans to find the money to fund the album. The thought of not being able to make it made us very sad, as  to us this would be our most important release, a celebration of our fans, and possibly our last ...
Then it struck us!!!  Why don't ask all the amazing fans and music lovers across the world to become a part of this milestone album by donating to fund it!

<h3>About</h3>
<p>My name is Lindsay Holifield and I'm a singer-songwriter, visual artist, and poet based in Birmingham, Alabama. </p>
<p>During my 14 year struggle with an eating disorder, I discovered my voice, which has sustained me even in the darkest of places. From the walls of hospitals and treatment centers, carrying around a ukulele or finding a dusty keyboard hidden in a corner, I found that music was what brought me to life. </p>
<p>Many of my songs reference mental health struggles, transforming the pain into something beautiful.  A number of the songs also reference the confusing, painful reality of fundamentalist religious systems that taught me (and too many people I know) fear and shame. This is my story, put in lyrics and melodies.</p>
<p>I've been brave for a long time in battling my own demons, but now I'm doing something big and brave again in asking for my community to come alongside me and brings this project to life.</p>

<p>Our goal is to raise $8,000. This will cover costs of production, studio time, musicians, engineers etc.  We will be recording in Nashville, TN, with <a href=""https://www.carriewelling.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Carrie Welling</a> as the producer.</p>
<p>As an incentive, there are five tiers of perks, a few of which utilize my other creative skills - creative writing and visual art. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While these songs come from my own story, I am giving voice to pain that resonates with many people who have also experienced fear-based religion and mental health struggles.

<p>It is always a risk to be incredibly honest and raw with art. It might make some folks uncomfortable and there is a part of me that badly wants every person who exists ever in the world to love my art.

Our music is a post-apocalyptic dance party with heavy, sinister grooves, cinematic melodies, and freak-jazz experimentation. Since our first show on Halloween 2011, we’ve been lucky enough to play all over the United States, to have our music featured in several films and shows, and to make two albums (the second of which made it into the Chicago Reader’s “Best Chicago Albums of the 2010s” list). </p><p>We’re now ready to release our 3rd full length album: THE DEATHSHIP HAS A NEW CAPTAIN. Composed over the last three years, this 10 song album is heavier, wilder, catchier, groovier, and more immersive than any of our music in the past. In short, it’s more Gramps The Vamp than Gramps The Vamp has ever been before.  </p><p>We are SO proud of this music and can’t wait to send it out into the universe, but we need more funds to finish the job. Making an album is expensive and since we are not affiliated with a record label, the funds can only come from ourselves and our supporters. This campaign is to bring our community together to try and make this album a reality. If you like what we do, please consider pledging for a copy of the record or one of the other perks we’re offering. Every little bit helps.</p><p>We are truly grateful for all the love you’ve shown us over the years and can’t thank you enough for the support! </p><p>Your friends,</p><p><strong>Gramps The Vamp</strong></p><p> </p><p>You can check out our previous albums at:</p><p>grampsthevamp.com</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>What We Need</h2><p>Here’s a breakdown of the costs of releasing this record:</p><ul>

<li>Record Jackets: $600</li>
<li>Album Art: $500<ul><li>    Total: $6800</li></ul>
</li>
</ul><p>Since we’ve already invested some of our own money into recording, we lowered our goal for this campaign to <strong>$6000</strong>. If we surpass our goal, we’ll put that money toward a publicity campaign to help get the word out about our music.</p><p> </p><h2>What You Get...</h2><p>The number one thing we hope you get from this campaign?… a copy of the record! However, if you’re interested in something different we’ve got you covered at all these different levels. <strong>Please note: all perks $15 and above get the new album in either digital format, vinyl format, or both. </strong></p><h3>$1 - Thanks from the band for joining our campaign!</h3><p>Even if you don't have a lot of cash to spend, you can make a difference in our campaign by putting your name on our list of supporters.

Frankly, if we didn’t crowd fund our record releases, they just wouldn’t happen. By getting your copy of the album here, you’re allowing this music to be published! </p><p><strong>You make touring possible!</strong> We can’t stress enough how important selling vinyl is to our bottom line when on tour. Selling vinyl turns music sales directly into gas and food money on the road, without which we could not make touring work. By funding this album you’re helping us spread the word about our music!</p><p><strong>You make earning a living as a musician possible!</strong> In order to save up enough money to pay for vinyl record manufacturing ourselves, we’d have to take a big pay cut at our shows for probably several years. Having the album funded by our fans allows us to collect our full cut from the gigs we play, which in turn helps us pay the bills as professional musicians.</p><p> </p><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>This is not our first time releasing an LP on vinyl. We know what to expect in this process and are confident we can get a great album out to you. The biggest risk to the project would be delays during the manufacturing process. Sadly, this is a more likely possibility this time due to a devastating fire that recently destroyed Apollo Masters, one of the main plants that supplies the industry with lacquers (an important part used to make vinyl records). As a result, there are expected to be delays in the vinyl manufacturing process. We’re not exactly sure how this will effect our project, but we will be sure to keep you updated on the expected release date. Currently, we think a safe estimate for the release date is August, 2020. </p><p>There's a smaller risk that one of our three shirt designs might not generate enough interest to be profitable for us to make. If that is the case, we'll reach out with the options of a different shirt or a refund. </p><p> </p><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>We understand that sometimes donating your hard earned cash is not an option. If you can’t donate but you still want to help out, please give the campaign a share on social media. The more that people visit this page, the better chance we have at reaching our goal. </p></div>","We’re Gramps The Vamp... a seven-piece band from Chicago. Our music is a post-apocalyptic dance party with heavy, sinister grooves, cinematic melodies, and freak-jazz experimentation. Since our first show on Halloween 2011, we’ve been lucky enough to play all over the United States, to have our music featured in several films and shows, and to make two albums (the second of which made it into the Chicago Reader’s “Best Chicago Albums of the 2010s” list). We’re now ready to release our 3rd full length album: THE DEATHSHIP HAS A NEW CAPTAIN. Composed over the last three years, this 10 song album is heavier, wilder, catchier, groovier, and more immersive than any of our music in the past. In short, it’s more Gramps The Vamp than Gramps The Vamp has ever been before.  We are SO proud of this music and can’t wait to send it out into the universe, but we need more funds to finish the job. Making an album is expensive and since we are not affiliated with a record label, the funds can only come from ourselves and our supporters. This campaign is to bring our community together to try and make this album a reality. If you like what we do, please consider pledging for a copy of the record or one of the other perks we’re offering. Every little bit helps.We are truly grateful for all the love you’ve shown us over the years and can’t thank you enough for the support! Your friends,Gramps The Vamp You can check out our previous albums at:grampsthevamp.com  What We NeedHere’s a breakdown of the costs of releasing this record:
Recording: $2500
Mixing: $1000
Mastering: $700
Vinyl Pressing: $1500
Record Jackets: $600
Album Art: $500    Total: $6800

Since we’ve already invested some of our own money into recording, we lowered our goal for this campaign to $6000. If we surpass our goal, we’ll put that money toward a publicity campaign to help get the word out about our music. What You Get...The number one thing we hope you get from this campaign?… a copy of the record! However, if you’re interested in something different we’ve got you covered at all these different levels. Please note: all perks $15 and above get the new album in either digital format, vinyl format, or both. $1 - Thanks from the band for joining our campaign!Even if you don't have a lot of cash to spend, you can make a difference in our campaign by putting your name on our list of supporters.

<h3>Candy in a Nutshell (so like... honey roasted pistachios?)</h3>
<p>Riah here, the self-appointed spokesperson of The Penny Candies. My colleagues and I are on a mission to bring our whimsical-indie-folk-pop-with-a-new-orleans-flair music to life in a very happy-go-lucky Frankenstein kind of way. Why would we want to do that? Because we're creators, it's in our bones to want to make music and share it! And if you're like me, maybe you're tired of only finding our/my music on YouTube (aside from our single, I Do What I Want, of course). Either way.  ""It is time!"" -Rafiki</p>
<p>And schucks... It's been a long time comin'. For our new fans and followers, that may seem like *fiction* because The Penny Candies are technically a new band which makes us musical babies... but if you rewind roughly 12 years, you'd see the 20-year-old version of myself with a handful of songs and a dream. Rewind 17 years before that and you'd see an ACTUAL musical baby. Singing ""You're Cheatin' Heart"" into a spoon in my living room. But that was then. And this is now.</p>
<p>And now... this army of ONE has become an army of SIX (I have the best bandmates everrrrrr who breathe life into all of my songs!) and we're ready. We're ready but we need your help!</p>
<h3>Ingredients List:  </h3>
<p>Over the years I've written over 100 songs and we've narrowed it down to roughly 30 that we're really into as a band. And if with your contributions we get the opportunity to professionally record 10 of those, then hecks! Hecks yeah that would be a dream come true! The ugly truth is that it is not a cheap process, making an album. The beautiful truth is that we have a really amazing team on our side, ready and able to make some musical magic once they get the call. From producers to studio musicians to artists of every kind, I've never felt more confident in our ability to create dazzling, professional-grade songs that kind of punch you in the face. In a good way. </p>
<ul><li>So what do we need? </li></ul>
<p>We're asking for $10,000 to produce our debut full-length album. So... We need $1. Ten thousand times.</p>
<ul><li>Where does all that money go?</li></ul>
<p>Between paying for studio time and bringing musicians in... collaborating with producers and then sending the songs off for their final varnish (the mixing and mastering process) it boils down to roughly $1000-$1200 per song, conservatively. So if we're real smart about it, which we will be, then that number paints a very realistic picture. We've been preparing for this our whole lives and we don't wanna blow it if you know what I mean? And we want to make sure your pennies are being used in the most effective way.</p>
<ul><li>What if we don't reach our goal?</li></ul>
<p>Well, we'll still head into the studio and produce as many legit songs as we possibly can with whatever funds we DO raise!</p>
<ul><li>What if it exceeds expectations?</li></ul>
<p>We do have some ""stretch goals"" for such an occasion, with MORE and NEW and EXCITING perks for our donors... and of course... we would just record more songs, and have an even longer/better album than originally planned and that does not sound half bad, my friends. </p>
<h3>Calories:</h3>
<p>So. What do you get out of it? Well, you'll get some hel-la sweet and tasty songs, for one thing. Like, really fun and unique jams that add color and flavor to the world. Some of it pulls your heart strings and makes you feel like a Lost Boy in Neverland. Some of it speaks peace to your soul. And some of it makes you feel like a kid at a carnival trying to shoot targets that are shaped like clowns... and then possibly get the feeling that said clowns are following you on your walk home. </p>
<p>Also! Perks. We've got some fun rewards and perks for our FUNders! (And to my BFF in Australia, you can be our Funder Down Under!) From vintage-inspired shirts and stickers to original art to house shows and beyond... we've got some tricks up our sleeves and we're super excited about them! We're excited about the whole dang thing! We'd love it if you joined The Penny Candies family for a really fun adventure!</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous:</h3>
<p>Thanks for taking a gander. If you can't personally contribute... don't sweat it! You can still help! Just share our campaign with your friends and family and co-workers and dog groomers and help us get the word out!</p>
<p>And that's all there is to it.</p>

<p> Hi! I'm a singer-songwriter and guitarist from New England who has lived in Austin, TX since 2003. I have been writing songs since I was in high school. My first CD, ""Colored in Poetry, "" was released in 1998 and received a Boston Music Award Nomination. Since then I released two other recordings: ""Bet on the Wind"" (2001) which features Mary Chapin Carpenter guitarists <strong>Duke Levine</strong> and <strong>Kevin Barry</strong>, and ""Next To You"" (2008), which features <strong>Ruthie Foster</strong>, <strong>Scrappy Jud Newcomb</strong>, <strong>Warren Hood</strong>, and Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame Inductee <strong>Ian McLagan.</strong></p>
<p>The next CD is going to be called <strong>""Any Kind of Angel""</strong> after a song I wrote about desperate farmers needing any kind of help they could get. I didn't know it at the time, but I needed that kind of help too.</p>
<h3>I'm Going to Tell You the Whole Truth</h3>
<p>I don't know how to tell you why I need help without making this personal.</p>
<p><strong>I began this recording project in 2012</strong>, and currently it is about 70% finished. The whole thing was put on hold in 2013 because everything in life was put on hold when my wife, singer-songwriter Kerry Polk, began experiencing late symptoms of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. We began seeing early signs of the disease in 2008 but they were largely invisible. We kept it to ourselves. But the symptoms just kept getting worse and eventually we had to be public about what was happening. I became her caretaker until she passed away in late 2017.</p>
<h3>What I Have Learned</h3>
<p><strong>Love Wins</strong>: Thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court Kerry and I were married. And she left this world knowing she was loved by many, especially me.</p>
<p><strong>Despite What Happened, Kerry and I Are Actually Very Lucky</strong>: We endured the whole experience rich in love and friendships that still give me courage today.</p>
<p><strong>Since Kerry's passing I have been trying to fund the recording myself</strong> and have gotten pretty far. But there are a few more songs and instrument parts to record, and after that there are production and publicity costs such as mixing and mastering the recording and streaming (Spotify) promotion.</p>
<p><strong>Finishing this project is the best way I know to anchor a new life. </strong>I want to keep playing.</p>
<p>I began this project funding it myself and could continue to do so. But it will be at least another year to get it done, and that will mean a 12 year gap between recordings. With your help it will be released sooner and it will be a better recording.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Here's What I'm Going to Do When ""Any Kind of Angel"" is Finished</h3>
<p><strong>Release downloads</strong>: Wanna single? I'm planning on releasing downloadable singles as they are completed. No more waiting for a whole CD. When 10-12 singles are done, I'll release a collection of them.</p>
<p><strong>Gig more</strong>: New recordings give venues new reasons to book me for shows. Yay!</p>
<p><strong>Travel more</strong>: Spotify and traditional radio promotion may garner enough attention for me to book shows in other cities, including places in New England where my family is. I also plan to attend Folk Alliance next year to reconnect with industry professionals and book more shows.</p>
<p><strong>Write more</strong>: My life slogan is <strong>""Work hard. Be nice. Keep moving.""</strong>  Physics says a body in motion stays in motion. An active writer writes more. Playing more means writing more.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What I Need...</h3>
<p>Here is a breakdown of what your contribution will help cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Studio costs</strong>, such as recording engineer expenses and musicians like Jaimee Harris, Warren Hood, BettySoo and Scrappy Jud Newcomb!</li>
<li>
<strong>Publicity</strong>: I'm going to use social media of course. And I'm going to get advice from professionals about how to get the word out. Why? It's a noisy world.</li>
<li>
<strong>Traditional radio and Spotify promotion</strong>: I want to get the songs out there. Why Spotify? Where do you listen to CDs?</li>
<li>
<strong>CD manufacturing costs</strong> and shipping expenses to mail them to radio stations</li>
<li>If I don't reach the final goal I will scale back the post-recording plans and probably not do traditional radio promotion. The music will get out there via Spotify, social media and word of mouth.</li>

<p>Award winning vocalist <strong>Stephanie Adlington &amp; Aaron Lessard</strong> are thrilled to announce the creation of their debut EP.

<h3> </h3>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Hello there...</i></h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Welcome to my Indiegogo campaign in support of my new studio album, ""Ozark Symphony""!</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I personally invite you to join me on the ground level of this record's creation. Your support (both through the years and now) means so much to me, and I look forward to sharing the heart and soul of this experience with you in the days ahead! </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Read on to learn more about me, this project, and producer Dirk Powell...</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3><i>About Me:</i></h3>
<p>I am a Kansas City-based Folk/Americana musician with a penchant for old instruments (especially the banjo variety) and the kinds of soulful stories and songs that seem to live  inside of them.</p>
<p>I was born into a musical home in Memphis, TN and grew up around an eclectic mix of influences ranging from old-school country, 60s folk, bluegrass, and delta blues to jazz, opera, and classical music. After graduating college, I rambled around for a few years in search of a career before moving to Kansas City, MO and finally embracing my life-long love of music as my profession.</p>
<p>I released my debut album ""Even the Sparrow"" in May 2019 along with my long-time musical collaborator, Staś Heaney. With the help of our manager Al Berman, Staś and I spent the bulk of 2019 on the road, touring in support of the album, which—to our great surprise and delight—was nominated as a finalist for <i>The International Folk Music Awards</i> ""Best Album of 2019""! </p>
<p>Spending so much of last year on the road, touring from coast to coast, was a beautiful new chapter in my musical journey. Now a new leg of that journey has begun, with production officially underway for the making of my sophomore album, ""Ozark Symphony.""</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>About Dirk Powell:</i></h3>
<p>In addition to being an acclaimed producer, Dirk Powell is a musician with deep roots in several rural American traditions. He learned banjo and fiddle from his Kentucky grandfather, James Clarence Hay, and has been a part of the thriving Cajun/Creole music community in Louisiana since his early 20s. </p>
<p>Recognized as a leading expert in Appalachian fiddle and banjo, Powell has won 4 GRAMMYS; appeared on the Today Show &amp; David Letterman; recorded &amp; toured with the likes of Rhiannon Giddens, Eric Clapton, Loretta Lynn, and Joan Baez; and has also contributed to various film scores and soundtracks. Additionally, Dirk's solo records, which often combine a traditional foundation with a wide-ranging commitment to emotion and original expression, have had impact around the globe.</p>
<p>Dirk runs his own studio on the banks of Bayou Teche near Breaux Bridge, Louisiana. His latest recording, “When I Wait For You,” was released to wide-spread acclaim on <i>Compass Records </i>in September 2020. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>About this Record:</i></h3>
<p>I have appreciated Dirk's work (both his original work and his work as a producer and recording engineer) for years now. I had the good fortune of crossing paths with him at the<i> Folk Alliance International Conference</i> in New Orleans in January 2020, and a few months later, we approached him about collaborating with us on this record.</p>
<p>In August, Staś, Al, and I met up with Dirk in the heart of the Ozarks for a weekend brainstorming session. Over the course of those few days together, our vision for the record came naturally and beautifully into focus. ""Ozark Symphony"" was selected as the title track, as it seemed to set the tone for the record as a whole. The songs on this album chart a course from the Ozark Mountains, through my hometown of Memphis, and down into Cajun country and back again. These songs are born of the people, places, and stories that are nearest and dearest to my heart, and which have shaped the contours of my very life and being.</p>
<p>Dirk—with his varied  background in Appalachian, Celtic, and Cajun music traditions—is bringing such vibrance and musical depth to these songs, both as a producer and multi-instrumentalist. My dear friend and long-time duo partner, Staś Heaney, is also a multi-instrumentalist and integral collaborator on this record. Additional members of the studio ensemble include a talented cast of musicians lending percussion, reeds, strings &amp; keys. A veritable Ozark symphony...</p>
<p>At the end of September, we journeyed down to Bayou Teche to record the basic tracks for the album at Dirk's <i>Cypress House Studio</i>. In the weeks and months ahead, we will finish recording and move on to mixing, mastering, and finalizing the album for release in Spring 2021.</p>
<p>The funds raised by this campaign will make it possible for us to make this record the best that it can possibly be. This has truly been a next-level experience for us and a pinnacle moment in our musical journey thus far. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your encouragement, your goodness, and your generous support in helping to bring our creative vision for this album fully to life. </p>

Welcome to my Indiegogo campaign in support of my new studio album, ""Ozark Symphony""!
I personally invite you to join me on the ground level of this record's creation. Your support (both through the years and now) means so much to me, and I look forward to sharing the heart and soul of this experience with you in the days ahead! 
Read on to learn more about me, this project, and producer Dirk Powell...
 
About Me:
I am a Kansas City-based Folk/Americana musician with a penchant for old instruments (especially the banjo variety) and the kinds of soulful stories and songs that seem to live  inside of them.
I was born into a musical home in Memphis, TN and grew up around an eclectic mix of influences ranging from old-school country, 60s folk, bluegrass, and delta blues to jazz, opera, and classical music. After graduating college, I rambled around for a few years in search of a career before moving to Kansas City, MO and finally embracing my life-long love of music as my profession.
I released my debut album ""Even the Sparrow"" in May 2019 along with my long-time musical collaborator, Staś Heaney. With the help of our manager Al Berman, Staś and I spent the bulk of 2019 on the road, touring in support of the album, which—to our great surprise and delight—was nominated as a finalist for The International Folk Music Awards ""Best Album of 2019""! 
Spending so much of last year on the road, touring from coast to coast, was a beautiful new chapter in my musical journey. Now a new leg of that journey has begun, with production officially underway for the making of my sophomore album, ""Ozark Symphony.""
 
About Dirk Powell:
In addition to being an acclaimed producer, Dirk Powell is a musician with deep roots in several rural American traditions. He learned banjo and fiddle from his Kentucky grandfather, James Clarence Hay, and has been a part of the thriving Cajun/Creole music community in Louisiana since his early 20s. 
Recognized as a leading expert in Appalachian fiddle and banjo, Powell has won 4 GRAMMYS; appeared on the Today Show & David Letterman; recorded & toured with the likes of Rhiannon Giddens, Eric Clapton, Loretta Lynn, and Joan Baez; and has also contributed to various film scores and soundtracks. Additionally, Dirk's solo records, which often combine a traditional foundation with a wide-ranging commitment to emotion and original expression, have had impact around the globe.

<h3>INTRODUCTION:</h3>
<p>Hello friends,</p>
<p>Welcome to my IndieGoGo. Thank you very much for taking the time out to visit. My name is Owen, and I make music under the alias of ""Owsey."" I've been writing music for over a decade now, ranging from Ambient &amp; Cinematic, all the way to more contemporary Pop/Singer-songwriter. The overarching theme that ties all of this music together is a kind of atmospheric melancholia, and inspiration taken from my own life experiences and stories is what keeps it going. The vast majority of you already know this, so allow me to explain the purpose of this campaign:</p>
<p>I recently finished and released a new album titled ""Atlas and The Cruel World,"" 5 years on from my 1st album ""To The Child Drifting Out At Sea."" As happy as I am with the new album, I felt like in retrospect a lot of things were left unsaid, and I want to use this platform to create a brand new and elaborate grand sequel album to Atlas. This new album will be much bolder in its scope, and will tell the ending to the story in a way that is more emotive and impacting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607541955/brcl5ffpgilbqmkqtjne.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHY HELP OUT?</h3>
<p>I'm creating this IndieGoGo campaign so that I can confidently devote all of my time to creating this album. With the almost unbelievable success of my first campaign and a huge 18 track album that followed, I'm confident that this time around things will be even better. Any and all contributions will have an impact by providing me with the opportunity to create an album to the highest quality possible. These contributions will allow me to invest in new instruments and tools to strengthen the overall sound of my music in a very tangible way. Financing equipment has always been a limiting factor as it tends to be very expensive. I'm truly excited for the prospects this could open up, and for the difference it would make to my music. So by supporting this campaign, you'll become a part of what will ultimately be my strongest work so far.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need:</h3>
<p>I'm hoping to secure £7000 worth of funding. This will mostly cover manufacturing of physical goods, shipping and processing fees. It will also allow me to comfortably devote the next 3-4 months to actually creating this album without having to rely on freelance and lengthy commission work. As mentioned above, I will also be able to purchase new equipment that will lift my sound up to greater heights by using much more effective tools. You might wonder why I'm not asking for as much funding as the previous IndieGoGo campaign if this album is to be stronger in every way - this is mainly because my skills have improved in that time, and I no longer have to hire the likes of session musicians to perform some of the instrumentation. Because this will all be down to me, I can lower the costs significantly. I can also take care of the artwork and some of the merchandise without outsourcing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607551857/l0aocvnwj1jz8vcdgftw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What You Get:</h3>
<p>I'm going to be offering quite an extensive range of perks. such as:</p>
<p>- <b>CDs </b></p>
<p><b>- Access to Walkthroughs and Project Files</b></p>
<p><b>- The opportunity for me to write an exclusive song for you</b></p>
<p><b>- The opportunity for me to name a song after you</b></p>
<p><b>- Collaborate with me</b></p>
<p><b>- Let me Remix your song, or someone else's song</b></p>
<p><b>- Artwork Packages</b></p>
<p><b>- Handwritten Thank You Notes</b></p>
<p><b>- Critical Appraisal</b></p>
<p><b>- Stickers</b></p>
<p><b>- Digital Copies</b></p>
<p><b>- Access to 10 Unreleased Tracks</b></p>
<p><b>- Postcards</b></p>
<p><b>- &amp; more!</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607541999/okhgjf0jexp7bnilmmwv.png"" src=""""/></b></p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3></div><div>
<p>If you are unable to contribute that's perfectly fine - any shares or spreading of the campaign would be well and truly appreciated.</p>
<h3>To Conclude:</h3>
<p>I would be endlessly grateful to anyone who wishes to support this campaign, and will endeavour to make sure that the perks and album you receive in return will be well worth your investment. Making music really is my life - I spend most of my days and nights creating it, and I would love nothing more than to continue doing this, and to grow as an artist and a person along the way, sharing songs consistently with all of you. I truly hope you'll consider joining me on this journey. Thank you very much for stopping by, and if there is anything at all that I can help you with, please message me either here, on social media (links below) or by email: owseymusic@gmail.com</p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ABOUT SABRINA CHAP</span></h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Sabrina Chap, a NY based cabaret artist and songwriter who's hoping to produce my third studio album, 'Make Way for the DJ'. This collection of songs inspired by my time writing for burlesque, circus and cabaret is eight years in the making. From heartbroken ballads to the delightfully perverse, this album will be a testament to the joy of live performance in it's many forms.<br/> </p>
<p>I've been touring for years, and unfortunately, less and less people buy music. As album sales flounder, I'm turning to my audience, fans and friends - old &amp; new - to support the songs I've sung on cabaret stages from Iceland to LA. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WORDS OF PRAISE FOR MY WORK!</strong></p>
<p>★★★★★ ‘Like a piano player in brothel or a chanteuse at an orgy, Sabrina Chap is the fallen woman of cabaret….’ – Broadway Baby</p>
<p>★★★★★ ‘...intoxicating -  a must see for cabaret fans.’ – Deadline News‘A burlesque Jerry lee Lewis’ – The American Magazine</p>
<p>‘Think Eartha Kitt. Think female Tom Waits. Think nihilistic Cole Porter.’ – Somna Theatre</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am shooting for a funding of $5,000, even though I know I will probably need around $8,000 to truly make this project heard. All of this money would go to hiring musicians, engineers, studio time and paying fellow artists (photographers, designers) to create the final product.</p>
<p><br/><strong>PERKS</strong>!</p>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li><p>Downloads or Physical copies of 'Make Way for the DJ'</p></li>
<li><p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">A print of the final album cover, featuring contortionist, Ekaterina and taken by photographer, Maike Schulz.</span></p></li>
<li><p>A small booklet of lyrics from each album, as well as the stories behind the songs.</p></li>
<li><p>A small booklet detailing my 'Worst &amp; Best Gigs' from 10 years on the road.</p></li>
<li><p>Piano/Songwriting lessons</p></li>
<li><p>I will write a song with or for you.</p></li>
<li><p>Postcard from me on the road.</p></li>
<li><p>One insane perk is that I am using all of the sales from another unreleased project, 'Postcards from the Rearview Mirror' to fund this studio album. 'Postcards' is an electric guitar based abstract musical telling the tale of two queer teens who leave the violence of their Florida homes for the bright lights of Hollywood. This musical departure has acted as a palate cleanser to my collection of funny, cabaret tinged songs. It is fully orchestrated, with great performances by some incredible musicians, and was engineered in my bedroom by me. It's good, I promise. ;)<br/> </p></li>
</ul>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal - all the money will still go to funding the album. It is in my heart to get this music out there, and everything I raise will go towards the release of these songs, inspired by cabaret, burlesque, circus and the joy of live entertainment.<br/> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>By donating, you are supporting an independent solo female artist with a fiercely feminist voice. </p></li>
<li><p>You are also supporting a touring musician who has written this album as a testament to the power of live entertainment. </p></li>
<li><p>I have carried my piano across the US and the UK to bring these songs to stages, live. Your support  gives me confidence in my work and voice to do that. Your support is why I lift that goddamn piano.<br/> </p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

</div></div>","ABOUT SABRINA CHAP
Hi! I'm Sabrina Chap, a NY based cabaret artist and songwriter who's hoping to produce my third studio album, 'Make Way for the DJ'. This collection of songs inspired by my time writing for burlesque, circus and cabaret is eight years in the making. From heartbroken ballads to the delightfully perverse, this album will be a testament to the joy of live performance in it's many forms. 
I've been touring for years, and unfortunately, less and less people buy music. As album sales flounder, I'm turning to my audience, fans and friends - old & new - to support the songs I've sung on cabaret stages from Iceland to LA. 
 
WORDS OF PRAISE FOR MY WORK!
★★★★★ ‘Like a piano player in brothel or a chanteuse at an orgy, Sabrina Chap is the fallen woman of cabaret….’ – Broadway Baby
★★★★★ ‘...intoxicating -  a must see for cabaret fans.’ – Deadline News‘A burlesque Jerry lee Lewis’ – The American Magazine
‘Think Eartha Kitt. Think female Tom Waits. Think nihilistic Cole Porter.’ – Somna Theatre

 
What We Need & What You Get
I am shooting for a funding of $5,000, even though I know I will probably need around $8,000 to truly make this project heard. All of this money would go to hiring musicians, engineers, studio time and paying fellow artists (photographers, designers) to create the final product.
PERKS!


Downloads or Physical copies of 'Make Way for the DJ'
A print of the final album cover, featuring contortionist, Ekaterina and taken by photographer, Maike Schulz.
A small booklet of lyrics from each album, as well as the stories behind the songs.
A small booklet detailing my 'Worst & Best Gigs' from 10 years on the road.
Piano/Songwriting lessons
I will write a song with or for you.
Postcard from me on the road.
One insane perk is that I am using all of the sales from another unreleased project, 'Postcards from the Rearview Mirror' to fund this studio album. 'Postcards' is an electric guitar based abstract musical telling the tale of two queer teens who leave the violence of their Florida homes for the bright lights of Hollywood. This musical departure has acted as a palate cleanser to my collection of funny, cabaret tinged songs. It is fully orchestrated, with great performances by some incredible musicians, and was engineered in my bedroom by me. It's good, I promise. ;) 

If I don't reach my entire goal - all the money will still go to funding the album. It is in my heart to get this music out there, and everything I raise will go towards the release of these songs, inspired by cabaret, burlesque, circus and the joy of live entertainment. 
The Impact
Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:

By donating, you are supporting an independent solo female artist with a fiercely feminist voice. 
You are also supporting a touring musician who has written this album as a testament to the power of live entertainment. 
I have carried my piano across the US and the UK to bring these songs to stages, live. Your support  gives me confidence in my work and voice to do that. Your support is why I lift that goddamn piano. 


Risks & Challenges
The hardest thing about being an independent songwriter these days is that very few people buy albums anymore, making it impossible to fund new work by counting on album sales. For this reason, it took me 8 years to self-produce 'Postcards from the Rearview Mirror'. I really rely on the small number of fans I've cultivated in touring the US & UK for over 8 years in hoping to fund the songs I've written to entertain. 

My greatest hope is that this album will be funded by fans, allowing my work to be heard by a greater platform.
I am hoping to tour this album and book greater gigs from it, spreading my songs to the weird and wonderful people I feel are my intended audience. Please help me get my music out there so that this can happen!

<h2><strong>THE ALBUM ""ALPHA &amp; OMEGA"".</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Greetings! The music industry is changing and it's been a hard year for all musicians and bands, but hopefully things will change for the better.</strong></p>
<p>Your help means everything! Together many people can make things happen.</p>
<p>Being a small band with your own little lable is very hard and expensive. Even though Gaia Epicus has sold a lot of albums and had almost only great reviews on all albums, it is still hard to manage to make new music and release it on cd.</p>
<p>There has been a demand for this album to be available on cd, and therefore we are trying out this crowd funding campain.</p>
<p>On this campain the prices are set a little high, and there are no fancy gifts like t-shirts, posters, stickers etc... All this costs money! And to include stuff like that the total amount we need would be higher. The lowest cost is also a little high and the reason is so that we need less people to have a successful resault. If we have 60 people buying the lowest reward then we have reached our goal and the cd will be printed. Of course if we also have some Keepers Of Time and Wizards out there we will need less people.</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627002231/kgaynfayvnty35qcff6c.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/><strong>Why is the goal 1500 euros?</strong></p>
<p>Printing an album is very expensive, and there are other related costs also.<br/>One of them being shipping wich is very expensive.</p>

<p>   Hi everybody, I’m Don Merckle. I’m a singer/songwriter based out of Charleston SC and I need your help finishing my new album so I can get it out into the world and HOPEFULLY into your hands.</p>
<p>   I am REALLY excited about this record. I wanted to stretch my legs creatively, get outside of my comfort zone, and work with talented new people that I’ve never worked with before and grow as an artist. I wanted to challenge myself to make something new and different from my previous albums, a record that if you’ve followed my music in the past, you probably wouldn’t expect from me. I’ve never been more excited or proud of anything I’ve made as I am about the songs I’m recording right now, and I can’t wait for you not just to hear them, but to experience them. And I really need your help to get me to the finish line. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622728278/k1glldmffnns95gn7tnm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>   But wait there’s more! The creative thread doesn’t end with just the record. It extends to a visual component, which for me, are VIDEOS! So far, I’ve been able to make 3 videos for singles that are going to be on this record, with almost no budget at all. I just had some ideas and some talented friends that could help me make them into something cool. So, I’ve been able to do this with almost no resources. I really believe that with a little bit of money behind it, we could make at <i>least</i> 3 more videos. And with the additional funding behind them, that we could do something really amazing.  I mean, if we can make what we have so far with almost nothing, imagine what we could do with your help! </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>   So a video for me isn’t just a visual representation of the song, it’s more like a short film, a story or a journey of what the song looks like to me.  When I make a video, I’m trying to use visual images that help connect you guys to the feelings and emotions that I was experiencing when I wrote the song, or when I was recording it, because my other passion besides music is filmmaking. So, the songs are like the soundtrack to the movies playing in my head. I can’t think of a better way to share that experience with you than to make a really cool and creative video that is not only visually stimulating but also something you haven’t seen 100 times before. Something with a creative point of view.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>   I hate asking talented people to do stuff for free. But I have. A lot. Probably too much at this point. And I feel like I have called in all the favors from my amazing and creative friends that I can. It would be incredible to actually give them a little something for all the time and energy that they give to these projects for me. I assure you, they are more than worth it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>   So please check out the perks and options. If you would like to just straight donate that would be <i>AMAZING</i> (just hit the <strong>BACK IT</strong> button at the top) but there are many perks to be had because it’s important to me that you are not giving me something for nothing!

I studied Circus in Québec City and for the past few years I’ve been combining my two passions on stage, going from playing the doublebass to jumping on a trampoline.</p><p>For years I’ve been thinking about recording a solo album. I started my musical career with the electric bass, and later on learned to play the scottish bagpipes, the guitar, the irish whistle and the double bass. I never imagined that my first solo album would be mainly on acoustic guitar but Covid-19 and all the lockdowns gave me the unexpected opportunity to delve deeper into the fingerstyle world and provided me with the tools and inspiration to write new music. Since the beginning of 2021, I’ve been working on a <strong>10-original-compositions album</strong>, entirely played on acoustic guitar, with other instruments like bass guitar or low whistle added on some tracks. The music you hear in the background of the campaign’s video is going to be in the album, and you can find more samples on my instagram account <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/floriangmusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@floriangmusic</a>.</p><p>The album will be named ""<strong><i>Polar Eclipse</i></strong>"" and, as you maybe guessed, it was inspired by climate and environmental issues. There are no lyrics in the album but every track was inspired and named after an environmental topic, but I will let you discover all about this when the album comes out.</p><p>I knew from the moment I started playing fingerstyle guitar by covering <strong>Antoine Dufour</strong>’s musics that I was going to need a high quality professional guitar. Since I live in Finland, I looked for Finnish guitar makers and I found the amazing Olav Loef from<strong> <a href=""https://www.loefguitars.fi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Loef Guitars</a></strong>.

I studied Circus in Québec City and for the past few years I’ve been combining my two passions on stage, going from playing the doublebass to jumping on a trampoline.For years I’ve been thinking about recording a solo album. I started my musical career with the electric bass, and later on learned to play the scottish bagpipes, the guitar, the irish whistle and the double bass. I never imagined that my first solo album would be mainly on acoustic guitar but Covid-19 and all the lockdowns gave me the unexpected opportunity to delve deeper into the fingerstyle world and provided me with the tools and inspiration to write new music. Since the beginning of 2021, I’ve been working on a 10-original-compositions album, entirely played on acoustic guitar, with other instruments like bass guitar or low whistle added on some tracks. The music you hear in the background of the campaign’s video is going to be in the album, and you can find more samples on my instagram account @floriangmusic.The album will be named ""Polar Eclipse"" and, as you maybe guessed, it was inspired by climate and environmental issues. There are no lyrics in the album but every track was inspired and named after an environmental topic, but I will let you discover all about this when the album comes out.I knew from the moment I started playing fingerstyle guitar by covering Antoine Dufour’s musics that I was going to need a high quality professional guitar. Since I live in Finland, I looked for Finnish guitar makers and I found the amazing Olav Loef from Loef Guitars. Olav has been making acoustic guitars for 40 years, and his guitars are true works of art. Very pleased by their sound and their look, I got mine in the beginning of 2021, which also contributed to the inspiration for this album. You can find out more about this guitar in this video : www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdaqQDFVfcAnd if you want to have a look at Olav’s work: www.loefguitars.fiAnalog recordingI'm not sure if it was pure luck or the universe sending me a message that I stumbled on a very unique recording studio, Astia Studio, in the city I had recently moved in.

If monetary support isn’t possible for you now, spreading the word to your friends and family or sharing our music on Spotify would also be a great help. We'll be releasing some live-in-studio videos, interviews and other content throughout the campaign until we can trance with you in person again. No matter what, we are committed to making this record a reality.  Thank you for your consideration, and we appreciate your support!LINKSClub d'ElfClub d'Elf on SpotifyMike RivardMoroccan sintirGnawaNass el-GhiwaneDean JohnstonBrahim FribganeMister RourkePaul SchultheisJohn MedeskiDuke LevineKevin BarryDavid FiuczynskiAmit KavthekarChris Rival/Middleville StudioDanny Blume",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is this about? </h3>
<p>Every year when it snows, I have a tradition of listening to a song that to me, encapsulates the feeling of winter and snow. I got the idea to write instrumental songs of my own that also expressed that and it became a 4-song EP called Gift of the Night Flurries. The album also features a bonus track of a Christmas Carol mash-up that I released a few years ago.</p>
<p>After letting Monica Molina listen to the songs, she got the idea to turn it into a dance collaboration. So, on December 11th, we will not only be releasing the album, but also having a World Premiere dance performance to Gift of the Night Flurries by IndoRican Multicultural Dance Project, choreographed by Teresa Cuevas. For those who can't make it to the release event, we will also be holding a livestream of the pre-recorded performance at a later date to be announced. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Producing an album can get expensive! We have album production costs including musicians, mastering, and physical album printing. For the release event, we also need to pay for the venue, dancers, costumes, any catering we might have (dependent on what's allowed at that time), and miscellaneous costs that come up in putting on such an event. Any money will go directly to paying for all of these items, priority going to paying the people making this happen. If we make anything over our goal, it would be split between the dancers, choreographer, and musicians. </p>
<p>In order to raise the money, we have a ton of rewards! You can get:</p>
<p>-Tickets to the event (in-person or the livestream)</p>
<p>-A copy of the album (digital or a signed physical copy mailed to you)</p>
<p>-An 8x10 print of my photo: <a href=""https://www.krystlehenningerphotography.com/snow#e-0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gift of the Night Flurries</a> signed or unsigned, up to you!</p>
<p>-A copy of the event poster signed by the dance company</p>
<p>-Producer or Executive Producer credit for the event</p>
<p>-Meet &amp; Greet after the event</p>
<p>-An invitation to a rehearsal!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why do this? </h3>
<p>By having this event, we are not only releasing music, but supporting and opening the doors to future collaborations between musicians and dancers for this project. There has already been talk of potential for an additional event down the road in a completely different part of the US, which would be amazing. Seeing the impact and getting feedback from where things are right now gives me a lot of hope about where this could go. And it's only just beginning! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially, that's okay! It's been a hard year and a half for a lot of people and I completely understand. Spreading the word helps tremendously regardless of whether or not you've financially contributed and helps us get closer to our goal! </p>

<h3><i>Reencuentros</i></h3>
<p>For my first solo album, I decided to go to the roots of my musical upbringing, and share with you where it all started. I have always been impressed by the beauty and sophistication of Latin American songs, which I heard in my mother's voice since I was a kid. When I put together the repertoire for the album, I noticed that most of the existing recordings were made around the 80's, so I found myself with the mission of reviving these musical jewels and bring them to you in a refreshed way. </p>
<p>Every time I sing Latin American songs in front of an audience, I always get the question: <i>Have you considered recording an album with this music?</i>  This idea has been growing in my mind, and now I am happy to offer it to you, and make it a reality, with your support. </p>
<h3>Who is in my team?</h3>
<p>As you see in the video, I will be working with a great group of people. I have worked with all of them in the past, and I can say that their expertise and reputation gave me the confidence of wanting to record this album.  I want to mention two wonderful additions to this team, -not mentioned in the video- that make this album even more valuable.</p>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanton_Alspaugh"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Blanton Alspaugh</a>, Producer.</p>
<p>He is a multiple Grammy-Award record producer. I had the honor of meeting him when I recorded as a soloist in the Grammy-Winning album <i>Duruflé: The Complete Choral Works, </i>which he produced. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.davidhanlonmusic.com/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">David Hanlon</a>, Music Arrangements. </p>
<p>Composer, conductor, and a long time colleague and friend, David will arrange some of the songs. He will give them a new life, and I can't wait to show you what he comes up with. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For this project, my goal is to raise 15,000 that will help me cover the main expenses of the production. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Promoting these Latin American songs goes beyond the mere desire of sharing their beauty as pieces from the past, but reaching out to new audiences, and singers that would like to include these pieces in the Spanish repertoire. Just like we enjoy a jazz standard, I want to show people how much more music it is out there that we can also embrace and appreciate. Promoting Latin American repertoire is one of my main goals as a singer. </p>

We are a small custom guitar shop Badstroke with great passion for use of exotic woods and expert craftsmanship. Our mission is to bring beautiful high quality guitars  or the lowest possible prices.
Come take a look at some of the work we have already done on our famous Semi-Customs. They heavily influenced how your very own Fiend Series may look like. Please bear in mind that some aspects of each guitar may vary depending on your specific configurations. Now let's get you introduced...
 


 

 








 
Due to COVID, past months were hard on musicians around the world. As we see guitar lovers and artists often struggle financially, we thought about what we can do for the community we feel to be part of.
We need YOUR help to start a production of a new Fiend Series that will be of highest quality for absolutely the lowest possible price. How low? about 60-70 % cheaper than most custom shops you probably know. To be able to do all this, we need to move to new bigger workshop and buy a lot of new tools to be able to deliver on our promises. Right now, we need your help and we offer  more than just a mere thanks in return.
 


 

Your name will be engraved into our Tablet of Fame in shape of guitar placed in our custom shop headquarters in Prague. Also, you will be the first to know updates about this Indiegogo campaign!
 

FIEND SERIES are high quality guitars and basses in astounding handcrafted quality. Inspired by the best of the best ever sold in Badstroke Guitars custom shop. This is where all the magic starts! 
Let's get to it!

<h2>LITTLE BROWN JUG BRASS </h2>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Little Brown Jug Brass Band, is a quirky, joyful, exuberant brass band which revels in providing a fun and unique perspective on dance tunes and who take pride in ensuring our audiences have a fantastic time – with a few laughs along the way!<br/><br/>Founded by Jevon Hills who got his music degree in Tuba Performance (yes, you read that right) we are a multi-generational group of musicians with fine arts degrees, music degrees, and post-secondary music training who insist on working within a fun, co-creative, collaborative environment.  We focus on enjoying the best gifts music has provided us – camaraderie, light-heartedness, connection, and laughter.  <a href=""https://littlebrownjugbrass.com/meet-the-band/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://littlebrownjugbrass.com/meet-the-band/</a></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604878321/ctb1aktotkt0ywltrf2z.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Why It’s Important For Us To Make Our EP</h3>
<p>By late spring of 2020, and after many socially distanced band get-togethers, we recognized that the Coronavirus had not only affected us emotionally, but had really taken its toll out on our community as well. At a time when Calgary usually flourishes with outdoor festivals and live concerts, not even our beloved world-renowned Stampede &amp; Rodeo could survive the fallout and was cancelled for the first time in 100 years.</p>
<p>We decided then and there that we would perform outdoor social distancing concerts, and were blown away by the response.  Initially imagining we would play our “Boulevard Brass Parties” for a few households, the requests poured in!  Birthday parties, block parties, Pride gatherings, community family festivals; no matter where we played, neighbours ranging in ages from toddlers to great grandmothers would be attracted to the party.  Heck, we even stopped a city bus in the middle of the street when the driver stopped to open his window and listen for a few minutes!  Everyone was as hungry as we were to safely connect, enjoy music, and have their spirits raised. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604878449/gr1ilrgx5pstyha7st7z.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We recognize our community is much larger than just Calgary.  Many of us heard from friends and family from all over the world who fervently wished they could hear us play.  We would love to bring our cheerfully eccentric music to a wider audience so that they too might be able to dance gleefully, if even for a moment. </p>
<h3>Our Project</h3>
<p>Our crowd-pleasing Boulevard Brass Parties illustrated to us how truly popular our musical viewpoint is with so many different demographics.  Everything ranging from our unique arrangements of covers to our own compositions were so well-received that we collectively made the decision to pool all the funds raised from our “Covid Tour 2020” and put them towards booking a recording studio in the new year.  (With safety protocols in place, of course.)  We are planning to record (budget depending) between <strong>3-6 songs </strong>for our first EP. Good news – we already have enough for the studio fees!  It would be greater news if we could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hire a professional Producer who ‘gets brass’ to work with us in the studio</li>
<li>Hire a quality sound engineer who also ‘gets brass’ to mix and master</li>
<li>Get the mechanical rights to some of our favourite covers</li>
<li>Hire a videographer to capture the recording process, and create a video of one of our original compositions</li>
<li>
<s>Craft beer </s> - OK, scratch that.  We’ll pay for our own beer</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>We’ve already raised enough to get in the studio.  And, we’ve set it up so that if we don’t reach our entire goal, we can still create a fun product that we can share with a global community at a time when we could all use a light-hearted distraction.  But, your help would go towards our ability to release a much higher quality product, and allow us to introduce ourselves to a larger audience on multiple media platforms. </p>
<p>Your support means the world to us.  Literally.</p>

</div></div>","LITTLE BROWN JUG BRASS 
Who We Are
Little Brown Jug Brass Band, is a quirky, joyful, exuberant brass band which revels in providing a fun and unique perspective on dance tunes and who take pride in ensuring our audiences have a fantastic time – with a few laughs along the way!Founded by Jevon Hills who got his music degree in Tuba Performance (yes, you read that right) we are a multi-generational group of musicians with fine arts degrees, music degrees, and post-secondary music training who insist on working within a fun, co-creative, collaborative environment.  We focus on enjoying the best gifts music has provided us – camaraderie, light-heartedness, connection, and laughter.  https://littlebrownjugbrass.com/meet-the-band/

Why It’s Important For Us To Make Our EP
By late spring of 2020, and after many socially distanced band get-togethers, we recognized that the Coronavirus had not only affected us emotionally, but had really taken its toll out on our community as well. At a time when Calgary usually flourishes with outdoor festivals and live concerts, not even our beloved world-renowned Stampede & Rodeo could survive the fallout and was cancelled for the first time in 100 years.
We decided then and there that we would perform outdoor social distancing concerts, and were blown away by the response.  Initially imagining we would play our “Boulevard Brass Parties” for a few households, the requests poured in!  Birthday parties, block parties, Pride gatherings, community family festivals; no matter where we played, neighbours ranging in ages from toddlers to great grandmothers would be attracted to the party.  Heck, we even stopped a city bus in the middle of the street when the driver stopped to open his window and listen for a few minutes!  Everyone was as hungry as we were to safely connect, enjoy music, and have their spirits raised. 

We recognize our community is much larger than just Calgary.  Many of us heard from friends and family from all over the world who fervently wished they could hear us play.  We would love to bring our cheerfully eccentric music to a wider audience so that they too might be able to dance gleefully, if even for a moment. 
Our Project
Our crowd-pleasing Boulevard Brass Parties illustrated to us how truly popular our musical viewpoint is with so many different demographics.  Everything ranging from our unique arrangements of covers to our own compositions were so well-received that we collectively made the decision to pool all the funds raised from our “Covid Tour 2020” and put them towards booking a recording studio in the new year.  (With safety protocols in place, of course.)  We are planning to record (budget depending) between 3-6 songs for our first EP. Good news – we already have enough for the studio fees!  It would be greater news if we could:

Hire a professional Producer who ‘gets brass’ to work with us in the studio
Hire a quality sound engineer who also ‘gets brass’ to mix and master
Get the mechanical rights to some of our favourite covers
Hire a videographer to capture the recording process, and create a video of one of our original compositions

Craft beer  - OK, scratch that.  We’ll pay for our own beer

We’ve already raised enough to get in the studio.  And, we’ve set it up so that if we don’t reach our entire goal, we can still create a fun product that we can share with a global community at a time when we could all use a light-hearted distraction.  But, your help would go towards our ability to release a much higher quality product, and allow us to introduce ourselves to a larger audience on multiple media platforms. 
Your support means the world to us.  Literally.

I was also in the studio (a lot) singing my own demos and singing demos for other writers. I'm so grateful to be able to say that some amazing artists have chosen to record some of my songs! When I got the call that Reba McEntire was gonna cut one of my songs, I pretty much freaked out! When I got the call inviting me to come sing on the record, I completely freaked out! :) Reba couldn't have been kinder to me in the studio, that day spent at Starstruck studios was definitely one of the highlights of my music career so far!</p><p>For the last several years, I've been recording and touring as an independent artist. It's the hardest, most rewarding and fulfilling thing I've ever done. Actually, ""independent artist"" is not entirely accurate. I am independent in that I don't have to answer to (or have the financial backing or promotional power of a label) but I'm totally DEPENDENT on the folks who like the music enough to buy our CDs and downloads, book us to perform and support us in so many other ways! <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">My husband Sam &amp; I are completely independent artists, we are our own label, our own publishing company, our own promoters &amp; you got it, I'm my own manager.

That will include studio time, engineers, musicians and a little bit for us to buy groceries during the process. We expect the initial manufacturing cost to be between 3 and 5 thousand dollars - depending on the number of pre-orders. The rest will be used for promotion. There's no sense in making a great record if no one knows about it so we'll hire a publicist to help get the word out. If we exceed our goal, We'll aim toward shooting and promoting another music video. If, for some reason, we don't make our goal, we'll still make the record and you'll still get your perks.

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Hi! We're EJ Olson and Chancelor Reeder, two childhood best friends who grew up playing music together in Portland, OR. We came together in 2019 to create <a href=""http://solo.to/09musicofficial"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">09 [OH-NINE]</a>---a passion project at it's core, meant to be a celebration of everything we love as artists. We decided early on to forgo having a permanent front-person, and instead use this music as an outlet to create with some of our favorite singers!</p>
<h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602150999/mjhradblj3fhjlim0hsq.jpg"" src=""""/> </h3>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>For over a year, we've been working on writing and recording a series of singles, with the ultimate goal of releasing a full length album. So far, we've been completely self funded, and we're proud of what we've been able to accomplish on our own. However, the pandemic changed things for us back in March, when we both found ourselves suddenly out of work. Our plans for the album were pushed back, but we've continued to write music and collaborate remotely with some amazing artists! </p>
<p>In order to finish the record, we're going to need a little help crossing the finish line. For studio time, mixing, mastering, manufacturing, distribution, featured artist costs, PR, music videos and other promotional material, we're looking at an additional cost upwards of $19,000. With this campaign though, we're asking for your help in funding our studio time, mixing, and distribution costs, so we can get this record finished the right way and into your hands ASAP!</p>
<p><strong>The Costs:</strong><br/>Studio Time: $5400<br/>Mixing &amp; Mastering Costs: $2220<br/>CD Manufacturing &amp; Distribution: $850<br/>Indiegogo Perks: $1140<br/>Taxes and Fees: $840</p>
<p><strong>The Album:</strong><br/>Our full length album will feature twelve tracks---remasters of our five previously released singles, as well as <i>seven brand new songs!</i> It will be produced, engineered, and mixed by the legend himself---<a href=""https://www.justinabelaudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Justin Abel</a>.</p>
<p><i>Featured artists include:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Kellin Quinn (Sleeping With Sirens)</li>
<li>Rory Rodriguez (Dayseeker)</li>
<li>Malia Endres (Glacier Veins)</li>
<li>Cove Reber (ex-Saosin, Dead American)</li>
<li>Matty Mullins (Memphis May Fire)</li>
<li>Chris Ratzlaff (Fallstar)</li>
<li>Andrew Serino</li>
<li>Jamie Currie</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>We have several more incredible singers lined up for this record (yay!), but for now, they have to remain a secret (boo!).  Note that if we don't meet our goal, the funds we raise will still go directly toward studio time. If we exceed our goal, that money will go towards funding additional songs for the record!</p>

<h2><strong>The Perks</strong></h2>
<p>Everyone who chooses a physical perk will have their name appear in the album's liner notes!  (Note: Please reach out to the band if you are interested in purchasing the 'Featured Singer' perk, we'll work the details out together before commitment is needed from either party.)</p>

<h3><strong>Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Crowdfunding is a powerful tool that gives us as artists agency over what we create, and a platform to use our own voices, uninhibited by the workings of the music industry. By backing this campaign, you're putting the power back in the hands of creators! </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Times are tough right now, and we understand that many folks are struggling due to the pandemic. If you're a fan of our music, but aren't able to back the cause, don't sweat it! If you still want to support the band, please share this campaign and tell all your friends who the heck we are!</p>

For over a year, we've been working on writing and recording a series of singles, with the ultimate goal of releasing a full length album. So far, we've been completely self funded, and we're proud of what we've been able to accomplish on our own. However, the pandemic changed things for us back in March, when we both found ourselves suddenly out of work. Our plans for the album were pushed back, but we've continued to write music and collaborate remotely with some amazing artists! 
In order to finish the record, we're going to need a little help crossing the finish line. For studio time, mixing, mastering, manufacturing, distribution, featured artist costs, PR, music videos and other promotional material, we're looking at an additional cost upwards of $19,000. With this campaign though, we're asking for your help in funding our studio time, mixing, and distribution costs, so we can get this record finished the right way and into your hands ASAP!
The Costs:Studio Time: $5400Mixing & Mastering Costs: $2220CD Manufacturing & Distribution: $850Indiegogo Perks: $1140Taxes and Fees: $840
The Album:Our full length album will feature twelve tracks---remasters of our five previously released singles, as well as seven brand new songs! It will be produced, engineered, and mixed by the legend himself---Justin Abel.
Featured artists include:

Kellin Quinn (Sleeping With Sirens)
Rory Rodriguez (Dayseeker)
Malia Endres (Glacier Veins)
Cove Reber (ex-Saosin, Dead American)
Matty Mullins (Memphis May Fire)
Chris Ratzlaff (Fallstar)
Andrew Serino
Jamie Currie

We have several more incredible singers lined up for this record (yay!), but for now, they have to remain a secret (boo!).  Note that if we don't meet our goal, the funds we raise will still go directly toward studio time. If we exceed our goal, that money will go towards funding additional songs for the record!

 
The Perks
Everyone who chooses a physical perk will have their name appear in the album's liner notes!  (Note: Please reach out to the band if you are interested in purchasing the 'Featured Singer' perk, we'll work the details out together before commitment is needed from either party.)





 

Impact
Crowdfunding is a powerful tool that gives us as artists agency over what we create, and a platform to use our own voices, uninhibited by the workings of the music industry. By backing this campaign, you're putting the power back in the hands of creators! 

Other Ways You Can Help
Times are tough right now, and we understand that many folks are struggling due to the pandemic. If you're a fan of our music, but aren't able to back the cause, don't sweat it! If you still want to support the band, please share this campaign and tell all your friends who the heck we are!",7.0,1,"1 Campaign

So we went to New Hampshire, to an A-Frame house on a lake, a studio called Xanadeux.

<p>We've been recording it in Boston since then; and in Brooklyn with producer Jeff Fettig. It sounds very different than <i>Unionism</i>.

<p>Wow. After two months of crowdfunding (and a couple late contributions from a folks who just missed the end of the campaign), we raised just under $8,200 to fund the release of my new album “free”. I am in absolute awe and filled to the brim with gratitude. Thank you just doesn’t cut it. If you purchased a perk with your contribution, keep your eyes peeled for an email from me next month with more details!</p>
<p>Making and releasing music is an exhausting, exciting, overwhelming, terrifying, empowering, liberating, draining, fulfilling, lonely, and joyous process (to say the least). The experience exists far beyond the boundaries of binary thinking - there is no one box or word or category that can encapsulate its multifaceted magic. And then, when you add a village of incredible humans who say “yes let’s make this happen”, the whole thing takes on new depth and meaning.</p>
<p>The support this project has received from all of you - my incredible community of fans, friends, family and fellow musicians - is deeply humbling. I am incredibly honored and forever grateful for your support! Thank you so much to everyone who contributed to or shared the project.</p>
<p>These songs mean a lot to me, and I cannot wait to get them out into the world. This will be my very first vinyl release!!! Eee!! I wiggle with excitement every time I think about putting the needle down on my own record! And it’s all thanks to YOU!</p>
<p>Sigh… THANK YOU</p>
<p>Oh! And stay tuned for announcements coming your way next week about the first single from the album ... everyone who contributed to the campaign will get a sneak peak listen to the song!</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THE PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>I recorded the album in February 2020 with the help of <a href=""http://www.evanhamilton.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Evan Hamilton</a> and <a href=""http://www.mikemckenzieonline.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mike McKenzie</a>. Holed up in a wee flat outside Edinburgh, Scotland, the three of us dove deep into the music, arranging and producing each song as we went. The process was intuitive, collaborative and organic – full of missteps, laughter, happy accidents, and moments of pure brilliance. I am so proud of what we captured during those six days.  </p>
<p>Now, a year later, I am in the throes of creativity - collaborating with photographers, artists, videographers, and sound engineers to bring the music and art of <i>free</i> to life. I cannot wait to share it all with you!</p>
<p><strong>But I need your help to make it happen!</strong></p>
<p><strong>What your contributions mean…</strong></p>
<p>Making an album is an incredibly expensive endeavor – it takes time, courage, faith and a pretty big chunk of change. By contributing to my campaign, you’ll be helping me to pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Musician fees</li>
<li>Recording &amp; production expenses</li>
<li>Artwork &amp; photography</li>

<li>Printing the album</li>
<li>Merchandise</li>

<p>If we surpass our goal of $6,500, I may even be able to print vinyl (a lifelong dream)!! There are lots of great perks to choose from, or you can simply donate.</p>
<p>I know from past experience that it takes a village to bring a project like this to life, so I hope you will consider donating and being a part of my village!</p>

<p>I have an epic team behind me. To create my album I'm joining forces with producer Nat Keefe. He has worked with many artists in the bluegrass genre including  Bonnie Pain (of Elephant Revival), Fruition, and his own band Hot Buttered Rum. Nat will also be playing music on the album itself! We have chosen Tiny Telephone Studios, in San Francisco, to be the chrysalis from which this album emerges.  </p>
<p> I am so honored to have my Husband Jeffrey Honeyheart,  Philip Brezina of the Brother’s Comatose, and Robert James Ryan III of All Else Is, blessing the album with their genius artistry.  I will be recording nine original songs in an uplifting and fun style that allows their healing power to shine through♥</p>

I've created some unique perks here for you to make sure that you're splendidly rewarded for your contribution!

<h3>Recorded in Isolation. </h3>
<p>We came together in 2020 and recorded dozens of songs. Isolated in our own home recording rooms, we sent digital audio tracks back and forth, finding a crazed workflow of creative refuge.  Jill happened to track the vocals for the song ""Hell is Other People"" during the insurrection on Jan 6th, and this Sartre quote became the title of the finished album.</p>
<p>When the dust settled we found ourselves with thirteen songs that we were able to fully finish, resulting in an LP and EP. We were pleased to have David Gaumé mix and master the EP and Ross Brown mix the LP with Eureka Mastering preparing it for vinyl. <br/><br/>The EP, ""Land of the Blind"" will be digitally released in late June, as well as on cassette. <br/>The LP, ""Hell is Other People"" will be digitally released in fall 2021, as well as on vinyl.</p>
<p>So far all of our expenses to record, mix, master, and package these projects have been out of pocket, as we are not on a record label. We are hoping you can help us with the final expense of having the physical vinyl and cassette units produced by preordering them here. There is no risk involved, we will go through with producing these in tangible form no matter what because we have already put so much work into this project.</p>
<p>Thank you SO much in advance for your support!</p>

<p>Redder Moon began as one of Jeremiah James Gonzales’ many music projects. A more electronic and obscure sound than much of his other work (including Knife Crime, Be/Non, Rhunes, Elevator Division, Umberto), the sentiment of a melodic post-apocalypse slowly developed for the first seven years, also involving past members Matthew Naquin (original collaborator) Nick Banister (drums) and Jon VanSickle (live drums)</p>
<p>Brody Lowe moved to Kansas City from Portland, in 2019 met Jeremiah and quickly found his place in reviving the layered synths and dance undertones of the moody, mostly instrumental music. Lowe is a quiet presence behind a large scope of music videos, album art, and other creative content, his music ranging from video game scores and band collaborations to his solo project, Loqsa. </p>
<p>Just as Gonzales and Lowe began collaborating on new material ranging from darkwave to shoegaze to synthpop genres, Jill McKeever joined as a vocalist/lyricist during the uncertain year of 2020. A violinist in her early music projects led her to a degree in Electronic Art where she explored video and music recording. McKeever’s perfume brand, For Strange Women induced a 13-year detour from music before she found her way back during the quiet of quarantine. </p>

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is Ginni, I'm a jazz vocalist who loves to worship! Over the past three years, I have been blessed to have the opportunity to lead worship for my congregation in Philadelphia. During this time I have been creating and sharing several of my worship songs that I have written over the past years. My musical background is in jazz, where I have studied jazz vocals and have gigged over the past 10 years. However, through my experiences I have found that there is truly nothing more fulfilling than to create and sing songs to God, while leading others to God through worship. This is why I have started this worship project, in order to take action by professionally recording four of my worship songs that fully express the creative voice and calling that God has placed in my heart. I strongly believe that now is the time to share these worship songs for the encouragement of the body of Messiah and to be a light to the whole world.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/0OMLJirFSKs?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>I have connected with a believing music producer from Nashville, Tennessee who will be overseeing the production of this music project. The funds from this campaign will go directly to producing four of my worship songs, which we will be releasing as singles separately throughout the year. In order to share these songs I will need to raise $8,500 total. Specifically, the majority of the funds (85%) will go directly towards studio recording time, professional musicians, mixing, and mastering of each of the songs. The remaining funds (15%) will go towards music videos, cover art, promotions, and administration expenses. </p>
<p>It would be such a blessing for you to partner with me in this journey and I’m so excited to share this with you, encourage you, and pray God bless you as you sow into this adventure with me. I have created several fun perks as a way for me to thank and bless you for your contributions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>For the past several years I have been blessed with the opportunity to lead worship in many different settings. Through the worship, I have received testimonies of healing and salvation of all ages! Whenever I share one of my worship songs, someone always comes up to me later and tells me how much it moves them and then they would ask me where they can get a recording. Sadly, I never had anything to give them. But that will change with the fulfillment of this project. I believe these amazing experiences are just a small glimpse of what God wants to do with these songs once they are fully recorded professionally. My goal is to set our gaze up and away from ourselves and our circumstances, while worshipping our Anointed King on His throne as He delights in us. I wholeheartedly believe that this is the time to act in being a light to our suffering world and a part of God’s healing plan!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How you can help!</h3>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to listen to my story! I would love for you to join me in this journey. Please keep me and my team in your prayers as we work on bringing these songs to life and any contribution would go a long way in supporting this project and getting my worship songs out to the world. It would be greatly appreciated if you could spread the word about this project to your communities by sharing this project with your friends. Indiegogo has several quick and easy ways to share this campaign through social media and email.</p>
<p>God bless you and I can't wait to share with you these songs of worship that have been in my heart for many years!</p>
<h3>Thank you!</h3>
<p>There are a few people I would like to thank who have already helped me in this process so far...</p>
<p>To my promise keeping God, Yeshua, Jesus. My husband, Adam, who is my solid ground, stability, security, reliability, and my comforter. Joe Miterko for his enthusiasm, joy, constant encouragement, and friendship. Thank you to Elsie Bennett, for her direction, resources, wisdom, encouragement, and camaraderie. Thank you to Aidan Carter Guynez, for making this beautiful video and really capturing me and my vision at its essence and purity. Thank you to Caleb De Ruiter, for taking and finding footage of me at the Boardwalk Chapel from 5 years ago for this video.</p>
<p>Thank you Dad, for the many hours you spent looking for old clips of me for this video.</p>

We’ve been touring and making records since 2005. We’ve been unsigned and signed to labels. We’ve played shows for thousands of fans, and played shows to a rooms of 3 fans. We feel so blessed and privileged to have met so many amazing people throughout our weird wild journey. We love making music and plan on releasing records forever. </p><p>As many of you know, since 2016 we have been writing for our new album. And I am so so  happy and proud to say it is finally finished and even better than our last record. After more than 4 years, 63 song demos, and lots of frustration/joy, I again can say that I believe all good things take time. The road to this new record was long, but we’re almost there!!!</p><p>So many of you have helped us to continue making music these past 4 years. Our album <i>FUTURE GOLDEN AGE</i>, and our other band Northlander’s <i>FORCES OF LIGHT</i>, would literally have never existed without your help, and now these records have taken us around the world, and reached half a million ears in total streams. That is incredible for a small band like ours, and I really hope these records brought some joy into your life. Now here we are once again, sitting on a fully written album with the promise that it will absolutely rule, and we need your help to make it happen!</p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What We're Offering</strong></p><p>The name of our new album is <strong><i>SUNBREATHER</i></strong>. It contains 11 of our best songs yet. Here’s the things we need to pay for to make this possible, and the unique perks we are offering for this crowdfunding campaign.</p><p><strong><u>Production</u></strong> - In order to bring out the best possible version of these songs we can, we are getting these songs mixed by Ryan Furlott and mastered by Mike Kalijian of Rogue Planet Mastering(My Chemical Romance, A Day to Remember, Paramore). Mike and Ryan did all the work for the Northlander record and Ryan mixed our last Fallstar record as well. They do amazing work and we know they would make these songs sound incredible. </p><p><strong><u>Music in Physical Format</u></strong> - For this release we are offering <strong><i>SUNBREATHER</i></strong> not just on CD but on Vinyl as well. This is something we have always wanted to offer, and this felt like the record to make it happen.</p><p><strong><u>Merch</u></strong> - Rewards for this crowdfunding effort.</p><p>With everything said and done, we should be able to clear all of these expenses if we raise $5,000. All the money we raised in streaming the last Fallstar album went to pay for most of the Northlander album, and we hope if we make any money off streams from <i><strong>SUNBREATHER</strong></i>, that this too will fund another Northlander album. See how that works?! </p><p>In this campaign we’re offering some pretty cool new perks and rewards, and we're trying to make it as special as possible. Along with offering the album on Vinyl, some packages will include a Fallstar COVERS album! In this collection of songs we’ll take a crack at some of our favorite songs by P.O.D., Rage Against the Machine, and DC Talk, to name a few. We are also opening the second half of the record to requested songs. I am excited and terrified to see what some of you will make us do:) -please no bohemian rhapsody… please- We're also offering more of Bryan’s custom made sweatshirts from SLEEPLATE.CO, and this time we made girls shirts too! And finally, for the sake of history and future trips down memory lane, selected rewards feature your name in album credits and a polaroid thank you card from us. Also if this record is funded I promise to make a podcast about this record, just like the one I did for <i>FORCES OF LIGHT</i>.</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>As we are currently an independent band, we exist solely on the support of our friends and fans of our bands. After completing 2 successful crowdfunding campaigns we are even more humbled by that fact. 159 individuals brought FUTURE GOLDEN AGE to the world, and 60 people helped us complete the process of bringing FORCES OF LIGHT to life. Those aren’t huge numbers. While some of our songs have over 100k listens, it really is a small group of people who keep us alive as a band, and these crowdfund campaigns are our bread and butter.

<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Please watch the video above!   </h3>
<p>Hi!  My name is Matt Herren, and I am a neo-traditional country singer/songwriter on a mission to bring REAL country music back in style (and hopefully to the radio again)! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621626807/mpctxaunoehpweggw10o.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Matt Herren at Hilltop Recording Studio in Nashville, TN. </p>
<p>This is my first BIG, legit studio album that I have ever made!  I dreamed of making beautiful music that true country fans miss complete with: </p>
<ul>
<li>the steel guitar and fiddle </li>
<li>songs with simple melodies and lyrics that speak to you</li>
<li>NO pop or rap beats - REAL drums only!!! </li>
<li>Stories that everyday people can relate to - God, Country, Family, and Hard Times! </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>So far, we have achieved that with my upcoming album titled <i>American Dream</i>.  You can hear some clips of the songs I have recorded already in the video up above and see some of the making of them in videos below.  I wrote or cowrote three of the songs on the album (<i>The Grass Ain't Always Greener, What Country Is To Me, and The Love Of My Life).  </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The remaining 7 songs were all carefully chosen from thousands of songs that were pitched to me from amazing songwriters in Nashville and all over the US- a few were grammy-award winning.  A couple are severely underrated songwriters and remarkable musicians.  I am honored to be able to cut their songs.   I've chosen each song on purpose because it spoke to me, and I felt it emotionally.  I think that's what REAL country music does for us.  </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Recording American Dream (the title track song) </p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>Right now, I am working with my producer Tony Ray Jones and my wife and music manager, Heather Herren, on finalizing the arrangements for the second half of the album.  Tony is AMAZING at his job.  These songs are gonna knock your socks off!  It's gonna be killer!!!!!  (Well, hopefully it won't kill you - but more like entertain you.  Haha!)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621612091/rdgumzxrxjwsm30zomf5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Matt Herren and Producer Tony Ray Jones </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The lineup is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>a sad, cheating ballad (I mean, what's more traditional country than that?)</li>
<li>a couple upbeat, blue collar living songs</li>
<li>a shaking your fist at the government song</li>
<li>a couple love ballads</li>
<li>a ballad about living with loss</li>
<li>a waltz about what true country music really is to me</li>
<li>an upbeat, mid-tempo song about living life to the fullest</li>
<li>an upbeat song about having fun with your significant other</li>
<li>a mid-tempo drinking song (can't leave that out of a REAL country album)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you could reach into my head, pull out my thoughts about life, and turn them into songs - it would be this album.  </p>
<p>Tony helped me assemble the perfect band to bring these songs to life including Grammy-award winning, legendary guitarist, Brent Mason.  If you don't know who Brent Mason is, his most famous signature lick is the intro to Alan Jackson's Chatahoochee.  Man, can that guy play!  </p>
<p> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Brent Mason, Tony Ray Jones, and Matt Herren </p>
<p>I am also blessed to have Lonnie Wilson on drums.  He was the drummer in George Strait's Ace In The Hole Band.  Bruce Bouton played my favorite instrument - the steel guitar.  He played steel on all of Garth Brooks' records.  He's also a phenomenal songwriter and co-wrote a song on Brooks' ""Ropin' The Wind"" album.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621614470/ujyojdccee6hvhksd6vm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Bruce Bouton on steel guitar and Matt Herren  </p>
<p>I've also been blessed with Joel Key on acoustic guitar, Duncan Mullins on bass, Aubrey Haynie on fiddle, and Johnny Brown on piano.  These guys are the A-team, and they are making this record sound PHENOMENAL!!!! </p>

<div>In addition, I was fortunate enough to get award-winning vocalists, Chip and Billy Davis, as my backup singers.  They toured with Alabama as backup singers, and are grammy-award winning songwriters, as well.  </div>

<div style=""text-align: center;"">      Billy Davis, Chip Davis, Matt Herren, Heather Herren </div>
<div> </div>
<p>I am planning to market this album everywhere, and I expect GREAT BIG things to happen once it is released late this fall.  My goal is to start touring by the end of the year.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Now, for the purpose in this campaign.  </strong></h3>
<p>I chose to be an independent artist so that a record label couldn't hijack my music, overproduce it with pop and rap beats, and turn it into something that I don't like.  I don't think fans of country music would like that either.  I think those of us who love country music miss when it ACTUALLY sounded country!  For me, it's ALL ABOUT THE ART!  As an independent artist, a label doesn't get to tell me what to do!!!!!!  </p>
<p>-Not that I am fully against labels.  If one offered me a record deal but didn't try to change me into pop or bro country, I'd be crazy to say no.  But I doubt that will happen in today's day and age of digital drumbeats and crossover genres forced on the radio.  </p>
<p>Since I am an independent artist without a label, I have to finance EVERYTHING!  I paid for the first half of the album out of pocket with my own hard-earned money.  But, as you can imagine, creating a radio-quality record with this A-team band ain't cheap!  My wife and I sold our second car and emptied our savings account to do the first half because this is <strong>MY</strong> American Dream.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621616046/spszqevioujfawfbbgfl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>So I am asking you to partner with me on financing the remainder of the album.  YOU can collectively be my label!  In exchange, you will get rewarded with some AWESOME, EXCLUSIVE and LIMITED-EDITION perks that <strong>CANNOT</strong> be purchased at any other time.  Once this crowdfunding campaign is over, the opportunity to get these perks will be gone, too.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How I Will Spend The Money</h3>
<p>The goal that we have set is: $13,972.  That includes the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Studio time at the legendary <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMwzR3BAPOo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hilltop Studios in Nashville, TN</a> (infamous studio where legends like Dolly Parton, Alan Jackson, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn and MORE have recorded back in their heydays!)  </li>
<li>Session musician pay</li>
<li>Producer and sound engineer fees</li>
<li>Travel to Nashville (we will have to stay for almost a week to finish the album).</li>
<li>Indiegogo payment processing fees</li>
<li>CD printing</li>
<li>Perks manufacturing and shipping</li>
<li>Songwriter splits / mechanical royalties</li>
<li>Graphics and photography </li>
<li>Lunch for the band on recording day.  (This may not seem like a necessity, BUT short of doing something CRAZY like robbing a bank or dancing naked around a pole, I'll do whatever I have to do to get these A-lister band members to come back and play on my record. Haha!) According to EVERYONE who is ANYONE in Nashville, that's how it used to be done in the good old days before LA took over.  Since my mission is to bring old country back in style, why not treat the band the way they used to be treated when Nashville was still Nashville? These guys are legends, and they deserve to be treated as such.  So if a couple hundred dollars to cater lunch in is what makes them happy, then I am gonna make that happen if I can! </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If we happen to overfund (Lord, Jesus please let us overfund), I will put that money toward a publicist, album release party, digital marketing campaign, a tour manager, and a booking agent. What good will it do to have this PHENOMENAL REAL COUNTRY ALBUM if no one hears it???  My ultimate goal is to go on tour, promote this album, and meet some of my fans in person!  </p>
<h3> </h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How YOU are rewarded for your contribution.   </strong></h3>
<p>We have some AMAZING PERKS for you.   If you are on a mobile phone, you will see them scroll across the top. On a computer, they'll be on the right-hand side of the screen.  Some perks include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Physical CD with limited-edition 20+ page, custom insert including lyrics, photos from recording the album, and more!  It will also be autographed.  </li>
<li>Matt Herren 2022 Calendar. (I think this is weird because I wouldn't want a calendar with 12 of my photos in it.  But when I polled my fans, that's what they said they wanted.  So, we're gonna make it happen.  Haha!)</li>
<li>Autographed photo</li>
<li>Album T-shirt </li>
<li>T-shirt/CD combo - save 12% when you bundle.  </li>
<li>One hour private video chat with me (and of course I'll serenade you, too!) for $99! </li>
</ul>

<h3>EVERYONE GETS THE MUSIC!!!!!!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The last time I ran a crowdfunding campaign, I had a digital CD download code as an option.  It went over well, but some people were confused about when they were getting a digital download and when they were getting a physical CD.  </p>
<p>Also, I noticed that some of my fans could only afford a certain amount, and they really wanted to help.  So they bought the most expensive perk that they could afford, which may have left them without the ability to also get the music.  For example, they purchased a limited edition tee (because it cost more and they felt like they were contributing more), but then they couldn't afford to buy the music.  </p>
<p>I also had some fans that couldn't afford more than a couple dollars.  They contributed what they could, but they couldn't afford even the digital CD.  </p>
<p>What I have learned over this last year is that ALL people go through hard times, and country music fans turn to the music for therapy.  I want to make sure that everyone has access to this music -even if they are on a fixed income and can only afford a couple dollars.  So, EVERYONE who contributes to my campaign, even if it is only $3 to get your name on the website, will get a FREE download code for the FULL ALBUM!  </p>
<p>You heard that correctly: THE ENTIRE ALBUM!!!!  I don't want anyone to miss out on experiencing this music because I am SO proud of it!  If you are grieving, you NEED to hear <i>Gone</i>.  That song is so therapeutic.  I really think it will help everyone! </p>
<p>If you are needing an upbeat song to forget your troubles, <i>My Life's A Country Song,</i> is perfect! If you love traditional country, you just can't hear that song and not want to sing along and tap your foot or get up and dance.   </p>
<p>For these reasons, I just feel in my gut that everyone should get to hear the music.  </p>
<p>If you buy the ULTIMATE FAN PACK or a higher priced perk, you will get your code one week early - before everyone else does.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>REWARD FOR CONTRIBUTING EARLY</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I like to pay it back and reward people who are the first to help me out.  </p>
<p>So, if you contribute <strong>ANYTHING</strong> (even $3) in the first 72 hours (Thursday, June 3rd, Friday June 4th, or Saturday, June 5th 2021), I will send you a FREE American Dream (the single) ringtone as soon as the campaign ends.  This ringtone won't be available for download at any other time.  This is the ONLY way to get this ringtone.  </p>
<p>But wait . . . there's MORE!  </p>
<p>In addition, you will also receive two FREE entries into a raffle for a ton of giveaways that we are doing in the middle of this campaign with hand-crafted one-of-a-kind merchandise that will NEVER be available for sale.  You'll be able to purchase more entries into this raffle, but you will get two FREE entries just for contributing in the first 72 hours! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>WAIT!  There's EVEN MORE . . . . </p>
<p>In addition, you'll also get an acoustic, stripped down version of my song <i>What Country Is To Me</i> - the first song my wife, Heather, and I ever wrote together.  This song will be on the album, fully produced with a 7-piece band.  However, while you're waiting on the album to be finished and the perks to be shipped, you'll get this acoustic recording to tide you over.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>*The ringtone and acoustic download will be emailed soon after the campaign ends and the contributions are locked.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Shipping and Pricing</strong></h3>
<p>Shipping anywhere in the US is included in these perks prices, and we made it as affordable as we could for countries outside of the US.  We also had to build in profit to have the money to finish making the music.  So PLEASE keep that in mind when reviewing the prices.  We tried to keep everything as affordable as possible and build in as much value as possible.  However, at the end of the day, the point is to make a profit so we can make some GREET music!  So these perks are fundraiser-item priced. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What Happens If I Don't Reach The Goal</h3>
<p>If we don't reach this goal, we can't make this album quickly.  Plain and simple.  I am asking for the MINIMUM amount needed to finish off this album and fulfill these perks.  I can't cut any corners without sacrificing the quality of the music, so there is no way to do it any cheaper.  SO, if I don't make the goal, the money will be kept in our account until we can save or raise the remainder needed to complete the project and fulfill the perks.  I WILL finish recording this album.  When I am able to do it will depend on how much money I raise during this campaign.  (I don't want you skipping a rent payment or letting your dogs starve, but aside from that, your money is SO important and appreciated NOW more than I could ever describe in words.)  </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>TRUST</h3>
<p>I know sometimes it's hard to trust people on crowdfunding sites - especially if it is someone you have no relationship with or have never met in person.  I get that. I want to reassure you that you WILL get your perks!  I may be just a simple, country boy from Arkansas with not much to my name, but the one thing I have is integrity.  My word is my bond.  If I tell you I am gonna do something, then I do it.  I can't promise much, but I can promise that you can trust me.  </p>
<p>AND, I can promise that you'll LOVE this album if you love REAL country music reminiscent of 90's style country like Alan Jackson and George Strait.   I live to make fans happy, and that is all I am trying to do here with the music and the perks.  </p>
<p>Just to ease your mind . . .Here are some quotes and pics from the first crowdfunding campaign that I did when I raised money for an EP.  (Mind you, this wasn't the same quality music as I am going to be putting out this time.  I didn't have a live band).  I didn't raise enough money to make music to the quality that I wanted to.  However, I promised that I would make a CD to the highest quality of music that I could with the money raised.  I set out to make my fans a CD because they were asking for it, and I delivered one as promised.  </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Matt Pack Cares!</h3>
<p>Here's one final incentive for you to partner with me on completing this album.  I love to give back, and my fans (The Matt Pack) do, too!  As a promise to my entire existing fan group (and any new fans I may acquire during this process), if we reach the entire funding goal, I will donate 150 digital download codes for the entire album to anyone who is currently or has formerly served in the military.  I believe we, as a society, owe them so much more, but this is what we can collectively do to thank them for their sacrifices.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622561911/vaxyc6bqqbuzpizryk02.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will ALSO donate 150 codes to current cancer patients or their family members.  As a former cancer patient with childhood leukemia, I know the stress and toll that illness can take on a family. Music (especially: traditional country music) was the only escape that I had during those trying times.  If I can offer that same kind of escape and coping mechanism, then I am honored to be in a position to be able to do that.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank everyone who has been following my journey and listening to my music, so far.  I owe every ounce of success that I have had to God, my supportive family,  my producer, Tony Ray, and especially my amazing fanbase, <i>The Matt Pack!</i>  Without all of ya'll, I wouldn't be where I am right now.  You have shown me that together, we can move mountains!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So if you are as excited as I am about this new album, what are  you waiting for?  Contribute <strong>NOW.</strong>  Get your desired perks before they're all gone!  We have limited quantities on many of the items so that we can control the manufacturing costs.  Contribute early so that you can get all of the early-bird rewards, and don't miss out on limited quantities!</p>

</div></div>","Operation: Bringing Back
TRUE Country Music!!!! 
                   
 
Please watch the video above!   
Hi!  My name is Matt Herren, and I am a neo-traditional country singer/songwriter on a mission to bring REAL country music back in style (and hopefully to the radio again)! 

Matt Herren at Hilltop Recording Studio in Nashville, TN. 
This is my first BIG, legit studio album that I have ever made!  I dreamed of making beautiful music that true country fans miss complete with: 

the steel guitar and fiddle 
songs with simple melodies and lyrics that speak to you
NO pop or rap beats - REAL drums only!!! 
Stories that everyday people can relate to - God, Country, Family, and Hard Times! 

 
So far, we have achieved that with my upcoming album titled American Dream.  You can hear some clips of the songs I have recorded already in the video up above and see some of the making of them in videos below.  I wrote or cowrote three of the songs on the album (The Grass Ain't Always Greener, What Country Is To Me, and The Love Of My Life).  
 
The remaining 7 songs were all carefully chosen from thousands of songs that were pitched to me from amazing songwriters in Nashville and all over the US- a few were grammy-award winning.  A couple are severely underrated songwriters and remarkable musicians.  I am honored to be able to cut their songs.   I've chosen each song on purpose because it spoke to me, and I felt it emotionally.  I think that's what REAL country music does for us.  
 


Recording American Dream (the title track song) 

 
Right now, I am working with my producer Tony Ray Jones and my wife and music manager, Heather Herren, on finalizing the arrangements for the second half of the album.  Tony is AMAZING at his job.  These songs are gonna knock your socks off!  It's gonna be killer!!!!!  (Well, hopefully it won't kill you - but more like entertain you.  Haha!)

Matt Herren and Producer Tony Ray Jones 
 
The lineup is as follows:

a sad, cheating ballad (I mean, what's more traditional country than that?)
a couple upbeat, blue collar living songs
a shaking your fist at the government song
a couple love ballads
a ballad about living with loss
a waltz about what true country music really is to me
an upbeat, mid-tempo song about living life to the fullest
an upbeat song about having fun with your significant other
a mid-tempo drinking song (can't leave that out of a REAL country album)

If you could reach into my head, pull out my thoughts about life, and turn them into songs - it would be this album.  
Tony helped me assemble the perfect band to bring these songs to life including Grammy-award winning, legendary guitarist, Brent Mason.  If you don't know who Brent Mason is, his most famous signature lick is the intro to Alan Jackson's Chatahoochee.  Man, can that guy play!  
 

Brent Mason, Tony Ray Jones, and Matt Herren 
I am also blessed to have Lonnie Wilson on drums.  He was the drummer in George Strait's Ace In The Hole Band.  Bruce Bouton played my favorite instrument - the steel guitar.  He played steel on all of Garth Brooks' records.  He's also a phenomenal songwriter and co-wrote a song on Brooks' ""Ropin' The Wind"" album.

Bruce Bouton on steel guitar and Matt Herren  
I've also been blessed with Joel Key on acoustic guitar, Duncan Mullins on bass, Aubrey Haynie on fiddle, and Johnny Brown on piano.  These guys are the A-team, and they are making this record sound PHENOMENAL!!!! 
 

The band working together on the arrangement for my original song
 ""The Grass Ain't Always Greener""
 
In addition, I was fortunate enough to get award-winning vocalists, Chip and Billy Davis, as my backup singers.  They toured with Alabama as backup singers, and are grammy-award winning songwriters, as well.  
 

      Billy Davis, Chip Davis, Matt Herren, Heather Herren 
 
I am planning to market this album everywhere, and I expect GREAT BIG things to happen once it is released late this fall.  My goal is to start touring by the end of the year.  
 
Now, for the purpose in this campaign.  
I chose to be an independent artist so that a record label couldn't hijack my music, overproduce it with pop and rap beats, and turn it into something that I don't like.  I don't think fans of country music would like that either.  I think those of us who love country music miss when it ACTUALLY sounded country!  For me, it's ALL ABOUT THE ART!  As an independent artist, a label doesn't get to tell me what to do!!!!!!  
-Not that I am fully against labels.  If one offered me a record deal but didn't try to change me into pop or bro country, I'd be crazy to say no.  But I doubt that will happen in today's day and age of digital drumbeats and crossover genres forced on the radio.  
Since I am an independent artist without a label, I have to finance EVERYTHING!  I paid for the first half of the album out of pocket with my own hard-earned money.  But, as you can imagine, creating a radio-quality record with this A-team band ain't cheap!  My wife and I sold our second car and emptied our savings account to do the first half because this is MY American Dream.  

So I am asking you to partner with me on financing the remainder of the album.  YOU can collectively be my label!  In exchange, you will get rewarded with some AWESOME, EXCLUSIVE and LIMITED-EDITION perks that CANNOT be purchased at any other time.  Once this crowdfunding campaign is over, the opportunity to get these perks will be gone, too.   
 
 

How I Will Spend The Money
The goal that we have set is: $13,972.  That includes the following: 

Studio time at the legendary Hilltop Studios in Nashville, TN (infamous studio where legends like Dolly Parton, Alan Jackson, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn and MORE have recorded back in their heydays!)  
Session musician pay
Producer and sound engineer fees
Travel to Nashville (we will have to stay for almost a week to finish the album).
Indiegogo payment processing fees
CD printing
Perks manufacturing and shipping
Songwriter splits / mechanical royalties
Graphics and photography 
Lunch for the band on recording day.  (This may not seem like a necessity, BUT short of doing something CRAZY like robbing a bank or dancing naked around a pole, I'll do whatever I have to do to get these A-lister band members to come back and play on my record. Haha!) According to EVERYONE who is ANYONE in Nashville, that's how it used to be done in the good old days before LA took over.  Since my mission is to bring old country back in style, why not treat the band the way they used to be treated when Nashville was still Nashville? These guys are legends, and they deserve to be treated as such.  So if a couple hundred dollars to cater lunch in is what makes them happy, then I am gonna make that happen if I can! 

 
If we happen to overfund (Lord, Jesus please let us overfund), I will put that money toward a publicist, album release party, digital marketing campaign, a tour manager, and a booking agent. What good will it do to have this PHENOMENAL REAL COUNTRY ALBUM if no one hears it???  My ultimate goal is to go on tour, promote this album, and meet some of my fans in person!

OTHER WAYS TO HELP

Subscribe to be a monthly supporter of Matt Herren Music for only $4.99 per month (on Facebook), and get a lot of cool behind-the-scenes videos and photos of the making of my music and me hanging out with my family and friends.  This is like Matt and Heather reality TV.  It's raw, real, and unedited footage of our daily lives.  You also get first access to new music that I write as well as special offers and discounts ONLY offered to monthly supporters.  
Re-contribute.  You can use the campaign to buy early Christmas presents for family and friends, donate a physical CD to a fan in need, or just plain donate some extra money to my campaign even after you have gotten the perks that you want.  You can re-contribute as much as you want without limit. 

 
Even if you can't afford to contribute money, there are some other ways that you can contribute and REALLY help!!!  

Please shout from the rooftop to all your friends and family who LOVE traditional country music !!!!  Share this campaign EVERYWHERE and OFTEN!  Tell everyone you know that I am trying my hardest to bring traditional country music back! 
Use the Indiegogo share tools!  
Pray for the campaign's success!  
Post a comment here on the campaign page and tell everyone what you HONESTLY think about my music.  I love feedback (good or bad), and I think other people love to hear honest feedback, as well.  
Every dollar, every comment, every share, and every prayer helps! 

 
 
 
 
EVERYONE GETS THE MUSIC!!!!!!
 
The last time I ran a crowdfunding campaign, I had a digital CD download code as an option.  It went over well, but some people were confused about when they were getting a digital download and when they were getting a physical CD.  
Also, I noticed that some of my fans could only afford a certain amount, and they really wanted to help.  So they bought the most expensive perk that they could afford, which may have left them without the ability to also get the music.  For example, they purchased a limited edition tee (because it cost more and they felt like they were contributing more), but then they couldn't afford to buy the music.  
I also had some fans that couldn't afford more than a couple dollars.  They contributed what they could, but they couldn't afford even the digital CD.  
What I have learned over this last year is that ALL people go through hard times, and country music fans turn to the music for therapy.  I want to make sure that everyone has access to this music -even if they are on a fixed income and can only afford a couple dollars.  So, EVERYONE who contributes to my campaign, even if it is only $3 to get your name on the website, will get a FREE download code for the FULL ALBUM!  
You heard that correctly: THE ENTIRE ALBUM!!!!  I don't want anyone to miss out on experiencing this music because I am SO proud of it!  If you are grieving, you NEED to hear Gone.  That song is so therapeutic.  I really think it will help everyone! 
If you are needing an upbeat song to forget your troubles, My Life's A Country Song, is perfect! If you love traditional country, you just can't hear that song and not want to sing along and tap your foot or get up and dance.   
For these reasons, I just feel in my gut that everyone should get to hear the music.  
If you buy the ULTIMATE FAN PACK or a higher priced perk, you will get your code one week early - before everyone else does.  
 
 
REWARD FOR CONTRIBUTING EARLY
 
I like to pay it back and reward people who are the first to help me out.  
So, if you contribute ANYTHING (even $3) in the first 72 hours (Thursday, June 3rd, Friday June 4th, or Saturday, June 5th 2021), I will send you a FREE American Dream (the single) ringtone as soon as the campaign ends.  This ringtone won't be available for download at any other time.  This is the ONLY way to get this ringtone.  
But wait . . . there's MORE!  
In addition, you will also receive two FREE entries into a raffle for a ton of giveaways that we are doing in the middle of this campaign with hand-crafted one-of-a-kind merchandise that will NEVER be available for sale.  You'll be able to purchase more entries into this raffle, but you will get two FREE entries just for contributing in the first 72 hours! 
 
WAIT!  There's EVEN MORE . . . . 
In addition, you'll also get an acoustic, stripped down version of my song What Country Is To Me - the first song my wife, Heather, and I ever wrote together.  This song will be on the album, fully produced with a 7-piece band.  However, while you're waiting on the album to be finished and the perks to be shipped, you'll get this acoustic recording to tide you over.  
 
*The ringtone and acoustic download will be emailed soon after the campaign ends and the contributions are locked.
 

Handcrafted, one-of-a-kind, autographed tumblers donated for the raffle by Tumbling Creations. 
 
Some of the items we will be raffling off are:

Custom American Dream and Matt Herren tumblers, handcrafted by Tumbling Creations (owner Jasca is a Matt Pack Member) and also autographed by me.  Each item is sealed in resin, so my autograph will not wear off.  Jasca's handcrafted designs usually retail for $35 to $50+ in value (without my autograph). 
Custom jewelry and keychains handcrafted by ReGal Creations (owner Loreli is a Matt Pack member). Some items include a male necklace with the Matt Pack wolf head mascot and a female necklace with pictures of Matt Herren.  They contain round bezels and all components are stainless steel.  The charms are Tibetan silver.  The cording and tassels are leather.  Some of the decorative bezels and clips are cast in zinc alloy.  These items range in retail value from $15 to $50 each.  
$150 gift certificate to Backwoods Recording Studio in Nashville, TN (where I recorded my first EP, Made For Me) courtesy of my producer, Tony Ray Jones, and his wife Patty Jones.   It is good for up to 3 hours of studio time.  You can use it for recording a single or couple songs.  It's also great if you wanted to record a karaoke CD for family or friends.   
A 1-hour private chat with me (and my wife Heather if you also want to chat with her) - a $99 value - paid for and donated by Denise Reim (A Matt Pack member).  If you buy the Chat as a perk and you win this, you can get a private, virtual concert or a two-hour chat. Chat must be used within the first 90 days. 
A surprise Matt Pack item valued at over $150 paid for and donated by Becky Andree (A Matt Pack Member). 
And anything else that a fan may offer to make or donate between now and then.  I will autograph everything that I possibly can! Every handcrafted item that will be raffled off will be custom and one-of-a-kind.  They cannot be purchased anywhere else -ever! 

 

Handcrafted, one-of-a-kind, jewelry donated for the raffle by ReGal Creations. 
 
 
*If these items don't entice you, I am also auctioning off my second guitar (George), to the highest bidder.   (I will autograph it live during the auction).   There will be a secret reserve to be met. 
 

 
Shipping and Pricing
Shipping anywhere in the US is included in these perks prices, and we made it as affordable as we could for countries outside of the US.  We also had to build in profit to have the money to finish making the music.  So PLEASE keep that in mind when reviewing the prices.  We tried to keep everything as affordable as possible and build in as much value as possible.  However, at the end of the day, the point is to make a profit so we can make some GREET music!  So these perks are fundraiser-item priced. 
 
What Happens If I Don't Reach The Goal
If we don't reach this goal, we can't make this album quickly.  Plain and simple.  I am asking for the MINIMUM amount needed to finish off this album and fulfill these perks.  I can't cut any corners without sacrificing the quality of the music, so there is no way to do it any cheaper.  SO, if I don't make the goal, the money will be kept in our account until we can save or raise the remainder needed to complete the project and fulfill the perks.  I WILL finish recording this album.  When I am able to do it will depend on how much money I raise during this campaign.  (I don't want you skipping a rent payment or letting your dogs starve, but aside from that, your money is SO important and appreciated NOW more than I could ever describe in words.)  

 
TRUST
I know sometimes it's hard to trust people on crowdfunding sites - especially if it is someone you have no relationship with or have never met in person.  I get that. I want to reassure you that you WILL get your perks!  I may be just a simple, country boy from Arkansas with not much to my name, but the one thing I have is integrity.  My word is my bond.  If I tell you I am gonna do something, then I do it.  I can't promise much, but I can promise that you can trust me.  
AND, I can promise that you'll LOVE this album if you love REAL country music reminiscent of 90's style country like Alan Jackson and George Strait.   I live to make fans happy, and that is all I am trying to do here with the music and the perks.  
Just to ease your mind . . .Here are some quotes and pics from the first crowdfunding campaign that I did when I raised money for an EP.  (Mind you, this wasn't the same quality music as I am going to be putting out this time.  I didn't have a live band).  I didn't raise enough money to make music to the quality that I wanted to.  However, I promised that I would make a CD to the highest quality of music that I could with the money raised.  I set out to make my fans a CD because they were asking for it, and I delivered one as promised.  
 


 
Matt Pack Cares!
Here's one final incentive for you to partner with me on completing this album.  I love to give back, and my fans (The Matt Pack) do, too!  As a promise to my entire existing fan group (and any new fans I may acquire during this process), if we reach the entire funding goal, I will donate 150 digital download codes for the entire album to anyone who is currently or has formerly served in the military.  I believe we, as a society, owe them so much more, but this is what we can collectively do to thank them for their sacrifices.  
 

 
 
I will ALSO donate 150 codes to current cancer patients or their family members.  As a former cancer patient with childhood leukemia, I know the stress and toll that illness can take on a family. Music (especially: traditional country music) was the only escape that I had during those trying times.  If I can offer that same kind of escape and coping mechanism, then I am honored to be in a position to be able to do that.  

Matt Herren listening to country music at St. Jude Research Hospital in 1997.

Finally, I want to thank everyone who has been following my journey and listening to my music, so far.  I owe every ounce of success that I have had to God, my supportive family,  my producer, Tony Ray, and especially my amazing fanbase, The Matt Pack!  Without all of ya'll, I wouldn't be where I am right now.  You have shown me that together, we can move mountains!  
 
So if you are as excited as I am about this new album, what are  you waiting for?  Contribute NOW.  Get your desired perks before they're all gone!  We have limited quantities on many of the items so that we can control the manufacturing costs.  Contribute early so that you can get all of the early-bird rewards, and don't miss out on limited quantities!

<p>The Bay Area Jazz Composers Book brings together musical works from 75 California Bay Area composers. A long overdue collection documenting one of the country’s most thriving jazz and improvised music scenes, the volume’s 124 compositions showcase a startlingly rich array of musical styles. Swing, hard bop, avant-garde, Brazilian, and free jazz comfortably co-exist—each piece an idiosyncratic voice within a multigenerational collective. Featuring a foreword from longtime Bay Area music journalist Andrew Gilbert alongside black-and-white photographs of the composers, this publication deserves a place on musicians’ shelves and bandstands.</p>
<p>Copies of the BAJCB will be donated to public school music programs, conservatories, and musicians in and with connections to the Bay Area. An invaluable teaching aid, the book will offer inspiration to aspiring musicians while fostering tangible connections among local students, teachers, and cultural workers. As music venues reopen their doors and live music returns, the book will serve as a resource to encourage collaboration between musicians in the Bay Area and beyond.</p>
<p>This publication is just one effort to recognize the vibrant, creative music scene born of the community.</p>
<p>We're asking for $5,500 to cover printing and shipping costs for 300 books and designer fees. Thank you for your generous support of Bay Area music.</p>

<p>I want it to be clear that <i><strong>EVERY PENNY received from this campaign is going into making the coolest, highest quality records possible.</strong></i> If there's extra money, it will be put into making the records even sweeter by doing things like adding custom inserts, photo booklets and beyond.

<h3>About Me</h3>

</div></div>","Hi! I’m Annie, and I’m an independent singer/songwriter from upstate NY. I pursue music because I love it, but recording and releasing music is a very expensive process. My debut album, Garden Bed, was just released, and I am hoping to raise enough money to cover merch, physical copies, mixing/mastering services, copyright registration, and PR. Anything you can give is greatly appreciated!
 
Why Contribute?
For those of you who are unfamiliar with the music industry, record labels supply their artists with the resources to produce an album. As an independent artist, I am responsible for funding all of the above on my own. I hope to raise enough money to cover the high costs that go into producing a record.
 
What You'll Get
Here are some of the perks you could receive!

Signed CD
Signed Vinyl

Garden Bed T-shirt
Long Sleeve Shirt
Limited Edition Debut EP
Handwritten Lyric Sheets of your choice

Garden Bed Stickers

<h3>You can be part of new art</h3>
<p>After seven years of touring across Canada and the United States, I took some time off in late 2019/early 2020 to reset, reflect, and recover from the chaos of being on the road. In those winter months, I wrote most of the songs that have gone on to become my fifth full-length album.<strong> These are introspective, personal songs, bold and honest, raw and vulnerable.</strong></p>
<p>I had no idea that we'd all be spending our days at home just a few months later, looking for connection, wrestling with our quiet thoughts that suddenly became loud in the absence of activity.<br/><br/>I had one main goal for this album - <strong>Make something beautiful.</strong><br/><br/>I wanted to showcase these songs in lush, gorgeous soundscapes. <strong>Songs that call out in moments of fear, anxiety, and loneliness. And songs of celebration, hope, healing, and renewal.</strong> The gold in the grey.<br/><br/><strong>Don't have a CD player anymore?</strong> In addition to CDs and digital tracks, this album will also be released in a <u><strong>postcard format</strong></u>.<br/><br/>I created an 11x14-inch acrylic-on-canvas painting inspired by each song on the album and one that will be featured as the album cover art. Images of these paintings will be made into postcards (each with a download code for the song or album included).<br/><br/>So much of the writing and production process for this album felt...painterly...where songs and sonic landscapes came together first as washes of colour, melodies and poetry, musical brushstrokes, gradually detailed and refined. It felt natural to continue that conversation on canvas. <strong>And you'll get a little bit of original art to go along with the music.</strong></p>

(I'm not sure, to be honest, that it's a good goal in the first place.)  But this album is different, because we're no longer under contract. So we're asking our friends and allies to help us make it. We're trying to raise at least $50k to write, record, mix, master, press, design, distribute, and publicize a new full-length Shearwater album, for release in late 2020—an effort that will take months of work by many people. Record-making costs less than it once did; but to create an LP that meets the standards of our best work, this is the minimum we need. It would let us work with our friends and heroes, and grant us the most important freedom of all: the freedom to make missteps, and correct them.If we can raise more than this, the quality of the record will improve, and new sonic adventures will be possible. (For an idea of what this means, scroll down to the bottom of this page, where we've used our crystal ball to predict the album's reviews based on its budget.)But above all:Thank you for reading, listening, and being here. —JM/SW Perks we're offering to encourage your support:[Note: if these numbers seem steep, bear in mind that this isn't an album pre-sale; it's a fundraising effort to make the album in the first place.  If we can raise enough to make it, there'll be a more traditional pre-sale later on.] $25 - Incorporeal Music - a 24-bit, lossless digital download of the new album before its physical release in late 2020, made available to you before anyone else. (Image by Kahn and Selesnick, from City of Salt.)$50 - Incorporeal Music, Metaphysical Artifact - a digital download of the new album, plus access to an exclusive Instagram page documenting the making of the record in late 2019-early 2020.$75 - Ones and Zeroes Complete - all above, plus access to a personal video diary by JM from the new album sessions.$100 - Indelible Artifact (CD/Vinyl LP) - all digital incentives above, plus a signed CD or vinyl LP  of the new album (your choice). $150 - ""Drowning World"" Poker Deck - all digital incentives above, plus Kahn and Selesnick's beautiful, limited-edition panoramic poker deck, which inspired their album cover for Rook.  This is no ordinary deck; each suit can be laid end-to-end to form a panorama of K&S's whimsical vision of a world under water.  $200 - Jet Plane & Oxbow: First Edition LP - all incentives above (ie. all except the K&S poker deck), plus one of the last few copies of the limited first run ""Loser"" Edition of Jet Plane & Oxbow on beautiful colored vinyl.

(See the FAQ for more details.) Last but not least: fake (but likely) reviews for a new SW album, by budget: $10k -  ""Meiburg & Co. sound frantic and disorganized, as if everything was done in a great hurry.""$20k - ""A serviceable Shearwater record is welcome enough, as far as that goes; but does anyone really need it?""$25k - ""Once again, Shearwater's reach exceeds their grasp.  You can hear them straining to pull off something grand and remarkable, but it never takes flight.""$30k - ""There are glorious ingredients in this album, but they often fail to cohere; as if too many big decisions were made at the last minute. You wonder what might have happened if they'd been able to take it further."" $35k- ""Shearwater sound as if they forgot to step back and consider what they were making, until it was too late.""$50k - ""The album bears the marks of work and risk, of time and care, of surfaces buffed to a high gloss, considered, and joyfully roughed up again. Absorbing, fascinating, powerful."" $75k - ""Achieves a depth and breadth of sound (and vision) very rare in pop music these days.""$100k - ""Shearwater were always a promising band, one that seemed as if they were about to do something extraordinary.  Friends, this is that album.""  $150k - ""Some bands treat orchestral textures as a crutch, or ponderous filigree, but Shearwater make them an integral part of this singular album"".$200k - ""The grand gestures finally connect.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Shelterheart was born out of Christ-centered community. The songs bear testimony to God's work in my life through His Church, and especially through a few of my closest friends in a particularly trying season. I didn't dream of these songs being recorded so soon until September 2020 when I connected with the talented Asher Peterson out in Nashville. I was so blown away by his project NAMO as well as his work with his siblings Aedan and Skye in Wake Low that I made quick haste (quicker than your usual haste) to connect through email. We connected via phone and set up studio time set in Nashville with him as producer. <br/><br/>(<i>It's worth mentioning that Asher is the son of a guy named Andrew Peterson, who you probably know a little about if you know me well, as I talk incessantly about the impact of Andrew's music on both my art and in my walk with Christ</i>.)<br/><br/>With Asher at the helm (and some extra help from my longtime collaborator and full-time friend Allen Odell), I believe these songs have the potential to encourage a lot of people. My greatest desire is to serve you with them and help you realize you're not alone in your hurt, nor should you be alone. I hope these songs move your heart to lean into both the heart of Jesus and into the hearts of those who lean into the heart of Jesus. Don't believe the hype. All is not relational desolation in this post-COVID world, circa 2021. I hope this record can bear witness to that and prime your heart for the Better Country on the road we were made to walk together. <br/><br/>When I think of this record, I don't think about an art project. I just think about my friends.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Of course, this brings me to why I'm starting a campaign. To make the best record I can possibly make, it requires a little thing called money, which is a little thing I'm personally short on. Asher and I have talked figures and he's given me a generous offer of <strong><u>$6,000</u></strong> (far lower than the average price for a record of this magnitude) to mix and master the record for the entirety of August. This feels like a lot to ask for, as I've never asked anyone for money apart from family and close friends, but I believe that the perks of contributing will be more than worth it for you. Among other perks, you'll receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>The full 15-song album when it releases (approx. Nov. 2021) </li>
<li>An exclusive, stripped-down 8-song companion EP of entirely new songs included with the November album release before it goes to streaming platforms next year (approx. Nov. 2021)</li>
<li>A deluxe edition including two B-sides, two demos, two covers, and two alternate versions of previously released tracks (est. Nov. 2021)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>The goals of this record are threefold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, <strong><i>to create a dynamic, yet cohesive album listening experience that's fresh and unique</i></strong>... I believe this entire volume of songs to be the strongest I've written in my short career and that it communicates my heart as well as anything I could make... My hope for this record is that 20 years down the line, if the Lord extends both my years and my career, listeners will point newcomers to this record as the best place to start.</li>
<li>Secondly, and most importantly, <i><strong>to encourage the listener with the hope of the Gospel, specifically as it relates to Christ-centered community</strong></i>... This album is full of personal stories of friendship that I hope can be a counterpoint in this age of social media chaos and COVID-wrought isolation... I pray you can find yourself in these stories and be moved to run into the arms of the Savior Who lives to be with you at your most alone. And I pray you find yourself some comrades on this wartime side of eternity. </li>
<li>Finally, <i><strong>to ultimately build a bigger platform (if even slightly) to better champion other indie artists and friends who are trying to bless as many people with their music as possible</strong></i>... If I desire for my voice to be amplified through this record, it's only to amplify the voices of those around me. There is incredible music being made by incredible people that I intend to push as much as (if not more than) my own music. Yes, I want my own music to be heard, but I <i>really</i> want my friends to be heard. If this record can expand my reach so I can pester those new listeners with the incredible work my friends are doing, that would be insane.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially in these crazy times, there are a few other ways to contribute:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Spread the word on this project via social media platforms</i></li>
<li><i>Donate however much or little as you desire... The perks are preset, but you can still donate... If you can't give a dollar, feel free to give a cent...</i></li>
<li><i>Please pray for us as we work on this project, that the Lord would provide what we need to make it, and that He would use the record to grow His people and encourage those who are reeling from the chaos and isolation of the last year... My chief desire is that these songs would provide a shelter for people, true to its name, and make them aware of the presence of Jesus... Pray especially to that aim.</i></li>

People"" (2003) and ""Stop Talking About Comic Books or I'll Kill You"" (1998) appeared on Dr. Demento albums.  My voice is the first thing you hear on the Gym Class Heroes' hit ""Cupid's Chokehold,"" and I co-wrote the theme to Disney's Fillmore.  </p><p>But enough about me.  Let's talk about my quarantine album!  This will be a true solo album, meaning that all the songs were written, produced, and performed by me.  I'm not even using drum loops or programming.  For better or worse, the guitar, bass, and drums were physically played by me.</p><p>The album will be mixed and mastered by Jeff Thomas, whose production work can be heard on Ookla's <i>Oh Okay LA </i>and Via Bella's <i>The Way of Beauty</i>.</p><p>Most of the music for this project was written over the last year, but a lot of the lyrics were written a decade ago as part of the online Instapoem project I did with my friend Debbie Ridpath Ohi.  These poems were conceived and written in under five minutes (inspired by reader-supplied prompts), which explains why they (and the resulting songs) are so short. </p><p>The track listing is still coming together, but it's will definitely have over 40 songs.  Here's a baker's dozen of the song titles:</p><ul>

People"" (2003) and ""Stop Talking About Comic Books or I'll Kill You"" (1998) appeared on Dr. Demento albums.  My voice is the first thing you hear on the Gym Class Heroes' hit ""Cupid's Chokehold,"" and I co-wrote the theme to Disney's Fillmore.  But enough about me.  Let's talk about my quarantine album!  This will be a true solo album, meaning that all the songs were written, produced, and performed by me.  I'm not even using drum loops or programming.  For better or worse, the guitar, bass, and drums were physically played by me.The album will be mixed and mastered by Jeff Thomas, whose production work can be heard on Ookla's Oh Okay LA and Via Bella's The Way of Beauty.Most of the music for this project was written over the last year, but a lot of the lyrics were written a decade ago as part of the online Instapoem project I did with my friend Debbie Ridpath Ohi.  These poems were conceived and written in under five minutes (inspired by reader-supplied prompts), which explains why they (and the resulting songs) are so short. The track listing is still coming together, but it's will definitely have over 40 songs.  Here's a baker's dozen of the song titles:
I Lost a Pun Contest
Jazz Drawers 
The Shining
Unpopular Star Wars Character in an Unsecured Vessel
Our Children Will Abandon Their Bodies
Will Smith
I Don't Know Why: A Short Play for Two Actors (Woman and Fly)
Who Watches the Watchmen Watchmen
FiveFourSeasons
N
Wild Whirled
Uncle Ar
Squirm Dirty Worm
What You GetYou can pre-order the album (digitally or as a physical CD) and you can also support the project by availing yourself of the following perks:
Demos, process tracks, alternate mixes, and other bonus tracks
An eBook containing the lyrics in their original poetic form, along with track-by-track liner notes
Access to a Zoom listening party where you can hear the entire album before it is released and ask me whatever questions you might have about it
Zoom concerts
Your short poem or lyric set to music by me
...and more!What I NeedThis project has already been recorded, which means a.) no budget is needed for recording, and b.) turnaround should be fairly short! Here's the budget:$1,000 -- Mixing$300 -- Mastering$1,500 -- Duplication (compact disc/digipak)$750 -- Graphic Design (CD package and PDF eBook)$350 -- Registration/Distribution/Promotion$100 -- Crowd-Sourcing FeesTotal Goal: $4,000If I exceed the goal, I will create a more elaborate package and expand the promotional campaign, but please know that you will receive the perks you select even if the budget is not met.Other Ways You Can HelpCan't contribute right now?

<h3>Sharing stories through music</h3>
<p>We're proud to present the new look Lights And Lines, a music collective and record label where curation sits at the heart of everything we do. </p>
<p>Members of this group have self-released music, managed bands, booked tours, worked on PR campaigns, written reviews, hosted podcasts, put on gigs, run festivals, and loads more. We've been talking about setting up a label for years and now is the time to seize the moment.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our intention is to share amazing stories through music.</span></p>
<p>Stories have the power to conjure up feelings of hope or despair and choose to bring us light or darkness. They can be based on fiction or fact, some are poignant, some are sad, some are inspiring. Whatever the function or outcome of a story, the idea of narrative is an innate part of what makes us human.</p>
<p>In 2021 we believe that in a world where everything is digital it can be rewarding to have something to hold...</p>
<p>We’re working with artists to offer something tangible and physical to listeners - like CDs, Tapes, and Records. We'll then enhance these with digital assets such as ezines, downloadable artwork and podcasts - creating some truly unique, hybrid listening experiences along the way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need &amp; what you get</h3>
<p>We have a number of releases in the pipeline and we're keen to make an impact straight away. The money raised in this campaign will go towards producing best quality physical releases, and help us amplify our collective voice in more places. In return you've got 3 great options to choose from, and a couple of combinations / variations - we have kept these MEGA simple to start off with but are happy to add more if in demand....</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Option 1: Antisocial Tee.</strong> By popular demand, the joint winner of our design vote a few months back, probably mostly because of the swearing! Buy a tee, support the label, look awesome while you do - job done.</li>
<li>
<strong>Option 2: Collective Tee.</strong> The other joint winner racking up the same percentage of votes was this brilliant Collective definition Tee. We’ve gone so punk with these we didn’t even bother putting our own logo on them so you better wear them and tell people about us!</li>
<li>
<strong>Option 3: The big one.</strong> A very reasonably priced 12 month subscription. If we release a CD, you’ll get one. Cassette Tape, you’ll get it. You get 1 of everything! Plus you get all the digital stuff too! Oh and we’ll throw a tee in!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What's in the pipeline for option 3?</h3>
<p>Based on what we know so far the proposed package includes:<br/> <br/>1 x Tee (Choose from 2 options)<br/>2 x EP (CD)<br/>2 x Albums (CD)<br/>2 x Albums (Cassette)<br/>Download options for all<br/>Sticker &amp; Button Badge</p>
<p>As we get into this we might find we release more, or that the mix changes depending on the artists requirements. Whatever happens we will make sure you get at least your money's worth and no doubt more!!  </p>
<p>Note on Vinyl - although it's unlikely we will pursue this in Year 1,  if Vinyl becomes a viable option it's not currently in scope of this reward due to cost, We'll think of something else amazing when that comes along...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It's the music industry, delays could happen with logistical things like recording or contracts, or on the creative side - bands can split up, inspiration never comes, etc. If the option 3 subscription doesn't meet its value in year 1 for reasons like these that are beyond our control we'll simply extend its length.</p>
<p>T-Shirts have very little risk other than manufacturing delays due to further unplanned COVID shutdowns. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>Hey - not everyone can help with money and that's ok! If you like what we do but can't afford to be involved right now that's ok. If you still want to help out why not share some posts on social media, or tell a friend!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>these are the immediate needs to get this project off the ground and moving forward, in a bare-boned-indie manner.</p>
<p>however... after having made <strong>house music</strong> for <i>20 years</i> now, i genuinely don't know who will want to explore this nostalgic and mostly acoustic journey with me... but while this 'unknown' humbles me already, I am completely committed to the gifts you contribute towards. i love the music and i truly love being able to share it with you. i can't wait to see where this project goes and i'm grateful for the chance to grow in front of you all.</p>
<p>to the friends who gave me the courage to do this, you know who you are.</p>
<p>i love you.</p>

<p>what i've created in this video music sampler, is my most honest offering of what i can do ""on my own"", of course with the help of homies around me (our continual labour-of-love and bartering nature between fellow<i> heartists</i>) it could be lifted further. but with the help of my community - true supporters who have been here for me, some, 5 albums and counting - old friends who make me who i am, some, since ""1990-something!"" - and of course, treasured family (since the day I was born!) - this music could be elevated to its full potential. these covers and songwriters are KING. i want so much to do them j u s t i c e . . .</p>

indiegogo fam, it's been three years since we came together for HEART OF GOLD!
as you know *everyone* who backs this campaign and pre-orders the album will be a part of the thank you/liners on the finished product! 
you. make. this. possible.

 
so! this is album number six (I can hardly believe it!), it's on six strings (I've been so busy learning again!) and as always (this is also campaign no.6!) this is when and where I need your help:
 


if $1000 raised: my first ProTools update in 10yrs!


if $2000 raised: full body guitar, case & customized picks!


if $3000 raised: mechanical licensing for these epic covers!


if $4000 raised: mastering & ultra lim.edition (eco friendly) CD!


if $5000 raised: professionally engineered studio & feature musicians!


if $6000 raised: professional composer & complete string quartet feature!

$6000 USD GOAL INCLUDES: Indiegogo, PayPal and extra postage fees*


 
about this goal...
 
these are the immediate needs to get this project off the ground and moving forward, in a bare-boned-indie manner.
however... after having made house music for 20 years now, i genuinely don't know who will want to explore this nostalgic and mostly acoustic journey with me... but while this 'unknown' humbles me already, I am completely committed to the gifts you contribute towards. i love the music and i truly love being able to share it with you. i can't wait to see where this project goes and i'm grateful for the chance to grow in front of you all.
to the friends who gave me the courage to do this, you know who you are.
i love you.

 
about this music... the long, short...


 

about the album... the long, not short...

 

 
what i've created in this video music sampler, is my most honest offering of what i can do ""on my own"", of course with the help of homies around me (our continual labour-of-love and bartering nature between fellow heartists) it could be lifted further. but with the help of my community - true supporters who have been here for me, some, 5 albums and counting - old friends who make me who i am, some, since ""1990-something!"" - and of course, treasured family (since the day I was born!) - this music could be elevated to its full potential. these covers and songwriters are KING. i want so much to do them j u s t i c e . . .
 

[BLACK DOG STRING QUARTET • Sunrise Studios, Vancouver, BC • HEART OF GOLD, 2017]
. . . which means i also envision the opportunity to work with a professional composer and a full string section again - these songs, the lyrics, the melodies, the artists that i respect so much - they call for that level of musical magic. we've done it before, so i am truly manifesting what may come next if we manage to meet or exceed this initial goal.
 
 
small scream! first single out n o w !
 
New York City's Vibe Boutique Records EP ""DON'T STOP"" is the first single from the album, including an unreleased house remix by N'DINGA GABA (album-exclusive) the original deep house cut by Switzerland's MONODELUXE, and my own acoustic cut: 
 


 

 
the full remix ep, including a floor friendly mix by NYC's Mark Francis, is on TRAXSOURCE xx

you can spread the word and make some noise about this campaign!

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>After a long journey of dipping in and out of music covers and being pushed to hone my musical abilities, I am <strong>finally</strong> taking the first major step onto my path as a musician in tandem with my acting career. This music video for the track <i>Omertà</i> will be my first single and will set the bar for future endeavors and opportunities!  </p>
<p>The video concept for <i>Omertà </i>will not be a traditional music video. We hope to create a trailer-like cut of a film inspired by my Italian heritage and classic mafia movies like The Godfather, to accompany the track. With our budget goal we can take the set back in time to the 1940-60s and visually achieve an aesthetic more reminiscent of a Hollywood film than music video. </p>
<p>I am so unbelievably proud of this song, and although Covid derailed the strategic and organized plans I had for my music journey this year, I am refusing to end this year without hitting my most pivotal goal - which is to release my first single and music video. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Your contribution will allow me and the talented team I have in place to fully realize a vivid concept that will take a village to execute WITHOUT cutting corners. It will allow the incredible friends I have in their respective industries to be paid and given the tools they need to make this project something we are all proud of and for you to enjoy! </span></p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Our end goals is roughly $8,000 but whatever we raise will be applied!</p>
<p>BEFORE YOU FREAK OUT - ""That sounds expensive!"" - if only 320 people donate $25 we already achieve the goal! Not so impossible! Whatever you can contribute will be utilized responsibly. We understand the state of things around the world right now, so even $1 counts!  </p>
<p>As an actor, I have been very lucky to accumulate a wide network of incredible talents in all sorts of industries. From videographers, to visionary directors, to stylists and talented hair and makeup gurus - I want to make this project not only visually stunning, but incorporate as many of these talented artists as I can, AND PAY THEM! </p>
<p>I hope this footage will elevate the song to a level that will leave a lasting impression. This will all come down to having the necessary budget to allocate to all the needs of a project on this scale.</p>
<p>THE MONEY WILL GO TO- Locations, permits, editing, film equipment, insurance, sound, crew members, fees, director, talent, props, styling, makeup, hair, Covid safety measures, and more.</p>
<p>So I know its cringe to crowdfund, but I love artists, my friends and music, and I want to aim big!  </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What You'll Get</h3>
<p>Because this video will be shot more like a film, I would love to include every single name of those who contributed and supported this project in the end credits! Picture a long scrolling screen of credits with all of your names attached to this amazing moment that will forever be ""my first big step in music.""</p>
<p>Not only will your name be stamped on the project as you are truly part of it, but I will send a special photo with a handwritten note with autograph to every email listed in the contributions! Just a small token of gratitude.  </p>
<p>I hope to also invite the contributors to a virtual ZOOM meet up sometime in the launching window of this music video. Imagine a huge meet up via ZOOM where I can speak to you guys more intimately about the projects creation, the plans for it, and updates. When this is organized we can send a follow up to the email you include with your contribution! </p>

The end result will be something I am doing FOR YOU GUYS in hopes of coming out of the gate with a bang, and to make sure future opportunities in music open to me. I want to keep making things for you guys with more resources available to me in the future.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>I'm going back to my roots! After over ten years as the front man for The Unfortunates it is time for me to finally record and release my first solo record since 2008.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Since they were old enough to hold and play instruments, the boys of Leland Blue have pursued a lifelong passion of creating music that continues to push beyond their own boundaries in the hopes of connecting with like-minded people across the globe. With a continuously growing fanbase of 50,000+ monthly listeners on Spotify, this group of twenty-year olds found early encouragement when they released their first single in 2017, “Sofia” which has amassed over 2 million streams.</p>
<p>After two EPs of genre fluid music that continued to develop with every release, the boys of Leland Blue started to gather steam by playing a variety of shows as well as preparing for their biggest project yet. As the global pandemic shook the world at the start of 2020, all of that momentum was brought to an unexpected halt, just as it was for all other artists, workers, and humans alike. While the past year has been one of many hardships, the boys have found ways to persevere, while also continuing to substantially grow musically and keep their eyes on a dream. A dream that has the potential to turn making music from a hobby into a profession, and to ultimately change their lives. </p>
<p>That’s exactly where you come in.</p>
<h2>Where’s Your Money Going?</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the video, there’s many pieces of the puzzle that lead to a professional and collective body of a musical project. It takes writing incredible songs, professional recordings, mixing, mastering, high-quality content to accompany those songs, marketing, advertising, branding, and much more. </p>
<p>With all of those pieces in mind, we’ve set a goal of 10K to fully bring this project to fruition. All of the funds raised from this campaign will go directly back into these categories, which includes but is not limited to:</p>
<p>Studio time (recording, mixing, mastering)</p>
<p>Budgets for creative content (music videos, photoshoots, etc.)</p>
<p>Marketing + Advertising (ads for social media, music blogs, etc.)</p>
<p>Branding (singles and album artwork, logo design, etc.)</p>
<p>All of these pieces play a crucial part in the process of making sure everything feels cohesive and high quality. Cutting a corner anywhere can be detrimental to the project as a whole.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>With the hopeful completion of this campaign, which leads to the completion of this project by hopefully the end of Summer 2021, the plan is to present all of these materials to a label with the intention of getting a record deal. The representation of a label will lead to more contacts, more opportunities, music distribution across the country, better promotion, and ultimately get this music in front of the people who want to see it.</p>
<p>In today’s music industry, labels are much more prone to signing an artist that already has the materials ready at hand. Granted these have to be exceptional materials, and we fully believe that’s the case with this project. </p>
<p>Big dreams are scary. But if they don’t scare you, they aren’t big enough.</p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>There’s many risks and challenges that come with the completion of this goal. There is a lot of pressure to meet deadlines, and we have to rely on other people and sources to help us meet those deadlines. People are not always totally reliable, however, through many years of production experience, in both music and film, we feel completely determined, capable, and ready to navigate these challenges.</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Right now is a tough time for everyone. There’s no denying that. If you’re not able to donate, spreading the word can be just as, or more, effective. A few clicks can go further than you would ever imagine.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support and love.</p>

<p>Happy 2021 CA Army, are you ready for the next chapter?</p>
<p>It’s been a long journey, and we’re finally here. A full album in hand and a vision to share with you. But before we get into that, we want to tell you a bit about how we got here.</p>
<p>It was about two and a half years ago when we started this album. From the very beginning, we’ve always said that if we were going to go for this, we would do it right. Every one of us knew that this had potential. The stars just couldn’t seem to align for us. At some points, it really looked like it was a lost cause.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617736604/plpvldmyp63bxvid2wbv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When the world shut down, we had to take a long look at what’s in front of us. We were under lockdown. That meant no playing side gigs, no going out, no vacations, nothing to distract us or keep us from making this album. At that point, we all got on a video call (the first of many) and said this is it. It's now or never.</p>
<p>These video calls turned into bouncing instrumental ideas back and forth and eventually making so many demos that we couldn’t keep track of them. We spent the whole quarantine writing remotely. Not once did we all get in a room with our instruments and start jamming to come up with ideas. It was all digital back and forth. After we had a good batch of songs we were proud of, we reached out to our long-time collaborator Felix Nieto to get in the studio with him and bring these tracks to life.</p>
<p>Black Sky Sunrise. This title is everything that we wrote into this album. There's so much dichotomy on this record between bright and beautiful and dark and heavy. There was so much grief, confusion, anxiety, depression, and anger in 2020, but amidst all of that we had this record, and we had each other. It felt like even though the future was dark and we had no idea what was going to come of all of it, it was worth putting it all on the line for this. This record was the light that pushed us to stay afloat.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609890791/orkh1q0gixh1o1aoqfaw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We came out of the studio with brand new songs that reflected our feelings not only towards each other but also the world that was quickly changing around us. This record speaks of the times, but it also speaks of grief and loss for what we once had before all of this madness.</p>
<p>We've been keeping you updated on this whole experience the best we can from our homes in quarantine, and you guys have been championing us the entire way through. It's been incredible.</p>
<p>While we've made all this progress, we're still at a major disadvantage. We have all these new songs and ideas for making this album as incredible as possible, but it’s impossible for us to fund this all alone.</p>
<p>The only thing that brought this record together was us banding as a team. Today we want to expand that team. We want to bring you in on this project, get to know all of you better, and thank you for supporting us through all of this chaos. With everything we’ve been through to get here, trust and believe we are serving you absolutely nothing but our best.</p>
<p>We are forever grateful for all of the support we’ve received from our fans since the very beginning. Even when we were on a rocky road, we had so much love coming in from people that kept us together. We know you guys have our backs and we have so much faith in you. </p>
<p>Black Sky Sunrise is coming soon.</p>
<p>Xx</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We intimately understand the financial troubles that people have been going through in the last year, and we completely understand if now is not the best time for you to get involved in a fundraiser like this.

</div></div>","Happy 2021 CA Army, are you ready for the next chapter?
It’s been a long journey, and we’re finally here. A full album in hand and a vision to share with you. But before we get into that, we want to tell you a bit about how we got here.
It was about two and a half years ago when we started this album. From the very beginning, we’ve always said that if we were going to go for this, we would do it right. Every one of us knew that this had potential. The stars just couldn’t seem to align for us. At some points, it really looked like it was a lost cause.

When the world shut down, we had to take a long look at what’s in front of us. We were under lockdown. That meant no playing side gigs, no going out, no vacations, nothing to distract us or keep us from making this album. At that point, we all got on a video call (the first of many) and said this is it. It's now or never.
These video calls turned into bouncing instrumental ideas back and forth and eventually making so many demos that we couldn’t keep track of them. We spent the whole quarantine writing remotely. Not once did we all get in a room with our instruments and start jamming to come up with ideas. It was all digital back and forth. After we had a good batch of songs we were proud of, we reached out to our long-time collaborator Felix Nieto to get in the studio with him and bring these tracks to life.
Black Sky Sunrise. This title is everything that we wrote into this album. There's so much dichotomy on this record between bright and beautiful and dark and heavy. There was so much grief, confusion, anxiety, depression, and anger in 2020, but amidst all of that we had this record, and we had each other. It felt like even though the future was dark and we had no idea what was going to come of all of it, it was worth putting it all on the line for this. This record was the light that pushed us to stay afloat.

We came out of the studio with brand new songs that reflected our feelings not only towards each other but also the world that was quickly changing around us. This record speaks of the times, but it also speaks of grief and loss for what we once had before all of this madness.
We've been keeping you updated on this whole experience the best we can from our homes in quarantine, and you guys have been championing us the entire way through. It's been incredible.
While we've made all this progress, we're still at a major disadvantage. We have all these new songs and ideas for making this album as incredible as possible, but it’s impossible for us to fund this all alone.
The only thing that brought this record together was us banding as a team. Today we want to expand that team. We want to bring you in on this project, get to know all of you better, and thank you for supporting us through all of this chaos. With everything we’ve been through to get here, trust and believe we are serving you absolutely nothing but our best.
We are forever grateful for all of the support we’ve received from our fans since the very beginning. Even when we were on a rocky road, we had so much love coming in from people that kept us together. We know you guys have our backs and we have so much faith in you. 
Black Sky Sunrise is coming soon.
Xx
Marina, Dougie, Nick & Paul

<h3>BIO</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Katie Sachs and I have been a singer-songwriter for over 20 years, with 3 studio albums and 2 official music videos under my belt. I have lived and traveled all over the country, playing songs and collaborating with other independent musicians - primarily in Massachusetts, Austin, TX and Asheville, NC. I am SOO excited to announce that I will be recording a BRAND NEW FULL LENGTH ALBUM this winter called The Factory of Almosts (read more below.) It's been two years since my last release, and five since my last full album, and this collection of songs feels like a true re-emergence - my best work yet. With a background as a community organizer and in the healing arts, I believe that art does not happen alone. I invite you to be a part of the creation of this project, especially during these times that can be so isolating and challenging. Let's make a new record together! </p>

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>The Factory of Almosts is a collection of 11 songs about the end of love, almost loves, not being ready for love, and finding yourself through romantic challenges, vulnerability and heartbreaks. It's taken over 5 years to write, and is finally ready to be born! Pre-production for the album has begun, and the line up of musicians is truly incredible: members of Asheville's premier Indie Rock band - The Get Right Band,  Grammy-nominated bass player Paul Kochanski, the legendary Boston music promoter and musician Tom Bianchi, and more... Now all we need is funding!</p>
<p>The pandemic has hit all of us hard, especially working musicians. The winter already tends to be a slower time of year for touring artist, but this year will be even rougher. Your donations go not only to making the dream of this record a reality, but also to supporting independent artists who have limited income opportunities at this time. Additionally, I plan to re-route funds that I normally would put towards physical CD's into promotion of the record - something I have always struggled with. I want this album to have every opportunity of reaching a wider audience, and plan to hire a publicist - the best way to increase your chances of air play. </p>
<p>As a thank you, there are options for perks at varying contribution price point, though any pledge amount is possible, and rewards are not required if you are just wanting to make a simple donation. Every pledge amount - large or small - is SO appreciated. Thank you for all of your support in making this record happen. </p>
<h2><strong>Budget</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>Making an album is pricey, but very doable. ""The Factory"" will be my 4th studio album, and so I am very familiar with the costs involved and how to budget for and create a successful record that is produced on the cheaper end of things, but still sounds great! My plan for this album is to revert costs that I normally spend on physical printing and graphics to go towards publicity. My dream is to be able to hire a publicist for the album release, which is one of the best ways to increase the listenership of independent music. Here is a look at exactly where your donations will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUSICIANS: $2,000</li>
<li>MIXING AND MASTERING: $2,000</li>
<li>PUBLICITY AND ADVERTISING: $1,000 +</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I recognize that I am asking for money during a year that has been financially challenging for everyone at a time when people are buying gifts for their loved ones for the holidays. Like many things this year, however, the timing of this project is what it is. My hope is that during this time of giving, music appreciators and supporters will find it in their hearts to make a donation of whatever amount is possible or feels comfortable to them. I TRULY believe that music is one of the most healing and powerful forces we have as humans and that this record has the potential to help thousands of people get through difficult times. I know that this year, for me, Fiona Apple's ""Fetch the Bolt Cutters"" was a god sent. I listened to it every day for about two months and it meant so much to me. There have been many albums like this that have touched the deepest parts of my soul, and though I don't presume to have nearly the level of talent as these famous musicians, if this record can do the same thing for even just one other person,  I can think of no greater honor and reward.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Remember: Even a $5 donation can make a HUGE difference in getting an album funded!</li>
<li>Due to the pandemic, this album will be recorded differently than I have done it in the past, with each musician doing their own home recording. Though I will miss the magic of going into the studio and laying down live tracks, there are also advantages to socially distanced recording!  One is that I can work with musicians from all over the country. Another is that there is much more control over each instrument, as folks will be laying down their own tracks individually, rather than at the same time. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I COMPLETELY understand that these are tough times and that not everyone who wants to support the album will be able to make a financial contribution. Have no fear! There are other, equally appreciated ways to help out. Here are just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">SHARE! SHARE! SHARE! Spread the word on social media, tell your friends, etc.</span></li>
<li>Send words of encouragement </li>
<li>Offer relevant time or services/skills for free (i.e. Graphic Design. Writing press releases, Offering services or goods for perk rewards, just to name a few :)</li>
</ul>

<p>Robbie is also making waves in the music industry!  Aside from the Lana Del Rey collaboration people have been buzzing about his own music and singing for years but he's needed to go through his own personal growth before tackling a solo album.</p>
<p>He's now in a position to go for it and feels like he is surrounded by a powerful community of support and inspiration!</p>
<h4>The plan is to release the single and the video in November, build hype, continue recording, release the album in February 2015 along with some more videos and then hit the festival circuit hard next summer.</h4>

<p>Indiegogo is cool because we will have access to anything that is donated to us regardless of whether we make 100% of our goal or not.*<br/></p>

""Who is robbie FITZSIMMONS?""

Robbie is a professional composer, performer and producer whose extensive musical history has landed him as a cowriter on Lana Del Rey's latest album, Ultraviolence, on stages at The Glastonbury and Electric Forest Festivals, recording at Jackson Browne's studio, Groovemasters (where Bob Dylan recorded his last two albums), and one on one collaboration time with Paul Simon.
He now feels he is ready to record his own material as a full length album!The first single off the album, ""The Worst is Over,"" is in its final stages of production and an elaborate single shot music video is in pre production.Your contribution will go towards production costs of both the video and the album as well as production value for future live shows,which look a little something like this:
    ""Where exactly will my donation go?"" We're honored to be pulling tons of favors from our ridiculously talented community of friends and family who are involved in music and video production on all fronts, BUT we do need financial help with:::: 
Studio time, mixing, mastering and printing of the single and album
Location, equipment and prop rentals for the video

Permits and Insurance costs
Set fabrication and decoration Catering to keep the cast and crew satiated
Travel expenses
Production value for the video, the album and the live show!!!
 



""Do I get anything for donating?""Your donations will not go unnoticed!  We are very grateful to have your support and for this we have offered a number of incentives to entice you, including:::

Cameos in a video
Personalized lessons and concerts
All access VIP packages to fesitvals
Personalized songs
Co-ownership of songs


  ""Why should I support Robbie?"" Robbie is wrangling together some of the greatest talent in the world to participate in this music video and future performances.  These include dancers, fire spinners, aerialists, clowns and mermaids.
Robbie is also making waves in the music industry!  Aside from the Lana Del Rey collaboration people have been buzzing about his own music and singing for years but he's needed to go through his own personal growth before tackling a solo album.
He's now in a position to go for it and feels like he is surrounded by a powerful community of support and inspiration!
The plan is to release the single and the video in November, build hype, continue recording, release the album in February 2015 along with some more videos and then hit the festival circuit hard next summer.
You have the opportunity to be a part of this adventure at the ground level!

  ""What happens if he doesn't make his goal?""   Everything will still happen but on a smaller level.  
We're looking for top notch production value because the art deserves it.
If we make our goal we will be up to speed with the big names out there and we'll be able to keep everything independent in order to preserve artistic integrity!
Indiegogo is cool because we will have access to anything that is donated to us regardless of whether we make 100% of our goal or not.*
*If we make our $15, 000 goal, Indiegogo takes 4%. If we don't make our goal, they take 9% of whatever is donated and give us the rest.



  ""I don't have any money to donate but I want to help!  Is there anything else I can do?""
Thank you!  We're honored to have your support!  Here are some ideas:

Please spread the word to those you think might be interested!

Can you give Robbie a place to sleep if he is touring through your town?

Do you know people who might be interested in helping financially? Are you a good cook? ;)


 There's all sorts of ways you can contribute to the project and we're certainly open to suggestions!:::MUSIC VIDEO PROGRESS:::

We've raised enough to start getting location permits and rentals underway!THANK YOU!!!The video is set to film on October 11th and 13th.  The first day will be at a warehouse location near downtown LA and the second day will be at the Vasquez Rocks outside of Santa Clarita.

<h3>WHAT IS UP?!</h3>
<p>For those that don't know me, I'm a musician/visual artist under the semi-pseudonym <strong>King Dylan</strong>. I've been making music for a good chunk of my life and have been able to do some pretty neat things with this career of sorts.  In 2019, thanks to support from people like you, I was able to fund my first ever Vinyl record and it went pretty well as everyone seemed to be really happy with what they received.  So I would like to do another Vinyl, but with my NEW album - 11 new songs, new videos, and with this Vinyl pressing I'm hoping to offer something different and unique - limited edition ""Mystery Vinyl"" which means the colour of each individual record will be a surprise.  Could be red, could be blue with white marble, could be black, or even clear!  So the record you get will be one of very limited editions!  I also have some fun ideas for perks...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need + What YOU Get</h3>
<p>Here's the details, homies.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to raise <strong>$2800</strong> to put towards the manufacturing of <i>100 Vinyl</i> copies of myNEW album that isn't out yet.  This is basically <i>just below</i> the exact cost of the pressing (~$2730+GST).  I was going to set it higher but I'm actually hoping to <i>surpass</i> that goal because <u>Indiegogo</u> takes their cut (9% if I don't reach my goal - and 5% if I do reach it) so along with shipping and handling costs (variable depending on who donates), I feel like it's fair that I take a few risks myself.  The money I've spent on Mastering, etc. the time I've put into the album and upcoming videos, are all a part of my investment into the music that I believe in.  Which I COULD just put online.  But I want to do Vinyl, and that gets pretty expensive up front.</p>
<p>So think of it like a guaranteed Pre-Sale, with options for additional perks that I wouldn't normally offer EVER.  </p>
<p>EVERY contributor will receive a <strong>Thank You</strong> in the liner insert by name.  If you haven't watched the video, one of the perks you can choose that I'm <i>REALLY excited</i> about is writing a creative, personalized song - that YOU help me write by using a ""Madlib"" (remember Madlibs?) style form where you give me ~10-15 random words to use and I have to use them in the lyrics.  If I get enough donors for this, I might even release them as a fun album online! </p>
<p>There are other options, like a ""Toast or Roast"" (all in good fun) where I can either write a track about how cool and funny and good-looking you are, <strong>OR</strong> I can write a track about how much of a dingus with stupid hair you are.  Your choice.  (ever seen the Roasts on Comedy Central?)  A sense of humour is a must!  But if you're not feeling that, don't select it!  </p>
<p>I want to do some more paintings, so there will be a perk that includes the new album and a custom, unique painting (just for you!), similar to the option I had for the previous album.</p>
<p>If you're feeling like money's tight and you still want to support, there are other options for you too!  But plenty of options if you're feelin saucy.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact On This Project</h3>
<p>Without people like you, independent artists like me would be subject to the likes of Spotify and YouTube, making a few bucks from years of hard work and creative pressure.  With physical products like Vinyl, it actually allows a musician to find real and tangible value in their work, rather than just a ""thumbs up"", or a ""scroll-past"".  We can hold it in our hands and know that this exists and was created by someone with a purpose.</p>
<p>I make music because I enjoy doing it, and I believe that your support means you believe that I can keep producing music that is enjoyable, or at least from the heart, and took a lot of work to achieve.  Not only will you be supporting me, but an industry that is constantly being devalued day by day.  Everybody consumes Art daily, and only a handful of people like yourselves actually stop to appreciate it.</p>
<p>The fact that you've read this far speaks volumes and I am forever grateful.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges<strong> </strong>
</h3>
</div><div>
<p>My ideal situation would be not having to ask you all for your help.  But then I wouldn't be offering these amazing perks over here!  Part of the challenge might be finding the time to write all these potential songs and hoping I can do you all justice, but I will get er done!  One of the risks I am taking is that I am going forward with the Vinyl pressing regardless.  It takes around 12-16 weeks to get the albums pressed and that is just.... phew... I'll be old and grey by then!   (psst, I already am) . So I have to get things rolling.</p>
<p>The best part about Indiegogo is that even if I don't reach the goal, YOU still get the Vinyl, and I still get a portion of the contributions.</p>
<p>But actual risks?  Let's be real. I mean I'm not going to lose my home or anything.  I'm privileged to be in the situation where I ONLY have to ask you to help with the cost of Vinyl.  I'm grateful that I am still able to make music and I couldn't ask for better people on my side.  But as with any investment, it's nice to have a guarantee.  And I believe what I'm doing will be worthwhile to you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, if this project isn't for you but you're thinking ""Hey, well, that Dylan, he's alright!"" then save your hard-earned money and just do me a simple favour by sharing this campaign on your Facebook, Twitter, or online somewhere. If you know a Vinyl junkie that might be interested, send them the link, share the video, whichever works best.  Everything helps.</p>

I've been making music for a good chunk of my life and have been able to do some pretty neat things with this career of sorts.  In 2019, thanks to support from people like you, I was able to fund my first ever Vinyl record and it went pretty well as everyone seemed to be really happy with what they received.  So I would like to do another Vinyl, but with my NEW album - 11 new songs, new videos, and with this Vinyl pressing I'm hoping to offer something different and unique - limited edition ""Mystery Vinyl"" which means the colour of each individual record will be a surprise.  Could be red, could be blue with white marble, could be black, or even clear!  So the record you get will be one of very limited editions!  I also have some fun ideas for perks...

What I Need + What YOU Get
Here's the details, homies.
I'm hoping to raise $2800 to put towards the manufacturing of 100 Vinyl copies of myNEW album that isn't out yet.  This is basically just below the exact cost of the pressing (~$2730+GST).  I was going to set it higher but I'm actually hoping to surpass that goal because Indiegogo takes their cut (9% if I don't reach my goal - and 5% if I do reach it) so along with shipping and handling costs (variable depending on who donates), I feel like it's fair that I take a few risks myself.  The money I've spent on Mastering, etc. the time I've put into the album and upcoming videos, are all a part of my investment into the music that I believe in.  Which I COULD just put online.  But I want to do Vinyl, and that gets pretty expensive up front.
So think of it like a guaranteed Pre-Sale, with options for additional perks that I wouldn't normally offer EVER.  
EVERY contributor will receive a Thank You in the liner insert by name.  If you haven't watched the video, one of the perks you can choose that I'm REALLY excited about is writing a creative, personalized song - that YOU help me write by using a ""Madlib"" (remember Madlibs?) style form where you give me ~10-15 random words to use and I have to use them in the lyrics.  If I get enough donors for this, I might even release them as a fun album online! 
There are other options, like a ""Toast or Roast"" (all in good fun) where I can either write a track about how cool and funny and good-looking you are, OR I can write a track about how much of a dingus with stupid hair you are.  Your choice.  (ever seen the Roasts on Comedy Central?)  A sense of humour is a must!  But if you're not feeling that, don't select it!  
I want to do some more paintings, so there will be a perk that includes the new album and a custom, unique painting (just for you!), similar to the option I had for the previous album.
If you're feeling like money's tight and you still want to support, there are other options for you too!  But plenty of options if you're feelin saucy. 

Your Impact On This Project
Without people like you, independent artists like me would be subject to the likes of Spotify and YouTube, making a few bucks from years of hard work and creative pressure.  With physical products like Vinyl, it actually allows a musician to find real and tangible value in their work, rather than just a ""thumbs up"", or a ""scroll-past"".  We can hold it in our hands and know that this exists and was created by someone with a purpose.
I make music because I enjoy doing it, and I believe that your support means you believe that I can keep producing music that is enjoyable, or at least from the heart, and took a lot of work to achieve.  Not only will you be supporting me, but an industry that is constantly being devalued day by day.  Everybody consumes Art daily, and only a handful of people like yourselves actually stop to appreciate it.
The fact that you've read this far speaks volumes and I am forever grateful.
Risks & Challenges 


My ideal situation would be not having to ask you all for your help.  But then I wouldn't be offering these amazing perks over here!  Part of the challenge might be finding the time to write all these potential songs and hoping I can do you all justice, but I will get er done!  One of the risks I am taking is that I am going forward with the Vinyl pressing regardless.  It takes around 12-16 weeks to get the albums pressed and that is just.... phew... I'll be old and grey by then!   (psst, I already am) . So I have to get things rolling.
The best part about Indiegogo is that even if I don't reach the goal, YOU still get the Vinyl, and I still get a portion of the contributions.
But actual risks?  Let's be real. I mean I'm not going to lose my home or anything.  I'm privileged to be in the situation where I ONLY have to ask you to help with the cost of Vinyl.  I'm grateful that I am still able to make music and I couldn't ask for better people on my side.  But as with any investment, it's nice to have a guarantee.  And I believe what I'm doing will be worthwhile to you.

Other Ways You Can Help
At the end of the day, if this project isn't for you but you're thinking ""Hey, well, that Dylan, he's alright!"" then save your hard-earned money and just do me a simple favour by sharing this campaign on your Facebook, Twitter, or online somewhere. If you know a Vinyl junkie that might be interested, send them the link, share the video, whichever works best.  Everything helps.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This album is the culmination of 5 years of work beginning in New York City, continuing to Cooperstown, NY and ending in Gulfport, Florida. It contains some of the best songs I have written, great musicians on the tracks and songs mastered at Abbey Road Studio in London.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's what it will take for me to release this album to the world:</p>
<ul>
<li>I still have tracks unfinished and I need to hire musicians to add their musical skills to the performances of the gifted musicians already recorded. I still need to master half of the songs on the album and that is a very important link in the production chain. Five songs need to be submitted for copyright, and I'm hoping to make a music video for at least two of the songs.</li>
<li>You don't have to choose a perk, if you only want to donate, that's fine. If you would like a perk in return for your donation I have a range of options. You can get a CD, flash drive or poster of the album cover at every level. Play the guitar? you can get one or two personal guitars lessons, one-on-one with Roger. Want to hang out and hear some great stories about the good old days? Get dinner for two or for four with Roger at Pia's in Gulfport (or we could arrange for somewhere else if you so desire). Want your name as Executive Producer on the best album I've ever done? There's room for 5 people to be on the cover credited as Executive Producer. Would you like for Roger to come to you and play a house concert? That can happen within a 50-mile radius of Gulfport for a nominal contribution.</li>
<li>All money will go to fund the production of this album regardless of whether I meet the goal or not. If I do not reach my goal, I'll sell my other gold and platinum albums to Kelly Kincaide Richardson. (just kidding)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This will make a big difference in bringing the project to fruition:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is my first album in 10 years and, who knows, could be the last.</li>
<li>This will be my sixth album. I've played on 3 platinum albums and had music in films both big and small and all because I've been writing and playing non stop over a long career. This is the next step in a long journey.</li>
<li>You can be a part of my musical legacy and part of my musical history.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I'm pretty close to completing this album. If I make my goal, or exceed it, the album should be ready by the summer. If I do not, the album will still be released, just on a longer timeline. I will honor all the perks in a timely manner,</p>
<ul><li>I've run projects on shoestring budgets for many years and I know how to bring a project to a successful conclusion.</li></ul>

If not for the COVID-19 pandemic, this list would also have included 2020-2021 productions with Staatskapelle Dresden and Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, which will hopefully be postponed.He studied historical keyboards with Paul Clement, Ewald Demeyere, Piet Kuijken, Gustav Leonhardt and Christophe Rousset; conducting through studies with Geert Hendrix and Luc Anthonis and masterclasses with Georg Grün, Daan Admiraal and through many assistantships. He obtained with stellar marks the Master degrees in both harpsichord and conducting at the Royal Conservatoire of Antwerp, where he started teaching already during his final study year. Korneel made his international début at the age of 19 as a continuo player with Sigiswald Kuijken's La Petite Bande, was named 'Young Musician of the Year' in 2014 by the Belgian Music Press Association, and two years later was appointed the new Professor of Harpsichord at the Royal Conservatoire of Antwerp, where he teaches on the famous Dulcken 1747 harpsichord at Museum Vleeshuis as 'harpsichordist in residence'. At this conservatoire he is coordinating the Historically Informed Performance Practice programme and conducts projects with the many formations, in which he also coaches the conducting students. He teaches and conducts at the International Opera Academy Ghent and is doing PhD research at Antwerp University. Lectures, masterclasses and concerts brought him to the conservatories and universities of Manchester, Vilnius, Cambridge, Antwerp and Sydney. His discography, including solo works by Balbastre, Rameau and Weckbacher, now counts some thirty recordings. Several solo recordings were added to the prestigeous online 'All of Bach' series by The Netherlands Bach Society.Besides his concert career, he is a passionate and highly in-demand recording engineer and producer.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Musical Medicine for These Times!</h3>
<p>Thrive Choir has dreams to release our debut record this year! More than ever, our world needs soulful music that illuminates the joy, pain and beauty of what it means to be human in this time of cultural and systemic transformation.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>STRETCH GOAL: </strong></i> $30,000 will support us to follow our EP with a full 10 track album + more music videos!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Music That Makes a Difference.</h3>
<p>We are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A diverse choir of Black, African, Latino, Indigenous, European, Middle-Eastern, Asian &amp; mixed-descent singers honoring the power of the liberatory Black Gospel Music Tradition to create modern medicine-music for people of all backgrounds, faiths and cultures.</li>
<li>Activists, mothers, healers, educators, social entrepreneurs &amp; earth stewards who bring our passion and experience into original songs that fuel the social movements for justice.</li>
<li>The musical voice of Thrive East Bay and the Thrive Network, a community and movement devoted to <i>love in action </i>by building equitable systems where we can flourish as individuals, as communities, and as a planet.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to social change, we believe that music is not a luxury, but a necessity. Likewise, we hope to inspire our generation to be as courageous and visionary. </p>
<p>Our music is for the movement. We've led thousands of people in the streets at marches, like the Rise for Climate 2018 march. We bring song to community healing rituals around issues like police brutality and gun violence. Additionally, we've inspired thousands at social-change conferences and festivals like Bioneers and Lightning in a bottle. It's time to spread our music further.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With the COVID19 shutdown, we had to cancel all of our gigs for the foreseeable future. This didn't stop our community work, and we took our music online and to the streets to sing through masks for Black Lives. However, all of our income has frozen, and we are still $19,000 away from what we need to finish this record. </p>
<ul>
<li>Thankfully, we've already tracked many of our 18 part vocal harmonies, and though our gracious choir has volunteered their valuable time and energy, we still need to pay our engineer Austin for his time, as well as guest instrumentalists, mixing, mastering, and some other studio and recording fees.  We are honored to be working with Matt Hennessy &amp; VSOP Studios, who has worked with artists like Beyoncé, John Legend, Jamila Woods &amp; many more. He is already helping us sound even more epic.</li>
<li>We have many more unique perks listed below for our generous supporters who will support more generously like vocal lessons, custom musical covers, and more! </li>
</ul>
<p>We appreciate your generous support! Don't hold back! And, all contributors of $20 or more will receive a copy of the EP as soon as it's ready, and an invitation to a special sneak peak event!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Your Help Matters</h3>
<p>We have been pouring our love and energy into this music project for years. While success as an independent artist is a miracle of hard work and passion in itself, the coordination, democracy, and energy it takes to succeed as a 17 person music ensemble is a whole 'nother story!</p>
<ul>
<li>With the COVID19 pandemic, it may be over a year before we can raise these funds through performing safely!</li>
<li>We have full faith that this EP will help our music to have the kind of wings it needs for this project to prosper, and we don't say that lightly! We have spent years fine-tuning our craft, and we're ready to blast off!</li>

<h3>What's this all about?</h3>
<p>Over the last few years, I've written about everything that moves me, or fascinates me. That's one thing that holds this whole collection of music together; it's all from the heart.</p>
<p>I'm Kurt, a singer-songwriter and composer from New York. I started writing songs in my mid-20s, with a weekly project I called <i>A Song, A Poem, And A Picture</i>. I've followed my muse and honed my skills since then, always chasing after otherworldly experiences in music. For me, there's nothing like reaching into the ""ether"" (intuition, emotion, subconscious) and crystalizing something into a song, which both perfects an otherwise hard-to-access experience for me, and allows another person to experience it with me, or to make sense of their own experiences as they listen to the song.</p>
<p>These songs that I have ready to record, are the height of all that. My best work, and deeply personal. <strong>And I can't turn them into an album without your help.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Recording at the University of Montana: $100 to use the facilities, $200 for the engineer's time. (4 different sessions)</li>
<li>$520 goes to paying all the musicians at the ""big band"" recording session.</li>
<li>$200 goes to additional musicians recording their parts remotely.</li>
<li>$1,200 goes to the ""All Flesh Is Like Grass"" performance video at <i>Prosper Pianos</i>—this will be the culmination of what I've learned and practiced with video ads, and also just a really enjoyable video.</li>
<li>$400 goes toward having the album mastered by Aidan Brooks at <i>The Lab in HB</i>, where I recorded my first singles <i>Hills to Sleep in </i> and <i>Easter in SoHo.</i>
</li>
<li>$400 goes toward having the album mixed.</li>
<li>$160 goes to <i>CDBaby</i> to publish my music and get it on all relevant platforms: Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, Tidal, TikTok, etc.</li>
<li>$300 goes to CD duplication (yes, people still buy CDs!)</li>
<li>$250 goes toward having t-shirts printed</li>
<li>$100 goes toward marketing the album.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1 gets you a track from the album, and $3 gets you three tracks from the album. Every bit helps!</li>
<li>$10 gets you the whole album, as a digital download.</li>
<li>$25 gets you the album on CD, plus the digital download, and an assortment of visual and sonic goodies.</li>
<li>$45 gets you the T-shirt, and the digital download of the album,.</li>

<li>$150 gets you ""the complete collection""! The new CD, T-shirt, and digital download, plus my previous album <i>Kennedy</i> on 180-gram vinyl (and digital download), unreleased tracks of mine from the last 8 years, and PDFs of my musical arrangements (from both albums).</li>
<li>$220 gets you ""the personal touch"". The new CD and T-shirt, the <i>Kennedy</i> vinyl, and 3 Skype lessons on guitar, ukulele, or piano. You can also sub out the music lessons in favor of a home-cooked meal by me! [home cooked meal offered in NYC/Long Island and western Montana only]</li>
<li>$275 gets you a solo Skype concert! I'll perform your favorite songs of mine, maybe even throw in a cover song of your choosing. <i>And you also get the digital download, the CD, and </i>Kennedy<i> on vinyl. </i>
</li>
<li>$325 gets you an album credit (along with the new CD and <i>Kennedy</i> vinyl)</li>
<li>$400 gets you a custom made song! (plus CD, vinyl, and t-shirt)</li>
<li>$1,400 gets you a concert with a 5-piece version of my band! <i>*Travel costs apply outside NYC or Missoula</i>
</li>
<li>$2,100 gets you a concert with the ""full"" version of my band! <i>*Travel costs apply outside NYC or Missoula</i>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional Tiers!</h3>
<p>If we surpass the initial goal of $5,000, please don't stop giving! Every additional bit helps to make the album better and helps me to reach future fans with my music (no fans, no career!).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>If we reach $6,120, I can record my composition <i>Saturn</i> at The Bunker studio</strong>, where I did the whole <i>Kennedy </i>album. It's a mixed media project that involves analog tape, and I began writing it in 2013. *If we go over $5,000 but don't reach $6,210, these can go toward a few smaller things like a professional PR campaign or a low-budget music video (like I did for <i>Smoke</i>).</li>
<li>
<strong>If we reach $8,500, I can do all of that, plus a medium-budget music video</strong> (like I did for <i>Oh, Love</i>).</li>
<li><strong>If we reach $11,000, I can do all of <i>that</i>, plus have vinyl records made of the album!</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>What if the $_____ goal isn't reached?</h3>
<p>I'm confident we will raise the full amount, and then some! But if somehow that doesn't happen, it simply means some cost-cutting measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of having CDs pressed, I'll burn them on my laptop and draw the artwork myself.</li>
<li>I'll eliminate some or all group recording, and have the parts (cello, bass, etc.) recorded remotely by the lowest bidder—or if funding is <i>way</i> under, some parts could be done with software instruments.</li>
<li>I'll record only the top 3 songs in a studio, and figure out how to home record everything else.</li>
<li>I'll knit the t-shirts myself using yarn and thread found in local dumpsters. (I'm kidding.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, underfunding would create additional work and make things take longer, but it will still get done. The costs I just cannot cut are the <i>All Flesh Is Like Grass</i> performance video, having professionals mix and master the album, and having the t-shirts pressed (they are one of the perks, and unlike CDs I can't burn them on my laptop).</p>

Over the last few years, I've written about everything that moves me, or fascinates me. That's one thing that holds this whole collection of music together; it's all from the heart.
I'm Kurt, a singer-songwriter and composer from New York. I started writing songs in my mid-20s, with a weekly project I called A Song, A Poem, And A Picture. I've followed my muse and honed my skills since then, always chasing after otherworldly experiences in music. For me, there's nothing like reaching into the ""ether"" (intuition, emotion, subconscious) and crystalizing something into a song, which both perfects an otherwise hard-to-access experience for me, and allows another person to experience it with me, or to make sense of their own experiences as they listen to the song.
These songs that I have ready to record, are the height of all that. My best work, and deeply personal. And I can't turn them into an album without your help.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A More Lengthy Summary</h3>
<p>Well, where to start? I have been writing lyrics since the late eighties and have been recording albums for over twenty years now. I have formed or co-founded various bands, such as Trembling, TR0LL, Stars &amp; Moons Pillow and Nana's Favorite Gin, as well as my own solo music, Hasenfang. I have also collaborated with many other bands which I would rather not list off at this present time, seeing that I might forget a few and anger them. For the two decades I have made albums (<i>of which there are over twenty</i>), I always had always lived by two simple rules:</p>
<p>1.) Never sell any of our (<i>or my</i>) albums. Just give them away. </p>
<p>2.) Never play live, even if asked to do so (<i>i.e.; open for another band</i>).</p>
<p>Those rules were based on the mentality I had, to see just how far ""underground"" we could go and still get recognition. During that time, depending on which band[s], we have had radio air-time and even had some songs played at clubs. Even to this day, the name TR0LL is still being used at our old school, where it originated from, in relation to a particular person. Twenty years and still kicking. I would say after all this time, to still be noted for our music, even by not selling one album or playing live to a crowd, we have fulfilled that mission. Now, for the first time, I am looking forward to recording and producing and album which is of high quality and one I can finally market. I have come to indiegogo to promote this undertaking and ask for your help. Back in the day, we always provided our own funds to buy instruments, mixers, recording devices and materials to make our own music. Thousands and thousands of hard earned dollars were spent to make tapes or CD's to pass out, free of charge to anyone even slightly interested. But these days, now that I am married and main breadwinner for my wife, it is hard to come by the cash I need to get this album underway, especially when trying to make it of good quality sound and production. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A More Lengthy Summary II (On The Album)</h3>
<p>So, here we are...from starting of my birthday (<i>Feb. 26th</i>) and going for 40 days (<i>the age I have turned</i>), I will be running this indiegogo project. This is the first time I have ever asked for help when pressing a release, so believe me when I say I feel a bit awkward doing it in this fashion...and will feel even more awkward when actually selling the album. However, I would really like to see if I can pull such a thing off. After twenty years, I feel it is about time to try and I deeply appreciate anyone who helps, heck, to simply wish me luck, even if it is just an encouraging remark with no accompanied funds, I'll be grateful for that. I know in this day and age, extra cash is hard to come by, which is why I am trying to produce this at the lowest price possible and still have a good sound come from it. The album will be entitled Winter Walk With Me and is a follow up to my last album, Liaisons (<i>released on New Year's Eve 2008</i>). Usually, my albums are ""themed"", however, this one was a bit hard to nail down. The title itself is loosely tied to my joy of seeing the return of Twin Peaks coming back for a third season (<i>a mockery title of the film title Fire Walk With Me</i>). Sadly, the only song which seems to have a David Lynch / Angelo Badalamenti style to it is the last track, Lust &amp; The Douglas Fir. So, straying a bit from that, I have always loved the 80's New Wave / Synth-pop style. I can say this album will very Depeche Mode in essence, as well as having a hint of Darkwave genre, chirpy Steampunk and a trippy Ween flavor (f<i>or those who know those bands</i>). I'm trying to incorporate sounds which impressed me as a teen, during the late 80's and early 90's. </p>
<p>One thing I am doing new for the first time, is using a pinch-pull, drag-n-drop format of various music generator applications, such as Musicshake and Magix Music Maker. I always use to be hands on with my synth music, even playing the rapid arpeggio with my fingers. But, I wanted to see how well this style of music-making fitted with my lyrical sense, as well as over-dub my own sounds into the mix, to make a unique electronic experience. So far, it is coming along good. As of right now, the album has a track list of 17 songs and will be nearly 80 minutes in length. I am posting up the minimum amount it will take to mix and manufacture this item, as well as list the minimum amount for funding packages. I am looking forward to us achieving this project.</p>
<p>Thank you, </p>
<p>~Michael Hasenfang</p>

<br/>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<div>Well, here are some extra added bonuses I will toss into this project, if we can reach the funding posted. So here we go...</div>
<div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1349792/files/20150402114350-700.png?1428000230"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">REACHED! ~ At $700, I will switch from a Jewel Case to 4-Panel Digipak. As of right now, there will be a lyrics within. Not sure if I am going to go with a booklet, panel or poster. Guess I'll see which works best.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1263796/files/20150302225326-800.png?1425365606"" src="""" style=""""/></p>At $800 I will upgrade from 4 to a 6-Panel  Digipak.

<div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">If we reach $1000, this will give me just enough to make a Double Album. I will release Whiteout as the second CD. Yes, I know, I have it up for free on bandcamp. But with this extra funding, I can now master it through Channel Fuse Media (along with the vocal album), to give it a better quality sound. With this, you will now have both the vocal and instrumental versions of each album with great sound. NOTE: I am not sure all of what the manufacturing site has to offer for cases, but it seems with the double album, we might have to revert back to Jewel case (only downside to the upgrade).</span></p>

Home mixing will be done by myself, as well as Eric Hasenfang and Nick Chud. If we manage to get this stretch goal, I will take our work and allow it to be tweaked even more to professional album quality (this includes their mastering).<p></p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
</div>
<div>...More goals to come if we reach these...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Originally, I posted this project on kickstarter with a $1500 goal. Five days until that funding was suppose to end (<i>and at only $155 in</i>), I did some more intense research and found that I could produce the same amount thing, at different sites, for about $1100 less! So here I am, rehashing this project for way lower than intended. Actually, I only need about $400 to pull this project off. However, since indiegogo has a minimum starting point of $500 to get the ball rolling, we will make a goal with that amount. I have allowed this project ""Flexible Funding"", since I actually need less than what is posted to green-light the album. So, even though it won't say so on indiegogo, once the funds reach 80%, consider the album fully funded. </p>
<p>So, where am I going to get this done for so cheap, you might ask: Well, here are the links to the places I have chosen to proceed with the finishing of the album. I would also like to give a quick THANK YOU to Unifiedmfg, who contacted me during my kickstater campaign to inform me of their competitive prices. I'm glad they did. Anyway, here is what I am using on all levels:</p>

<p>Though I am sure there are some sites and businesses which offer cheaper deal, for the quality of what you get, these seem to be some of the best for the price. </p>
<p>What you, as a contributor will get, is a digital download and/or hard copy of the CD album, with a bit more, depending on which Perk you help fund.  </p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A Free Listen &amp; Download Of The Album [Instrumental Version]</h3>
<p>As a means to show you I'm pretty much done with the album, you can even listen to, as well as download, all the music laid so far, over on my bandcamp site. However, the music  you will be hearing is NOT the finished/finalized music, but merely a free download I am giving away to everyone, not just those who contribute. Once the album is completely accomplished these tracks will have vocals, as well as a few more blurps and chirps of musical fun.

I will be checking pout various stretch goals, which I can add into this CD to make it all the more impressive. I'd rather not just toss in random garbage, like extra posters, stickers and whatnot, but would rather see what I can do to improve the album more. I will post up stretch goals as soon I find some interesting ones to work with. Thanks again!

A More Lengthy Summary
Well, where to start? I have been writing lyrics since the late eighties and have been recording albums for over twenty years now. I have formed or co-founded various bands, such as Trembling, TR0LL, Stars & Moons Pillow and Nana's Favorite Gin, as well as my own solo music, Hasenfang. I have also collaborated with many other bands which I would rather not list off at this present time, seeing that I might forget a few and anger them. For the two decades I have made albums (of which there are over twenty), I always had always lived by two simple rules:
1.) Never sell any of our (or my) albums. Just give them away. 
2.) Never play live, even if asked to do so (i.e.; open for another band).
Those rules were based on the mentality I had, to see just how far ""underground"" we could go and still get recognition. During that time, depending on which band[s], we have had radio air-time and even had some songs played at clubs. Even to this day, the name TR0LL is still being used at our old school, where it originated from, in relation to a particular person. Twenty years and still kicking. I would say after all this time, to still be noted for our music, even by not selling one album or playing live to a crowd, we have fulfilled that mission. Now, for the first time, I am looking forward to recording and producing and album which is of high quality and one I can finally market. I have come to indiegogo to promote this undertaking and ask for your help. Back in the day, we always provided our own funds to buy instruments, mixers, recording devices and materials to make our own music. Thousands and thousands of hard earned dollars were spent to make tapes or CD's to pass out, free of charge to anyone even slightly interested. But these days, now that I am married and main breadwinner for my wife, it is hard to come by the cash I need to get this album underway, especially when trying to make it of good quality sound and production. 




A More Lengthy Summary II (On The Album)
So, here we are...from starting of my birthday (Feb. 26th) and going for 40 days (the age I have turned), I will be running this indiegogo project. This is the first time I have ever asked for help when pressing a release, so believe me when I say I feel a bit awkward doing it in this fashion...and will feel even more awkward when actually selling the album. However, I would really like to see if I can pull such a thing off. After twenty years, I feel it is about time to try and I deeply appreciate anyone who helps, heck, to simply wish me luck, even if it is just an encouraging remark with no accompanied funds, I'll be grateful for that. I know in this day and age, extra cash is hard to come by, which is why I am trying to produce this at the lowest price possible and still have a good sound come from it. The album will be entitled Winter Walk With Me and is a follow up to my last album, Liaisons (released on New Year's Eve 2008). Usually, my albums are ""themed"", however, this one was a bit hard to nail down. The title itself is loosely tied to my joy of seeing the return of Twin Peaks coming back for a third season (a mockery title of the film title Fire Walk With Me). Sadly, the only song which seems to have a David Lynch / Angelo Badalamenti style to it is the last track, Lust & The Douglas Fir. So, straying a bit from that, I have always loved the 80's New Wave / Synth-pop style. I can say this album will very Depeche Mode in essence, as well as having a hint of Darkwave genre, chirpy Steampunk and a trippy Ween flavor (for those who know those bands). I'm trying to incorporate sounds which impressed me as a teen, during the late 80's and early 90's. 
One thing I am doing new for the first time, is using a pinch-pull, drag-n-drop format of various music generator applications, such as Musicshake and Magix Music Maker. I always use to be hands on with my synth music, even playing the rapid arpeggio with my fingers. But, I wanted to see how well this style of music-making fitted with my lyrical sense, as well as over-dub my own sounds into the mix, to make a unique electronic experience. So far, it is coming along good. As of right now, the album has a track list of 17 songs and will be nearly 80 minutes in length. I am posting up the minimum amount it will take to mix and manufacture this item, as well as list the minimum amount for funding packages. I am looking forward to us achieving this project.
Thank you, 
~Michael Hasenfang

Album Track Listing 




NOTE: As of 03/05/2015, the album will now have 18 tracks and be 80 minutes long! This is an added bonus I have made for all, since we reached our funding goal.


Stretch Goals
Well, here are some extra added bonuses I will toss into this project, if we can reach the funding posted. So here we go...



REACHED! ~ At $700, I will switch from a Jewel Case to 4-Panel Digipak. As of right now, there will be a lyrics within. Not sure if I am going to go with a booklet, panel or poster. Guess I'll see which works best.


At $800 I will upgrade from 4 to a 6-Panel  Digipak. This will give me two extra sides to work with for extra artwork, pictures and/or info.


If we reach $1000, this will give me just enough to make a Double Album. I will release Whiteout as the second CD. Yes, I know, I have it up for free on bandcamp. But with this extra funding, I can now master it through Channel Fuse Media (along with the vocal album), to give it a better quality sound. With this, you will now have both the vocal and instrumental versions of each album with great sound. NOTE: I am not sure all of what the manufacturing site has to offer for cases, but it seems with the double album, we might have to revert back to Jewel case (only downside to the upgrade).

At $1500, I will also include Professional Mixing into the Mastering done at Channel Fuse Media. Home mixing will be done by myself, as well as Eric Hasenfang and Nick Chud. If we manage to get this stretch goal, I will take our work and allow it to be tweaked even more to professional album quality (this includes their mastering).

At $2500 I can afford to master and mix both of the albums.


...More goals to come if we reach these...

What I Need & What You Get
Originally, I posted this project on kickstarter with a $1500 goal. Five days until that funding was suppose to end (and at only $155 in), I did some more intense research and found that I could produce the same amount thing, at different sites, for about $1100 less! So here I am, rehashing this project for way lower than intended. Actually, I only need about $400 to pull this project off. However, since indiegogo has a minimum starting point of $500 to get the ball rolling, we will make a goal with that amount. I have allowed this project ""Flexible Funding"", since I actually need less than what is posted to green-light the album. So, even though it won't say so on indiegogo, once the funds reach 80%, consider the album fully funded. 
So, where am I going to get this done for so cheap, you might ask: Well, here are the links to the places I have chosen to proceed with the finishing of the album. I would also like to give a quick THANK YOU to Unifiedmfg, who contacted me during my kickstater campaign to inform me of their competitive prices. I'm glad they did. Anyway, here is what I am using on all levels:
RECORDING
Pro-Tools
M-Audio
Magix Music Maker
Musicshake
MASTERING: 
LANDR (once I am done with the home recording, I send my own mix through LANDR, for a quick buff, then off to...)
Channel Fuse Media
MANUFACTURING
Unified Manufacturing
Though I am sure there are some sites and businesses which offer cheaper deal, for the quality of what you get, these seem to be some of the best for the price. 
What you, as a contributor will get, is a digital download and/or hard copy of the CD album, with a bit more, depending on which Perk you help fund.  

A Free Listen & Download Of The Album [Instrumental Version]
As a means to show you I'm pretty much done with the album, you can even listen to, as well as download, all the music laid so far, over on my bandcamp site. However, the music  you will be hearing is NOT the finished/finalized music, but merely a free download I am giving away to everyone, not just those who contribute. Once the album is completely accomplished these tracks will have vocals, as well as a few more blurps and chirps of musical fun. Until then, enjoy this FREE un-mastered instrumental version of the album:

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Since 2004, Aquabear Legion has served to promote and support Ohio music and art and has been run by founders Brian Koscho and Todd Jacops since then. With 17 releases (mostly compilations from over the years) since then on vinyl, cd, tape, and digital, Aquabear comes into 2021 ready to make two more (new) archival compilations. We also have some awesome new merchandise with art from our good friend Matthew Presutti to help make that happen. Aquabear Legion is a labor of love and long-time passion for Brian and Todd. These pre-orders serve as a way to make these projects happen and also to help cover the Legion's minimal annual expenses to exist.</p>
<p><strong>THESE ARE MY JEWELS</strong> (abl-018)<br/>an archival compilation of Ohio music from before 2004 featuring: 333, Bob City, Bubba Ho-Tep,  The Bygones, Guinea Worms, The Husher, Kelley Deal, Kiddo, Kill the Hippies, Mike Rep &amp; The Quotas, Moviola, Necropolis, Pimpy Accelerator, Proletarian Art Threat, Special Aviation Project, The Spiveys, and more.</p>

<p>In return for your advance support, you can get copies of the new compilations, shirts, hoodies, prints, and of course the huge selection of records, tapes, and more from past Aquabear releases.</p>
