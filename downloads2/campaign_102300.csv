<p> </p>DUAL GEAR is the 6 meters humanoid vehicle for military tactical developed side by side with astronaut robotic technology from  the biggest worldwide cooperation of space development organization to built the orbital energy station ""Gaia Belt""(also known as the Gaia Belt project). Trinity Element(TEC), the company associated with the most powerful government produced the first dual gears squad for space orbital defend (Call Orbital Gear at the first) until Gaia Belt was attacked by unidentified terrorist. TEC make the decision to deploy the Orbital Gear squad to intercept the terrorist. Despite their impressive effort, the Gaia Belt is heavily damaged. After the incident, the Orbital Gear evolved into Dual Gear, a surface tactical unit. TEC begin mass producing DG and sold them to the client worldwide, including the PMC.</div>
<div>
<br/><b>Movement System</b><p>Dual Gear used original movement inspired from Japanese mecha Anime. Several movement will remind you of several classic Japanese Mecha Anime.</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453461687/ydxnq3bbiyomv5bopa1c.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <p>The game uses GP gauge as the energy for the mech to move.  movement such as the regular move to location, dash and boost will consume the GP gauge. When depleted, the unit won't be able to move anymore that turn.</p>
<br/><b>Combat System</b>
</div>
<div>
<p>The attack system of DUAL GEAR is a mixed of real-time shooting and quick performance(skill, etc) cut scene. </p>
<p>The game uses a system called Action Skill, which is a combined of two elements. First is the action point(AP), the other is the Generator Output(GP). Every skill will have their own requirement to activate.</p>
<p>for example, the weapon that has huge damage output or ability to hit multiple targets will need 1 or 2 action point and a lot of GP to activate.</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453437475/kythixa7gic3xbnktt7j.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Like basic classic TBS game, the combat system included the range and percentage accuracy. Both are related with pilot status and any weapon equipped. Skill may have an effect on them too, increasing or decreasing the accuracy, making more damage or have more chance to get a critical hit. </p>
<p><b>Turn by turn and unit by unit </b></p>
<p>From the third-person perspective gameplay, the important of the system is how to order multiple units in the squad. The game limited the of the movement and attack  by GP gauge and action point. While the unit is moving, the enemy within range will attack the player unit. The attacking will stop when player mech stops moving,  this opens the player to plan out a strategy.  Should we attack another enemy or move to the new position again before changing the unit or ending turn. This system made squad and resource management extremely important.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Weapons </b></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.dualgeargame.com/img/animpic/DG_weapon.gif"" src="""" style=""""/> <b> </b><p> </p>
<p>All skill come from the weapon. The player will get the skill from any weapon equipped, which can easily be assign into the skill wheel.  As the pilot become more experience, they will unlock new skills. All DG unit have a capacity to attach 4+1 weapon included L arm ,R arm, L shoulder, R shoulder and plus with some backpack have a weapon built in. Try out the Pre-Apha demo if you want to know how any weapon work!</p>

<p><b>Damage System</b></p>
<p>DUAL GEAR has a durability system set by AP&amp;CP gauge. AP gauge is Armor Power. This is the durability of outer armor. CP gauge is Core Power. it's mean the durability gauge of the inner frame. AP is the first protection before CP when AP is 0, Outer armor will be destroyed. After that the part will have only CP to received damage. The parts will be destroyed when the CP are depleted.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453437676/uhzonqfdx0xlldeixckd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>All part and armor are destroyable. When they do, they will have several effect to the unit to the unit. For Example, when the mech lost a right arm, you will also lose the ability to use the weapon on that arm. If the leg has taken a lot of damage, the movement will be slow and consume more GP than normal.<br/> <p><b>Hangar System</b></p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.dualgeargame.com/img/animpic/DG_hangar.gif"" src="""" style=""""/><br/> <p>Hangar mode is the command center of your mech squad. Upgrade &amp; Build your squad, custom your unit, mission briefing, and find the secret story from here. The hangar will evolve (DG part in store, mission quest or etc) depend on your location of the mother base (there are several scatter around the world).  Let see the detail  below about this game mode.</p>
<p><b>Mech Customization </b></p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.dualgeargame.com/img/animpic/DG_customize.gif"" src="""" style=""""/><p> </p>
<p>DUAL GEAR let the  player custom their own mech and team. Every DG is composed of five main parts, The Main Camera(Head), Cockpit, Arms, Legs and Back Pack. Each part have unique initial status and role in the game. As an example, the high weight Legs have a higher durability and resistant value. However, it will slow the DG movement down and use a lot of GP when that mech move.</p>

<p><b>Carrier System</b></p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.dualgeargame.com/img/animpic/DG_carrier.gif"" src="""" style=""""/><br/> <p>The carrier system  is very necessary for all mission, as it is the way the squad enters the battlefield.

<br/>The game encouraged the player to discover and unlock mission around the world.<div>Every mission will be replayable, in order to discover new part, secret intel, and hidden story line. The player can also set a handicap for the mission for higher rewards and EXP.<br/><br/><b>Pilot Recruit System</b><br/>As a commander of one of the PMC, it is crucial on recruiting pilot. Through the command center around the world, you can recruit experienced and skillful pilot. Every pilot can gain EXP and LV up, gaining skills and abilities as well. The better your pilot is, the stronger your squad become. <br/><br/><b>Tactical Negotiation System</b><br/>This is one of the ideas we are planning to add in the future. When the enemy unit surrendered and is in the white flag condition. The play will be able to attempt to recruit them into your pilot. There will also be chances of getting new parts from negotiation too. The negotiation is counted as Action Skill.<br/><br/><b>Dual Drive (Deva Drive or CSD)</b><br/>The system helped the pilot to control the DG. The DD, a device base on quantum computing, worked directly with pilot conscious. The process 90% mapped the human brain, allowing the pilot to be more efficient with the DualGear. This system is related to the chain combination attack that we will release more detail soon.</div>

<p>DUAL GEAR is set in  2064, The new beginning of space innovation. The new energy source was discovered in space.  Most powerful nations of the world and various astronautic organization integration to build the largest structure on the earth orbit call Gaia Belt, the photon&amp;microwave energy receiver station from the moon power plant. </p>
<p>Gaia Belt project affect the astronautic robotic technology greatly, hasten the development of the astronautic development. 2101, the first phase of Gaia Belt is completed and the testing of the microwave receiver begun. Then an unidentified terrorist attack the station. Despite a heroic attempt of the Orbital Gear squad to intercept the attack, the station was heavily damaged. The attack destroys part of the station, causing it an explosion. The explosion causes a chain reaction, destroying several other orbital structures and falling into Earth. The incident leaves behind ruin atmosphere and severe destructive outcome on Earth. The world would need 100 years to recover from this incident.</p>
<p>TEC blame the other organization as being too weak and force them out of the space program. They leave the astronautic development behind and turn to focus on more militaristic development instead.</p>
<p>DUAL GEAR is the result of the Gaia Belt incident. TEC began selling the war machines to military around the world.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are a small studio with little budget. We run the studio with a little outsource work and separated some of that income into developing Dual Gear. The challenge is that we need to create this game at the highest of quality we can make. </p>
<p> If we raise enough fund, we can improve the performance and graphic of this game. We would have a more complete sound dialogue, cutscene, and narrative script. This also allows us to developed this game for all console at the same time. Even if did not reach the initial goal,  we would still continue the development until the finish.

Welcome to the crowdfunding campaign for DUAL GEAR  a turn based strategy game combination with action gameplay inspired from classical Japanese MECH(Giant Robot) turn based strategy games. 
This is our first original game develop with our inspiration and passion about old classic TBS genre and with the love of Japanese Mecha. With your support, we'll make the game be that all Mecha lover and Turn based game lover will enjoy!
 
 
 
Turn Based Strategy X Action

 Pilot your mech and keep a tactical play by turn based system. The system is the combination between 2 types of gameplay. 
Giving the player experience of the pilot themselves and at the same time, the player needed to think about the tactic and strategy. Making the reaction,  management of resource and awareness of the mission extremely important. Tactical humanoid Vehicle (THV) ""DUAL GEAR""
EGE-01 SIDEWINDER
 

EGE-01L ACID VIPER
 

EGE-01L ACID VIPER HOVER TYPE WITH LONG RANGE RIFLE
 

EGE-01 SIDEWINDER TANK TYPE
 
  
 DUAL GEAR is the 6 meters humanoid vehicle for military tactical developed side by side with astronaut robotic technology from  the biggest worldwide cooperation of space development organization to built the orbital energy station ""Gaia Belt""(also known as the Gaia Belt project). Trinity Element(TEC), the company associated with the most powerful government produced the first dual gears squad for space orbital defend (Call Orbital Gear at the first) until Gaia Belt was attacked by unidentified terrorist. TEC make the decision to deploy the Orbital Gear squad to intercept the terrorist. Despite their impressive effort, the Gaia Belt is heavily damaged. After the incident, the Orbital Gear evolved into Dual Gear, a surface tactical unit. TEC begin mass producing DG and sold them to the client worldwide, including the PMC.

Movement SystemDual Gear used original movement inspired from Japanese mecha Anime. Several movement will remind you of several classic Japanese Mecha Anime.  The game uses GP gauge as the energy for the mech to move.  movement such as the regular move to location, dash and boost will consume the GP gauge. When depleted, the unit won't be able to move anymore that turn.
Combat System


The attack system of DUAL GEAR is a mixed of real-time shooting and quick performance(skill, etc) cut scene. 
The game uses a system called Action Skill, which is a combined of two elements. First is the action point(AP), the other is the Generator Output(GP). Every skill will have their own requirement to activate.
for example, the weapon that has huge damage output or ability to hit multiple targets will need 1 or 2 action point and a lot of GP to activate. 
Like basic classic TBS game, the combat system included the range and percentage accuracy. Both are related with pilot status and any weapon equipped. Skill may have an effect on them too, increasing or decreasing the accuracy, making more damage or have more chance to get a critical hit. 
Turn by turn and unit by unit 
From the third-person perspective gameplay, the important of the system is how to order multiple units in the squad. The game limited the of the movement and attack  by GP gauge and action point. While the unit is moving, the enemy within range will attack the player unit. The attacking will stop when player mech stops moving,  this opens the player to plan out a strategy.  Should we attack another enemy or move to the new position again before changing the unit or ending turn. This system made squad and resource management extremely important.
 
Weapons 
   
All skill come from the weapon. The player will get the skill from any weapon equipped, which can easily be assign into the skill wheel.  As the pilot become more experience, they will unlock new skills. All DG unit have a capacity to attach 4+1 weapon included L arm ,R arm, L shoulder, R shoulder and plus with some backpack have a weapon built in. Try out the Pre-Apha demo if you want to know how any weapon work!
See how to equip skills !

Example ingame weapons.





Damage System
DUAL GEAR has a durability system set by AP&CP gauge. AP gauge is Armor Power. This is the durability of outer armor. CP gauge is Core Power. it's mean the durability gauge of the inner frame. AP is the first protection before CP when AP is 0, Outer armor will be destroyed. After that the part will have only CP to received damage. The parts will be destroyed when the CP are depleted.
All part and armor are destroyable. When they do, they will have several effect to the unit to the unit. For Example, when the mech lost a right arm, you will also lose the ability to use the weapon on that arm. If the leg has taken a lot of damage, the movement will be slow and consume more GP than normal. Hangar System  Hangar mode is the command center of your mech squad. Upgrade & Build your squad, custom your unit, mission briefing, and find the secret story from here. The hangar will evolve (DG part in store, mission quest or etc) depend on your location of the mother base (there are several scatter around the world).  Let see the detail  below about this game mode.
Mech Customization   
DUAL GEAR let the  player custom their own mech and team. Every DG is composed of five main parts, The Main Camera(Head), Cockpit, Arms, Legs and Back Pack. Each part have unique initial status and role in the game. As an example, the high weight Legs have a higher durability and resistant value. However, it will slow the DG movement down and use a lot of GP when that mech move.
See the how to coloring your DG! The player can custom the color, add pattern and camouflage of the DG part by part. Don't forget to choose your emblem and become the ace right now! 
Carrier System  The carrier system  is very necessary for all mission, as it is the way the squad enters the battlefield. Some mission will need a land carrier like a big trailer, air carrier to enter the ocean battlefield or The orbital carrier  for the space battlefield. There will be at lease 10 type of the carrier player can choose from. Every carrier will have different stat and ability, DualGear capacity they can carry and even support fire abilities.
Mission System 

The game encouraged the player to discover and unlock mission around the world.Every mission will be replayable, in order to discover new part, secret intel, and hidden story line. The player can also set a handicap for the mission for higher rewards and EXP.Pilot Recruit SystemAs a commander of one of the PMC, it is crucial on recruiting pilot. Through the command center around the world, you can recruit experienced and skillful pilot. Every pilot can gain EXP and LV up, gaining skills and abilities as well. The better your pilot is, the stronger your squad become. Tactical Negotiation SystemThis is one of the ideas we are planning to add in the future. When the enemy unit surrendered and is in the white flag condition. The play will be able to attempt to recruit them into your pilot. There will also be chances of getting new parts from negotiation too. The negotiation is counted as Action Skill.Dual Drive (Deva Drive or CSD)The system helped the pilot to control the DG. The DD, a device base on quantum computing, worked directly with pilot conscious. The process 90% mapped the human brain, allowing the pilot to be more efficient with the DualGear. This system is related to the chain combination attack that we will release more detail soon.

Story
DUAL GEAR is set in  2064, The new beginning of space innovation. The new energy source was discovered in space.  Most powerful nations of the world and various astronautic organization integration to build the largest structure on the earth orbit call Gaia Belt, the photon&microwave energy receiver station from the moon power plant. 
Gaia Belt project affect the astronautic robotic technology greatly, hasten the development of the astronautic development. 2101, the first phase of Gaia Belt is completed and the testing of the microwave receiver begun. Then an unidentified terrorist attack the station. Despite a heroic attempt of the Orbital Gear squad to intercept the attack, the station was heavily damaged. The attack destroys part of the station, causing it an explosion. The explosion causes a chain reaction, destroying several other orbital structures and falling into Earth. The incident leaves behind ruin atmosphere and severe destructive outcome on Earth. The world would need 100 years to recover from this incident.
TEC blame the other organization as being too weak and force them out of the space program. They leave the astronautic development behind and turn to focus on more militaristic development instead.
DUAL GEAR is the result of the Gaia Belt incident. TEC began selling the war machines to military around the world.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>How funds will be used...  30% of the funds will go to the dev team 
to completely re code the hard code files, to change it from a arcade to
 Simulation. Estimated time of completion is around February, This is a 
very daunting and time consuming task that involves writing thousand 
upon thousands line of new code. The remaining 70% will be used to setup
 a server farm including programming maintenance and most of all to 
support the loads of bandwidth to make sure the streams are fluid.
<br/>Currently there are more then 10 thousand players using the previous
  Super Mod Lite test version, and currently adding new players daily, 
so there should be no shortage of players to play against. once the 
Super Mod is released.</p><br/></div>","When you thought Simulators couldn't get any better, you haven't seen anything yet!

very important, all other parts will be very heavily modified, using 
proprietary coding and Image bending techniques, that are impossible to 
duplicate making this Mod a must have on top of the game.In April
 2016 the 2015 version will be re-coded and injected into the Super Mod 
making them work in tandem  so 2014 and 2015 can be played in a same 
session.Now to back up our claim, this being the absolute 
best Simulator out there, we are including videos comparing the Mod to 
all other Driving Games currently out for comparison, that feature any 
type of open wheel race cars, and some actual F1 Simulators.rFactorF1 2015F1 Simulator , Compare the difference!!!Game Stock Car ExtremerFactor2Project CarsF1  Simulator, Compare the Difference!!!
Risks and challenges
How funds will be used...  30% of the funds will go to the dev team 
to completely re code the hard code files, to change it from a arcade to
 Simulation. Estimated time of completion is around February, This is a 
very daunting and time consuming task that involves writing thousand 
upon thousands line of new code. The remaining 70% will be used to setup
 a server farm including programming maintenance and most of all to 
support the loads of bandwidth to make sure the streams are fluid.
Currently there are more then 10 thousand players using the previous
  Super Mod Lite test version, and currently adding new players daily, 
so there should be no shortage of players to play against. once the 
Super Mod is released.",0.0,8,"3 Campaigns

<p>We have invested a lot of time, effort and money into
investigating what works well for a gaming environment by investing into new
technologies. We have taken the time to build up our partnerships and get to
know the companies involved in the new Virtual Reality movement.</p>
<p>We now need that push to set it all up in the vision that we
see fit. We want to do it our way in the vision that we have built. If we go
out to investors we have to take them into consideration when we make changes
or move to fit new technologies. If we can succeed in our Indiegogo campaign
it will keep the direction of the company completely within our control.</p>

Then take it away with you afterwards so you can watch it all again or even better have us upload it to your personal AG storage so you can just share it with a click.

Why are we doing an Indiegogo campaign?
We have invested a lot of time, effort and money into
investigating what works well for a gaming environment by investing into new
technologies. We have taken the time to build up our partnerships and get to
know the companies involved in the new Virtual Reality movement.
We now need that push to set it all up in the vision that we
see fit. We want to do it our way in the vision that we have built. If we go
out to investors we have to take them into consideration when we make changes
or move to fit new technologies. If we can succeed in our Indiegogo campaign
it will keep the direction of the company completely within our control.
Perks
Everyone who donates will be put onto our perk wall to show your support for us.
All the perks below $100 are different rewards based upon what people would like.
Everything above $100 will include the rewards below this. Each person will get a t-shirt and polo along with our USB showing that they supported us in our campaign.
T-shirts and polos will come in all sizes. We'll gather up the sizes after the campaign ends. The designs of these will be posted shortly.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3>
<p>My name is John Yates.  I am a complex guy with a lot of interests and passions.  But one of my primary passions is collecting, playing, and sharing pinball machines with others.  I’ve been obsessed with pinball since I was in 3rd grade.  One of my friends at church had two pinball machines in his basement, and I was quickly addicted.  Ever since, I have loved pinball.  I feel something deeply nostalgic and visceral when playing pinball.  I have been buying, selling, and trading pinball machines for 28 years, since I was 19.  </p>
<p><br/>This campaign represents the culmination of 28 years of learning, searching, collecting, financial struggle and preparation.  I have finally reached the point where my dream is within reach – to open a Pinball Museum where the public can come to play pinball and share my love of the game.  I have amassed a collection of 150 of the best pinball machines spanning 70 years.  I’ve launched two arcade museums, both of which are surviving and pleasing visitors every week.  I have found the perfect building for my dream.  Now I just need some financial help in order to purchase and renovate the building for this Pinball Museum.  </p>
<p><br/>Contributors to this campaign will be responsible for making this Pinball Museum possible.  I will freely supply all of my time and talents, as well as the cream of my pinball collection.  I will hire a local contractor to do a few things I can’t, but  I will personally work full-time doing all of the work on the building that I’m capable of, and will personally rebuild and restore every pinball machine that will go inside.  I did 90+% of the work renovating and launching Arcadia, my main arcade museum,  This included all framing, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, tile, painting, as well as all of the work on the games themselves.</p>
<p><br/>But without contributions, I’m afraid I can’t stretch myself any thinner financially.  I’ve already poured my life and every penny I’ve earned since college graduation into acquiring the games, buildings, and skills needed.  And I have borrowed all I can to make the other two arcade museums possible and keep their doors open.   </p>
<h3>
<br/>WHAT WE NEED<br/>
</h3>
<p>I’m only attempting to raise the money needed to purchase and renovate the building that will house this Pinball Museum.  I am not asking for a dime to fund my time or effort, nor any money for any pinball machines that will go inside.  I will give all of that.  The pinball machines I have earmarked for the museum and already own have a retail value of over $100k.  </p>
<p><br/>I am seeking to raise $52,380 to make this project a reality.  This money will be spent as follows (some exact, some approximate estimates):  </p>
<ul>
<li>$ 30,000 to purchase and close on the building</li>
<li>$ 6,271 to replace all of the windows with new ones that match the 
style, but are double-paned and high-efficiency. The current windows are
 beautiful, but rotten and inefficient<br/>
</li>
<li>$ 5,234 to repair / replace the facia, soffets, gutters, and edges of the roof which are rotted out</li>
<li>$ 3,500 for a spiral staircase and other construction materials to 
allow access to the full basement, which we can also fill with games</li>
<li>$ 2,500 to re-plumb the building (needed badly), replace the water heater with a tankless, move the toilet, and modify the bathroom slightly</li>
<li>$ 2,500 to either strip and refinish the floor or purchase and install new carpet</li>
<li>$ 1,500 for miscellaneous new fixtures, electrical supplies, switches, doors, door hardware, locks, security system, etc</li>
<li>$ 600 for supplies needed to repair and refinish the historic, awesome entry door</li>
<li>$ 275 for a new custom chimney cap including installation</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>WHAT YOU WILL GET<br/>
</h3>
<p>We have all kinds of perks to offer contributors to this project.  And let me say right off the bat, these perks will never expire (as long as I'm alive and in business).<br/></p>
<p><br/>For the top perk, we can offer a restored arcade game or pinball machine. Other top perks include free lodging in our just-launched Arcade-themed BnB, called Hotel Arcadia.  This hotel suite rents for between $199 and $249 per night, and offers two huge HD movie / gaming setups, 4 full-sized video games with over 800 games you can play for free, an Addams Family pinball for 25 cents per play, and a fun Kids’ Loft where your kids can play games and sleep in their own “secret hideaway.”  If you live a long ways away and are not sure when you can make it to central Illinois, have no fear.  Your free night in Arcadia will never expire.  Just come when you can.<br/></p>
<p><br/>Another perk we can offer is a free play party for you and your friends at Pinball Paradise, once it’s open.  Of course we will have T-Shirts available from Arcadia, Pinball Paradise, and Hotel Arcadia for smaller donations.  And anyone who donates at least $25 will get a certificate for a roll of quarters to get them started on their next visit to Pinball Paradise.</p>
<p>I do not have logos designed yet for Pinball Paradise or Hotel Arcadia.  If any of you are graphic designers and would like to help me by offering suggestions for logos, I would be thrilled.  I am not a graphic designer.  You can email ideas to vintagevideogames.com@gmail.com.<br/></p>
<p><br/>If we do not reach our financial goal with this campaign, the funds that are raised will still be used for building and launching Pinball Paradise.  We will NOT use the funds for anything different.  Pinball Paradise WILL happen…it is just a matter of how soon we’re able to complete it.  If we raise all of the funds needed, we will open Pinball Paradise by May 2016 and possibly sooner.  If we do not raise all of the needed funds, it will take longer, proportionally to how short we fall of our goal.   </p>
<h3>
<br/>THE IMPACT<br/>
</h3>
<p>This museum is needed.  Pinball was born and raised in Illinois, and there are pitifully few places left in Illinois where the public can play pinball.  Sure, there are lots of wealthy pinball collectors with great collections in their basements.  But if you don’t have an extra $10k to spend on a modern pinball machine, there is almost no where you can go anymore to enjoy pinball, or to show your kids what you grew up playing.  The one large pinball arcade in southern IL closed its doors in 2015.  Arcadia (my arcade museum) has a handful of pinball machines available for play, but it only scratches the surface and leaves vast eras of great games untouched.</p>
<p><br/>Where can you play a classic Magic Town, Wizard, Captain Fantastic, Skylab, Gorgar, Space Invaders, High Speed, Comet, Earthshaker, Batman pinball?  Nowhere.  Your contribution will result in the opening of a place with about 40 playable pinball machines (to start, more later) from the 1950s through the 2000s.  And we will be open weekly as long as I’m alive (I’m 47).  </p>
<p>Pinball Paradise is very conveniently located for travelers, as well.  McLean, IL is right along Interstate 55, exactly halfway between Chicago and St. Louis.  It is also, amazingly, right on historic Route 66!  We have travelers literally from all over the world driving by this building every day as they trek down ole' 66 from Chicago to California! There is a world-class airport in Bloomington, just 15 miles from Pinball Paradise. <br/></p>
<p><br/>I can deliver and make this Pinball Museum happen with your contributions.  I have a track record of taking projects like this from conception to completion by sheer force of will.  </p>
<p><br/>Look at my primary arcade museum, Arcadia.  Here is what the building looked like before I started the renovation:  <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.611171515677751.1073741827.609860809142155&amp;type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.611171515677751.1073741827.609860809142155&amp;type=3</a></p>
<p>Here are some pictures during the renovation: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.611184275676475.1073741829.609860809142155&amp;type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.61118...</a><br/></p>
<p>It took me years to do, but I transformed this shambles of a building into a completely renovated, modern, top notch space with 70+ restored, fully working arcade games.  It took an immense amount of time, energy, and money, but I made it happen (by God’s grace and with His help).  </p>
<p><br/>Another big arcade project I have completed is Hotel Arcadia (mentioned above).  You can see all the details at airbnb, the booking agent for the place.  Just go to <a href=""http://www.airbnb.com,"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.airbnb.com,</a> and search for McLean, IL and you will find Hotel Arcadia.  This was another massive project where I had to transform a wreck of a building into a new, modern, high-tech, arcade themed hotel suite with kitchen, full bath, game room, kids’ loft, and movie room.  It took two years and lots of money and work, but I made it happen.  </p>
<p><br/>Another project that I have at least completed phase 1 of is the Route 66 Arcade Museum, which is just 5 miles down the road from Arcadia.  I have big plans to expand this museum after Pinball Paradise is completed.</p>
<p><br/>The reason I am attempting to raise funds using crowdfunding for the first time, is so that I can complete this project more quickly.  I am fairly confident that I could make this dream happen one way or another eventually on my own.  But I am not getting any younger, and I have a lot more plans after Pinball Paradise.  I don’t want to have to spend 2 or 3 (or more) years getting it off the ground, but would love to have it done by May and be able to see people playing and enjoying pinball there this summer.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>HURDLES TO OVERCOME</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>There really aren’t any significant hurdles to be overcome in bringing this project to completion other than finances.  I am already in the process of purchasing the building.  It is zoned properly for this use.  It already has the necessary utilities and a sound HVAC system.  It is a good, solid building with no serious issues to address.  I have already invested almost $100k in all of the pinball machines and parts needed to fill the museum when completed.  And there is nothing needing to be done that I have not already done in the past.  It just comes down to how long it takes to come up with the money needed for the building and repairs.  And I really don’t need very much money, as you can see above.  We can do this!<br/></p>
<br/><p>If you will help me with a contribution, you will be keeping pinball alive in Illinois by opening a place where anyone can play the best pinballs from the last 50 years.  We have hosted several Pinball tournaments at Arcadia, and this will continue and expand at Pinball Paradise.  I will also immortalize the top 40 contributors on a plaque that will be hung inside Pinball Paradise for all time.  <br/></p>
<p>I promise to be accountable for every dollar donated, and will show how the money is spent as it is spent.  I will not, like others who have solicited donations for arcade related projects, simply take the money and buy a bunch of new games for my personal collection.  That is offensive, deceitful, and wrong.  </p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>CONCLUSION<br/>
</h3>
<p>If you aren’t in a position to help with a donation, I understand.  But you can still help in several ways.  Please share this campaign with others you know who might be interested and able to make a contribution.  You can also visit Arcadia: America’s Playable Arcade Museum and contribute simply by playing some of our games.  We can slowly earn the money we need, one quarter at a time!  Finally, you could stay at Hotel Arcadia, or tell your friends about it.  <a href=""https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5308078"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5308078</a></p>
<p><br/>It really won’t take much from each contributor to meet this goal and get Pinball Paradise open.  Thank you so much for your time and help.  I really appreciate every one of you. Keep on Flippin’!!!</p>

My name is Andrew, i'm 32 years old and i'm from Israel. I've founded a small company named ""OGAT3d"", We specialize in 3D movies, 3D design and animation.
For games development the name will change to ""OGAT Entertainment"".

Three  3d modelers, two character animators, level  designer and programmer.

I and my small but experienced team  began to develop ""Dead Fault"" triple-A hardcore horror, CO-OP,first person view game for PC and next gen consoles (XBOX One, Playstation 4).  Game based on ""Unreal Engine 4"" and supports Virtual Reality (VR) technology for a total immersion in the atmosphere of the game!





We all grew on those games and movies like: ""Silent hill"" and the ""Evil Dead trilogy"", They all inspired us with its atmosphere!

  Because this is our dream! This is what we love, and we want to scare the c*** out of you! :))



Here some  of the game details:

Little part of the enemies models which will be used:





The game contains: bad language, gore, violence, sexual scenes, sliced body parts and many many more!

I currently live in Los Angeles, CA and am a student at Santa Monica College.</p><p>About 3 months ago, I had an exciting new idea for a business. I’d just returned a video game to GameStop and was frustrated that the money I got back was only a small percentage of what I paid for the game. I paid $60 when I bought the game and only received $20 when I returned it. I looked back over the years and realized that</p><p>I came out unsatisfied every time I returned a game to the store I bought it from. I was tired of not being fully compensated for my games, even when those games were released very recently.</p><p>The devaluation of most games in stores is very quick. Many games drop in price in less than 2 months after their release date.</p><p>That’s why I decided to start SaphFyre.</p><p> </p><p><u><strong>SaphFyre’s Effect On the Gaming Community</strong></u></p><p>See this?</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472258016/wuhlqa0vyoyzfpiili7u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>This is an example of the people at the top of the big corporations running game store chains. They are busy smiling with their calculators as they count all the extra money they have made off of average people like you and me.</p><p>On their way to the bank, they are laughing at how people are forced to continue buying games from their stores at full price and then return them for less than half the value.</p><p>Most games lose a significant amount of value in stores within two months of their release date. This leaves little time for users to try them out and decide whether they want to keep or return the games. If they need more time and decide to return a game, they will be forced to return it for a fraction of what they bought it for. Stores use this unfair method to add an extra boost to their already huge annual profits.</p><p>If you’ve ever bought and returned a video game before, you’ve likely been through this unsatisfying process.</p><p>Large corporations in the gaming and retail industry don’t care about giving their customers a good buying experience. The upward arrow is the only thing that matters to them, even if it means they will leave customers unsatisfied:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472258540/wb5wplmcguot5dmr9ee2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Gaming fanatics worldwide have been taken advantage of for far too long. This includes many children in middle and lower class families who spend a lot of time saving up to buy video games. If a child doesn’t like a game, they are forced to either keep it or return it for an insignificant amount of money. The money they get back is usually not enough to buy a replacement game to meet their needs.</p><p>These families work hard to ensure they and their children have comfort and recreation. However, their hard-earned money continues to go into the hands of greedy corporations who want to milk as many dollars out of them as they can. They keep buying games and cannot get back all, or even most, of the money they spent in the event of a return.</p><p>Gamers who want to buy games without waiting months for prices to drop have been left with no solution, until now. Our goal is to put a stop to this exploitation of gaming customers.</p><p>We want to create a service where gamers everywhere have a longer amount of time to try out their games before they lose value. If people choose not to keep a game, they have the option to be fully compensated for their games for a longer period of time. On SaphFyre, this period of time will be the 6 months following a specific game’s release date. This means that games will hold their high initial value for <strong>6 months</strong> before they are dropped to their lower store price.</p><p>SaphFyre will allow all gaming fanatics to get their full money’s worth in the event that they want to get rid of a game they don’t like. No more getting ripped off by the big-name stores!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><u><strong>How SaphFyre Works</strong></u></p><p>With a SaphFyre membership, you can try out a game for a long period of time to see if you want to keep it. If you choose not to keep the game, you will still have the opportunity to get your full money’s worth.</p><p>Instead of returning the game to a store and getting back a fraction of what you paid for it, you could bring it on SaphFyre for trade. The SaphFyre website, once completed, will allow all users to find other users who have put the games they want to receive out for trade. A user who puts out a game for trade will by fully compensated for their game in the form of other games.</p><p>For example, if you decide to trade a game that you paid $60 for at a store, you can trade that game for another game worth $60 on SaphFyre, two $30 games, a $45 game with a $15 game, and so on.</p><p>When putting a game out for trade, a member will make a public list of the game(s) they want in return for their game. This is so that users are only matched with people who are interested in the games they put out for trade and are willing to trade with them.</p><p>SaphFyre will have a user-friendly match-making system to facilitate users easily finding suitable trade partners. I hope to make this same service available for DVD and Blu-ray movies.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><u><strong>Avoid Scams With SaphFyre</strong></u></p><p>It is common for many trading services to suffer from a lot of scams. However, SaphFyre has a solution to this.</p><p>Once two members have agreed to a trade, each trader will directly ship the game to a shipping address provided by the other trader. SaphFyre will require that both users agree to receive their games on a specified date.</p><p>If one member does not follow through with their trade, that member’s account will be locked until they compensate the other user. The locked member will have the option to send the game they agreed to send or compensate the other user through a PayPal deposit.</p><p>This way, there is little motivation for users to attempt a scam and game-trading will be a simple, trusted process. People can trade their games without concern and have one less thing to worry about in their day-to-day lives.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472258800/xw0yhbwnxbnzdenfibo1.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Below is our plan for each member’s SaphFyre home page.

I currently live in Los Angeles, CA and am a student at Santa Monica College.About 3 months ago, I had an exciting new idea for a business. I’d just returned a video game to GameStop and was frustrated that the money I got back was only a small percentage of what I paid for the game. I paid $60 when I bought the game and only received $20 when I returned it. I looked back over the years and realized thatI came out unsatisfied every time I returned a game to the store I bought it from. I was tired of not being fully compensated for my games, even when those games were released very recently.The devaluation of most games in stores is very quick. Many games drop in price in less than 2 months after their release date.That’s why I decided to start SaphFyre. SaphFyre’s Effect On the Gaming CommunitySee this?This is an example of the people at the top of the big corporations running game store chains. They are busy smiling with their calculators as they count all the extra money they have made off of average people like you and me.On their way to the bank, they are laughing at how people are forced to continue buying games from their stores at full price and then return them for less than half the value.Most games lose a significant amount of value in stores within two months of their release date. This leaves little time for users to try them out and decide whether they want to keep or return the games. If they need more time and decide to return a game, they will be forced to return it for a fraction of what they bought it for. Stores use this unfair method to add an extra boost to their already huge annual profits.If you’ve ever bought and returned a video game before, you’ve likely been through this unsatisfying process.Large corporations in the gaming and retail industry don’t care about giving their customers a good buying experience. The upward arrow is the only thing that matters to them, even if it means they will leave customers unsatisfied:Gaming fanatics worldwide have been taken advantage of for far too long. This includes many children in middle and lower class families who spend a lot of time saving up to buy video games. If a child doesn’t like a game, they are forced to either keep it or return it for an insignificant amount of money. The money they get back is usually not enough to buy a replacement game to meet their needs.These families work hard to ensure they and their children have comfort and recreation. However, their hard-earned money continues to go into the hands of greedy corporations who want to milk as many dollars out of them as they can. They keep buying games and cannot get back all, or even most, of the money they spent in the event of a return.Gamers who want to buy games without waiting months for prices to drop have been left with no solution, until now. Our goal is to put a stop to this exploitation of gaming customers.We want to create a service where gamers everywhere have a longer amount of time to try out their games before they lose value. If people choose not to keep a game, they have the option to be fully compensated for their games for a longer period of time. On SaphFyre, this period of time will be the 6 months following a specific game’s release date. This means that games will hold their high initial value for 6 months before they are dropped to their lower store price.SaphFyre will allow all gaming fanatics to get their full money’s worth in the event that they want to get rid of a game they don’t like. No more getting ripped off by the big-name stores!  How SaphFyre WorksWith a SaphFyre membership, you can try out a game for a long period of time to see if you want to keep it. If you choose not to keep the game, you will still have the opportunity to get your full money’s worth.Instead of returning the game to a store and getting back a fraction of what you paid for it, you could bring it on SaphFyre for trade. The SaphFyre website, once completed, will allow all users to find other users who have put the games they want to receive out for trade. A user who puts out a game for trade will by fully compensated for their game in the form of other games.For example, if you decide to trade a game that you paid $60 for at a store, you can trade that game for another game worth $60 on SaphFyre, two $30 games, a $45 game with a $15 game, and so on.When putting a game out for trade, a member will make a public list of the game(s) they want in return for their game. This is so that users are only matched with people who are interested in the games they put out for trade and are willing to trade with them.SaphFyre will have a user-friendly match-making system to facilitate users easily finding suitable trade partners. I hope to make this same service available for DVD and Blu-ray movies.  Avoid Scams With SaphFyreIt is common for many trading services to suffer from a lot of scams. However, SaphFyre has a solution to this.Once two members have agreed to a trade, each trader will directly ship the game to a shipping address provided by the other trader. SaphFyre will require that both users agree to receive their games on a specified date.If one member does not follow through with their trade, that member’s account will be locked until they compensate the other user. The locked member will have the option to send the game they agreed to send or compensate the other user through a PayPal deposit.This way, there is little motivation for users to attempt a scam and game-trading will be a simple, trusted process. People can trade their games without concern and have one less thing to worry about in their day-to-day lives.             Below is our plan for each member’s SaphFyre home page. This is the first screen people will see when they log in:  Here is what a typical trading process will look like on SaphFyre:  What You Get In ReturnA complex e-commerce website, like SaphFyre, requires extensive web development. Think of websites like eBay and Amazon. These are websites that require a lot of development and troubleshooting to be created and maintained.The cost of creating a website like SaphFyre is typically much higher than your general, run-of-the-mill website that you can make on Weebly. That is why I hope to reach a goal of $50,000 in raised funds toward the development of SaphFyre.The purpose of raising funds is to hire professional web developers in order to create the website with all the proper features to ensure the satisfaction of future SaphFyre members.With your help, the SaphFyre website will be under development in the coming months. I hope to begin launch by late 2017.Your contributions will not go unnoticed! I am very grateful for any contribution you decide to make, regardless of the amount.There will be 6 Tiers of perks that are available for contributors. Tiers 1 thru 4 will be delivered to contributors by January 2017. Tiers 5 and 6 will be delivered to contributors after the SaphFyre website has been successfully funded and launched. We are estimating this time to be December 2017.  Perk Tiers 1, 2, and 3Tiers 1, 2, and 3 are mainly beneficial for contributors who would like to participate in the concept of game trading on SaphFyre and are considering being a future member of the website. These perks include free memberships and discounts. There will be two types of memberships on SaphFyre, Regular and Premium. Both membership types are offered for a variety of different time periods, depending on what the user chooses. Here are the options for future SaphFyre Membership:  Perk Tiers 4, 5, and 6There will also be perks that will recognize contributors and allow people to see how much they’ve helped me accomplish my goal. These perks consist of social media shout-outs, a “Thank You” note, and a SaphFyre webpage and video listing and recognizing all contributors as appreciation.  No Matter the Final Number, We’ll Keep SaphFyre GoingEven if we do not reach our final goal of $50,000, I will contact web developers and have them begin work on the SaphFyre e-commerce website.Without reaching our full goal, we may have to cut some of the features that we planned to add to the SaphFyre website. For example, we may have to wait longer until we add the movie trading feature or a Reward Center to the website. Please note that if this occurs, we may have to temporarily cancel Perk Tier 3 until a later time.However, I will use any amount that I receive from your contributions for the development of the website, even if it means that some features will be limited and the website will be more basic in its early stages.  I Can’t Do It AloneI truly believe that SaphFyre will be a major contributor to the satisfaction of the gaming community, a real game changer. This is a concept that will appeal to many people who love video games.However, I need your help to make SaphFyre a reality.I am putting a lot of faith into this project and hope that, with your help, I can begin my career as an aspiring entrepreneur, looking to contribute and make the world a better place.SaphFyre is a service that would be helpful to gaming fanatics all around the globe. It would put an end to the lack of satisfaction one gets when returning a game to the store.Please contribute to this campaign if you want to help me achieve my goal of improving the gaming experience for people worldwide!  Risks & Challenges In The Business WorldI have been passionate about being an entrepreneur since I was very young.

<p>Hi! We are a group of larp players and designers from Poland and
Denmark. And here is our campaign: by larpers, for larpers. We have
started it with the prospect of new scenarios being created: better,
more interesting, and more polished than ever before. And so that all
of us (yes, you too!) can play them later. :)</p>
<p>We are gathering funds to finish Spindle – an app supporting
larp writing in all of its stages, from designing the plot to
printing out elaborate character sheets. Spindle is a tool which will
let Game Masters from all over the world create larps faster, more
efficiently, and with less editing-related mistakes. That also
includes you, as well as the authors of your favourite game!</p>
<p>During the campaign you may buy larp tickets with a discount (and
give their authors access to Spindle), get Spindle for your own
projects, or simply support the idea of creating mistake-free games.</p>

Such a subscription gives authors the access to various functions customized for their games.</p><p>Every larp ticket bought during the campaign will not only be cheaper, but it will also give the authors who donated it an advanced, month-long subscription to Spindle. This way you can help the authors by making it easier for them: they can create the game using the app in 2016, which means the upcoming larp season will be pretty exciting!</p><p>By supporting this campaign you support well-written larps – and the whole community</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449165762/auqjlejljpdnyqss7mau.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p><p></p><p> You all must be wondering: how does Spindle work and look like, exactly?

  ACTION-ADVENTURE</h3>
<img align=""right"" alt=""Zombie &amp; Nazi Free"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadlymatter.com/external/Gogo/zombienazifreegarantee.png"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:24px;margin-left:24px;border:none;""/>
<p>The world is ruled by a secret society called the <strong>Illuminati</strong>. For a long time they have been working on a global master plan to decimate the human population with the goal to create something they called ""a new balance"". Their latest project involves the mass production of <strong>antimatter</strong> in secret underground laboratories, which is used to create weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" alt=""DeadlyMatter Alex"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadlymatter.com/external/Gogo/Alex.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>You will step into the role of Alex, who's task is to prevent the production of antimatter by sabotaging the facilities and extract the source material: gold. Because these secret underground facilities are hidden from the outside world, you'll have to find them first. As they are spread all over the world, some locations like the <strong>Crimea</strong> (Black Sea) and <strong>Sinai</strong> (Egypt) are pretty challenging to visit.</p>
<p>While you're making your journey through areas that can be hostile or closed off, you'll need to make certain decisions about using violence to complete the quests. As in real life, aggression is noted and the area with its people (NPCs), will respond to that accordingly. As Alex, you'll not be be able to solely shoot your way through, <strong>stealth</strong> or diplomacy and problem-solving without violence are also crucial to finish the mission.</p>
<p>The organization that is sending you off to these far locations will back you up financially and technically, but demand certain things in return. At some point you will wonder if all the things that you do are as noble as one thought they would be.</p>

<h3>FEATURES &amp; MECHANICS</h3>
<h4>
<img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadlymatter.com/external/Gogo/DeadlyMatter_Prototype.png"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:24px;margin-left:24px;""/>» OPEN WORLD</h4>
<p>There's really not that much strict linearity found in DeadlyMatter, you'll be able to roam free within the boundaries of the map. The given quests will bring you to various locations, but often you'll decide how and when to get there. All buildings and structures can be explored, though some areas might be sealed until certain quests are completed.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadlymatter.com/external/Gogo/DM_Gogo_Screen_Run.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:24px;margin-top:24px;""/></p>
<h4>» REAL WORLD LOCATIONS</h4>
<p>We are very keen on replicating real world locations in DeadlyMatter <strong>as accurate as possible</strong>. It's very likely that if you enter a certain building in DeadlyMatter you'll be able to trace it back in virtual globe/map application like Google Earth or in real life. Our first map release will be a representation of 16km² of the Crimean Peninsula at the Black Sea, including; mountainous terrain, vast grasslands, forests, small to medium sized towns, industrial areas, highways and a sea port.</p>
<p><img alt=""DeadlyMatter Screenshot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadlymatter.com/external/Gogo/DM_Gogo_Screen_Garden.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:24px;margin-top:24px;""/></p>
<h4>» THIRD &amp; FIRST PERSON</h4>
<p>DeadlyMatter can be played in third-person and first-person, with a mouse &amp; keyboard or a controller.</p>
<h4>» HEALTH SYSTEM</h4>
<p>Control not only health &amp; stamina, but also blood level, blood sugar level, hydration, stomach content, oxygen saturation and endurance. Only eating &amp; drinking to stay alive is not enough, you'll also need to take care of what you're eating and drinking; food &amp; drinks contain water, carbs, proteins and vitamins. A balanced diet results in a healthier and fitter avatar and certain food will help to heal injuries faster.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadlymatter.com/external/Gogo/DM_Gogo_Screen_Raid.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:24px;margin-top:24px;""/></p>
<h4>» VEHICLES</h4>
<p>Vehicles play an important role in DeadlyMatter. Avoiding walking long distances is one thing, but you're also able to move things from one place to another (as a movable stash). For now the only maintenance a car needs is fuel, but this may be further developed when the demand is there. Driving a vehicle can be done with keyboard, mouse &amp; keyboard or a controller.</p>
<p><img alt=""DeadlyMatter Screenshot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadlymatter.com/external/Gogo/DM_Gogo_Screen_Car.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:24px;margin-top:24px;""/></p>
<h4>» WEAPONS</h4>
<p>You'll find and use all kinds of weapons in DeadlyMatter. Not only firearms and melee weapons, but also poison or hand crafted explosion devices. Simple weapon customization will be available and can only be done at certain locations on the map.</p>
<p><img alt=""DeadlyMatter Shotgun"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadlymatter.com/external/Gogo/DM_Gogo_Shotgun.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:24px;margin-top:24px;""/></p>
<h4>» NPC INTERACTION</h4>
<p>Interacting with NPCs by using the RPG-style dialogue system is an important part of the game play in DeadlyMatter.</p>
<p><img alt=""DeadlyMatter Screenshot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadlymatter.com/external/Gogo/DM_Gogo_Screen_Talk.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:24px;margin-top:24px;""/></p>
<h4>» CRAFTING</h4>
<p>A simple crafting system will be implemented and vary from creating poisonous food to hand-crafted explosion devices.</p>
<h4>» BUYING OR LOOTING</h4>
<p>You can loot buildings for food and weapons, but expect habitants defending their property. Or you can buy your necessities, and avoid getting shot at or be wanted by police.</p>
<p><img alt=""DeadlyMatter Screenshot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadlymatter.com/external/Gogo/DM_Gogo_Screen_Inventory.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:24px;margin-top:24px;""/></p>
<h4>» INVENTORY SYSTEM</h4>
<p>A simple inventory system keeps your stuff at hand, though don't expect to be able to put a whole arsenal in your backpack. The use of stashes around the map or vehicles can overcome the limitations of the size of your carried inventory.</p>
<h4>» ENGINE</h4>
<p>We have been developing our own custom engine (Momentum), which is originally based on the open source game engine Torque 3D. As we have full control over the source does it serve DeadlyMatter well enough, but on the other hand takes it huge efforts to keep it updated with present-day standards and technologies. If we manage to get enough budget then we will make an attempt to migrate DeadlyMatter to a different game engine. This will greatly improve performance as well render quality, but also create support for multiple platforms. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadlymatter.com/external/Gogo/DM_Gogo_Screen_Rays.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:24px;margin-top:24px;""/></p>
<h3>MULTIPLAYER OPEN WORLD SHOOTER</h3>
<p>Be a lone wolf or create and join factions on maps that represent real world locations. Take up arms, or be stealthy and sneaky in order to win the missions.</p>
<p><strong><img align=""right"" alt=""DeadlyMatter AMC"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadlymatter.com/external/Gogo/DM_Gogo_AMC.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:24px;margin-top:24px;""/></strong>The main quests of the multiplayer missions mostly involve antimatter. This material is extremely explosive and <strong>will wipe out the whole map</strong> if it detonates due to shocking or damaging the antimatter containers (traps). So one needs to be careful when handling a weapon or explosive near, or driving a truck loaded with these containers, because everybody loses when it all goes wrong.</p>
<p>Beside main quests will there be side quests that may unlock weapons or vehicles within the mission when achieved. It's not mandatory to take up any quest; you can explore and stay alive in an open world with or without joining or battling against other players.</p>
<p><strong>This part will only developed with more then 50% funding</strong>!</p>

We are extremely enthusiastic in what we do and have the drive to make it the finished and independently developed game even without the money! Though the lack of any budget forces us to take jobs and projects that provide us the monthly income to make a living; this keeps on delaying the development of DeadlyMatter. Further does the lack of budget have consequences for the quality of the game, as we would like to hire the people that are specialized in certain fields of profession this game needs.</p>

<h3>WHY WOULD YOU FUND THIS GAME?</h3>
<p>If you look closely you'll see there aren't that many games that are similar to DeadlyMatter. Especially as an indie-game it will stand out with its unique combination of game mechanics. Surely there are AAA games out there that do share the same kind of concepts, but as an independent developer we will have certainly less restrictions in the art direction and storyline. Furthermore are we working with a small team and anyone who's interested or involved in DeadlyMatter will be able to directly contact us with questions, comments or requests.</p>
<p>From a player's point of view you might be interested getting your hands on another game that's somewhat in-line with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Wikipedia"">Half-Life</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.T.A.L.K.E.R.:_Shadow_of_Chernobyl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Wikipedia"">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</a>. DeadlyMatter will certainly give you a different experience, but it will contain similar elements; and we're absolutely convinced there aren't enough games that do nowadays! Hopefully you are to, then <strong>this is the game for you!</strong></p>

<h3>OUR STRECHED GOALS</h3>
<p>Our $100.000 goal will be mainly used to get you <strong>play DeadlyMatter on Steam as quickly as possible</strong>. We really don't want to keep you waiting for years until it's all finished so we going to release is as an early access game. To get DeadlyMatter fully developed according our initial plans without making compromises and within a reasonable time scope; we  would need more than that. We will focus on the here &amp; now first and be realistic in what can be achieved. Indiegogo can be the opportunity for us to accelerate the development process, extend and <strong>improve the quality</strong> of the game. Every dollar on top the initial goal will speed up the development time, contribute to more features and better graphics.</p>
<p><img alt=""DeadlyMatter Screenshot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadlymatter.com/external/Gogo/DM_Gogo_Screen_Hunt.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:24px;margin-top:24px;""/></p>
<h3>WHAT IF WE DON'T REACH OUR GOAL?</h3>
<p><img align=""right"" alt=""We have a prototype"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadlymatter.com/external/Gogo/DeadlyMatter_Prototype.png"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:24px;margin-left:24px;""/>We have chosen for flexible funding because this game is already pretty far in development and <strong>we have a working prototype</strong>. With less budget we will be able to eventually release the game, but the quality and its features will be different from what we are trying to achieve. All the <strong>perks will be delivered regardless the outcome of this campaign</strong>. DeadlyMatter will then most likely not be migrated to a different game engine (with less then 100k funding). Further would it reduce the chance of of being released to Steam; the game will then be distributed as single player for Windows PC only.</p>
<h3>REFUND</h3>
<p>If the amount of funding turns out much too low and/or the team won't be able to finish this project properly before the delivery date, then we will offer a refund to all the backers. Note that physical perks like t-shirts, stickers etc. aren't included and the amount may differ.</p>

<h3>DEVELOPMENT PLAN</h3>
<h4>» 2015 AND STEAM GREENLIGHT</h4>
<p>DeadlyMatter <strong>has been Greenlit</strong> on Steam last year in 12 days, on #8 with 74% yes votes.</p>
<p><img alt=""DeadlyMatter Steam"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadlymatter.com/external/Gogo/DM_Gogo_SteamStats.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:24px;margin-top:24px;""/></p>
<p>2015 was also a year that some amount of games that were released as early access and didn't meet up with the expectations of players. We raised our standards and went on further developing the game, but also further developing the game engine; with the goal to get a decent working product. Bug fixing and optimization are high priority but also truly demand a lot of time and effort.</p>
<p><strong>The reality of indie game development:</strong> Due to circumstances were we unable to work full-time on this project. We had to take on jobs and unrelated projects to make a living for our selves. Despite our immense devotion is it impossible to realize this project <strong>fully</strong>, while working part-time, <strong>within a reasonable scope</strong> and without any budget.</p>
<h4>» ROADMAP 2016-2018</h4>
<p>The estimation of the time of delivery of any game is pretty tricky when working with a small team. If we're going to reach stretched goals with our campaign, then things will be done faster because we would be able to expand our team. But when we need to say goodbye to team members and/or we don't have enough budget; the development may be delayed. Therefore are the dates in the road-map below a rough estimation.</p>
<p><img alt=""DeadlyMatter Roadmap"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadlymatter.com/external/Gogo/DM_Gogo_Roadmap.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:24px;margin-top:24px;""/></p>
<h3>SO HOW WILL THIS MONEY BE USED?</h3>
<p>We truly wished that 100% of the funding would go into development. But this is not the case as you can see in the diagram below:</p>
<p><img alt=""DeadlyMatter where it goes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadlymatter.com/external/Gogo/DM_Gogo_Budget.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:24px;margin-top:24px;""/></p>
<p>This is a rough estimation! It's a daunting task to predict how much tax we paid after a year; so is the prediction of the production costs of the perks. The main goal for this campaign is to get you to play DeadlyMatter as quickly as possible; therefore all the funding that goes into ""Development"" will serve this goal.</p>

As long as I can remember I'm into to game design; starting off with board games since when I was able to draw; and stepped over to the digital realm when I got my hands on my first computer: a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Wikipedia"">Commodore 64</a>. After the introduction of the PC I was completely hooked and the plans to build games never left my head ever since. I'm born &amp; raised in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Wikipedia"">the Netherlands</a> but I'm living in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Wikipedia"">Shanghai</a> (China) for almost 7 years now. I studied graphic design at the academy of art and ended my career as art director before I started my private company and left my fatherland in 2009.</p>
<p>The idea for DeadlyMatter originated in 2012 but it started to get shape after 2 years of preparation (including development the storyline). I wanted to synthesize my passions for open world &amp; adventure games, science &amp; fiction and ancient events &amp; places <strong>into one big world</strong> with a storyline, that not only will amaze you once you're in it, but also triggers you to be the researcher &amp; explorer like I am. It's my ultimate drive to create <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Wikipedia"">hermetic</a> world and capture you in it for a moment in time, giving you an experience to remember without locking you up or holding you down. Here is where my passion for game development will shine and here is where my adverse for linearity will show. I'll will always make an attempt to not only give you the freedom to roam within what's possible to build, but also try to <strong>give you the control</strong> over time as well (whenever it's feasible).</p>
<p>Except for the serious coding part and animations, are the most<strong>¹</strong> things you see &amp; hear in DeadlyMatter coming from my head, hands and mouth. As a control freak and disciplined workaholic I'll have a hand in everything regarding this project, but also have true respect for professionals that do their things better then me.</p>

The size of the team varies from time to time, but it always remained to be small and dynamic. As team members &amp; partners come and go, I'll stay on this ""ship"" under any circumstance. If it happens to sink, then I'll go under with it, no question about it. To make this project a success we need devoted team members, but we also need you!!!</p>
<p>Holding up my hand was never my thing. I believe in hard work and earning the things in life without taking advantage of anyone. The development of the game has taken so long up till no, because of that belief; and I worked on projects that were not related to gaming, just to keep the business going. A crowd funding campaign like this only crossed my mind, because it's essential now in order to complete the game with its initial concept.</p>
<p>I believe in a fair &amp; <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Wikipedia"">sustainable</a> business without exploiting or harm anyone or the environment.

<h4>» ANTIMATTER TRAP (CONTAINER)</h4>
<p>A antimatter trap is a container designed to hold antimatter material within a force field. For DeadlyMatter we developed a portable trap to make it able to transport antimatter (in the game!). It’s made from robust metal, glass, ceramic and polymer material components and it holds a battery as a power backup. It’s one of the icons from the game, so for our dearest backer are we going to have one made as an awesome wannahave.</p>

<p><strong>AMT Mark I : A real sized antimatter trap</strong></p>
<p> A 1:1 model of the antimatter trap made from metal, glass, ceramic and polymeric materials. It contains a glowing light source that runs on a rechargeable battery (power cable included). A  shock warning system will be installed to give an audio signal when the container receives sudden shocks or when the power cable gets disconnected. The trap comes with a wooden crate, suitable for shipping, a quick reference guide and a user manual.</p>

</p></div>","STORY DRIVEN OPEN WORLD 
  ACTION-ADVENTURE

The world is ruled by a secret society called the Illuminati. For a long time they have been working on a global master plan to decimate the human population with the goal to create something they called ""a new balance"". Their latest project involves the mass production of antimatter in secret underground laboratories, which is used to create weapons of mass destruction.
You will step into the role of Alex, who's task is to prevent the production of antimatter by sabotaging the facilities and extract the source material: gold. Because these secret underground facilities are hidden from the outside world, you'll have to find them first. As they are spread all over the world, some locations like the Crimea (Black Sea) and Sinai (Egypt) are pretty challenging to visit.
While you're making your journey through areas that can be hostile or closed off, you'll need to make certain decisions about using violence to complete the quests. As in real life, aggression is noted and the area with its people (NPCs), will respond to that accordingly. As Alex, you'll not be be able to solely shoot your way through, stealth or diplomacy and problem-solving without violence are also crucial to finish the mission.
The organization that is sending you off to these far locations will back you up financially and technically, but demand certain things in return. At some point you will wonder if all the things that you do are as noble as one thought they would be.


FEATURES & MECHANICS

» OPEN WORLD
There's really not that much strict linearity found in DeadlyMatter, you'll be able to roam free within the boundaries of the map. The given quests will bring you to various locations, but often you'll decide how and when to get there. All buildings and structures can be explored, though some areas might be sealed until certain quests are completed.

» REAL WORLD LOCATIONS
We are very keen on replicating real world locations in DeadlyMatter as accurate as possible. It's very likely that if you enter a certain building in DeadlyMatter you'll be able to trace it back in virtual globe/map application like Google Earth or in real life. Our first map release will be a representation of 16km² of the Crimean Peninsula at the Black Sea, including; mountainous terrain, vast grasslands, forests, small to medium sized towns, industrial areas, highways and a sea port.

» THIRD & FIRST PERSON
DeadlyMatter can be played in third-person and first-person, with a mouse & keyboard or a controller.
» HEALTH SYSTEM
Control not only health & stamina, but also blood level, blood sugar level, hydration, stomach content, oxygen saturation and endurance. Only eating & drinking to stay alive is not enough, you'll also need to take care of what you're eating and drinking; food & drinks contain water, carbs, proteins and vitamins. A balanced diet results in a healthier and fitter avatar and certain food will help to heal injuries faster.

» VEHICLES
Vehicles play an important role in DeadlyMatter. Avoiding walking long distances is one thing, but you're also able to move things from one place to another (as a movable stash). For now the only maintenance a car needs is fuel, but this may be further developed when the demand is there. Driving a vehicle can be done with keyboard, mouse & keyboard or a controller.

» WEAPONS
You'll find and use all kinds of weapons in DeadlyMatter. Not only firearms and melee weapons, but also poison or hand crafted explosion devices. Simple weapon customization will be available and can only be done at certain locations on the map.

» NPC INTERACTION
Interacting with NPCs by using the RPG-style dialogue system is an important part of the game play in DeadlyMatter.

» CRAFTING
A simple crafting system will be implemented and vary from creating poisonous food to hand-crafted explosion devices.
» BUYING OR LOOTING
You can loot buildings for food and weapons, but expect habitants defending their property. Or you can buy your necessities, and avoid getting shot at or be wanted by police.

» INVENTORY SYSTEM
A simple inventory system keeps your stuff at hand, though don't expect to be able to put a whole arsenal in your backpack. The use of stashes around the map or vehicles can overcome the limitations of the size of your carried inventory.
» ENGINE
We have been developing our own custom engine (Momentum), which is originally based on the open source game engine Torque 3D. As we have full control over the source does it serve DeadlyMatter well enough, but on the other hand takes it huge efforts to keep it updated with present-day standards and technologies. If we manage to get enough budget then we will make an attempt to migrate DeadlyMatter to a different game engine. This will greatly improve performance as well render quality, but also create support for multiple platforms. 
MULTIPLAYER OPEN WORLD SHOOTER
Be a lone wolf or create and join factions on maps that represent real world locations. Take up arms, or be stealthy and sneaky in order to win the missions.
The main quests of the multiplayer missions mostly involve antimatter. This material is extremely explosive and will wipe out the whole map if it detonates due to shocking or damaging the antimatter containers (traps). So one needs to be careful when handling a weapon or explosive near, or driving a truck loaded with these containers, because everybody loses when it all goes wrong.
Beside main quests will there be side quests that may unlock weapons or vehicles within the mission when achieved. It's not mandatory to take up any quest; you can explore and stay alive in an open world with or without joining or battling against other players.
This part will only developed with more then 50% funding!







 
WHY INDIEGOGO?
For some time we have been developing DeadlyMatter without any budget. We are extremely enthusiastic in what we do and have the drive to make it the finished and independently developed game even without the money! Though the lack of any budget forces us to take jobs and projects that provide us the monthly income to make a living; this keeps on delaying the development of DeadlyMatter. Further does the lack of budget have consequences for the quality of the game, as we would like to hire the people that are specialized in certain fields of profession this game needs.
  
Your direct support is needed to:

expand our team and get more things done
get us to work on the game full-time

speed up the development
migrate to a different game engine
release DeadlyMatter to Windows PC and Linux PC (Mac OS and Xbox are stretched goals)
add VR support

add multiplayer map(s) and set up servers
get proper first person characters modeled & rigged
replace and extend animations

replace and add more vehicles

polish up the graphics and improve quality

develop AI and add more NPCs
hire a freelance writer and voice actors

improve and extend the inventory system

get it on Steam as early access

collect the rest of the additional budget with sales on Steam


 

WHY WOULD YOU FUND THIS GAME?
If you look closely you'll see there aren't that many games that are similar to DeadlyMatter. Especially as an indie-game it will stand out with its unique combination of game mechanics. Surely there are AAA games out there that do share the same kind of concepts, but as an independent developer we will have certainly less restrictions in the art direction and storyline. Furthermore are we working with a small team and anyone who's interested or involved in DeadlyMatter will be able to directly contact us with questions, comments or requests.
From a player's point of view you might be interested getting your hands on another game that's somewhat in-line with Half-Life or S.T.A.L.K.E.R.. DeadlyMatter will certainly give you a different experience, but it will contain similar elements; and we're absolutely convinced there aren't enough games that do nowadays! Hopefully you are to, then this is the game for you!

OUR STRECHED GOALS
Our $100.000 goal will be mainly used to get you play DeadlyMatter on Steam as quickly as possible. We really don't want to keep you waiting for years until it's all finished so we going to release is as an early access game. To get DeadlyMatter fully developed according our initial plans without making compromises and within a reasonable time scope; we  would need more than that. We will focus on the here & now first and be realistic in what can be achieved. Indiegogo can be the opportunity for us to accelerate the development process, extend and improve the quality of the game. Every dollar on top the initial goal will speed up the development time, contribute to more features and better graphics.

WHAT IF WE DON'T REACH OUR GOAL?
We have chosen for flexible funding because this game is already pretty far in development and we have a working prototype. With less budget we will be able to eventually release the game, but the quality and its features will be different from what we are trying to achieve. All the perks will be delivered regardless the outcome of this campaign. DeadlyMatter will then most likely not be migrated to a different game engine (with less then 100k funding). Further would it reduce the chance of of being released to Steam; the game will then be distributed as single player for Windows PC only.
REFUND
If the amount of funding turns out much too low and/or the team won't be able to finish this project properly before the delivery date, then we will offer a refund to all the backers. Note that physical perks like t-shirts, stickers etc. aren't included and the amount may differ.








 
DEVELOPMENT PLAN
» 2015 AND STEAM GREENLIGHT
DeadlyMatter has been Greenlit on Steam last year in 12 days, on #8 with 74% yes votes.

2015 was also a year that some amount of games that were released as early access and didn't meet up with the expectations of players. We raised our standards and went on further developing the game, but also further developing the game engine; with the goal to get a decent working product. Bug fixing and optimization are high priority but also truly demand a lot of time and effort.
The reality of indie game development: Due to circumstances were we unable to work full-time on this project. We had to take on jobs and unrelated projects to make a living for our selves. Despite our immense devotion is it impossible to realize this project fully, while working part-time, within a reasonable scope and without any budget.
» ROADMAP 2016-2018
The estimation of the time of delivery of any game is pretty tricky when working with a small team. If we're going to reach stretched goals with our campaign, then things will be done faster because we would be able to expand our team. But when we need to say goodbye to team members and/or we don't have enough budget; the development may be delayed. Therefore are the dates in the road-map below a rough estimation.

SO HOW WILL THIS MONEY BE USED?
We truly wished that 100% of the funding would go into development. But this is not the case as you can see in the diagram below:

This is a rough estimation! It's a daunting task to predict how much tax we paid after a year; so is the prediction of the production costs of the perks. The main goal for this campaign is to get you to play DeadlyMatter as quickly as possible; therefore all the funding that goes into ""Development"" will serve this goal.






 
WHO IS WE?
I am Nils Eikeleboom, the father of this game and the founder of Studio DimSum. As long as I can remember I'm into to game design; starting off with board games since when I was able to draw; and stepped over to the digital realm when I got my hands on my first computer: a Commodore 64. After the introduction of the PC I was completely hooked and the plans to build games never left my head ever since. I'm born & raised in the Netherlands but I'm living in Shanghai (China) for almost 7 years now. I studied graphic design at the academy of art and ended my career as art director before I started my private company and left my fatherland in 2009.
The idea for DeadlyMatter originated in 2012 but it started to get shape after 2 years of preparation (including development the storyline). I wanted to synthesize my passions for open world & adventure games, science & fiction and ancient events & places into one big world with a storyline, that not only will amaze you once you're in it, but also triggers you to be the researcher & explorer like I am. It's my ultimate drive to create hermetic world and capture you in it for a moment in time, giving you an experience to remember without locking you up or holding you down. Here is where my passion for game development will shine and here is where my adverse for linearity will show. I'll will always make an attempt to not only give you the freedom to roam within what's possible to build, but also try to give you the control over time as well (whenever it's feasible).
Except for the serious coding part and animations, are the most¹ things you see & hear in DeadlyMatter coming from my head, hands and mouth. As a control freak and disciplined workaholic I'll have a hand in everything regarding this project, but also have true respect for professionals that do their things better then me.

[Shanghai by night]
I'm gladly working together with other professionals, and I'm very grateful we're building this together. The size of the team varies from time to time, but it always remained to be small and dynamic. As team members & partners come and go, I'll stay on this ""ship"" under any circumstance. If it happens to sink, then I'll go under with it, no question about it. To make this project a success we need devoted team members, but we also need you!!!
Holding up my hand was never my thing. I believe in hard work and earning the things in life without taking advantage of anyone. The development of the game has taken so long up till no, because of that belief; and I worked on projects that were not related to gaming, just to keep the business going. A crowd funding campaign like this only crossed my mind, because it's essential now in order to complete the game with its initial concept.
I believe in a fair & sustainable business without exploiting or harm anyone or the environment. I refuse to do business with parties that are involved in gambling or illegal activities, exploit people or the environment, or conduct their biz in a unsustainable way. In DeadlyMatter I'll let you take up against the Illuminati; this is also how I stand in my personal ""real"" life.

» IN-GAME BILLBOARD
Lease your own in-game billboard for your brand, company, group (such as a band etc.) or as a individual. Each map will contain 100 billboards and the ads are displayed randomly each time a new day starts. To make sure the style is in-line with the game, will the ads be designed by a professional graphic designer with years of experience in marketing communications. We will make sure your brand or corporate identity is implemented accordingly and offer 3 different design proposals to choose from. The duration of the lease contract will be 365 days, starting from the 1st day of appearance in the official beta release of DeadlyMatter.

Read & understand this before getting this perk: We will not add advertising for criminal, political, religious, unethical or highly unsustainable organizations or individuals. We will certainly not advertise for companies or people that are involved in gambling, controlled substances, abuse of people and animals, pollution, suppression or any other unethical activities. This page is not the place for all the legal and other details, so please contact us for further information before getting this perk now. We will conduct a screening when we think it's necessary. Refunds after refusal by us are only paid within 30 days after the campaign ends, and the amount will be reduced with the costs of Indiegogo and money transfers.
 
» ANTIMATTER TRAP (CONTAINER)
A antimatter trap is a container designed to hold antimatter material within a force field. For DeadlyMatter we developed a portable trap to make it able to transport antimatter (in the game!). It’s made from robust metal, glass, ceramic and polymer material components and it holds a battery as a power backup. It’s one of the icons from the game, so for our dearest backer are we going to have one made as an awesome wannahave.

AMT Mark I : A real sized antimatter trap
 A 1:1 model of the antimatter trap made from metal, glass, ceramic and polymeric materials. It contains a glowing light source that runs on a rechargeable battery (power cable included). A  shock warning system will be installed to give an audio signal when the container receives sudden shocks or when the power cable gets disconnected. The trap comes with a wooden crate, suitable for shipping, a quick reference guide and a user manual.
Please contact us for more details!

WARNING: These traps are not tested with antimatter material. Do not use these containers to store any antimatter, nor bring it in contact with. You’re strongly advised only to use these objects for decoration / show-off purposes only. We cannot be held responsible for any catastrophe, disaster or damage caused directly or indirectly by these objects and/or its content whatsoever.






  

RISKS
Understand that the development of a video game is a risky business. We have managed to keep on developing without any budget for some time now, but we cannot look into the future. As with any business are there numerous factors that can have a big influence on the development and/or delivery time, as well can lead (for example) bankruptcy, sickness or death to termination of this project.
A video game is software and may contain bugs or cause issues on specific operating systems and/or with specific hardware. It's not 100% guaranteed that DeadlyMatter can/will run on your computer or console.
Further understand that the delivery of rewards or perks are subject to best efforts and not guaranteed.

The company first started in 2014 when two of us participated in Epic's (company which created Unreal Engine) GameJam contests and signed ourselves as 'Solux Interactive'. We created 5 non-commercial games but never distributed them as they generally required some effort to finish. In June 2017 Dmytro '<i>haarer0</i>' Korniienko (founder and programmer) and Artem '<i>rutto</i>' Korniienko (3D artist) decided to focus only on game development full time. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509460434/rcrl9weygkd5kbmatuad.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;width: 150px;margin:10px 0 10px 10px;""/>Vlad '<i>amHvost</i>' Zabela (game designer) then joined the team and brought with him some fresh ideas for future development.  We were also joined by a 2D artist (Vitalii '<i>Felix</i>' Lukianenko), and another 3D artist (Oleg '<i>Linch</i>' Kovalenko). <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509459886/at6y1ricpvl8rginqpep.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;width: 150px;margin:10px 10px 10px 0;""/>Once we have relocated to an office, we decided to stream the whole development process on streaming platforms.

In this game the player controls an ethereal spirit, protecting the Elder Tree from evil creatures.</p><p>Inspired by the latest news about researching space and plans of colonization of Mars in the near future, we picked up sci-fi terraforming as a theme for the new game. We truly believe mankind may land and establish an extra-terrestrial colony soon and want to highlight this topic to people in any way we can. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509460840/titea3ckgxkmr9ll9szk.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;width: 150px;margin:10px 10px 10px 0;""/>We had a lot of internal conversations trying to predict how terraforming might look. What should be done and which technologies would be used to achieve that? In our opinion, the terraforming should happen in a few waves -</p><ul>
<li>exploration &amp; reconnaissance,</li>
<li>probing,</li>
<li>initial part of terraforming process (which involves manned and unmanned robots operating in hostile environment)</li>
<li>a final phase, when humans can land on the ground and complete the process on the surface.</li>
</ul><p>The word ""Ecopoiesis"" itself ( from the Greek οἶκος [oikos] - ""house"", and ποίησις [poiesis] - ""production"") was suggested by famous biophysicist Robert Haynes. He described this word as ""a fabrication of a sustainable ecosystem on a currently lifeless, sterile planet"" by making some primary engineering and biological processes in order to complete the initial part of terraforming. Our game focuses on this, 'Ecopoiesis' part. </p><p>You can read more about the game below.</p><h2>

</h2><h3>Campaign goals</h3><p>We want to be completely transparent by explaining the campaign goals. This is all about money (as are all the other projects on IndieGoGo). Each month we need to pay a rent for our office, pay for internet, obtain required software, pay subscriptions for different SaaS products (such as Jira/Confluence, etc). None of us have other income and our initial funding is dwindling. This creates issues as we cannot complete development, invest in hardware or software or meet other financial commitments.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509545178/skh0bipeclbmltptvgio.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Helping us get to as little as US $10,000 (and more is better!) will enable us to survive, thrive and make a successful release of our first commercial game on Steam.</p><h3> </h3><h3>
<br/>Reasons</h3><p>As this game is the first commercial project by our combined team, we are faced with simple and quite obvious issues (now they are obvious). The main reason we have used up most of our initial funding was the developing process itself, which took more time as expected. This caused by a several reasons all of which we have learnt from:</p><ul>
<li>Underestimating the time to complete complex modelling and programming tasks.</li>
<li>Driven by our desire to make the process more educable by streaming everything and setting it all up took away from the time we could devote to development which was further impacted by explaining the game creation.</li>
<li>Lengthy exploration and discussion on how to make things more ‘realistic’ from a science point of view but still gamified.</li>
<li><p>As we are not astrophysicists or even space engineers with a background to prove all our ideas, we are always open for further discussions of how to improve storytelling or in-game terraforming processes.</p></li>
</ul><h3>
<br/>Risks</h3><p>At this moment we have a playable beta version of the game with one planet and 5 finished levels and full gameplay. Later we will put it on Steam and send keys for closed beta to our backers (US $15+). Ecopoiesis will be released with one planet and 20 levels in mid-January. If we receive support from you we may implement more planets (with different gameplays) and more in-game mechanics. It also means we get to keep our development space and keep the team members together.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Work to do</h3><p>As mentioned above, our main goal is to release the game on Steam with appropriate quality as soon as possible. In addition, and if you can help support us, we plan to:</p><ul>
<li>Add controllers support</li>
<li>Add new mission types<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509460916/vvbdsjggak9gdbvy8nki.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;width: 150px;margin:10px 0 10px 10px;""/>

Neil deGrasse Tyson
Solux Interactive is an independent game developer company from Kyiv, Ukraine. The company first started in 2014 when two of us participated in Epic's (company which created Unreal Engine) GameJam contests and signed ourselves as 'Solux Interactive'. We created 5 non-commercial games but never distributed them as they generally required some effort to finish. In June 2017 Dmytro 'haarer0' Korniienko (founder and programmer) and Artem 'rutto' Korniienko (3D artist) decided to focus only on game development full time. Vlad 'amHvost' Zabela (game designer) then joined the team and brought with him some fresh ideas for future development.  We were also joined by a 2D artist (Vitalii 'Felix' Lukianenko), and another 3D artist (Oleg 'Linch' Kovalenko). Once we have relocated to an office, we decided to stream the whole development process on streaming platforms. Anastasia 'Siia' Didenko joined the team, as a community manager and director of our streaming channels on Twitch, Youtube, Periscope and LiveEdu. After some discussion, the team decided to start working on one of our earlier GameJam prototypes - a game called 'Eternal Forest' (can be downloaded here, however please keep in mind this game was created only in 72 hours, so it contains a ton of bugs!). In this game the player controls an ethereal spirit, protecting the Elder Tree from evil creatures.Inspired by the latest news about researching space and plans of colonization of Mars in the near future, we picked up sci-fi terraforming as a theme for the new game. We truly believe mankind may land and establish an extra-terrestrial colony soon and want to highlight this topic to people in any way we can. We had a lot of internal conversations trying to predict how terraforming might look. What should be done and which technologies would be used to achieve that? In our opinion, the terraforming should happen in a few waves -
exploration & reconnaissance,
probing,
initial part of terraforming process (which involves manned and unmanned robots operating in hostile environment)
a final phase, when humans can land on the ground and complete the process on the surface.
The word ""Ecopoiesis"" itself ( from the Greek οἶκος [oikos] - ""house"", and ποίησις [poiesis] - ""production"") was suggested by famous biophysicist Robert Haynes. He described this word as ""a fabrication of a sustainable ecosystem on a currently lifeless, sterile planet"" by making some primary engineering and biological processes in order to complete the initial part of terraforming. Our game focuses on this, 'Ecopoiesis' part. You can read more about the game below.

Campaign goalsWe want to be completely transparent by explaining the campaign goals. This is all about money (as are all the other projects on IndieGoGo). Each month we need to pay a rent for our office, pay for internet, obtain required software, pay subscriptions for different SaaS products (such as Jira/Confluence, etc). None of us have other income and our initial funding is dwindling. This creates issues as we cannot complete development, invest in hardware or software or meet other financial commitments.Helping us get to as little as US $10,000 (and more is better!) will enable us to survive, thrive and make a successful release of our first commercial game on Steam. 
ReasonsAs this game is the first commercial project by our combined team, we are faced with simple and quite obvious issues (now they are obvious). The main reason we have used up most of our initial funding was the developing process itself, which took more time as expected. This caused by a several reasons all of which we have learnt from:
Underestimating the time to complete complex modelling and programming tasks.
Driven by our desire to make the process more educable by streaming everything and setting it all up took away from the time we could devote to development which was further impacted by explaining the game creation.
Lengthy exploration and discussion on how to make things more ‘realistic’ from a science point of view but still gamified.
As we are not astrophysicists or even space engineers with a background to prove all our ideas, we are always open for further discussions of how to improve storytelling or in-game terraforming processes.

RisksAt this moment we have a playable beta version of the game with one planet and 5 finished levels and full gameplay. Later we will put it on Steam and send keys for closed beta to our backers (US $15+). Ecopoiesis will be released with one planet and 20 levels in mid-January. If we receive support from you we may implement more planets (with different gameplays) and more in-game mechanics. It also means we get to keep our development space and keep the team members together. Work to doAs mentioned above, our main goal is to release the game on Steam with appropriate quality as soon as possible. In addition, and if you can help support us, we plan to:
Add controllers support
Add new mission types

Add better sound effects
Add more comics (for storytelling)
Get professional voicepacks for game and OST
Add new mission types
Add more planets and new missions (as DLCs)
Port game on mobiles, tablets*
Port game on XBox, PS4 and Nintendo Switch*
*Two last points depends on funds we may raise during this campaign and sales on Steam.How you can help usThere are several ways of helping us:
Become a backer. Not only will we be very grateful, you will also receive bonuses, like special in-game skins, early (+ beta) and full accesses to the game, free DLCs and OST and more other things.
Tell your friends about this game and post a message in social networks about us. You can not imagine how good this type of help is!
Help us to improve 'sci-fi' (or just the 'sci') part of the game. If you have knowledge in astrophysics or biophysics - we always are open to suggestions on how to make this game more realistic :)

 GameplayEcopoiesis is a top-down sci-fi action where the player controls a drone which protects the reactor from aliens. The game goal is to terraform a planet by completing 20 missions on it. In most of the levels the player needs to protect the reactor and 'farms' (a separate landing module which also generates oxygen) from aliens. There are different types of aliens, some of them attack reactors and 'farms', others target the drone and special drop pods with upgrades. Game entitiesP-03 ""Pytheas"" drone is an unmanned robot, remotely controlled by an operator from an orbital station. This model was developed for exploration and maintenance tasks, however after encountering the first contact with aliens, engineers re-programmed its core to emit EMP waves which can destroy ferromagnetic forms of life (aliens). Reactor is a landing module which generates energy required for creating and supporting an energy dome. It acts like a greenhouse, keeping oxygen and heat inside, running some chemical reactions to separate oxygen from the local atmosphere. After acquiring the required oxygen level, it turns into a passive mode, which only supports the dome (providing no further interest for aliens). Once this phase is over, people can land on the surface under the dome and proceed to terraforming phase 3 (establishing a colony). TW-02 'Tekton' drones are unmanned worker robots whose task is to place landing beacons for farms that are going to land from a low orbit and maintain the reactor. Due to their low energy consumption and extreme durability, these bots have no value to aliens. Farm is a module that lands on a placed landing beacon from the space. Farms are used to seed and plant a special kind of vegetation, genetically modified for running photosynthesis many times faster and more effectively than on Earth. After landing, farms begin to spread seeds and to light plants with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Drop pods with tools are also low orbital modules with all the necessary elements and tools required for on-site upgrades and improvements of structures and other robots. Due to their medium energy generation and consumption, they can be targeted by some alien forms of life. Aliens. Orbital and surface probes detected several magnetic anomalies  below the ground. We don't have enough information about these anomalies yet, except that they seem to be a non-intelligent, ferromagnetic species. Some probes were attacked by Ferrites (that's what our scientist call them), probably because of their energy reactors. We need to examine and find a way in which we can defend ourselves from these species.More others game objects are coming soon, check our updates!

<h3><strong>About Us &amp; Our Project</strong></h3>
<p>We want communities to be able to easily interact with the planning system and put forward their opinions on what their city should become.</p>
<p>In January 2016 we won Innovate UK's Innovation in Urban Spaces contest, this allowed us to look into new ways of using mapping data to engage residents in the planning process. We use Minecraft as it is an easy to use 3D design tool that doesn't leave out some of the most important people within a community, young people. </p>
<p>For the past year we have been designing a new platform that can take any data and create an accurate model of a city in Minecraft.</p>
<p>We have now started our first map using this platform, and it is of Brighton and Hove in East Sussex. We need your help to finish it. </p>
<p>Once digital Brighton is complete we will make the map freely available for young people to play at home.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are initially asking for £7,000 as that will fund us to bring the higher resolution data into Minecraft. This is our most basic ask and it enable us to release a digitally generated model of Brighton and Hove from geospatial data. We also have stretch goals should we reach beyond that.</p>
<p>If we hit £7,000 we will<br/>- Purchase the data needed to complete the poor resolution areas of the map. <br/>- Complete the model, this means it will include all the newly purchased data so we have a fully accurate map. <br/>- Run workshops across July and August with participants collaboratively texturing areas of the map to make it look photorealistic. </p>
<p>If we hit £10,000 we will <br/>- Do all of the above.<br/>- Model 3 extra areas in photorealistic detail.</p>
<p>If we hit £20,000 we will<br/>- Do all of the above.<br/>- Model all key areas of Brighton and Hove in photorealistic detail (these areas can be found in the perks section).</p>
<p>If we hit £50,000 <br/>- Do all of the above.<br/>- Model all of BN1 in photorealistic detail.</p>
<p>If we hit £100,000<br/>- Do all of the above.<br/>- We will Model all of the Brighton and Hove map (BN1, BN2 and BN3).</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want to create an accurate Minecraft map of England, and we are starting with our home town of Brighton. With the funding from this campaign we will be able to launch this map in beautiful detail for anybody to use and interact with. Once the campaign is over we will be making the map available to play at home. This means that local children will be able to interact with their city in a brand new way! </p>
<p>Since we set up in August 2014 we have been using digital technology as a way to engage the public in planning and the environment. We feel that Minecraft offers a unique opportunity to view an area in a new light, and to explore a new topic you may not have been interested in before. For us it is a valuable way of speaking to people who would not normally be consulted, and getting their opinions and feedback. We have worked with thousands of children and adults since we started, and we pride ourselves on creating a fun environment for people to discuss topics that can be contentious, and enabling them to collaboratively design solutions to issues. </p>
<p>We are planning to do the same with this map, but on a larger scale. We will be able to run workshops in any area of Brighton using an accurate map for residents to engage with. We appreciate any support you can give us in creating the ultimate blocky version of Brighton!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One big risk is that we do not get enough funding to be able to complete the map in its basic form. If we do not reach our £7,000 funding goal we will use the money we do raise as match funding to try and find other potential sources, such as grants. We will still run the workshops and send out the perks that have been purchased.</p>
<p>Another risk is fulfilling the rewards. To tackle this we have allowed plenty of time for all the items that need to be printed and shipped. In terms of workshops we are used to running these and don't see them as an issue.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We would love any help with this campaign, and we would really appreciate it if you could share this page with as many people as possible. We want to spread the word and get everybody using our Brighton map! </p>
<p>We are also looking for any data that you may have, such as Sketch Up models of buildings, any GIS data or BIM models. Or if there is another way you would like to help please just get in contact. We are not limited to Brighton either, as if we are successful we do want to continue mapping areas all across the country.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to explore our campaign!</p>

We have worked with thousands of children and adults since we started, and we pride ourselves on creating a fun environment for people to discuss topics that can be contentious, and enabling them to collaboratively design solutions to issues. 
We are planning to do the same with this map, but on a larger scale. We will be able to run workshops in any area of Brighton using an accurate map for residents to engage with. We appreciate any support you can give us in creating the ultimate blocky version of Brighton!

Risks & Challenges
One big risk is that we do not get enough funding to be able to complete the map in its basic form. If we do not reach our £7,000 funding goal we will use the money we do raise as match funding to try and find other potential sources, such as grants. We will still run the workshops and send out the perks that have been purchased.
Another risk is fulfilling the rewards. To tackle this we have allowed plenty of time for all the items that need to be printed and shipped. In terms of workshops we are used to running these and don't see them as an issue.

Other Ways You Can Help
We would love any help with this campaign, and we would really appreciate it if you could share this page with as many people as possible. We want to spread the word and get everybody using our Brighton map! 
We are also looking for any data that you may have, such as Sketch Up models of buildings, any GIS data or BIM models. Or if there is another way you would like to help please just get in contact. We are not limited to Brighton either, as if we are successful we do want to continue mapping areas all across the country.
Thank you so much for taking the time to explore our campaign!

<p>Two years ago I started a research project in order to find out if mobile games can be redefined such that they <strong>increase</strong> the amount and quality of face-to-face communication among children. After a lot of hard work my project team developed the 'Seaburbs' technology and built a cooking game based on this technology. After conducting scientific tests we were thrilled to discover that face-to-face communication among children playing the Seaburbs game increased six-fold, from 13% all the way up to 80%! </p>

<h3>The Game</h3>
</div><div><p>Okay so, you join your friends on a deserted island, in the middle of nowhere. You can't escape. It's survival of The Fittest. To make matters worse, one of your ""friends"" is trying to murder everyone on the island in cold blood. Whoever manages to find a weapon first begins to go insane and becomes the Fittest. As a Survivor, you must either vote the Fittest off the island, build a boat to escape the island, or become the Fittest and kill everybody. As the killer (aka the Fittest) you need to either kill everybody, or stay the Fittest by the time the match ends. The game will feature various roles, for example you can play as a Lumberjack to harvest wood (Wood is useful for various things, such as building a campfire in order to hold meetings), or if you want to communicate with dead players (Ghosts!!) you can play as a Medium.</p></div><div>
<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I began my game development journey in 2018, learned the basics and proceeded to fully develop and publish two mobile games on both the App Store and Play Store. Now, as an individual with much more experience than I had two years ago, I'd like to take my journey a step further. The plan is simple: Conceive and create a fun, memorable PC game that has the potential to provide players with outstanding experiences.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Obstacle</h3>
<p>I have the skill required to finish this game. I have all the time in the world. The only thing I'm missing is money. I'm age 18 and still living with my parents. No job yet. Don't get me wrong, I'm incredibly fortunate to have a roof over my head, a shirt on my back and warm meals.

</div></div>","Cost Breakdown

(Photon Networking was ripped from the project due to lack of funds, I will use free P2P networking instead)
Google Ads + Facebook/Instagram Ads: $50 per campaign ($25 + $25)
Website domain + hosting: $8 monthly w/ Amazon Lightsail + $15 annually for domain

 
The Game
Okay so, you join your friends on a deserted island, in the middle of nowhere. You can't escape. It's survival of The Fittest. To make matters worse, one of your ""friends"" is trying to murder everyone on the island in cold blood. Whoever manages to find a weapon first begins to go insane and becomes the Fittest. As a Survivor, you must either vote the Fittest off the island, build a boat to escape the island, or become the Fittest and kill everybody. As the killer (aka the Fittest) you need to either kill everybody, or stay the Fittest by the time the match ends. The game will feature various roles, for example you can play as a Lumberjack to harvest wood (Wood is useful for various things, such as building a campfire in order to hold meetings), or if you want to communicate with dead players (Ghosts!!) you can play as a Medium.
My Story
I began my game development journey in 2018, learned the basics and proceeded to fully develop and publish two mobile games on both the App Store and Play Store. Now, as an individual with much more experience than I had two years ago, I'd like to take my journey a step further. The plan is simple: Conceive and create a fun, memorable PC game that has the potential to provide players with outstanding experiences.

The Obstacle
I have the skill required to finish this game. I have all the time in the world. The only thing I'm missing is money. I'm age 18 and still living with my parents. No job yet. Don't get me wrong, I'm incredibly fortunate to have a roof over my head, a shirt on my back and warm meals. However, without money, I won't be able to pay for some things essential to developing my game, such as servers for players to play on and paid software to assist in the development of the project.
TL;DR
I'm making an online party game, and need funding in order to fulfill my vision for said game. Thanks for reading.

<h2><strong>Would love for mankind persist without mankind itself?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The story takes place at <strong>The Edge of Time</strong>, the frontier of existence, where there are no civilizations left. The ocean of space is fractured, yet sometimes memories of different living beings gone long ago materialize themselves. One of such formations is <strong>The Land of Man</strong>.</p>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/2vkUwh02GQfmerEKDJ/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You play as an <strong>Edge Walker</strong>  - a divine being, drawn to appearance of material objects with a want to know what makes these remnants stand the test of time and still leave their mark in the universe aeons later.</p>
<p>You will walk across different locations representing different human cultures and mythologies that cherished the search for truth in different, yet somehow shared ways. You will observe how different religions and people of various cultures sought the answers to their questions on existence, and find your own answers to some of them - not as a character, but as a player. </p>
<p><strong>The game is planned for release on Steam with English and Russian languages later in 2019. Approximate average length of the game - 3 hours.</strong></p>

<p>The game features <strong>minimalistic</strong> gameplay focused on <strong>exploration and visual storytelling</strong>, following the tropes of genre-defining <i>Dear Esther</i>. Your aim as an Edge Walker is to travel through different locations, observing both <strong>the fall and the ascension</strong> of people of different beliefs. You will go through places marked with strong emotional footprint: places of war, joy, grief and worship that still resonate through the universe.</p>

While it enriches the experience, the game's narrative can be followed without reading it, if it's the way you are searching for your answers.</p>
<p><strong>Voice narration</strong> -  your journey is narrated by voice that provides additional insight to the stories as well as reacts to your surroundings if you happen to stumble upon peculiar places. </p>

<p><strong>Nikita Kalashnikov </strong>- junior game designer focused on narrative design. Worked on video games, tabletop games and live role-playing games. Recieved medical education and after working as a surgeon for couple of years, he decided to leave and turn the unending passion for games into profession. His other affection are books, so he tries to combine these two types of entertainment. Slowly walking on spiritual path and combining many religions and philosophies, his goal in this project is to share the experience and, hopefully, provide a platform for conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Valery Vagin - </strong>military man and a firefighter in the past, now he's just a man that explores edges of the world. Not so long ago he met a friend, who offered to try his hand in this project. He's ready to hear any critique of his craft, and thinks that this project is a great opportunity to know his strengths and to come forward with his craft.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't have set musician at the moment, so I can't provide you with the information about the music. We do have people interested in working for the project, and as soon as we have a dedicated soundperson who will work on music and sound design I will update the page with the respective information. I would love to include soundtrack in the package available, but as for now, I can't talk about specifics.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557153358/zx92d9itewhz2x4gstzu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The most important thing that this platform helps me to achieve is communication with potential audience. The game's idea can be a very niche one and I would love to have an ability to listen to the feedback and optimize the experience for people interested in this type of game. This won't jeopardize the creative vision, but will definetly benefit the project.</p>
<p>Also, even with the small scope of the game, it still needs the funds to achieve it. It is my project of passion and I am fortunate to work with people who help me pro bono for now, but there's no doubt that they need to be commended for their great work. I invest heavily in this project with my own scarce savings to pay for artists' work, assets and other production costs, and while <strong>the game will be made</strong> <strong>no matter what</strong>, it would be a dream come true to gather enough resources to ensure the best quality of the project.</p>
<p>Being transparent about the work is important for the team and the audience, so this is how requested funds are going to be distributed:</p>
<p><b>1500$ </b>serve as <strong>payment for the work of developer, artist and musician</strong> for the next 3 to 4 months of development planned, each getting a third of the sum. This is the basic funding we can ask for, the main priority is to raise the quality of the game an not to make this platform a source of salary for the duration.</p>
<p><strong>500$ </strong>are dedicated to get the help of a <strong>3d-modeler</strong> to work on specific assets for the game. This would give an opportunity to direct the exact vision of the team.</p>
<p><strong>500$ </strong>are dedicated to the <strong>Asset Fund</strong>. This would provide a funding to purchase appropriate assets, plugins, visual effects and software needed for the development.</p>
<p><strong>500$ </strong>are dedicated to <strong>studio voice-recording and small-scale promotion</strong>. This will help to raise the bar of the game's quality as well as raise some awareness for the project during fundraising and before imminent release.</p>
<p><strong>500$ </strong>are dedicated to <strong>Indiegogo supporters</strong>. This includes production of physical merchandise.</p>
<p>I believe this amount covers the basics of the development while being objective about the scope of the game. If the desired amount is not met, then the funds will be split between the people working on the game to cover their work, as well as the purchase of the required assets. </p>
</div><div>
<p>The development definetly won't be a smooth ride, but I'm focused on delivering the project as promised, so every obstacle need to be dealt with. Most of the difficulties will probably come from the technical side of the project: coding or performance issues.  If such challenge arrives I will spend time to resolve it myself, but if this will prove to be beyond my capabilities I will find the according specialist to resolve the issue. This can require additional expenses, but a part of the required funds is dedicated to such scenarios. Otherwise, these funds will go towards creative part of the game.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What you mean by the game being short?</strong></p>
<p><b>A: </b>The game is made to be played in 1 or 2 sittings, so exploring all locations and reading the short stories will result 4 to 5 hour experience.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What language will the game have?</strong></p>
<p><b>A: </b>The game will be released with English and Russian text and voice-over. There are no plans for another languages at the moment, but if the opportunity arises, and we will have funds to do it, we will consider the localization.</p>

Material objects as well as spiritual flows and their manifestaions will guide you through the journey of mankind, while short stories will provide you with additional perspectives, forming your own view on mankind and the world around them. By seeing, hearing and touching the souls striving for something higher you will find your own place amongst them and understand what it meant to be a human.
 In-game book of short stories - the game features fully animated book with hand-drawn art.

The art in the game is being drawn on paper by hand and transffered on the pages of the book to better fit the style. Here you can see some of the art, done by our passionate artist:

It is my project of passion and I am fortunate to work with people who help me pro bono for now, but there's no doubt that they need to be commended for their great work. I invest heavily in this project with my own scarce savings to pay for artists' work, assets and other production costs, and while the game will be made no matter what, it would be a dream come true to gather enough resources to ensure the best quality of the project.
Being transparent about the work is important for the team and the audience, so this is how requested funds are going to be distributed:
1500$ serve as payment for the work of developer, artist and musician for the next 3 to 4 months of development planned, each getting a third of the sum. This is the basic funding we can ask for, the main priority is to raise the quality of the game an not to make this platform a source of salary for the duration.
500$ are dedicated to get the help of a 3d-modeler to work on specific assets for the game. This would give an opportunity to direct the exact vision of the team.
500$ are dedicated to the Asset Fund. This would provide a funding to purchase appropriate assets, plugins, visual effects and software needed for the development.
500$ are dedicated to studio voice-recording and small-scale promotion. This will help to raise the bar of the game's quality as well as raise some awareness for the project during fundraising and before imminent release.
500$ are dedicated to Indiegogo supporters. This includes production of physical merchandise.
I believe this amount covers the basics of the development while being objective about the scope of the game. If the desired amount is not met, then the funds will be split between the people working on the game to cover their work, as well as the purchase of the required assets. 

The development definetly won't be a smooth ride, but I'm focused on delivering the project as promised, so every obstacle need to be dealt with.

Q: What are targeted platforms for the release?
A: For now we are aimed to release the game on Steam as we are sure in being able to provide everything as promised. We would be happy to release on other platforms and devices, but that's something that we will work on post-release.
Q: What you mean by the game being short?
A: The game is made to be played in 1 or 2 sittings, so exploring all locations and reading the short stories will result 4 to 5 hour experience.
Q: What language will the game have?
A: The game will be released with English and Russian text and voice-over. There are no plans for another languages at the moment, but if the opportunity arises, and we will have funds to do it, we will consider the localization.
If you're find yourself not interested in the game, please consider to share the campaign with someone you know who might be interested.

<h3>About this project</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p><b>Escape room Karosta</b> is a real-life adventure game where you are locked in a room full of secret puzzles. Puzzle solving can lead you to the goal - escaping from the room, but time is running out - you have <b>60 minutes</b>.</p>
<p>The game can be played by <b>2 - 5 people</b>. It can be an exciting adventure for you and your friends as well as an empowering team building activity for business companies.</p>
<h4>Game plot</h4>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div><p>It's hard to tell where exactly you are and how you got there. It could be late 40's as well as mid 80's. There are some kind of screens on the walls. There are some evidences that you can see trough them and can be seen too. Every of your movement and thought gets logged. Somebody has full control of what you do and think. Kind of totalitarian regime? </p><p>But there is one clue left, one message, that someone has left to you. He or she was here before and figured out how to escape from this madness. If you want to think about escaping, first you need to figure out how to keep thinking without being noticed.</p>
<h3><b>What is different about this room?</b></h3>
<p>There are plenty of rooms that look fancy and authentic, but somehow you just can't get the feeling that you are really locked in unbreakable room which is in the middle of nowhere or deep down under.</p>
<p>Our story is different.</p>
<h4><b>Location: Karosta, Liepaja, Latvia</b></h4>
<p>Our escape room is located in the world famous <b>Karosta Prison</b>. What's so special about this place? In 20th century it was a military prison for <b>Tsar's Navy, Nazist Security Service</b> and <b>KGB</b> as well. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1186123/files/20150131080923-key.jpg.jpg?1422720563"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>In 21st century however Karosta prison (today a non-profit organization) has become a major tourism attraction offering guided tours, museum expositions, and a reality show that gives you full prison experience. You won't find a better place to build an escape room, than those gloomy cells.</p><p><br/></p>
<h4><b>Arduino - <strike>Brain</strike> Heart of Our Escape Room</b></h4>
<p>We are setting up <a href=""http://arduino.cc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arduino</a> micro-controller as our game server. Escape room will be fully automated and the game will be able to run without administrating. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1186229/files/20150131085747-qwerty.jpg.jpg?1422723467"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">However, the game will be supervised by administrator trough surveillance cameras and by two-way audio communication if needed.</span></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><b><br/></b></h3><h3 style=""text-align: left;""><b>Our Team</b></h3><p>We are bunch of guys and girls well orientated and working in tourism, software and electronic engineering, marketing and art. We are a company that searches for adventures and fun activities.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1185400/files/20150130165811-Kopa-2.jpg?1422665891"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>From the left: Edgars, Monta, Daiva and Kristers.</i></p><div>
<p>While exploring other existing recreational activities around us, we came to conclusion that many of them were similar to each other or not located nearby. By putting our heads together, we analyzed our escape room experience and decided to make a better one based on our knowledge.</p>
<div>
<p>Also we are creating this project in partnership with the <b>Karosta Rescue Society</b>, which is a non-profit organization and part of our income from the Escape Room will be given to save and restore the historical heritage of Karosta Naval Port.</p>
<br/>
<h3><b>Why We Need Your Help?</b></h3>
<p>We need your help to raise <b>$5000 </b>to create worlds first escape room located in a real prison. In return for your support, you will be the <b>first to discover the room</b> and have a chance to <b>spend a night in Prison</b> like a real prisoner.</p>
<p>All funds will be used for building materials, interior, furniture and electronic parts. None of the funds will be used for marketing activities or personal usage like coffee or late night treats.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p><b>Interiour &amp; Furniture</b></p>
<p>This draws up the biggest part of the budget - this is what goes into the rooms - all the furniture, home accessories, anything you can find indoors.</p>
<p><b>Electronic components</b></p>
<p>We are building our escape room with lots of electronics like sensors, buttons, displays for player interaction as their visible part and relay boards and micro-controllers as hidden part. This section also includes lights, wiring and other electronic gadgets.</p>
<p><b>Building materials</b></p>
<p>Here we count in anything that refers to room redecoration, secret chamber and passageway creation, materials for building walls. Karosta Prison has very thick walls, thats why we must create some secret chambers and make them well hidden for you :)</p>
<p><b>Game administration equipment</b></p>
<p>There are things needed for game administration it self, like video surveillance cameras, two-way audio communication system, monitors, ticket scanner and other things.</p>
<p><b>Other expenses</b></p>
<p>Under this section we count in any other unforseen expenses that may appear during the project. Also some transaction fees are included.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<h3><b>What will you get?</b></h3>
<p>Our <b>#1</b> <b>Perk</b> is a <b>Thank You Message &amp; Drum Solo video</b>. We will record a video specially for you, with a Thank You message and 30 second, one of a kind drum solo from our team member - Edgars! Can you resist that? :)</p>

<h4><b>Karosta</b></h4>
<h3></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Karosta is a unique naval port located in Liepaja, Latvia. Karosta was built at the end of 19th century by Russian Tsar to host The Baltic Naval Forces of Russian Empire. A huge military town was erected claiming more than 20 km2 at the Baltic sea to host some <b>120 warships</b> and <b>20 000 soldiers</b>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1188965/files/20150201183143-xcv.jpeg?1422844303"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Karosta bridge</i></p>
<p>Later in 20th century Karosta was used by Latvian army as well as German and Soviet armies. During the Cold War Karosta became a military base of highest importance since it lay on the western border of Soviet Union and had nearly <b>40 000 Soviet troops</b> and a submarine base. For 100 years Karosta has been a city within a city, unknown to the inhabitants of Liepaja. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>What is Karosta today? A unique place that you have to see with your own eyes. Karosta has only 5000 peolpe living there now and although most of the military structures are in ruins, there are some stuning sights. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><b>Karosta Prison</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p>The top place to visit in Karosta is definately Karosta Prison. From 1905 till 1997 it was used as a detention centre for misbehaving soldiers of Tsar's Navy, German Imperial Forces in WWI, Latvian Army, German Kriegsmarine and SD (Security Service) during WWII and of course Soviet Army and Navy. Those walls have seen more than you would like to imagine. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Karosta Prison</i></p>

About this project

Escape room Karosta is a real-life adventure game where you are locked in a room full of secret puzzles. Puzzle solving can lead you to the goal - escaping from the room, but time is running out - you have 60 minutes.
The game can be played by 2 - 5 people. It can be an exciting adventure for you and your friends as well as an empowering team building activity for business companies.
Game plot


It's hard to tell where exactly you are and how you got there. It could be late 40's as well as mid 80's. There are some kind of screens on the walls. There are some evidences that you can see trough them and can be seen too. Every of your movement and thought gets logged. Somebody has full control of what you do and think. Kind of totalitarian regime? But there is one clue left, one message, that someone has left to you. He or she was here before and figured out how to escape from this madness. If you want to think about escaping, first you need to figure out how to keep thinking without being noticed.
What is different about this room?
There are plenty of rooms that look fancy and authentic, but somehow you just can't get the feeling that you are really locked in unbreakable room which is in the middle of nowhere or deep down under.
Our story is different.
Location: Karosta, Liepaja, Latvia
Our escape room is located in the world famous Karosta Prison. What's so special about this place? In 20th century it was a military prison for Tsar's Navy, Nazist Security Service and KGB as well. In 21st century however Karosta prison (today a non-profit organization) has become a major tourism attraction offering guided tours, museum expositions, and a reality show that gives you full prison experience. You won't find a better place to build an escape room, than those gloomy cells.
Arduino - Brain Heart of Our Escape Room
We are setting up Arduino micro-controller as our game server. Escape room will be fully automated and the game will be able to run without administrating. However, the game will be supervised by administrator trough surveillance cameras and by two-way audio communication if needed.
Our TeamWe are bunch of guys and girls well orientated and working in tourism, software and electronic engineering, marketing and art. We are a company that searches for adventures and fun activities.
From the left: Edgars, Monta, Daiva and Kristers.
While exploring other existing recreational activities around us, we came to conclusion that many of them were similar to each other or not located nearby. By putting our heads together, we analyzed our escape room experience and decided to make a better one based on our knowledge.

Also we are creating this project in partnership with the Karosta Rescue Society, which is a non-profit organization and part of our income from the Escape Room will be given to save and restore the historical heritage of Karosta Naval Port.

Why We Need Your Help?
We need your help to raise $5000 to create worlds first escape room located in a real prison. In return for your support, you will be the first to discover the room and have a chance to spend a night in Prison like a real prisoner.
All funds will be used for building materials, interior, furniture and electronic parts. None of the funds will be used for marketing activities or personal usage like coffee or late night treats.









Interiour & Furniture
This draws up the biggest part of the budget - this is what goes into the rooms - all the furniture, home accessories, anything you can find indoors.
Electronic components
We are building our escape room with lots of electronics like sensors, buttons, displays for player interaction as their visible part and relay boards and micro-controllers as hidden part. This section also includes lights, wiring and other electronic gadgets.
Building materials
Here we count in anything that refers to room redecoration, secret chamber and passageway creation, materials for building walls. Karosta Prison has very thick walls, thats why we must create some secret chambers and make them well hidden for you :)
Game administration equipment
There are things needed for game administration it self, like video surveillance cameras, two-way audio communication system, monitors, ticket scanner and other things.
Other expenses
Under this section we count in any other unforseen expenses that may appear during the project. Also some transaction fees are included.


What will you get?
Our #1 Perk is a Thank You Message & Drum Solo video. We will record a video specially for you, with a Thank You message and 30 second, one of a kind drum solo from our team member - Edgars! Can you resist that? :)

More about Karosta and Karosta Prison
Karosta


Karosta is a unique naval port located in Liepaja, Latvia. Karosta was built at the end of 19th century by Russian Tsar to host The Baltic Naval Forces of Russian Empire. A huge military town was erected claiming more than 20 km2 at the Baltic sea to host some 120 warships and 20 000 soldiers. 


Karosta bridge
Later in 20th century Karosta was used by Latvian army as well as German and Soviet armies. During the Cold War Karosta became a military base of highest importance since it lay on the western border of Soviet Union and had nearly 40 000 Soviet troops and a submarine base. For 100 years Karosta has been a city within a city, unknown to the inhabitants of Liepaja. 

What is Karosta today? A unique place that you have to see with your own eyes. Karosta has only 5000 peolpe living there now and although most of the military structures are in ruins, there are some stuning sights. 

Karosta Prison

The top place to visit in Karosta is definately Karosta Prison. From 1905 till 1997 it was used as a detention centre for misbehaving soldiers of Tsar's Navy, German Imperial Forces in WWI, Latvian Army, German Kriegsmarine and SD (Security Service) during WWII and of course Soviet Army and Navy. Those walls have seen more than you would like to imagine. 






Karosta Prison
Since 2002 Karosta Prison is fully open to tourism attracting some 20 000 visitors annually. Karosta Prison is run by a non-profit organization Karosta Rescue Society and offer its guests guided tours and museum expositions as well as some shocking experiences like the reality show ""Behind the bars"" or the extreme night. 
Karosta Prison has been voted the most extraordinary hotel in the world and for a reason! More info you can get at www.karostascietums.lv
Risks & Challenges
If we don't reach our goal we will recalculate our budget, set priorities to continue with and look for other financial support, but one thing is for sure - there will be Escape Room Karosta.
In case of this scenario, work process may slow down a bit, so a delayed opening date also is possible.  

Other ways you can help
Financial aid is not the only way to help us. We would also appreciate if you could spread the word on social media - Facebook and Twitter by sharing this campaign. Or maybe you own some old lamp, rotary telephone or something similar that could perfectly fit into our Escape room.

FAQ
When Escape Room Karosta will be open?
If everything goes well, May 1st is our opening date!
How long does my ticket remain valid?
Tickets will be valid until you use them so don’t worry. But we’d love to meet our funders sooner :)
How much will the ticket prices go up after Indiegogo?
Double ticket will rise up from $25 to $30 and group ticket - from $50 to $55.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Alejandro and I've come to Indiegogo to present you my project. First, allow me to introduce myself. I'm an 18 year-old guy from Spain, living in Barcelona, and I'm an avid fan of gaming and the airsoft sport ever since I can remember. Unfortunately, here in Spain there are not many places where you can practice this sport, so I thought: ""Why don't I make my own Airsoft Field so people can come and have fun playing this awesome sport?"". And here I am, presenting you my project. But think further about it, what if you could play airsoft in a video-game themed field? Wouldn't it be awesome to play airsoft in a field that totally looks like Dust II from Counter Strike?</p>
<p>This is my project. A video-game themed airsoft field.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>How can I help? What will I get?</h3> <p><br/></p>
<p>I am aware that this is a big project and that I'll be needing a lot of money to be able to take it forward. I have part of the money but I highly doubt I could afford to begin the project in a full scale with it, that's why I'm asking you for help.</p>
<p>I've set the goal to 5.000€, which I think would be enough to rent an industrial space to set the field, and buy the necessary materials to set up everything (Airsoft weapons, security clothing, helmets, goggles, materials to build up the walls...), in other words, those 5.000€ are going to be directed straight to the project, it will help me set up everything and you will be getting updates on everything I do about it.</p>
<p>My main goal right now is to get enough money to get everything set up and start getting my hands dirty creating the shooting field, which will be the Dust II map from the famous series Counter Strike. As I said before, I will be posting updates on everything I get done. That stands for pictures, receipts... So you can see that I'm using the money I get from here to fund the project. If you want to see the rewards you can get by donating, please refer to the proper section.</p>
<p>If the money doesn't reach the specified quantity, you can be sure I'll be using whatever I get from here toturn the project into a reality by working as hard as I can to get the rest.</p>

</div><div> <p><br/></p>
<p>As I said before, there are not many places in Spain to play airsoft, and the few that exist are either too crowded or with barely enough people to start a game. My objective is to create a totally new airsoft field with a map that can be familiar to a lot of people, I want an airsoft field that people actually feel nervous to play at. If I get some people to play in my airsoft field, walk around it and get them to think: ""Wow, this totally feels like a Counter Strike game, it's like I'm walking in the game"" then you can be sure I'll feel completely satisfied, because that's the feeling I want people to get.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For all of you who don't know what I'm talking about, here are some screenshots from the Dust II map, in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.</p>

<div>I'm not going to lie, for me, this is a very risky project. It can either go terribly right, or terribly wrong, I'm putting the money I have into this project, I want it to be my project of future and make a living out of it. So you could say this is an all or nothing situation, that is why I require your help. I can assure you I will be eternally grateful if you donate to my project. Of course, this situation only makes me stronger to overcome whatever obstacle can come in my way.</div>

<div>Spread the word! If for whatever reason you can't colaborate with a donation (please, remember that every euro helps, even if it's just one!) just spread the word to your family and friends, show them the project and let them decide if they want to colaborate and donate to this project I'm creating, remember to share the project on Twitter, Facebook or any other social media, every way to help, as little as it seems, can make a huge difference!</div>

I've set the goal to 5.000€, which I think would be enough to rent an industrial space to set the field, and buy the necessary materials to set up everything (Airsoft weapons, security clothing, helmets, goggles, materials to build up the walls...), in other words, those 5.000€ are going to be directed straight to the project, it will help me set up everything and you will be getting updates on everything I do about it.
My main goal right now is to get enough money to get everything set up and start getting my hands dirty creating the shooting field, which will be the Dust II map from the famous series Counter Strike. As I said before, I will be posting updates on everything I get done. That stands for pictures, receipts... So you can see that I'm using the money I get from here to fund the project. If you want to see the rewards you can get by donating, please refer to the proper section.
If the money doesn't reach the specified quantity, you can be sure I'll be using whatever I get from here toturn the project into a reality by working as hard as I can to get the rest.

Why all this?
 
As I said before, there are not many places in Spain to play airsoft, and the few that exist are either too crowded or with barely enough people to start a game. My objective is to create a totally new airsoft field with a map that can be familiar to a lot of people, I want an airsoft field that people actually feel nervous to play at. If I get some people to play in my airsoft field, walk around it and get them to think: ""Wow, this totally feels like a Counter Strike game, it's like I'm walking in the game"" then you can be sure I'll feel completely satisfied, because that's the feeling I want people to get.

For all of you who don't know what I'm talking about, here are some screenshots from the Dust II map, in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.




   Risks? Challenges?

I'm not going to lie, for me, this is a very risky project. It can either go terribly right, or terribly wrong, I'm putting the money I have into this project, I want it to be my project of future and make a living out of it. So you could say this is an all or nothing situation, that is why I require your help. I can assure you I will be eternally grateful if you donate to my project. Of course, this situation only makes me stronger to overcome whatever obstacle can come in my way.

    Is there any other way I can colaborate?

Spread the word! If for whatever reason you can't colaborate with a donation (please, remember that every euro helps, even if it's just one!) just spread the word to your family and friends, show them the project and let them decide if they want to colaborate and donate to this project I'm creating, remember to share the project on Twitter, Facebook or any other social media, every way to help, as little as it seems, can make a huge difference!
 Thanks a lot for reading through the project. If you're interested in donating, please head to the proper section and read the different rewards!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Star Zeal is a 4x space strategy game with a more personal interaction with your civilization and its characters. It can be considered as a hybrid between an RPG and a 4x space civilization builder. You will be able to play as many different species, even minor ones, from large militaristic empires to isolated nomadic species, or even a race of pirates. The end goals of each faction created, or pre-made can be extremely variable. Sometimes a faction simply wants to hide from everyone in their tiny corner of the universe.</p>
<p>The main game has you play in the Milky Way galaxy with pre-made star clusters and systems like our own the Sol system and many procedural star clusters. You will be able to choose from a multitude of species within their own family to form a faction  such as humanoid, reptilian, insectoid, mechanical, other mammalian species and even non corporeal beings. </p>
<p>One of the main features is the extremely large playable area, an entire galaxy! With thousands of procedurally generated and hand made star systems. You will probably never explore it all. The player can start off as any available species or go with what is more familiar like the young Human Empire recovering from long tribal wars on Earth.</p>

</p><p><b>Why is Social Sniper special? <br/></b><span>Social Sniper is an attempt to create an entirely new type of online/offline
gaming experience. We call it cross-world gaming. We want to take multiplayer
action games from the computer screen, and into the real world, to get players
outside and active, to be immersive in their community, and in their interaction
with real people. </span></p>
<p>We’re not the first to try
this, but by focusing on a simple, casual gaming style, and compelling
gameplay, we want to be the ones who take cross-world gaming into the
mainstream. The basic story of Social Sniper casts you as a secret assassin, with
one or more other players as a target. Your goal is to find the target(s), and
“shoot” them by taking a picture with your smartphone camera. If we’re able to
verify that you’ve got the correct target, you win – but at the same time other
snipers may hunting you, and you never know who!</p>
<p>The vision of Social Sniper is
to spawn an entirely new category of games, a category that facilitates and
encourages physical activity and real social interaction. Games that bridge the
gap between the virtual and the real worlds in new ways. We believe that the
technology and concepts behind Social Sniper can enable many other cool gaming
experiences, and we hope to inspire others to use the concepts behind Social
Sniper to create cool new experiences for the community. We have a few of these
ideas ourselves ;-) </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You
Get<br/></b><span>The first version of Social Sniper has been funded and developed entirely
by our small team. Our backend systems, such as the gameplay API, our image
analysis systems, and messaging hubs are fully capable, and built to scale
globally on enterprise grade cloud services. You can download the app for iOS
or Android, and play the game today, however the gameplay offered by our
current front-end (mobile) app is pretty limited, and that is the major focus
for this crowdfunding campaign. </span></p>
<p>For our next release, we want
to re-build the app from scratch, and significantly improve the feature set and
user experience. We will be adding new game types, such as league play, private
teams, play-during-commute mode, as well as weapon selection, body armor,
leveling, proximity alerts, social media integration and much, much more.</p>
<p>By backing this crowdfunding
campaign, you not only become a part of the future category of cross-world
gaming, but you also get the VIP Supporter badge displayed on your Social
Sniper profile for life. We want to make a game you’ll be proud to have backed,
and will take feature requests from contributors, and implement the top (feasible)
requests into the game. Contributions over $20 also get exclusive access to the
top-line sniper rifle, the M200 Intervention. This rifle shoots armor piercing rounds, for ""one shot, one kill"" action regardless of any target body armor. We will never offer a better weapon, and only backers from this campaign will receive it. Once the campaign
is closed, there will be no way to get this weapon again. Ever. </p>
<p><span>If we reach our funding goal,
two new front-end apps (iOS and Android) will be built from scratch, with the
features mentioned. We’ll use the funds to hire additional programmers, to
ensure a rapid progression and high quality UX. We expect to deliver the new
apps within 3 months of campaign closing, and will provide regular updates to
backers. We can project such short timeframes, because we already have our
prototype running, and have dealt with the biggest complexities already. If we
fail to reach our funding goal, <u>we’ll still keep developing Social Sniper</u>
towards our vision. We’ll use the contributed funds to maximum efficiency, and we’ll
work hard to provide additional funding ourselves as well as do more of the development
work in-house, but we’ll get there in the end. Backers will be kept in the loop
on progress, and development time may be extended to 6-12 months, depending on
the funding received. If we exceed our funding goal any additional funds will
be spent on new features and marketing.<span>  </span></span></p>
<p><strong>Who Are We?<br/></strong>The team behind Social Sniper consists of 5 friends, with extensive startup
experience, and diverse, unique and complementary skillsets. <br/>
<strong>Flemming</strong> is the initiator of Social
Sniper, born out of frustration from watching his teenage son sit in front of
the computer for hours on end. An experienced entrepreneur, with over 20 years
of successful business in the mobile and telecommunications field, Flemming is
the powerhouse of go-get energy and can-do attitude.  <br/>
<strong>Jesper</strong> is the multi-talented
business professional, who has taken on the graphic and audio design of Social
Sniper.<br/>
<strong>John</strong> is a former police intelligence
special agent, who brings real world insights and enlightenment to the team. He
is a master of team dynamics and instrumental in creating the immersive
gameplay we want for Social Sniper.<br/>
<strong>Martin</strong> is the resident geek. A tech
entrepreneur for more than 15 years, Martin enjoys envisioning and developing innovative
new concepts as much as he does designing and coding solutions to make them
reality.<br/>
<strong>Paul</strong> is a physical therapist and
acclaimed coach and author, focusing on the mental and physical therapeutic
benefits that can be achieved through games and activities. </p><p>
</p><p><strong>Social Sniper is FREE to download and play, now and forever:</strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to make companies pay to become part of the Social Sniper
game. In “Solo Missions” will all missions be without involment of other
players, such as taking a selfie with a McDonalds employee , take a picture of
a Starbucks coffee etc.</p>
<p>Companies then pay a small fee for this “Hidden” advertising, and also
provide a “Mission Completed” price to the Social Sniper player, for example a
coffee, a hamburger and so on.</p>
<p>Eventually, our backend can be used much more extensively than just the
Social Sniper game, we can make treasure hunts, dating portals, locate lost
items etc., by just adjusting a bit of programming. The possibilities are
endless.</p>
<b>
</b><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong><br/><span>Since we’ve already built our playable prototype of Social Sniper, the
development risks to the project are limited. The most prominent risk is if
development costs were to turn out higher than expected. To a large degree we
are able to mitigate this risk by having full in-house technical knowledge and
development capabilities. By not being dependent on external companies or
consultants for any core parts of our development work we could complete any
commenced work and final changes ourselves, should this situation occur. We
also practically eliminate the risk by being able to provide detailed and
accurate specifications to any external suppliers. All in all, there’s no
scenario where we’re funded, but can’t deliver. </span></p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong><br/><span>We
want Social Sniper to become a community project, and we’re looking for
ambassadors to help spread the word, and promote Social Sniper. If you want to
help set up Social Sniper groups within your city, university, workplace or
other community, please connect with us on Facebook. If you have ideas for
features, spin-offs, or want to collaborate with Social Sniper for your own
project, please reach out as well – we’re always happy to hear from you.</span></p></div>","Why is Social Sniper special? Social Sniper is an attempt to create an entirely new type of online/offline

Social Sniper is FREE to download and play, now and forever:
Our mission is to make companies pay to become part of the Social Sniper
game. In “Solo Missions” will all missions be without involment of other
players, such as taking a selfie with a McDonalds employee , take a picture of
a Starbucks coffee etc.
Companies then pay a small fee for this “Hidden” advertising, and also
provide a “Mission Completed” price to the Social Sniper player, for example a
coffee, a hamburger and so on.
Eventually, our backend can be used much more extensively than just the
Social Sniper game, we can make treasure hunts, dating portals, locate lost
items etc., by just adjusting a bit of programming. The possibilities are
endless.

Risks & ChallengesSince we’ve already built our playable prototype of Social Sniper, the
development risks to the project are limited. The most prominent risk is if
development costs were to turn out higher than expected. To a large degree we
are able to mitigate this risk by having full in-house technical knowledge and
development capabilities. By not being dependent on external companies or
consultants for any core parts of our development work we could complete any
commenced work and final changes ourselves, should this situation occur. We
also practically eliminate the risk by being able to provide detailed and
accurate specifications to any external suppliers. All in all, there’s no
scenario where we’re funded, but can’t deliver. 
Other Ways You Can HelpWe
want Social Sniper to become a community project, and we’re looking for
ambassadors to help spread the word, and promote Social Sniper. If you want to
help set up Social Sniper groups within your city, university, workplace or
other community, please connect with us on Facebook. If you have ideas for
features, spin-offs, or want to collaborate with Social Sniper for your own
project, please reach out as well – we’re always happy to hear from you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span>I was born into a tech family.  My father was an IT guru since before i was born, and has passed most of his knowledge on to me.  I built my first computer when i was about 7, and was playing old SNES side scrollers with my father since i was about 5.  I have loved video games and have played them since then.  It was never enough though.  Over the past 3 years i have been engrossed in learning about games, how they are made, and in turn have seen many come to life.  From classics like mario, to some lesser known like titan quest.  Each game holds a special place in the industry, and now that I have a dedicated and talented team of developers, we can finally make a mark on this amazing industry.</span></p>
<br/>Green Towel Gaming, and DeThrone are two of my latest ventures.  My leadership and guidance in this game will be something probably a little different than most people are used to.  I enjoy taking input from my developers as well as others outside us to help make a more complete game.  So far, the work we have completed has been small compared to the grand scheme of things, but it is a lot considering the amount of time actually put into this.  We do our work fast and efficiently, but most importantly we love what we do.<br/><div><br/></div>

<div>From a young age, I've always been enamored by video games.  It always amazed me how developers could create an entirely new, living world from nothing.  Now, I'm on the front lines of that world creation, and it is an amazing feeling indeed, giving birth to another place.  Art has always been a passion of mine, so when I began 3D modeling, I was able to combine two loves and complete both at the same time.  I've been modeling for the past 5 years, mostly creating mods for myself, and the Steam community.  This year, I've been invited to work on a few projects for developers, and it has been a blast.  Lately, I've been working with Green Towel Gaming, on a start up project to develop a game, as well as working with Eleon game studios on their project ""Empyrion"".  I hope to keep driving toward development of a complete game, because, games, I love em. <br/>

</div></div>","What is Dethrone?Dethrone is a Real time Hack-N-Slash RPG with a first person touch to it.  There will be a number of unique elements but let's focus on the big ones.  Right now my team is dedicated to making an immersive environment, and creating combat the is not only rewarding and interactive, but fun and explosive.  I will dedicate myself to making combat what you once wanted as a kid, or most importantly one that you WILL come back to.What type of combat?most combat will be held in a first person view with the main player controlling powerful hero characters with some unique hack-n-slash combat.  Secondary combat will take place in a real time strategy base Over-The-World Camera Perspective.  The King/Queen, YOU the player, giving orders to Troops or militia to Attack, Defend, or Retreat to or from a position on the map.  Rally points will also be an option to be setting for your troops, but don’t forget your hero, who will be the difference maker as far as combat goes.Why Hack-N-Slash?Have you ever sat back as your units attack the enemy, but wanted to jump into combat and turn the tide of the battle yourself.  Well this will allow you just that.  Take up your hero(custom made by you the player) and your weapons and skills of choice to take on combat like we have yet to see in a video game.  This type of combat will also be really fun in my opinion.  Ever since I played games that had medieval combat, I fell in love, but there wasn't enough progression.What Progression will there be?If you look at some great games over the past 10 years, they had progression.  Whether it was a skill tree, or it was loot, they allowed you to feel like you were growing.  There will be lots of growing in this.  From customizing your castle's abilities, to outfitting your player with special abilities fit for your play style.

I was born into a tech family.  My father was an IT guru since before i was born, and has passed most of his knowledge on to me.  I built my first computer when i was about 7, and was playing old SNES side scrollers with my father since i was about 5.  I have loved video games and have played them since then.  It was never enough though.  Over the past 3 years i have been engrossed in learning about games, how they are made, and in turn have seen many come to life.  From classics like mario, to some lesser known like titan quest.  Each game holds a special place in the industry, and now that I have a dedicated and talented team of developers, we can finally make a mark on this amazing industry.
Green Towel Gaming, and DeThrone are two of my latest ventures.  My leadership and guidance in this game will be something probably a little different than most people are used to.  I enjoy taking input from my developers as well as others outside us to help make a more complete game.  So far, the work we have completed has been small compared to the grand scheme of things, but it is a lot considering the amount of time actually put into this.  We do our work fast and efficiently, but most importantly we love what we do.
Gary ""Embershard"" KinseyBlogger Address - http://embershardsdethroneblog.blogspot.com/                                  (My DeThrone Progress Blog) 
From a young age, I've always been enamored by video games.  It always amazed me how developers could create an entirely new, living world from nothing.  Now, I'm on the front lines of that world creation, and it is an amazing feeling indeed, giving birth to another place.  Art has always been a passion of mine, so when I began 3D modeling, I was able to combine two loves and complete both at the same time.  I've been modeling for the past 5 years, mostly creating mods for myself, and the Steam community.  This year, I've been invited to work on a few projects for developers, and it has been a blast.  Lately, I've been working with Green Towel Gaming, on a start up project to develop a game, as well as working with Eleon game studios on their project ""Empyrion"".  I hope to keep driving toward development of a complete game, because, games, I love em. 







Tier 1: $50,000
Basic Package- Basic funding of this project  guarantees a finished game, at least one environment, two classes, basic character interaction and castle development, and simple progression mechanics.  Funding to this point will ensure that the game gets built.  My time will be dedicated to the project.

Some examples are quest driven missions, heroes, veteran units and a focus on decision making that affects each playthrough!</p><p>Giving the game replay-value is very important for us and we think that great story telling, hours of fun gameplay, dozens of hidden easter eggs and engaging quests is the way to achieve this!</p><p><strong>Platforms: PC, OS X, Linux</strong><br/><strong>Estimated Delivery: January 2018 </strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://indiegogo.loriagame.com/units.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h1>Features &amp; Goals:</h1><h2>Levelable Heroes</h2><p>Your hero will progress and evolve through the game along with your own skills. Collecting powerful items, learning new abilities and accomplishing quests. Heroes will become the heart of your army, leading your soldiers towards the battle!</p><h2>Veteran Units</h2><p>Units are promoted to veterans as a result of combat experience. Your units can be promoted several times, gaining special ability and increasing their skills &amp; attributes. If you manage to keep your soldiers alive long enough, you will get one badass squad of veterans, slicing through your enemies like knife through a butter.</p><h2>Secrets &amp; Easter eggs &amp; Fun!</h2><p>The main story lines in Loria will be serious and well written. However, we are planning to add plenty of easter eggs, jokes and hidden quest-lines for you to find. All with the intent of lightening the mood and bringing something unexpected into the game. We are going to create a colorful palette of surprises for you.

We are adding plenty of shortcuts, features allowing you to group, command and interact with both your units and the world in an intuitive and seamless way. No more clunky controls!</p><h2>RPG Elements</h2><p>We have already introduced many RPG elements to the game - hero units, collecting beneficial items, reactive environments and quest lines that can be completed only with your hero. But we are just getting started! There are plenty of ideas waiting to be implemented.</p><h2>Decision Making</h2><p>Do you enjoy games where your decisions actually matter? Where you can decide to finish a quest line in more than one way, and based upon that decision, gain different allies or objectives? We do. And we certainly want to implement this feature into Loria. The story will not limit you to just one path!</p><h2>Strong Story</h2><p>It is one of the hardest goals to make enthralling and interesting story. However it still is one of the main goals We are hoping to achieve. Most of the funding will be spent towards writing a good story that people will enjoy and get invested in!</p><h2>Multiple Environments</h2><p>Plenty of asset kits are being prepared to create many unique environments.

Is 15% of funding enough? Since this is our love child, we have decided to develop the game without paying any salaries, ensuring that there will always be enough funds to cover all the other requirements, like story, music and art!

The reason for this is that we want to primarily focus on Loria's campaigns. However, even if this funding goal is not reached - we will explore ways of adding multiplayer once first goal is reached and game starts earning some money, so the game will be able to pay for multiplayer itself.</p><h2>45k - New Faction</h2><p>What can make a game more interesting than adding another race! Once this goal is reached, we will create a unique new race with accompanying campaign and of course include it in the multiplayer &amp; skirmish game modes. But what race will be added? The community decides!</p><h2>55k - Co-op Campaign</h2><p>Unfortunately, many modern RTS games do not include co-op campaigns. We love being able to play with our friends and will thus add this functionality upon reaching this goal.<br/><strong>Co-op campaign will be designed for 2 players.</strong></p><h2>80k - Free To Play</h2><p>At this point we believe that we have more-than-accomplished our vision for Loria. Since there is no reason for additional funding, the game will be released free for all RTS fans to enjoy!</p><h2>100k - Codes are Released</h2><p>We will release the game source, so we all can look forward to playing more quality 2D RTS games!

Loria is Classic RTS game inspired by the golden era of strategy games and a love of the classic Warcraft series. Loria aims to take the best concepts from the RTS classics and create a modern user-experience, intelligent AI, smooth controls, pleasing visuals and many hours of quality content that present even experienced players with an honest challenge!The Game introduces a lot of new ideas and plenty of RPG elements. Some examples are quest driven missions, heroes, veteran units and a focus on decision making that affects each playthrough!Giving the game replay-value is very important for us and we think that great story telling, hours of fun gameplay, dozens of hidden easter eggs and engaging quests is the way to achieve this!Platforms: PC, OS X, LinuxEstimated Delivery: January 2018 Features & Goals:Levelable HeroesYour hero will progress and evolve through the game along with your own skills. Collecting powerful items, learning new abilities and accomplishing quests. Heroes will become the heart of your army, leading your soldiers towards the battle!Veteran UnitsUnits are promoted to veterans as a result of combat experience. Your units can be promoted several times, gaining special ability and increasing their skills & attributes. If you manage to keep your soldiers alive long enough, you will get one badass squad of veterans, slicing through your enemies like knife through a butter.Secrets & Easter eggs & Fun!The main story lines in Loria will be serious and well written. However, we are planning to add plenty of easter eggs, jokes and hidden quest-lines for you to find. All with the intent of lightening the mood and bringing something unexpected into the game. We are going to create a colorful palette of surprises for you. There will not be a dull moment in land of Loria!Improved AI90s classics were great for their time. Unfortunately due to hardware limitations, the AI was usually rather boring and predictable. We want to create an intelligent AI system that can surprise you, react to your tactics and present even experienced players with an honest challenge!Improved ControlsOne of our goals is to make sure that the gameplay feels smooth and polished. We are adding plenty of shortcuts, features allowing you to group, command and interact with both your units and the world in an intuitive and seamless way. No more clunky controls!RPG ElementsWe have already introduced many RPG elements to the game - hero units, collecting beneficial items, reactive environments and quest lines that can be completed only with your hero. But we are just getting started! There are plenty of ideas waiting to be implemented.Decision MakingDo you enjoy games where your decisions actually matter? Where you can decide to finish a quest line in more than one way, and based upon that decision, gain different allies or objectives? We do. And we certainly want to implement this feature into Loria. The story will not limit you to just one path!Strong StoryIt is one of the hardest goals to make enthralling and interesting story. However it still is one of the main goals We are hoping to achieve. Most of the funding will be spent towards writing a good story that people will enjoy and get invested in!Multiple EnvironmentsPlenty of asset kits are being prepared to create many unique environments. So that the battlefields, dungeons and forests never feel dull. There will be always something new and beautiful to look at!Well all that talking about how great the game will be made me thirst for some action! Can I actually see some gameplay?Well yes, strange voice in my head! You can.There is already couple of gameplay reviews and you can find the most comprehensive one in the video below:There is also a demo mission, which is free to download at Official website!How Will We Spend The MoneyIndiegogo & RewardsOnly 5% is dedicated to indiegogo - which is standard indiegogo fee. Though it is common to give out plenty of physical rewards, our first and last interest is the game itself. Physical rewards are limited to minimum, so most of the funding is savored towards making the game top-notch.

<p>To consider the game at an Alpha state, I want to make sure that all of the fundamental features are in place. Once we have hit Alpha, it would be possible to play a game from start to finish, even if it is a little rough in places. I am happy to say Aries is nearly there with the only work remaining to tie up the different game modes, so they play together nicely.</p>
<p>Alpha roadmap features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Campaign map: The campaign map will serve as the home of your grand strategy and will be a place for you to build up your army and the systems under your control. By the end of Alpha, the campaign map will allow you to manage all of your planets, build armies, engage in battles, and have hazards for your army to avoid[Done]</li>
<li>General features: All the general features you would expect in a game, this includes a comprehensive options menu, save and load system, and patch installer.[Done]</li>
<li>Research: The research trees will have been fully implemented but may change subject to balancing. [Done]</li>
<li>AI: The AI is a vital part of any strategy game, and we want to make sure ours is a stand out AI that challenges players with smart decisions and not through arbitrary boosts. In Alpha, we want to have our AI making some reasonable calls and to be ready to be updated to use machine learning in Beta.[The AI is a little dumb but puts up a fight]</li>
<li>Battles: We want to be able to play space and ground battles by the end of Alpha, but the AI and balancing of units will likely need significant work in Beta and on the road to launch.[Both fleet and land battles work]</li>
</ul>
<p>Once Alpha is done, we will start work towards Beta and early access. In this period the key focus will be on adding the rest of the units, improving the AI, improving the animations, and making the controls and UI easy to use (Custom Key Bindings!!!). Alongside fleshing out the game and developing this technology, there will also be a lot of balancing of gameplay to be done.</p>

<h3>When will you get the game &amp; how we will keep you up to date</h3>
<p>Early access will begin in 2020, the current plan is for august but we will provide a confirmation in June and will keep you updated between now and then. While lots of games do very early access, I don't believe strategy games do well in them as under polished AI, and UI can be intensely frustrating. Given the current state of the game, I feel that the game should be in a reasonably polished and in an enjoyable state by the beginning of 2021.</p>
<p>Having backed many Kickstarters and IndieGoGo campaigns, I know the frustration of a silent creator. I will provide monthly updates on IndieDB, and will often tweet to let you know I am still alive and working on your game!</p>

<p>All of the significant challenges have been overcome, but the critical risk we face is that the game will fall short of what it could be.</p>

<li>AI is a vital part of the game, and I want to add a neural network component to the games AI so that the difficulty can be based on the skill of the AI and not some arbitrary boost to unit strength. This is a large project, and while I have worked on neural networks before I cannot do this without dedicating an enormous amount of time to the project. </li>

<br/>Who Is The Publisher &amp; What Is This Game?</h3>
<p>Hi!  Thank you very much for viewing this campaign!</p>
<p>I'm Serkan, a 19 year old boy from Germany who finished school last year and fell in love with online marketing in the gaming industry ever since due to my interest in gaming and being self employed. While I just got started with the usual social media marketing in the gaming niche, I quickly figured that releasing and marketing my own video games was super fun and promising for various reasons.</p>
<p>I started to publish pretty simple $0.99 games on Steam first and started to get my first contacts in this scene and a lot of useful knowledge. With my latest project ""Combat Force"" I can finally tell that I am ready to bring this game publishing passion onto a new level!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572188277/f74dsukzncsbcwraerey.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572189903/tot1mi17fxup209kpzsr.png"" src=""""/>
</h2>
<p><b>Combat Force will aim towards offering the end customer and unbelievable amount of value for the purchasing price of $3.99 (we will have a 25% launch discount for the first release week which means that the game will be available for $2.99 during that time)</b></p>
<p>It will offer a zombie survival mode with 2 awesome maps, various weapons and several features such as barricades, power-ups and upgrades/perks. Although the game can be compared to the Call of Duty Black Ops zombies mode, we will have a bunch of key differences which make it feel way different than the Call of Duty example. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571758961/fw3pka3q3etz7kuvedgu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Aside from that, our goal is also to release a well-designed single player campaign which adds a deeper meaning to the zombie mode and also gives the game itself a story-line.</p>
<p><strong>During the launch on Steam (on the 6th December) - the game will only have the zombie mode and sandbox mode but the mentioned single player campaign, multiplayer modes and various updates to the zombie and sandbox mode are scheduled.</strong></p>
<p>The reason behind it is that I only have 1 developer working with me right now. His name is Matt and he is a 19 year old friend of mine who lives in the US. He is a fairly talented guy, especially for his age and also gets some help with map design and certain parts of the coding from his contacts. </p>
<p>Now that we are less than 2 months away from the initial release on Steam, we start to find more and more graphical assets which would fit into the game well and improve it a lot and also start to realize how big of a deal a proper marketing campaign will be where I should definitely go all out.</p>
<p><strong>Financing the game and a good marketing campaign on my own would lead to limitations and mediocre results, it would open up a worst case scenario where I would have to burn through my cash way too fast if many problems occur. </strong></p>
<p><strong>That's why I decided to host this Indiegogo campaign since it would be awesome to simply have a higher budget for the game development and just some kind of financial buffer/support from other's who genuinely believe in our idea or just feel generous. </strong></p>
<p>Once the zombie mode and single player campaign were updated and maintained well for a couple weeks or months and we were able to work well towards improvements with the help of community feedback, we will also start to implement <strong>an online multiplayer mode</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOU </strong>as a contributer would help me to master this game release since you would make it possible for us to significantly increase the game quality and also help out with a security buffer for us whenever unexpected expenses come up which involve Combat Force.</p>
<p><strong>Also I came up with some creative ideas to reward contributors of this campaign with some special rewards such as free game copies and other cool gifts/perks!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Where the money will go and what you will get!<br/> </h3>
<p><strong>For the distribution of the raised money, me and my developer came up with a simple agreement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>75% will straight up flow into game quality improvements which were the main goal of this campaign. With that being said, this money is used to increase our budget for ingame assets (such as textures, sounds and certain mechanics) and once we took care of that, the rest will most likely flow into other aspects like improving the Steam store page or into the general marketing budget</li>
<li>25% goes to my developer as an additional payment since he is putting more time and effort into this project than we both expected so I would love to make it worth his time!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A list of various rewards for contributing to this campaign: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Beta access copies to Combat Force for you and your friends!</li>
<li>Normal copies once Combat Force releases for you and your friends!</li>
<li>A special contributor role on our Discord server (<a href=""https://discord.gg/Hpbfz5S"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://discord.gg/Hpbfz5S</a>)</li>
<li>Getting yourself a little easteregg inside of the game (like your name being displayed somewhere on the map)</li>
<li>Getting added to a contributors list which will be place on our Steam group discussions</li>
<li>A personal thank you!</li>
</ul>

Who Is The Publisher & What Is This Game?
Hi!  Thank you very much for viewing this campaign!
I'm Serkan, a 19 year old boy from Germany who finished school last year and fell in love with online marketing in the gaming industry ever since due to my interest in gaming and being self employed. While I just got started with the usual social media marketing in the gaming niche, I quickly figured that releasing and marketing my own video games was super fun and promising for various reasons.
I started to publish pretty simple $0.99 games on Steam first and started to get my first contacts in this scene and a lot of useful knowledge. With my latest project ""Combat Force"" I can finally tell that I am ready to bring this game publishing passion onto a new level!
 



Combat Force will aim towards offering the end customer and unbelievable amount of value for the purchasing price of $3.99 (we will have a 25% launch discount for the first release week which means that the game will be available for $2.99 during that time)
It will offer a zombie survival mode with 2 awesome maps, various weapons and several features such as barricades, power-ups and upgrades/perks. Although the game can be compared to the Call of Duty Black Ops zombies mode, we will have a bunch of key differences which make it feel way different than the Call of Duty example. 
Aside from that, our goal is also to release a well-designed single player campaign which adds a deeper meaning to the zombie mode and also gives the game itself a story-line.
During the launch on Steam (on the 6th December) - the game will only have the zombie mode and sandbox mode but the mentioned single player campaign, multiplayer modes and various updates to the zombie and sandbox mode are scheduled.
The reason behind it is that I only have 1 developer working with me right now. His name is Matt and he is a 19 year old friend of mine who lives in the US. He is a fairly talented guy, especially for his age and also gets some help with map design and certain parts of the coding from his contacts. 
Now that we are less than 2 months away from the initial release on Steam, we start to find more and more graphical assets which would fit into the game well and improve it a lot and also start to realize how big of a deal a proper marketing campaign will be where I should definitely go all out.
Financing the game and a good marketing campaign on my own would lead to limitations and mediocre results, it would open up a worst case scenario where I would have to burn through my cash way too fast if many problems occur. 
That's why I decided to host this Indiegogo campaign since it would be awesome to simply have a higher budget for the game development and just some kind of financial buffer/support from other's who genuinely believe in our idea or just feel generous. 
Once the zombie mode and single player campaign were updated and maintained well for a couple weeks or months and we were able to work well towards improvements with the help of community feedback, we will also start to implement an online multiplayer mode
YOU as a contributer would help me to master this game release since you would make it possible for us to significantly increase the game quality and also help out with a security buffer for us whenever unexpected expenses come up which involve Combat Force.
Also I came up with some creative ideas to reward contributors of this campaign with some special rewards such as free game copies and other cool gifts/perks!
 
 
 

Where the money will go and what you will get! 
For the distribution of the raised money, me and my developer came up with a simple agreement:

75% will straight up flow into game quality improvements which were the main goal of this campaign. With that being said, this money is used to increase our budget for ingame assets (such as textures, sounds and certain mechanics) and once we took care of that, the rest will most likely flow into other aspects like improving the Steam store page or into the general marketing budget
25% goes to my developer as an additional payment since he is putting more time and effort into this project than we both expected so I would love to make it worth his time!

A list of various rewards for contributing to this campaign: 

Beta access copies to Combat Force for you and your friends!
Normal copies once Combat Force releases for you and your friends!
A special contributor role on our Discord server (https://discord.gg/Hpbfz5S)
Getting yourself a little easteregg inside of the game (like your name being displayed somewhere on the map)
Getting added to a contributors list which will be place on our Steam group discussions
A personal thank you!

 
Additional rewards for huge contributors:

A spot in the official game credits as ""top contributors""
High priority contact with us including exclusive insights, a special involvement with the game and more! 



The Impact you will make by supporting us!
By supporting my first big attempt to step into the game publisher industry you will become one of the early supporters who actively contributed to making this dream come true.
Without you this probably wouldn't be possible so I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart since every contributor or simply visitor of this campaign is highly appreciated! 
I'll never forget your help! 
 

Future goals and challenges
For the game release, quality improvements and general marketing we already have a good roadmap so we can assure that the raise money will be used as efficient as possible.
Once we had a fairly successful game launch, our next goal will be to interact with our community as good as possible and genuinely listen to our supporters and fans to properly maintain the game with regular fixes and updates which are appreciated by the player base!
To establish a perfect relation with our community, we have a Steam group and a Discord server for announcements and discussions and also plan on releasing a website with forums for Combat Force.

<p>Hello, my name is <strong>Alex Monfort Ferrer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Randy &amp; Manilla </strong>is a game project that for years I wanted to do it with the company of people dedicated to the indie sector of video games and art, and I would like to have a great support in <strong>Indiegogo</strong> so that it can become a reality to be able to develop this indie project that has occurred to me in the best way possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574534793/whptaaackbesr4fewc87.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>On the year <strong>2142</strong>, In the mysterious interior of the quantum supercomputer created by <strong>Lambert Wilson</strong>, there is a cyber-universe surrounded by a brightly colored cubes called ""<strong>Net-Cubes</strong>"" that inside have a fantastic virtual worlds of pixelated structures, abstract and even in various ways. It is free from threats like hackers, cyber-spies and corporate and government organizations. But that doesn't mean that they have their own threats, such as the villain of the red Net-Cube, ""<strong>Cracksom Virus</strong>"" a dominant virus that puts all Net-Cubes in danger of being permanently eliminated to be able to expand his empire of computing corruption to the real world left by humans.</p>
<p>Then a message algorithm called ""<strong>E-Mailer</strong>"" arrives at the world of ""<strong>Bloxland Qubitown</strong>"", the home of <strong>Randy and Manilla</strong>, giving them an urgent notice that the entire cyber-universe is in a big danger of being destroyed by <strong>Cracksom</strong>, because he knows that they are the only ones who can stop their great threat, and they accepted the mission and they will embark on a great adventure about the different Net-Cubes, but E-Mailer will also accompany and open them portals to access the new worlds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574534916/fb8h6mwjwo3uspsbinyl.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>Randy Qubit Pix-It:</strong> Bold, somewhat brave and motivated. Their power ups are of fireballs and strength, which can remove obstacles and many enemies.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574535001/r8uskp1emdzdqij8yqvi.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Manilla Von-It:</strong> The younger sister, cheerful, optimistic. Her power ups are speed, which can run, give quick attacks and mini-teleports that pass through glass walls and fences. In a few phases it will run similar to <strong>Sonic</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574535090/cm21dx55yrp54zis5uug.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>E-Mailer</strong>: The Messenger Algorithm that sends emails through all Net-cubes of the supercomputer. When he warns of a virus danger (such as <strong>Cracksom</strong>), he goes to alert Randy, Manilla or any other hero to motivate them to save Net-cubes from the impending disaster.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574536894/ttw1wysrb3fgpuena220.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Each selectable Net-Cube of the game, represents and refers to a certain videogame genres (<strong>RPG, Platform, Arcade, Shoote</strong>r, etc.), with distinctive colors compared to most (behind will be shown a screenshot of a very early prototype version of what it consists of).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574537135/imvh7o1hhbbzxmegdtiy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> The two cubes in blue a little less clear, will possibly be the selectable worlds.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575288323/hpxl5oxttrga2dazjeyj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Upon entering inside of the Net-Cubes, they are also the entry to discover the worlds of its interior to that these game genres represent. Such for example <strong>Terra-Qubit</strong>, where the levels are of the platforms genre accompanied by a retro and pixelated mosaic aesthetic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574633342/nt8ifbgrk7yifqdyg9tu.png"" src=""""/></p>

<div>
<div><p> </p></div>
<p>To better understand about its important role that represent the <strong>Net-Cubes</strong> for the game itself, I have made a short video about the alpha demo of the project.</p>
<p>In this you can make a free travel on the cyber-universe surrounded by Net-Cubes of various colors driving with a ship, when entering on the brown Net-Cube, the screen menu with the title of the world (<strong>Terra-Qubit</strong>) is activated as if it were another videogame inside it, going through an interactive stage of the map of the levels based on the gender of the platforms, in the first level (of the blue tile) the camera follows the character with a perspective similar to <strong>Super Mario 3D Land / 3D World</strong>, making reference to the <strong>3D linear platforms</strong>. And the basic object for a platform game that helps follow the player, They are bright yellow cubes called ""<strong>Net-Points</strong>"" that when you pick them up, he get points that fill the score, and there is also a <strong>Power-Up</strong> that is activated at the right time to defeat enemies and reach the goal.</p>
<p>In the second example, the ship go through the Net-Cube of <strong>Wonder Race</strong>, The colorful racing Net-Cube where it represents the genre of <strong>racing and runner levels</strong>, where can we play as <strong>Manilla</strong>, starting a <strong>Test Level </strong>of a 3D speedy platformer with her power-ups that can collect, activate and use to defeat enemies, obstacles and go jump the cliffs, in addition to a challenging <strong>2D Runner level </strong>with 3D Effect.</p>
<p>And in the last example, the ship go through the Net-Cube of <strong>Blacksquare Qubit-Battle</strong>, a dark place where it represents the shooter genre and high difficulty. When Randy step on a green tile, it take to a level with the basics of an FPS, with shooting fire &amp; a first person camera which makes it seem like it feels like playing in the skin of the main character (a bit like <strong>Mirror Edges</strong>).</p>
<p>With these three examples you can give a better idea that the game is a multi-genre.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574537277/dfdfijfb3in3tv21mmvt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This indie game project, being partly multi-genre, it could host many <strong>classic game references</strong>, also the dark and post-apocalyptic origin on a supercomputer with Net-Cubes that stores memories of humanity before its extinction, may have some touch of <strong>Ready Player One</strong>, but taken to an even farther future, and several virtual environments would also have the simple and funny style of <strong>Wreck-It Ralph</strong> (specially by the main characters, and the game title its obvioulsy a reference).</p>
<p> </p>

<p>The first version of the game (<strong>Pre-Alpha</strong>), was released in <strong>October 2019</strong> made only by me, for the <strong>Alpha</strong> version in <strong>November</strong> of the same year, it has been developed with a group of 3 persons:</p>

<p>I loved creating this game, and that it is well known enough for much of the gaming communities.</p>
<p>The objective of this campaign is to obtain the necessary support and recognition so that the project could move forward to obtain a better and more advanced development result, and having these necessary parts fulfilled, the possibility of being put on sale will be opened.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if it fails to reach that goal, it would never reach that stage of development and recognition, or it will simply get more economical development materials with the funds obtained without having reached its goal.<br/><br/>Once the campaign has been successful, the work will be distributed in several of the important sections for the development of the game project, depending on its complexity and the time to complete:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574538152/rmzx4jrupkle1qfyckma.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And in case the campaign manages to exceed its objective, it would also have the possibility that the project may include additional elements that improve the details <strong>(such as better models and more advanced programming, extra modes, better distribution, animated short films for cutscenes, etc.).</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574540610/lswt6cuhilpqufnkjspo.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>There will be a perks for the sponsors who contribute the most in this project campaign that will be sent by email and download by the end of the campaign and the game demos for later shown in this image of bottom:</p>

<p>As an additional point, there will also be a unique and <strong>great physical reward</strong> for those who choose a larger contribution.</p>

<p>Your contribution can be very important for the <strong>Randy &amp; Manilla</strong> project, it means an important step for the path to its success and to obtain a better quality of development, it would be something that can help a lot</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the problems that prevents me from making this project come true, is that if I don't get a sufficient number of sponsorships and donors of this campaign, the development of this project will never be completed, and not even be able to get the necessary development team sufficiently trained so that the development of the game project has the highest quality possible.</p>
<p>If I fail to beat these two challenges, this project would will run the risk of being paused or canceled. So, please, support me in making the development of this great Indie videogame project come true. It would be very helpful if your great support makes this project a reality and can overcome these obstacles.</p>

It is free from threats like hackers, cyber-spies and corporate and government organizations. But that doesn't mean that they have their own threats, such as the villain of the red Net-Cube, ""Cracksom Virus"" a dominant virus that puts all Net-Cubes in danger of being permanently eliminated to be able to expand his empire of computing corruption to the real world left by humans.
Then a message algorithm called ""E-Mailer"" arrives at the world of ""Bloxland Qubitown"", the home of Randy and Manilla, giving them an urgent notice that the entire cyber-universe is in a big danger of being destroyed by Cracksom, because he knows that they are the only ones who can stop their great threat, and they accepted the mission and they will embark on a great adventure about the different Net-Cubes, but E-Mailer will also accompany and open them portals to access the new worlds.
 


Randy Qubit Pix-It: Bold, somewhat brave and motivated. Their power ups are of fireballs and strength, which can remove obstacles and many enemies.

Manilla Von-It: The younger sister, cheerful, optimistic. Her power ups are speed, which can run, give quick attacks and mini-teleports that pass through glass walls and fences. In a few phases it will run similar to Sonic.
 

E-Mailer: The Messenger Algorithm that sends emails through all Net-cubes of the supercomputer. When he warns of a virus danger (such as Cracksom), he goes to alert Randy, Manilla or any other hero to motivate them to save Net-cubes from the impending disaster.
 


Each selectable Net-Cube of the game, represents and refers to a certain videogame genres (RPG, Platform, Arcade, Shooter, etc.), with distinctive colors compared to most (behind will be shown a screenshot of a very early prototype version of what it consists of).
 

 The two cubes in blue a little less clear, will possibly be the selectable worlds.

Upon entering inside of the Net-Cubes, they are also the entry to discover the worlds of its interior to that these game genres represent. Such for example Terra-Qubit, where the levels are of the platforms genre accompanied by a retro and pixelated mosaic aesthetic.
 



 
To better understand about its important role that represent the Net-Cubes for the game itself, I have made a short video about the alpha demo of the project.
In this you can make a free travel on the cyber-universe surrounded by Net-Cubes of various colors driving with a ship, when entering on the brown Net-Cube, the screen menu with the title of the world (Terra-Qubit) is activated as if it were another videogame inside it, going through an interactive stage of the map of the levels based on the gender of the platforms, in the first level (of the blue tile) the camera follows the character with a perspective similar to Super Mario 3D Land / 3D World, making reference to the 3D linear platforms. And the basic object for a platform game that helps follow the player, They are bright yellow cubes called ""Net-Points"" that when you pick them up, he get points that fill the score, and there is also a Power-Up that is activated at the right time to defeat enemies and reach the goal.
In the second example, the ship go through the Net-Cube of Wonder Race, The colorful racing Net-Cube where it represents the genre of racing and runner levels, where can we play as Manilla, starting a Test Level of a 3D speedy platformer with her power-ups that can collect, activate and use to defeat enemies, obstacles and go jump the cliffs, in addition to a challenging 2D Runner level with 3D Effect.
And in the last example, the ship go through the Net-Cube of Blacksquare Qubit-Battle, a dark place where it represents the shooter genre and high difficulty. When Randy step on a green tile, it take to a level with the basics of an FPS, with shooting fire & a first person camera which makes it seem like it feels like playing in the skin of the main character (a bit like Mirror Edges).
With these three examples you can give a better idea that the game is a multi-genre.

 

This indie game project, being partly multi-genre, it could host many classic game references, also the dark and post-apocalyptic origin on a supercomputer with Net-Cubes that stores memories of humanity before its extinction, may have some touch of Ready Player One, but taken to an even farther future, and several virtual environments would also have the simple and funny style of Wreck-It Ralph (specially by the main characters, and the game title its obvioulsy a reference).
 

The first version of the game (Pre-Alpha), was released in October 2019 made only by me, for the Alpha version in November of the same year, it has been developed with a group of 3 persons:
Alex Monfort Ferrer (Ofihombre)
From Gata de Gorgos (Spain)
Me, the creator, director, writer, designer and main programmer of the project.
 
Skyrider
Of Central Europe
Designer of 3D Models by Hobbie, He is the one who designed the Manilla and Venny Loopsuit models, and also fan-made models of Wreck-It Ralph and Hotel Transilvania.
 
Jake Gamelin (Donnie Rush)
From San Diego (California, USA)
Music composer, is who has composed the first 3 soundtracks of Randy & Manilla.
 


I loved creating this game, and that it is well known enough for much of the gaming communities.
The objective of this campaign is to obtain the necessary support and recognition so that the project could move forward to obtain a better and more advanced development result, and having these necessary parts fulfilled, the possibility of being put on sale will be opened.
Otherwise, if it fails to reach that goal, it would never reach that stage of development and recognition, or it will simply get more economical development materials with the funds obtained without having reached its goal.Once the campaign has been successful, the work will be distributed in several of the important sections for the development of the game project, depending on its complexity and the time to complete:

And in case the campaign manages to exceed its objective, it would also have the possibility that the project may include additional elements that improve the details (such as better models and more advanced programming, extra modes, better distribution, animated short films for cutscenes, etc.).
 

There will be a perks for the sponsors who contribute the most in this project campaign that will be sent by email and download by the end of the campaign and the game demos for later shown in this image of bottom:

As an additional point, there will also be a unique and great physical reward for those who choose a larger contribution.

 


Your contribution can be very important for the Randy & Manilla project, it means an important step for the path to its success and to obtain a better quality of development, it would be something that can help a lot

Risks & Challenges
One of the problems that prevents me from making this project come true, is that if I don't get a sufficient number of sponsorships and donors of this campaign, the development of this project will never be completed, and not even be able to get the necessary development team sufficiently trained so that the development of the game project has the highest quality possible.
If I fail to beat these two challenges, this project would will run the risk of being paused or canceled. So, please, support me in making the development of this great Indie videogame project come true. It would be very helpful if your great support makes this project a reality and can overcome these obstacles.

This project has been in development for a little over a year now. I've been putting as much effort as possible into making a unique video game experience that revives the love of story telling in a 2D platformer. This has been a huge dream of mine since I was very young, but this is also about bringing game developers and gamers alike together in my local town, Gulfport, MS.   Trials & Treasures I am looking for a minimum of $2000 which is just enough to cover 3 months of survival so that the game can be priority number one.
Funding received will go towards bills. To make this game a reality, electricity and internet is required if it is to be completed on time.

Even if the goal is not reached, any funding received will still be used to cover any portion of bills that would allow work on the game to continue.


    Revealing Potential This project is about more than just me releasing a game, it's also about bringing a game development scene to the Mississippi Gulf Coast. This area is a wasteland when it comes to came design and development and I would like to change that.  I want gamers and developers in my hometown to know that they can share their own creativity with the world by creating and contributing to games developed within their home community. There is a lot of potential on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and I would like gamers, developers, and artists to see that potential and make it come to life.

<p>Hello Lunar Fans!</p>
<p>My name is Sean David and I have been a Lunar Fan for over 20 years now. Just like you I waited for a true sequel of the real Lunar Games. So many years have past, and I decided to do what ever I can to help that we finally get a new Lunar game. In the last 4 weeks I got pretty far. I got the confirmation of many original staff members that they would love to return. We gathered more than 2000 votes of Lunar Fans who would love to see a third game. My goal is to gather 10000 votes to show ""Game Arts"" that there is still a great fan base and that we all want Lunar 3. But in order for us to finally contact Game Arts we need to mobilise more Fans. And this is not as easy. The most efficient way so far was to run ads on all social media platforms. But this coasts a lot of money. I have spent a lot of money out of my own pocket, and of course my resources are also limited. So I am hoping you guys can support me in order to run more ads, and to mobilise more fans!</p>

My goal is to gather 10000 votes to show ""Game Arts"" that there is still a great fan base and that we all want Lunar 3. But in order for us to finally contact Game Arts we need to mobilise more Fans. And this is not as easy. The most efficient way so far was to run ads on all social media platforms. But this coasts a lot of money. I have spent a lot of money out of my own pocket, and of course my resources are also limited. So I am hoping you guys can support me in order to run more ads, and to mobilise more fans!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The biggest strategic challenge is to balance your villager's professions so that your village stays productive both in peace and in war. It is good for every villager to know many skills. This way you can maintain a healthy and functioning village. Your villagers are happiest doing the tasks they are the best at but remember if your villager's task changes multiple times, your villager's happiness will decrease. When war breaks out, your villagers don't know how to fight without military training from a good leader. But in times of peace, your villagers will not be able to gather enough resources if you focus only just that the war might be coming. From the family tree  you can view at the lineage of each villager. From there you can see the parents of every villager and their basic information such as name, age and cause of death. By looking at the lineage and skill tree you can give each and every villager a task where they are the best at.

<li>The casing and all related plastic parts require injection molding with an above-average quality, because of the small size and details. Such injection molds are really more expensive. The only way to reduce the cost per unit is thus to increase the quantities</li>
<li>We have to order more than 1000 assembled PCBs if we want to obtain a reasonable price</li>
<li>Moreover, most of the electronic components on the PCB have minimum order quantities of 1000-5000 piece full reels</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>This is why we must reach at least 1000 orders in order to make this incredible price possible!</p><p>Hardware development is done, everything is ready: 3Dmodels are done, PCB design is done, and manufacturers are ready to get started.</p><p>The only thing that is missing is a 1000 pieces order! What the FunKey Project needs now is you guys!</p><p>Back us now and help us reach our fundraising goal so that it will become reality!</p><p> </p><p><u>Software challenge</u>:</p><p>No risks there, all software developments are done internally, we (and you!) have total control on what is done since:</p><ul>
<li>It is Open Source Software!</li>
<li>We have the technical expertise to deal with it, from the low-level bootloader intrisics up to the high-level graphics and application layers, with years of experience in embedded development</li>
<li>We expect the software to get a lot of momentum in the future, as plan to share all our mods as Open Source as well and provide an SDK (Software Development Kit) for external developers</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>We developed ourselves from scratch a dedicated embedded Linux operating system called “FunKey-OS”, based on the “buildroot” tool, rather than using a popular Linux distro out of the box. This choice was made in order to optimize speed and performance in order to maximum the hardware resources available.</p><p>We used numerous other Open Source packages as well, all forked and built from the sources, with an emphasis on respecting the original licenses and sharing our mods upstream whenever applicable.</p><p>We did many improvements:</p><p>- “fbtft”Linux kernel display driver optimizations:</p><ul>
<li>Hardware DMA + Async kernel threads for SPI in order to reach the maximum theoritical refresh rate on these types of screen: 50hz.</li>
<li>Copy-less double-buffering: no CPU overhead.</li>
<li>Sync with screen display refresh in order to avoid tearing</li>
<li>Overlay layer for text notifications and battery status</li>
</ul><p>- U-Boot bootloader an Linux kernel boot time optimizations</p><p>- Composite (Ethernet + Mass Storage) USB device driver configuration with cable insert detection</p><p>- Dedicated GPIO to key mapping service</p><p>- Pixel transparency in the SDL library</p><p>- RetroFE front-end enhancements:</p><ul>
<li>Back-ported the to SDL 1.2 library to get rid of the OpenGL depency o Non-linear tweens</li>
<li>Fast scrolling</li>
<li>Dithering</li>
<li>Scrollable text in all directions</li>
<li>Image prescalling and cache</li>
<li>FunKey easy menu system</li>
</ul><p>- Many retro gaming console emulator improvements:</p><ul>
<li>Display speed optimizations</li>
<li>Fast bilinear display rescaling</li>
<li>Game backup/restore system for ""Instant Play""</li>
<li>CPU and floating point vector optimizations o Quick Action Keys</li>
<li>FunKey consistent menu system</li>
</ul><p> </p><p><strong>About the shipping</strong>:</p><p>Because of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, shipping costs have increased in a major way, however, we believe these prices should be back to normal as the health situation improves. In order to minimise costs for you, our backers, we will not be charging the current higher shipping charges at the time of pledging. The FunKey S will ship from Shenzhen in China with the best possible care. To avoid any delivery problems we will declare full value of the products. Shipping and taxes will be calculated and paid for towards the end of the campaign, just before we ship out to our backers.</p><p>We will be working hard to secure you the best shipping prices. Please provide a phone number for delivery, failure to do so might prevent successful delivery</p><p> </p><p><strong>Remarks</strong>:</p><p> </p><p>- The FunKey S comes with our own pre-installed software with a number of retro gaming console emulators and some free (as in Freedom) games. We expect the number of emulators to grow in the future, as we plan to open the FunKey platform to external developers</p></div>","Maybe it's the nostalgia or the pixel-art design, but retrogaming makes everyone feel something unique and personal. What if you could play all your favorite retro games on a real handheld console, anywhere, anytime? Meet the FunKey S, the world's smallest foldable handheld console. The FunKey S is tiny enough to fit on your keychain, while powerful and comfortable enough to let you play thousands of retro games. You won't need to think about bringing another device with you in the morning, it's already there with you!   It is now ready for production and only a few weeks away from bringing you a unique and awesome way to play your favorite retro games. You don't have to take our word for it, early reviews speak for themselves: 

 
We need you now to make the FunKey S a reality, help us with the very last step of this journey and be among the very first to experience retrogaming in style anywhere, anytime!
 
  The FunKey S is currently available in three different stunning colors :Atomic Purple, Retrogaming Gray and Original Purple.  The most incredible aspect about the FunKey S is its size: we've designed it to be the perfect invisible companion for your everyday life. Thanks to it compactness, you can now have a powerful handheld console always attached to your keychain.  You'll never forget to bring it with you and won't even notice it's there, but when nostalgia calls and makes you remember an unbeaten boss, or an unfinished level, just pop it open and be ready to kick some ass!  Bored in transports, sleeping in class or simply having a few minutes to kill? Give yourself a well-deserved retrogaming break!  Everybody remembers how old clamshell mobile phones and consoles used to snap closed or pop open. The FunKey S is based on the same concept of active spring-powered hinge. This foldable design brings two important features: 
Closed, the console naturally turns into a sturdy protective shell, no better way to protect the screen.
Opened, the console doubles its size to offer the largest possible screen and controls.
  Also, we've added a sensor for detecting when the console closes or opens so that it will automatically save your game and power off or turn on the console and start back your game! We call this instant play and you won't believe how it makes everything easier, but read on for the full explanation later.   Don't be fooled by its size, the FunKey S is powerful!  Be ready to discover - or rediscover - all your favorite classics. Already a dozen of retro consoles is playable on the FunKey S right now and the list won't stop growing: NES, SNES, Gameboy, Gameboy Color, Gameboy advance, Sega Master System, Sega Genesis (Megadrive), Sega Game Gear, Playstation 1, Atary Lynx, WonderSwan, Neo Geo Pocket.   Small is cute but - thanks to its foldable design - small also means comfortable once the console is opened.    We've made the most out of the FunKey S' foldable design: not only is it able to detect when it opens or closes, but the gaming experience is completely optimized for it.Close the console and it will automatically save your game before turning itself off.  Open it and your game will start back in less than 5 seconds right where you left it!  We've also added this feature when the battery is too low or when you turn off the console manually, so whether it’s because you had to grab your coffee or ran out of juice, don’t be afraid to lose your adventure because we guarantee that you won’t!You won't believe how instant play makes everything easier and for those of you who regularly play with current gen retro consoles, you'll have a hard time going back to not using this feature, believe us!   On the FunKey S what matters above all is providing the best possible gaming experience.A whole new distribution called FunKey-OS has been built from scratch for an optimized, unified and clean experience so that you can focus on gaming and not get frustrated with the rest. Forget about multiple settings menus with different options and button mappings depending on one emulator or another. Forget about bloatware!Just. The. Essential.  

Boot under 5 seconds and start back your games right where you left them.
Enjoy a simple and consistent settings menu throughout the whole system.
Pressing the Fn button triggers the same quick shortcuts from anywhere.
System-wide notifications make everything clear for gamers and easy for developers.
Connect your console and add new games as simply as you would do it with a simple USB memory stick.
Easily access your saved files alongside your games to share or back them up.
 Upgrade the system without headaches by simply copying/pasting one file and rebooting.
Create/share new and amazing themes for the launcher with a simple text editor.
No unnecessary softwares out of the box (text editors, mp3 players...), but the software being open source, developers can easily add their own.
  Everything is easy and fast so that you just need to focus on gaming.

  Since its origins, the FunKey S has proudly been Open Hardware & Open Source.   Many designs and tutorials are already online on Hackaday and we commit to keep every aspect of the FunKey S open.   This means providing tutorials and putting in public repositories on Github:
All electronic design & production files
The whole FunKey-OS distribution
All launcher & emulator source files
All 3D-printable STL files for the casing
 Basically, you have the keys!   The FunKey S is the fruit of years of passionate work. If you're curious here is a glance at the whole story: at the beginning was Keymu, an original concept of a cute, foldable handheld console, tiny enough to fit on anyone’s keychain, but powerful and comfortable enough to let you play thousands of retro games.Keymu was only a prototype developed in a garage over 3 years ago, but it received an unexpected and overwhelming attention. Keymu's unscripted video got millions of views on Youtube, tech medias picked up the buzz and dozens of articles were written, encouraging us to produce it…Your enthusiasm captured our attention and made us want to work for this unique console to actually see the light of day outside of our garage.  We love reading your excitement and thoughts regarding our work. Want to discuss FunKey? Come over on our social medias, our website, or drop us a line here on Indiegogo, we'll promise to pay attention to your questions or remarks and respond asap! It is thanks to your support and comments that the FunKey S is so close to become a reality and we could not be more grateful!The end of the road is very near now and we need you more than ever!  Indiegogo is a crowdfunding platform where people support creative makers and entrepreneurs by pre-ordering unique products for later shipment.The InDemand program is the opportunity for successful campaigns to keep in touch with their community and let the chance to new people to have their hands on the product.How to order :

 As stated in the introduction, we are ready for production. This means we have contacted multiple electro-mechanical manufacturers, got several quotes, evaluated their reliability and pinpointed the ones we'll partner with during production. Most of them are very excited about this project as well.This also means, we have designed and prepared every detail up until the design of the packaging, the leaflet, the accessories in the box, the shipping company...Basically, you'll get what you pledged for. No worries about this issue.    We could not have achieved this project without the help and support of very amazing people. First and foremost, the biggest shoutout is to our family and friends, putting up with the good and hard times, without whom we would not have made it this far.Thanks Fabien for your amazing artistic vision, and Damien for painting our prototypes with such accuracy, you're a real airbrush worker. Big up to our young actors Samuel and Ethan, who displayed real talent for acting while playing video games, or maybe it's the other way around! Thanks to Valeria, Adeline and Luc for delivering Italian, Spanish and German subtitles in such a short notice ! Your contribution makes our work even more international.Thumbs up to Todd Haskell, the voice of the video, and the GG Riggs band for the amazing music behind it!Thanks to all the different media, influencers, Youtubers who talked about us and shared our project. In particular, thank you RetroDodo for being among the very first to reach us on Twitter and test our prototype objectively.And last but not least, to the amazing community of retrogamers behind this project: THANK YOU. You welcomed the FunKey S in such a fantastic way, through your subscriptions, shares, likes, comments, feedbacks... We might have brought the project, but you made it shine. Thanks for that. RISKS & CHALLENGESProduction challenge:In order to make this gaming console so affordable we must reach our fundraising goal because:
The casing and all related plastic parts require injection molding with an above-average quality, because of the small size and details. Such injection molds are really more expensive. The only way to reduce the cost per unit is thus to increase the quantities
We have to order more than 1000 assembled PCBs if we want to obtain a reasonable price
Moreover, most of the electronic components on the PCB have minimum order quantities of 1000-5000 piece full reels
 This is why we must reach at least 1000 orders in order to make this incredible price possible!Hardware development is done, everything is ready: 3Dmodels are done, PCB design is done, and manufacturers are ready to get started.The only thing that is missing is a 1000 pieces order! What the FunKey Project needs now is you guys!Back us now and help us reach our fundraising goal so that it will become reality! Software challenge:No risks there, all software developments are done internally, we (and you!) have total control on what is done since:
It is Open Source Software!
We have the technical expertise to deal with it, from the low-level bootloader intrisics up to the high-level graphics and application layers, with years of experience in embedded development
We expect the software to get a lot of momentum in the future, as plan to share all our mods as Open Source as well and provide an SDK (Software Development Kit) for external developers
 We developed ourselves from scratch a dedicated embedded Linux operating system called “FunKey-OS”, based on the “buildroot” tool, rather than using a popular Linux distro out of the box. This choice was made in order to optimize speed and performance in order to maximum the hardware resources available.We used numerous other Open Source packages as well, all forked and built from the sources, with an emphasis on respecting the original licenses and sharing our mods upstream whenever applicable.We did many improvements:- “fbtft”Linux kernel display driver optimizations:
Hardware DMA + Async kernel threads for SPI in order to reach the maximum theoritical refresh rate on these types of screen: 50hz.
Copy-less double-buffering: no CPU overhead.
Sync with screen display refresh in order to avoid tearing
Overlay layer for text notifications and battery status
- U-Boot bootloader an Linux kernel boot time optimizations- Composite (Ethernet + Mass Storage) USB device driver configuration with cable insert detection- Dedicated GPIO to key mapping service- Pixel transparency in the SDL library- RetroFE front-end enhancements:
Back-ported the to SDL 1.2 library to get rid of the OpenGL depency o Non-linear tweens
Fast scrolling
Dithering
Scrollable text in all directions
Image prescalling and cache
FunKey easy menu system
- Many retro gaming console emulator improvements:
Display speed optimizations
Fast bilinear display rescaling
Game backup/restore system for ""Instant Play""
CPU and floating point vector optimizations o Quick Action Keys
FunKey consistent menu system
 About the shipping:Because of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, shipping costs have increased in a major way, however, we believe these prices should be back to normal as the health situation improves. In order to minimise costs for you, our backers, we will not be charging the current higher shipping charges at the time of pledging. The FunKey S will ship from Shenzhen in China with the best possible care. To avoid any delivery problems we will declare full value of the products. Shipping and taxes will be calculated and paid for towards the end of the campaign, just before we ship out to our backers.We will be working hard to secure you the best shipping prices. Please provide a phone number for delivery, failure to do so might prevent successful delivery Remarks: - The FunKey S comes with our own pre-installed software with a number of retro gaming console emulators and some free (as in Freedom) games. We expect the number of emulators to grow in the future, as we plan to open the FunKey platform to external developers",47.0,2,"1 Campaign

I took place in different tournaments both local and online, I got sponsored and then I started recording my gameplay, editing it and sharing it on YouTube. After sharing my editing work many teams offered me to join their team as an editor. I am currently working at a gaming lounge and soon I'm starting my tattoo courses. In the near future I will be probably streaming my gameplay, editing and sharing it more. Thank you!

If we reach €300.000 instead of buying property we will rent a place and open the Gaming Lounge.. If we don't reach our funding goals we will probably relaunch this campaign 2-3 times and if we still don't reach our funding goals we are still opening the Lounge but with less sections for the meaning time and if we earn enough money we will complete the creation of the sections. Facebook page will be linked as soon as possible for the progress and updates of our campaign.Note: We will refund the money if we do not reach our funding goal.
We just want to say that any kind of help is appreciated. We are aware that not everybody can contribute financially but please spread the word for our campaign and help us succeed. Thank you!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Jim Kutsko and I have been playing fantasy football since the early 2000s.  I've learned a lot during that time and the most important thing is how important the fantasy draft is to the success of your team.  In my opinion, <b>success in fantasy football is 50% the draft, 30% managing your team during the season and 20% good old-fashioned luck</b>!  The draft was always my least favorite part of the fantasy season because it was both time consuming and frustrating to find the information I wanted to know about players in order to make determinations as to whether I should target or avoid that player come draft day.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I decided that I should create an app that allows fantasy football players to </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">easily and quickly create a fully customized draftlist that is set to their league's settings and their personal player preferences</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">!  The app has a super easy interface and requires only two steps for the user to complete.</span><br/></p>
<p>1.  Set your league point schedule for offensive players.</p>
<p>2.  Filter unwanted players from your list based on certain statistical categories</p>
<p>The app then does all the heavy lifting.  From the league point schedule it will automatically calculate each player's projected points for the upcoming season and value each player accordingly.  Then the filter turns player research on it's head.  Instead of you having to look up stats for each player on the draftlist, you tell the list what your criteria is and it will eliminate all players that do not meet that criteria!  <br/></p>

<p><b>What we need</b></p>
<p>We are looking to raise $10,000 through sale of the app.  The money raised will help to cover some of our startup costs and allow us to expand out marketing and publicity of the app. All of these things will be possible, even if we don't reach our goal, but we want to get this app to as many fantasy gamers as possible - we hope you will join us in our quest.</p>
<p>When you make a donation of $5 or more you will have access to the app for your fantasy draft.  If you do not play Fantasy Football we still encourage you to make a donation and help us to continue to develop and grow My Perfect Fantasy Draft.

<p>Zombie Escape is a free-to-play multiplayer game based off the popular Counter-Strike community-created gamemode, with an RPG twist. The core of the game involves escaping the zombie team as humans in a player-versus-player fashion. Zombie Escape is designed to be played with a large number of people - we're talking about 20-50 players altogether. This makes for a fun, social and fast-paced gameplay environment.  As a zombie, your goal is to infect the humans in order to stop them from reaching the end of the level.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467690232/jzkutlek6bjsh4pmqx8e.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>We plan on integrating a leveling system into the game while ensuring that gameplay will be balanced for newcomers and experienced players alike.</i></p>
</div><div>Unlike many other zombie games, being a zombie is actually just as fun as being a human. Like in the Counter-Strike version, once a zombie injures a human, they are automatically infected and can continue infecting everyone around them as a zombie theirself. Humans can defend themselves from zombies by shooting them which both damages and knocks them back. If a zombie takes too much damage, they will die and respawn near a teammate. We really are aiming for a simple, arcade feeling.</div><div> </div><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467682390/os3a0zpgleqansf0jrwy.png"" src="""" style=""""/></div><div> </div><div style=""text-align: center;""><i>Prototype health HUD on the left.

In addition to that, we have balanced the current weapons and have made a tested the game multiple times to ensure it looks and feels the way we expected it to at this point in our development.</div><div> </div><div>
<strong> Q: </strong>Why not play the original Zombie Escape mod?</div><div>
<strong>A:</strong> Zombie Escape offers a plethora of new weapons and items that the original mod could not support! Zombie Escape will feature regular client updates that will introduce an immense arsenal of weaponry to players. Zombie Escape will also feature an experience-based level-up system.

</div></div>","We are a group of independent developers that are looking to gain experience while creating games and working on projects that we've developed a passion for. This project truly is a dream come true as it based off one of our most beloved mods that has been around for over a decade. Among us you can find Sleggie (Project Leader) and Hoobalugalar; the lead programmer and creator of the very successful free-to-play game Codename CURE.

Zombie Escape is a free-to-play multiplayer game based off the popular Counter-Strike community-created gamemode, with an RPG twist. The core of the game involves escaping the zombie team as humans in a player-versus-player fashion. Zombie Escape is designed to be played with a large number of people - we're talking about 20-50 players altogether. This makes for a fun, social and fast-paced gameplay environment.  As a zombie, your goal is to infect the humans in order to stop them from reaching the end of the level.

We plan on integrating a leveling system into the game while ensuring that gameplay will be balanced for newcomers and experienced players alike.
Unlike many other zombie games, being a zombie is actually just as fun as being a human. Like in the Counter-Strike version, once a zombie injures a human, they are automatically infected and can continue infecting everyone around them as a zombie theirself. Humans can defend themselves from zombies by shooting them which both damages and knocks them back. If a zombie takes too much damage, they will die and respawn near a teammate. We really are aiming for a simple, arcade feeling.  Prototype health HUD on the left. This image is from Alpha 1.1, which is currently 2 patches behind. So far in our development, we have managed to create an infection system, a round system and human class system. In addition to that, we have balanced the current weapons and have made a tested the game multiple times to ensure it looks and feels the way we expected it to at this point in our development. 
 Q: Why not play the original Zombie Escape mod?
A: Zombie Escape offers a plethora of new weapons and items that the original mod could not support! Zombie Escape will feature regular client updates that will introduce an immense arsenal of weaponry to players. Zombie Escape will also feature an experience-based level-up system. The game is also free! In conclusion, the standalone version of Zombie Escape will open the gates to create a much more immersive and unique Zombie experience! At the time that this fundraiser has been published, we've been working on an official map (Highway), our HUD/GUI, more awesome music, zombie classes, more models (which are coming very soon) and are looking into developing a weapon unlocking system. Those are our current priorities. What we plan to do afterwards is improve what has been already created, improve the engine, add more weapons and take in all the feedback we've gotten to truly make this the project of our dreams.    The game will be available on Steam (if Greenlit, of course) and will be running on the Source engine. 
To some, this might be a turn off, but who cares? It's addictive! And trust me when I say this. If any of you Team Fortress 2 players remember how the game was back in 2007 and 2008, you were awarded for playing the game with a variety of uniqu item drops. That's exactly what we're planning on doing here, minus the obnoxious crate and key system similar games are using today. The only way you can get the special non-cosmetic items are by playing, which means that everyone is equal in their chances, and nobody has an advantage over anybody else. This also means that there is a point to both playing and winning! 
As of now, the inventory system is designed to be divided into six categories: primary weapon, secondary weapon, melee, grenade and ability.As for the zombies, they are able to pick through different classes. These such classes are planned to be: leaper, runner and tank, with their own rank-up system based off of a player's experience points (XP), featuring a robust customization system behind that.

 

The game will be 100% free to play. This means no microtransactions or ""premium"" content.

 
In addition to the above, the game is based around general updates. We plan to continue to support the game after release, which will include new weapons, perks, abilities, maps and so on. This keeps users motivated and keeps the game even more fresh and unique. There really isn't an end!

When we switched to Steam, we were thinking about which game to release first, and we decided to remaster this good, fun game. StrikeForce Kitty is a PC arcade platformer with RPG elements, where the player controls a team of four cats saving their kingdom from the fox army that is storming the capital of the Cat Kingdom. The game's main feature is the suits that the player receives for victories over the foxes.  The suits make the characters stronger and give them abilities that open new ways of completing the levels. Each suit is a reference to pop culture: movies, games, comics, anime, cartoons.  In addition, you can pump the cats up by training them in the gym, making them stronger, faster and more resilient.Each level is about finding the optimal path. With new abilities, you can discover new ways of completing the level and find rarer suits. Searching for these paths often becomes a puzzle of its own.You can play and get an idea of the game here: What exactly we decided to improve:1) Graphical content. We're drawing new tiles for each biome to make the graphics more saturated and detailed. 2) The number of suits. We're planning to raise it from 225, in the original game, to 350..3) New levels. We'll rework the 12 old levels, and more suits will make it possible to create additional levels for the game.4) Team bonuses. We will add bonuses for getting together thematic teams from the characters' suits, starting with simple ones: for example, teams made up of the game's characters; and ending with teams that are related by plots in their own universes.5) Improved battles. In addition to passive skills that give you bonuses or open new paths, now the suits will give you active skills for battles. This will make the battles more tactical, and will allow for increase of the importance of the suit in comparison with the outfits from elements of different suits that give higher capabilities.6) Thematic bosses. By getting a specific team together, you will open a new location on the map with a boss connected by plot or meaning to your team. After defeating the boss, you will receive a new suit that will may open up something new.7) More animation, effects and sounds for thematic suits.8) A casino and a restaurant. The casino will allow you to win suit elements or just increase your experience level for pumping up the kittens. The restaurant will allow you to adjust the combat potential of your team with meals by strengthening or compensating for one of the characteristics of the cats on your team. 9) The game will support two languages: Russian and English. The general concept of the game will be elaborated and smoothed out. Most of the content is ready. We plan to complete development this fall.Right now the game needs your votes to pass Greenlight!  We are an independent studio consisting of three guys who work remotely from each other.

</div></div>","Hello there! We are Studio Spektar, indie game developer from Croatia bent on world domination! Since world domination is pretty expensive we rather decided to make a game about the same topic. Also, we figured it would be fun to do it as a boar named Viktor in a game that beares the same title.


Viktor is a classic point and click adventure game set in a fictional world where not only do animals talk, but history has also taken a weird turn. As if the talking animals wasn't enough? The story focuses on our protagonist, or should we say antagonist, Viktor. We want to deliver a high quality funny game inspired by the great classics like Monkey Island.
But don’t take our word for it. Why not check out the game yourself? 


Didn't feel like playing the game? Why not check out the intro to Viktor. Just so you can get a taste of this really bizarre world we are creating.
Looks fun, huh? We loved creating it!







Check out the smoke on that one!
Our artist, Sven, created all these beautiful drawings from his great artistic mind. We usually gave him some time to think it trough then pressure him like crazy to get them done to a certain deadline although there was no actual deadline. Artists are an interesting bunch.



Well this is a map I could hang in my living room next to the tiger rug and the fire place.
We at Studio Spektar believe in equality. Because of that, we believe that everybody should be offended equally. No matter if you are from Mei-Din, Ban-An-As or Austria-Hungary (like we are!).



Hey! Who put a picture of my bathtub here?!

Even though point and click adventure games are slow, there is no reason why your pointing and clicking shouldn't be fast at times. Test your reactions in some of our fun (and at times frustrating) mini games!

Hour and hours of recorded high quality dialogue

1. Dramatic monologue
2. Emotional monologue
3. Shakespearean  sonataCan you hear the pure pronunciation of each work? The crisp sound made 
in a professional studio? You can listen to those sounds for hours! Yes, we know. We are speechless as well.




Like anyone with a project, we need FUNDING! Our goal is to get at least 10.000$ in order to focus our efforts on finishing Viktor within a year. Every dollar will go into development of the game which includes: paying rent, buying food and generally surviving until we finish the game.
 After that, WE TAKE OVER THE WORLD! *cough cough* I mean, we go and create new games for you to enjoy!

<p>As a player, maybe you have experienced
these things again and again in a great deal of games:</p>
<p>·It’s midnight, you playing late, and getting sleepy, really wants to
go to bed, but still decide to grow one more level;</p>
<p>·You already know playing this game have no fun, even feeling so sick
when playing, but you still decide to buy and play it, only because you can get
more trophies or achievements;</p>
<p>·Just
clicking one button, repeat one action for several hours, just because you
think the next monster will drop a better weapon or armor for you, or you just
need some materials but the drop rate is a lottery;</p>
<p>·You
really hate some points of a game, tell the developers, and they just reply such as “love it, then stay;
otherwise, get away”, you feel angry but still stay;</p>
<p>·After
beating a game for days or weeks, then look back and thought, “why the HELL
was I ruining my hundred hours of life on that?!”</p>
<p>If you have experienced one or some of these, then you have to
know:</p>
<p>YOU ARE NOT PLAYING THE GAME. YOU, AND WE, ARE ACTUALLY BEING
PLAYED BY THE GAME.</p>
<p>WHY WE PLAY GAMES <b>AT FIRST</b>?
AND WHY WE PLAY GAMES FOR NOW? </p>
<p>DIDN’T WE PLAY GAMES FOR <b>FUN</b>? <br/></p>
<p><b>WE SHOULD PUT AN END TO THIS!</b><br/></p>
<p>THAT’S WHY I STARTED TO CREATE THIS GAME, <b>A GAME OF THE PLAYERS</b>, AND WE PLAY IT – <b>FOR FUN</b>.</p>

<p>UNLIMITED EXPLORE is a game including <b>sandbox</b> environment creation, totally-free
exploration and completely modifiable contents with the <b>ARPG combat and
leveling system.</b> There are some differences between Unlimited Explore and other
games, but it’s not hard to understand.</p>
<p><b>FIRST, WE CREATE.</b> Do you have a place you want to go? Do you
have a world in your heart build by your great imagination?
Or you just want to bring your house into the game? Build what you want in
<b>CREATION MODE</b>. Just pick some components in the game, put them to the right
places, and you will create Mountains, forests, castles, dungeons, or something
else. If this game can get more support, and we can dive underwater, fly high
in the sky, even space environments (and environments with no gravity) will be available.
After that, place some <b>monsters, bosses, and items, NPCs, Quests</b> (if got enough funds to build the quest function), then everything’s done.</p>

<p><b>SECOND, WE VOTE.</b> Vote is the biggest feature of this game. So
why do we need to vote in this game? It’s simple, we vote for the <b>best maps of
the week</b>, and those maps will be the next update – <b>be the official maps</b>. In
other words – let all the players know, and play what you create. </p>
<p>You may ask, “How can I vote before I play someone’s map?” Good
question. </p>
<p>We can download and play others’ maps in <b>FREE EXPLORATION MODE</b>.
After you play the map, you can vote to decide this map is a good map or not.
IF your maps get the best ratings, then congratulations – if not, don’t feel
sad, anyone can still download and play your maps in free exploration mode. You
can also try to update them, make them better and get another chance UNTIL
success. <br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><b>THIRD, WE PLAY</b>. Those best maps of the week will be the contents
in the next update, be the official maps – in EXPLORATION MODE. <b>There’s only

<p><b>GAME OF THE PLAYERS:</b>
Most of the games we buy only give us the right to use (play). But UNLIMITED
EXPLORE is different: this game will give you the <b>OWNERSHIP</b> of the game, to
create and change everything. There’s more – UNLIMITED EXPLORE is an <b>OPEN

<br/>
<p><b>GAME BY THE PLAYERS:</b> UNLIMITED
EXPLORE is a game by the players, because we create contents for ourselves, and
you can always create what you want to play. We can beat games that only create

<b>This game is endless – with players, there will be maps to explore. With

<p><br/></p>
<p><b>GAME FOR THE PLAYERS:</b>
With more and more maps and contents in our game, the gameplay of these
contents will be different. <b>You want to be a superman who can slay ten monsters

As a player, maybe you have experienced
these things again and again in a great deal of games:
·It’s midnight, you playing late, and getting sleepy, really wants to
go to bed, but still decide to grow one more level;
·You already know playing this game have no fun, even feeling so sick

more trophies or achievements;
·Just
clicking one button, repeat one action for several hours, just because you
think the next monster will drop a better weapon or armor for you, or you just
need some materials but the drop rate is a lottery;
·You
really hate some points of a game, tell the developers, and they just reply such as “love it, then stay;
otherwise, get away”, you feel angry but still stay;
·After
beating a game for days or weeks, then look back and thought, “why the HELL
was I ruining my hundred hours of life on that?!”
If you have experienced one or some of these, then you have to
know:
YOU ARE NOT PLAYING THE GAME. YOU, AND WE, ARE ACTUALLY BEING
PLAYED BY THE GAME.
WHY WE PLAY GAMES AT FIRST?
AND WHY WE PLAY GAMES FOR NOW? 
DIDN’T WE PLAY GAMES FOR FUN? 
WE SHOULD PUT AN END TO THIS!
THAT’S WHY I STARTED TO CREATE THIS GAME, A GAME OF THE PLAYERS, AND WE PLAY IT – FOR FUN.

trading card game that focuses on the struggle between predator and
prey. As a dastardly meddler, you play around with the fate of a
chosen few, satiating the hunger of your predators while protecting
your prey from others like you. Life is just a game, so you may as
well instigate a little conflict... Who cares if a few people get a
little slobber on them, so long as you have fun!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In
this game, you’ll be fitting your monsters and morsels with the
means to take out your opponents’. Score 10 points before anyone
else and you win. You score points when one of your predators devours
someone, and you can use cards like actions and events to help them
do so. But
be careful--when a predator becomes full, it naturally has to gurgle
its food away. Like a quick hibernation, this leaves it vulnerable to
the antics of your foes. If you let your predators go too crazy, they
might find themselves out of the action before you know it!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to play dirty. In fact, it’s encouraged!</p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">My pen name for this project is Shadecerule, who is also my flavorful fursona. I've kept my real identity a secret due to the mature nature of this game (you know, because of employers, crazy people from the Internet, and all that jazz), but here is a little bit about me. I'm a game designer who recently graduated from the Art Institute of Vancouver near the top of my class. During my time there, I underwent rigorous training in game design, programming, and playtesting. Other than Gurgle, I am working on a few nifty little Android games, but I hope to make more vore games in the future!<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Gurgle began as a simple idea that I spurred up for fun. Once I realized my idea had potential, I decided to take the game to the next level and get serious. I've been working on it for the past three years and it's become a labor of love. Now, I want to release something that everyone in the vore fandom can enjoy. This game has taken a lot of hard work to get to this stage and I'm finally at the last stretch. That's why I've started this campaign: to bring it to you guys!</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Where is Gurgle With Playtesting?</span></h3>
<div>Gurgle has gone through loads of playtesting to get it to where it is now, but it still needs more. I'm presently putting together a digital platform to make for some quick and easy playtesting. I'll be using a program called LackeyCCG which allows me to create my own plugin with only a small amount of programming. If anyone would like to join me in some playtests once this gets up and running, feel free to shoot me an email! (Importantly, I must point out that this will not be a prototype for the digital version of the game! LackeyCCG will only be for playtesting. The digital version of Gurgle will be created more professionally with Unity 5.)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Where is Gurgle With the Digital Version?</h3>
<div>At present, the digital version is still undergoing its technical design phase. I've been writing an entire document to flesh out the technical needs and functions the game requires; for instance, menu flowcharts and animation timings. It's approximately 80% complete but I need to do a little more playtesting before I can finalize the document. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">What Does Gurgle Need, and Why Fund It?</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Gurgle is primarily a game that panders to those who are into vore. This is a big project and a very expensive endeavore (ahem), and so I need a lot of help from you: the community. I’ve designed about 300 cards for the first set and I have a few smaller sets planned out for the future. While this campaign is just to help me get the first set off the ground, 300 cards is still an expensive venture in terms of art. My goal is to commission many great artists from the community, but this will only be possible with your support. (If you'd like to see the artists I am interested in, here is a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PduzmYv6cYWAPVmePaxdgwpnDpNvWE196z-fB9UWj9o/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">lovely little list</a> for you to look at. Feel free to make suggestions for artists you'd like to see in the game!)</p>
<p>I’m asking for $15,000 so that I can afford to pay these lovely people for all that art. I project that $13,000 will go toward paying artists, and the rest will go toward backer perks, the Indiegogo fee and taxes, and a portion of the first batch of cards. The rest of the money I need to complete this project will come out of my own pocket. </p>
<p>For those of you interested, here's a tasty pie chart that shows approximately where your support will go.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<h3>How Will Artists Be Paid?</h3>
<p>Properly compensating artists is very important to me. I've heard so many stories about people not getting paid or getting taken advantage of, and I don't want this project to be one of those stories. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Artists will be paid upfront before they even begin working. I intend on paying people their standard commission price for the assigned work, as well as a 15-20% licensing fee. I'm also offering the option to redeem perks that equal your commission price, and a combination of perks and payment. I'm always open to discussion!</span></p>
<p>One more note in response to a few popular questions: art will be licensed to me for use in my game, but the artist will still retain partial ownership of their created work. The owners of any characters involved in the art will also retain all ownership rights to their characters.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>

<p><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Gurgle will initially be released as a physical card game and then as a digital game. This is because once the game has been fully made, it is quite easy to release it as a physical product. The digital version of the game requires coding, more art assets, engine and server expenses, and a lot more time. I would also like to hire a team of talented folks to help me out so that it can be made as professionally as possible! That is why the digital version has been scheduled for release at a later date.</span></p>
<p><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">I will be publishing and distributing this game myself. I plan on ordering my cards and supplies through The Game Crafters, though I am also considering DriveThruCards. Other suggestions are also welcome! A few factors still need to be ironed out before concrete decisions can be made. At the present moment, the approximate expense of my first batch of cards (including materials like dice and rulebooks, as well as the physical backer perks) amounts to approximately $950. </span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Perky Perks</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Naturally, every good campaign has some snacks for its backers!</p>
<p>All perks stack, meaning that when you make a contribution, you will receive that perk and all the earlier perks. Also note that some perks have a limited availability. When they are no longer available, they will be removed from the list and can no longer be claimed. Make sure to get them before they're gone!</p>
<p>For those of you who select cameo and character slot perks, be warned: This game cannot accept characters that breach any copyright. If a character is under copyright, I must have permission from the owner of the intellectual property.</p>
<p>Additionally, those who are interested in cameo slots can look at <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uNYLo_KursnIFttKZisaPkSIV-HUnkI5cPO5y8fwyJk/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this list</a> to see what is available!</p>

<div>A campaign needs to have some goals to stretch out those guts, right? Well, here they are!</div>
<p>$16,000 - All backers who contributed at least $25 will have a ticket entered in a raffle. Backers will have 1 additional ticket entered for every $10 contributed beyond $25, for a maximum of 10 tickets. First prize will have their perk tier upgraded to the $450 perk. If the winner has already reached the $450 perk tier, then they get all of those perks over again! Second prize will be awarded with a cameo slot in one of the cards. Third prize will receive one of each starter deck and three booster packs. The winners will be selected when the campaign ends and the prizes will ship with the rest of the perks.</p>
<p>$20,000 - When Gurgle enters its digital phase of production, a team of talented individuals will be hired to work on it. Production time is estimated to be 8-12 months and will begin 3-5 months after the end of this campaign. This game will be available on Windows, Linux, and Mac, and it will support 2-4 player matches over the Internet. It will be made in Unity 5 and it will be free to download and play! (While the digital version will be made with or without this goal, this goal will allow it to be made more quickly and more professionally.)</p>

<h3>What Sets Are in Store For The Future</h3>
<p>The first set I plan to release will be fairly vanilla to appeal to the broadest audience; only oral vore with minimal nudity. The set will cover many themes that come with the territory of vore while keeping it fairly clean (in the dirtiest of ways, of course). This campaign is only to get the first set off the ground, but I have plans to release many more sets to explore all facets of vore. Here's a little taste of what I have in store...</p>
<p><b>Just For the Playas : </b>Soon after the first set is released, I'd like to begin working on this very special set. It will be composed of character cards that display the characters of the community: you guys!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Such Great Heights :</b> The theme of this set will revolve around macros and micros. Get ready to romp, stomp, and chomp around town!</p>
<p><b>Unusual Feeding :</b> While the other sets will have alternative vore in them, this set will focus exclusively on these alternative forms of vore: CV, AV, vampirism, tail vore, belly vore, breast vore, and so on. You'll see a whole variety of kinkier themes as well, like goo beasts and glorious tentacle porn!</p>
<p><b>Hold Onto Your Humanity! : </b>While the first set of Gurgle will have a handful of human and demi-human characters, the majority of the cast will be furry. That is why this is a set that is only for humans!</p>
<p><b>Hark, a Piano! :</b> Toony characters, vore jokes, and all sorts of silliness accompany this set. Watch out, 'cause it's raining pianos!</p>

</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Besides getting eaten along the way, the most difficult part of finishing this game will be getting all of the art assets.

<p>I would also like to note that even if this campaign does not reach its goal, Gurgle will remain in production until finished. This will require more time for me to amass my own personal funds for art, and so the release of Gurgle will merely be postponed until then.</p>

Motion Capture is a feature designed by Notim and the name of this technique, the Preception Neuron, which can move the characters in a natural, professional and similar way to reality.-Facial capture: Very easy and smooth way by taking the camera on the face, so that the camera Interact with the face of the personality, and we need two cameras to be installed with the Motion Capture so that each shot with it a moving face. -Concept Art: Graphics or design backgrounds of the game, we need professional painters to draw the game's backgrounds, including the environment, characters, etc.-Programming Advanced: We require the expertise of foreign programmers who are specialized in software that is difficult to program and take longer time in programming.-Compose.-3D Modeling.- The game has gone through stages of development and we are still working hard and diligent day and night to provide the public with a better game. - The game will release on Steam green light, and we need your support for the project to succeed and be accepted.- This project requires an amount of 11.200 dollars, or about 42,000 riyals.The amount is too large, why?We know that the amount is very huge for the project, but as you know this project has cost us about 11,273 SR so far to buy the models and software we need for the project, so we have used foreigners and pay for the work of Programmer we ask them, and also buy 3rd party tools specialized in modeling and moving and design of the project, recently we thought that we are putting funding to provide those technologies, and we hope everyone help us achieve this project.What about other platforms?First, our focus is on the development of the game, and after it is finished it will be released on PC running Windows, while the other platform like PlayStation-xbox-mac there will be versions for them released in the future.Does the game support Arabic?Epic Company has taken care of the Arabic language. We previously contacted them and asked them to support the Arabic language. They responded to our request. Arabic is now supported in the engine, but it needs more improvements, and the company still carries out this task among its tasks.Where are the events of the story?The story takes place in a village called Lena, a village north of Najd, one of the oldest settlements in the Arabian island.I will support the project with a financial amount, but what's in it for me?In the same page on the right, you will find Perks, each containing offers. All you have to do is to choose which one suit you best, and after we release of the game, you will get those offers.Can I refund?When you choose one of the available packages and you pay for it, this means you agree to this and you cannot recover the money.When will the game be released?Preliminary version: It is expected to be released this year or early next year.Full version: Not specified yet until the requested amount of money is completed.Does it support the control hand (Joystick)?Yes, it will support the control hand on computers with Windows. We wish everyone to visit the indiegogo and read all the details. If you want to contribute to the project, we will be happy to do so by visiting the page and choosing the amount of money you would like to pay.If you are not able to support, there is another way to support the project by posting this page to your friends via the social networking buttons available on this page, such as Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, WhatsApp, please also publish it to achieve this project, God willing.",31.0,0,"2 Campaigns

You will be doing things like trading parts, working on cars with friends in a garage, winning a fat bet at the drag strip, losing your car and screaming in anger, going to factories to make custom parts, dealing with the legal system and player cops, risking value anytime you speed in a car, building something cheap to trash it, and trying to win the glorious Gumball Race Trophy. The game is mostly <strong>free-to-play</strong> with a subscription tier. There will not be annoying micro transactions.</p><h2>Why Are We Making This?</h2><p>I was a big street racer growing up. I've been in cuffs a few times going too hard in cars. I'm 31 now and realize that's stupid behavior, but still struggle to say no to any stranger on the road who wants to mess around. Between growing up on dirt-bikes, racing cars, and a tour to Afghanistan in the infantry, I got hooked on adrenaline. It has slowly morphed into anxiety and feeling stuck. I NEED a safe outlet to get the rush, and my passions are cars and computers. I've been a full-stack developer for almost a decade now, and I started combining my passions into making World of Pursuits.</p><h2>The Map</h2><p>We have tons of assets, we just need to play legos with them to build out the whole 16 square kilometer map. It is a multiple island map connected with bridges. There is a big center island formed by a volcano that a highway goes around to the different themed areas. We want the driving and street racing aspects to be as close to realism as possible, but we plan to have some embellished scenes, architecture, and roads. Everyone thinks underwater tunnels are cool ;)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585685235/psrwixrkknexqqhy5dwo.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585685259/ify23zyefzdb3sqgpfb0.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585685287/npo4jddefohwdjk5vkjo.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585685318/vn270f6irtcyljdhkres.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585685338/brbmxuw3dbjnu7wfkb9n.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585685358/oywkcekezfydbfv14uez.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585685390/suvl9enlgufcfc6xw5dz.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585685405/srkd9x9tvak8utdc80fq.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585685659/rhsy6gsivop32wrhrst5.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585685676/mhrpvna1nkrruge2q8za.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585685698/gs3pfmwd07kzsw2pqpxo.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585685719/ghuayiji1z9tf5vp4plq.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585685910/pzrp1emdpvg9gzohgcxv.png"" src=""""/></p><h2>​How Is This Game Different Than Other Racing Games?</h2><p><strong>Adrenaline</strong></p><p>World of Pursuits is not going after profit, nor is it going after fame, It's solely going for the adrenaline rush. This isn't a casual game, like Need For Speed, that EA makes for the mass population. This is for the real racers out there. Current street racing games are boring and miss the concept of street racing. They don't have any real risk in them. I have looked over and over for a high risk racing game. You need risk present for adrenaline to be present. In current games, if you crash or lose, who cares? God forbid you have to re-spawn or have to re-try a race. That is zero adrenaline, zero risk, and zero appeal to real racers or thrill seekers. World of Pursuits is the opposite.</p><p><strong>Risk Factor</strong></p><p>In World of Pursuits, players have to spend their own time building vehicles. All vehicles are custom built by players, and all vehicles can be lost. A super car will require one week of waiting on factory jobs to complete, and then some time assembling all the parts together. Cheaper cars can be built in under an hour. This has a MAJOR impact on risk during races. If you get pushed off of a cliff in a super car, there goes one week of waiting. It was your own fault for letting your opponent catch you in your glass rocket. You can buy another one from a player if they're willing to sell, or you'll have to build your own again. This game will be a brutal emotional roller-coaster. The durability of vehicles will be based on the vehicles build. Do you want to be a glass rocket? Or do you think the turtle wins the race? The more you win, the more sponsors you get (extra income per race). The more you lose, the sponsors will leave.</p><h2>Player VS Player (PVP)</h2><p>There is only PVP racing in World of Pursuits. Players can also donate their vehicles to become volunteer police officers and start PVP police chases. In a PVP police chase, both the cop and the suspect are risking value. World of Pursuits has a global speed limit. A player cop can start a chase if they get a radar gun lock on a speeding player, or if they run a plate that's wanted. Only vehicles without bounties can be police, but you'll need a car with a bounty to enter the Gumball Race.</p><h2>The Gumball Race</h2><p>You will have to risk A LOT to win the Gumball Race. This is the ""raid"" race that most players will never win. We're not sure how many players can be on a server at once yet, but we want as many players as possible for this 30 minute race all over the island. Bring/risk your own car with no restrictions. There are no rules, and most players won't finish. If you think you're good at racing games, prove it in World of Pursuits.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585684807/f7p8bsxi26zxhnmb3kxr.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>Subscription Tier</h2><p>We are trying to make the most we can free-to-play, but someone has to pay the bills. Players will need to go to the DMV in game in order to get a driver's license renewal form, which costs real life money. The player can then use the driver's license renewal form in game to apply subscription time to their account. Players can also trade driver's license renewal forms in game to other players. Once the player has a valid license, they can buy car insurance and rent property, such as garages or homes. </p><h2>When Will The Project Be Live?</h2><p>Our development build should be released soon. It is full of bugs and the inventory resets nightly. This build is for testing and for our backers to checkup on the project. We want to get it live ASAP in order to let our players help guide the game's direction. Cars and computers have been a passion of mine forever, and I plan to continue developing World of Pursuits as a hobby for life. </p><h2>Where Your Money Goes</h2><p>So far we've been balling on a budget. I worked on this project alone for a year, and then hired a few contractors to help throughout 2019.<b> The game will be finished with or without extra funding</b>, but your funding will allow much faster development. I can only afford a few part-time developers right now. I have put a lot of time and money into this game, but there is still a while to go. All the funds are being CAREFULLY used to get to the end product. I will still be funding this project myself at the same time. The funds from our backers will go to hiring more developers and buying more game content to speed up development. I am very proud thus far of the work my team has done for the current cost. I am so proud, that they now have equity in the project. Now, we all just want to see it go live.</p><h2>Current Road Map</h2><p><strong>10K | Industrial Island</strong> - The industrial island will be where a lot of factories are located for players to make parts.</p><p><strong>20K | Hospital </strong> - The hospital is the re-spawn point if you are killed, </p><p><strong>30K | Impound Lot</strong> - The impound lot is where policed seized vehicles and abandoned vehicles that got towed can be recovered for a small fee.</p><p><strong>40K | Farms </strong>- Players will need to haul raw resources from farms to factories in order to turn it into parts. Our crafting system is trying to stick to realism for schematics, weight, and size of raw resources and parts.For example, making things like rubber requires a player to go to a rubber tree farm to get latex. The farmland will also include a train to help haul resources and it doubles as public transportation.</p><p><strong>50K | Prison and Military Islands</strong> - The prison and military bases will be on two separate smaller islands off of the main island. </p><p><strong>60K | Tourism Island</strong> - This little island will include the nicest drag strip and have a Vegas style theme.</p><p><strong>70k | Suburbs</strong> - This island will be in between the tourism island and the main island. Houses will be available to lease if you want more garage space, to have a fast travel point, or you just want to show off. </p><p><strong>80K | Downtown</strong> - Downtown will be a city scene full of lights at night. The city will host the main police station, so there will naturally be a lot of player cops trolling around in the city.</p><p><strong>90K | Main Race Track</strong> - This track will be located around the farmland. Players can race legally at race tracks. You will have to pay for track insurances and fees to get on the track, but your car can't be lost.</p><p><strong>100K | Other Race Tracks</strong> - We want oval tracks, windy tracks, dirt tracks, auto-cross tracks, everything. After the main track, we should be able to quickly create others by reusing logic.</p><p><strong>110K | Character Creator</strong> - We have a rough character creator already, but we need to build out the framework to get it looking pretty and fun to play with. </p><p><strong>120K | Player Market</strong> - We plan to make an in game computer that players can deploy in their houses or garages in order to access the player market to trade parts. We want to make a full blown exchange where players can place buy and sell orders. If we have money left over, we might even add options trading.</p><p><strong>130K | Shipping Contracts</strong> - Players will be able to create shipping contracts with other players to haul things around the map. Shipping contracts will require collateral in case the goods are destroyed during transport, or the contract time expires</p><p><strong>140K | Towing </strong>- Abandoned player cars can be towed to the impound lot for a reward. </p><p><strong>150K |Crews, Friends, and Grouping </strong>- Players will be able to join crews. Players can add ea other to their friends list, and players will have the ability to queue for activities together in groups.</p><p><strong>160K | Leasing Property </strong>- Subscription players can lease locations to gain more garage space as well as a fast travel point. The leases will be monthly and auto deducted from your in game money. </p><p><strong>190K | Pursuit Logic</strong> - We currently have very rough pursuit logic. We still need to find time to figure it out. PVP police chases like this haven't been done before, as far as we know. So we may need to tune and tweak it to get it right. We are trying to stick to realism. Police will have to catch a speeder or run a wanted plate. Police are risking their own car to chase. The suspect has the option to stop and take the ticket if they're not highly wanted. Highly wanted players won't have the option to take a ticket. They will be arrested, lose their bounty, and their car will either be impounded or crushed.</p><p><b>230K | AI </b>- AI logic is a pain. It is real-time logic that has to be done right. Traffic AI has been done tons of times already, but we want to get it right. Milliseconds count when going 200mph. To get this game feeling smooth, it is going to take some magic. We'll probably start small with very light traffic to get the world feeling alive.</p><p><strong>250K | Multiplayer Garages </strong>- Players will be able to add friends to a garage and also assign them roles. We're going to break actions down like moving items, taking items, deploying items, etc... into roles you can set for your guest and crew members. If you trust the person, you can give them full rights to your stuff. This requires a lot of mapping of single roles, group roles, crew roles, etc.. and a lot of testing to make sure it's safe and the networking logic is secure.</p><p><b>250K+ | 0 Tolerance Bug Fixing &amp; More Maps</b>- At this point the game is in alpha state. We have all the required and planned features, but the game will probably still have cosmetic bugs and occasional lag hiccups. Any extra funds will go to getting the game very smooth. After the game is smooth to play, we will create more maps out of any remaining funds.</p><p> </p><h2>Ways You Can Help</h2><ul>

<p>Demi is an Online Trading Card Game as well as a Collectible Card Game based off Mythologies/Pantheons. Greek, Norse, and Egyptian which are the first three main Mythologies, with the eligibility to expand. We're hoping to release one major Mythology a year. These will be our version of Expansions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I grew up playing the original Yugioh, Duel Masters, and other games of that nature. Because of that, I've striven to find modern games that were decently simplistic, with the core features of those games. It seems with every expansion games change drastically. A card game now isn't anywhere close to the one it was back in the day. My goal with Demi is to have the same core game-play mechanics now that it does in 10 years. A lot of people think you have to change game-play with every expansion, but with Demi each new expansion will only bring new Mythologies/Pantheons into play. Minor mechanics might be added to each new Mythology, however they will be unique to that mythology and won't effect any other past cards. This means that the cards you have today, will be just as powerful as the cards coming out on our eighth expansion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The object in Demi is to gain 20,000,000 (20 million) followers per game. These are simplified down to 20 in matches. Every follower you gain playing the game, the gods gain, which adds to their power for the war to come.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It may seem confusing at first, but as you play the game they become easier to understand, and our system adds it all up automagically to make things easier.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580269759/yz1uk7tydxocjzn9g1aq.png"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">DIGITAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>Demi will be originally developed for the PC as well as Mobile. It will be completely cross platformed, and you'll also be able to pre-register by joining the forums. This will ensure you're name is not take once the game is released.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You will be able to have a minimum of 30 cards in a deck, and a maximum of 60. This will allow for a more unique deck building experience, and unique gameplay. Will you increase your odds and build a strong 30 deck, or have a long, drawn out game using a more defensive tactic with a 60 card deck. The choice, and strategy is up to you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Card Packs:</strong></p>
<p>Card packs will consist of 5 cards. Each card will be randomly chosen. Unlike most card games where you have different packs and the higher packs have a higher chance to get legendary cards, to prevent a more pay to win feel we simply have it like this:</p>
<p>If a Legendary card has %0.1 chance of getting drawn. For every card pack you will technically have %0.5 chance of drawing that. Seeing as each card will be randomly generated. </p>
<p>At this time we're unsure if the card packs will have all mythologies, or have specific card packs for each mythology. This will be determined as the game progresses.</p>
<p><strong>Micro-transactions:</strong></p>
<p> We strive to have a p2w free game. No if's, and's, or but's about that. Our shop will consist of Card Packs (that you can purchase with f2p currency that you get easily per game). We're estimating around 10 game victories on average for a card pack. The rest are purely cosmetics. Animated Cards (three tiers, animated, golden animated, and Foil Animated) Avatars (OR avatar items. This is TBD) </p>
<p>We will also have an Auction House. This will give you the ability to sell your rare cards for paid currency. This allowing you to buy anything and everything in the shop completely free of charge. So, those who wish to play purely for free are able too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Game-play:</strong></p>
<p>Off the bat we will have a ranked gamemode, and an unranked gamemode. There will possibly be an NPC you're able to play to learn the game before delving into the game. However, we won't have a story mode until later in the game. (Potentially a separate gamemode for offline play. TBD)</p>
<p>We will also have a yearly, official tournament most likely called DCGL (Demi Card Game League) in which the top ranked players, as well as anyone else who joins will be able to play for prize money. The prize money will consist of a minimum of 10% of the funds raised by demi throughout the year. This includes sponsors for the tournament, money I personally put in, etc.</p>

<p>We're actively updating, and adding to the lore. The goal is to create an enriched environment that you can dive into. If we become large enough, the goal is to create an animated series of the game. As such, we're writing lore, and events as a full fledged Anime/Video Game. </p>

<p>The following is the basis of what we have:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Lore of Demi -</strong><br/> </p>
<p>No one knows when the gods of the Grand Pantheons first revealed themselves to man, but it must have happened in the time before history or the time even before that, when across the world the gods showed themselves to Man and taught him how to be something more than a mere animal. What is known from the arachnological record, however, is that it was the Egyptian Pantheon that first established a great stronghold on earth in the land of Kemet. For a thousand years the gods of Kemet and the sun-drenched men who served them grew in power to become the most sophisticated civilization in the arts of Science and of Building and of War. Perhaps it seemed then to both gods and pharaohs that they were destined to rule above and below for all eternity. But unbeknownst to them, the gods of the Greek Pantheon were full of cleverness and guile, they were beginning to teach their secret arts in the dark sanctuaries and sacred groves of Hellas. And so, in time the power of Hellas grew at length to rival the power of Kemet and again war erupted among the Grand Pantheons and among the nations of the earth. The priests and magi of the Egyptians called forth ghouls and monsters from the netherworld while the oracles and sages of Hellas summoned wondrous beasts and the sons of gods to wage battle on the land of Kemet, As they forged the age in terror and glory, both sides strove for supremacy, yet the fortune of gods and men was far more subtle than any could then see. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579338258/ddjci4kodxl9csglnt1k.png"" src=""""/><br/>               From the far cold fortresses of the frozen lands to which they had been exiled since the first celestial ages, the gods of the Norse Pantheon watched as the Greeks gained the upper hand over the Egyptians and drove their gods from the temples and high places of Kemet. The Norse saw too the wearying toll that the struggle had taken on Zeus, his family and the whole of Hellas. The power of Zeus, though formidably great, could not hold out forever, and the Norse gods were accustomed to the bitter torment of waiting through the endless winter; they were bitter but abiding in their patience for the proper moment to begin their machinations among men. </p>
<p><br/>               It seemed harmless at first, and so the gods of the Greek Pantheon had paid no heed. For what trouble could a few simple runes cause? They looked to be hardly more than wild chicken scratches in comparison to the penetrating light of Apollo or the unfathomable wisdom of Athena. And yet, through these runes, Odin began to impart the Great Wisdom, which he had acquired with enormous sacrifice, to the Men of the North, who grew stronger with each day. Just as the Greeks had been weakened by their victory, the Northmen had been strengthened by their hardship, and before long they had taken their swords and axes and spilled blood from the savage lands of the Far West and all the way to the eastern Kingdom of Rus so that they might do honor to their gods. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579338264/dpygfxjb66ofxeina3nq.png"" src=""""/><br/>               But even the blood-rich power of the Norse gods was doomed to fade at the close of of that age, for this is the nature of the world. Little is known what happened when the gods withdraw from the earth in the twilight between the ages. Perhaps they rest and dream. Perhaps they seethe and plot. Whatever their wont, not one god among Grand Pantheons could have foreseen what awaited them at the outset of the strange age that was to come. They returned to find themselves in a world in which children were taught to view the gods as myths, as historical curiosities, as mere trivia. There were only a scattered handful of men who still held them in honor, yet even these few had lost the old ways and proper worship. Not one of the sacred rites had survived intact and without the rites, neither gods nor men could properly wield their power. Every passing day left the Pantheons further from the energy that sustained their being on this plane. It seemed that this age was to be the last for all the elder gods who had once lifted man from the utter darkness in which he had dwelt in the most ancient days. </p>
<p><br/>               When they realized this, each Pantheon imbued a set of cards with the divine power that remained from the memory of their sacred rites. These artifacts had the power to summon all manner of beasts and monsters, even the gods themselves depending on their inscriptions. Then each Pantheon selected from its number an emissary to bestow these cards upon its faithful worshipers and to teach the hallowed secrets of their use. As these arcane cards spread across the earth, so would the power of the gods grow in proportion.   <br/>               What you have before you is just such a set of cards. Devotion and skill are needed to deploy them to the greatest advantage for your gods. The Greek, the Norse, the Egyptian gods, all have known the honeyed taste of victory and all have tasted the bitter nettle of defeat. Now you must do all that you can for your gods. You must use every kind of cunning and ruse. You must give everything of yourself so that once more your gods may have divine rule over the age! </p>

Gameplay Footage (Physical Copy): 

Demi is an Online Trading Card Game as well as a Collectible Card Game based off Mythologies/Pantheons. Greek, Norse, and Egyptian which are the first three main Mythologies, with the eligibility to expand. We're hoping to release one major Mythology a year. These will be our version of Expansions.
 
I grew up playing the original Yugioh, Duel Masters, and other games of that nature. Because of that, I've striven to find modern games that were decently simplistic, with the core features of those games. It seems with every expansion games change drastically. A card game now isn't anywhere close to the one it was back in the day. My goal with Demi is to have the same core game-play mechanics now that it does in 10 years. A lot of people think you have to change game-play with every expansion, but with Demi each new expansion will only bring new Mythologies/Pantheons into play. Minor mechanics might be added to each new Mythology, however they will be unique to that mythology and won't effect any other past cards. This means that the cards you have today, will be just as powerful as the cards coming out on our eighth expansion.
 
The object in Demi is to gain 20,000,000 (20 million) followers per game. These are simplified down to 20 in matches. Every follower you gain playing the game, the gods gain, which adds to their power for the war to come.
 
It may seem confusing at first, but as you play the game they become easier to understand, and our system adds it all up automagically to make things easier.
 
 
DIGITAL INFORMATION
Demi will be originally developed for the PC as well as Mobile. It will be completely cross platformed, and you'll also be able to pre-register by joining the forums. This will ensure you're name is not take once the game is released.
 
You will be able to have a minimum of 30 cards in a deck, and a maximum of 60. This will allow for a more unique deck building experience, and unique gameplay. Will you increase your odds and build a strong 30 deck, or have a long, drawn out game using a more defensive tactic with a 60 card deck. The choice, and strategy is up to you!
 
Card Packs:
Card packs will consist of 5 cards. Each card will be randomly chosen. Unlike most card games where you have different packs and the higher packs have a higher chance to get legendary cards, to prevent a more pay to win feel we simply have it like this:
If a Legendary card has %0.1 chance of getting drawn. For every card pack you will technically have %0.5 chance of drawing that. Seeing as each card will be randomly generated. 
At this time we're unsure if the card packs will have all mythologies, or have specific card packs for each mythology. This will be determined as the game progresses.
Micro-transactions:
 We strive to have a p2w free game. No if's, and's, or but's about that. Our shop will consist of Card Packs (that you can purchase with f2p currency that you get easily per game). We're estimating around 10 game victories on average for a card pack. The rest are purely cosmetics. Animated Cards (three tiers, animated, golden animated, and Foil Animated) Avatars (OR avatar items. This is TBD) 
We will also have an Auction House. This will give you the ability to sell your rare cards for paid currency. This allowing you to buy anything and everything in the shop completely free of charge. So, those who wish to play purely for free are able too.
 
Game-play:
Off the bat we will have a ranked gamemode, and an unranked gamemode. There will possibly be an NPC you're able to play to learn the game before delving into the game. However, we won't have a story mode until later in the game. (Potentially a separate gamemode for offline play. TBD)
We will also have a yearly, official tournament most likely called DCGL (Demi Card Game League) in which the top ranked players, as well as anyone else who joins will be able to play for prize money. The prize money will consist of a minimum of 10% of the funds raised by demi throughout the year. This includes sponsors for the tournament, money I personally put in, etc.

We're actively updating, and adding to the lore. The goal is to create an enriched environment that you can dive into. If we become large enough, the goal is to create an animated series of the game. As such, we're writing lore, and events as a full fledged Anime/Video Game. 

The following is the basis of what we have:
 
Lore of Demi - 
No one knows when the gods of the Grand Pantheons first revealed themselves to man, but it must have happened in the time before history or the time even before that, when across the world the gods showed themselves to Man and taught him how to be something more than a mere animal. What is known from the arachnological record, however, is that it was the Egyptian Pantheon that first established a great stronghold on earth in the land of Kemet. For a thousand years the gods of Kemet and the sun-drenched men who served them grew in power to become the most sophisticated civilization in the arts of Science and of Building and of War. Perhaps it seemed then to both gods and pharaohs that they were destined to rule above and below for all eternity. But unbeknownst to them, the gods of the Greek Pantheon were full of cleverness and guile, they were beginning to teach their secret arts in the dark sanctuaries and sacred groves of Hellas. And so, in time the power of Hellas grew at length to rival the power of Kemet and again war erupted among the Grand Pantheons and among the nations of the earth. The priests and magi of the Egyptians called forth ghouls and monsters from the netherworld while the oracles and sages of Hellas summoned wondrous beasts and the sons of gods to wage battle on the land of Kemet, As they forged the age in terror and glory, both sides strove for supremacy, yet the fortune of gods and men was far more subtle than any could then see. 
               From the far cold fortresses of the frozen lands to which they had been exiled since the first celestial ages, the gods of the Norse Pantheon watched as the Greeks gained the upper hand over the Egyptians and drove their gods from the temples and high places of Kemet. The Norse saw too the wearying toll that the struggle had taken on Zeus, his family and the whole of Hellas. The power of Zeus, though formidably great, could not hold out forever, and the Norse gods were accustomed to the bitter torment of waiting through the endless winter; they were bitter but abiding in their patience for the proper moment to begin their machinations among men. 
               It seemed harmless at first, and so the gods of the Greek Pantheon had paid no heed. For what trouble could a few simple runes cause? They looked to be hardly more than wild chicken scratches in comparison to the penetrating light of Apollo or the unfathomable wisdom of Athena. And yet, through these runes, Odin began to impart the Great Wisdom, which he had acquired with enormous sacrifice, to the Men of the North, who grew stronger with each day. Just as the Greeks had been weakened by their victory, the Northmen had been strengthened by their hardship, and before long they had taken their swords and axes and spilled blood from the savage lands of the Far West and all the way to the eastern Kingdom of Rus so that they might do honor to their gods. 
               But even the blood-rich power of the Norse gods was doomed to fade at the close of of that age, for this is the nature of the world. Little is known what happened when the gods withdraw from the earth in the twilight between the ages. Perhaps they rest and dream. Perhaps they seethe and plot. Whatever their wont, not one god among Grand Pantheons could have foreseen what awaited them at the outset of the strange age that was to come. They returned to find themselves in a world in which children were taught to view the gods as myths, as historical curiosities, as mere trivia. There were only a scattered handful of men who still held them in honor, yet even these few had lost the old ways and proper worship. Not one of the sacred rites had survived intact and without the rites, neither gods nor men could properly wield their power. Every passing day left the Pantheons further from the energy that sustained their being on this plane. It seemed that this age was to be the last for all the elder gods who had once lifted man from the utter darkness in which he had dwelt in the most ancient days. 
               When they realized this, each Pantheon imbued a set of cards with the divine power that remained from the memory of their sacred rites. These artifacts had the power to summon all manner of beasts and monsters, even the gods themselves depending on their inscriptions. Then each Pantheon selected from its number an emissary to bestow these cards upon its faithful worshipers and to teach the hallowed secrets of their use. As these arcane cards spread across the earth, so would the power of the gods grow in proportion.                  What you have before you is just such a set of cards. Devotion and skill are needed to deploy them to the greatest advantage for your gods. The Greek, the Norse, the Egyptian gods, all have known the honeyed taste of victory and all have tasted the bitter nettle of defeat. Now you must do all that you can for your gods. You must use every kind of cunning and ruse. You must give everything of yourself so that once more your gods may have divine rule over the age! 

You have several types of cards. These are broken down into the following.
Creature Cards: Gods, Demi-Gods, & Monsters
Prayer Cards
Vain Cards
Worshiper Cards
Titan Cards
 
Creature Cards are separated as they share the same area on the battlefield.

On each card you have the following areas:

Creature Cards:
   God Cards:

God Card's are the strongest of the Creature Cards. They possess the most power. In order to play a God Card you must Ritual Sacrifice Three monsters, or two Demi-Gods. They will always have Power of 10+. They are unable to attack the first turn they're played.
 
Demi-God Cards:
Demi-God cards Power ranges from 5 - 9. They're the second strongest cards you can play. They require a Ritual Sacrifice of 2 monster cards (or 1 Demi-God). They are unable to attack the first turn they're played.

Monster Cards:
Monster Cards have a Power of 1-4. They can be played without any Ritual Sacrifice, and excluding both parties first turn, they can attack the moment they are played.

Prayer Cards:
Cards that help the player. Can only use on the players turn. These cards are often equip cards, Attack Bonus cards, Draw Cards, Follower Gain, Play from mythology, add defense to monsters, etc.

Vain Cards:
Cards that hurt the enemy. Can only be used on enemies turn. These cards often, lower attack, lower followers, See enemy cards, See part of deck, remove from mythology, remove defense from monsters, etc.

Worshiper Cards:
Defence cards. These are Creature cards that cannot attack, and can block any attack from another Creature.

Titan Cards:
Field cards. Have field effects such as boosts all Egyptian monsters +1.

Introduction
Hi there,
We're Gbrossoft, indie game developers made up of a team of three  (a programmer, an artist and a writer) We've recently started work on a new game 'The Breeding: The fog' scheduled for October 2016 release on Pc and Mac.

The Breeding is an open world third person shooter survival game which explores the effect of carbon emissions and climate change on the world. 

Set sometime in the near future where carbon-monoxide levels have reached unprecedented heights with an increased melting of the ice caps, a ground breaking experiment using genetically modified microbes to break down carbon-monoxide  to less hazardous molecules have been deployed into the atmosphere by world governments. This stride has  proven successful.

However, few months down the line, things have gone awry leading to the central theme of the game: 

Surviving in the persistent fog and erratic weather as well as battling unknown creepy creatures which appear with the fog.





Features of the game


- Two main story modes and a survival mode
- Four playable characters
- Night and day cycle
- Weather system
- Localizations in multiple languages (English, Russian, French, German, Italian, Polish, Spanish)
- Multiple enemy variant (NOTE - a mock up is currently used in the teaser trailer video)
- Scavenge for resources
- Collaborate with other surviving characters within the game
- and more......






What we need the money for

Our funding goal is $25000 which would be judiciously deployed in the following areas

-Purchase of the full licenses of the softwares and tools being used in the development of this project.
-Complete development of all levels/modes of the game as well as polishing.
-Develop unique soundtracks for the game(this would be available for download to our top paying contributors)
-Create a 3D animated story intro video
-Create more unique and edgy enemy creatures of various forms( a mock up is currently used in the trailer) as well as several other ancillary tasks aimed at providing the best user experience during game play







The Impact of your help!
 We are already about 40% through with the game on very little budget. We believe achieving our funding goal would help us complete the project smoothly and on time.

</div><br/></div>","The story of the projectMobile
 games are the next frontier, with more titles now being released on 
tablet and phones than any other platform. But unlike platforms built 
for gaming, mobile screens and the tiny controls they accommodate can 
get in the way of play. We built CUBE Gamepad CGX01 to make your
 Android tablet or phone a joy to play - and at a very affordable price.
 We've got your PC gaming covered too - with an optional USB 
receiver, the CGX01 is compatible with most PC systems.Ready to enjoy mobile gaming?Thousands of compatible gamesUse
 your CUBE gamepad with any of the thousands of already compatible games
 available on the CUBE store - or with any mobile or PC game with native
 controller support. Keeping 'em comingOur ongoing
 partnerships with game developers have allowed us to introduce more 
than 100 licensed games, with plans to triple that number in 2016 alone.
 Now, who's still bored?Available games in the store:Works with the works - Android smart phones, tablets, smart TVs and more. The
 CUBE gaming console is the perfect companion to Android phones, 
tablets, TV set top boxes and smart TVs. Simply insert the nano-receiver
 into the tablet or phone's USB port, and set your TV to mirror your 
device for a gaming experience as big as your biggest screen. You can also skip the middleman and get the optional USB receiver, which plugs directly into your computer or smart TV.2.4Ghz RF transmission technology with an 8-metre range. 2.4 GHz data transmission delivers a speedy connection over up to 8 metres, with virtually no delays, dropouts or interference.Classic button layoutThe CUBE

</blockquote><p>But there's something missing. Sports Passport currently covers three of the four major U.S. sports. Completing the square is where you come in.</p><h3>It's A Great Day For Hockey</h3><p>Hockey is a sport that requires serious devotion. Whether you're up north digging a car out of a January blizzard to get to the arena, or down South counting down to NHL Opening Day while everyone else is in football mode, love for the game is never skin-deep. For the past two years, hockey lovers have wanted a Passport of their own. We heard you. This summer, we want you to help us finally make Puck Passport a reality.</p><h3>Great Moments Are Born From Great Opportunity</h3><p>Puck Passport will provide everything that Hardball, Basketball and Football Passports already provide, but with a lot more slapshots and high sticking. Like our other products, we'll cover:</p><p><b>Where You've Been: </b>a comprehensive game database from 1980 to present</p><p><b>Where You Are:</b> game check-ins and a local game locator</p><p><b>Where You're Going: </b>arena bucket lists, competitive arena-chasing challenges and three-click road trip planning</p><p>Puck Passport will be the serious hockey fan's digital shoebox of ticket stubs, a community for collecting and sharing memories and photographs, and a way to plan a hockey road trip to test even the strongest marriage. There will be no place quite like it.</p><h3>Put The Biscuit In The Basket</h3><p>We are seeking at least $7,000 in funding to make Puck Passport happen in time for the 2015-16 NHL season. Those funds will go towards: </p><p></p><ul>

Since 2013, we've offered baseball, basketball and football fans a simple, fun and competitive way to keep track of every game they've attended. With our websites, fans can log old ticket stubs, view teams' records and top player performances when they've been in attendance, create stadium bucket lists, and compete with other fans in arena-chasing challenges.Hardball Passport, Basketball Passport and Football Passport have generated over 300,000 game checkins by our registered travelers. The sites have been featured in Sports Illustrated, Sporting News, Sports On Earth, New York Daily News, New York Magazine, NBA.com, SLAM, as well as many podcasts and blogs around the sports internet. ""You know that drawer filled with ticket stubs you can't bring yourself to throw away? Thanks to Passport, you may finally be able to clean house.""— Sports Illustrated""Hardball Passport is an absolute must for baseball fans.""— Will Leitch, Deadspin Founder""Players get box scores. Why not fans, too?""— Thomas S. Owens, Baseball Author
But there's something missing. Sports Passport currently covers three of the four major U.S. sports. Completing the square is where you come in.It's A Great Day For HockeyHockey is a sport that requires serious devotion. Whether you're up north digging a car out of a January blizzard to get to the arena, or down South counting down to NHL Opening Day while everyone else is in football mode, love for the game is never skin-deep. For the past two years, hockey lovers have wanted a Passport of their own. We heard you. This summer, we want you to help us finally make Puck Passport a reality.Great Moments Are Born From Great OpportunityPuck Passport will provide everything that Hardball, Basketball and Football Passports already provide, but with a lot more slapshots and high sticking. Like our other products, we'll cover:Where You've Been: a comprehensive game database from 1980 to presentWhere You Are: game check-ins and a local game locatorWhere You're Going: arena bucket lists, competitive arena-chasing challenges and three-click road trip planningPuck Passport will be the serious hockey fan's digital shoebox of ticket stubs, a community for collecting and sharing memories and photographs, and a way to plan a hockey road trip to test even the strongest marriage. There will be no place quite like it.Put The Biscuit In The BasketWe are seeking at least $7,000 in funding to make Puck Passport happen in time for the 2015-16 NHL season. Those funds will go towards: 

Design and construction of the user interface


Graphic design of the site's visual elements


Research and development of a database that doesn't exist yet: a statistically detailed, geotagged collection of every NHL game since 1980


Daily updates during the 2015-16 season via a reliable paid stats feed 

Once you've helped us get off the ground, Puck Passport will remain healthy and financially viable with the help of our paid premium product. For an annual fee, Passport Plus lets travelers view personalized, detailed, shareable player stats. Which player has the most goals when you're in attendance? Penalty minutes, saves, assists? Plus gives you the answers.You Miss 100% Of The Shots You Don't TakeOur primary challenge is time. We are beginning this campaign in late June, and the NHL season begins October 7. That gives us 100 days to raise funds, pay contractors, build databases, beta-test the site, and launch. Nobody said hockey was easy.

If we raise less than $7,000, we will launch the site in a limited fashion: three years' worth of game data and no Plus features. We will reopen fundraising and aim to launch the remainder of the features by the NHL All-Star Game.


If we raise less than $3,000, we will delay the entire Puck Passport launch, keep fundraising open, and aim to launch for the 2016-17 season.


If we raise less than $1,000, we'll return the funds and this never happened, just like the 2004-05 NHL season. (Sorry, still too soon.)

If we end up exceeding our goal, however, we will add features like NCAA and/or Canadian Junior league games. The bigger our database is, the better the site will be, and the more fun we'll be able to offer Puck Passport's registered travelers.The Final FlickThank you for considering supporting our project. We're looking forward to use our experience and track record to build a fun, exciting resource for anyone who loves the game of hockey.

<h3>                           ~~ Game Concept ~~<br/>
</h3>Long ago...there was a great war between fairies and dragons. For years, the human race was kept out of the war. However, the war soon came to a stand still. With no end in sight, dragons and fairies began teaching humans their powers. Humans learned how to harness the powers of nature, and became skilled with magical weapons and spells. <br/><br/>Trying to end the war...the Emperor Dragon and the King of The Fairies fought.<br/><br/>As they fought, they destroyed the landscape as they went. They broke the continent into five pieces. Each being dominated by different natural elements.<br/><br/><h4>Zephyr: Windy/Snow Covered Mountains (Air)</h4>
<h4>Pyre: Volcanoes and Lava Rivers (Fire)</h4>
<h4>Terrene: Desert (Earth)</h4>
<h4>Cataract: Marsh/ Wet Lands (Water)</h4>
<h4>Akin: Forest/Grassy Plains (Nature/Neutral)</h4>

<p>At the final battle, both leaders were destroyed along with many warriors. With no alternative the elders of both races met and developed a sense of peace. They both agreed to go their separate ways and stay away from the humans. <br/></p>
<p>Years after the war. A dark force is beginning to rise from the shadows. They believe they are the superior class, and only they should have knowledge of magical abilities. They call themselves the Dark Knights.<br/></p>

</div><div> <h3>                              ~~ The 4 Classes ~~</h3>
<h4>                                                 Dragon Discipline<br/>
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>Dragon wizards are Strong, badass,
sinister, dark, brute and terrifying. They are the type of people you do not
want to run into in a dark alley. Their spells are focused on inner power and are
mainly hand-to-hand and some distant spells.</p>
<p></p>
<p>         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1098893/files/20141215164637-Dragon_Default_Characters.png?1418690797"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Dragon Knight<br/>
</h4>Dragon Knights are close combat players. They use magic close range weapons like swords and axes. Along with weapons they can also use spells to improve their strength and defenses (Fire Punch/ Ice Shield).<br/><p>       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1102390/files/20141217033306-Dragon_Armor_1.png?1418815986"" src="""" style=""width: 559.71px; height: 622px;""/></p>
<p>                                                            (Knight Armor Level 1)<br/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<h4>Dragon Mage</h4>
<p>Dragon Mages are ranged players. They use large, area of effect, single attack spells. These spells are extremely powerful, but have a longer cool down time and takes a lot of mana.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1102395/files/20141217033803-Mage_Armor_1.png?1418816283"" src="""" style=""width: 558.041px; height: 631px;""/></p>                                                         (Mage Armor Level 1)<br/>
<br/>
<h4>                                                Fairy Discipline</h4>
<h4>
</h4>
<p>Fairy
wizards are whimsical, playful, peaceful, but don’t let your guard down. They
are extremely intelligent. Their spells are focused on outer power and are
mainly distant spells using weapon and tools/gadgets. They use the elements
around them to strengthen their powers.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Fairy Knight</h4>
<p>Fairy Knights are close combat players, but use long range magic weapons like crossbows and spears. Like Dragon Knights they also use their magic to improve their strength and defenses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1138822/files/20150108153618-Fairy_Knight_Armor_1.png?1420760178"" src="""" style=""width: 514.445px; height: 724px;""/></p>
<p>                                                    ( Fairy Knight Armor Level 1 )</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Fairy Elemental</h4>
<p>Fairy Elementals are ranged players. They use small, targeted, multiple attack spells. Even though these spells are weaker than the Dragon Mages, they have a much shorter cool down time, lower mana required, and can cast much more rapidly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1138830/files/20150108153854-Fairy_Elemental_Armor_1.png?1420760334"" src="""" style=""width: 528.506px; height: 705px;""/></p>                                           
( Fairy Elemental Armor Level 1 )<br/>
<br/><p>How
do fairies and dragons compare you wonder? Fairies have double the speed of
dragons, but ½ the attack power. Dragons are slower but have extremely strong
attacks. There is a basic 2 to 1 ratio. However, with the help of stats, items,
and skills you can easily turn the tides.</p>
<p>                                                         ~ Comparison Table ~<br/></p>

<h3>                                ~~ Gameplay ~~</h3>
<p>Once
you have chosen your class, you begin your journey to become a Grandmaster. No
matter what class you choose, you will be able to learn spells of the four main
elements, Air, Earth, Water, and Fire. You can either focus on one or a
combination of elements who are taught by elemental grandmasters for your
class. </p>
<p>The overall game play is this. You are a young wizard trying to
work your way up the ranks. You go from student, to apprentice, to wizard, to finally Grandmaster. Each level
having a ABC rank, C Rank being the lowest. The more you train, the more powerful and bigger your spells become. As a student you are weak and new to the vast
magical world. You need help! The game will be loaded with player guilds. </p>
<p>To raise your experience, there will be quests/jobs available:</p>
<p><b>Storyline Quests:</b><br/>The plan is for every region to have it's own conflict with the Dark Knights and become the hero of the region, and become protector of it's people from the dark forces. Each region will have a conflict with the Dark Knights inspired by the region's resource's and element. <br/><br/><b>General Jobs:</b><br/>These quests are for those who either do not want to join a guild and play solo, or do not want to do guild related quests. The quests that will be given are randomized and will be hunt, retrieve, and gathering quests. <br/></p>
<p>EX: Kill 5 npcs, collect drops, or go find items.<br/><br/><b>Guild/Party Jobs:</b><br/>Guilds will be given randomly generated, assigned, or offered jobs. These jobs will be used to  boost guild reputation, and help out guilds. These jobs can range from delivering items between NPCs,
killing and collecting, Boss monster battles, taking out other guilds or
players etc. You can either be the friendly guild or the group that everyone is
afraid of. The choice is yours.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>                                    ~~ NPCs ~~</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Npcs will match the environments they are found in. They will also have a mythical aspect to them (like the deer). Like flaming particle and glowing effects.</p>

<h3>     
Don't Worry! This game will be Free-To-Play!</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Growing up, I was from a low-income family. So all the games that 
required a monthly membership to play (*cough*World of Warcraft), I 
never got to play much of. The only time I could, was through trials and 
friend's accounts. So for me to expect the same would make me a hypocrite. I want everyone to be able to play this game!<br/></p>
<p>There will be only a one time fee to buy a reregistration code. Accounts will be the only thing registered that way you can easily move between computers! After that there will be no required membership to play!  So what is the purpose of selling the game and membership? Only reason... <b>PATCHES!</b> This game has the potential to have many patches and many ways to expand. I want everyone to have a game that they can play for a long time. However, it takes money to create new content! <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>I want to stay away from traditional membership in games. Majority of games today have the Pay-To-Win ideal behind it. This means if you are willing to pay you will have stronger gear than someone at the same level, or can have skills that normal players cannot. This always discouraged me in games, I want everyone to feel equal.<b> </b>In Tarragon, everyone will have the same armor, skills, weapons, etc. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>So what do I get with membership?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Exp Boosts</li>
<li>In-Game Items Discount</li>
<li>Ability To Purchase In-Game Cosmetic Gear/Items</li>
</ul>
So instead of being Pay-To-Win ideal, I want to have a Pay-To-Level/Support ideal. This basically means that members will be able to level up faster, and be able to acquire items easier. Members will be able to get exp boosts and gear/weapons to increase exp bonuses. Weapons will be the same strength as free players, but allows you to grind and level up faster. Also, all in-game items will be cheaper for members. This means instead of spending a lot of time getting money for items, you will be paying less and moving on quicker. Finally, everyone likes to look bad-ass. So instead of charging you more physical cash for cosmetic gear/items. You will simply be able to equip and buy membership items. For only the in-game currency, not physical cash!<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1115296/files/20141224074433-Development_Team.png?1419435873"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

I have always wanted to create a true online wizard vs wizard game that was not turn based and is real-time. However, unless you are well known or have a large company, it is impossible to get funding through traditional methods. Indiegogo is a great place for small developers like me to raise funds. Crowdfunding sites bring developers and their ideas together with those want to see their type of game succeed in development. This game will not be sold out to a major company. I plan on marketing the game myself (or with a marketing professional), and won't answer to anyone else but you, the dedicated fans.<br/><br/>Those who donate $25 or more will have exclusive access to a development forum I have created. This form will not only be a place to store my ideas, but a place for those who support this game to cast their say and vote. I want to create a game that everyone who donates will enjoy and will want to play endlessly. Lets work together to create an amazing game and show large game companies what small developers can do.<br/><p></p>
<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1099099/files/20141215180555-WhereMoney.png?1418695555"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
Your probably thinking, ""$1 Million Dollars!?! Thats ALOT!"". Well yes it is a lot of money, but when it comes to creating 3D games, it only covers the basics. <br/><br/><strong>Here is a list of recently developed games and their cost (2010 - Now):<br/></strong><strong></strong><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>
God of War III - $44 million</p>
<p>Rift - $60-70 million</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Borderlands 2  - $30-35 million<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>DC Universe Online - $50 million</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Watch Dogs - $68 million</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Defiance - $70 million</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Destiny - $140 million<strong><strong><br/></strong></strong></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Every penny donated (except for $10,000) will be spent on development, marketing, royalties, fees, and perks. I only plan on setting aside $10,000 for the whole year to cover my bills, so I can work on this game full time. Other than that, I have to hire people and companies. <br/></p>
<p>For example I will need to hire: <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Character/NPC Modelers</li>
<li>Animators<br/>
</li>
<li>Item Modelers</li>
<li>Landscape Modelers</li>
<li>Concept Artist</li>

No matter how much experience you have, there will always be challenges. Looking at this campaign page, especially the budget section, you can see development is planned out. Game development may also become longer than expected/projected. I am also in contact with very talented individuals who can create the perfect assets for this game. With programming, I will admit that I do not know everything about programming. However, through self learning and professional education, I am very confident in my skills, and my ability to over come whatever obstacle I may face. In addition, that is one reason why I want to hire another programmer. Not only can we bounce ideas and solutions off of each other, but I am only one person and with games there is a ton of code. So through the support of everyone, and the collaboration of talented people. I will give all I have to create the game that you all want.<br/><br/>My goal is to make a game that everyone will love, and play it endlessly. Being that this is my first major game, my only focus is to get it out to the world. That is why I have only set aside $10,000 for myself. <br/><br/>Like I said at the beginning of this page.

                                               (Concept Art : Idea/Not Gameplay)
                           ~~ Game Concept ~~
Long ago...there was a great war between fairies and dragons. For years, the human race was kept out of the war. However, the war soon came to a stand still. With no end in sight, dragons and fairies began teaching humans their powers. Humans learned how to harness the powers of nature, and became skilled with magical weapons and spells. Trying to end the war...the Emperor Dragon and the King of The Fairies fought.As they fought, they destroyed the landscape as they went. They broke the continent into five pieces. Each being dominated by different natural elements.Zephyr: Windy/Snow Covered Mountains (Air)
Pyre: Volcanoes and Lava Rivers (Fire)
Terrene: Desert (Earth)
Cataract: Marsh/ Wet Lands (Water)
Akin: Forest/Grassy Plains (Nature/Neutral)

At the final battle, both leaders were destroyed along with many warriors. With no alternative the elders of both races met and developed a sense of peace. They both agreed to go their separate ways and stay away from the humans. 
Years after the war. A dark force is beginning to rise from the shadows. They believe they are the superior class, and only they should have knowledge of magical abilities. They call themselves the Dark Knights.


                               ~~ The 4 Classes ~~
                                                 Dragon Discipline



Dragon wizards are Strong, badass,
sinister, dark, brute and terrifying. They are the type of people you do not
want to run into in a dark alley. Their spells are focused on inner power and are
mainly hand-to-hand and some distant spells.

         

Dragon Knight
Dragon Knights are close combat players. They use magic close range weapons like swords and axes. Along with weapons they can also use spells to improve their strength and defenses (Fire Punch/ Ice Shield).       
                                                            (Knight Armor Level 1)

Dragon Mage
Dragon Mages are ranged players. They use large, area of effect, single attack spells. These spells are extremely powerful, but have a longer cool down time and takes a lot of mana.


                                                                (Mage Armor Level 1)

                                                Fairy Discipline


Fairy
wizards are whimsical, playful, peaceful, but don’t let your guard down. They
are extremely intelligent. Their spells are focused on outer power and are
mainly distant spells using weapon and tools/gadgets. They use the elements
around them to strengthen their powers.


Fairy Knight
Fairy Knights are close combat players, but use long range magic weapons like crossbows and spears. Like Dragon Knights they also use their magic to improve their strength and defenses.

             
                                                    ( Fairy Knight Armor Level 1 )


Fairy Elemental
Fairy Elementals are ranged players. They use small, targeted, multiple attack spells. Even though these spells are weaker than the Dragon Mages, they have a much shorter cool down time, lower mana required, and can cast much more rapidly.

                                                      
( Fairy Elemental Armor Level 1 )
How
do fairies and dragons compare you wonder? Fairies have double the speed of
dragons, but ½ the attack power. Dragons are slower but have extremely strong
attacks. There is a basic 2 to 1 ratio. However, with the help of stats, items,
and skills you can easily turn the tides.
                                                         ~ Comparison Table ~

                             


                                ~~ Gameplay ~~
Once
you have chosen your class, you begin your journey to become a Grandmaster. No
matter what class you choose, you will be able to learn spells of the four main
elements, Air, Earth, Water, and Fire. You can either focus on one or a
combination of elements who are taught by elemental grandmasters for your
class. 
The overall game play is this. You are a young wizard trying to
work your way up the ranks. You go from student, to apprentice, to wizard, to finally Grandmaster. Each level
having a ABC rank, C Rank being the lowest. The more you train, the more powerful and bigger your spells become. As a student you are weak and new to the vast
magical world. You need help! The game will be loaded with player guilds. 
To raise your experience, there will be quests/jobs available:
Storyline Quests:The plan is for every region to have it's own conflict with the Dark Knights and become the hero of the region, and become protector of it's people from the dark forces. Each region will have a conflict with the Dark Knights inspired by the region's resource's and element. General Jobs:These quests are for those who either do not want to join a guild and play solo, or do not want to do guild related quests. The quests that will be given are randomized and will be hunt, retrieve, and gathering quests. 
EX: Kill 5 npcs, collect drops, or go find items.Guild/Party Jobs:Guilds will be given randomly generated, assigned, or offered jobs. These jobs will be used to  boost guild reputation, and help out guilds. These jobs can range from delivering items between NPCs,
killing and collecting, Boss monster battles, taking out other guilds or
players etc. You can either be the friendly guild or the group that everyone is
afraid of. The choice is yours.


                                    ~~ NPCs ~~

Npcs will match the environments they are found in. They will also have a mythical aspect to them (like the deer). Like flaming particle and glowing effects.

The graphics are a mix between World of Warcraft and Diablo 3. It is slightly more realistic than World of Warcraft, but still retains the animated effect. The models have a hand painted texture.

Don't Worry! This game will be Free-To-Play!

Growing up, I was from a low-income family. So all the games that 
required a monthly membership to play (*cough*World of Warcraft), I 
never got to play much of. The only time I could, was through trials and 
friend's accounts. So for me to expect the same would make me a hypocrite. I want everyone to be able to play this game!
There will be only a one time fee to buy a reregistration code. Accounts will be the only thing registered that way you can easily move between computers! After that there will be no required membership to play!  So what is the purpose of selling the game and membership? Only reason... PATCHES! This game has the potential to have many patches and many ways to expand. I want everyone to have a game that they can play for a long time. However, it takes money to create new content! 



I want to stay away from traditional membership in games. Majority of games today have the Pay-To-Win ideal behind it. This means if you are willing to pay you will have stronger gear than someone at the same level, or can have skills that normal players cannot. This always discouraged me in games, I want everyone to feel equal. In Tarragon, everyone will have the same armor, skills, weapons, etc. 

So what do I get with membership?

Exp Boosts
In-Game Items Discount
Ability To Purchase In-Game Cosmetic Gear/Items

So instead of being Pay-To-Win ideal, I want to have a Pay-To-Level/Support ideal. This basically means that members will be able to level up faster, and be able to acquire items easier. Members will be able to get exp boosts and gear/weapons to increase exp bonuses. Weapons will be the same strength as free players, but allows you to grind and level up faster. Also, all in-game items will be cheaper for members. This means instead of spending a lot of time getting money for items, you will be paying less and moving on quicker. Finally, everyone likes to look bad-ass. So instead of charging you more physical cash for cosmetic gear/items. You will simply be able to equip and buy membership items. For only the in-game currency, not physical cash!

I have always wanted to create a true online wizard vs wizard game that was not turn based and is real-time. However, unless you are well known or have a large company, it is impossible to get funding through traditional methods. Indiegogo is a great place for small developers like me to raise funds. Crowdfunding sites bring developers and their ideas together with those want to see their type of game succeed in development. This game will not be sold out to a major company. I plan on marketing the game myself (or with a marketing professional), and won't answer to anyone else but you, the dedicated fans.Those who donate $25 or more will have exclusive access to a development forum I have created. This form will not only be a place to store my ideas, but a place for those who support this game to cast their say and vote. I want to create a game that everyone who donates will enjoy and will want to play endlessly. Lets work together to create an amazing game and show large game companies what small developers can do.

Your probably thinking, ""$1 Million Dollars!?! Thats ALOT!"". Well yes it is a lot of money, but when it comes to creating 3D games, it only covers the basics. Here is a list of recently developed games and their cost (2010 - Now):

God of War III - $44 million
Rift - $60-70 million


Borderlands 2  - $30-35 million


DC Universe Online - $50 million


Watch Dogs - $68 million


Defiance - $70 million


Destiny - $140 million

Every penny donated (except for $10,000) will be spent on development, marketing, royalties, fees, and perks. I only plan on setting aside $10,000 for the whole year to cover my bills, so I can work on this game full time. Other than that, I have to hire people and companies. 
For example I will need to hire: 

Character/NPC Modelers
Animators

Item Modelers
Landscape Modelers
Concept Artist
User Interface Artist
Music/Sound Effect Artist
Visual/Particle Effect Artist
Additional Programmer

No matter how much experience you have, there will always be challenges. Looking at this campaign page, especially the budget section, you can see development is planned out. Game development may also become longer than expected/projected. I am also in contact with very talented individuals who can create the perfect assets for this game. With programming, I will admit that I do not know everything about programming. However, through self learning and professional education, I am very confident in my skills, and my ability to over come whatever obstacle I may face. In addition, that is one reason why I want to hire another programmer. Not only can we bounce ideas and solutions off of each other, but I am only one person and with games there is a ton of code. So through the support of everyone, and the collaboration of talented people. I will give all I have to create the game that you all want.My goal is to make a game that everyone will love, and play it endlessly. Being that this is my first major game, my only focus is to get it out to the world. That is why I have only set aside $10,000 for myself. Like I said at the beginning of this page. If you have any concerns/questions that you need answering before donating. Please do not hesitate to email me at:                                                 LunarSourceLLC@gmail.com 
With everyone's help we can make this game a success! Please tell your friends, family, co-workers, even the mail guy!  Short Link To This Page: http://igg.me/at/SupportTarragonPlease Share This Page On:

<h3>Who are we?<br/>
</h3>Founded by a husband and wife team of teachers, the Vector Jiu-Jitsu program (in Jackson, Mississippi) has been forging wildly fruitful mentoring relationships with children battling a devastating cycle of poverty, crime and violence in their beloved neighborhoods for the past 2 years.<br/><br/>Nikari is just one example of these fruitful relationships.  When he began training in the Vector Jiu-Jitsu program, he was an 18 year old sophomore in high school with no interest in graduation.  An innately gifted young man, with a father in prison, and a family struggling with poverty, Nikari was plagued by depression.  <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1204602/files/20150207191321-DSCF4029.JPG?1423365201"" src="""" style=""""/></p>With the martial arts training and mentoring guidance he was empowered with in Vector, Nikari is now the first male high school graduate in his family's history.  He's enrolled in college, eagerly seeking to be one of Vector Jiu-Jitsu's first <b>paid interns</b><i> </i>as we seek to expand this powerful impact to youngsters around the City of Jackson!  <br/><br/>""Make an effort, not excuses.""  has become his mantra.<br/><br/><h3>What do we do?<br/>
</h3> <p>Our program motto is: KNOW YOURSELF, BETTER YOURSELF &amp; HELP OTHERS</p>
<p><i>KNOW YOURSELF</i>:  Training in martial arts (in particular, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu) uniquely allows students to learn more about who they are and what they are capable of.  Training reveals truth, pure, inescapable truth about oneself. This is an opportunity rarely enjoyed in today's world.   <br/></p>
<p><i>BETTER YOURSELF</i>:  Whether it be discipline, health, or academics - the children of Vector Jiu-Jitsu must confront personal shortcomings and demand better from themselves.  They are held accountable for these improvements by adult mentors who spend approximately 10 hours a week with them, either in training, tutoring or general socialization.</p>
<p><i>HELP OTHERS</i>:  Children in the program constantly serve their community.  Neighborhood beautification, organic gardening, assistance to the elderly and various other outreach efforts are constantly evolving for our students to internalize the great satisfaction of a service lifestyle.</p>
<p></p>

<ul> </ul>
</div><h3>Why Vector Jiu-Jitsu?</h3><p>The children of Jackson are not safe walking home &amp; the academic achievement gap grows daily.  Despite millions being spent in education...too many young ones with vast intellectual potential have failed to find an identity or source of personal pride outside of the comfort of gang-life or scholastic malaise.  <br/></p><p>Lacking powerful, positive adult influences, many children will remain unable to make the proper choices to set their lives up for success.  <br/></p><p>With your help, Vector Jiu-Jitsu will service more &amp; younger children in the city.  We can provide 500+ children with a <i>permanent </i>outlet for physical, mental and emotional development.</p><p>WE  BELIEVE  WE  CAN  CHANGE  A  CITY.... DO  YOU?<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1204665/files/20150207200106-Kids_Camp_Collage.jpg?1423368066"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/> <div> <h3>Funding Use<br/>

Founded by a husband and wife team of teachers, the Vector Jiu-Jitsu program (in Jackson, Mississippi) has been forging wildly fruitful mentoring relationships with children battling a devastating cycle of poverty, crime and violence in their beloved neighborhoods for the past 2 years.Nikari is just one example of these fruitful relationships.  When he began training in the Vector Jiu-Jitsu program, he was an 18 year old sophomore in high school with no interest in graduation.  An innately gifted young man, with a father in prison, and a family struggling with poverty, Nikari was plagued by depression.  With the martial arts training and mentoring guidance he was empowered with in Vector, Nikari is now the first male high school graduate in his family's history.  He's enrolled in college, eagerly seeking to be one of Vector Jiu-Jitsu's first paid interns as we seek to expand this powerful impact to youngsters around the City of Jackson!  ""Make an effort, not excuses.""  has become his mantra.What do we do?
 Our program motto is: KNOW YOURSELF, BETTER YOURSELF & HELP OTHERS
KNOW YOURSELF:  Training in martial arts (in particular, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu) uniquely allows students to learn more about who they are and what they are capable of.  Training reveals truth, pure, inescapable truth about oneself. This is an opportunity rarely enjoyed in today's world.   
BETTER YOURSELF:  Whether it be discipline, health, or academics - the children of Vector Jiu-Jitsu must confront personal shortcomings and demand better from themselves.  They are held accountable for these improvements by adult mentors who spend approximately 10 hours a week with them, either in training, tutoring or general socialization.
HELP OTHERS:  Children in the program constantly serve their community.  Neighborhood beautification, organic gardening, assistance to the elderly and various other outreach efforts are constantly evolving for our students to internalize the great satisfaction of a service lifestyle.

(showing our classmates and Principal how to make fresh juice at school)
 
Why Vector Jiu-Jitsu?The children of Jackson are not safe walking home & the academic achievement gap grows daily.  Despite millions being spent in education...too many young ones with vast intellectual potential have failed to find an identity or source of personal pride outside of the comfort of gang-life or scholastic malaise.  Lacking powerful, positive adult influences, many children will remain unable to make the proper choices to set their lives up for success.  With your help, Vector Jiu-Jitsu will service more & younger children in the city.  We can provide 500+ children with a permanent outlet for physical, mental and emotional development.WE  BELIEVE  WE  CAN  CHANGE  A  CITY.... DO  YOU?  Funding Use

<p></p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Race and Faction are entirely separate choices. All races can choose allegiance to the Roman State or to the Barbarian Rebels. Race is more of a cultural choice and will come with a unique faith option and prestige item. Race will largely be a matter of roleplay and how you choose to play your character.</p>
<p>Faction allegiance is something that can be chosen at the beginning of your journey, however allegiance can be switched although this comes with a heavy Prestige debuff and it not something you can do on a daily basis. You are able to make a pledge of allegiance to either faction, and not make another one for a game year, or month, or reasonable period of time.</p>
<h2>Crafting</h2>
<h1></h1>
<p>To have all of the things you need and want, players will have to travel around the world and interact with others positively or negatively – In turn this will encourage travel and trade for both factions. This will stimulate politics within factions, as well as against the opposing faction. Having resources spread across the map will encourage crafting specialisation.</p>
<h2>Real Time Combat</h2>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1338542/files/20150330063950-Photogrammetry1-1024x484.jpg?1427722790"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p>Unlike many traditional MMORPG’s, we’re approaching combat as organically as possible. We want to give the player a chance to learn, adapt and increase their skills in combat through realistic training. Timing will be crucial – when you attack, block or dodge will determine survival, as well as the power you put behind an attack and how close you stand to the enemy.<br/></p>
<p>Your actions will effect your Prestige. If you are Roman allegiance, enemy kills will increase prestige, but killing your own faction will decrease it. Barbarian allegiance will  receive prestige for combat regardless of whether they kill Romans or Barbarians. Your prestige will be the sum of all of your parts, all of your skills, stats, attributes, faith bar, and valuable possessions in game such as armour, weapons, livestock, fine clothing, jewellery and decorative items and any land you own, money, titles you hold and reputations you have. Prestige can also be the measure of whether you are classed as a noble or a plebeian for Romans and a Noble or a Freeman for Barbarians.</p>

<h2>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Religion</span><br/>
</h2>
<h1></h1>
<p>This mechanic can reflect real practices performed by ancient people, brought into game as a way of boosting craft specialisation, and as part of a faith and healing system. High faith will also contribute to your overall Prestige score. Faith drains very slowly and would be a more long term goal than others.</p>
<p>A player would raise their faith bar by praying to particular gods, or by making offerings or sacrifices at their home fire, the town fire or a temple. In return sometimes their prayers will be heard by the gods (by chance, depending on how high a person’s faith is, where and what has been offered) they will receive a temporary bonus, related to the god they made the offering to, which will affect a particular crafting operation, combat, one of their attributes or stats, or bars.</p>
<h2>Weather</h2>
<h1></h1>
<p>The world features a full 24 hour day &amp; night cycle complete with a range of dynamic weather effects. It renders physically based realtime atmospheric scattering, dynamic wind speed &amp; direction and continuous dynamic moon phases.</p>
<p>Your characters ‘Comfort’ can be affected by the weather – staying sheltered during rain or keeping warm during the night will help keep your comfort level’s normal. This also applies to the suitability of the clothes you are wearing for the the task at hand, for example – working a furnace may decrease comfort, but visiting the bathhouse or taverna afterwards will negate the effects.</p>

Updates
#1: Development Update 1

Life of Rome is a third and first-person massively multiplayer online action role playing game (MMORPG) set in 320AD Rome. The game is played from the point of view of both Roman and Barbarian; designed to emphasise roleplay and community using a faction system and player-driven politics. The in-game world is a 50km2 representation of Rome and its surrounding areas, including several small villages and Roman forts. We are an independent team called Breakout Studio, passionate to create a game we’ve been wanting to play. The game started development in February 2014, since then we’ve been following feedback from the community. This has helped us to build and adapt our roadmap to create a game we all want to play.   
Players interact with each other in a series of locations spread across the area. Major roleplaying-based storylines, purely optional, will be started and run by Breakout Studios staff as well as players. Players in a position of power may also affect gameplay by setting a faction’s agenda, creating long-term political, economic, or military goals, which are broken up into missions handed down through a faction’s hierarchy in the form of player generated and driven missions.

Factions & Race



Race and Faction are entirely separate choices. All races can choose allegiance to the Roman State or to the Barbarian Rebels. Race is more of a cultural choice and will come with a unique faith option and prestige item. Race will largely be a matter of roleplay and how you choose to play your character.
Faction allegiance is something that can be chosen at the beginning of your journey, however allegiance can be switched although this comes with a heavy Prestige debuff and it not something you can do on a daily basis. You are able to make a pledge of allegiance to either faction, and not make another one for a game year, or month, or reasonable period of time.
Crafting

To have all of the things you need and want, players will have to travel around the world and interact with others positively or negatively – In turn this will encourage travel and trade for both factions. This will stimulate politics within factions, as well as against the opposing faction. Having resources spread across the map will encourage crafting specialisation.
Real Time Combat

Unlike many traditional MMORPG’s, we’re approaching combat as organically as possible. We want to give the player a chance to learn, adapt and increase their skills in combat through realistic training. Timing will be crucial – when you attack, block or dodge will determine survival, as well as the power you put behind an attack and how close you stand to the enemy.
Your actions will effect your Prestige. If you are Roman allegiance, enemy kills will increase prestige, but killing your own faction will decrease it. Barbarian allegiance will  receive prestige for combat regardless of whether they kill Romans or Barbarians. Your prestige will be the sum of all of your parts, all of your skills, stats, attributes, faith bar, and valuable possessions in game such as armour, weapons, livestock, fine clothing, jewellery and decorative items and any land you own, money, titles you hold and reputations you have. Prestige can also be the measure of whether you are classed as a noble or a plebeian for Romans and a Noble or a Freeman for Barbarians.




Religion


This mechanic can reflect real practices performed by ancient people, brought into game as a way of boosting craft specialisation, and as part of a faith and healing system. High faith will also contribute to your overall Prestige score. Faith drains very slowly and would be a more long term goal than others.
A player would raise their faith bar by praying to particular gods, or by making offerings or sacrifices at their home fire, the town fire or a temple. In return sometimes their prayers will be heard by the gods (by chance, depending on how high a person’s faith is, where and what has been offered) they will receive a temporary bonus, related to the god they made the offering to, which will affect a particular crafting operation, combat, one of their attributes or stats, or bars.
Weather

The world features a full 24 hour day & night cycle complete with a range of dynamic weather effects. It renders physically based realtime atmospheric scattering, dynamic wind speed & direction and continuous dynamic moon phases.
Your characters ‘Comfort’ can be affected by the weather – staying sheltered during rain or keeping warm during the night will help keep your comfort level’s normal. This also applies to the suitability of the clothes you are wearing for the the task at hand, for example – working a furnace may decrease comfort, but visiting the bathhouse or taverna afterwards will negate the effects.







Oculus Rift


Life of Rome supports the Oculus Rift head-mounted display (HMD), the first video footage of the game running on an Oculus DK2 shows brief snippets of the Roman architecture and characters. Recorded from a first-person perspective, it gives an idea of how the game looks and feels from the eyes of a Roman character.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Crooked Deck</strong> is a regular deck of cards.... until it's not. In addition to the standard set of Jacks, Aces and Kings, we've added a few wild cards; a political version of Gin Rummy without the Gin. (<i>Or with the gin... your choice</i>) Like Gin Rummy, your goal is to get a set of four similar cards, i.e. four Kings, four “8’s”, etc. any card and a run of three such as 4, 5, 6, etc. Get one set of four and two runs of three and you lay down your cards. <strong>Bam!</strong> You’ve won your first “Primary.”</p>
<p>The game instantly takes a recognizable ""political"" turn with each card you draw because the wild cards will take your average gin rummy game and add a bit of good, old-fashioned corruption. For example, when you draw <strong>Clinton-</strong>the<strong> Woman Card</strong>, you steal any players card. Draw a <strong>Trump</strong>-the<strong> Wall Card</strong> and you block any players next turn.</p>

<p>The game was created by Doug Crowe and his international team of designers &amp; marketers. Crowe is an unapologetic critic of politics and all around nice guy. We looked at Kickstarter, but those guys seemed a bit high-brow (...<i>rules</i> and all) so we chose Indiegogo. Anyway, we can't build this without you. In fact, there's a BIGGER play in mind. <strong>""Huge... Fantastic!"" </strong> More on that in a moment...</p>
<p>If you're into card games, politics or creating drinking games in the garage, please help us make this game a reality.  It's probably more important than voting... and much more interesting.</p>
<p>We promise to make fun of everyone, too...</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>The funds raised will go to getting our designer a real computer. <i>""Seriously... ditch the PC, Ognen!""</i> We will also use the funds for our support staff and legal team to make sure our irreverent humor wouldn't get us a visit from the secret service. <i>""Hi guys!""</i> Of course the bulk of the funds will go creating the actual game! <strong>Your perks!</strong>
</li>
<li>We are starting with three (3) different card games. At the top of the list is our signature game, the <strong>Trump Deck</strong> in <i>Putin</i> red. Complete with a host of celebrities who have officially endorsed the candidate including Pete Rose, Dennis Rodman and others.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473092517/rdtabjolyvug72dtdvna.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul><li>Next up, we are rolling out the <strong>Hillary Deck</strong> in <i>Lewinsky</i> blue dress. Her cards include celebrity endorsements such as Beyonce, George Clooney, Robert De Niro and her husband, Bill Clinton.</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473093657/xoqwgb81cfudvyqih5ww.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul><li>Third on the roster, is a personal favorite. Our the <strong>WTF Deck</strong> comes in royal purple, celebrating the dissolution of the 2-party system, cronyism, a bloated Federal government, the introduction of term limits and transparent accountability! Once all of that is accomplished, 100% of the profits will go to our unicorn ranch. </li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473093887/ghuy8ldgnaeehvxllc8v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are confident we'll exceed our very modest goal. But hey, if for some reason we don't; we'll refund your perk. No problemo! which is a grammatically incorrect way of saying ""no hay problema"", although it becoming more common among the 11 Spanish speaking Trump supporters in the United States. <i>""Look it up! I ripped that right from WikiHow.""</i></p>

<h3>Something for Everyone!</h3>
<p>Listen, we know most people are not overly enthused about their choices. It seems there are more <strong>#NeverHillary</strong> or <strong>#NeverTrump</strong> people than all out raving fans for either candidate. We feel your frustration. (Still #feelthebern ?) </p>
<p>That is why we designed 3 separate decks of cards to appease, please &amp; <strong>insult everyone equally.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">===========================</p>
<p><strong>ADAPT THE GAME:</strong> If you <i>really</i> want to have fun, buy 2 decks. Use the Non-partisan deck box &amp; insert the Trump Deck cards inside (for maximum right wing conspiracy power). Then, invite over all your friends from Berkeley and pretend to play with the Non-partisan deck. The ""frothing Progressives"" may tear out your liver in an expression of their tolerance and peace, but you'll never have more fun. Of course, if you actually went to Berkeley, do the same thing... just reverse the process: Use the Hillary deck cards and insert into the Non-partisan deck. Not sure if this will work. It may depend on how many NASCAR friends you actually have...</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">===========================</p>
<p>We are initially launching 3 separate playing card decks. Each deck is a complete set of playing cards and each deck also includes custom wild cards <strong>guaranteed to offend</strong> someone.</p>
<h3>The ""Trump"" Deck</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472937091/egiaqwu5yfjp7mmseb5b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This deck is exclusively in English. The Patriot edition comes in ""Putin"" red.</p>
<h3>The ""Hillary"" Deck</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473023694/dizxnadk3npv0p8tbbqd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The ""Hillary"" Deck is in perfect health. Guaranteed to last more than 2 terms.</p>
<h3>The ""WTF Happened to our Country"" Deck</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472937116/mxoc6mf52btp3pup3ove.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Can't decide if you'll lose friends by having a <strong>""Hillary""</strong> or <strong>""Trump"" </strong>deck of cards in the house? No worries. Get our Non-partisan <strong>""WTF Deck""</strong> in royal purple.</p>
<h3>Collector's Edition</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473641429/lywtzl4ixwd52gjtkjgb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You know the golden rule? No... not the one your grandmother taught you... the real one.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""Whoever has the gold makes the rules!"" </i></p>
<p>Our collectors edition is an exclusive opportunity to get a 2-deck, collectible set. Select 2 decks of your choice and we'll print them on super-dee-duper plastic cards and put them in a gold foil case. This is a limited print run. Once printed, we will NOT print any more... ever. Seriously. I'm keeping one for my kids, after all...</p>
<p><i>""Will they worth something some day?""</i></p>
<p>Well, don't open the package, Johnny!</p>
<p>Certainly in 20 years, you can try to sell them on <strong><i>Pawn Stars XXI</i>.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">###</p>
<p>Backing this project won't do anything to swing votes or debug the malware in the voting machines. But, you can put a smile on the faces of your friends in an otherwise cantankerous election. <strong>Select a perk</strong> on the right and have fun!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Are there risks with this? <strong>YES!</strong> The biggest risk in life is taking ourselves too seriously. While this election has certainly not delivered the best and brightest America has to offer, it certainly has created more <strong>INTEREST</strong> in politics and that might actually be a good thing in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>Crooked Deck</strong> is not designed to influence the election, but it will bring a fun perspective to an otherwise depressing situation.</p>
<p><i>""Are there any other challenges? You know... like development or delivery?""</i></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The designs are all done and we will start shipping immediately! The only actual risk is treating this Indiegogo campaign like the Presidential campaign. Don't sit on the sidelines... pick a perk and let's deal!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Are you creative? After looking over this campaign do you have an idea for your own game?  Cool! We'd love to hear from you. Drop us a line and share away.</p>
<p>If you don't have an idea, here's a few things to get the creative juices flowing!<br/>(Crooked Deck idea contest with <strong>prizes</strong> coming soon!)</p>

<h3>Isn't it Time to Share Some Political FUN?</h3>
<p>From $2 to $5,000, Crooked Deck will be the most fun project you've ever backed. However, if even the $2 option is not for you, please share this campaign with your friends and on social media. Convince <strong>THEM</strong> to buy the game so you don't have to. They already know you're cheap... don't worry, they won't be shocked.</p>
<p>Indiegogo has some brain-dead simple sharing tools at the top, so click away and be that person who shares something cool.</p>

What We Need & What You Get

The funds raised will go to getting our designer a real computer. ""Seriously... ditch the PC, Ognen!"" We will also use the funds for our support staff and legal team to make sure our irreverent humor wouldn't get us a visit from the secret service. ""Hi guys!"" Of course the bulk of the funds will go creating the actual game! Your perks!

We are starting with three (3) different card games. At the top of the list is our signature game, the Trump Deck in Putin red. Complete with a host of celebrities who have officially endorsed the candidate including Pete Rose, Dennis Rodman and others.


Next up, we are rolling out the Hillary Deck in Lewinsky blue dress. Her cards include celebrity endorsements such as Beyonce, George Clooney, Robert De Niro and her husband, Bill Clinton.

Third on the roster, is a personal favorite. Our the WTF Deck comes in royal purple, celebrating the dissolution of the 2-party system, cronyism, a bloated Federal government, the introduction of term limits and transparent accountability! Once all of that is accomplished, 100% of the profits will go to our unicorn ranch. 

We are confident we'll exceed our very modest goal. But hey, if for some reason we don't; we'll refund your perk. No problemo! which is a grammatically incorrect way of saying ""no hay problema"", although it becoming more common among the 11 Spanish speaking Trump supporters in the United States. ""Look it up! I ripped that right from WikiHow.""


Something for Everyone!
Listen, we know most people are not overly enthused about their choices. It seems there are more #NeverHillary or #NeverTrump people than all out raving fans for either candidate. We feel your frustration. (Still #feelthebern ?) 
That is why we designed 3 separate decks of cards to appease, please & insult everyone equally.
===========================
ADAPT THE GAME: If you really want to have fun, buy 2 decks. Use the Non-partisan deck box & insert the Trump Deck cards inside (for maximum right wing conspiracy power). Then, invite over all your friends from Berkeley and pretend to play with the Non-partisan deck. The ""frothing Progressives"" may tear out your liver in an expression of their tolerance and peace, but you'll never have more fun. Of course, if you actually went to Berkeley, do the same thing... just reverse the process: Use the Hillary deck cards and insert into the Non-partisan deck. Not sure if this will work. It may depend on how many NASCAR friends you actually have...
===========================
We are initially launching 3 separate playing card decks. Each deck is a complete set of playing cards and each deck also includes custom wild cards guaranteed to offend someone.
The ""Trump"" Deck

This deck is exclusively in English. The Patriot edition comes in ""Putin"" red.
The ""Hillary"" Deck

The ""Hillary"" Deck is in perfect health. Guaranteed to last more than 2 terms.
The ""WTF Happened to our Country"" Deck

Can't decide if you'll lose friends by having a ""Hillary"" or ""Trump"" deck of cards in the house? No worries. Get our Non-partisan ""WTF Deck"" in royal purple.
Collector's Edition

You know the golden rule? No... not the one your grandmother taught you... the real one.
""Whoever has the gold makes the rules!"" 
Our collectors edition is an exclusive opportunity to get a 2-deck, collectible set. Select 2 decks of your choice and we'll print them on super-dee-duper plastic cards and put them in a gold foil case. This is a limited print run. Once printed, we will NOT print any more... ever. Seriously. I'm keeping one for my kids, after all...
""Will they worth something some day?""
Well, don't open the package, Johnny!
Certainly in 20 years, you can try to sell them on Pawn Stars XXI.
###
Backing this project won't do anything to swing votes or debug the malware in the voting machines. But, you can put a smile on the faces of your friends in an otherwise cantankerous election. Select a perk on the right and have fun!

Risks & Challenges
Are there risks with this? YES! The biggest risk in life is taking ourselves too seriously. While this election has certainly not delivered the best and brightest America has to offer, it certainly has created more INTEREST in politics and that might actually be a good thing in the long run.
Crooked Deck is not designed to influence the election, but it will bring a fun perspective to an otherwise depressing situation.
""Are there any other challenges? You know... like development or delivery?""
No.
The designs are all done and we will start shipping immediately! The only actual risk is treating this Indiegogo campaign like the Presidential campaign. Don't sit on the sidelines... pick a perk and let's deal!

Other Ways You Can Help
Are you creative? After looking over this campaign do you have an idea for your own game?  Cool! We'd love to hear from you. Drop us a line and share away.
If you don't have an idea, here's a few things to get the creative juices flowing!(Crooked Deck idea contest with prizes coming soon!)

Isn't it Time to Share Some Political FUN?
From $2 to $5,000, Crooked Deck will be the most fun project you've ever backed. However, if even the $2 option is not for you, please share this campaign with your friends and on social media. Convince THEM to buy the game so you don't have to. They already know you're cheap... don't worry, they won't be shocked.
Indiegogo has some brain-dead simple sharing tools at the top, so click away and be that person who shares something cool.

<p>We are three students who share one childhood dream: to build our own games. Together we have set up our own indie game studio, and the Cublast adventure is our first big step towards making our dream reality.   </p>
<p>In the last months we have dedicated all our time and effort to developing Cublast. Unfortunately, hard work is not always enough. In order to make Cublast HD the best it can be, while actually surviving in the process, we are going to need some resources. </p>

<h2>So what is Cublast HD?</h2>
<p>In 2015, we released our first mobile app, ‘Cublast’, a minimalistic modern arcade game to play on your phone. 350,000 downloads and a lot of positive feedback later, we have decided to take it to the next level with Cublast HD, a console version with many exciting new features. What stays the same is the foundation, which is best described with a horrible but wildly appropriate gaming cliché: easy to learn, but hard to master.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481536167/hidvjmrupnssjcsoqrn7.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Cublast HD is all about practicing your agility in a variety of challenging levels. Each level has a starting point and an exit. In order to complete a level you will have to jump, roll and bounce around to collect blast points. The more blast points collected, the higher your overall score. Sounds easy, right? Well, it is. At first. But every level-up means new obstacles and dangers that will test your skills. Expect frustration, expect fulfillment, but above all, expect some serious fun.</p>

<p>Miners have the abilities to control their spaceship using a wrist ship controller. This gives them a top down view of the ship. Using this map they can construct robots or turrets to seek out and eliminate the Pirates. Miners can open and lock doors, turn off gravity in a room or vent gas into the room.

<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>Your support will allow us to upgrade from Unity Personal Edition to Unity Pro. We can significantly enhance Programming, Animation &amp; Audio in Capitalist with the Pro version of Unity. Ensuring that you get the best possible gaming experience.</p>
<p>We're firm believers that keeping players actively involved in the development cycle is what makes a great game. After our success with the Alpha, showcased at Dublin Comic Con in August 2016 and taking third place at Dublin Beta in December 2016. We were able to get valuable feedback from players on what works &amp; what doesn't. With your support you will help us bring Capitalist to International gaming events such as Gamercon, Spiel 2017, Insomnia Gaming Festival &amp; more.</p>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>With Capitalist, players will experience a unique blend of Real Time Strategy with both, FPS &amp; Third Person gameplay elements. The competitive aspects of Capitalist allow us to build a tournament based community in which players can chose to either, casually play with friends or sharpen their skills to climb the leaderboards and compete in exclusive Newlove hosted events.</p>
<p>If our goal is achieved, the game will be released on Steam, which in turn will help us fund other passionate indie gamers projects and contribute to helping them realise their ambitious projects.</p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>This project has had risks and challenges from the beginning. Starting out we were surrounded by those longing to attempt a project like Capitalist but due to the daunting nature of taking on a challenge like this, it would always remain a dream.</p>
<p>We however got creative and focused on making the best with what little resources we had at our disposal.</p>
<p>The game will be released on Steam whether we meet our funding goals or not, however the risk of not meeting our goal here, will mean we won't be able to fully realise the potential quality of Capitalist.</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>We understand that not everyone can contribute financially, there are many other ways you can give us your support.</p>

The owner of that game never talked to most of his players and only logged on to take donations and then left. It was then I vowed I could do better. I taught myself how to code and made my own game where I actually interacted with my players, making lasting friendships with people who still play my game 8 years later, through all of the different versions. Being in poverty my whole life, I could never afford hosting for my game consistently, meaning I had to stop and start over a lot. I am finally at a point in my life where I can afford stable hosting and invest in my game, where I want each and every player to know I'm available and I want them to have a great gaming experience, one that molds to their choices, one where there are always multiple choices and you are never stuck on one path if you change your mind after a choice. I want my game to be the player's game, too. I wach each player to know their game experience is different than anothers. To do this, I need help raising money to invest more time and resources. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>To begin, we're raising $500 to put towards hosting, development, and most importantly, the look of the game. We are in talks with a pixel artist who will create the characters, items, icons and more needed for an aesthetically pleasing gameplay experience. No one wants to stare at text and buttons all the time. Our players want to see that epic sword they just looted off of a dungeon boss. Our players want to see what their character looks like now that they bought and equipped that awesome new blue mohawk they just purchased from the premium store. Our players want to see that special icon that only a Game Master has next to their name in chat and the forums. We need to add imagery that shows just how exciting that new NPC is in town that is selling the awesome items you can now see the icons to! <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>Since the day I started to learn how to code, creating an excellent and addictive gameplay experience for anyone who played my game has been my dream. This campaign will allow me to bring so much more to the game, which in turn brings more to the players, which is my ultimate goal. This game has been my baby since 2007, and I am determined to get to the final stage of development to provide a bug-free, action-packed, fun-filled gaming experience that is different for each and every player. I know with your help, we can get there!<br/>

</div></div>","Short SummaryWhen I was a teen, I played many browser based RPG games, but one in particular is what fueled me to learn how to code my own. The owner of that game never talked to most of his players and only logged on to take donations and then left. It was then I vowed I could do better. I taught myself how to code and made my own game where I actually interacted with my players, making lasting friendships with people who still play my game 8 years later, through all of the different versions. Being in poverty my whole life, I could never afford hosting for my game consistently, meaning I had to stop and start over a lot. I am finally at a point in my life where I can afford stable hosting and invest in my game, where I want each and every player to know I'm available and I want them to have a great gaming experience, one that molds to their choices, one where there are always multiple choices and you are never stuck on one path if you change your mind after a choice. I want my game to be the player's game, too. I wach each player to know their game experience is different than anothers. To do this, I need help raising money to invest more time and resources.

We had no choice but to do as we were told, since not all, but some of our publishers and investors did not understand that our concerns were justified.There was a long list of technical issues – most notably catastrophic bugs and glitches that caused many crashes, threw players out of the levels or caused them to get stuck.In the end, the game that we were forced to release was an alpha-version with a lot of potential, but little to no polishing and a number of catastrophic flaws.We have since spent four years – some of us unpaid for some of the time, others for all of the time - working very hard to repair the broken bits, and what we’ve come up with is in all honesty a decent and honest First Person Shooter.Unfortunately, in the end we lacked the means to keep up the very expensive infrastructure necessary to host the quite terrible “Free to Play” payment system, so TI had to be shut down.  First of all, we want to bring TI: Reloaded out on STEAM in 04/2018 for USD 14.99 in a one-time-payment that gives you access to every weapon, every piece of equipment and anything else that is relevant to the gameplay. From the Map Kit to the Co-Op, from car chases in normal mode to the highspeed, no-nonsense levels in pro-mode and the fully customizable clan servers in both.  So ok, wait - what? Car chases? In an FPS?! And yet you want this to be a competitive game for professional gamers?Yep.  Because we made sure that both the Casual and the Professional gaming community should find whatever they need in TI:R.For casual gamers, the game offers the ""Normal"" game mode.Car chases, multi-stage scenarios with background story, lots of things to see and to do, and levels to explore; we'll even put in a Co-Op mode that we'll tell you more about later on.For professional gamers, there will be a Pro game mode. Very fast maps with 200-300 fps, more options to choose from, extremely precise collision models, lots of weapon settings to adjust, and a basic, no-nonsense feeling that brings back memories from the sleek and nimble counter-terrorism games of the past that for some reason grew a bit old and fat over the years...  Now that the five of us have been working so hard towards fixing it, we want to deliver it, too.That means to rip out anything related to the F2P-concept, including the cumbersome inventory and shop system. We want the game to be accessible, simple and fun, yet precise and properly balanced. If this campaign and the relaunch turn out to be really successful, we want to add more features, such as an entirely new Co-Op game mode called “L.A.”; and then, the longer we can keep our artists and coders entertained, we want to give you all that is currently still hiding in the darker corners of our twisted minds.And there is a lot left in there… Most of all: the game doesn’t feel like a rushed beta-version anymore.  It’s much more precise, faster and better looking, movement is smoother, many bugs, crashes and glitches are gone, and there is much more to see thanks to five additional levels. For those of you who hated specific things about “Old TI”, there is a list of about half the fixes we have made (and found the time to write down) and with a bit of luck, maybe you will find your favorite glitch in it.

    Initially, Tactical Intervention was made and released by FIX Korea Ltd., a small company based in Seoul, and went through several publishing attempts. Today, we are publishing the game ourselves as FIX Games Ltd. which is based in the small town of Jeonju, South Korea.After most of the original team left FIX in 2014, only Tony “Omega” Sergi and Til “Albatros” Sichel were left to work on TI.

<p><strong><b>The Afterglow Miniatures Miniatures Game is a tabletop strategy game designed for two or more players, set in a grim world devastated by an apocalypse.</b></strong></p>
<p>Players lead bands of survivors who clash against each other in a struggle for survival among the ruins of towns, burned-out wastelands and underground bunkers.</p>
<p>The game, based on the<b> intuitive mechanics,</b> is <b>fast and dynamic.</b> Depending on the format it takes <b>from 40 to 90 minutes</b> to play, while the number of miniatures in warbands varies<b> from 4 to 20 models</b>, depending on the chosen faction.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458149681/lbzyqxkj9rgahabsgjlw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Afterglow is different from many other wargames. First of all, <b>it is a game of survival</b>. Victory is not always on the side of those who deal the biggest damage to the opponent.</p>
<p><strong>S</strong><b>cenarios and Mission Cards</b> provide an opportunity to win the game without firing a single shot, relying on the player's intelligence, strategic planning skills, anticipation of opponent's moves and clever use of unit skills and abilities. </p>
<p>We have also <b>created a system of playing campaigns</b> - connected scenarios, during which members of your warbands can gain experience, develop skills, plunder and find new equipment, but also sustain permanent injuries, fall victim to diseases and mutations or eventually die.</p>

<p>The game is becoming increasingly popular in Poland. For over a year we have been organizing meetings and tournaments, where you can meet many amazing people and test yourself as leader of a post-apocalyptic gang.

<p><b>Now we would like to offer you the sixth faction, </b>long awaited by many Afterglow players and fans.</p>

<p>Forsaken are driven by rage. They attack with unusual ferocity and brutality, showing no mercy nor compassion. Their sole motivation is to fight, plunder and feast on their victims. This is a faction focused on an offensive playing style and close quarters fighting.</p>

Players lead bands of survivors who clash against each other in a struggle for survival among the ruins of towns, burned-out wastelands and underground bunkers.
The game, based on the intuitive mechanics, is fast and dynamic. Depending on the format it takes from 40 to 90 minutes to play, while the number of miniatures in warbands varies from 4 to 20 models, depending on the chosen faction.

Afterglow is different from many other wargames. First of all, it is a game of survival. Victory is not always on the side of those who deal the biggest damage to the opponent.
Scenarios and Mission Cards provide an opportunity to win the game without firing a single shot, relying on the player's intelligence, strategic planning skills, anticipation of opponent's moves and clever use of unit skills and abilities. 
We have also created a system of playing campaigns - connected scenarios, during which members of your warbands can gain experience, develop skills, plunder and find new equipment, but also sustain permanent injuries, fall victim to diseases and mutations or eventually die.

The game is becoming increasingly popular in Poland. For over a year we have been organizing meetings and tournaments, where you can meet many amazing people and test yourself as leader of a post-apocalyptic gang. Now we would like to present Afterglow to players and miniatures enthusiasts in other countries.
Download free beta rules and take part in the open tests. 
 

At the moment five factions are available for Afterglow MG. Each of them delivers a different playing style and aesthetic feel.

Now we would like to offer you the sixth faction, long awaited by many Afterglow players and fans.
Forsaken are rejects of post-apocalyptic societies. Their ranks include outlaws, mutants, cannibals and those infected with the Black Mouth disease.

Forsaken are driven by rage. They attack with unusual ferocity and brutality, showing no mercy nor compassion. Their sole motivation is to fight, plunder and feast on their victims. This is a faction focused on an offensive playing style and close quarters fighting.
  


The main goal of this campaign is to release the Starter Set for a new Afterglow faction - Forsaken. 





 













 

A Forsaken Faction Starter Set is not all we can offer you. If your support reaches levels indicated below, we will be able to release even more Afterglow miniatures and accessories.
Check out Stretch Goals, help us to unlock them and expand your warbands!

But as they climbed higher up the tower, they found out the truth behind the god's true motive for the war...<br/>Lenio is a 19-year old young man who lived deep in the forest with his 10-year old sister, Linna. Even after their parents died from a hunting accident, they kept on living a peaceful life. Their village was far from the war zone. Linna hoped for Lenio to become a Summoner and bring her to his adventures. Everything changed on the day, when the demon Astaroth invaded the village and killed his sister right in front of him. The devastated Lenio swore to become a mighty Summoner, with guidance from Glauox, a mysterious owl person. He goes on a journey to end the war himself, like he promised his now-deceased sister.

We wanted to make the game <strong>different from other spaceshooters</strong> by limiting your ability to shoot. The only way you can replenish your ammo is by absorbing asteroids or enemies, but be aware that absorbing enemies comes at a cost, it takes out some of your energy.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/B1RLFindRUfE193qVS/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p><p>     Another key mechanic is <strong>the teleport</strong>.

<li>
<strong>Max Health</strong>: Upgrades the maximum health of your ship, but keep in mind that you can only refill it with drops from the enemies.</li>
<li>
<strong>Energy Regen</strong>: Your ship continuously regenerates energy. With this stat you can improve how fast this regeneration goes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Max Ammo</strong>: The storage for ammunition on the ship is limited. By upgrading this stat you can now hold more ammunition.</li>

<strong>Ship Speed</strong>: Sometimes all you want to do is just go faster, this gives you more speed.</li>

You can go check it out by following this link:     As this is our first project we wanted to get accustomed to the engine and build something that we are proud of. Keeping that in mind we started from a basic topdown spaceshooter template and added unique mechanics to it.     The most important mechanic in the game is the absorb. We wanted to make the game different from other spaceshooters by limiting your ability to shoot. The only way you can replenish your ammo is by absorbing asteroids or enemies, but be aware that absorbing enemies comes at a cost, it takes out some of your energy.     Another key mechanic is the teleport. By not using the classic portrait view of different spaceshooters you are left with more room in which to move. To traverse this space more quickly or to dodge enemy attacks you can use the teleport. This also takes out a small portion of your energy.     Last but not least, the most clasic mechanic in all spaceshooters, you can shoot down all the enemies on screen by using your ammo.     After you complete a sector you will be rewarded with an upgrade point. You can use these points to upgrade any of the seven different stats. All stats have a three tier progression, the more you want to upgrade it the more points it will cost. These stats are:

Max Health: Upgrades the maximum health of your ship, but keep in mind that you can only refill it with drops from the enemies.

Energy Regen: Your ship continuously regenerates energy. With this stat you can improve how fast this regeneration goes.

Max Ammo: The storage for ammunition on the ship is limited. By upgrading this stat you can now hold more ammunition.

Ship Speed: Sometimes all you want to do is just go faster, this gives you more speed.

Absorb Ammo: Each asteroid and enemy that you will absorb will give you more ammunition.

Absorb Range: If you every feel like you just can't reach what you wanted with the absorb you can upgrade its range.

Luck: Increases the chance of health drops from killed enemies.
      You are aboard a new prototype science vessel deployed into the far reaches of space to test the new Magnetic Pull drive by absorbing different energy filled asteroids and analysing them.     You find out that the drive can modify the mass and molecular density of everything that it absorbs. After playing with it you find out that you can also launch the modified mass of the absorbed objects out at high velocity. You tweak the drive even further and it creates a small wormhole that teleports you to a different vector coordonate. You get a bit concerned because this uses a small part of your ships energy.     After some successful testing you decide to head back to Earth by using the drive, only to find that your homeworld was destroyed almost completely by three alien races.     One of the remaining headquarters on Earth fills you in on what happened. You decide you want to take revenge on the alien races by using the Magnetic Pull drive to jump to their location in space. Your mission? Destroy everything in sight.      Because we wanted to make each world feel different we filled them with unique enemies. There are three main factions that you will need to battle throughout the game.War Faction     Thought from birth that the only way to survive in life is to mercilessly beat down all who oppose you the war faction's arsenal reflects what it means to stay alive in this world. They are equipped with shields, deadly exploding mines and kamikaze pilots.Tech Faction     More interested in unraveling the mysteries of the universe than fighting, the tech faction has special ways with which to confuse the enemy. They are equipped with ships that can phase, shoot static energy fields and turn invisible.Chaos Faction     Wild and unpredictable the chaos faction strive on everything that doesn't make sense in the universe. Their motto is ""We'll find a way to make this work"". They are equipped with fast moving ships, special ammo that can temporarily blind you and big lasers.      In your quest for revenge you will have face all three alien races with a split progression. Meaning that you can travel and complete the worlds in any way that you see fit. You will have to kill all the enemies present in each sector in order to progress.     You will have access to 2 different gamemodes, story and arcade.     In Story mode you will need take out each sector of enemies step by step while also learning the truth behind what really happened in the alien invasion back on Earth. You will have unlimited continues for each sector in case you die.     Arcade mode is more challenging, you start out with 3 lives and have to go as far as you can with them while also trying to get the highest score. After finishing it, either by winning or running out of lives, you will be prompted to save your score for the rankings page.      After working hard for a few months we are very close to finishing the development of the Arcade mode. We managed to get this far by implementing our own machanics, but we realised that if we wanted to make this game a unique experience we need to invest some money in custom soundtracks and visuals. We will also need to use some of this money to finish up the story and to market the game to a bigger audience.                              Like what you see but you don’t feel like you can contribute?

Killing a member of the order was off the charts for that rescue. Every day many members were trying the astral projection, with no avail. For they were quickly noticed and attacked by being different from the others, so all of their attempts were frustrated. After considering a lot, they decided to take a drastic measure: Find the worst member of the order and cause him a lot of damage so he can enter into a NDE (Near-Death Experience) state, and then his astral body would be separated from the physical body during the mission and he would take the imprisoned Nephalin back to the upper astral planes.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508330827/i7udi4huscqecyf161dk.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The protagonist of this journey, Rivail Kuth, was chosen to realize this mission.

<h2>Enter The Chalkboard...</h2> <p>I  Started Chalk Board Game Reviews so I could
have the best of both worlds: It was a way for me to focus my creativity, and
to enjoy my favorite hobby, playing games. Since I have started last year it has evolved into something special.   I have produced over 100 videos on the site!  We have series like ChalX-Wing and Beeroshima Hex.  We now have a podcast.  There is a cost involved though.  I have invested a lot in the channel, here's why:</p> <ul> <li><p>I appreciate good audio and visual quality</p></li> <li><p>I prefer well written and filmed overviews</p></li> </ul>
<div>Check out the 3 levels of audio from camera mic, to sound recorder, and then background noise removal (my pellet stove)</div>

<p>If you watch a video from when I started to where I am at
now you will see the difference in quality. 
I have a hard time watching the old stuff and wonder ""how did I get
any followers?""  Which brings me to
you.  If it wasn't for <b>YOU</b>, my audience,
I would not be doing this at all.  I

</div></div>","Enter The Chalkboard... I  Started Chalk Board Game Reviews so I could
have the best of both worlds: It was a way for me to focus my creativity, and
to enjoy my favorite hobby, playing games. Since I have started last year it has evolved into something special.   I have produced over 100 videos on the site!  We have series like ChalX-Wing and Beeroshima Hex.  We now have a podcast.  There is a cost involved though.  I have invested a lot in the channel, here's why:  I appreciate good audio and visual quality I prefer well written and filmed overviews 
Check out the 3 levels of audio from camera mic, to sound recorder, and then background noise removal (my pellet stove)


 
If you watch a video from when I started to where I am at
now you will see the difference in quality. 
I have a hard time watching the old stuff and wonder ""how did I get
any followers?""  Which brings me to
you.  If it wasn't for YOU, my audience,
I would not be doing this at all.  I
would love all of YOU to be a part of The Chalk.

My First Chalkboard Review: 

Current Content:
   ""Your Name Here"" We have been putting out a lot of content! Come be a part of it!  Be a part of The Chalk!  Grab this chance to get your name on the chalkboard for the next year.  It will be seen in a new credit roll at the end of every video!  If you do not want your name public I put down whatever you want (as long as it is not vulgar:)
The goal of $1200 will help us cover expenses, to keep producing content, buy equipment to improve quality and efficiency, give us more time to work on videos, and help us get to conventions to further promote the channel and podcast 
If we fund 100% here is what will happen:

ChalX-Wing Season 2
More ChalX-Wing!  When we reach our goal we will produce a new season of ChalX-Wing (12 episodes for the next season)

  No Ads!


I will disable all ads on the YouTube channel


New Series!


I will create a new series called ""5 minute Overview/Refresher"" It will be just like the segments of our reviews that show the details of a game.  I plan on producing more of these even if there is no review attached. Examples:
