<p>
In Reflections of the Legend, a four book series,
Genny and Lance's whirlwind romance sends the young lovers on an unimaginable, remarkable
and sometimes heartbreaking journey to the sixth century, and back again.
Genny’s present and the past collide in the adventure of her lifetime and
create a legendary love story that is rivaled by no other in history.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><b>Who Am I?</b></h3>
<p>That used to be a hard question, but now I can enthusiastically say I’m a published author. I still get butterflies in my stomach when I say that. After my last Indiegogo, I was finally able to have Book 1, Passion of a New Day professionally edited and my first book was released on September 4, 2014. It was one of the most satisfying and terrifying things I have ever done. I have heard nothing but wonderful responses and each person I’ve spoken too can’t wait for the next installment. That leads me here again, to raise funds to have Book 2, Embracing Destiny, professionally edited and published with Trafford Publishing.<br/>I had written little bits and pieces of Reflections of the Legend over the last 10 years, but they were just short stories and thoughts. It was almost three years ago, that I began writing Reflections Of The Legend as a book. I began to write as an escape from what was happening in my life. My mother had been diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. The emotions that take hold of someone facing that news are hard to deal with. I channeled my raw emotions into writing. Eventually my escape became conversation starters and I began to share my story with others. I decided to post each chapter to my blogger page as I wrote. After many months of writing, over 900 pages and 3800 people viewing my story online, a friend talked me into publishing my story in 3 different manuscripts. It was a terrifying notion, putting my work out there, in book form, for others to judge. Even after publishing Book 1, Passion of a New Day, I still get nervous with each new sale, hoping that they love the story and characters as much as I do. I took my friends advice but as the story was written, it hadn’t ended. There were still too many questions unanswered. So a 4th installment was call for, Beyond the Legend, which is about 90% complete at this point. I can actually say I am proud of myself for following through with the first book. I was able to release it only weeks before my mother passed and I know she is cheering me on to continue with my dreams.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I hope to raise $5000 in this campaign. Any and all money received from generous donations (even if I don’t reach my goal) will go to the cost of editing and publishing costs, as well as perk fulfillments.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Sneak Peek of Embracing Destiny</strong></h3>
<div><strong></strong></div>
<p>Lance
turned and strode out the door. Genny watched him walk down the sidewalk to the
sedan that was waiting for him. He climbed into the back seat and lowered his
head, sobbing into his hands. His sorrow turned to anger, which he let out on
the headrest of the seat in front of him. He punched it repeatedly until it
flew off the seat and hit the front window. He collapsed back into the seat and
covered his face with his hands. His driver started the car and drove away. A
slight tinge of regret tried to seep into her thoughts, but it was quickly
out-weighed by the feeling of betrayal.</p>
<p>Genny
stood in the doorway watching the car disappear then looked
at the world around her. Everything had changed for her, but the entire world
was the same. The sun was still shinning, the birds were chirping. <i>How dare it be that way?</i> she thought to
herself. A darkness was growing deep within her and she was filled with a
bitter sadness that chilled her soul. There had been so much to look forward to
and now there was nothing. A gaping black-hole of emptiness and sorrow
collapsed around her. She fell to her knees as if all the bones in her legs and
arms were gone. Genny slowly shook her head back and forth in disbelief, in a
dizzying whirlwind of suffering, not knowing what was real or imagined, what
was up or down. The world was spinning at light speed around her. She sat,
starring out the door, catatonic with grief.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Aquesta campanya de micro-mecenatge l'he creat per aconseguir publicar la meva segona novel·la titulada ODIN en format llibre i ebook.</p>
<p>Donada la gran quantitat de demanda que tinc per part dels meus lectors des de fa quasi un any, he decidit tirar pel dret de la mateixa manera que ho vaig fer amb El Diamant d'Herkimer, del que estic molt orgullós pels resultats que m'ha donat.</p>
<p>ODIN té un públic precís i també a la vegada més ampli, ja que en comptes d'una novel·la d'aventures sobrevingudes aquest nou relat s'enclava dins de la ben considerada novel·la històrica.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Per col·laborar amb el projecte només cal que cliqueu al botó de <b>""Contribuir"" </b>de la dreta, però si us dóna algun error<b> també em podeu fer un ingrés al compte corrent </b>indicant referència ODIN i el vostre nom i enviar-me mail a <b>info@davidfrigola.com</b> per tenir el vostre contacte i poder-vos donar la recompensa per la vostra gentilesa.</p>

<h2>SINOPSI<br/>
</h2>Ens situem a Portbou, any 1944. A l'altra banda de la frontera existeix una França ocupada, un món en flames. <br/><p><i><br/></i></p>
<p><i>La Maria, una jove alemanya, es troba de nit vigilant des de la muntanya l'estació de ferrocarril, un enclavatge primordial que separa dues existències dispars, la calma i la guerra. Està esperant que arribi un carregament estranger que pretén infiltrar-se dins de l'Espanya de postguerra. Ella és l'encarregada de vetllar i de donar notícia de qualsevol moviment; una dona que, víctima dels seus errors del passat, de les seves pors més obscures, es veu obligada a actuar d'una manera que anys enrere no hagués ni somiat: <b>contra els seus.</b><br/></i></p>
<p><i>Malgrat que sembla una tasca molt senzilla la Maria no sap on s'ha ficat. El que ha de ser una operació rutinària esdevindrà l'operació més perillosa i important de totes, la que pot guiar cap a l'èxit als Aliats o a l'Eix (Alemanya-Itàlia-Japó), una conxorxa que portarà al lector a reviure els grans moments europeus des del 1914 fins el 1944, passant per Barcelona, Munic, Berlín, Madrid i finalment Portbou.<br/></i></p>
<p><i>I entre totes aquestes sorpreses la Maria haurà de saber amb qui confiar i amb qui no, qui és, qui vol ser i vèncer els seus temors, alguns dels quals li passaran factura.</i></p>

</div></div>","La meva segona novel·la

 
Aquesta campanya de micro-mecenatge l'he creat per aconseguir publicar la meva segona novel·la titulada ODIN en format llibre i ebook.
Donada la gran quantitat de demanda que tinc per part dels meus lectors des de fa quasi un any, he decidit tirar pel dret de la mateixa manera que ho vaig fer amb El Diamant d'Herkimer, del que estic molt orgullós pels resultats que m'ha donat.
ODIN té un públic precís i també a la vegada més ampli, ja que en comptes d'una novel·la d'aventures sobrevingudes aquest nou relat s'enclava dins de la ben considerada novel·la històrica.

Per col·laborar amb el projecte només cal que cliqueu al botó de ""Contribuir"" de la dreta, però si us dóna algun error també em podeu fer un ingrés al compte corrent indicant referència ODIN i el vostre nom i enviar-me mail a info@davidfrigola.com per tenir el vostre contacte i poder-vos donar la recompensa per la vostra gentilesa.

SINOPSI
Ens situem a Portbou, any 1944. A l'altra banda de la frontera existeix una França ocupada, un món en flames. 
La Maria, una jove alemanya, es troba de nit vigilant des de la muntanya l'estació de ferrocarril, un enclavatge primordial que separa dues existències dispars, la calma i la guerra. Està esperant que arribi un carregament estranger que pretén infiltrar-se dins de l'Espanya de postguerra. Ella és l'encarregada de vetllar i de donar notícia de qualsevol moviment; una dona que, víctima dels seus errors del passat, de les seves pors més obscures, es veu obligada a actuar d'una manera que anys enrere no hagués ni somiat: contra els seus.
Malgrat que sembla una tasca molt senzilla la Maria no sap on s'ha ficat. El que ha de ser una operació rutinària esdevindrà l'operació més perillosa i important de totes, la que pot guiar cap a l'èxit als Aliats o a l'Eix (Alemanya-Itàlia-Japó), una conxorxa que portarà al lector a reviure els grans moments europeus des del 1914 fins el 1944, passant per Barcelona, Munic, Berlín, Madrid i finalment Portbou.
I entre totes aquestes sorpreses la Maria haurà de saber amb qui confiar i amb qui no, qui és, qui vol ser i vèncer els seus temors, alguns dels quals li passaran factura.
Sorpreses, aliances contra-natura, amor, acció, espies, enganys i intriga donen a la novel·la els ingredients principals per aventurar-s'hi i descobrir què amaga ODIN.

<h4><b>The really short introduction</b></h4>
<p>Futures of democracy?! is a democratic book about democracy. In its content
and its form it resembles many of the benefits and problems of democratic
politics. It also has a focus on the future, making it more practical than most
other books on political theory and philosophy.  </p>
<p>With your help we can realize this unique and important project; hopefully the first of many to follow.<br/></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p>This book will be different. We want to create a book that makes people wonder why there are not more books like this, a book that redefines how topics are presented. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This is why we decided to take things in our own hands. After years of studying and working with books, we decided to publish a book that really helps people to learn and appreciate the subject it presents.</p>
<p>We have two guiding ideas: </p>
<p>1. form and content should resemble each other.</p>
<p>2. complex matter can be presented in a challenging, engaging and provocative way.</p>
<p>Many people want to learn, they want to be interested in a topic, they want to become really engaged, but the way information is presented can make this difficult. Thus, we wondered, how can we really engage people? </p>
<p>The best way to engage people with a topic is to present it in a democratic way. Choose a theme, let people have a say in the topics that will be treated, let them ask questions, let the authors reply, stage debate and discussion - not only at the end of the book but throughout. This creates a unique space for you – the reader – to reflect on where you stand. Many other books do not help you think, they don't really sharpen your understanding. <br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Why is the democratic approach best suited, according to us? What makes democracy so popular and strong? It allows people to decide about their own lives. It is not a king or the aristocracy that decides for you - in a democracy, you are the one who decides. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Democracy allows you to really engage in what concerns you. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p>Discussion and debate provide fuel for change. They provide new insights, new ways of looking at the future, new ways of shaping the future. </p>
<p>Democracy is all about debate, about contestation, about discussing your views on the world with people that hold different views.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We decided that only one topic would be suitable for the first book created according to this philosophy: democracy. </span></p></span><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">So in our book, we continually show that there are multiple perspectives,
that every position can be contested, that every argument can be
questioned. </span><br/></p>

<p><span style=""font-style: italic; line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p>This book is unique because the discussion is on
each page. In order to represent this, we need alternatives apart from just
plain text: we need boxes, colors and photos. Only by printing this book high
quality and in color will it have the impact we want it to have. But color
printing is expensive. As a young company we have no funds to pay it forwards.
Since we believe in this book, we hope you follow us and make our dream a
reality.</p>
<p>Then there is an idealistic reason. With this book we want to make a
constructive contribution to politics and thinking about politics around the
world. </p>
<p>Winston Churchill once said that democracy was the worst form of
government, except for all other forms that have been tried. In other words:
democracy is here to stay, whatever might be wrong with it. This is why it is
essential to talk, think, and debate about its future, about how it relates to
the market, to human rights and to religion. This is why we should question who
holds the power, what is right and what is wrong, who we consider 'part of the
people', and many more things. Democracy touches us all - it is our future.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;"">Follow Up Goals</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We fell in love with this format of publishing. We consider many topics
suitable for our approach. It is so fruitful to create an open minded exchange
of thought, and to give experts from different backgrounds a place to freely
exchange insights. Readers will remember more of what they have read and they
will be able to really form their own thoughts about the topic of the
books. </p>
<p>This is what we'll do when we raise enough money:</p>
<p>1. Many of our contacts in the Arab world tell us that they would love to have a book like this. There is a big shortage of ideas and texts about democracy there. People want to think about democracy and new political arrangements, but they lack the necessary input to do this. Therefore, we will create an Arab translation and get the book published and distributed in the Middle East.</p>
<p>2. Produce a hardcover version of <i>Futures of Democracy?! </i>Funders who would receive a paperback will receive a hardcover if we'll produce one.<br/></p>
<p>3. Continue with a line of books in the mould of <i>Futures of Democracy?! </i>We already have some ideas:</p>
<p>- We intend to treat topics such as globalisation, the rise of
non-governmental powers (ngo's, international organisations, etc.), islam and
democracy, and many more. </p>
<p>- We would love to create and publish a book about how peoples' behavior
can be influenced based on the insights of social psychology and neuroscience.
There are so many practical, ethical and policy-related issues surrounding this
topic that it almost literally begs for a book based on our approach.</p>

</h3></div></div>","About Us:

The Conium Review is a small press
publication from Portland, Oregon.  We publish poetry and fiction from
local, national, and international authors.  The first issue is due out in
February, 2012.  The issue will be roughly
150 pages with a full-color cover and professional binding. 

Our Funding Goals:

The Basics:
Your donation supports independent
writing and publishing, giving us the funds to...


Expand our distribution, getting
the first issue into bookstores and libraries.
Support our podcast,
featuring readings/interviews with authors/editors.
Host upcoming literature
readings/workshops.


In More Detail:
We use online technology
to stay in touch with our readers, but we are firm believers in the importance
of print media, bookstores, and libraries. 
Our current budget lets us fulfill pre-orders and maintain the website,
but we need a little extra funding to print additional copies and expand into
new bookstore distribution channels.  In
short, this campaign gets our print journal into the hands of more readers.


While the print edition
is our main priority, this IndieGoGo campaign also gives us funds to continue
podcast production and host readings in the community.  If we exceed the funding goal, we can put the
additional money toward CLMP dues, getting tables at conventions, upgrading our
website, and marketing the issue.

Even $1 helps.  Please
support The Conium Review and independent publishing.  Remember to tell your friends and spread the
word on Facebook and Twitter.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Now the book is inspiring others. We stand here at the crossroads of civilization, the Shift is upon us, are we determined to run off the cliff because we are egotistical enough to insist that we are right, or can we relax a bit, smile a bit, laugh a bit, hug a bit, and believe that the Horse we are riding knows the way?</p>
<p>Join us! Together we can start a movement! People are joining in and we want to take this way of creating life out on the road. Encourage folks that this is an idea whose time has definitely come!</p>
<p>Gifts of Gratitude is a book about Grace: the enchanting, unexpected, and sometimes downright dazzling shapes that the gifts of Grace can take. These Gifts can surprise, delight, inspire, and at times actually take your breath away. And by the way, the translation of Grace really means the re-entrance of the Divine Feminine. Wouldn't it be spectacular - spectacular if all we have to do to save our world is to get the Divine Feminine and the Divine Masculine together for a little love fest?</p>
<p>So we have the Gifts of Gratitude, but the greatest Gift is all is LOVE.</p>

Over my six years of writing, I’ve connected with an incredible community – a community that is smart and funny and compassionate and simply amazing. So I’ve also made a point to steadfastly refuse to put advertising on my site.

But it certainly doesn’t pay the bills.</p>
<p>So in lieu of banner ads for lube that will make your tender bits tingle, I’m holding this little fundraising campaign. It’s modest, though necessary. Blogging is a simple endeavor, but you still need certain essentials. In my case, I am in dire need of a little technical upgrading. My laptop is well over three years old and has developed a severe limp. And I’d also like to pick up various accessories and software to be able to improve the quality of my daily offerings. Yes, ladies and discerning gentleman, I’m trying to deliver the biggest, best and most beautiful Tank Top Tuesdays to you that I can.</p>
<p>Right, so this is the part where I shuffle up to you, hand extended, and ask for some change. Thank you for coming to my site, thank you for wanting to help. Anything is appreciated. And thanks, of course, for reading.</p></div>","Dorothy Surrenders

<p>Your funding will allow me to dedicate my time to writing this and getting myself known as an author.</p>

<p>Your funding will enable me to acquire new equipment for making videos plus it will also allow me to focus my time on creating them for you.</p></span><p></p>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>I have set quite a high goal of £20,000 - though I do not expect to raise this much. £20,000 would allow me one entire year to focus all my time and efforts into my writing and making quality YouTube videos without having to worry about distractions and general life activities.</p>

<p>As the list progresses in price, the perks become even more unique (but I don't honestly expect them to be met anyway).</p>
<p>Please note that any signed copy of the hardcover book will only have free delivery to UK residents. Anyone not within the UK will need to provide shipping costs (but not printing costs, the book itself is free regardless).</p>

<h3>The Expectation</h3>

Please note that any signed copy of the hardcover book will only have free delivery to UK residents. Anyone not within the UK will need to provide shipping costs (but not printing costs, the book itself is free regardless).



The Expectation
I honestly do not expect much of a result from this campaign. Ideally, I would love to believe that I would reach the goal and then I could spend an entire year making my dreams come true - because it is something that I really want.
Should I somehow manage to meet or exceed my target - I will be able to entirely focus all my efforts into my writing and my YouTube career. The quality of both shall be enhanced by this, allowing me to create great products.

A Final Word...
I would just like to thank you for even taking the time to view my campaign - whether you donate or not is entirely up to you, but I thank you nevertheless.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I make Service Dog Vests for disabled veterans, free of charge.  Each vest is specially created for each
veteran from their own service uniform.  The insignia, service
patches, rank, unit, branch, name labels, etc, (from each member) is
incorporated into their vest creating a unique one-of-a-kind vest.  Pockets are removed from the uniform and included on each vest.  The
result is a wide array of configurations of vest designs, styles, and
sizes each specifically created for that service member and his/her
service dog.</span></span></font></font></font></p>

- Our young service men and women have given so much, and even though
they are home, many are still in the “battle” - the battle to
reintegrate back into civilian life.  In many cases a Service Dog can
assist in the support of the service member's reintegration.  A Dog
Vest identifies the dog's purpose and mission.  A Service Dog is part
of the support team, dressed in the service member's uniform.  The
vest is adorned with insignia, patches, and even medals earned during
the warrior's service.</span></p>

PURPOSE -
I make Service Dog Vests for disabled veterans, free of charge.  Each vest is specially created for each
veteran from their own service uniform.  The insignia, service
patches, rank, unit, branch, name labels, etc, (from each member) is
incorporated into their vest creating a unique one-of-a-kind vest.  Pockets are removed from the uniform and included on each vest.  The
result is a wide array of configurations of vest designs, styles, and
sizes each specifically created for that service member and his/her
service dog.

When
a dog wears a vest created from the service member's own uniform, the
dog wears the pride each member has earned.  The dog and vest also
take on the role of battle buddy which was so important while in
action.
WHY
- Our young service men and women have given so much, and even though
they are home, many are still in the “battle” - the battle to
reintegrate back into civilian life.  In many cases a Service Dog can
assist in the support of the service member's reintegration.  A Dog
Vest identifies the dog's purpose and mission.  A Service Dog is part
of the support team, dressed in the service member's uniform.  The
vest is adorned with insignia, patches, and even medals earned during
the warrior's service.

MY
GOAL –
is to keep up with the increased demand for these one-of-a-kind
Service Dog Vests, at no charge for our Heroes.
WHO
AM I - I retired two years ago after 25 years working as a
Federal Government employee!  I've worked for the Army, Navy,
Airforce, Department of Justice and NASA.  The last 15 years was
spent in the law enforcement field.



HOW
DID I GET HERE - About two years ago, I be-friended a woman who was
running a non-profit organizaton called Hounds4Heroes Tampa Bay.  She
was taking homeless shelter dogs and training them to become service
dogs able to assist military veterans suffering with Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other “hidden disabilities.”
Thinking
this was amazing, I volunteered to assist in some way......
Well,
they needed vests and I happen to be able to sew!
One
day, a soldier asked if I could make his service dog's vest from his
military jacket and insignia/patches he had worn while serving his
Country in Afghanistan . . . . 

And,
hence, my custom, one-of-a-kind service dog vest was born!

I
started posting photos of these amazing dogs wearing their custom
designed vests on my Facebook Page:
Facebook - DogVests4Vets
Word
quickly got out.  I now have soldiers contacting me from all over the
United States.  I encourage you to view my Facebook Page and see all
the warriors and their four-legged companions that I have been
honored to serve.
What's
up Now - I started a website, DogVests4Vets,
in August of this year. This website has helped me reach more
veterans and improve the process of ordering a free vest. The website
also serves as a journal, listing all my terrific heroes and their
dogs sporting their new vests.
Over
the last two years, I have had the honor of making dog vests for over
a hundred deserving veterans and their dogs – FREE OF CHARGE.   I
have never charged a fee for my vests.  I wanted to give back to my
Heroes – they deserve it!
TODAY
- Creating these one-of-a-kind vests has become my obsession!  It is
very rewarding providing this service to our veterans and their four
legged companions.Recently
requests for my vests was increasing dramatically.  The reality is  I
can no longer afford to continue making vests, free of charge, at
this increased rate.
I
started off making 2-3 vests per month
I
am now making 3-4 vests per week!
WITH YOUR HELP - I can continue providing dog vest for vets ""free of charge"" to all our Heroes!I
now have a waiting list of Heroes wanting a vest for their service
dog.  I don't want to disappoint these warriors – but, I need your
help with the funding.
What I Need & What You GetWHAT I NEED – is to raise enough funding to supply vests to heroes
for at least another year (or more).  That is at an average rate of
2-4 vests per week.  If I exceed our goal it will allow us to perhaps increase production or extend our timeframes.
Your
funds will be used for:



Fabric
	(for the soldiers that no longer have their military uniforms)



Hardware
	(plastic buckles, slides, handles, D-rings)



Webbing



Velcro



Patches



Sewing
	Notions (thread, needles, etc.)



Shipping
	Costs



Labor
	(if I get enough funding, I would like to pay another seamstress to
	help increase production)

Some
of the funds will have to be used to cover the costs of using this
crowdfunding site, they include:



Cost
			of “Perks” - your rewards for making a donation



Fee
			to Indiegogo (9% if I don't meet my goal; 4% if I do meet my goal)



Fee
			to process payments (3%)


WHAT
YOU GET – They are called “perks” – I'm so excited about
my new Logo.  It was designed especially for my Heroes.  In fact, the
dog's name on my Logo is “Hero”.  I had all my warriors help
select his name on my FaceBook page.  

So,
all of my perks are made using my “Hero” logo.  You will love it
–

The
Logo will be placed on stickers, stainless steel military dog tags,
and embroidered patches and given to you for your contribution.

It
is such a wonderful, rewarding feeling to give back to these amazing
heroes.  Your reward is a lot like my reward, with the addition of a
few materialistic items of appreciation.

It was my intention to launch <i>Dancing </i>as an Ebook (done), let it rock along for a few months (done), then crowdfund putting it in a hard copy and/or print-on-demand format, which is what I'm doing here at <b>indiegogo</b>.</p><p>I'm the author, writing under the pen name Richard Russell. I'm an American who's twice lived in Japan and over the past dozen years have traveled back and forth to my between the U.S. and Japan some 20 or so times. Over the course of the 30-year sweep of <i>Dancing Over Kyoto</i> the reader lives the experiences of a student, a teacher, an antiquities dealer, a spouse, an attorney, and a man falling in love, and sometimes done-in by love. <i>Dancing</i>'s novelistic story arc, tales from India and China along with Japan, and a healthy dose of sometimes discomforting-but-true Southern Gothic, all contribute to its unique place among ""travel memoirs.""<br/></p><p>While sales (downloads), feedback and customer reviews of <i>Dancing Over Kyoto</i> as an Ebook have been positive (sometimes glowing) to date, bringing it out in hard copy (both in soft cover and hard cover) will help it expand its audience and readership tremendously. <br/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><h3>Bringing <i>Dancing </i>to Print: Funding &amp; Perks<br/>
</h3><p>I'd like to raise at least $3,500 to bring <i>Dancing to Kyoto</i> to print by February 14, Valentine's Day, 2014. The schedule is a tight one:  raising the funds needed to expand <i>Dancing </i>with a glossary and Japanese language primer, pay for formatting, final edits, printing, promotion and have it ready to its hard copy launch date is an ambitious one, but it's doable. Of course the lion's share of the costs go to formatting, edit double-checks, printing set-up, and purchasing (even at a discount) hard copies for promotional purposes. Also, I'm negotiating a contract to have <i>Dancing </i>available as a print-on-demand book available at and through 30,000 book stores and online retailers worldwide such as Barnes &amp; Noble, Amazon.com, etc.  <br/></p><p>Before proceeding to Perks, I want to share what one Deep South author, columnist and radio host, <a href=""http://www.carrolldaleshort.com/MusicFromHome.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Carroll Dale Short</a>, has written about <i>Dancing </i>over at its Ebook site<b>:</b></p><p><b><i> </i></b></p><p>
</p><p><b><i>
  ""'Dancing Over Kyoto' is ostensibly a memoir and travelogue, but it's 
far more than the sum of its parts: engaging and moving, with moments of
 laugh-out-loud humor. What most sets the writing apart, especially in 
today's literary/pop culture of style over substance, is its total lack 
of artifice. The tone is of a casual conversation with the reader, but 
the narrative lingers in the mind and heart long after one has finished 
it.""

It was my intention to launch Dancing as an Ebook (done), let it rock along for a few months (done), then crowdfund putting it in a hard copy and/or print-on-demand format, which is what I'm doing here at indiegogo.I'm the author, writing under the pen name Richard Russell. I'm an American who's twice lived in Japan and over the past dozen years have traveled back and forth to my between the U.S. and Japan some 20 or so times. Over the course of the 30-year sweep of Dancing Over Kyoto the reader lives the experiences of a student, a teacher, an antiquities dealer, a spouse, an attorney, and a man falling in love, and sometimes done-in by love. Dancing's novelistic story arc, tales from India and China along with Japan, and a healthy dose of sometimes discomforting-but-true Southern Gothic, all contribute to its unique place among ""travel memoirs.""While sales (downloads), feedback and customer reviews of Dancing Over Kyoto as an Ebook have been positive (sometimes glowing) to date, bringing it out in hard copy (both in soft cover and hard cover) will help it expand its audience and readership tremendously. Bringing Dancing to Print: Funding & Perks
I'd like to raise at least $3,500 to bring Dancing to Kyoto to print by February 14, Valentine's Day, 2014. The schedule is a tight one:  raising the funds needed to expand Dancing with a glossary and Japanese language primer, pay for formatting, final edits, printing, promotion and have it ready to its hard copy launch date is an ambitious one, but it's doable. Of course the lion's share of the costs go to formatting, edit double-checks, printing set-up, and purchasing (even at a discount) hard copies for promotional purposes. Also, I'm negotiating a contract to have Dancing available as a print-on-demand book available at and through 30,000 book stores and online retailers worldwide such as Barnes & Noble, Amazon.com, etc.  Before proceeding to Perks, I want to share what one Deep South author, columnist and radio host, Carroll Dale Short, has written about Dancing over at its Ebook site: 

  ""'Dancing Over Kyoto' is ostensibly a memoir and travelogue, but it's 
far more than the sum of its parts: engaging and moving, with moments of
 laugh-out-loud humor. What most sets the writing apart, especially in 
today's literary/pop culture of style over substance, is its total lack 
of artifice. The tone is of a casual conversation with the reader, but 
the narrative lingers in the mind and heart long after one has finished 
it.""

Now I want to bring this book to a wider audience, but need your help to do so!PERKS!Any contribution will be appreciated and valued. Here are several specific Perks, which will be sent to crowdfunders within thirty (30) days of Dancing Over Kyoto's availability in hard copy form (remember:  it's already available as an Ebook here.)$10:  A signed cover art photo Bookmark (that's a Noh mask, photographed by the author in Kyoto in 2003) & cover art photo post card mailed to you with a personalized note of thanks from the author. Also, if desired and requested, your name featured on Dancing's website as a valued contributor to bringing Dancing Over Kyoto to hard copy format.$50  All of the above, plus, if desired and requested, an Acknowledgement in the hard copy edition of Dancing Over Kyoto, plus an (approx) 8""x11"" photograph of the cover art photo, suitable for framing and signed by the author. $100 All of the above, plus, for the first 20 $100 contributors, a BookStub (a plastic, credit card-size card) allowing the holder a free download of Dancing as an Ebook, which the holder's free to keep, use, or give as a gift as they may please, plus, a second(approx) 11x8"" photograph taken by the author and suitable for framing:  The Stone Buddha of Kurodani Temple (Kyoto, Japan. 2003). See here:$500 All of the above (excepting the BookStub), plus, -- for the first eight (8) $500-$749 contributors -- a softcover edition of Dancing Over Kyoto signed by the author. $750+ All of the above (excepting the BookStub), plus, a piece of antique Japanese Imari porcelain, acquired by the author in Japan (retail value of each piece, $50-$75.00). This last perk must be limited to five (5) contributors of $750 or more.

<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> “The Aunties: Taking the Planet Back”</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> <b>is brand new way of trying to communicate</b> with everyday people as well as with those in power around this world in time to avert the multiple, potentially irreversible environmental crises we have created and seem to long to ignore.  </span><br/></p>
<p>In the form of an international, interactive, digital magazine/radio podcast <b>""The Aunties"" is a call to action</b> <b>to Aunties, Mothers and Grandmothers around the world to use their power, intelligence, wisdom, attitude and humor</b> <b>to act defiantly to “take the planet back” from the brink of an unprecedented resource crisis</b>.  I hope this magazine/radio podcast will become a go to place for everyone that cares but is confused about what is going on or what to do about it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Inspired by Ancient Greek myths, in each quarterly Issue our protagonists, <i>Auntie Sophia</i>, <i>Auntie Hestia</i>, <i>Auntie Justice</i>, <i>Auntie Lysistrata (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysistrata"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysistrata</a>)</i>, <i>Auntie Artemis</i> and <i>her Amazons</i>,  and <i>Auntie Aphrodite</i> will encourage both men and women in our audience to examine each story holistically (journalism, justice, economy, human rights, security, politics, psychology, education) in order both to understand as well as overcome inevitable disempowering emotions such as frustration, fear, guilt and, potentially, despair. <i>Auntie Sophia</i> will provide background news and other materials on each topic but also ideas for news media/internet articles to be submitted to major outlets.<i> Auntie Justice</i> will have a mock trial on each Issue with pro and con arguments and an interactive jury. In her 'Kitchen Therapy Sessions' <i>Auntie Hestia </i>will be hosting online discussions on our emotional reactions to what were have been reading and listening. A major focus of the 'Department of Economics' of our <i>Gaia School for Girls</i> will be to examine the detrimental economic effects of our continuing inaction and the positive economic effects (as well as challenges) of a positive change of direction to the current course we are on.</p>
<p><b>Our goal is to inspire us all to find our own ways to take action where it most often really hurts these days; in the financial returns, in the ratings, in the voting booth and...in bed =)</b></p>
<p> By following the story carefully narrated by each Auntie <b>our audience will become</b> <b>more informed, empowered and thus, we believe, more active citizens</b> (asking the right questions, choosing the right representatives, making informed consumer decisions). <br/></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My name is Athena. I grew up in Athens, Greece in the 60's in a house with a garden and lemon trees right at the very start of the introduction and subsequent reign of grey apartment buildings, plastic, cement, chlorine and pesticides as unequivocal signs of modernity and development. Our pristine blue beaches got littered with plastic bags and residue from oil spills and some of our rivers turned grey during my parents watch. I joined Greenpeace boats in the early 90's initially more out of gut instinct than out of scientific awareness. I got mesmerized by the spirit of our internationalism. I bowed to the beauty and courage of everyday people we met standing up for wild nature in the smallest/most remote places around this world far away from the safety of the cameras of international mainstream media.  I fell deeply in love with the immense and humbling glory of the sea during a 4-8 am watch crossing the Pacific on the S/V Rainbow Warrior. I prayed to its fury during a terrifying storm in the Gulf of Mexico on the M/V Moby Dick.  I have almost cried at the unrelenting, unfathomable destruction of the breathless magical beauty of this planet of ours. I have tried but cannot yet give up fighting against the utter injustice of this fact. </span><br/></p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We wish to present this idea to 4-5 carefully selected potential strategic partners internationally to discuss collaborating with them in order to run a two-year trial period of 'The Aunties'. We want to be perfectly prepared to walk into such high powered meetings. In order to do that we are going to need a strong Demo Issue, a clear proposal, and the capacity to go wherever they might need us to meet. We have decided to title our Demo/Pilot Issue <b>""Fishy Biznis"" </b>and to focus it on the story of Overfishing from West Africa to the EU and its social, economic and political ramifications both in West Africa and the EU (fisheries depletion, poverty, urgent immigration).</p>The money we raise from donors like you will go towards developing four components:<p></p>
<p>- Paying a team of webdesigners/developers to design this Demo Issue -Designing a c<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ampaign strategy (what is to be achieved, how) - Designing a b</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">usiness plan (how much it will cost, how I get the money, how I manage it)  - Designing a f</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">undraising plan (how I approach the people I should, preparation for proposals to pitch their interest) </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">- Traveling costs to meet potential collaborators. </span></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>One very wise thing that my time at sea taught me was that even if you go to great lengths to carefully chart a destination, pick the best crew available, prepare your boat from top to bottom, stock it up with all necessary supplies and carefully study the weather ahead, once you're out there, after you wave at everybody goodbye on the quayside, you can absolutely never know what the sea or the sky will bring. All you can do is be alert, prepared, stay safe and carefully adjust your course accordingly. I am not going to lie, there are lots of risks as well as challenges along the way, but rest assured that I will do my best to make the best out of all that comes our way! And will be keeping you alerted on any developments.<p></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary

 “The Aunties: Taking the Planet Back” is brand new way of trying to communicate with everyday people as well as with those in power around this world in time to avert the multiple, potentially irreversible environmental crises we have created and seem to long to ignore.  
In the form of an international, interactive, digital magazine/radio podcast ""The Aunties"" is a call to action to Aunties, Mothers and Grandmothers around the world to use their power, intelligence, wisdom, attitude and humor to act defiantly to “take the planet back” from the brink of an unprecedented resource crisis.  I hope this magazine/radio podcast will become a go to place for everyone that cares but is confused about what is going on or what to do about it.

Inspired by Ancient Greek myths, in each quarterly Issue our protagonists, Auntie Sophia, Auntie Hestia, Auntie Justice, Auntie Lysistrata (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysistrata), Auntie Artemis and her Amazons,  and Auntie Aphrodite will encourage both men and women in our audience to examine each story holistically (journalism, justice, economy, human rights, security, politics, psychology, education) in order both to understand as well as overcome inevitable disempowering emotions such as frustration, fear, guilt and, potentially, despair. Auntie Sophia will provide background news and other materials on each topic but also ideas for news media/internet articles to be submitted to major outlets. Auntie Justice will have a mock trial on each Issue with pro and con arguments and an interactive jury. In her 'Kitchen Therapy Sessions' Auntie Hestia will be hosting online discussions on our emotional reactions to what were have been reading and listening. A major focus of the 'Department of Economics' of our Gaia School for Girls will be to examine the detrimental economic effects of our continuing inaction and the positive economic effects (as well as challenges) of a positive change of direction to the current course we are on.
Our goal is to inspire us all to find our own ways to take action where it most often really hurts these days; in the financial returns, in the ratings, in the voting booth and...in bed =)
 By following the story carefully narrated by each Auntie our audience will become more informed, empowered and thus, we believe, more active citizens (asking the right questions, choosing the right representatives, making informed consumer decisions). 


Who am I? 

My name is Athena. I grew up in Athens, Greece in the 60's in a house with a garden and lemon trees right at the very start of the introduction and subsequent reign of grey apartment buildings, plastic, cement, chlorine and pesticides as unequivocal signs of modernity and development. Our pristine blue beaches got littered with plastic bags and residue from oil spills and some of our rivers turned grey during my parents watch. I joined Greenpeace boats in the early 90's initially more out of gut instinct than out of scientific awareness. I got mesmerized by the spirit of our internationalism. I bowed to the beauty and courage of everyday people we met standing up for wild nature in the smallest/most remote places around this world far away from the safety of the cameras of international mainstream media.  I fell deeply in love with the immense and humbling glory of the sea during a 4-8 am watch crossing the Pacific on the S/V Rainbow Warrior. I prayed to its fury during a terrifying storm in the Gulf of Mexico on the M/V Moby Dick.  I have almost cried at the unrelenting, unfathomable destruction of the breathless magical beauty of this planet of ours. I have tried but cannot yet give up fighting against the utter injustice of this fact. 








Ways You Can Help
This project has been a labour of passion and love but will only succeed because of the passion and love of people like you around this world. If you are moved by this message and wish to help bring The Aunties to life, please share this page with other people you think it would resonate with and, if you are able, donate as generously as you possibly can. 
Also, do feel free to bless the potential power of The Aunties in any way you see fit, especially if you live anywhere close to a river or the sea! 







What We Need 
We wish to present this idea to 4-5 carefully selected potential strategic partners internationally to discuss collaborating with them in order to run a two-year trial period of 'The Aunties'. We want to be perfectly prepared to walk into such high powered meetings. In order to do that we are going to need a strong Demo Issue, a clear proposal, and the capacity to go wherever they might need us to meet. We have decided to title our Demo/Pilot Issue ""Fishy Biznis"" and to focus it on the story of Overfishing from West Africa to the EU and its social, economic and political ramifications both in West Africa and the EU (fisheries depletion, poverty, urgent immigration).The money we raise from donors like you will go towards developing four components:
- Paying a team of webdesigners/developers to design this Demo Issue -Designing a campaign strategy (what is to be achieved, how) - Designing a business plan (how much it will cost, how I get the money, how I manage it)  - Designing a fundraising plan (how I approach the people I should, preparation for proposals to pitch their interest) - Traveling costs to meet potential collaborators. 








What You Get
Our serious gratitude for believing in the potential of this project PLUS, if you so choose, one of our especially designed unique perks listed on the right side of this page



















Risks & Challenges
One very wise thing that my time at sea taught me was that even if you go to great lengths to carefully chart a destination, pick the best crew available, prepare your boat from top to bottom, stock it up with all necessary supplies and carefully study the weather ahead, once you're out there, after you wave at everybody goodbye on the quayside, you can absolutely never know what the sea or the sky will bring. All you can do is be alert, prepared, stay safe and carefully adjust your course accordingly. I am not going to lie, there are lots of risks as well as challenges along the way, but rest assured that I will do my best to make the best out of all that comes our way! And will be keeping you alerted on any developments.





What I think is going on?

Worrying signs abound yet governments, business leaders and mainstream media seem unable to take the necessary steps, in the necessary timeframe, to avert grave environmental threats which do not bode well either for us or for future generations. The scientific community has been raising the alarm. So have renowned economists, politicians, journalists, security experts and responsible members of the private sector. Why are we not listening?


A realization that had been developing in me since my days as a deckhand on Greenpeace boats was that we were living in a world of two ‘planets.’ 

* ‘Planet A’ consisted of Governments, Business, Mainstream Media and NGO’s. *‘Planet B’ consisted of ‘everybody else’. ‘Planet A’ seemed to love referring to ‘Planet B’, yet no one seemed to ever actually seriously want to engage with them. My ‘aha’ moment came in 2009 after the failure of the UN Copenhagen Climate Talks'. The planet was dying and I was tired of waiting. 

With the now obvious links between environmental degradation and the economy, immigration, health, human rights being consistently ignored by those in power my passion shifted away from merely trying to engage them and instead moved towards conversing with and mobilizing those far from the 'centers of power'. 





Why The Aunties? 


“The Aunties: Taking the Planet Back” is an idea born of this wish to engage with and empower everyday men and women around the globe to create a constructive and creative bridge between these two Planets in time to avert the consequences of climate change and resource depletion.
Why Aunties? Even though we are all, men and women, young and old, fighting against and all to blame for where we stand in the world today, in every port I have sailed to, in every village or town I have visited or worked in around this world I kept, and keep, being struck by the knowledge,  wisdom, quiet power and defiant attitude of women with a wrinkle or two who seem to possess an almost instinctive sense of guardianship both for their families as well as for the  planet around them. Women from all walks of life, who hold a lot of power amongst all generations of their families and workplaces to change things yet seem to have hardly ever been the targets of any serious communication campaigns except those that sold them anti-wrinkle creams, pick-me-up brassieres and household products. I had met and laughed with these women all over this planet. To me, in their collective power, they felt like a sleeping giant. I decided it was them I wanted to honor first.
""The Aunties: Taking the Planet Back"" is a magazine inspired by Aunties, Mothers and Grandmothers around this world who understand something is very wrong with the planet and its environment, who are keen for someone to explain, in understandable terms, why, who are tired of feeling scared and helpless, and who wish to use their brains, humor and wisdom to try to do something together to get us out of this mess. 
In defiant celebration of the richness and depth of slow journalism and respect for the seriousness of a crisis which cannot be comprehended or solved with a few sound bites, each issue will only cover one international story and take three months to unfold. 











The Impact
The Aunties will be focusing their first two years of operation on two main story lines:* Climate change and climate justice.* Fisheries/Resource Depletion.


Each Issue will be highlighting a vision of a New Economy that, if followed, could solve the issues at hand whilst creating new/more jobs.

Pour cela, notre architecte, Angel Martínez, du Cabinet d'Architecture Amalur, à Valencia, est en train de constituer toute la documentation nécessaire à cette légalisation urbanistique.Les documents concernés sont de deux types:A. Une INFORMATION PRELIMINAIRE, qui devra passer par le Cabinet d'Architectes et soumise à l'approbation de la Mairie de Requena et au Conseil d'Urbanisme de la  Région de Valencia.B. Une fois l'information approuvée, on passera à l'élaboration de la PROCEDURE DE LEGALISATION, qui doit  être visée par le Cabinet d'Architectes et approuvée par la Mairie de Requena.PREBUDGETLe coût total de cette mise aux normes est le suivant:Architecte + Cabinet d'Architectes: 19.800 €Coût Licence Municipale: 13.000 €Impact environnemental: 1.280 €Certification des installations électriques: 3.000€Modifications nécessaires:1.000€TOTAL: 47.080 €Actuellement, la Communauté ne peut pas faire face à ces dépenses sans mettre en péril le fonctionnement normal et quotidien du Monastère. Nous demandons donc l'aide de toutes les personnes qui participent ou approuvent le  travail spirituel et de développement personnel se réalisant au Monastère Luz Serena. A ce jour nous avons réussi, grâce aux membres directs de la Communauté Bouddhiste Soto Zen et à d'autres personnes amies ou proches, à réunir la somme de 21.467 €, réalisant ainsi un grand effort de collecte de fonds. Mais il nous manque encore  environ 16.000 € pour financer le budget total de notre objectif.L'Association Zen d'Alicante se propose d'aider cette campagne afin de collecter le plus possible de fonds permettant de continuer de supporter le travail du Monastère Luz Serena. Nous avons choisi d'utiliser la plateforme de Crowdfunding Projeggt pour lancer notre campagne car elle a une modalité “Tout compte” assurant que tous les dons réalisés soient destinés à ce projet, même si l'objectif final de 16.000 € n'est pas atteint.Nous  faisons appel à la générosité de tous ceux qui peuvent réaliser un don grâce à l'un des formats d'aide que nous proposons ainsi qu'à votre soutien à la diffusion de cette action afin de réunir le maximum de personnes sympathisantes.Avec tous nos remerciements.En gasshô, L'Association Zen d'Alicante--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- El Monestir Zen “Luz Serena” és la seu espiritual i administrativa de la Comunitat Budista Soto Zen. Està situat en una propietat de 33 Ha de boscos de pins, en una zona de valls sinuoses, entre la província de València i Albacete , a 5 Km del Riu Cabriel.El Monestir ha entrat en procés de legalització urbanística. Això requereix preparar i adequar les condicions necessàries d'habitabilitat per acollir amb seguretat totes les persones que participen en les diferents activitats que es realitzen, ja siga com a residents al monestir, participants en recessos zen o practicants d'altres tradicions espirituals o tècniques terapèutiques que ens vulguen freqüentar com un lloc de trobada, treball personal, pau i interiorització.El Monestir actual va començar fa 25 anys amb més il·lusió i esperança que recursos i instal·lacions adequades. En condicions precàries, el dojo de meditació era una carpa de lona plàstica de segona mà. La pràctica del Dharma i la direcció espiritual de l'abat del Monestir, el mestre Dokushô Villalba, suplia aquestes dificultats materials inicials. No obstant això, facilitar l'acostament de tots a la Via del Dharma ha sigut una prioritat que aquesta Comunitat ha sostingut i procurat i, per això , aquests anys s'ha estat lluitant amb les limitacions pròpies de l’enclavament natural, un bell paratge protegit però mancat de regulació urbanística municipal.Fa uns mesos, va ser aprovat de forma definitiva el nou Pla General d'Ordenació Urbana de Requena, norma en la qual ha estat requalificada la zona de terreny propietat de la Comunitat Budista Soto Zen on s'assenta el monestir com ""d'ús religiós i de serveis"". Això ens obliga a iniciar el procés d'adequació legal que ens marca aquest nou ordenament local aprovat. Per això, el nostre arquitecte, Ángel Martínez, de l'Estudi d'Arquitectura Amalur , a València, ja està elaborant la documentació necessària per a aquesta legalització urbanística.Aquests documents són de dos tipus :A. Un INFORME PREVI, que haurà de passar pel Col·legi d'Arquitectes i que, també, haurà de ser sotmés a aprovació per l'Ajuntament de Requena i la Conselleria d'Urbanisme de la Generalitat Valenciana.B. Una vegada que l'informe estiga aprovat, s’elaborarà l’EXPEDIENT DE LEGALITZACIÓ, que ha de ser visat pel Col·legi d'Arquitectes i aprovat per l'Ajuntament de RequenaPRESSUPOST El cost total d'aquest procés normatiu és el següent : Arquitecte + Col·legi: 19.800 € Import Llicència Municipal : 13.000 € Impacte paisatgístic : 1.280 € Certificació instal·lacions elèctrica : 3.000 € Reformes necessàries: 1.000 € TOTAL : 38.080 €Actualment, la Comunitat no pot fer front a aquesta despesa sense posar en perill el funcionament normal i quotidià del monestir. Necessitem, doncs, l'ajuda de totes aquelles persones que simpatitzen i s'identifiquen amb la tasca espiritual i de creixement personal que es realitza al Monestir Luz Serena. Actualment, els membres directes de la Comunitat Budista Soto Zen i altres persones amigues i properes hem aconseguit reunir 21.467€ realitzant un gran esforç de recaptació. Però, encara, ens falten al voltant d’uns 16.000 € per a aconseguir sufragar el pressupost total del nostre objectiu.Des de l'Associació Zen d'Alacant ens proposem impulsar aquesta campanya per recollir la major quantitat possible de fons per continuar donant suport a la tasca del Monestir Luz Serena. Hem triat la plataforma de Crowdfunding per llançar la nostra campanya perquè té una modalitat ""TOT COMPTE"" que ens assegura que totes les donacions realitzades seran destinades a aquest projecte encara que no arribem a l'objectiu final de 16.000 €.Necessitem la generositat d'aquells que puguen realitzar alguna donació en algun dels formats d'ajuda que proposem i, també, del vostre suport en la difusió d'aquesta acció perquè trobe al major nombre de persones simpatitzants possible .Moltes gràcies .en gasshôAssociació Zen d'Alacant",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>Domande ricorrenti (FAQ)</b></p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p><i>A chi sto donando i
miei soldi?</i></p>
<p>Stai donando la tua quota a Carlo Andrea Tortorelli; non
sono un associazione, ma un privato cittadino che coltiva un vivo interesse per
il mondo del trasporto pubblico. Per celebrare il centenario della
Roma-Giardinetti ho deciso privamente di impegnarmi nella produzione di gadget
a ricordo della storica data. L'assicurazione della mia serietà è nel mio blog
<a href=""http://tramromagiardinetti.blogspot.it/p/eventi-passati.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sferragliamenti dalla Casilina</a>, nel quale trovate traccia degli eventi che ho
già fatto in passato.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>Perchè ti servono 700
euro?</i></p>
<p>Per si tratta dell'ammontare minimo necessario per rendere
possibile la produzione dei gadget. La cifra non include solo i costi
materiali, ma anche la somma per ingaggiare un grafico professionista ed
eventuali spese amministrative.L'unico ritorno che ho è l'onore di poter contribuire
attivamente alle celebrazioni del centenario del trenino Roma-Giardinetti. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<b>
</b><p><i>Non riesco a donare e/o ad accedere all'acquisto dei gadget: come faccio?</i></p>
<p>Ecco a te la procedura guidata!</p>
<p>La prima cosa è andare sul link:<br/><a href=""http://www.igg.me/at/CENTO"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.igg.me/at/CENTO</a><br/>Nella prima pagina si può ascoltare l'appello video di Carlo Andrea, leggere la storia della ferrovia, conoscere le motivazioni per le quali si vuole celebrare il centenario. Se si condividono le motivazioni e si vuol dare un sostegno concreto allora si clicca su ""Contribute now"". Così di accede alla prima fase:<br/>1- Contribute - In questa fase posso scegliere se avere il regalo finale (""Add Perk"") e allora devo per forza attenermi alle cifre di 2, 5, 7, 10 e 20 euro e inserire i dati di e-mail, oppure posso scegliere di non avere il regalo (""No Perk"") e quindi la mia offerta diventa libera (da 1 euro all'infinito...). Per facilitare l'acquisto dei gadget nella pagina principale sono inseriti dei banner che mi consentono donare avendo già nel carrello il ricordo desiderato: dovrò comunque controllare che il sistema abbia inserito correttamente ciò che intendo acquistare.<br/>Con ""Contact Information"" posso scegliere di identificarmi tramite Facebook (per chi lo ha) oppure inserire la mia e-mail.<br/>Dopo la scelta di quanto contribuire si passa quindi alla seconda fase:<br/>2 - Pay - clicco su ""Go to Pay Pal"" e mi appare una schermata dove mi si dà la possibilità di scegliere se pagare con Pay Pal (se io ho una carta di credito associata a un conto Pay Pal) oppure con una qualsiasi carta di credito. In questo secondo caso, che penso sia per la maggioranza di noi, cliccandoci sopra mi chiede, lo stato, la lingua (e qui le cose diventano più facili dato che posso scegliere l'italiano) e i dati della carta (numero, data scadenza, numero segreto...). Un'unica accortezza: togliete la spunta sulla casella che dice ""Salva questi dati su un conto Pay Pal"".<br/>Così abbiamo completato l'operazione con la terza fase:<br/>3 - Share - posso vedere il mio contributo che appare tra i ""Funders""</p>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p><i>Temo che la piattaforma non sia sicura per i pagamenti online: ci sono alternative di pagamento?</i></p>
<p>No, la campagna Indiegogo è l'unica modalità con la quale puoi acquistare i gadget. Per fugare tutti i dubbi, ti assicuro che si tratta di un canale<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/per-il-mio-compleanno-per-il-mio-futuro/x/10415985#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> già testato con successo in altri contesti</a> e perciò l'ho scelto a ragion veduta.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>In che modalità
verranno consegnati i gadget?</i></p>
<p>I gadget saranno consegnati il 12 giugno 2016
all'appuntamento a piazza della Camelie (Gruppo A - 9:30 / Gruppo B - 10:45 /
Gruppo C - 12:00). Nel caso non si possa essere presenti all'appuntamento
previsto, ci sarà un'ulteriore data di ritiro che verrà definita
successivamente all'evento.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i>Comprando i gadget
sono in diritto di viaggiare gratuitamente sul trenino?</i></p>
<p>No, il prezzo dei diversi gadget è stato studiato per
coprire esclusivamente il costo di produzione degli stessi. Pertanto per
partecipare a uno dei tour dei Gruppi A, B, C bisognerà necessariamente essere muniti
di regolare titolo di viaggio, secondo quanto prescritto dalle Condizioni
Generali di Trasporto dell’Atac. Il reperimento e il costo del titolo di
viaggio è a carico del singolo.<br/></p>

I ricordi
Come complemento al tour, saranno
disponibili dei gadget che verranno prodotti solo in questa particolarissima
occasione. Per procedere con l’acquisto bisognerà donare la quota
corrispettiva, avendo ben cura di
controllare che nel carrello ci sia il perk desiderato.NOTA BENE: Non è possibile effettuare la spedizione postale dei gadget, che potranno essere ritirati solo il 12 giugno o in un'ulteriore data che verrà definita successivamente all'evento.L'evento e la raccolta fondi sono organizzati in Media Partnership con la Gazzetta dei Trasporti - IlPendolare Magazine e con la fondazione Ferrovia-Museo della Stazione di Colonna.

La Roma –Fiuggi non è stata  solo un servizio utile ai cittadini del
Lazio, ma anche un elemento caratterizzante della storia dei paesi e delle vite
che ha attraversato.

Domande ricorrenti (FAQ)


A chi sto donando i
miei soldi?
Stai donando la tua quota a Carlo Andrea Tortorelli; non
sono un associazione, ma un privato cittadino che coltiva un vivo interesse per
il mondo del trasporto pubblico. Per celebrare il centenario della
Roma-Giardinetti ho deciso privamente di impegnarmi nella produzione di gadget
a ricordo della storica data. L'assicurazione della mia serietà è nel mio blog
Sferragliamenti dalla Casilina, nel quale trovate traccia degli eventi che ho
già fatto in passato.



Perchè ti servono 700
euro?
Per si tratta dell'ammontare minimo necessario per rendere
possibile la produzione dei gadget. La cifra non include solo i costi
materiali, ma anche la somma per ingaggiare un grafico professionista ed
eventuali spese amministrative.L'unico ritorno che ho è l'onore di poter contribuire
attivamente alle celebrazioni del centenario del trenino Roma-Giardinetti. 


Non riesco a donare e/o ad accedere all'acquisto dei gadget: come faccio?
Ecco a te la procedura guidata!
La prima cosa è andare sul link:www.igg.me/at/CENTONella prima pagina si può ascoltare l'appello video di Carlo Andrea, leggere la storia della ferrovia, conoscere le motivazioni per le quali si vuole celebrare il centenario. Se si condividono le motivazioni e si vuol dare un sostegno concreto allora si clicca su ""Contribute now"". Così di accede alla prima fase:1- Contribute - In questa fase posso scegliere se avere il regalo finale (""Add Perk"") e allora devo per forza attenermi alle cifre di 2, 5, 7, 10 e 20 euro e inserire i dati di e-mail, oppure posso scegliere di non avere il regalo (""No Perk"") e quindi la mia offerta diventa libera (da 1 euro all'infinito...). Per facilitare l'acquisto dei gadget nella pagina principale sono inseriti dei banner che mi consentono donare avendo già nel carrello il ricordo desiderato: dovrò comunque controllare che il sistema abbia inserito correttamente ciò che intendo acquistare.Con ""Contact Information"" posso scegliere di identificarmi tramite Facebook (per chi lo ha) oppure inserire la mia e-mail.Dopo la scelta di quanto contribuire si passa quindi alla seconda fase:2 - Pay - clicco su ""Go to Pay Pal"" e mi appare una schermata dove mi si dà la possibilità di scegliere se pagare con Pay Pal (se io ho una carta di credito associata a un conto Pay Pal) oppure con una qualsiasi carta di credito. In questo secondo caso, che penso sia per la maggioranza di noi, cliccandoci sopra mi chiede, lo stato, la lingua (e qui le cose diventano più facili dato che posso scegliere l'italiano) e i dati della carta (numero, data scadenza, numero segreto...). Un'unica accortezza: togliete la spunta sulla casella che dice ""Salva questi dati su un conto Pay Pal"".Così abbiamo completato l'operazione con la terza fase:3 - Share - posso vedere il mio contributo che appare tra i ""Funders""

Temo che la piattaforma non sia sicura per i pagamenti online: ci sono alternative di pagamento?
No, la campagna Indiegogo è l'unica modalità con la quale puoi acquistare i gadget. Per fugare tutti i dubbi, ti assicuro che si tratta di un canale già testato con successo in altri contesti e perciò l'ho scelto a ragion veduta.



In che modalità
verranno consegnati i gadget?
I gadget saranno consegnati il 12 giugno 2016
all'appuntamento a piazza della Camelie (Gruppo A - 9:30 / Gruppo B - 10:45 /
Gruppo C - 12:00). Nel caso non si possa essere presenti all'appuntamento
previsto, ci sarà un'ulteriore data di ritiro che verrà definita
successivamente all'evento.

Comprando i gadget
sono in diritto di viaggiare gratuitamente sul trenino?
No, il prezzo dei diversi gadget è stato studiato per
coprire esclusivamente il costo di produzione degli stessi. Pertanto per
partecipare a uno dei tour dei Gruppi A, B, C bisognerà necessariamente essere muniti
di regolare titolo di viaggio, secondo quanto prescritto dalle Condizioni
Generali di Trasporto dell’Atac. Il reperimento e il costo del titolo di
viaggio è a carico del singolo.

<h2>Dreams on Distant Shores</h2>
<p>We're Alley Valkyrie and Rhyd Wildermuth, two friends, witches, radicals, and anarchists, and we're going to France together.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>To dream. To write. To create more, to think more, to share more, and to be more.</p>
<p>And we need your help to make this happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Are We Doing?</h3>
<p>To set ourselves up across the Atlantic, we need some financial support. Both of us get support through Patreon and some creative projects, but to gain eventual residency in France we'll need enough money to prove that we do not need to work within the country. This fundraiser isn't meant to get us to that point, but to provide seed money to act as a foundation from which we can build our future plans. </p>
<p>We're entering on tourist visas while pursuing our individual long-term strategies. While there, we'll be writing and creating as before (and have so much more time to do so!), but will be prohibited from ""working"" in any form of wage-labor scenario due to visa restrictions. We also both have housing for the duration. And one of us is getting married. :)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are all kinds of risks in what we're doing. With the state of the current US Government, the rise of fascist and nationalist groups in the US and Europe, and with all the other crises in the world, what we're doing is a bold leap.</p>
<p>Because we will not be allowed to work in France, our only incomes will be support from our readers and sponsors, and our writing and art projects. </p>
<p>And though we have friends in France, we'll be away from our base communities and will need to rely much more on ourselves and each other.</p>
<p>Despite all that? We're <strong><i>excited. </i></strong>And quite confident that what we're doing is the right thing, not just for ourselves but for you, those who are inspired by our work. We'll have more time, more freedom, and will be in a place that makes us much happier and healthier. Likewise, we'll have more experiences that will spark new ideas and we will meet new people whose stories and work will inspire new dreams, new perspectives, new writing, and new art.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We've set up this fundraiser to supplement the other ways that our readers and sponsors support us. We're both also on Patreon and greatly appreciate your recurring support there. This is especially recommended for those who would rather give over a period of time, rather than a one-time donation--and you get cool stuff. :)</p>

<h3>I launched Reel Honey (reelhoney.com) in April of 2017 to give young women and non-binary writers a platform to discover and develop their capacity for cultural criticism.</h3>
<p>I was frustrated by how writing for free is largely the norm in the world of entry-level culture writing, and I wondered what would happen if there were a <i>paying </i>site that was fun to write for, inclusive, and accessible regardless of prior writing experience. I raised enough money privately to be able to pay every writer $15 per piece for at least a year. Pretty measly, right? But it was a place to start, especially since I had no idea how the project would be received, and couldn’t be certain that it would still exist a year later.</p>
<p>Well, a year and a half later, the site has published the writing of more than 51 different young people. We publish written pieces weekly throughout the year, along with a quarterly themed issue. Our contributors have used their involvement with the project to apply to graduate programs and to secure full-time writing positions elsewhere. They’ve been diverse with respect to age, occupation, gender identity, sexuality, racial and ethnic identity, ability, religion, and geographical location. We’ve collaborated with Canadian universities to recruit new voices and to help demystify the world of cultural criticism and journalism.</p>
<p>The issue is that I’m still only able to pay contributors $15 per piece, and that rate is far more inappropriate now that we’ve accomplished all of the above. I’d love to be able to triple it at the very least, but I can’t do that without some help. Please consider contributing to our campaign if you’d like to keep us independent and ad-free (and able to cover our monthly hosting costs), if you believe in paying young writers and illustrators adequately for their labour, and if you’d like to help us move the needle for young women and non-binary folks in professional culture writing. </p>

<p><strong>EAT 360 - Emotional Awareness Training - 360° of Nourishment</strong></p>
<p>After building the Wellness Olympiad program for women with eating disorders in 2010, and interviewing <strong>over 20 experts on the Spiritual, Mental, Emotional, and Physical aspects of challenges with food and body</strong>, it was time to zero in on the essentials learned and offer women struggling with emotional eating (not just severe eating disorders) a focused method to break free. I thus invited Johnny Blackburn to join me in this mission. Johnny combines <strong>functional Nutrition, EFT, Integral Life Coaching, and a Master's Degree in Psychology </strong>with clinical experience working in a renowned international Functional Medical Center as well as an integrative Addiction Eating Disorder, and Trauma Center. Together, our experiences, gifts, and understanding have created this new way for women to <strong>get back into the driver's seat of navigating their relationship with food, their body, their emotions, and their mind.</strong></p>

<p>The program involves <strong>a 12 week integration audio session series</strong> and is supported with a <strong>study guide inquiry/exercise process.</strong> It covers all four wings of wellness and how they can make or break our relationship with food:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Mental: </strong>beliefs busters &amp; brain changing technology</li>
<li>
<strong>Physical:</strong> nourishment &amp; self-care: movement food vitality &amp; rhythm</li>
<li>
<strong>Spiritual:</strong> sacredness &amp;, connection </li>
<li>
<strong>Emotions:</strong> EAT process, including EFT for past releasing &amp; present freedom</li>
</ul><p><strong>We also offer optional one-on-one coaching</strong>. This delivers personalized attention and support with additional body/mind aspects such as a 3 month targeted supplement supply and a Brainwave audio entrainment device for mental/nervous system support (created miracles for me!). We believe this to be <strong>the most comprehensive breakthrough system offered yet for emotional eating</strong>, and we need your support to built continue to grow its reach and team so we can deliver it to 1000 women over this next year, and much more beyond.</p>

<p>Staying on top of <strong>web integration platforms</strong> these days takes constant effort and the right team players on board to make it happen. Supporting thousands of women to become free from emotional eating will require us to offer solutions in difference mediums, catering to the different preferences and lifestyles.<br/><strong><em><br/> Women thrive on connection</em></strong> -- so while we will be teaching and advocating for them to foster more face-to-face interaction with their loved ones and in their local communities, we want to offer an exciting community aspect that continues to foster Operation Swimming Out of Water.</p>

After building the Wellness Olympiad program for women with eating disorders in 2010, and interviewing over 20 experts on the Spiritual, Mental, Emotional, and Physical aspects of challenges with food and body, it was time to zero in on the essentials learned and offer women struggling with emotional eating (not just severe eating disorders) a focused method to break free. I thus invited Johnny Blackburn to join me in this mission. Johnny combines functional Nutrition, EFT, Integral Life Coaching, and a Master's Degree in Psychology with clinical experience working in a renowned international Functional Medical Center as well as an integrative Addiction Eating Disorder, and Trauma Center. Together, our experiences, gifts, and understanding have created this new way for women to get back into the driver's seat of navigating their relationship with food, their body, their emotions, and their mind.

The program involves a 12 week integration audio session series and is supported with a study guide inquiry/exercise process. It covers all four wings of wellness and how they can make or break our relationship with food:


Mental: beliefs busters & brain changing technology

Physical: nourishment & self-care: movement food vitality & rhythm

Spiritual: sacredness &, connection 

Emotions: EAT process, including EFT for past releasing & present freedom
We also offer optional one-on-one coaching. This delivers personalized attention and support with additional body/mind aspects such as a 3 month targeted supplement supply and a Brainwave audio entrainment device for mental/nervous system support (created miracles for me!). We believe this to be the most comprehensive breakthrough system offered yet for emotional eating, and we need your support to built continue to grow its reach and team so we can deliver it to 1000 women over this next year, and much more beyond.
 

""Cat's blend of soul and science offers a ray of hope for anyone who's lived in the darkness of disordered eating, as well as the inspiration and tools to break free."" ~ Natasha Schuler, single mom
EAT 360 PHONE APP
This complete health-building program is effective because it gets women to APPLY practices and tools that create real sustainable shifts in their lives. THIS PHONE APP IS ESSENTIAL - it creates a sense of accountability and follow through to aid in the process of transformation with eating. EAT 360 APP will not only be for those participating in the EAT 360 program, we will market it to nutritionists, life coaches, and counselors who know how important it is for their clients to follow a healthy eating regime, and release the emotions that are keeping them stuck in old behaviors. With pre/post-meal prompts, hunger/satiation check-ins, and guided Emotional Freedom Techniques to help free up emotions before eating, this App will help users raise emotional awareness while breaking through unhealthy eating behaviors. This App will be made available for both iPhone and Android applications.

""Catherine shows how freeing and empowering diving into the fullness of our feelings can be, when we learn to fully feel and release our emotions, gaining greater self acceptance, peace, and purpose."" ~ Dale Paula Teplitz, Emotional Freedom Techniques, EFT trainer
Develop/Maintain Community Support and Social Media Integration
Staying on top of web integration platforms these days takes constant effort and the right team players on board to make it happen. Supporting thousands of women to become free from emotional eating will require us to offer solutions in difference mediums, catering to the different preferences and lifestyles. Women thrive on connection -- so while we will be teaching and advocating for them to foster more face-to-face interaction with their loved ones and in their local communities, we want to offer an exciting community aspect that continues to foster Operation Swimming Out of Water.
""Catherine Garceau has turned her amazing accomplishments into even deeper wins, as she has taken on the greatest race of all: the effort to be our own best self."" ~ Marianne Williamson, best-selling author
HELP US FREE 1000 WOMEN of EMOTIONAL EATING IN ONE YEAR
We hear about eating disorders, but severe eating disorders spread across a full spectrum of unhealthy relationships with food and body?  For most women, binge eating, self-loathing, and different versions of emotional eating are still being kept a personal and secret challenge, not spoken about openly and often times, passed on to the next generation.  Operation Swimming Out of Water will give a voice to the millions of women around the world who just like you and me, are successful in some areas of life, but still struggle behind closed doors - cursing their body shapes and sizes, their relationship with food, and/or the workouts they can't keep up with or obsess about. More than creating AWARENESS - we provide SOLUTIONS: My team and I are 100% committed to fulfill on this mission - changing the lives of 1000 women in the next year.

""May Swimming Out of Water awaken young women to the dangers of messing with what they eat and remind us all that our bodies, brain, and mind are so very connected!""  ~ Dr. Daniel Amen, award-winning psychiatrist, brain imaging expert and best-selling author.

<p>My name is Leo McKay Jr. I live in Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada, where I have been a writer and a high school teacher for eighteen years. My 2003 novel, <em>Twenty-six</em>, a fictionalized account of the Westray mine disaster, was a national best seller and in 2010 was chosen through CBC Radio’s Canada Reads as one of the 40 most important Canadian books of the preceding decade.  My short story collection, <em>Like This</em>, was a finalist for the Giller Prize in 1995. I’ve been a literary magazine editor and I’ve written many articles for publications such as The National Post, The Globe and Mail, and the Halifax Chronicle-Herald.</p>
<p><em>Roll Up the Rim</em>, my new novel, is a comic tale of obsession, redemption, divine intervention, and Timbits. Posterity may or may not decide to call <em>Roll Up the Rim</em> The Great Canadian Novel. With its main character employed at Tim Horton’s and obsessed with rolling up the rim to win the prize car he must park his own rusted out Escort beside every morning, <em>Roll Up the Rim</em> is already, even before publication, The Great Canadian Tim Horton’s Novel.</p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign is not just about the book, it is part of a larger story. By fundraising in this way to publish and promote my own creative work, I am one of the first Canadian literary writers with an established record in old school publishing to make the giant step in the direction of going Indie.</p>
<p>You can help make this happen.</p>
<h2><strong>Where the Money Goes</strong></h2>
<p>To make this publishing venture a success, I’m going to need about 8500 dollars in start-up money. The bulk of that total (about 6000 dollars) goes to pay for a professional editing of the manuscript and for a 1200 copy print run of the physical book. On top of these costs, I have to pay Steven Berry, the professional video artist who shot my campaign video, and Ben Brush, who has done artwork and graphic design. Both of these generous souls agreed to do work ahead with their payment contingent upon the success of this campaign.</p>
<p>I also have to pay for set-up costs of an online merchandizing store, for sundry small formatting issues involved with ebook production, for stationery and postage to mail out copies of the book, and for the production and mailout of promotional materials to advertize the book once it’s been produced.</p>
<h2><strong>What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>What you get in return for your contribution to the campaign depends on which level of perks you choose. At the very least, you get a signed copy of the book, and you get it a couple of weeks before it is available to others. You get the ebook if that is the format you prefer, and you get that in advance as well. You get original hand printed artwork by Ben Brush. You get a live Skype reading. You get me, the author, to appear in person for a private reading and discussion. You get your contribution recognized by having your name mentioned on the website. You get your name printed in the pages of the book. One ambitious contributor gets a whole page at the front of the book, under the title of Publisher.</p>
<p>The Roll Up the Rim Indiegogo campaign is called a Fixed Funding campaign. That means that I have 30 days to reach my financial goal. If I reach that goal in 30 days, I get all the money minus the 4% that goes to Indiegogo.com, and the project goes forward. If the goal does not get reached, 100% of the money gets refunded to contributors.</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>The campaign for <em>Roll Up the Rim</em> is important for three reasons.</p>
<p><strong>1. Reflecting the Culture</strong> This new novel is a comic take on a vital aspect of the culture of the Canadian East Coast. Roll Up the Rim is the first work of fiction in Canada to celebrate, explore, explode, and excoriate the weirdly central place that Tim Horton’s plays in the cultural life of this place.</p>
<p>Tim Horton’s plays as big a role in East Coast life as primary industry, celtic music, and the legacy of the Bluenose II, and <em>Roll Up the Rim</em> is the first novel soaking ringing drenched in Tim Horton’s. The main character works in Tim Horton’s and the Roll Up the Rim to Win contest plays a central role in the plot of the book.</p>
<p><strong>2. Making an Artistic Statement</strong> On a personal level, this book is important to me because it is a comic work.  People who know me well are often puzzled by my first two books, telling me: “You’re such a silly, humour-oriented person, but your books are so serious.” I feel I’ve rectified that divide between serious and silly with this book.</p>
<p><strong>3. Going Indie</strong> The final thing that makes this campaign stand out is that it marks my move from the established literary publishing world in Canada (my first book was published by one of the premier small presses in Canada, my second with THE prestige literary publisher) and signals my foray into the realm of being an Indie writer.</p>
<p>The music industry has been transformed through electronic media in the last 15 years, allowing artists to step creatively and entrepreneurially out on their own. This same shift, from massive, centralized vetting and distribution to smaller, de-centralized, independently managed artistic output is just beginning to arrive in the literary world.</p>
<p>I am the first literary writer I personally know of to take this step, but I will not be the last. So few people have done what I’m doing with this book that all of my role models, all of the people I’ve consulted with who’ve made similar moves, have been musicians.</p>
<p>Your support of this campaign will not only help me achieve my goal, it will help blaze a trail for those writers who follow me down this path. We’re at the absolute rock face with this project, and that feels exciting.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>If you are unable to contribute to the campaign with money, please, spread the word. Share the link to this page on Facebook. Tweet it on Twitter. Post it on your blog. Email your peeps. Talk to people. Online funding depends on networks of interconnected humans. Please help this campaign by bringing it to the attention of others who may be interested in helping.</p>

<p style="""">For the past few years I've been writing articles about LGBT concepts and creating queer-positive edugraphics on my website, <a href=""http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">It's Pronounced Metrosexual</a>. Maybe you're familiar with this one:</p>

<p style="""">Well, I wrote a book! It's a guide to gender, from a social justice perspective. It's a couple hundred pages of gender exploration, social justice how-tos, and fun graphics &amp; comics. </p>
<p style="""">It offers clear, easily-digested, and practical explanations of one of the most commonly misunderstood things about people: gender.</p>
<p style="""">It's not just about the <a href=""http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/what-does-the-asterisk-in-trans-stand-for/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">trans*</a> or transgender understanding of gender, though that is certainly a component. It's about gender itself, all-encompassingly, from a socially just and non-binary slant.</p>

<h2 style="""">""Why are you crowdsourcing?""</h2>
<p style="""">A couple publishers reached out to me to publish this book. There was only one area where we couldn't come to an agreement: I was insistent upon offering a free version through my website and they were insistent that I don't.</p>
<p style="""">It's incredibly important to me that I am able to offer a free electronic copy of this book. Access is one my key values as a social justice advocate, and I don't want even a small fee to stand in the way of someone getting this book and the education it provides.</p>
<h3 style=""""><strong>What I am doing with the money raised</strong></h3>
<p style="""">The $3200 raised (just under $3000 once Indiegogo takes their share) will allow me to afford the basic services to transform the manuscript into a book (design, layout, a final stage of copy editing), get it formatted for the e-book markets (iBooks, Amazon Kindle, Barnes and Noble, and downloadable .PDF), and make it available for sale online (electronically and print-on-demand) -- all of this, of course, in addition to fulfilling the perks y'all choose for backing the project.</p>
<p style="""">Originally, I had a <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/killermann/social-justice-advocates-handbook-a-guide-to-gende"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">goal of $15K</a>, which would have allowed me to work with an independent designer, independent printshop, provide free physical copies of the book to orgs in need, and to have a budget for marketing and publicity to extend the reach of the book.</p>
<p style="""">It's still my goal to raise enough funds to do some marketing and publicity, but I set the bar lower to ensure that, at the very least, the book gets made, even if it's just in a limited fashion.</p>
<h3 style=""""><strong>Using IndieGoGo is great for two reasons</strong></h3>
<p style="""">One, I retain full creative control over the book. This means I can offer a free version on my site (and I will) and I can also continue allowing others to license my writing and graphics (like the Genderbread Person) for free.</p>
<p style="""">Two, crowdsourcing will give me a sense of how much demand there is for a book like this. My goal is to make it a series. I'm already working on the second book, which will be about sexuality. If this project is successful, I'll have a push to finish that book and starting writing the others (about race, class, and religion).</p>
<p style=""""><em>""More books? But this one is already two! Will those four also be two in ones?! THAT'S SO MANY BOOKS IN BOOKS IN BOOKS IN BOOKS!"" - you, appreciating math</em></p>
<p class=""template asset"" style=""""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/425/130/1bfd61f06b3637a8b310ce7c1224d4fa_large.png?1362525244"" src="""" style=""border: 0px; cursor: default;""/></p>
<h2 style="""">""Tell us more about this book, good sir.""</h2>
<p style="""">The book is broken up into four sections: <em>Basic Training</em> (introduction to core social justice concepts), <em>Breaking Through the Binary</em> (an in-depth exploration of gender diversity), <em>Feminism &amp; Gender Equity</em> (a reconciliation of the main gender equity movement and the teachings of the book), and <em>Social Justice Competence for Working Toward Gender Equity</em> (practical, concrete how-to-type chapters surrounding gender issues and social justice interventions).</p>

UPDATE: STRETCH GOALS
$5000 (REACHED): Everyone who backs $25 or more will get a bunch of Genderbread Person and other fun gender-related swag (stickers, buttons, etc.) with their book
$10,000: For every book (paperback or hardcover) pre-ordered I will send a free book to a high school counselor (backers can name the high schools); like TOMS One For One™ (but without any Trademarks™)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hi, I'm Sam and I'm a social justice advocate & comedian & writer.
For the past few years I've been writing articles about LGBT concepts and creating queer-positive edugraphics on my website, It's Pronounced Metrosexual. Maybe you're familiar with this one:

Well, I wrote a book! It's a guide to gender, from a social justice perspective. It's a couple hundred pages of gender exploration, social justice how-tos, and fun graphics & comics. 
It offers clear, easily-digested, and practical explanations of one of the most commonly misunderstood things about people: gender.
It's not just about the trans* or transgender understanding of gender, though that is certainly a component. It's about gender itself, all-encompassingly, from a socially just and non-binary slant.
I wrote it with two goals in mind. I want to help individuals who read it better understand gender themselves (their gender and others') and I want to help those individuals help other people (who haven't read it) understand gender.
""Two in one? Are you freaking kidding me?! That's one heck of a book!"" - you, I'm guessing

""Why are you crowdsourcing?""
A couple publishers reached out to me to publish this book. There was only one area where we couldn't come to an agreement: I was insistent upon offering a free version through my website and they were insistent that I don't.
It's incredibly important to me that I am able to offer a free electronic copy of this book. Access is one my key values as a social justice advocate, and I don't want even a small fee to stand in the way of someone getting this book and the education it provides.
What I am doing with the money raised
The $3200 raised (just under $3000 once Indiegogo takes their share) will allow me to afford the basic services to transform the manuscript into a book (design, layout, a final stage of copy editing), get it formatted for the e-book markets (iBooks, Amazon Kindle, Barnes and Noble, and downloadable .PDF), and make it available for sale online (electronically and print-on-demand) -- all of this, of course, in addition to fulfilling the perks y'all choose for backing the project.
Originally, I had a goal of $15K, which would have allowed me to work with an independent designer, independent printshop, provide free physical copies of the book to orgs in need, and to have a budget for marketing and publicity to extend the reach of the book.
It's still my goal to raise enough funds to do some marketing and publicity, but I set the bar lower to ensure that, at the very least, the book gets made, even if it's just in a limited fashion.
Using IndieGoGo is great for two reasons
One, I retain full creative control over the book. This means I can offer a free version on my site (and I will) and I can also continue allowing others to license my writing and graphics (like the Genderbread Person) for free.
Two, crowdsourcing will give me a sense of how much demand there is for a book like this. My goal is to make it a series. I'm already working on the second book, which will be about sexuality. If this project is successful, I'll have a push to finish that book and starting writing the others (about race, class, and religion).
""More books? But this one is already two! Will those four also be two in ones?! THAT'S SO MANY BOOKS IN BOOKS IN BOOKS IN BOOKS!"" - you, appreciating math

""Tell us more about this book, good sir.""
The book is broken up into four sections: Basic Training (introduction to core social justice concepts), Breaking Through the Binary (an in-depth exploration of gender diversity), Feminism & Gender Equity (a reconciliation of the main gender equity movement and the teachings of the book), and Social Justice Competence for Working Toward Gender Equity (practical, concrete how-to-type chapters surrounding gender issues and social justice interventions).
Some of the content from the book has appeared on my site, but is fully developed and expanded upon in the book. Each chapter has at least one comic-type graphic to illustrate or make light of a core point.
""Ha! The comics 'illustrate' the core points of the chapters? I see what you did there."" - you, appreciating puns

""Let's talk more about these rewards.""
One quick note: if there's not a reward there that you think should be there (e.g., bulk discounts on copies of the book), let me know. As long as it's reasonable. And not lewd. Lewd is not reasonable.
E-Book and Full Electronic Resources Package ($10 or more)
In addition to the book, I'm creating a ton of resources that will help facilitate conversations and social justice trainings about gender. This reward will be a .ZIP of all of those resources, and include printable formats of worksheets, lesson plans, workshop curricula, activities, discussion guides, and edugraphics.
This package is what will separate the book itself (free e-book or printed copies) from the additionally priced ""trainer's packet"" version once the book is published. It's a great snag for Kickstarter backers to get it for $10 with the e-book -- and one I'm happy to provide as a thanks.
Signed Paperback Copy ($25 or more)
Exactly what it sounds like: a signed and personalized (by yours truly) full-color paperback copy of the finished book.
Signed Hardcover Copy ($50 or more)
Just like the last one, only this one is a hardcover, which means I can sign it harder.

Heartfelt Dedication ($500 or more)
I will have a page in the book, right up front, dedicated to you to show my appreciation for your appreciation.
Appear in the Book, in Comic Form ($1000 or more)
Each chapter has at least one comic-type graphic. How would you like to be immortalized as an adorable character in one of those comics? I pinky promise not to portray you as a bigot. 
Campus Visit ($2000 or more)
The thing that led to me writing this book was my show, It's Pronounced Metrosexual. It's a one-person comedy show about snap judgments, identity, and oppression -- but in a totally funny way. I've performed at schools all over the US, topraise from students and staff alike. 
If you support this project, I'll come to your campus (or organization/business) for a day. I can do my show, lead workshops/discussions, consult and provide feedback on campus initiatives or organizations -- really, the sky's the limit. And I'll do it for a comprehensive fee of $2000 (travel, lodging, etc., included).
Hug ($5000 or more)
I'll find you. And I'll hug you. I've been told I'm a million-dollar hugger, so you're welcome in advance.
 

Thanks for not eating me.
I appreciate you taking the time learn about this project. Of all the things I've created, I believe this book is the best. It's so much of what I've done, and what matters to me, all smashed into one thing.
I also want to take a moment to thank the team of 40 editors from whom I was fortunate enough to get feedback on the manuscript.

<p>I’m soliciting donations so I can return to humanitarian aid work as a Peace Corps volunteer. Assignments last 27 months and I intend to complete at least two tours. I’ve already completed two one-year tours with WorldTeach (Marshall Islands, 2009-2011) and have already been accepted by the Peace Corps, receiving a nomination for service in Latin America. I had intended to come home and work for a year to raise money, but have not have been able to find sufficient work to support myself and raise the necessary funds, so I’m trying this to get back into the game . . .</p>
<p><strong>Check out the perks, and, as an added bonus, I am going to give my baby to one donor!</strong></p>
<p><strong>If Yours Is the Winning Donation!</strong><br/>• I will deliver the car, fully tuned and detailed to you anywhere in the lower 48 states;<br/>• I will sell the car (minimum price $1200.00) and forward the funds to you;<br/>• I will place title in your name and donate the car to a charity of your choosing so you can claim the tax deduction ($1700.00 value)</p>

<p><strong>About My Baby!</strong><br/>She is a 1982 BMW 528e. I am the second owner and have taken diligent care of all regular maintenance and repairs since purchasing her in 2001. Engine, transmission, suspension, tires, heat and a/c are all sound and well maintained. The body is in good shape; some minor corrosion and a few dings. A complete maintenance file has been kept. She would be a great “knock around” vehicle, first car for the kid or something a BMW aficionado would have a lot of fun restoring. Or, if you have no need of the car, she can be sold or donated to charity for considerably more than the price of a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>How I Will Use the Funds!</strong><br/>• To provide any additional equipment or articles I will need for my next assignment (depends on where I get posted);<br/>• Maintain the expenses of keeping “on the grid” in the US (PO Box, my US cell phone number, SKYPE, online fax, AAA card, etc);<br/>• Supplement my food stipend to insure I remain healthy while in the field.<br/>NO funds will be spent to support me in any way while I am in the US, or on leaves or vacations in the field.</p>

<p><strong>What Happens If I Don't Raise the Entire Subscription?</strong><br/>Even raising half of this amount will allow me to do at least one tour, but I am hoping that I will raise enough so that I can just keep getting reassigned to field work until I am too old.

<p>Brian Lelas is a fiction author from Ireland, hoping to spread his unique stories throughout the world. This campaign is to fund his second collection of short stories.

<p>Here he presents a collection of short stories titled <em>Phantoms Doused in Night</em><em>.</em> This collection features stories from a wide range of genres including literary fiction, science fiction, horror, fable and thriller. Here's what he has to say about the book...</p>
<p><img alt=""Banner 01"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x33/laerfan/banner01.jpg?t=1366751756"" src="""" style="""" title=""Banner 01""/></p>
<p><em>Phantoms Doused in Night</em> is a project that demanded its own existence. There was no plan to make this book happen, it just banged on the back of my brain and asked to be born. Sometimes as a writer, you get really bogged down in writing something big and daunting, that it takes years, (literally <em>years</em>) to finish it and even longer to find a way to get it out into the world. To survive those years, I take breaks from the main path and explore little forests, tunnels and – more often than not – darker places, in search of something to fuel the greater journey. This book is a collection of those little meanderings, but to my surprise, they have turned out to be a true journey of their own. Other travels continue, but this is the one that I would like to share now.</p>
<p>Eleven stories make up the collection that is <em>Phantoms Doused in Night</em>. Some were planned, some were not, one came in a dream and one wrote itself while I stared horrified at my fingers as they typed. When you read them, try to guess which one.</p>
<p>This collection is special to me for many reasons, but the main one is that I want to share these thoughts and words with the people who asked for more after my first book, <em>Dead Cartography</em>. A lot of people had some wonderful things to say about that set. I wanted to share another path, one for those who craved answers, and even moreso for those who begged for further questions.</p>
<p>Through the three years that these tales were born, I have been eagerly working to deliver something special to anyone ready to read it and I thank you for showing an interest so far. If you consider backing this little piece of my time and mind, I will be eternally grateful. If this is something of a success it will be a real asset to me when seeking out partners for future projects. If that can happen, it would be a dream come true.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>

<h3>Stretch Goals! More Phantoms if the book exceeds its target goal.</h3>
<p>Everyone who backs the book gets their name printed inside on a credits page if the funding goal is reached and anyone who wants to add a short message can do so too.</p>
<p>All of the photographs used in this campaign are by Frieda Freytag. Many of them are considerations for the final cover of the book. Some directly influenced stories that made it into the book. Special bookmarks of each of the images will be printed and added to every delivery from the Physical Phantoms level and up if the project exceeds €1000, which is double the target goal.</p>
<p>If there is a huge success and the project reaches €3000, Brian will write a new story that will bring the total stories up to 12, which will make it into every version of the book. This 12th story is not yet written and will be the first story completed since announcing the collection.</p>
<p>If the project somehow manages to reach €6000, which is a big ask, Brian has promised an entirely new collection of six stories to every backer for FREE upon completion in the next two years.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Why crowdfunding? Where does the money go?</h3>
<p>Brian chose to crowdfund <em>Phantoms Doused in Night</em> for numerous reasons. The first and most obvious reason was for an easier way to get the book out there without looking for a traditional publisher. To do that, some money is needed for printing costs (with a top quality printing partner), an ISBN to get the book international saleability and if we're all lucky, to buy his son some sweets when it's all done. The other reason was to see if this was a viable and successful way to go forward for other projects that he is actively completing and editing in the long term, plus a way to demonstrate that there are people looking for good, original writing. Any money that is somehow made as a result of this campaign will go directly into setting up the <em>next</em> campaign and also adding any possible extra goodies to the shipments being sent to everyone who makes it possible, like stretch goals and little bonuses.</p>

Stretch Goals! More Phantoms if the book exceeds its target goal.
Everyone who backs the book gets their name printed inside on a credits page if the funding goal is reached and anyone who wants to add a short message can do so too.
All of the photographs used in this campaign are by Frieda Freytag. Many of them are considerations for the final cover of the book. Some directly influenced stories that made it into the book. Special bookmarks of each of the images will be printed and added to every delivery from the Physical Phantoms level and up if the project exceeds €1000, which is double the target goal.
If there is a huge success and the project reaches €3000, Brian will write a new story that will bring the total stories up to 12, which will make it into every version of the book. This 12th story is not yet written and will be the first story completed since announcing the collection.
If the project somehow manages to reach €6000, which is a big ask, Brian has promised an entirely new collection of six stories to every backer for FREE upon completion in the next two years.

 
Why crowdfunding? Where does the money go?
Brian chose to crowdfund Phantoms Doused in Night for numerous reasons. The first and most obvious reason was for an easier way to get the book out there without looking for a traditional publisher. To do that, some money is needed for printing costs (with a top quality printing partner), an ISBN to get the book international saleability and if we're all lucky, to buy his son some sweets when it's all done. The other reason was to see if this was a viable and successful way to go forward for other projects that he is actively completing and editing in the long term, plus a way to demonstrate that there are people looking for good, original writing. Any money that is somehow made as a result of this campaign will go directly into setting up the next campaign and also adding any possible extra goodies to the shipments being sent to everyone who makes it possible, like stretch goals and little bonuses.

<h3>Our project:</h3>
<div>We provide free weekly media workshops in the Bay Area and reservations around the country, where we train Indigenous youth how to create and publish a full-color magazine, Seventh Native American Generation (SNAG), which includes a compilation CD featuring Native music. We teach youth how to write, create art, take photographs, report and interview and do layout/design. Through our program, youth express themselves, and share their thoughts with the world!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For our latest issue, ""Fears and Dreams,"" SNAG staff held workshops with Native American youth from Chemawa High School in Salem, Oregon; with Northwest Youth Conference participants in Omak, Washington; and with Bay Area youth. We explored what they fear, and what they dream of. We also feature in this issue youth interviews with Native artists and leaders, an article on the SNAG bio-diesel powered shuttle bus, a ""how to"" guide to organizing, and as always, beautiful art!</div>

<p>Hi, my name is Tara Frauendienst and I am what you might call a freelance copyeditor.  I am a stay at home mom of a 19 month old boy, and I have to make time to edit, but it’s worth it for the reader to be able to clearly understand what the author meant.  I have been working with Zoe E. Whitten on her latest book series, Peter the Wolf, to get each book ready for public view. In fact, I was a customer of the first book, and noticed mistakes her previous editor had missed, and sent them to her out of the kindness of my heart, not really expecting anything in return.  Zoe is a fabulous author and it was a pleasure to edit for her.  Zoe is being very generous by donating copies of her latest book as well as the others in the series and her bestsellers to help raise funds for me. </p>
<p><strong>And now a word from the author:</strong></p>
<p>Hi, I’m Zoe E. Whitten, author of the Peter the Wolf series. I’m putting together a funding drive for the third book in the series, Roll the Bones, which is already completed and was edited by the lovely Tara Frauendienst. She edited the first two books for a percentage of the sales, which hasn’t been nearly enough for all the work she did, in my opinion. So this funding drive is all for Tara, and regardless of the amount collected, I won’t make a dime off of this funding drive. All proceeds will go to Tara, who could use the money for bills, groceries, and to help clothe her baby boy, who is no doubt growing out of clothes quickly.</p>
<p><strong>But what’s in it for you? </strong></p>
<p>Anyone who donates $5 will get a free ebook copy of Roll the Bones in their choice of PDF, Mobi, or ePub as soon as the final draft is done. This should not take long, as I already have paid for the cover image, and I already have Tara’s editing notes to work through. All people who donate will also get their names listed in the back of the book, AND a copy of Blind Rage.</p>
<p>For $10 readers will also receive a copy of Dogs of War in their preferred format, AND a copy of Blind Rage. <br/><br/></p>
<p>For $15 you will receive a copy of Peter the Wolf, Dogs of War, Roll the Bones, Blind Rage, and Sandy Morrision and the Pack of Pussies.</p>
<p>Finally, for those brave souls willing to donate $25, you’ll get all three books, Blind Rage, Sandy Morrison and the Pack of Pussies, plus copies of The Campaign Trilogy and the spin-off, A Perfectly Empty Vessel. The Campaign Trilogy has been my most popular works to date, and A Perfectly Empty Vessel follows Wendy Stoffel, “Hunter of serial killers,” to solve a new case in Sin City. And you can get all four books in your chosen format for your generous donation to my editor.</p>
<p><br/> But what are you signing up for in this third book? Well I’ll go ahead and warn you that this blurb spoils the first two books. I’ve spent a long time trying to think how to blurb a third book in a series without giving something away from the first two books, and this one...it’s just about impossible. So, if you would prefer to just read the blurb for book one, look here: <a href=""http://zoewhitten.com/2011/06/24/introducing-peter-the-wolf/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://zoewhitten.com/2011/06/24/introducing-pe...</a>. And if that makes you curious to see the blurb for book 2, look here: <a href=""http://zoewhitten.com/2012/02/27/dogs-of-war-now-available/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://zoewhitten.com/2012/02/27/dogs-of-war-no...</a>.<br/><br/><strong>Spoiler warning’s out of the way, so here goes:</strong><br/><br/> Peter Holmes, an eighteen-year-old lycanthrope and former cheerleader and gymnast, has agreed to kill a vampire for the harpy who had been keeping his sister as a slave for five years of brutal torture. Peter will do anything to keep the harpy from taking his sister back, but he isn’t clear on who his real target is. The harpy doesn’t make matters easier with the head games she’s playing to feed off of his pain, both physical and emotional.<br/><br/> After arriving at his destination, the harpy pits Peter against a “training target,” and he loses against the diminutive Cassandra, leading to more punishment from the harpy. If Peter can’t even beat a tiny child vampire, an abomination among her own people, what hope does he have in killing his real target? An ambush from the adult vampires confirms his worst fears, and Peter is almost killed by their brutal torture.<br/><br/> He barely survives, but with time to heal, a lot of training from a witch, and some major favors from his allies in the FBI, Peter may pull off the most surprising role of his budding acting career. That is, if the other vampires buy into his act and let him live, of course.</p></div>","A word from the Editor:

<h3></h3>
<h3>So Basically...</h3>
<a href=""http://thekurosawaproject.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">The Kurosawa Project</a> is a multi-media, multi-platform textbook/educational resource exploring the interconnectedness of Japanese cinema, culture and history, through the films of Akira Kurosawa. <br/><br/><br/>The Project aims to tackle this goal while investigating alternative ways of presenting educational materials to young learners with new modes of processing information. <br/><br/><br/><h3>And More Pointedly...</h3>The Kurosawa Project aims to introduce a new generation of students and the general public to the films of Akira Kurosawa, while extensively contextualizing them with discussions of Japanese history, culture, society, film criticism and the interconnectedness thereof.<br/><br/><br/>The majority of existing resources on Kurosawa focus predominantly on the director's films as objects in and of themselves, examining their technical merits, narrative devices and place in film history. The Kurosawa Project focuses instead on the intense and fascinating connection between Kurosawa's films and Japanese history and culture.<br/><br/><br/>Kurosawa directly engaged his society and its complex themes and issues. He made films for the masses with the purpose of entertaining and engaging his countrymen, with underlying themes and ideas available for intellectual analysis and interpretation.<br/><br/><br/>Unfortunately, the majority of resources available regarding Kurosawa and his works emphasize the complexity of his films while downplaying in large measure their mass appeal. The Kurosawa Project aims to show readers and learners that Japanese films are not as complicated as scholars make them out to be; they are the perfect documents through which to explore the rich and complex culture and history of Japanese society.<br/><br/><br/><h3>What We'll Do With Your Money...</h3>The money raised by The Kurosawa Project will go toward the development and creation of the website.<br/><br/><br/>As of now, the template for the site consists of a simple, free Word Press format. As the Project collects funds through IndieGoGo, we'll purchase interactive, complex formats for the site, capable of hosting elements such as podcasts and film commentaries, while developing a forum and other site features.<br/><br/><br/>What's more, The Project aims to create a smart phone app for the materials posted on the site, and, in the long term, a digital edition of the book portion of the project for the iPad and readers like the Kindle.<br/><br/><br/>Money will also go into the purchase of materials necessary for the project, including some out-of-print and rare research materials on Japanese history and film and improved equipment/software for creating the podcasts and videos for the Kurosawa Project website.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Are Donations Tax Deductible?</h3>Unfortunately, no.<br/><br/><br/>The Kurosawa Project does not have 501(c)(3) status and cannot offer this. Sorry.<br/><br/><br/><h3>What's The Schedule For The Project?</h3>If everything goes according to plan, The Kurosawa Project will launch in earnest in late November 2011.<br/><br/><br/>When the Project launches ""in earnest,"" we'll begin posting videos and podcasts every week, along with discussion questions for each Kurosawa movie and experts from the textbook portion of the project.<br/><br/><h3>What's Up With the Audio Commentaries?</h3>The audio commentaries will be recorded as podcasts and made available for free, unlimited streaming and downloading from The Kurosawa Project website.<br/><br/><br/>During the commentary, we'll tell you exactly when to start the film so the commentary track cues up with your DVD/VHS/Blu-Ray.<br/><br/><br/><h3>I Disagree With Some Information Presented In Your Podcast And Video</h3>The podcast, video and sample chapter currently available on the project website are rough drafts. When the Project launches in earnest, we'll redo both the video and podcast, tweaking them for accuracy and quality.<br/><br/><br/>That said, thanks for keeping us on our toes. Feel free to email thekurosawaproject@gmail.com with any serious concerns.<br/><br/><h3>Why Are You Qualified To Do This?</h3>I'm glad you asked.<br/><br/><br/>I hold a degree in Art History and Japanese Language and Literature from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. As an undergraduate, I spent a year studying Japanese art, photography, film, language and society at Jochi Daigaku/Sophia University, in Tokyo. This year was partially funded by a grant from the Freeman Foundation.<br/><br/><br/>In the spring of 2005, I ran a Japanese Club at the Amherst Middle School.

</div></div>","So Basically...
The Kurosawa Project is a multi-media, multi-platform textbook/educational resource exploring the interconnectedness of Japanese cinema, culture and history, through the films of Akira Kurosawa. The Project aims to tackle this goal while investigating alternative ways of presenting educational materials to young learners with new modes of processing information. And More Pointedly...The Kurosawa Project aims to introduce a new generation of students and the general public to the films of Akira Kurosawa, while extensively contextualizing them with discussions of Japanese history, culture, society, film criticism and the interconnectedness thereof.The majority of existing resources on Kurosawa focus predominantly on the director's films as objects in and of themselves, examining their technical merits, narrative devices and place in film history. The Kurosawa Project focuses instead on the intense and fascinating connection between Kurosawa's films and Japanese history and culture.Kurosawa directly engaged his society and its complex themes and issues. He made films for the masses with the purpose of entertaining and engaging his countrymen, with underlying themes and ideas available for intellectual analysis and interpretation.Unfortunately, the majority of resources available regarding Kurosawa and his works emphasize the complexity of his films while downplaying in large measure their mass appeal. The Kurosawa Project aims to show readers and learners that Japanese films are not as complicated as scholars make them out to be; they are the perfect documents through which to explore the rich and complex culture and history of Japanese society.What We'll Do With Your Money...The money raised by The Kurosawa Project will go toward the development and creation of the website.As of now, the template for the site consists of a simple, free Word Press format. As the Project collects funds through IndieGoGo, we'll purchase interactive, complex formats for the site, capable of hosting elements such as podcasts and film commentaries, while developing a forum and other site features.What's more, The Project aims to create a smart phone app for the materials posted on the site, and, in the long term, a digital edition of the book portion of the project for the iPad and readers like the Kindle.Money will also go into the purchase of materials necessary for the project, including some out-of-print and rare research materials on Japanese history and film and improved equipment/software for creating the podcasts and videos for the Kurosawa Project website.Are Donations Tax Deductible?Unfortunately, no.The Kurosawa Project does not have 501(c)(3) status and cannot offer this. Sorry.What's The Schedule For The Project?If everything goes according to plan, The Kurosawa Project will launch in earnest in late November 2011.When the Project launches ""in earnest,"" we'll begin posting videos and podcasts every week, along with discussion questions for each Kurosawa movie and experts from the textbook portion of the project.What's Up With the Audio Commentaries?The audio commentaries will be recorded as podcasts and made available for free, unlimited streaming and downloading from The Kurosawa Project website.During the commentary, we'll tell you exactly when to start the film so the commentary track cues up with your DVD/VHS/Blu-Ray.I Disagree With Some Information Presented In Your Podcast And VideoThe podcast, video and sample chapter currently available on the project website are rough drafts. When the Project launches in earnest, we'll redo both the video and podcast, tweaking them for accuracy and quality.That said, thanks for keeping us on our toes. Feel free to email thekurosawaproject@gmail.com with any serious concerns.Why Are You Qualified To Do This?I'm glad you asked.I hold a degree in Art History and Japanese Language and Literature from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. As an undergraduate, I spent a year studying Japanese art, photography, film, language and society at Jochi Daigaku/Sophia University, in Tokyo. This year was partially funded by a grant from the Freeman Foundation.In the spring of 2005, I ran a Japanese Club at the Amherst Middle School. Each week, students and I explored ways of understanding and interpreting Japanese culture and society through manga, anime, videogames and cultural objects like toys and even candy.Upon leaving Amherst for New York City, I volunteered at Japan Society film screenings, during which time I saw a number of classic, popular, obscure and avant-garde Japanese films while engaging with Japan Society employees, fellow volunteers and audience members.For the past 18 months, I've worked as a fulltime professional freelance writer, covering topics from Japan (its art, history, economy and the recent earthquake and tsunami) to music, film, television, history, soccer and even biology, botany and business.What's more, I write almost exclusively for websites. This experience has allowed me to intimately familiarize myself with ever-evolving modes of presenting and consuming information, particularly for younger generations than my own.My knowledge of Japan and extensive history studying its culture, combined with my experience as a web writer, makes me well suited to tackling a project of this nature.Don't Forget to Spread the Word!Please share The Kurosawa Project with anyone you might know who has an interest in Japanese language, literature, culture, history or Japan in general.

I work a full time job that pays enough to cover my bills (sometimes not even that), and suddenly I found myself facing a reality I'd never considered: paying to have my manuscript edited.

It's the first step towards actually publishing a book, the first step towards being able to call myself a ""writer"" and not just an ""aspiring writer.""
What We Need & What You Get
Here is exactly what I'm looking for:


Raise enough money to hire a professional editor to provide proofreading, copy editing for grammar, punctuation, spelling and consistency. If I reach my goal I will be able to have the editor provide services for story development as well.

 


What you get for your money ($10 or more): See your name in print! As a contributor, you'll get your name in the front part of the book listed as ""Earth Borne is made possible by..."" This page will be titled Contributor Page.

If you donate $20 or more: For $20 and your shipping address, I'll send you a series of 4x6 art prints inspired by Earth Borne. These will be printed on photo paper, using images and artwork created while writing the story and during the campaign itself. I'll transpose text directly from the story.

If I surpass my goal - the money will go to the editor to provide better services for Earth Borne.

The Impact
Your contribution will make my story a reality. It will go from being a manuscript that I wrote for National Novel Writing Month, to a fully edited and quality manuscript. That's where the real work begins for me; the re-writing process that will eventually be turned in to the finished product.
To give you an idea of how substantial the costs of editing are: the editors I have approached generally charge $0.01 per word to be edited (and that's just editing for spelling and grammar, this isn't even considering developmental work).

You'll help me with the first step in the publication process: the professional evaluation of my manuscript, where I'll receive meaningful feedback and assistance to take the first draft to the next level.


This is a step I won't be able to take without your financial assistance.

Other Ways You Can Help
I understand that not everyone can contribute financially (I am often one of those people!). However, there are other ways you can help make Earth Borne a success:

Read the story! Then, if you like it - and want to see it closer to publication, tell your friends!
Help me get the word out! Share this project to Facebook and Twitter.

So, what's the story about?
Earth Borne is a dark science fiction story written for National Novel Writing Month in November 2012.
Meghan is a young woman growing up in the sleepy town of Maple Falls. She's the daughter of one of the richest and most influential men in town, Doctor Konrad Lacroix. Konrad owns ISIS Laboratories - a Biochemical research facility just outside of town.
When a strange explosion rocks the ISIS facility one morning, Meghan's world is changed forever. Her life begins to spiral out of control as she receives a mysterious package from a long dead relative that threatens everything she thought she knew about her father.
Then, the Earth Borne appear.
Meghan may be the key to stopping the mysterious Earth Borne - but will she survive long enough to save the town of Maple Falls? Will she discover the truth about her father?

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Kalua pig and cabbage, teriyaki chicken, laulau, SPAM musubi.  For as long as I can remember, food has been an integral part of my identity and how I see the world.  The first 20+ years of my life were spent on tropical islands.  My name is Danielle Ceribo, and I grew up on Guam and then lived on Oahu, Hawai'i.  I recently earned my master's degree in Gastronomy studying the connection between food and culture.  I wrote my master's thesis on how Guam's history of colonialism and globalization have affected its foodways, which was the first time anyone had written about it.  Most of my research was interview-based, as it was extremely important to me to provide a platform for the people of Guam's voice to be heard, which had been ignored and silenced in the past. </p>
<p>This past September, I was offered this amazing opportunity to write about a topic that has not had very much in-depth research on: the plate lunch.  I will be conducting research on how the plate lunch came to be such an important part of local dining culture, what kinds of foods are included in the plate lunch and why, as well as who are the ones that eat the plate lunch, and where plate lunches are sold.  Though it has been written about countlessly in newspaper articles both on the island and in the mainland US, this will be the first book dedicated solely to the topic.  The plate lunch is tied to Hawai'i's history and culture, and I am excited to be able to share this with locals, visitors, scholars, and anyone interested in learning more about what makes plate lunches so delicious and how they came about.</p>
<p>It is crucial to convey our own histories from our own perspectives.  That is why, in order to produce a project that is grounded in the history, culture, and voice of the locals of Hawai'i, I feel it is necessary to do fieldwork in the place itself as opposed to relying on secondary sources.  I will be on Oahu for approximately 2-3 months gathering as much data as possible, then I will return home to write. </p>
<p>Your contribution will help make this project a reality.  Otherwise I would not financially be able to complete the quality of work it deserves.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Luckily, I already have a publisher that will pay any and all publishing/marketing expenses.  What I need is help doing the actual research, which roughly includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airfare from Boston (where I live) to Honolulu</li>
<li>Living expenses in Honolulu to include food (for research, of course, and personal sustenance) and gas (it's Hawai'i)</li>
<li>Personal expenses, since being in Hawai'i for only 2-3 months will make it difficult for me to find employment, though I will do what I can when I am there</li>
</ul>
<p>You can donate from the approximate cost of one plate lunch ($5.00 for a ""mini"") to the cost of the plane ticket ($650).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can make donations to my PayPal account (<a href=""mailto:dceribo@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dceribo@gmail.com</a>).  </p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute, please forward this campaign to your friends, families, and networks (you can do so by using the Indiegogo share tools!). </p>

This past September, I was offered this amazing opportunity to write about a topic that has not had very much in-depth research on: the plate lunch.  I will be conducting research on how the plate lunch came to be such an important part of local dining culture, what kinds of foods are included in the plate lunch and why, as well as who are the ones that eat the plate lunch, and where plate lunches are sold.  Though it has been written about countlessly in newspaper articles both on the island and in the mainland US, this will be the first book dedicated solely to the topic.  The plate lunch is tied to Hawai'i's history and culture, and I am excited to be able to share this with locals, visitors, scholars, and anyone interested in learning more about what makes plate lunches so delicious and how they came about.
It is crucial to convey our own histories from our own perspectives.  That is why, in order to produce a project that is grounded in the history, culture, and voice of the locals of Hawai'i, I feel it is necessary to do fieldwork in the place itself as opposed to relying on secondary sources.  I will be on Oahu for approximately 2-3 months gathering as much data as possible, then I will return home to write. 
Your contribution will help make this project a reality.  Otherwise I would not financially be able to complete the quality of work it deserves.


What I Need & What You Get
Luckily, I already have a publisher that will pay any and all publishing/marketing expenses.  What I need is help doing the actual research, which roughly includes:

Airfare from Boston (where I live) to Honolulu
Living expenses in Honolulu to include food (for research, of course, and personal sustenance) and gas (it's Hawai'i)
Personal expenses, since being in Hawai'i for only 2-3 months will make it difficult for me to find employment, though I will do what I can when I am there

You can donate from the approximate cost of one plate lunch ($5.00 for a ""mini"") to the cost of the plane ticket ($650).


Other Ways You Can Help
You can make donations to my PayPal account (dceribo@gmail.com).

<p>Hello boils and ghouls, and horror fans the world over! It is my great pleasure to unveil to you my newest passion project, Something Good to Eat, a Halloween-themed anthology bringing together fifteen tales from some of the genres's most dynamic voices, both established and new. Featuring tales of witches, monsters, demonic possession, ghosts, ghoulies and assorted terrifying beasties, Something Good to Eat aims to scare the socks off the reader in the grand ol' tradition of E.C. Comics, Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, among other anthologies, but with as much of a comtemporary flair as possible. It's the sort of book to read curled up in a big comfy chair, on a dark and cold October night...with the doors firmly and sensibly locked, of course. </p>
<p>I am a writer, editor and die hard genre fan developing a publishing venture that aims to showcase the voices and talents that often get overlooked by the big players in the field. As an avid consumer and fan, it is my goal to help keep the powerful and vital medium of the short story alive and kicking well into the 21st Century...and beyond. My own short stories have appeared in anthologies from Castrum Press, Phantasmagoria, and The Weirdbook, and I have been an Arts and Entertainment editor on my local newspaper for the past five years. I am a passionate about what I do and equally passionate about the fine work being done by other writers the world over. </p>
<p>From the official synopsis:</p>
<p>Halloween: a night when the dead roam freely among the unsuspecting living; when the boundary between reality and fantasy, between this world and the next, is as thin as paper mache; when monsters both human and daemonic stalk the shadows, seeking easy prey…</p>
<p>All Hallow’s Eve: a night to hide behind your best mask, lock your doors, and keep your Jack-o’-lantern burning till dawn. Because Something is knocking at the door, boys and girls…</p>
<p>And it’s hungry.</p>

<h3>What We Ghouls Need &amp; What You Monsters Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>My goal as far as this crowd-funding endevour goes is to raise $4,500. This figure goes to paying some of the writers, hiring an assistant editor, and paying for further cover design and interior layout. Seeing as this is my fledgling press' first anthology, it is important to me (and to readers) that the guts of the anthology look as immaculate and professional as possible. Far too often do you read self-published or small press book releases that simply do not look like any care was put into them. I am hoping to avoid this at all costs. </li>
<li>Those of you generous witches and demons who donate $100 or more shall receive a copy of the anthology, a t-shirt featuring the ghoulishly delightful cover art, and a poster-sized print of a ""variant"" cover, illustrated by comic book artist and certified madman Trevor Markwart.</li>
<li>If the full goal is not reached, what contributions have been made will go to paying the writers, and all contributors will receive a copy of the book. </li>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Por el contrario se trata de tener una vida, en donde con la pareja nos inspiremos mutuamente a ser mejores humanos, a vivir la vida de una manera intensa y mágica, llena de valores , palabras amables, sueños que construir juntos.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Es un reto que mejora la vida emocional de muchas personas, más hogares se mantienen juntos, y más niños CRECEN FELICES porque pueden ver que sus PAPÁS SE AMAN.</p>

Estamos viviendo tan de prisa, tan preocupados y estresados que estamos sacrificando momentos valiosos con nuestras personas especiales, y el tiempo se nos va…
Es por esto, que nació El Reto de los 3 meses, es un juego que pretende rescatar la esencia del ser humano, recuperar lo que nos hace felices, que es el tener  tiempo de calidad, el ser agradecido y sentirnos valorados por las personas que más amamos, es tener con nuestra pareja una relación sana, llena de buenos hábitos que mantienen al amor en una base sólida pero sin dejar de enamorándonos ni un solo día, impidiendo que la monotonía apague esa magia.
Por el contrario se trata de tener una vida, en donde con la pareja nos inspiremos mutuamente a ser mejores humanos, a vivir la vida de una manera intensa y mágica, llena de valores , palabras amables, sueños que construir juntos.
Es un reto que mejora la vida emocional de muchas personas, más hogares se mantienen juntos, y más niños CRECEN FELICES porque pueden ver que sus PAPÁS SE AMAN.
 
Soy Paz, y siento que mi nombre para mi representa mucho. Soy Psicóloga Clínica. Y me encanta mi carrera.

<h3>!!! Faaar Out, the book</h3>
<p>I’m Carl Franzen. I wrote the song, “On the Road,” which John Denver recorded on his <i>Back Home Again</i> album. Now I’ve written a book about Young John Denver—stories about John before he became famous. </p>
<p>This book started as an oral history project. I went on the road with my camera to interview people who befriended or influenced John Denver before he became famous. As I researched and listened, the idea evolved. The project became a book. Not a history book but a genealogy journal. You’ll see stories that reveal John’s confidence, his energy, and the unique talents he shared. Threads that weave from one person to another, connections that generously set the table for his iconic career.</p>
<p>My purpose was not to rewrite John’s narrative, but to offer a glimpse into his coming of age, and his arrival at the doorstep of fame. Sometimes the storytellers take over and become more important than the reader might expect. It’s as if we are participants at a pickin’ party, each with a different instrument, each with a favorite song to sing. Smiling, strumming, playing a catchy riff to grab your attention. Always, however, with a single destination:  <i>Who was Young John Denver?</i>​</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's inside this book?</h3>
<p>I take the reader on a journey from Randy Sparks, who gave John his first boost, to the Chad Mitchell Trio, which led to John's first blush with fame and the introduction to his political will. And finally, to the recording of his breakout hit, ""Take Me Home, Country Roads.""</p>
<p>I was delighted to meet the real Bobbie from John's first song, ""For Bobbie."" Bill Danoff took me back to working sound and lights at the Cellar Door in Washington D.C, where John first sang ""Take Me Home Country Roads."" And while Jim Connor played ""Grandma's Feather Bed,"" a chicken squawked in his back yard in Alabama.</p>
<p>I talked with the priest who guided the Chad Mitchell Trio to New York and introduced them to Nina Simone's agent, who led them to Milt Okun. In Minnesota, I was fascinated by all the introductions Nancy Nelson made on John's behalf, included to the DJ who first played the grooves out of ""Country Roads"" before it charted. And I heard what happened when John called Annie's dormatory to ask for a first date. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>I'm looking for a few good readers</h3>
<p>This book will begin as a Limited Reader Edition, 100 copies for patient readers who enjoy letting the story come to them. I'd like you to be one of those valuable readers. </p>
<p>I will send you a signed, first edition of<i> !!! Faaar Out</i>, and regardless of your feelings after receiving the book—good or bad—I invite you to write a review and post it here, or share your thoughts with friends on social media. Of course, I hope it delights and surprises you.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello and thanks for your interest in this story!</p>
<p>I'm an award-winning investigative journalist with a track record of breaking major stories for publications such as The Independent,  Al Jazeera, The Guardian and the Sunday Herald, including front page splashes that have shaped the news agenda.</p>
<p>I have recently been investigating the Cambridge Analytica story and was the first journalist to reveal their <a href=""http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2018/03/20/scl-a-very-british-coup/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">links</a> to the Conservative Party and have <a href=""http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2018/03/20/scl-a-very-british-coup/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">exposed</a> further holes in the government's statements on the issue, in my articles for Bella Caledonia.</p>
<p>Journalism at its core should be about holding power to account. That's why I am determined to investigate this story further. With a catalogue of elections interfered in from Nigeria to Bulgaria, Brexit to Trump, rarely have we seen such unaccountable power wielded as shown by Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group. What's really concerning is that they appear to have close ties to our own state institutions.  With your support, I will investigate:</p>
<ul>
<li>The worldwide activities of SCL Group and which governments and organisations they have collaborated with</li>
<li>The background and political links of SLC Group's board, directors and shareholders</li>
<li>How closely has the British government worked with Cambridge Analytica/SLC Group to interfere in elections and democracies globally?</li>
<li>If SLC Group is really just a private arm of the British Ministry of Defence?</li>
<li>How big a role did SCL Group/Cambridge Analytica/Aggregate IQ play in Brexit?</li>
<li>How closely is SCL Group tied to the US state department? </li>
<li>What other elections or referendum were they involved in? For instance was there any involvement in the Scottish independence referendum in 2014? </li>
<li>What was the cause of Dan Muresan (Christopher Wylie's predecessor) mysterious death in Kenya? </li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the areas I will begin investigating, if there is anything you don't think is being covered, then get in touch and I will look into it!  </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>In order to fully investigative this issue, it will take time and resources. With your support, I can put other projects to one side and dedicate the coming weeks (and possibly longer) to investigating this issue fully. Along the way I will give regular updates via: </p>
<ul>
<li>A series of articles on the website Bella Caledonia, as well as regular updates on Twitter</li>
<li>Working with Phantom Power films, I will give regular video updates and we will also interview other experts on this subject </li>
<li>To funders, I will be directly contactable and available to provide news, discuss findings and  other leads or issues of interest</li>

<h3>Story of my book</h3>
<p><i>Trillion Dollar Fortune </i>is a book about how India will join the United States and China to become the world’s third-largest economy and emerge as a leader in sustainable development this decade. The COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the world’s economies and exposed the harsh vulnerabilities in the global system. The stark differences between the developed world and developing world highlight that there is much more work to be done in global development. Through insights from leaders across business, technology, academia, governments, and nonprofit organizations, my book will help you pave an understanding of how entrepreneurship and innovation can be used to tackle urgent issues such as demographic shifts, artificial intelligence, climate change, and poverty.<br/><br/>My name is Faeez Juneja, and I am the author of Trillion Dollar Fortune. I wrote this book because I am passionate about sustainability, technology, and globalization. I was born in India but raised in the United States for most of my life. I have moved across different cities in my life, and I have witnessed the stark contrast between the life I was living and the lives of others. My observations have also reflected on the transformative impact that technology and business have on uplifting communities, especially in India. I want to explore ways we can harness innovation to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals and build a more equitable future.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how India will be joining the United States and China to become a global power later this decade and the geopolitical, economic, environmental, and technological opportunities that a rising India will have for the world. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for business and sustainability . And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand the key trends that are shaping our collective future and how you can be a part of the new post-pandemic world that emphasizes social impact over shareholder profit.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about India's rise in global development and international business. Some of these topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why India is the fifth-largest economy in the world, how it can reach its $5 trillion target through becoming more sustainable and inclusive, and why transforming India will be the biggest business opportunity of the century. I will explore how Invest India has become the top investment promotion agency, attracting over $161 billion in foreign direct investment pipeline alone across all sectors.</li>
<li>How India is the world’s third-largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions but also has emerged as a global leader in renewable energy. India is the only major country in the world that remains on track to overachieve its 2°C compatible Paris Agreement climate action targets. I will explore how India can become a success story for developing countries that want to achieve economic growth while combating climate change.</li>
<li>The rise of the Indo-Pacific region in geopolitics and global business as the US bolsters its presence in the region by building deeper cooperation with India and countries such as Japan, Australia, and South Korea to balance China’s $1 Trillion Brick and Road Initiative.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in innovative solutions and shaping the world’s responses to the most urgent technological, economic, and social challenges in a global context.<br/><br/><i>Trillion Dollar Fortune</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to international business professionals and technology enthusiasts who are looking at sustainability, India, and geopolitics for the first time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Book - Trillion Dollar Fortune</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts:</p>
<p>Part 1 contains the Introduction and Chapters 1-2. This part will focus on exploring the global order today, the role that the US and China are playing, the critical challenges that the world faces, and the need for India to emerge as a global power. There are insights on how China emerged as the world’s largest economy by purchasing power parity in just 40 years and how the country is building a new geopolitical, economic, and technological architecture for the 21st century. I also explore how the United States and China will be competing in artificial intelligence development to become the dominant superpowers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Part 2 contains Chapters 3-7. This part will focus on why India will emerge as the next big global powerhouse after the United States and China. It will include chapters on India’s background, the fourth industrial revolution, the economy and international business, sustainable development, and geopolitics. One of the stories explored in the book includes the rise of Digital India and how the country has the largest biometric identification system, lowest data rates, and is home to a booming startup ecosystem. I will also explore India’s booming electric vehicle market, billions of dollars in renewable energy investment, and unprecedented progress in curbing poverty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Part 3 contains Chapters 8-9. This part will focus on how you can be a part of India and the world’s growth story and ways that organizations, companies, and startups will focus their efforts to support and benefit from India’s rise this decade. I will also discuss how people can succeed in the world’s next big growth market.</p>
<p> </p>

</div></div>","Story of my book
Trillion Dollar Fortune is a book about how India will join the United States and China to become the world’s third-largest economy and emerge as a leader in sustainable development this decade. The COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the world’s economies and exposed the harsh vulnerabilities in the global system. The stark differences between the developed world and developing world highlight that there is much more work to be done in global development. Through insights from leaders across business, technology, academia, governments, and nonprofit organizations, my book will help you pave an understanding of how entrepreneurship and innovation can be used to tackle urgent issues such as demographic shifts, artificial intelligence, climate change, and poverty.My name is Faeez Juneja, and I am the author of Trillion Dollar Fortune. I wrote this book because I am passionate about sustainability, technology, and globalization. I was born in India but raised in the United States for most of my life. I have moved across different cities in my life, and I have witnessed the stark contrast between the life I was living and the lives of others. My observations have also reflected on the transformative impact that technology and business have on uplifting communities, especially in India. I want to explore ways we can harness innovation to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals and build a more equitable future.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how India will be joining the United States and China to become a global power later this decade and the geopolitical, economic, environmental, and technological opportunities that a rising India will have for the world. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for business and sustainability . And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand the key trends that are shaping our collective future and how you can be a part of the new post-pandemic world that emphasizes social impact over shareholder profit.In this book, you'll learn about India's rise in global development and international business. Some of these topics include:

Why India is the fifth-largest economy in the world, how it can reach its $5 trillion target through becoming more sustainable and inclusive, and why transforming India will be the biggest business opportunity of the century. I will explore how Invest India has become the top investment promotion agency, attracting over $161 billion in foreign direct investment pipeline alone across all sectors.
How India is the world’s third-largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions but also has emerged as a global leader in renewable energy. India is the only major country in the world that remains on track to overachieve its 2°C compatible Paris Agreement climate action targets. I will explore how India can become a success story for developing countries that want to achieve economic growth while combating climate change.
The rise of the Indo-Pacific region in geopolitics and global business as the US bolsters its presence in the region by building deeper cooperation with India and countries such as Japan, Australia, and South Korea to balance China’s $1 Trillion Brick and Road Initiative.

You will love this book if you are interested in innovative solutions and shaping the world’s responses to the most urgent technological, economic, and social challenges in a global context.Trillion Dollar Fortune is a non-fiction book that speaks to international business professionals and technology enthusiasts who are looking at sustainability, India, and geopolitics for the first time.

The Book - Trillion Dollar Fortune
The book is written in 3 Parts:
Part 1 contains the Introduction and Chapters 1-2. This part will focus on exploring the global order today, the role that the US and China are playing, the critical challenges that the world faces, and the need for India to emerge as a global power. There are insights on how China emerged as the world’s largest economy by purchasing power parity in just 40 years and how the country is building a new geopolitical, economic, and technological architecture for the 21st century. I also explore how the United States and China will be competing in artificial intelligence development to become the dominant superpowers.
 
Part 2 contains Chapters 3-7. This part will focus on why India will emerge as the next big global powerhouse after the United States and China. It will include chapters on India’s background, the fourth industrial revolution, the economy and international business, sustainable development, and geopolitics. One of the stories explored in the book includes the rise of Digital India and how the country has the largest biometric identification system, lowest data rates, and is home to a booming startup ecosystem. I will also explore India’s booming electric vehicle market, billions of dollars in renewable energy investment, and unprecedented progress in curbing poverty.
 
Part 3 contains Chapters 8-9. This part will focus on how you can be a part of India and the world’s growth story and ways that organizations, companies, and startups will focus their efforts to support and benefit from India’s rise this decade. I will also discuss how people can succeed in the world’s next big growth market.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The humorous children's novel, <i>The Lockdown Letters of Professor Farnsworth Shakespeare</i>, grew out of a series of fun letters that Irfan Shah began writing for his nephews, Thomas and Louis, and niece, Anika. They were written to give the kids a giggle during lockdown. They giggled so much, Irfan decided to turn the stories into a book.</p>
<p>With the help of his partner, Tracie, Irfan also decided to take fate into his own hands and publish the book himself. To this end, both he and Tracie learned how to book-bind and made the first prototype copies at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>The story of the disaster-prone Professor is meant to provide some light relief during the grim days of lockdown, and although it is silly in the extreme, it is also hopeful, and a way of facing the troubles around us with humour and imagination.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The book has been released as an ebook for Kindle but we want to turn it into a real, physical artefact. A proper Book! We intend to do everything ourselves and to that end have learned how to bind books, both hardback and paperback.</p>
<p>We are looking to raise £10,000 to do the following:</p>
<p>1. We now need money for materials - the paper, ink, cloth, glue, mull, brushes etc that will be needed to continue.</p>
<p>2. We aim to purchase some basic equipment that will enable us to produce books at a sufficient rate. At the moment, we are improvising quite a bit, for example, we are lining up our text-blocks using a picture frame sawn in half to give us right-angles, and the books, once glued together, are pressed down with cookery books! This approach is not optimal. If we can get basic equipment - a small wooden book-press, for example, it would completely change how we worked.</p>
<p>3. We will need an ISBN number to make the physical books 'official'. That way, we can send them out for review and ask shops to stock them.</p>
<p>4. We would like to be able to fund some basic marketing of the book.</p>
<p>5. We are hoping to turn Lockdown Letters into an audio book. Any remaining funds would go into making this happen.</p>
<p>In return for your support, we have put together a series of exclusive gifts. We will add to the list as we go along and create more things. To begin with, we are offering:</p>
<p><u><strong>Exclusive Preview Copies of the Book.</strong></u></p>
<p>- <strong>Red, landscape, hardback.</strong> Signed by the Professor. (50 copies, numbered)</p>
<p>- <strong>Yellow, landscape, hardback.</strong> signed by the Professor. (3 copies, numbered)</p>
<p><u><strong>On their way:</strong></u></p>
<p><strong> - Exclusive, Professor Farnsworth Shakespeare notebook. </strong>Faux red leather cover. Blank pages and occasional printed pages (with images, quotations and surprises)</p>
<p>- <strong>Official Paperback Copy of the Book</strong> (portrait) Signed by the Professor.</p>
<p>- <strong>Handwritten thank you letter from the Professor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Original artwork by illustrator, Tracie Johnson.</strong></p>

<h3>Excerpt from 'The Lockdown Letters of Professor Farnsworth Shakespeare'</h3>
<p>.......there I was in prison. I was pacing my cell like a dangerous criminal, pacing and pacing, and growling and scowling, and leering and sneering, and movin’ and a groovin’. Eventually, a guard came and took me to the visiting room where Tracie was waiting at a table, sitting next to a very stern looking woman.<br/>“This is Cassandra Vegetable-Stew” said Tracie as she introduced me.<br/>“A double-barrelled name, eh?” I said “Very posh.”<br/>“She’s going to be representing you at the trial” said Tracie. I must have just sat there staring blankly at them because Vegetable-Stew began to explain.<br/>“You’ve been arrested, Professor. On a very serious charge of running up to people and scaring them.”<br/>“I see” I said. “I mean, I <i>know</i>. I was there.”<br/>“Well now you’re <i>here</i>. And soon you’ll be over <i>there</i>, ‘there’ being a court room with a judge who will have to decide whether to send you back to prison or let you go free.”<br/>“Hope it’s the second one!”<br/>“Well, it’s my job to try and persuade the judge to let you go. I am, what is called a defence lawyer.”<br/>“That’s great news. ......Er, just a moment...I have a question”<br/>“Go on” said Vegetable-Stew.<br/>“Well, first of all, I’m asking this for a friend, you understand, not for me. His name’s....Barnsworth....Rakeclear. Well, could you tell me – tell <i>him</i> – what would happen if, say, Barnsworth Rakeclear went into a chocolate shop and put a load of Scrummy Chewbars down his trousers and walked off with them without paying and then ate them all. I mean, if anyone said anything, I could get - <i>he</i> – he could get a defence lawyer and everything would be alright?”<br/>“No, not exactly. In fact, not at all. Defence lawyers aren’t the only kind of lawyers out there. There is another type called a prosecution lawyer and their job is to try and persuade the judge to LOCK PEOPLE UP.”<br/>“Oh, no, that’s terrible. Well, er, I’ll pass that on to old Barnsworth when I see him...I’ll tell him not to bother. That’s a shame though, I really like – I mean, he – really likes Scrummy Chewbars.<br/>“Yes. Please do let Mr. <i>Bakespeare </i>know.” Said Vegetable-Stew. And then, something else occurred to me.<br/>“Does that mean there’s a prosecution lawyer who’s going to try and persuade the judge to lock <i>me </i>up?”<br/>“Yes. There will be a prosecution lawyer at your trial.”<br/>“What? Why would someone do that? Who would do that? It must be someone who doesn’t like me or why else turn up and try and get me thrown into the clink? I know, I bet it’s Ranjit Barmiarmee, he’s always had it in for me ever since I tried to cheer him up by organising a flash mob for him at work. I mean, who doesn’t love a flashmob? I got a load of people to surprise him by pretending to be going about their day and then suddenly getting up and bursting into a song and dance right there and then, all around him:</p>
<p>‘I tell you what I want what I blinkin’ blunkin’ want<br/>So tell me what ya want what you blinkin’ blunkin’ want<br/>I really, really, really, wanna ziggazig ah....’</p>
<p>But did he appreciate it? No, all I got was ‘moan, moan, moan, this is inappropriate, whinge, whinge, I’m trying to conduct a funeral here, yaketty yak yak.’”<br/>“No, no, no. A prosecution lawyer is a trained legal expert and it just so happens that their job is to argue that the person on trial should be found guilty and LOCKED UP.”<br/>“Why? What kind of sicko does that?”<br/>“It’s just a job, Professor.”<br/>“Well, I think it stinks.”<br/>“Professor, we seem to be missing the point here. Could I ask you to focus?”<br/>“Alright” I said, and I leant forward, narrowed my eyes and stared at her very, very carefully.<br/>“...on the case. Could we focus on your case? Could we talk about what we are going to do try and keep you out of prison?”<br/>“That’s a good idea” I said and relaxed my eyes.<br/>“Now, the situation is this” continued Vegetable-Stew. “You’ve been accused of running up to people and scaring them. The maximum sentence for such a crime is two years in the clink.”<br/>“Two years!”<br/>“So, we have to come up with a good defence.”<br/>“I’m sorry” I said, “but this is not the time to be playing football.”<br/>“No, a ‘defence’ is an argument for why you should be set free. So, Professor, why should you be let free?”<br/>“Well, that’s obvious, isn’t it? I mean....well, if you look at it this way....er, after all is said and done, and not to put too fine a point on it.......it all comes down to, well, it’s just a matter of....and furthermore, I think you’ll find........ er.....Tracie? Any ideas?”<br/>Tracie, who had been flicking through a TV guide and circling programmes to watch, looked up.<br/>“That’s a very good question” she said. There was then a short silence.<br/>“And what’s the very good answer?” I asked.<br/>Tracie put down the TV guide and sighed heavily.<br/>“I suppose you shouldn’t be put in jail because you didn’t mean anyone any harm. You were just being a bit of a plonker.”<br/>“Brilliant!” I said.<br/>“Yes” said Vegetable-Stew, “Tracie has hit the nail on the head. There was no malice intended.”<br/>“Exactly. There was no-one called Alice there. That’s right.”<br/>“No, not Alice - <i>Malice</i>. It means ‘bad intentions’. There were no bad intentions. You weren’t trying to do anything bad, were you?”<br/>“No! Not at all, never.” I cried. “No malice. No malice intended, m’lud.”<br/>“And so, with that in mind, I have obtained several witness statements to support our ‘he’s a plonker’ argument. Now, Professor, before you ask what a- ”<br/>“What’s a witness statement?”<br/>“- witness statement is, let me tell you. A witness is somebody who has seen or heard something useful to the case. A statement is the description of what that witness heard or saw. So, I have rounded up lots of people who have heard or seen you being a bit of a plonker. They are the witnesses. And these -” she took out a big pile of papers “are their statements. On each piece of paper someone has written about what a ridiculous spectacle you have made of yourself at some time or another.”<br/>“Good stuff!” I said, “And how many of them are there?”<br/>“Well, normally we like to get about three or four witness statements. However, fortunately for you, there are plenty of people who have seen you being a plonker.”<br/>“And how many’s that, <i>exactly</i>?”<br/>“Four hundred and twenty-seven” said Vegetable-Stew.<br/>“Okay, okay. But I still have one concern. I’m not sure I’m happy about you calling me a plonker in front of a judge. Have you considered a different defence argument? Like, ‘He’s far too brilliant to go to jail’ or cute? I am pretty cute.”<br/>“Professor” said Vegetable-Stew slowly, as if she were explaining something to a child rather than a brilliant-novelwriting-crimesolving-songsinging- inventionmaking-soulsearching-prisonsurviving-goldpantwearing genius.<br/>“Believe me. This is your <i>only</i> hope.”</p>
<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Irfan Shah is a writer more usually involved with film history. He was the co-writer of the BAFTA-long-listed feature length documentary, <i>The First Film</i>, and has written for publications such as <i>History Today, TIME (Online), TheTimes Educational Supplement</i> and <i>Cineaste.</i></p>
<p><i>The Lockdown Letters</i> is his first - but not his last - children's book. He is currently writing a sequel and the Professor's adventures look set to continue!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The advantage of this project is that, because we are making the books ourselves, we are not reliant upon any other person or business.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of this is the fact that everything rests on our shoulders and is reliant on our good health etc. We will factor this is in to our campaign by creating small stockpiles of gifts to ensure we are able to supply our supporters. Because the books are hand made, and not part of a large order waiting to be completed by a third party, every contribution will result in an immediate success - a finished book.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you do not want to purchase a book, please do tell anyone you think might enjoy it, about what we are doing. Word of mouth is incredibly important to us.</p>

The book has been released as an ebook for Kindle but we want to turn it into a real, physical artefact. A proper Book! We intend to do everything ourselves and to that end have learned how to bind books, both hardback and paperback.
We are looking to raise £10,000 to do the following:
1. We now need money for materials - the paper, ink, cloth, glue, mull, brushes etc that will be needed to continue.
2. We aim to purchase some basic equipment that will enable us to produce books at a sufficient rate. At the moment, we are improvising quite a bit, for example, we are lining up our text-blocks using a picture frame sawn in half to give us right-angles, and the books, once glued together, are pressed down with cookery books! This approach is not optimal. If we can get basic equipment - a small wooden book-press, for example, it would completely change how we worked.
3. We will need an ISBN number to make the physical books 'official'. That way, we can send them out for review and ask shops to stock them.
4. We would like to be able to fund some basic marketing of the book.
5. We are hoping to turn Lockdown Letters into an audio book. Any remaining funds would go into making this happen.
In return for your support, we have put together a series of exclusive gifts. We will add to the list as we go along and create more things. To begin with, we are offering:
Exclusive Preview Copies of the Book.
- Red, landscape, hardback. Signed by the Professor. (50 copies, numbered)
- Yellow, landscape, hardback. signed by the Professor. (3 copies, numbered)
On their way:
 - Exclusive, Professor Farnsworth Shakespeare notebook. Faux red leather cover. Blank pages and occasional printed pages (with images, quotations and surprises)
- Official Paperback Copy of the Book (portrait) Signed by the Professor.
- Handwritten thank you letter from the Professor.
- Original artwork by illustrator, Tracie Johnson.

Excerpt from 'The Lockdown Letters of Professor Farnsworth Shakespeare'
.......there I was in prison. I was pacing my cell like a dangerous criminal, pacing and pacing, and growling and scowling, and leering and sneering, and movin’ and a groovin’. Eventually, a guard came and took me to the visiting room where Tracie was waiting at a table, sitting next to a very stern looking woman.“This is Cassandra Vegetable-Stew” said Tracie as she introduced me.“A double-barrelled name, eh?” I said “Very posh.”“She’s going to be representing you at the trial” said Tracie. I must have just sat there staring blankly at them because Vegetable-Stew began to explain.“You’ve been arrested, Professor. On a very serious charge of running up to people and scaring them.”“I see” I said. “I mean, I know. I was there.”“Well now you’re here. And soon you’ll be over there, ‘there’ being a court room with a judge who will have to decide whether to send you back to prison or let you go free.”“Hope it’s the second one!”“Well, it’s my job to try and persuade the judge to let you go. I am, what is called a defence lawyer.”“That’s great news. ......Er, just a moment...I have a question”“Go on” said Vegetable-Stew.“Well, first of all, I’m asking this for a friend, you understand, not for me. His name’s....Barnsworth....Rakeclear. Well, could you tell me – tell him – what would happen if, say, Barnsworth Rakeclear went into a chocolate shop and put a load of Scrummy Chewbars down his trousers and walked off with them without paying and then ate them all. I mean, if anyone said anything, I could get - he – he could get a defence lawyer and everything would be alright?”“No, not exactly. In fact, not at all. Defence lawyers aren’t the only kind of lawyers out there. There is another type called a prosecution lawyer and their job is to try and persuade the judge to LOCK PEOPLE UP.”“Oh, no, that’s terrible. Well, er, I’ll pass that on to old Barnsworth when I see him...I’ll tell him not to bother. That’s a shame though, I really like – I mean, he – really likes Scrummy Chewbars.“Yes. Please do let Mr. Bakespeare know.” Said Vegetable-Stew. And then, something else occurred to me.“Does that mean there’s a prosecution lawyer who’s going to try and persuade the judge to lock me up?”“Yes. There will be a prosecution lawyer at your trial.”“What? Why would someone do that? Who would do that? It must be someone who doesn’t like me or why else turn up and try and get me thrown into the clink? I know, I bet it’s Ranjit Barmiarmee, he’s always had it in for me ever since I tried to cheer him up by organising a flash mob for him at work. I mean, who doesn’t love a flashmob? I got a load of people to surprise him by pretending to be going about their day and then suddenly getting up and bursting into a song and dance right there and then, all around him:
‘I tell you what I want what I blinkin’ blunkin’ wantSo tell me what ya want what you blinkin’ blunkin’ wantI really, really, really, wanna ziggazig ah....’
But did he appreciate it? No, all I got was ‘moan, moan, moan, this is inappropriate, whinge, whinge, I’m trying to conduct a funeral here, yaketty yak yak.’”“No, no, no. A prosecution lawyer is a trained legal expert and it just so happens that their job is to argue that the person on trial should be found guilty and LOCKED UP.”“Why? What kind of sicko does that?”“It’s just a job, Professor.”“Well, I think it stinks.”“Professor, we seem to be missing the point here. Could I ask you to focus?”“Alright” I said, and I leant forward, narrowed my eyes and stared at her very, very carefully.“...on the case. Could we focus on your case? Could we talk about what we are going to do try and keep you out of prison?”“That’s a good idea” I said and relaxed my eyes.“Now, the situation is this” continued Vegetable-Stew. “You’ve been accused of running up to people and scaring them. The maximum sentence for such a crime is two years in the clink.”“Two years!”“So, we have to come up with a good defence.”“I’m sorry” I said, “but this is not the time to be playing football.”“No, a ‘defence’ is an argument for why you should be set free. So, Professor, why should you be let free?”“Well, that’s obvious, isn’t it? I mean....well, if you look at it this way....er, after all is said and done, and not to put too fine a point on it.......it all comes down to, well, it’s just a matter of....and furthermore, I think you’ll find........ er.....Tracie? Any ideas?”Tracie, who had been flicking through a TV guide and circling programmes to watch, looked up.“That’s a very good question” she said. There was then a short silence.“And what’s the very good answer?” I asked.Tracie put down the TV guide and sighed heavily.“I suppose you shouldn’t be put in jail because you didn’t mean anyone any harm. You were just being a bit of a plonker.”“Brilliant!” I said.“Yes” said Vegetable-Stew, “Tracie has hit the nail on the head. There was no malice intended.”“Exactly. There was no-one called Alice there. That’s right.”“No, not Alice - Malice. It means ‘bad intentions’. There were no bad intentions. You weren’t trying to do anything bad, were you?”“No! Not at all, never.” I cried. “No malice. No malice intended, m’lud.”“And so, with that in mind, I have obtained several witness statements to support our ‘he’s a plonker’ argument. Now, Professor, before you ask what a- ”“What’s a witness statement?”“- witness statement is, let me tell you. A witness is somebody who has seen or heard something useful to the case. A statement is the description of what that witness heard or saw. So, I have rounded up lots of people who have heard or seen you being a bit of a plonker. They are the witnesses. And these -” she took out a big pile of papers “are their statements. On each piece of paper someone has written about what a ridiculous spectacle you have made of yourself at some time or another.”“Good stuff!” I said, “And how many of them are there?”“Well, normally we like to get about three or four witness statements. However, fortunately for you, there are plenty of people who have seen you being a plonker.”“And how many’s that, exactly?”“Four hundred and twenty-seven” said Vegetable-Stew.“Okay, okay. But I still have one concern. I’m not sure I’m happy about you calling me a plonker in front of a judge. Have you considered a different defence argument? Like, ‘He’s far too brilliant to go to jail’ or cute? I am pretty cute.”“Professor” said Vegetable-Stew slowly, as if she were explaining something to a child rather than a brilliant-novelwriting-crimesolving-songsinging- inventionmaking-soulsearching-prisonsurviving-goldpantwearing genius.“Believe me. This is your only hope.”
About the Author
Irfan Shah is a writer more usually involved with film history. He was the co-writer of the BAFTA-long-listed feature length documentary, The First Film, and has written for publications such as History Today, TIME (Online), TheTimes Educational Supplement and Cineaste.
The Lockdown Letters is his first - but not his last - children's book. He is currently writing a sequel and the Professor's adventures look set to continue!

Risks & Challenges
The advantage of this project is that, because we are making the books ourselves, we are not reliant upon any other person or business.
The disadvantage of this is the fact that everything rests on our shoulders and is reliant on our good health etc. We will factor this is in to our campaign by creating small stockpiles of gifts to ensure we are able to supply our supporters. Because the books are hand made, and not part of a large order waiting to be completed by a third party, every contribution will result in an immediate success - a finished book.

Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you do not want to purchase a book, please do tell anyone you think might enjoy it, about what we are doing. Word of mouth is incredibly important to us.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

My first deck, the Crow Tarot (winner of two 2019 CARTA awards), began my journey as a Tarot illustrator. However, I have been an artist for as long as I can recall. As per my mother, as I was too young to remember this event, apparently, at a young age, I went door to door trying to sell my drawings. Even back then, I knew I didn't want to make art as a hobby, I wanted art to be my career. This is my purpose; this is what I am here to do. It only took 45 some odd years to realize that my passion sits in the world of Tarot as I not only get to make the art I love—I also see how it benefits others. It's not just a pretty picture on the wall; it is a tool that brings clarity and joy, and hopefully, some appreciation for the artwork itself. I thoughtfully design each of my decks to be intuitive, and you will find the energy of each is unique. My latest deck began a month into our Shelter in Place order. I am a single mom of a kiddo who is now home from school for the rest of the year. The Guardian of the Night brings an energy of hope, a sense of sadness at times, and a recognition for what has been lost. It is very much a journey in the making. </p><p>I hope you will join me on this trip as I think we could all use the company. <br/>Peace,<br/>MJ</p></div>","About the deck:Because The Guardian of the Night is based on the traditional messages of the Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot, you will find this deck easy to connect with right from the box. Although I may tell the story a little differently, the underlying message and energy will be one that is comforting and familiar. 
Based on the traditional Rider-Waite-Smith card meanings, this deck will be easy to use for new Tarot readers as well as an interesting alternative for professional or well-seasoned tarot readers

You can move the cards around, stack them, swish them about until you feel that little tug that tells you to pull. https://www.guardianofthenight.comPlease note that this little extra project is still a work in progress, however with your support I will be able to put the entire deck online including the messages.  Project Progress:Expect updates. I send out updates for my projects about once a week. This is my fourth Tarot card crowdfunding campaign and I know keeping everyone updated is essential. If you are not signed up on Indiegogo for updates, please sign up to my site (no spam, just updates) - sign up at www.mjcullinane.com/signup I anticipate this deck shipping in September and will keep you posted along the way as we inch closer to that time.  About the artist:Hello, I'm MJ, and this is my fourth Tarot deck. My first deck, the Crow Tarot (winner of two 2019 CARTA awards), began my journey as a Tarot illustrator. However, I have been an artist for as long as I can recall. As per my mother, as I was too young to remember this event, apparently, at a young age, I went door to door trying to sell my drawings. Even back then, I knew I didn't want to make art as a hobby, I wanted art to be my career. This is my purpose; this is what I am here to do. It only took 45 some odd years to realize that my passion sits in the world of Tarot as I not only get to make the art I love—I also see how it benefits others. It's not just a pretty picture on the wall; it is a tool that brings clarity and joy, and hopefully, some appreciation for the artwork itself. I thoughtfully design each of my decks to be intuitive, and you will find the energy of each is unique. My latest deck began a month into our Shelter in Place order. I am a single mom of a kiddo who is now home from school for the rest of the year. The Guardian of the Night brings an energy of hope, a sense of sadness at times, and a recognition for what has been lost. It is very much a journey in the making. I hope you will join me on this trip as I think we could all use the company. Peace,MJ",9.0,1,"4 Campaigns

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>The Pursuit of Purpose </i>is a book that calls out the empty promises found in the cultural norm of living for our own happiness. A better pursuit exists that can actually lead to true fulfillment, and it begins by discovering our purpose.<br/><br/>My name is Tyler Wedell, and I am the author of <i>The Pursuit of Purpose</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to help people find and live out their life’s calling. After reaching a low point in high school, I found myself depressed and questioning my existence. But when God showed me that my life had a purpose, everything changed. I wanted to give others the same opportunity I experienced to live for something greater.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover there is more to life than simply chasing happiness. We each have a purpose ingrained in the fabric of our lives, and the world is waiting for us to share it. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for living life with meaning. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you discover the unique purpose you have and how to live it out.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn where to look for clues to find your calling and how to have the faith needed to pursue it. You'll hear stories about...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Michael Phelps</strong>, the most decorated Olympian of all time, who found himself at the lowest moment of his life after he had accomplished everything he wanted. But winning gold medals and retiring at a young age didn’t compare to the fulfillment he found in discovering his life had a purpose that was so much bigger.</li>
<li>
<strong>Adam Braun</strong>, who started the non-profit Pencils of Promise, which builds schools around the world. After a trip overseas, he discovered a desire to help poverty stricken kids get access to an education. His passion began to point him to a purpose he couldn’t turn away from, one that truly made him feel alive.</li>
<li>
<strong>Rebekah Gregory</strong>, one of the survivors from the Boston Marathon bombing, who shares how the deep pain of getting blown up and losing her leg actually led to a significant platform for purpose. Finding the meaning through her trauma has allowed her to not only take back her life, but helped change the lives of others along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you are looking for something more than the endless pursuit of happiness, want to live a life of meaning and fulfillment, or if you know you have a purpose but aren’t sure how to find it.<br/><br/><i>The Pursuit of Purpose</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to students and adults who have a desire to live for something more but aren’t sure what it is and want to look at finding purpose in a new way.</p>
<h3>The Book - The Pursuit of Purpose</h3>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-4. This section calls out the empty promises of pursing happiness and lays the foundation needed to build purpose upon. It looks at the power purpose can have and the mindset we need to be able to realize its potential. The last thing we need is something else to add to our to-do list — our lives are busy enough. By realizing that we already hold within us immense purpose, we can step into the mindset to start living with that purpose instead of simply striving after something new.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2 </strong>contains chapters 5-9. This section lays out the pillars of purpose within our lives that allow us to identify the clues that point to our calling. It will provide practical tools to begin to realize the meaning our lives hold, which is waiting to be unleashed upon the world. There is a reason we have certain passions, talents, experiences, and opportunities. When we explore each one, we will begin to see a common theme emerge that will lay out a clear path to our purpose.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 </strong>contains chapters 10-12. This section explores the faith needed to live out our calling in a way that will actually sustain us and lead to true fulfillment. Many good intentions die before they see the light of day. Discovering our purpose is only just the beginning. Having the faith to see we are all connected to a bigger story, combined with the ability to take action and stay present, will allow us the capacity to see our calling through and make a difference in the world.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>

Can obstetric practices coexist and collaborate with midwifery and ancestral practices? Women, birthing people, in many cases face obstetric violence and are victims of claims that diminish their will and inner wisdom of giving birth the way they choose. ""To facilitate this better communication and women-centred care, the best recommendation in the new WHO guidance is the collaborative midwifery-obstetrician model whereby care is provided primarily by midwives. The Lancet Series shows midwifery care to be associated with more vaginal births, safer outcomes, positive maternal experiences, and lower costs, and an accompanying Comment clearly supports the role of midwives in reducing caesarean section use.""  The Lancet Journal How, where, when and with whom our female ancestors gave birth and are there ancestral birth giving practices still alive around the world? One of my  main concerns around  the dehumanization of birth giving, is the C-section rates that are raising exponentially globally having a negative effect on the overall health of humanity.""In the USA, 20 years ago the C-section rate was 18%, now it's 32%. So the question is what drove that increase? Do all these women need it? In some communities in Sweden the C-section rate is only 5%. But in others parts of the world, it's 50%""  Quote from the Book, Your Baby's Microbiome.“I believe that the human oxytocin system - oxytocin being the hormone of love, fundamental to birth and bonding, even in adulthood - is growing weaker. The future of the human capacity to give birth is at risk,” Michel Odent said in a contribution to Antonella Gambotto-Burk's new book, Mama: Love, Motherhood and Revolution.   MY GRAIN OF SAND My intention to write the book, “Birth as You Please”,  is to create a reference point where twenty one mothers from around the world can connect through their individual birth stories in a creative manner and be inspired to become agents of paradigm change in the way they birth their children, in their own individual cultural, social contexts, remembering and reclaiming the right to birth as they please, safely and respected.Women will learn from how other women carry their babies in the womb and how they give birth to them? What if in Bolivia, China or India, Canada they share the same “threat” of the C-section epidemic? And what if birthing with midwives, vaginally and naturally free of epidurals and antibiotics, is a conscious act to rescue the wisdom of our ancestors and to give the best possible entry of our babies to life.When I was pregnant it was the birth stories I read at Ina May's Gaskin Book ""Guide to Childbirth"" that  inspired me to the decision to give a non medicated vaginal birth with a midwife, at Toronto birth center. I believe and trust the empowering effect of storytelling. The book ""Birth As You Please""  is my intention to inspire soon to be mothers to ask more questions on how, where, when and with whom they birth their children and revive some of the ancestral birth giving practices.WHERE AM I NOW?     I am now In La Paz, Bolivia with my family, connecting with women and their birth stories. I am gradually finding my way to traditional birthing experiences at rural areas, as well as collecting birthing testimonies from urban women who are experiencing  C-section as their sole birthing choice. FUTURE VISION: My objective in the long run is to publish the Book ""Birth As You Please"" in all the  countries and languages where the twenty one women will share their birth stories from, so that an international dialogue can take place on what does it really mean to ""Birth As You Please"".I am also planning to hold various exhibitions of the twenty one pregnancy portraits I will be creating for the book, advocating for humanizing birth practices and rescuing ancestral wisdom.                                                                                                                                    TIMELINE AND FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS1. Once the crowdfunding campaign is completed, I will be traveling to meet in person the women who will participate for the creation of the book, ""Birth As You Please"". The countries I will be visiting to record the birth stories depends on the crowdfunding amount reached.  In the box above you can have a look and idea at the financial projections and the corresponding countries.                                                        * In the case where less than 5.000$ will be collected, then a presentation of Birth Art and Birth stories will be created at a leaflet format, where the number of portraits and birth stories will be reduced to only 5.2. Once I have collected the twenty birth stories from a diverse group of women, the creative process of painting the pregnancy portraits will take place .3.Once the pregnancy portraits are ready, then I will be editing the birth stories and translating them in English and Spanish.4. The book ""Birth As You Please"", will be ready around February 2020. It will be printed in English and Spanish in La Paz, Bolivia at the printing company, Inventa Imprenta.

The most important goal is to share the gospel with the children of Bataambang and teach them about the Jesus' love through a vacation Bible school and witness to them the good news. 2. We also plan to serve the children and the surrounding community with wellness checkups as well as building a chicken coop to help support and maintain the physical health of the children. 3. Another important aspect of our mission is to help educate helpers and mentors about the Bible and to accommodate different learning styles for the children. 4. We are also seeking to set the groundwork for future mission trips to CambodiaOther Ways You Can HelpThere's nothing more powerful than prayer. Your prayers and support will help me and my team to keep our focus on our main goals and allow us to maintain the importance of the purpose of our mission trip and the reasons for it. If God's love is for anybody anywhere, it's for everybody everywhere",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

developing high quality, faith-based animation for churches, schools and
families. 
The main goal of the Ministry is to animate the entire Bible,
from cover to cover with no part left out. We indent to have the animation
translated into different languages, and distribute it to the world for free, for all. (allowing anyone to get their hands on a copy) 
And so to start this off we now bring you, The Animated Bible: Proverbs the Book of
Wisdom. 
                      This will be a 3D computer animated film of ‘The Book of Proverbs’’.
The aim is to not be an adaptation of plot or dialogue, instead we want to depict the Bible
accurately, to create a Word-For-Word animated performance of ‘The Book
of Proverbs’ for Children and Adults. what you will see in the animation will
go closely along with what you read in the actual written words in the Bible,
sticking as close to the text as possible. 
The Fool_3D character design
3D character designFor a few years, we have been praying a lot about this
project and how to make it happen. We are passionate about the Bible and want
to use are skills to serve the whole body of Christ across denominations.
The purpose of Proverbs is really a book of moral
instructions on everyday living. We decided to start off with is book, for the
very same reasons given in the first seven verses which form the prologue where
the reader is called to serious study for their own benefit. In just a few
brief words, you are introduced to:                                    (1) The genre of this literature, in verse.1 
                              (2) The direct and clear purpose, in verses 2-6 
                                   (3) The main important motto in verse.7
We want to create an educational tool that speaks to our
current and future cultures. The Simple_3D character designThe Scorner_Concept ArtTitle_Concept Art
3D computer
animation is an expensive and long process. 
We will be animating the entire Bible over a few years, however will be releasing
the animation in a series of chapters. We aim to continue production on the
book of Proverbs as of April 2014, and have it completed by December 2014. Folly_3D character design

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Who am I?</b></p>
<p>I’m Laya Saul, an
award-winning author (Mom’s Choice Gold is my favorite). My goals in publishing
are creating books that make the world better by helping people on their
journey in life. Life experiences and a master’s degree in psychology helped me
write a self-help book for teens.  Being
a mom (and now a grandmother!) opened my heart to create this whimsical book
based on the way I put my children to sleep when they were little. (The title
comes from the way my father told my children he loved them. Though you can’t
hear his tone, the blessing is there!) I’m motivated to publish this book for
the little ones in my life and I’ve already gotten the feedback that there are
others who want it for the kids in their lives too. </p>
<p>I intentionally did
not use human images in this book because I didn’t want skin color, ethnicity,
age or gender to limit who could relate to the images. It’s not a parent to a
child because not everyone who reads this book has her parent reading it. It
could be a sibling, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or godparent reading this story.
Children can project themselves into the story in whatever way their
imaginations will delight. </p><p>Want to know more about me?

<p><b>How your investment
will be used: </b></p>
<p>Your contribution to
this campaign will help cover the publication costs and <b><i>get this sweet book into your
home!</i></b> </p>
<p>Publishing costs
include illustrations, typesetting, printing and shipping. Your copy or copies
of the book will go to print no matter what; of course the more backers, the
more production costs will go down. I aim to produce the finest quality books
that the funding collected provides. If the funding exceeds the goal and I can
go into offset printing (instead of POD) there will be more copies to donate.
With funding of $5000 I will donate a minimum of 50 books to children’s
organizations and/or needy families. With funding at $7000 a minimum of 100
books will be donated.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp;
What You Get</b></p>
<p>A few more details:</p>
<p>•<span>  </span>Whatever level you choose to participate
will help cover prepublication costs and the bare bones of POD (print on
demand) publishing. If donations exceed the initial campaign, I may be able go
to offset printing and that means I can print more books of consistent high
quality.  </p>
<p>•<span>  </span>I know the young children who you give this
book to will enjoy reading it over and over. The e-book will be fun, but the
print book even more so as you wind down a busy day with your little ones off
line. Choose the print to hang on the wall that keeps the love and adventure in
the background all the time. </p>
<p>•<span>  </span>In the event that we don’t reach the entire
goal, we’ll print your copy of the book and fulfill your perks no matter what,
so you can enhance the journey with those you love.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Kids don’t remember

Who am I?
I’m Laya Saul, an
award-winning author (Mom’s Choice Gold is my favorite). My goals in publishing
are creating books that make the world better by helping people on their
journey in life. Life experiences and a master’s degree in psychology helped me
write a self-help book for teens.  Being
a mom (and now a grandmother!) opened my heart to create this whimsical book
based on the way I put my children to sleep when they were little. (The title
comes from the way my father told my children he loved them. Though you can’t
hear his tone, the blessing is there!) I’m motivated to publish this book for
the little ones in my life and I’ve already gotten the feedback that there are
others who want it for the kids in their lives too. 
I intentionally did
not use human images in this book because I didn’t want skin color, ethnicity,
age or gender to limit who could relate to the images. It’s not a parent to a
child because not everyone who reads this book has her parent reading it. It
could be a sibling, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or godparent reading this story.
Children can project themselves into the story in whatever way their
imaginations will delight. Want to know more about me? Check out my websites:http://www.auntlaya.comhttp://www.nurturingwomen.com 
How your investment
will be used: 
Your contribution to
this campaign will help cover the publication costs and get this sweet book into your
home! 
Publishing costs
include illustrations, typesetting, printing and shipping. Your copy or copies
of the book will go to print no matter what; of course the more backers, the
more production costs will go down. I aim to produce the finest quality books
that the funding collected provides. If the funding exceeds the goal and I can
go into offset printing (instead of POD) there will be more copies to donate.
With funding of $5000 I will donate a minimum of 50 books to children’s
organizations and/or needy families. With funding at $7000 a minimum of 100
books will be donated.
What We Need &
What You Get
A few more details:
•  Whatever level you choose to participate
will help cover prepublication costs and the bare bones of POD (print on
demand) publishing. If donations exceed the initial campaign, I may be able go
to offset printing and that means I can print more books of consistent high
quality.  
•  I know the young children who you give this
book to will enjoy reading it over and over. The e-book will be fun, but the
print book even more so as you wind down a busy day with your little ones off
line. Choose the print to hang on the wall that keeps the love and adventure in
the background all the time. 
•  In the event that we don’t reach the entire
goal, we’ll print your copy of the book and fulfill your perks no matter what,
so you can enhance the journey with those you love.

The Impact
Kids don’t remember
much from their first formative years but what they see and hear will still have
a big impact over their lifetime.
•  Sweet “love notes” like I Love You So Much will anchor the
message over and over. We all have rough days but how wonderful to have the
support, even in the simplest of ways, to bring us back to center and the
essential love we want to give.
•  I’ve told teens reading my first book, You Don’t Have to Learn Everything the Hard
Way, to think of it as a “love note” from my heart to theirs. There really
is power in the written word. Caring is a soothing balm in a world full of
difficulties.
•  I love connecting, so feel free to contact
me through this campaign or on www.KadimaPress.com with any questions.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest risk with
this project is all mine because I will do all the ordering and make sure you
get the reward you choose with a blessing. Unless there is some act of G.d that
is out of my control, you’ll get the perk you choose. I’ll keep you posted
along the way.

Other Ways You Can

that extend back to 2011, a year in which I unflinchingly questioned my
identity as a Latino. <i>Catracho</i> is
a term used broadly for people of Honduran heritage and has a rich history
going back to a time when the United States wanted to acquire new territories in Central
America. This tension between Honduras and the U.S. informs most of my work.</p>
<p>I came to the
United States when I was 9, but due to an oversight in my visa, I remained in
the country past the time authorized; thus, I became illegal. As someone who has struggled with his immigrant-queer identity,
I ended up silencing so many aspects of my life through religious fanaticism,
violence upon my body, and shame. I tried to disassociate myself from my
background when memories became a source of pain, alienation, and guilt. Years later,
while teaching in South Florida, I was able to heal with the help of friends
and family. Since then, I have been writing on what I have learned throughout this journey. In a way, writing has given me a second chance at life.</p>
<p>While <i>Catracho</i> explores my challenges as an immigrant (I grew up in Allapattah, a very impoverished neighborhood in
Miami), this project cannot exist without (re)considering my place of birth:
Tegucigalpa, Honduras. For a quick glance at the overwhelming amount of
violence that has plagued Honduras and my family, the U.S. Department of State has created the Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC), which recently
published the ""<a href=""https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=17494"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Honduras 2015 Crime and
Safety Report</span></a>."" Last year, the Pew Research Center also

immigration [to the U.S.]</a>,"" looking at some of the prime
reasons Hondurans flee the country.</p>

poems in your inbox and updates about the progress of my project during the
residency.

provided. Each week you will also receive 2 new poems in your inbox and updates
about the progress of my project during the residency.




OR $250: Do you have a document you need to translate from
English to Spanish, or from Spanish to English? I have experience translating

Students are energized and inspired by the application of writing skills and

<p>Imagine a world where love was the ruling emotion. I am not talking about our romantic notion of love, but a pure heart centered way of being that encourages a creative, loving solution to all of life's little obstacles. Yes, it is possible to live from ""LOVE"" and joyfully support all of the people you interact with on a daily basis. I personally know of at least one place on earth where this social dynamic actually exists.</p>
<p>Let me tell you about it...</p>
<p>A little more than two years ago, I travelled to a small village south of Iquitos, Peru to spend time meditating on the purpose of life. Fifty-two days after stepping into the mysterious Amazonian Rainforest, I emerged full of life, love, vitality and ready to share my newly discovered happiness with anyone who would listen. For the first time in my life I had found true peace.</p>
<p>Working under the protective eye of indigenous shaman Adela Navas and her son Jose, I learned to traverse the exciting landscape of an ethereal spirit world known only to a few gifted shaman. </p>

</div></div>","Why is This Project Important?
Imagine a world where love was the ruling emotion. I am not talking about our romantic notion of love, but a pure heart centered way of being that encourages a creative, loving solution to all of life's little obstacles. Yes, it is possible to live from ""LOVE"" and joyfully support all of the people you interact with on a daily basis. I personally know of at least one place on earth where this social dynamic actually exists.
Let me tell you about it...
A little more than two years ago, I travelled to a small village south of Iquitos, Peru to spend time meditating on the purpose of life. Fifty-two days after stepping into the mysterious Amazonian Rainforest, I emerged full of life, love, vitality and ready to share my newly discovered happiness with anyone who would listen. For the first time in my life I had found true peace.
Working under the protective eye of indigenous shaman Adela Navas and her son Jose, I learned to traverse the exciting landscape of an ethereal spirit world known only to a few gifted shaman. 
After publishing a full account of my Amazonian adventure in 'Journey Beyond Words' I vowed to return to the rainforest, continue my studies with the shaman and publish another book chock full of life altering experiences.
This is your chance to help make my dream come true and share this rare gift of shamanic wisdom with the world.
A final note for anyone who would like to take on a larger role and head up part of this project, please send me your email address and how you will be contributing. I will assign that role to you and add you as part of the team.

We have reduced the required funding to succeed in our mission to $40,000 or R400,000 because we will only contest the national ballot - NOT the 9 different provinces. We are almost there - please continue to support this critical funding initiative for the people of South Africa. Thanks to this crowd funding site for the UBUNTU Party, we have managed to raise the necessary deposit of $20,000 / R200,000 to participate in the South African Elections on 7 May 2014. We borrowed this money and the cheque was delivered on the 12th March to
 the IEC and will secure the UBUNTU Party place on the Ballot for the 
National Assembly - we are aiming for 4 seats in Parliament - with your 
help this is very achievable. But we will need continued support to pay for the media and advertising campaign that will inform the people of our presence. So we need to raise a total of $40,000 by the 24th March 2014. Please share this initiative with everyone who is passionate about human rights and human sovereignty. The UBUNTU Party represents these rights and so much more for the people who believe that we are evolving towards higher consciousness as a species.<br/><br/><b>OUR ACTIONS OF THE PAST</b><br/>
Michael Tellinger and The UBUNTU Party has been active in the Supreme Court of Johannesburg since 2011. His actions have exposed the criminal activities of the banksters in South Africa and shown the people how the private banks, together with the SOUTH AFRICAN RESERVE BANK, control our government and dictate the economic policy to the people, enslaving every single one of us with their private money. The barrier to entry in these elections is a clear indication how the bankers and the government use money to manipulate, what should be free elections in South Africa. Together with Scott Cundill from the New Economic Rights Alliance, and others who have taken on the banks, our collective actions have resulted in a dramatic drop in legal actions against the people by the banks - and at least one critical adaptation to the High Court Rules, that will benefit the people.<br/><br/>Our full philosophy is outlined in detail in the UBUNTU Contributionism 
book. Please find it on our website - <a href=""http://www.ubuntuparty.org.za"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ubuntuparty.org.za</a> <br/>The book is the main source of funding for the UBUNTU movement and party. I will outline our manifesto in brief below. <br/><br/><b>THE UBUNTU MANIFESTO</b> -<b><u>  A Blueprint For Human Prosperity </u></b>
<p>The UBUNTU movement is a movement of unity and higher consciousness, allowing people to move from divided communities driven by competition, greed and money, to communities that live in united harmony of cooperation - creating abundance for all on every level of human endeavour - without the ultimate need of money - but rather the simple principles of Contributionism - where everyone uses their god-given talents or acquired skills to benefit everyone in their community. The UBUNTU philosophy allows people to move from communities driven by money, greed and corporate control, to communities driven by people, their talents and passion for life.<br/></p><p>We, the people, have appointed
the politicians as our servants to do the best they can for us - the people. The politicians and the
government have failed us dramatically on every level. They have betrayed the
dream of Nelson Mandela and many other people of integrity who dedicated their
lives to our freedom. Today, we face a greater threat than any other threat we
have faced before. The threat of absolute enslavement by those who control the
global economy and the financial systems. We recognise that money has been introduced to the human race by a small powerful group of banking families as a tool of absolute enslavement. These powerful banking families control every crack and crevice of human activity. They have taken control of our water supply, food supply, energy, health, education and even spiritual evolution. This cannot continue. </p><p>Ubuntu is 
passionate about freeing up the scientific community to invent and 
create, delivering alternative free energy to the people, restructuring 
the entire education system to suit the people and not corporations, 
turning hospitals into true places of healing, ensuring that the farmers
 are in control of food production instead of GMO giants like Monsanto, 
and decentralizing government so that the people can govern themselves 
in
their own communities.<br/></p><p>

<p><strong>What is the </strong><strong><em>to cure: </em></strong><strong>Project About?</strong></p>
<p><em>to cure:</em> is the beginning of an extensive multimedia project documenting the state of artisanal and craft food production in the United States.  It's a place for telling and sharing stories, for preserving knowledge.  There are people out there, more each day, hand-crafting the things we eat.  Each of these artisans incorporate ingredients and techniques which our conventional food system so frequently overlooks:  Time, Passion, Integrity.  For these craftsmen, these curators of food culture, making is about more than making money.  It’s about doing the right thing, in the right way.</p>
<p>Once, long ago, we would spend our evenings sitting around the fire, eating together, and sharing stories.  Rather than epic sagas filled with heroes and villains, victory and defeat, love and tragedy, we suspect that, more often than not, these were tales of life’s little labors.  How raw materials were discovered, gathered, and through the magic of human handiwork, transmutated and given new meaning, perfect on all its sides.  There is healing in touch.  There is strength and warmth and life present in things hand-made.  This is an epic all its own. And it deserves being told.</p>
<p><img alt=""Kid at Sangha Farm"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.tocurefood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC00324.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Kid at Sangha Farm""/></p>
<p>So what of <strong><em>to cure:</em></strong>? What might be our mythos of creation? Like many good ideas, it was born one evening over a beer. Brad had dreams of Italy and returning to work on organic farms. Chris of northern France and research on the breweries to be found there. But we also yearned for America! Why seek elsewhere what is budding in our own backyard? So we decided that we’d set off on a journey. That we’d spend the summer travelling our country like the roots of grass, low to the ground, entrenched in the local soil. And like the grass grows, <strong><em>to cure:</em></strong> seemed to take on a life of its own.</p>
<p>While distinctly different individuals, we share one common passion: People and the things that nourish them. No doubt, we interpret nourish quite broadly; it is to not only to feed but also to fuel, to provide the life, the warmth, and the energy that keeps us going. We found in craft production the perfect combination of these: better food because it was made by living, breathing people who lived and breathed for it, and better people because they were engaged with their hands and with their minds in the making of the things they loved. As craft foods sustain those who make it and those who consume it, so too does it nourish us.</p>

<p>As students and educators of the American artisanal food renaissance, we are turning to you for help in spotlighting the behind-the-scenes producers and inspirational stories which continue to spur this movement ever forward.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>From May 2013 until September 1, 2013, we will be traveling the country, working with a myriad of brewers, cheesemakers, farmers, winemakers, salumists, and more - 15,000 miles and over 100 days of showcasing the passion and integrity inherent in small-scale craft production.</p>
<p>This campaign will allow us to complete principal data collection in the forms of photography, video, interviews, memoirs, and hands-on participation in various methods of artisanal food production. Your support will primarily help with production costs and the inevitable cost of extended transportation.</p>
<p>We invite you to be a founding member of our production team and to help this project ""gogo"" at a vital time in its genesis. You’ll be on the inside of The Anthology, a collection of compelling stories which will undoubtedly speak to our very roots as American consumers and entrepreneurs. And of course, we’ll keep you posted on our progress all along the way. We're so excited to launch this campaign, and to share our passion with others. No matter what your level of backing, we're hugely grateful, and so pleased to have you on board. Most of all, we look forward to introducing you to the inspiring cast of producer-characters who will take center stage in our project.</p>
<p><img alt=""Rough Map of The Anthology's Route"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.tocurefood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Trip-Map.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Rough Map of The Anthology's Route""/></p>
<p><strong>What Is indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p>Artisanal production has long been funded by patrons, individuals with various visions who support artistic and craft production.  Indiegogo combines the modern trend of eCommerce with classical patronage, allowing backers to contribute funding in exchange for a variety of rewards.  Rewards may be as simple as recipes or postcards, but frequently include finished products, producer credit, or, in the case of <strong><em>to</em> cure:</strong>, educational classes and artisanal swag.  Of course, our unending gratitude will accompany any contribution.</p>
<p>The campaign for <strong><em>""to cure: A Food</em> Anthology""</strong> ends on <strong>June 7, 2013</strong>, so it's important to respond soon.  And please, send a link to anyone else who might be interested.  Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>After I Pledge, When Will I Receive My Perk?</strong></p>
<p>Many of the Perk Levels <em><strong>to cure:</strong></em> offers include items or events which will be ready at various times.  The Indiegogo perk structure only allows us to submit one date for the estimated delivery of perks.</p>
<p>Posters, Recipes, and Swag (Artisanal Gifts from Producers) will be sent or delivered as they are received. This means we could be mailing you a t-shirt and glassware in early June, or some artisanal jams and honey in August.</p>
<p>If you donate to receive a Beer and Cheese Tasting class, we'll contact you with details regarding when we will be in your area.  From there, we'll work with you to pick the best date for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Finally, while the <em><strong>to cure: </strong></em>team wishes that the eJournals will be ready as soon as possible, in reality it takes time to do these projects the justice they deserve.  With our documentary endeavors wrapping up in late August, we expect that the first volume of The Anthology will be ready around November.  From there, we expect that volumes will be released every couple months until the set is complete.</p>

So we decided that we’d set off on a journey. That we’d spend the summer travelling our country like the roots of grass, low to the ground, entrenched in the local soil. And like the grass grows, to cure: seemed to take on a life of its own.
While distinctly different individuals, we share one common passion: People and the things that nourish them. No doubt, we interpret nourish quite broadly; it is to not only to feed but also to fuel, to provide the life, the warmth, and the energy that keeps us going. We found in craft production the perfect combination of these: better food because it was made by living, breathing people who lived and breathed for it, and better people because they were engaged with their hands and with their minds in the making of the things they loved. As craft foods sustain those who make it and those who consume it, so too does it nourish us.

As students and educators of the American artisanal food renaissance, we are turning to you for help in spotlighting the behind-the-scenes producers and inspirational stories which continue to spur this movement ever forward.
What We Need & What You Get
From May 2013 until September 1, 2013, we will be traveling the country, working with a myriad of brewers, cheesemakers, farmers, winemakers, salumists, and more - 15,000 miles and over 100 days of showcasing the passion and integrity inherent in small-scale craft production.
This campaign will allow us to complete principal data collection in the forms of photography, video, interviews, memoirs, and hands-on participation in various methods of artisanal food production. Your support will primarily help with production costs and the inevitable cost of extended transportation.
We invite you to be a founding member of our production team and to help this project ""gogo"" at a vital time in its genesis. You’ll be on the inside of The Anthology, a collection of compelling stories which will undoubtedly speak to our very roots as American consumers and entrepreneurs. And of course, we’ll keep you posted on our progress all along the way. We're so excited to launch this campaign, and to share our passion with others. No matter what your level of backing, we're hugely grateful, and so pleased to have you on board. Most of all, we look forward to introducing you to the inspiring cast of producer-characters who will take center stage in our project.

What Is indiegogo?
Artisanal production has long been funded by patrons, individuals with various visions who support artistic and craft production.  Indiegogo combines the modern trend of eCommerce with classical patronage, allowing backers to contribute funding in exchange for a variety of rewards.  Rewards may be as simple as recipes or postcards, but frequently include finished products, producer credit, or, in the case of to cure:, educational classes and artisanal swag.  Of course, our unending gratitude will accompany any contribution.
The campaign for ""to cure: A Food Anthology"" ends on June 7, 2013, so it's important to respond soon.  And please, send a link to anyone else who might be interested.  Thanks!
After I Pledge, When Will I Receive My Perk?
Many of the Perk Levels to cure: offers include items or events which will be ready at various times.  The Indiegogo perk structure only allows us to submit one date for the estimated delivery of perks.
Posters, Recipes, and Swag (Artisanal Gifts from Producers) will be sent or delivered as they are received. This means we could be mailing you a t-shirt and glassware in early June, or some artisanal jams and honey in August.
If you donate to receive a Beer and Cheese Tasting class, we'll contact you with details regarding when we will be in your area.  From there, we'll work with you to pick the best date for everyone involved.
Finally, while the to cure: team wishes that the eJournals will be ready as soon as possible, in reality it takes time to do these projects the justice they deserve.  With our documentary endeavors wrapping up in late August, we expect that the first volume of The Anthology will be ready around November.  From there, we expect that volumes will be released every couple months until the set is complete.
Can I Help to cure: In Some Other Way?
Of course!

<p>Hi! My name is Stacy C. Bauer. I am a wife, mother, teacher and author. I have always loved writing and have been sharing funny stories about my own children for years. 2 years ago, I took a leave from my career as a teacher and decided to write a book. I ran a successful kickstarter a year ago and was able to publish my first book Cami Kangaroo Has Too Many Sweets, a book based on my daughter Cami and her quest to sneak and eat every treat she could get her hands on. It also tells of the consequences she faced as a result of that. This was the first book in my series about my children, Cami and Wyatt: ""Cami Kangaroo and Wyatt Too"". </p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Beyond the Diploma</i> is a book that dives into the newfound autonomy that college students face after graduating. Through dozens of stories, I’ll share powerful messages and practical advice for leveraging the autonomy into happiness, success, and fulfillment, but on YOUR terms.</p>
<p>My name is Ashane Govind and I am the author of <i>Beyond the Diploma</i>. I wrote this book because I was shocked to learn what I truly cared about, after I graduated. For me, I learned that I missed a lot of things that I took for granted in college and that I cared about more than just my day job.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the degree of autonomy that you have in your life. Ultimately, I hope to instill some intellectual curiosity about your own post-grad journey to help you capitalize on the autonomy in your life.</p>
<p>If you recently graduated college and are faced with newfound control over your life, or if you’re just around the corner from that, I know you will benefit from hearing these stories.</p>
<p><i>Beyond the Diploma</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to recent grads and prospective grads who want to look at their future and their values in a new way.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>The book is based on the stories of others. I’ve interviewed 50+ college graduates and college students about their goals, values, and definitions of fulfillment. Each story you read will provide a different color of what the post-grad journey means. You'll learn about different kinds of autonomy in the post-graduation environment, and you'll hear dozens of stories from real-life individuals. Here's a taste:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Abrahan</strong>: A world-class mind from an undocumented family, spent his post-grad years proving to his family, his community, and most importantly, himself, that he has what it takes to compete with the best and the brightest.</li>
<li>
<strong>Melanie</strong>: A future doctor who spent her years of college trying to identify the best way she can save lives, and how she found her calling in optometry.</li>
<li>
<strong>Joonyoung</strong>: Through introspection and reflection in her college years - found that the camaraderie she felt with her swim teammates, college peers, and childhood friendships is what helps her unlock fulfillment and happiness at work.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keith</strong>: Through his college and post-grad adventure, Keith learned that no decision is truly final. Today, he's prioritizing his work week-by-week to keep doing things he's actually excited about.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. <strong>Money raised will go towards the following</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>editor </strong>I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2021.</li>
<li>The <strong>cover design </strong>of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The <strong>layout design</strong> for the interior of my book (physical copy, eBook formats).</li>
<li>The <strong>copy editing</strong> for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The <strong>launch &amp; promotion efforts</strong> for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>When I <strong>pre-sell 120 copies of my book</strong>, I will publish a paperback and eBook.</p>
<p>When I <strong>pre-sell 150 copies of my book</strong>, I will also publish a hardcover edition.</p>
<p>When I <strong>pre-sell 200 copies of my book</strong>, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am also offering some <strong>exclusive rewards</strong> for people who pre-order my book now:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive a <strong>personally signed copy</strong> of my book when I publish.</li>

<h3>About the Author</h3>

He graduated from New York University in 2019 and is completing his Masters in Business Analytics from University of Southern California. He loves to learn and always tries to find ways to think a little deeper.<br/><br/>Ashane loves to talk about interests, passions, and aspirations. He has only one goal for the impact of this book: to help readers think a little more carefully about their values, and layer them into their decision-making.<br/><br/>In his spare time, Ashane plays the saxophone, exercises, and hangs out with his quarantine puppy, Mac. Some say Ashane is a young, bright mind who loves to smile. Those who know Ashane closely, though, will tell you about his obsession with skincare, his weekly boba craving, and his funky sneaker collection.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Ashane on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashanegovind/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LinkedIn </a>or on Instagram <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ashanegovind/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@ashanegovind</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I’ve mitigated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I'll be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:<p>Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use <strong>#BeyondTheDiploma</strong> and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so that we can help amplify your efforts.</p>

Melanie: A future doctor who spent her years of college trying to identify the best way she can save lives, and how she found her calling in optometry.

Joonyoung: Through introspection and reflection in her college years - found that the camaraderie she felt with her swim teammates, college peers, and childhood friendships is what helps her unlock fulfillment and happiness at work.

Keith: Through his college and post-grad adventure, Keith learned that no decision is truly final. Today, he's prioritizing his work week-by-week to keep doing things he's actually excited about.

Alors qu’il y a plus d’un million de réfugiés syriens sur les territoires libanais, tous les réfugiés ne reçoivent pas l’aide fournie par UNHCR et les organisations non gouvernementales, surtout pas ceux qui vivent loin des grandes villes ou près de la frontière avec la Syrie. Nous avons décidé de lancer une campagne de levée de fonds afin d’acheter des vêtements chauds pour quelques milliers de réfugiés syriens qui vivent dans des tentes dans ce rude hiver. Les vêtements seront spécifiquement distribués aux réfugiés syriens du village d’Arsal, un village libanais situé au nord du Bekaa, dans la province de Baalback. On a choisi ce village car il est complètement isolé et peu d’aide y arrive. Les organisations non gouvernementales locales et internationales trouvent que cette région est loin des villes principales et est non sécuritaire en raison enraison des affrontements près de la frontière. Les routes amenant à Arsal ne sont pas développées et seules les voitures 4x4 puissent y arriver. Le village d’Arsal compte environ 30,000 habitants libanais et accueille présentement plus de 60,000 réfugiés syriens, la plupart d’entre eux vivant dans des tentes fournies par UNHCR. Ce camp réfugié est comme un cadeau empoisonné pour eux étant donné qu’on y manque la majorité des besoins élémentaires de survie.</p><h4>BREF APERÇU</h4><p>L'hiver de cette année est un des hivers les plus froids du siècle dernier. Les réfugiés syriens souffrent désespérément du froid. Beaucoup parmi eux arrivent au Liban sans argent ou pièce d’identité ce qui les fait souffrir de la faim et du froid. Ceux qui n’ont pas de pièces d’identité sur eux ne sont pas éligibles de l’aide fournie par l’UNHCR. Beaucoup parmi eux se sentent humiliés de demander de la nourriture ou des vêtements et préfèrent de souffrir seuls dans leurs tentes. Jusqu’à présent, à chaque jour plus de 30 familles rejoignent ce camp de réfugiés s’enfuyant de la Syrie et échappant à la mort sans savoir qu’un autre type de mort les attend à l’autre côté de la frontière. </p><p>Psychologiquement émus par la guerre, émotionnellement détruits par la perte de leurs maisons et des membres de leurs familles, torturés par le froid et les conditions de vie difficiles, beaucoup d’entre eux pensent retourner en Syrie et préfèrent mourir en dignité dans leur terre natale au lieu de vivre dans des conditions inhumaines. </p><p>On est un groupe de militants et militantes libanais; quelques-uns parmi nous travaillent dans le village d’Arsal et dans les autres camps réfugiés de la Bekaa et témoignent sur une base quotidienne les conditions des réfugiés syriens au Liban. Nous sommes concernés par la nonchalance nationale et internationale envers la crise syrienne. On pense que l’effort de militants à tous les niveaux allant de l’éducation jusqu’à la solidarité en termes de matériel est vraiment nécessaire. </p><h4>OBJECTIF</h4><p>Notre objectif est d’agir dans notre capacité en collectant des fonds afin de montrer notre solidarité, autant que possible, avec ceux qui ont été forcés de quitter leurs maisons en Syrie. En se basant sur des observations proches, nous avons remarqué que le besoin principal pour ces quelques mois est les vêtements chauds spécifiquement pour les enfants et les personnes âgées qui sont en train de mourir du froid. Notre objectif est de distribuer environ 500 articles d’habillement (chandails, chaussettes, gants, tuques, etc.) et des couvertures qui sont vendus sur le marché local libanais. Les prix moyens de ces articles, s’ils sont achetés dans les friperies ou dans les magasins locaux, varient entre 3$ et 10$. Notre objectif est de réchauffer autant qu’on peut les réfugiés syriens d’Arsal. On compte sur vous afin de donner à ce petit geste un sens significatif et chaud. Votre don, aussi petit qu’il peut être, est vraiment apprécié. Nous espérons que vous allez prendre en considération cette campagne et de faire une contribution qui va appuyer le peuple syrien pendant cet hiver. </p><p>Vous pouvez trouver ci-dessous quelques articles tirés des journaux locaux et<br/>internationaux sur la situation des camps de réfugiés syriens au nord du Bekaa<br/>au Liban qui peuvent vous aider à comprendre mieux la situation.

As there are over one million Syrian refugees on the Lebanese territories, help provided by UNHCR and Non Profit Organizations is not reaching everyone, especially those who live far from the big cities and by the Syrian borders. We decided to launch a campaign to collect some money in order to buy some warm clothes for the thousands of Syrian refugees that are living in tents in this harsh winter. The clothes will be specifically distributed to the Syrian refugees in the village of Arsal, a Lebanese village situated by the Syrian borders in the North of Bekaa, in the province of Baalback in Lebanon. We chose this village as it is isolated and little help is getting there. Local and international Non Profit Organizations find this region very far from the main cities and unsecure because of of the fighting near the borders.<span>  The roads leading to this village are not developed and only 4x4 cars can get there. The village of Arsal has 30,000 Lebanese inhabitants and is hosting over 60,000 Syrian refugees most of them living in tents provided by the UNHCR. This refugee camp is like a poisoned gift for them as it lacks most of the basic survival needs. </span></p><h4><span>BRIEF OVERVIEW</span></h4><p>The winter this year is one the coldest winters in the last century. Syrian refugees are suffering desperately from the cold. Many among them arrived to Lebanon without any money or any ID which makes them suffer from hunger and cold. Those who don’t have any ID on them are not eligible to the aid given by UNHCR. Many among them feel humiliated to ask for food and clothes and prefer to suffer alone in their tents. Until now, every day at least 30 more families join this camp fleeing away from Syria and escaping death without knowing that another kind of death is waiting for them at the other side of the borders.</p><p>Psychologically chocked by the war, emotionally destroyed by the loss of their houses or members of their family, tortured by the cold and hard living conditions, many of them are thinking of going back to Syria and preferring to die in dignity in their homeland instead of living under these unhuman conditions.</p><p>We are a group of young Lebanese activists in which some of us are working in Arsal village and the camps in the bekaa, who are witnessing the bad living conditions of Syrian refugees in Lebanon on a daily basis and are concerned by the local and international indolence towards the Syrian crisis. We feel that this effort of grassroots<br/>activists on all levels from education to actual material solidarity is necessary. </p><h4>GOAL</h4><p>Our aim is to act within our capacities by fundraising to show solidarity as much as we can with those who have been forced to flee from their homes in Syria. Based on some closed observations, we noticed that the main need during the couple of months is warm clothes especially for kids and elderly who are dying from cold. We are aiming on distributing around 500 warm clothing items (sweaters, socks, gloves, hats, etc.) and blankets that sold on the local Lebanese market. The average prices for these items if they are bought from local second stores or from local stores are between 3$<span>  to 10$. Our aim is to make as warm as we can the Syrian refugees in Arsal. We really count on you on making this small gesture a meaningful and warm one. Your donation as small as it can be would really be appreciated. We hope that you will check out our fundraising campaign and consider making a contribution to support the Syrian refugees this winter.</span></p><p>You can find below some articles from the local and international news about the situation of Syrian refugees in the region of Northern Bekaa in Lebanon that can help you understand better the situation.

She wants to go to college to study child psychology and help other children having difficulties.  Although my daughter is doing great now, when she first moved in, she caused some chaos which impacted my work.  My supervisor was aware of my unhappiness with my job and wanted me off the team because she felt my dissatisfaction was having a negative impact on other team members.  In May, she let me go.  I applied for and received unemployment, which allowed us to cover daily living expenses.  My daughter's father did not and still does not pay child support.Looking for work involves a fair amount of networking.  I realized that many of my friends were also unemployed or underemployed.  As a group, we are stressed and scared, neither of which is a good way to live.  I wanted to help myself, but I also want to help my friends do better.  I thought, if I can figure out how to support myself, I can show other people how to do that, or maybe I can even create jobs within my community.  In December, my unemployment award ran out.  Dates are fairly important here.  My last date that was payable was 12/14.  My last day to request payment was 12/22.  I called the unemployment office to find out what they needed for the extension, and I was informed that the last day for extensions was 12/28.  When I was unemployed in the past, as long as I qualified for the extension before the end date, I got paid.  I explained this to the unemployment lady.  She informed me that per the federal government, even if I qualified for the extension, she was unable to disperse any funds after 12/28.  I have applied for welfare.  For the first time in 3 months, I have heard from a company that is interested in interviewing me.  I have completed the training to be an ESL teacher.  And, I don't want to rely on one source of income any longer.  Which brings me to my project, Kiss 5 Tigers.What is Kiss 5 Tigers?One morning I woke up with the phrase ""kiss 5 tigers"" blazing in my brain.  I had no idea what that actually meant at the time, so I tried to ignore it but it wouldn't go away.  After much searching of my personal iconography, I realized that the tigers represent things that are attractive but also big, scary and potentially dangerous.  The number 5 indicated different areas of life.  Kissing these tigers, then, means to draw close and be fairly intimate with big scary issues in several areas of my life.Kiss5Tigers on Wordpress.com is the blog I began in response to this internal imperative.My original plan was to share my successes and inspirations, and that's still on the table!  I am not unusual, so I figured if I could build a better life and achieve a certain amount of success, then my path might be helpful to other people.However, as I have become downwardly mobile, a second function has emerged.  I want a platform to share my truth and my story.  Again, I am not unusual: if I am having these struggles, so are other people.  If I struggle with transportation or paying rent or feeding my child, so do other people.  It's a fundamental principle of women's experience, that speaking our truths publicly is revolutionary.  I'm not seeking a revolution in society, only in my life!  I am ready for the wheel to turn and to begin the upward climb, and I believe it's important to share that story with people.  Not because my story is outstanding or because I am noteworthy, but because it is common and I am typical, and therefore my story - like other average people's stories - is invisible.  Henry David Thoreau has famously said, ""'Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them.""  I want to do better than that, and I want you to do better too!  Kiss5Tigers the blog is my way of singing my song.When I started this project, I was employed and the fee to register my domain name seemed negligible.  Today, with so little money left in the bank, unemployment run out, and a welfare application in process, I simply cannot justify spending even this small amount on something that is not a necessity.Therefore I stand before you, hat in hand, asking for assistance keeping this token of my dream alive.  Nitty GrittyIn truth, it would cost me under $20.00 to keep this domain name.  Indiegogo requires that I request $500.00 and as an unemployed single mom, I assure you, extra money would not be wasted!  Keeping my cell phone turned on and my internet functional are also necessary for job hunting.  I don't have a car, but bus fare is $5.00 any time I need to go to the doctor, the unemployment office, a food pantry or an interview.Just a few donations of a couple of dollars would resolve my domain registration cost.  And of course, if you choose not to assist, please spread the word!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

James is confident, intelligent, smug, handsome...and an addict, regularly succumbing to alcohol, drugs and sex. He also happens to be a vampire, which in a world without humans, is the norm. His trusted friend and driver Ian Worth is a shadow, a genetically inferior vampire, who like others of his kind, are generally looked down upon by the pure vampires and treated like second class citizens.

It is 97 years after a devastating world war and plague have destroyed large sections of the planet, leveling cities, polluting the environment and decimating the population. Predicting this event, and partially causing it, a group of the very oldest and most powerful vampires, the Eternals, prepared elaborate bunkers to save some of the population. Now new cities are being built, order has been restored and life is starting to move on. The Eternals have gone into hiding, protected by the Guardians and the Sothurian Council. Technology, which was partially blamed for the collapse of civilization, is slowly being rebuilt, but it is costly and unreliable. Primitive computers, cell phones and cars are available only to the government and the elite. Electricity is limited, candles and gas lamps light the city, while horses and carriages fill the streets. Prostitution, gambling and some drugs are legal, used to keep the general populace complacent. ""Human Fiction"" is the latest fad in books and plays. The most popular beverage is wine mixed with animal blood.</p><p>     Port Stoker is populated by a wide array of characters, all with their own secrets and hidden agendas, and Detective Pub Riley has more than most. Many of these he even keeps from his best friend and driver, Ian Worth. Ian is a shadow, a second class citizen of the vampire world. His friendship with Pub has taken him into many parts of vampire society that he never would have experienced otherwise. Into their lives comes Tinka, a shadow with a past that she either cannot or will not remember. Her fate is quickly intertwined with those of Pub and Ian as they are thrust into the middle of a mystery bigger than any they have ever known. The town is led by Mayor Jordy Darkwood, a vampire struggling with his conscience as he fights to hold things together as the politics of the old world and the new come crashing together, while his wife Mercy is hiding the fact that she is one of Pub's many mistresses. Lorlet, a local herbalist and psychic, is a confidant of Pub's, and the only female he has not been able to seduce. The underworld of Port Stoker is ruled by The Edge and his ruthless enforcer, Mr. Bates, both of whom know more of the secrets of Freeland than most. Then there are Ivy, Rose and Thorne LePlante, the triplet owners of Satiate, the towns largest brothel and gambling hall, which is a frequent haunt of Pub's. Other important characters include Favour Boulet, art gallery owner and one of Pub's frequent conquests, Wheezy Becket, Pub's landlady and owner of Becket's Books, Professor Myers Eller, expert in human mythology, and Seatta Seaut, an author whose human fiction books, The Sun Dancers,  have become all the rage. And then there is Savean, a female vampire of great mystery, power and beauty, recently returned to town from parts unknown with an agenda that will forever change Port Stoker, Freeland and all who live there.</p><p>   <em><strong>  Blood and Wine </strong></em>will be the first of six books in a series by the same name. Over the course of the series, many secrets will be revealed, relationships formed and tested, conspiracies will run wild and a shocking revelation will change everything and everyone.</p><h2> What Do I Want To Achieve?</h2><p>      First and foremost, I want to entertain the reader with a world unlike any they have ever seen, with characters both unique and exciting, but at the same time believable and relatable. I want to take the vampire legend and honor its history and traditions while also infusing it with new ideas of what a vampire is. In most vampire stories, humans are in integral part to the story. We seldom see how vampires act among themselves when they are not trying to seduce or devour people. In <em><strong> Blood and Wine,</strong></em> I have crafted  a unique and well thought out world where humans do not exist. I want to immerse readers into a very detailed landscape, reimagined through the eyes of a vampire. What would a world look like where its inhabitants can never venture into the sun? I spent years creating this world, focusing on the smallest of details, and believe that I have come up with a place never before seen in literature. I have greatly enjoyed creating this place and these one of a kind characters. I hope you enjoy reading about them and come to love(and hate) them as much as I do.</p><h2> Who Am I?</h2><p>     Good question. The answer has many parts, some that are still being added as I continue to change and learn new things about myself. The important part, at least in this instance, is that I am a story teller, a crafter of lore, who has finally decided to put it all down into a series of novels and try my hand as a writer. I have written many short stories and some a little too long to be called short stories, but this only my second attempt at a novel. The first ended when I realized I didn't really care about the characters or believe in the story. That's what makes this time so different. With Blood and Wine, I have spent years thinking about this story, dissecting every part of it, reworking the ideas, throwing out the ones that didn't work and expanding the ones that did. I have created a world full of characters, some who made the cut and some who didn't and some who turned out to be totally different than who I originally thought they were. I have breathed life into this place and to me it has become real, not in the I'm crazy way, but in the way that I finally believe in what I'm writing, I care about the characters and what happens to them, even the not so nice ones and there are a lot of those.</p><p>     My simple bio is that I grew up in the '70s in a small town in North Carolina. I honed my imagination in a time before technology started killing it. I was always a voracious reader, spending many hours in our towns library, always checking out the maximum amount of books. I read everything I could get my hands on, and at some point decided, I want to do that. Of course, as it often does, life got in the way and being a writer was put on the back burner. Now after a lifetime of many different careers, including over 10 years in the book selling business, and countless creative writing classes, it is time to pursue the dream, hopefully with your help.</p><p>     I have been living in Las Vegas for the past 10 years and although I don't think I have ever actually met one, if vampires do exist, this is where they would live. This town has reawakened my imagination. I have met many unique individuals, some of whom have at least partially morphed into characters in my book. I have experienced what it's like to live in a place where you can actually do everything in the dark and sleep away the daylight hours. I use all of this to up the realism in the book.</p><h2>What's The Money For and What Do You Get?</h2><p>     The money raised will be used for many different things.</p><p>   + to finance the completion of book one.</p><p>   + to self publish book one in digital and hardcover formats</p><p>   + to commission original artwork for the series</p><p>   + to market the series to find a major publisher to put the series in wide release</p><p>   + promotion of the series</p><p>The more money that is raised, will result in higher quality books published in greater quantity. Money left over will go towards book 2 in the series.</p><p>     For helping to fund this project, backers will receive many great rewards depending on the amount pledged. Some rewards include digital and hardcover copies, t-shirts, a personal thank you in the acknowledgements section of the book, a chance to name a character in the book, a chance to have me personally come to your house to read the book and much more. Check out the rewards section for more details. Without your support, it may take years to get this project completed if at all. With your contributions, I plan to be finished and meet all reward responsibilities by the end of May next year, if not sooner.</p><h2>   Risks And Challenges</h2><p>     There are always risks and unexpected challenges with any project. However, I promise to do my best to meet all deadlines and to produce an enjoyable quality book in the end. I have a strong support system of family and friends to help when and where needed, plus access to contacts from my many years in the book selling business. If any unforeseen obstacles arise or plans change, I will inform all backers immediately. I will also be posting constant updates on the status of the project. Also please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p> I know that not everyone can contribute financially. I appreciate any amount that you can give. It all adds up.  You can also help by getting the word out about my project to as many people as possible by posting it on your Facebook page or Twitter or posting it on group pages. I can also always use more contacts in the publishing world.</p><h2>And Lastly</h2><p>     I would like to thank everyone who has taken the time to read my proposal. I hope you will be able to help out. I believe that Blood and Wine is something special and I hope that you will too once you read it.

<h2>Die Story</h2>
<p>Gestern, heute, morgen - wie geht man mit einem in sich kollabierenden Universum um und wie steht dieses im Zusammenhang mit dem Individuum? Der Kampf eines jungen Mannes mit der eigenen Selbstwahrnehmung in der Berliner Startup-Welt; ein Sturm, der die Welt verändern soll; ein Dorf im Osten Deutschlands, welches sich mit den Schattenseiten des Kapitalismus auseinandersetzen muss; der Selbstmord eines vielversprechenden Komponisten; oder die Geschichte von Rahel, einer jungen Frau, die vor dem Nichts steht - dies sind die Schicksale im Zentrum des ersten Bands der Genre-Mix-Reihe <i>Metronomarchie</i>.</p>
<h3>2012/Alexander</h3>
<p>Ein Sturm bewegt sich von Asien her auf Europa zu und droht den Kontinent zu zerstören. So zumindest beschreibt es ein Manuskript, welches dem Startup-Unternehmer Alexander zugespielt wird und indem er eine tragende Figur ist. Als zusätzlich noch Fotos auf seinem Instagram-Account auftauchen, auf denen er an Orten zu sehen ist, an denen er noch niemals war, gemeinsam mit Menschen, die er nicht kennt, fängt er an Nachforschungen zu erstellen und gerät tiefer und tiefer in ein Netz aus Verschwörungen.</p>
<h3>2015/Sebastian</h3>
<p>Um die Schließung des Glaswerks in dem Thüringischen Dorf Obergrundbach zu verhindern, entschließt sich eine Gruppe junger Arbeiter um den charismatischen Streikführer Benjamin dazu, das Werk zu besetzen. Zur gleichen Zeit kommt der Cousin des Streikführers, Sebastian, ins Dorf und wird kurzerhand in die Verhandlungen mit dem US-Amerikanischen Eigentümer eingespannt.</p>
<h3>2018/Ezra</h3>
<p>Krystalis, ein modernes Schloss und Campus für Hochbegabte, errichtet von Milliardärs-Zwillingen außerhalb von Berlin, in dem junge Menschen ungestört an der Zukunft arbeiten können; ein Utopia, das überschattet wird von einem Selbstmord. Das siebenundzwanzigjährige Komponistenwunderkind Ezra nimmt sich das Leben und hinterlässt einen letzten Wunsch: Sein Meisterwerk, die Krystalis-Symphonie, soll von einem Outsider abgeschlossen werden - seinem ehemals besten Freund.

<h2>Die Kampagne</h2>
<p><i>Metronomarchie - Buch Eins: Boys</i> ist der erste Teil einer neuen Science-Fiction-/Fantasy-/Gegenwartsroman-Reihe. Da der erste Band mit ca. <strong>130 000 Wörtern</strong> bereits ziemlich umfangreich ausgefallen ist, bin ich mir sicher, dass einige Passagen über eine reguläre Verlagsveröffentlichung dem Rotstift der Lektoren zum Opfer fallen würden. Da mir aber jedes Wort am Herzen liegt, habe ich mich dazu entschloßen, eine erste ungekürzte Auflage über eine Crowdfunding-Kampagne zu finanzieren.</p>
<p>Die Kampagne hat nur ein geringes Funding-Ziel, da ich keine fixe Auflage drucken lasse, sondern mich nach euch Unterstützern richte, d.h.: Wenn 13 Unterstützer eine gedruckte Version wollen, dann bestelle ich 13 Stück.</p>
<p>Long story short: Der Roman ist abgeschlossen und wer eine erste, ungekürzte Version des Romans lesen möchte, sollte sie hier bestellen.</p>
<h3>Die verschiedenen Versionen</h3>
<p>Das eBook bekommt ihr bereits zum kleinen Preis. Die gedruckte Version ist etwas teurer, dafür aber sehr schön geworden - ihr werdet also die Mehrinvestition nicht bereuen. Außerdem bekommt jeder, der die gedruckte Variante bestellt, das eBook kostenlos dazu (ist ja klar).</p>

</div></div>","Die Story
Gestern, heute, morgen - wie geht man mit einem in sich kollabierenden Universum um und wie steht dieses im Zusammenhang mit dem Individuum? Der Kampf eines jungen Mannes mit der eigenen Selbstwahrnehmung in der Berliner Startup-Welt; ein Sturm, der die Welt verändern soll; ein Dorf im Osten Deutschlands, welches sich mit den Schattenseiten des Kapitalismus auseinandersetzen muss; der Selbstmord eines vielversprechenden Komponisten; oder die Geschichte von Rahel, einer jungen Frau, die vor dem Nichts steht - dies sind die Schicksale im Zentrum des ersten Bands der Genre-Mix-Reihe Metronomarchie.
2012/Alexander
Ein Sturm bewegt sich von Asien her auf Europa zu und droht den Kontinent zu zerstören. So zumindest beschreibt es ein Manuskript, welches dem Startup-Unternehmer Alexander zugespielt wird und indem er eine tragende Figur ist. Als zusätzlich noch Fotos auf seinem Instagram-Account auftauchen, auf denen er an Orten zu sehen ist, an denen er noch niemals war, gemeinsam mit Menschen, die er nicht kennt, fängt er an Nachforschungen zu erstellen und gerät tiefer und tiefer in ein Netz aus Verschwörungen.
2015/Sebastian
Um die Schließung des Glaswerks in dem Thüringischen Dorf Obergrundbach zu verhindern, entschließt sich eine Gruppe junger Arbeiter um den charismatischen Streikführer Benjamin dazu, das Werk zu besetzen. Zur gleichen Zeit kommt der Cousin des Streikführers, Sebastian, ins Dorf und wird kurzerhand in die Verhandlungen mit dem US-Amerikanischen Eigentümer eingespannt.
2018/Ezra
Krystalis, ein modernes Schloss und Campus für Hochbegabte, errichtet von Milliardärs-Zwillingen außerhalb von Berlin, in dem junge Menschen ungestört an der Zukunft arbeiten können; ein Utopia, das überschattet wird von einem Selbstmord. Das siebenundzwanzigjährige Komponistenwunderkind Ezra nimmt sich das Leben und hinterlässt einen letzten Wunsch: Sein Meisterwerk, die Krystalis-Symphonie, soll von einem Outsider abgeschlossen werden - seinem ehemals besten Freund. Als dieser nach Krystalis kommt und mit der Arbeit beginnt, ahnt er noch nicht, dass er sich bald auf die wahre Natur des Schlosses stoßen wird und auf dessen dunkle Geheimnisse.
Wie hängen diese Ereignisse zusammen? Welche Rolle spielt die mysteriöse Tomorrow Alliance? Was ist real und was sind Verschiebungen in Zeit und Raum? Metronomarchie - Buch Eins: Boys ist der Auftakt zu einer Buchreihe, die alle Ebenen der Existenz durchdringt und die Schönheit und Tragik der kollektiven menschlichen Erfahrung offenlegt.

<h3>World, meet Annabelle McLeod<br/>
</h3> We are often cautioned against inappropriate behavior throughout our lives. Well-wishing parents and friends scold us for being different, advise us to get back with the program, behave. But what if the opposite of the norm is where the truth lives? This is the driving question behind my creation of Inappropriate and Annabelle McLeod. As the star of this story, Annabelle is a woman determined to buck the status quo and carve out a meaningful life beyond the bounds of acceptable behavior.   <br/><br/>I began work on this manuscript in 2010, with the guidance and support of my deeply talented writing group. Along the way, I have been astonished at the resiliency, grit and gusto of Annabelle. This story has cinematic elements and the settings are often grungy, bleak, and textured. The characters are flawed and jagged and profoundly human. Annabelle's family is steeped in age old regrets and resentments and she struggles to find the support she needs. She searches for meaning in the seediest places, including dodgy donut shops and grimy basements. Addictions are explored in graphic detail during her forced residence in a rehab clinic. A stroke of luck takes her to Manhattan to work as a commercial photographer and she is surrounded by a new crop of unforgettable friends and peers who have a profoundly positive impact on her. There is a dark experience at the Chelsea Hotel that threatens to shatter her forever until she returns home to her family in London, finding solace, peace, and redemption. <br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>My goal with this story is to illuminate the murky parts of life and ultimately show beauty in the ignored nooks and crannies of working class society. It is my deepest hope that others will find universal elements in the story and within Annabelle and emerge from this with new perspective and enthusiasm for life.<br/><br/>Although I have just reached the 60% mark in my manuscript, the word is already getting out and I have been gifted with tremendous support and feedback from the community. I have been invited to share Annabelle with future readers on the radio and as part of literary events around Calgary, including Flywheel at Shelf Life Books.

<div style=""border-color: initial !important;"">
<h3><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: 19px;"">About Us</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Hi!  My Name Is Jay Davis.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">My colleagues and I are all teachers, trainers or consultants in one form or another.  In fact, one of my colleagues, Mr. Dan Valdez, is the principle author of the #1 entrepreneurial curriculum in the United States (Bauer College of Business).  Another, Mr. Randall Montalbano is (in my opinion) one of the top rated Marketing Consultants on the planet (validated by his consistent Top 5 ranking on marketingprofs.com).  I am blessed to be surrounded with many other teachers and trainers of the highest caliber.  Far too many to name here.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">I have personally developed a system of learning that I believe can perpetuate a person with ""average"" intellect to certified ""genius"", simply by engaging a certain part of the brain through reading.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">This requires very painstaking formatting and layout, as well as significant graphic design work to produce each full color publication, but I think that this can revolutionize the way that reference texts and educational books are written.  Perhaps even change our entire educational system.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The Impact</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">""50 Pages On..."" is the merging of two problems into a single solution. <br/></span></p>
<span style=""font-size: small;"">The first problem is the fact that it is too difficult to find valid, expert level references to learn from and/or to cite for your research.  The sources that are out there are either hundreds of pages long, or if they are short, they are too generalized to gain any level of true expert comprehension, and definitely can't be used as valid reference citations for your work.  </span>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">The second is the problem of ""frontal lobe numbing"", which inhibits our cognitive abilities and thereby limits our intellectual prowess.  The system and format in which this series will be delivered re-sensitizes our frontal lobe and reinforces a barrier against future ""numbing"".  The result being that we learn much faster, comprehend complex concepts to a higher degree and retain information longer.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Our system of learning can literally revolutionize the way that reference and educational texts are written.  This could mean a total paradigm shift in academia as a whole.  Many so-called experts will be nay-sayers on our theory, so the only way to prove it is to DO IT!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;""><strong>NOTE:</strong> </span></p>
<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Reading is the fundamental tool used in formalized learning in most of the civilized world.  This is an indirect form of learning as it requires a person to recognize, analyze and interpret incoming data, then produce a corresponding (and hopefully accurate) output based on no sensory perception of the ""object of focus"".  The experience is totally virtual.  This system tends to be </span><em style=""font-weight: normal;"">somewhat </em><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">effective; however the natural learning mechanism is sensory based and no ""focus relevant"" senses are engaged by reading...UNLESS you access the part of the brain that associates memories and experiences that were originally gained through sensory perception!  Story tellers do this very well, and story telling is an excellent method for teaching.  The problem is that most academia based knowledge cannot be efficiently told in a story (unless you know the Ancient Egyptian Secrets).</span></span>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">""50 Pages On..."" provides a new type of learning mechanism that engages the reader in a manner that activates that part of the brain that connects data, images, memories AND sensory perception in order to solve complex problems (cognitive reasoning).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br/></span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: medium;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></h2>
<span style=""font-size: small;"">This project will allow us to produce the first 3 titles of this comprehensive series that will eventually cover every subject under and beyond the Sun. Three experts (one of them being myself) have agreed to take their time over the next 60 days (after funding), and write a book in the ""50 Pages On..."" format.  These first three titles are targeted for those who are specifically looking for information to improve themselves as entrepreneurs; however, it is also flooded with information beneficial to any casual reader.  Each one is designed to be read in one sitting and easily referenced for specific information.</span>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">We are asking to raise $5000 to facilitate the extensive graphic design that is customized for each major topic/theme covered inside each title, and the editing and proofing of our proprietary formatting strategy.  Three professionals will dedicate the next 60 days of their lives (after funding) to produce these titles in the prescribed format.  This will take several draft stages to make sure that the content is delivered in 50 pages, and that it meets the necessary requirements to fulfill the educational goals outlined above.  3 related titles must be created at the same time in order to produce the strong synapses necessary to induce the deeper and faster comprehension and longer retention that we assert will occur.  However, we MUST pay our graphic designers, proof readers and editors for their time and effort in this rigorous process.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Contributing to this project will allow us to keep the cost of the retail product below $10 (for FULL COLOR copies).  The authors will pay out of pocket costs for the difference between what we raise from this project and our goal (should we come up short).  However, we sincerely hope that we gain enough supporters who see the value of our efforts to fund this initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Contributors of $5 or more will have the opportunity to receive copies of the finished products (SEE PERKS) in various forms.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br/></span></p>

</div></div>","About Us
Hi!  My Name Is Jay Davis.  
My colleagues and I are all teachers, trainers or consultants in one form or another.  In fact, one of my colleagues, Mr. Dan Valdez, is the principle author of the #1 entrepreneurial curriculum in the United States (Bauer College of Business).  Another, Mr. Randall Montalbano is (in my opinion) one of the top rated Marketing Consultants on the planet (validated by his consistent Top 5 ranking on marketingprofs.com).  I am blessed to be surrounded with many other teachers and trainers of the highest caliber.  Far too many to name here.
I have personally developed a system of learning that I believe can perpetuate a person with ""average"" intellect to certified ""genius"", simply by engaging a certain part of the brain through reading.
This requires very painstaking formatting and layout, as well as significant graphic design work to produce each full color publication, but I think that this can revolutionize the way that reference texts and educational books are written.  Perhaps even change our entire educational system.
 
The Impact
""50 Pages On..."" is the merging of two problems into a single solution. 
The first problem is the fact that it is too difficult to find valid, expert level references to learn from and/or to cite for your research.  The sources that are out there are either hundreds of pages long, or if they are short, they are too generalized to gain any level of true expert comprehension, and definitely can't be used as valid reference citations for your work.  
The second is the problem of ""frontal lobe numbing"", which inhibits our cognitive abilities and thereby limits our intellectual prowess.  The system and format in which this series will be delivered re-sensitizes our frontal lobe and reinforces a barrier against future ""numbing"".  The result being that we learn much faster, comprehend complex concepts to a higher degree and retain information longer.
Our system of learning can literally revolutionize the way that reference and educational texts are written.  This could mean a total paradigm shift in academia as a whole.  Many so-called experts will be nay-sayers on our theory, so the only way to prove it is to DO IT!
NOTE: 
Reading is the fundamental tool used in formalized learning in most of the civilized world.  This is an indirect form of learning as it requires a person to recognize, analyze and interpret incoming data, then produce a corresponding (and hopefully accurate) output based on no sensory perception of the ""object of focus"".  The experience is totally virtual.  This system tends to be somewhat effective; however the natural learning mechanism is sensory based and no ""focus relevant"" senses are engaged by reading...UNLESS you access the part of the brain that associates memories and experiences that were originally gained through sensory perception!  Story tellers do this very well, and story telling is an excellent method for teaching.  The problem is that most academia based knowledge cannot be efficiently told in a story (unless you know the Ancient Egyptian Secrets).
""50 Pages On..."" provides a new type of learning mechanism that engages the reader in a manner that activates that part of the brain that connects data, images, memories AND sensory perception in order to solve complex problems (cognitive reasoning).

What We Need & What You Get
This project will allow us to produce the first 3 titles of this comprehensive series that will eventually cover every subject under and beyond the Sun. Three experts (one of them being myself) have agreed to take their time over the next 60 days (after funding), and write a book in the ""50 Pages On..."" format.  These first three titles are targeted for those who are specifically looking for information to improve themselves as entrepreneurs; however, it is also flooded with information beneficial to any casual reader.  Each one is designed to be read in one sitting and easily referenced for specific information.
We are asking to raise $5000 to facilitate the extensive graphic design that is customized for each major topic/theme covered inside each title, and the editing and proofing of our proprietary formatting strategy.  Three professionals will dedicate the next 60 days of their lives (after funding) to produce these titles in the prescribed format.  This will take several draft stages to make sure that the content is delivered in 50 pages, and that it meets the necessary requirements to fulfill the educational goals outlined above.  3 related titles must be created at the same time in order to produce the strong synapses necessary to induce the deeper and faster comprehension and longer retention that we assert will occur.  However, we MUST pay our graphic designers, proof readers and editors for their time and effort in this rigorous process.
Contributing to this project will allow us to keep the cost of the retail product below $10 (for FULL COLOR copies).  The authors will pay out of pocket costs for the difference between what we raise from this project and our goal (should we come up short).  However, we sincerely hope that we gain enough supporters who see the value of our efforts to fund this initiative.
Contributors of $5 or more will have the opportunity to receive copies of the finished products (SEE PERKS) in various forms.



Other Ways You Can Help

Please Spread The Word!  Even $1 helps this cause and allows us to begin to change the educational system from the inside out.  There are various sharing tools provided by the IndieGoGo platform.  Please use these to expose this and other great IndieGoGo projects to your social network.

<div> </div>
<div>Greetings, my name is Amanda Reaves, and I have been working on the Christian Fantasy world of Astria Legends for over ten years. I desire to empower our future generations with the knowledge that they can make a difference both in their own lives and in the lives of others. I want to teach them that every decision that they make has the power to affect those they will never come in contact with and can last lifetimes. The Dawn of Unity Series is a fantasy, something that young adults as well as adults can get into, but it is also a tool. A tool that shows young adults that no matter how old they are, what they have done, what they have been through, their background, race, how they were brought up or what others have said about them, that it is never too late to make a change.<br/><br/>

<h3>Synopsis of the Series:</h3>
<p>Welcome to the Astria Galaxy, a world filled with myths, legends and creatures of all different backgrounds and species. High above them, between the galaxy and the heavens, lies Astria; the world of living breathing color. Angels to some, protectors to others, the Astrians live as one with the universe, becoming anything it needs. Created by the Exalted One, they are the only protection between the galaxy and Sin. Some will overcome, while some give in. Their choices effect the overall UNITY; a delicate creature whose influence could destroy the galaxy. It is then that the biggest lessons are learned...</p>

<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>The first novel in the Dawn of Unity series: Genesis has already been published and over 100 copies have been sold. Exodus, which is the second book in the series (despite being published first) didn't have a great turnout. Now I am taking it and giving it an entire makeover.</p>
<p>The Exodus II project will not only produce a second edition to Exodus, but also have a full animated show as part of the novel's release party. The movie above is just a sample of the animation that I am working on.</p>

The third book will focus on the prime number mysteries and codebreaking.In addition to this series, we want to create animated educational shorts featuring Off Kilta Matilda™ and her friends and work towards a computer game that will educate kids (and parents) on math. (one of our coloring sheets) When you back this campaign you are helping create a future where girls embrace math. Where numbers are fun and not at all scary.Please back the project and help launch Off Kilta Matilda™ and the Prime Number Club™.What are people saying? Well, Check this out!  Check out the press. Why do we need funding? Off Kilta Matilda™ has been a bootstrapped project from the start. I've put thousands of dollars and hours into bringing this to life. I’ve paid the designer, the videographer and artists and filed all of the copyrights and trademarks. I’ve done the market research, a landscape analysis and met with teachers, mathematicians, business owners and publishers. We have secured printing and all of our perks used during this campaign are sourced in the USA. All of our work has  been sourced locally in Kansas City. Our designer, videographer, editor, and office are all here in KC. We seek funding because we want to grow quickly! We have goals, and then we have stretch goals.When we raise approximately $6,000, we can print 3000 Off Kilta Matilda™ books and design book #2.If we reach $10,000, we can design complete one of our shorts.  If we raise more, we go further. We have business plans from $5000 to $525,000. If you are interested in learning about the project, the plan or how to partner drop me a line.  We have the capacity and the ability to scale very quickly. Why should you believe me?I’ve been in marketing and communications for over 20 years. I’ve created and managed successful campaigns, launched three startups (all still in business), won quite a few awards, and have a great track record at finding product market fit. I’m launching this crowdfunding campaign to help raise capital and raise awareness about kids and STEM. I’m creating the campaign because the world needs it. Math is beautiful, fun and should not be presented as scary or hard.Please share this campaign with your family and friends and help bring Off Kilta™ Matilda and the Prime Number Club™ to life today! Thanks a bunch! -Sarah and the entire team.  This has been a family affair! The photo below is when the kids came with me to a pitch night for new business. We found out that evening hopped in the car and went.(this is a photo of our first prototype and a draft of the book)",10.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Hi, we're The Wild Word...</h3>
<p>An <strong>online magazine for passionate people</strong>, run by a rag-tag bunch of visionary, unashamedly left-wing enthusiasts for the written word.</p>
<p>For two years, The Wild Word (or TWW as our affectionate insiders call it) has delivered a great monthly online magazine. In that time, we've had dozens of our articles picked up by the <strong>Huffington Post </strong>and our parenting columnist was recently featured on <strong>US morning TV</strong>. We've published fiction writers who've gone on to publish novels and anthologies, and one of our artists-in-residence <strong>won a prize</strong> for a piece he created especially for his TWW residency.</p>
<p>In short, it's <strong>great content</strong>.</p>
<p>And it's all produced and made available for <strong>free</strong>, with <strong>no advertising</strong>. We're a true independent magazine, powered by <strong>volunteer energy</strong>.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of time and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe our voices matter – and that by speaking up, we represent the people who share our perspective, and those whose voices can't be heard.The start of the dream...</p>
<p>TWW was started by <strong>Kusi Okamura</strong>. Originally from Ireland (you can tell by her name), where she worked in journalism, these days Kusi is a Berlin-based mother and entrepreneur. After her children were born, Kusi started dreaming about a platform for arts and issues, a place where people's creativity would be on show and their voices could be heard. So she started it from her back room. Along the way she figured out how to build the website, and sought out great writers, artists and musicians and convinced them to come on board.</p>
<p><strong>Erin O'Loughlin</strong> (who isn't Irish, despite the name) submitted some fiction to one of the first issues, and over coffee with Kusi she found herself irresistibly drawn to Kusi's enthusiasm and vision. She became Associate Editor, then Fiction Editor, and has never looked back.</p>
<div><p>We cover the issues we care deeply about, with <strong>monthly columns on the environment, feminism, politics, social justice, parenting, and mental health - with a generous side helping of arts, poetry and fiction.</strong></p></div>
<p>Now, we're asking our readers to give a little something back, so that we can continue to produce great content, and to <strong>launch our next passion project</strong> - a small publishing press, to help writers we love become published authors.</p>
<h3>Here's what they are saying about us</h3>
<p><i>Working with The Wild Word has been a tremendous pleasure. The journal is <strong>beautiful,</strong> <strong>relevant </strong>and <strong>ambitious</strong>; Kusi is a subtle editor and a perceptive, enthusiastic <strong>visionary</strong>. I so look forward to what she does next.</i></p>
<p><strong>Donna Steiner</strong><br/>Writer and artist</p>
<p><i>Before encountering the opportunity on The Wild Word's website, I'd never heard of an online Artist in Residency (o-AiR).  What <strong>a bright beam-of-an-opportunity </strong>it provided me -- into corners of poetry I'd not yet explored.  For example, while poetry shadows have been on my mind, the o-AiR was where and when I first discussed them.  While many artists have likely enjoyed a traditional place-based residency, Kusi Okamura and her team have opened <strong>a whole new opportunity in e-space</strong> to dance, prance and cavort.  Yes! </i></p>
<p><strong>Hiram Larew</strong><br/>Poet</p>
<h3><strong>It's all about the give and take...</strong></h3>
<p>Ever heard someone say ""I'd do it even if I didn't get paid?"" Well that's how we feel about the magazine. Except we actually don't get paid.</p>
<p>Our aim (okay, dream) is to make the magazine a <strong>self-supporting platform</strong>, one where we can pay our contributors. For now, <strong>we'll keep putting out the good stuff</strong>, month after month.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we've got bills to pay.</p>
<p>- Like the <strong>cover artist</strong> for the upcoming novel we're publishing, a genre-bending cyberpunk, facebook-punk (we're coining the term), noir, LGBTQ novel that the world needs to read.</p>
<p>- And <strong>print copies of our poetry and fiction anthologies</strong> from the first year, for all the poets and writers who have entrusted their work to us (for free, y'all. These amazing artists let us have their work, even though we couldn't pay them. We really owe them a book).  </p>
<p>- And the <strong>production of the upcoming ebook</strong> from TWW columnist Jami Ingledue whose parenting column has garnered many fans for her from-the-heart style.</p>
<p>- And all the <strong>coffee and co-working cafes</strong> that go into getting the magazine out each month.</p>
<p>It's a fairly modest amount. We're not asking for the moon (but if anyone has one to donate, we wouldn't say no).</p>
<p>In return, we're offering rewards like:</p>
<p>- <strong>Undying Thanks</strong> - to anyone who donates €1. We will eventually shuffle off this mortal coil, but our thanks will remain forever.</p>
<p>- <strong>Eternal Thanks</strong> - not just our thanks for all eternity, but your name in the thanks section of The Wild Word. And you know that's priceless. (But we've put a price on it, which is €5.)</p>
<p>- Our <strong>Love &amp; Resistance buttons</strong>, with artwork from the magazine's talented artist Ashling Keever. Because there's never been a better time to love and resist. For every €10 donation, we'll pop one in the post to wherever you are.</p>
<p>- For €15, you get <strong>eBook versions of our first poetry anthology</strong>, or if you prefer, <strong>our first fiction anthology</strong>. Featuring all the work we've published in the first year of the The Wild Word, these will be the first in an annual series.</p>
<p>- But why choose, when for €20, you can get <strong>both the poetry and the fiction eBook</strong>. Check out the way the covers fit together to make a set. They'll look so pretty on your kindle.</p>
<p>- For a €30 donation, you'll get both the <strong>eBook and the printed version </strong>of either the poetry or the fiction anthology.</p>
<p>One of our biggest loves at The Wild Word is the chance to nurture writers, and that's why we're offering two Writer's Perks.</p>
<p>For €10, we will offer you a full<strong> short story critique</strong>. Get feedback on what's working and what needs work, from the people who know.</p>
<p>For the bargain price of €100, we are offering <strong>full book manuscript critiques</strong>. This is a service that would normally cost at least €400. We will critique the characters, plot and story development of your masterpiece, whether it's in progress, or already completed.</p>
<p>And of course, we'll keep filling the magazine with <strong>great poetry, fiction, art and commentary every month</strong>, whether you donate or not. But please donate.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Your donations will make a big difference. They will help us to <strong>set up the publishing press</strong>, publish our <strong>first three books</strong>, and build a small <strong>shop</strong> on the magazine website to sell them.</p>
<p>This is the seed money that will help the magazine become self-supporting and profit-generating.</p>
<p>This is the kick-start for the magazine as a small business and not just a passion project.</p>
<p>We really believe in these projects and they're already underway. But a little help from our friends will go a long way.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>

I'm passionate about discovering strange and obscure places and cultures, and as a journalist, I always want to know all there is to know about the local life.

<p>South America is so much more than just an exotic destination. Indigenous Quechua women are discovering feminism, Andean shamans are falling in love with motorcycling, contemporary jazz is taking over Colombia and human rights activism is sweeping across Argentina.</p>
<p>At the same time, South America is home to lost legends of vanished tribes, Patagonian ghost stories, Andean myths, and Caribbean melancholy. Tales from South America is a mix of the everyday, the curious, and the fantastical.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","I'm Egle Gerulaityte, a traveler, a writer and a journalist. I'm passionate about discovering strange and obscure places and cultures, and as a journalist, I always want to know all there is to know about the local life. All around the world, people are so ordinary and extraordinary at the same time - and I love telling their stories, because it's the stories that connect us!

South America is so much more than just an exotic destination. Indigenous Quechua women are discovering feminism, Andean shamans are falling in love with motorcycling, contemporary jazz is taking over Colombia and human rights activism is sweeping across Argentina.
At the same time, South America is home to lost legends of vanished tribes, Patagonian ghost stories, Andean myths, and Caribbean melancholy. Tales from South America is a mix of the everyday, the curious, and the fantastical.
Publishing this book means the world to me. And to the people in the book, this means the world will get to hear their stories! 

If you back this project, not only you'll get an electronic or printed copy of the book, but you'll also help the actual people in the book - I've decided to donate 5% of the book sales to the people and families I met on the road.
Want to have a quick look before you back it? Download the first chapter of ""Tales from South America"" HERE!
What I Need & What You Get

To make Tales from South America a reality, I need:
- $1,500 to finish the research and revision of the book
- $2,000  to work with a professional editor
- $3,500 to publish & print the book
- $500 to cover shipping costs for sending out books 
- $600+ in IndieGoGo platform costs and fees
Backing this project, you'll get a whole bunch of unique perks including:
- the digital or printed version of the book
- a postcard from South America
- a motorcycle tour in Ecuador
- an opportunity to meet the actual people in the book
- a chance to be featured in the book yourself!
The Impact

Tales from South America: Everyday Life, People, and Legends has a simple but important message: around the world, ordinary people's lives can be made extraordinary through storytelling. 
If this project overfunds, I would love to include numerous illustrations in the book, produced by local South American artists!

As a freelance writer and journalist, I have successfully published these stories, among many others:
- Guna Yala: Islands Where Women Make All the Decisions, BBC Travel
- Venezuelan Refugee Crisis: A Glimpse, Egle On The Road
- Miraculous Hill of 100,000 Crosses, BBC Travel
- Last Leather Tanners of Ecuador, BBC Travel
I have also created and still edit an online magazine for women motorcyclists, Women ADV Riders, aimed at women who love travel, adventure, and motorcycling.
My first book, Testimony of a Vagabond - a predecessor to Tales from South America - was published in Lithuania in 2017.

I'm pouring my heart and soul into this book, and I hope you'll enjoy meeting all the incredible local people from Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile, Ecuador and Colombia!
There are some risks involved. Independent self-publishing can be a complicated process, but I am confident that with your support, I can make this book a reality.

<p>Last Pony on Earth was completed several years ago, but it left an indelible legacy on apocalyptic and post-collapse fiction that demands to be printed.

For years now I've been getting requests to do a print version of this book, and the time has finally come to fulfill that request. I've learned a great deal about printing and distribution during my first project, and I hope to be able to use that knowledge to bring this excellent story to everyone.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>With this project, we're setting out to get a deluxe hardcover print run of the apocalyptic fiction story Last Pony on Earth. Thanks to the lessons I learned during the Message in a Bottle print campaign, and the physical realities of this story (it isn't nearly as long), I will be printing two version of this book: a full color hardcover, and a black and white softcover. This way I expect LPoE to be within-reach of almost anyone interested in grabbing a copy.</p>
<p> </p>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562718350/gacsab9nrpqeyvvykbfx.jpg"" src=""""/></center>
<p> </p>
<p>The print will also contain approximately <strong>12,000 words of original fiction</strong> not to be published outside these physical prints, meant to connect the narrative of LPoE to the events of the sequel story, Founders of Alexandria--written in the original style and with new illustrations to go along with the story.</p>
<p>As you might expect, Zutcha will be reprising his role as the artist of the series.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562746830/qphrayobzp9dlprtv6gt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The funds raised will be used as follows:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The proof copies of the book and coverblock.</li>
<li>Original cover and illustrations.</li>
<li>Printing and distribution of the books themselves.</li>
</ol> <p>The book will contain minor corrections to the text made since the original publication, but otherwise will be identical to the story currently available on Fimfiction.net, save for the original content at the end.</p>
<p>Those who want to support the author a little could spring for an autographed copy, or support at the higher ""custom chapter"" tier, where I will write approximately 2,000 words of original PaP fiction about the subject of your choice. So long as it's in-universe, it need not be during this time period or even about Alex, unless you want it to be.</p>

<p>A word on custom chapters: The Last Pony on Earth narrative is a story much smaller in scope than my last book, and as a result I won't be able to add custom chapters into the physical print.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've learned a great deal about the systems involved in printing and distribution since my last project. I've learned real shipping costs, and the hardcover print proof has already been delivered (with the softcover on its way).</p>
<p>The only real risk I can think of is that the illustrations drawn for Last Pony on Earth were fairly small in pixel density as they were created spontaneously for the web.

</p><h3>About Caleb, The Entrepreneur</h3>
<p>Caleb is a very awesome 9 year old. At age 5, his parents started to teach him the basics about money and finance. His first exposure was going door to door in the community selling his healthy snacks. That first summer, he and his mom, went door to door, for about an hour and Caleb made $50 for his hour of work. He didn't even know how to count the change but his mom helped him out. :)<br/></p>
<p>He learned a few valuable lessons that summer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some people are mean. They shout and say no and close the door on you.</li>
<li>Don't let mean people discourage you. Just tell yourself to move along to the next person.</li>
<li>There are good people who are happy and willing to support.</li>
</ol><p><br/>His first experience, helped him to learn a basic principle about money and about relating to people. And he loved the experience. He also loves to watch Warren Buffet cartoons to learn some basic principles about money.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About Caleb, The Author</h3>
<p>Caleb wanted to write his own book after he saw his mom, also an author, with her book. He felt inspired. He wanted to have his own book for kids and so his dream was born. Caleb's parents have worked to try to foster and nurture the dream of this little guy. And in this nurturing, the Moshe Money and Elias Froggy book series was born.</p>

<div>Paper and Ink is a UK based literary zine that promotes good writing, presented on paper and printed in ink. Designed and edited by myself (Martin Appleby), the first issue launched in March 2013.

told through the biography of the man who proved, and sometimes disproved, many
""facts"" of that story. Dr. William M. Kelso has spent a half century
rediscovering, excavating, and interpreting archaeological sites of sweeping
global and historical importance. Primary among these is his most recent find:

<p><i>Phoenix
Summoned</i> is a story of adventure and discovery, as told through the life of
the man who is living it. For fifty years, Bill Kelso has been rediscovering
and excavating archaeological sites that reveal the origins of Virginia,
the United States,
and the British Empire. He has spent years digging under
the grueling sun and extreme temperatures—both high and low—which have, indeed,
turned him into the tough, physical man one would expect. But in addition to
his extensive fieldwork, he also has become an accomplished author, historian,
and spokesperson for his life's work—rewriting the history books by finding and
interpreting what many people only speculate about. He has written and lectured
extensively, earning numerous awards and honorary degrees, including the CBE,
or Honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire—Britain's second
highest civilian honor. <i>Phoenix Summoned</i>
explores this remarkable man's life, and as his contributions to archaeology
and history are revealed, the facts and myths about the birth of the United
States and the British Empire are exposed through the archaeological
evidence—the proof in the ground—he has brought back to light and life. This
biography relies on not only extensive research, but on my years of field
experience and discussions with Bill Kelso.</p>
<p>Because this biography is based on science and history, it
will appeal to scholars and practitioners in those areas. Archaeology
necessarily incorporates aspects of many disciplines, including geology, biology,
hydrology, chemistry, marine science, meteorology, dendrochronology, physics,
and even forensics, to name a few. Dr. Kelso's biography extends beyond those
""hard"" sciences, however, because his is a story of adventure and
discovery, and of mystery and wonder. Children are not the only ones with
gleams in their eyes and whispers or gasps of excitement when something not seen
in 400 years, or even thousands of years at some of his sites, is discovered
and carefully extracted from its hidden resting place. Older folks visit with
Dr. Kelso at his digs, too, and even they are awed by the findings and are
sometimes overwhelmed to be meeting the man who has become such a legend in his
field.</p>
<p><b>A bit about me (since Indiegogo said to include this!)</b></p>
<p>While earning the B.A. in anthropology and archaeology, with
minors in geology and French, I worked as an archaeologist on prehistoric sites
in southwestern Virginia (where I
first met Bill Kelso). Those studies and experiences gave me a solid foundation
in what is the background of this biography. Earning the M.A. in foreign
affairs at the University of Virginia
taught me advanced research and writing skills. After completing the Master's I
began work on a one-volume encyclopedia about Bill's premier site. To gain a
better understanding of the subject, and return to one of my favorite kinds of
work, I took Bill Kelso's archaeological field school at Jamestown
and then left to finish <i>Jamestown Colony</i>,
which includes entries about Bill Kelso's life and the archaeology at Jamestown.
Since returning to Bill's archaeology crew in early 2007, I've continued to
learn about Bill's life and contributions by working with him daily—digging
with him during the field season, and researching, writing, and editing for him
when not excavating. (Below is a picture of the Jamestown Rediscovery field crew. I'm third from the right.)<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/766166/files/20140804142705-jt_field_crew.jpg?1407187625"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>Although I have advanced training and experience in writing
nonfiction, I realized that to appeal to a wide audience, a narrative based in
science and history would have to be told in a style other than just a
statement of facts, analysis, and conclusions. Properly told, Bill Kelso's
life's story will be an intelligent, compelling adventure that will appeal to
not only a highly educated audience, but to a non-academically oriented one as
well. To this end, I completed courses in creative writing, resulting in a
substantial body of fiction in both prose and poetry, including a 20,000-word
core for a future novel. I hope to have this published about a year after
Bill's biography.</p>
<p>So, if you can see the importance of telling the story of the many
contributions Dr. Kelso has made to the archaeological and historical record of
the earliest years of what became the United States and the British Empire,
please consider helping support these efforts. I'll be forever grateful, and
the world will know the exciting story of a legendary life!</p>

Community Arts Projects and Productions <i>Black Like We:

<p>Blacks have the highest percentage of youth in Canada
and one quarter of Canadian-born Black youth don’t feel Canadian, since Blacks
are the target of 42% of hate crimes in Canada. Such alienation can lead to
mental illness and substance misuse. </p>
<p>For 78% of Black students, learning more about
their culture or race would make learning more interesting, and for 56% improve
their performance in school. With a 40% drop-out rate among Black students, our
community needs solutions.</p>
<p><span> Overrepresented in Canadian prisons,
Black inmates have requested reintegration program materials address their race
and cultural background as these have significant impact on their entering
prison. While Corrections staff disagreed, <i>Black
Like We</i> argues that going to prison is not a uniform experience. </span></p>
<p><span>In the book, you’ll hear from
Caribbean and continental African youth, with experiences of abuse,
incarceration, foster care, and trauma.  </span></p>
<p><span>Though our aim is not just to
publish a book, but rather to provide a resource.  With our first book, <i>Basodee: An Anthology Dedicated to Black Youth</i>, our goal was
expression. We had no idea its impact until we started getting requests to
speak to students.</span></p>
<p><span>Available in libraries, <i>Basodee</i> made the Recommended Book List
at the Toronto Public Library and Open Book Toronto. With your support and by building
on connections like these, we will get Black Like We into the hands of many of
the youth who need it.</span></p>
<p><span>In providing contributors with
mentorship and skills to facilitate workshops where they share their stories,
we want to impart the idea that professors aren’t the only ones writing books
for classrooms, but young people too. </span></p>
<p>A second book targeted to students, will enable the
formation of a self-sustaining group, funding workshops delivered in remote
communities through book sales, and help make <i>Black Like We</i> part of the curriculum.</p>
<p>Funds raised in this campaign will go towards
honorariums, workshops, and conducting outreach with the books to youth who
need it.</p>
<p><span><i>Black
Like We</i> creates a unique learning model, with youth voices empowered to
write solutions. Black feminist Chimamanda Adichie, warns against the danger of
the single story. Please give generously to this campaign which seeks to give
youth an opportunity to tell their stories. In the words of Alice Walker, “Our
people are waiting.”</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>

Blacks have the highest percentage of youth in Canada
and one quarter of Canadian-born Black youth don’t feel Canadian, since Blacks
are the target of 42% of hate crimes in Canada. Such alienation can lead to
mental illness and substance misuse. 
For 78% of Black students, learning more about
their culture or race would make learning more interesting, and for 56% improve
their performance in school. With a 40% drop-out rate among Black students, our
community needs solutions.
 Overrepresented in Canadian prisons,
Black inmates have requested reintegration program materials address their race
and cultural background as these have significant impact on their entering
prison. While Corrections staff disagreed, Black
Like We argues that going to prison is not a uniform experience. 
In the book, you’ll hear from
Caribbean and continental African youth, with experiences of abuse,
incarceration, foster care, and trauma.  
Though our aim is not just to
publish a book, but rather to provide a resource.  With our first book, Basodee: An Anthology Dedicated to Black Youth, our goal was
expression. We had no idea its impact until we started getting requests to
speak to students.
Available in libraries, Basodee made the Recommended Book List
at the Toronto Public Library and Open Book Toronto. With your support and by building
on connections like these, we will get Black Like We into the hands of many of
the youth who need it.
In providing contributors with
mentorship and skills to facilitate workshops where they share their stories,
we want to impart the idea that professors aren’t the only ones writing books
for classrooms, but young people too. 
A second book targeted to students, will enable the
formation of a self-sustaining group, funding workshops delivered in remote
communities through book sales, and help make Black Like We part of the curriculum.
Funds raised in this campaign will go towards
honorariums, workshops, and conducting outreach with the books to youth who
need it.
Black
Like We creates a unique learning model, with youth voices empowered to
write solutions. Black feminist Chimamanda Adichie, warns against the danger of
the single story. Please give generously to this campaign which seeks to give
youth an opportunity to tell their stories. In the words of Alice Walker, “Our
people are waiting.”

My name is Nathan Cadbury and I've been studying, applying and writing about various “self-help” topics for a few years now. But I've never been as excited about a project as I am about the ""Climb Any Mountain"" book.</p>
<p>I truly believe that what I've uncovered and compiled is a simple ""formula"" that works. It can work for anyone, anywhere, at any time to “set and get” virtually any goal they truly decide upon.</p>
<h3><strong>What Is It?</strong></h3>
<p><em>Climb Any Mountain</em> is essentially a 7-step system for achieving whatever one wants in life. It’s about waking up, taking charge and never looking back. This book represents the collective wisdom of many -- from years gone by, right up until the present day. I didn’t invent these concepts. I merely brought the pieces together in a way that makes sense and produces results.</p>
<p>It’s a “formula” for achieving meaningful goals. I’m not talking about “smart goals” or making those tiny, incremental improvements to one’s life. I’m talking about BIG DREAMS – goals worth going for with everything you’ve got... goals that make life exciting... and goals that change everything for the better.</p>
<p>Life can be like a giant jigsaw puzzle. But the problem is that we're missing the KEY PIECE -- the completed picture that shows how it all is supposed to come together in the end. That’s where <em>Climb Any Mountain</em> comes in with its step-by-step system. It’s gentle guidance and practical actions steps will enable anyone to overcome obstacles to achieve more and live life to the fullest – by their own definitions.</p>
<p>With your help, I'd like to share my discoveries and help people in a much grander way than I ever could do solo. I want to bring this book to life -- make it as good as it can be – and self-publish <em>Climb Any Mountain</em> to positively impact as many lives around the world as possible.</p>
<p>I invite you to be a part of this exciting journey. It’s an opportunity to make a positive contribution by showing others the way and leading them to fulfill their desires. Beyond basic life survival skills, I can't think of a more useful lesson to share -- and this one can serve the reader for a lifetime.</p>
<h3><strong>What You Get When You Back Me on This Project</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>My personal guarantee of delivery. This project will be completed as stated and on time.</li>
<li>A feeling of satisfaction and contribution. You can proudly say “I helped make this project happen”.</li>

<h3><strong>What I Bring to the Table</strong></h3>
<p>-          A keen interest in the subject and a passion for sharing helpful ideas</p>
<p>-          Experience in writing, self-publishing and marketing</p>
<p>-          A completed, detailed outline covering each chapter of the book</p>
<h3><strong>What I Need</strong></h3>
<p>I’m seeking funding for the following elements of this project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Professional Cover Design (A skilled designer can make a world of difference to a book’s sales and the more it sells, the more effective the impact of one’s message.)</li>
<li>Editing and Proofing (Another important part – not just as far as sales and reviews go – but to enhance the reader’s overall experience with a more professional product.)</li>
<li>Marketing and Promotion (Virtually all successful books have been supported by effective marketing and promotions and doing it the right way costs money.)</li>
<li>An initial print run of 2000 copies to increase the book’s distribution and exposure</li>
</ol><h3><strong>The Impact of Your Contribution</strong></h3>
<p>With your help, you become not just a sponsor, but a collaborator. – Your valued assistance enables me to package and present this important message of goal achievement and breakthrough success in a way that interests, engages and powerfully impacts people.</p>
<p>I’m committed to this project 100%. It will see the light of day – rain or shine. There’s no question about it. I’ve written and published 4 books to date in the “self-help” category. But I feel in my heart that this is THE ONE that’s going to breakthrough and connect with the largest, global audience yet.</p>
<p>With your support, <em>Climb Any Mountain</em> can impact many lives. I sense that the “trick” to reaching a larger audience is to make a splash and do it up right – in fine style. And that’s what professional design and editing will do. It makes sense because a quality publication tends to get more respect, more attention and more buzz in the marketplace. In turn, this means the message within can potentially serve more people – wherever on this beautiful planet they happen to live.</p>
<p>Contributing to this project makes you part of something positive and life-enhancing in a world that at times, can appear anything but. My unique approach makes setting and getting meaningful goals a realistic and worthwhile endeavour for anyone with the desire for something more.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to check out this campaign – VERY COOL of you. And I would sincerely like to THANK YOU for your fantastic support! Every dollar counts and I assure you that each contribution will help make this a better quality product and get this “formula” into more hands that need it.</p>
<p>If you are temporarily short of cash at the present time and can’t contribute, I understand. (Believe me, I do!) Or, if you prefer to wait until the book is published before claiming your own copy, that’s fine too. However, there IS a way you could be a HUGE HELP today and ensure the success of <em>Climb Any Mountain</em> – here’s how:</p>
<p>Please let your family, friends, colleagues and acquaintances know about this campaign. Call, email, blog about it, chat up your co-workers at the water cooler or coffee machine – or use the Share Buttons on this page to help spread the word. However you choose to help – I thank you VERY MUCH and appreciate this more than you know.</p></div>","Hello!

<h3>A world first...</h3>
<p>Hi fellow nurses and welcome to the website that is the base for the upcoming ""nurses fyi"" magazine that will be launched via Apple's Newsstand for your iPad.</p>
<p>I have been nursing for 25 years (the past 13 in Patient Transport) and I am excited to be in the planning phase of what I believe to be the worlds first electronic international nurses magazine.</p>
<p>I have launched a Crowd funding campaign over at <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.indiegogo.com/nursesfyi</a>  to raise the necessary funds ($2,500) to bring the nurses magazine into reality and to cover the production and setup costs for the first four monthly editions.</p>
<p>The initial edition will be free and then each subsequent monthly edition will be $3.99 (about the cost of a cup of coffee) to help cover costs.</p>
<p>The magazine will have stories by nurses for nurses from all over the world. It will look to build a community of nurses who enjoy reading about issues and topics that unite nurses the world over.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul><ul>
<li>Nurses fyi Crowd funding Figures:</li>
</ul></ul>
<p>1/ Production costs for first four editions     $1200</p>
<p>2/ Company setup   $483</p>
<p>3/ Legal contract for submissions to magazine      $250</p>
<p>4/ Advertising     <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$300</span></p>
<p>                                                         Total   <strong>$2,233</strong></p>
<p><strong>  </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Perks:  Your help will ensure the success of this project.</li>
<ul>
<li>For a $10 donation your name will be added to the ""Bronze Supporter"" section of both the nurses fyi website and in the first four editions of the magazine.</li>
<li>For a $20 donation your name will be added to the ""Silver Supporter"" section of both the nurses fyi website and in the first four editions of the magazine.</li>
<li>For a $50 donation your name will be added to the ""Gold Supporter"" section of both the nurses fyi website and in the first four editions of the magazine.</li>
<li>For a $100 donation your name will be added to the ""Platinum Supporter"" section of both the nurses fyi website and in the first four editions of the magazine.</li>
<li>For a $350 donation ""Advertisers Special"" your company’s story (logo, pictures, video, text, link to website) of how your company helps nurses will be added to Advertisers section of the first four editions of the magazine ($87.50/edition).</li>
</ul>
<li>If just $1200 is raised one edition will be launched and additional funding sought.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p> <strong>This will be the first international digital nurses magazine by nurses for nurses.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This project will fill what I believe to be the void that currently exists for nurses everywhere to be able to have ready access to an international nurses magazine with issues and topics that we want to read about in a digital magazine that you can carry with you on the iPad.</li>

</div></div>","A world first...
Hi fellow nurses and welcome to the website that is the base for the upcoming ""nurses fyi"" magazine that will be launched via Apple's Newsstand for your iPad.
I have been nursing for 25 years (the past 13 in Patient Transport) and I am excited to be in the planning phase of what I believe to be the worlds first electronic international nurses magazine.
I have launched a Crowd funding campaign over at www.indiegogo.com/nursesfyi  to raise the necessary funds ($2,500) to bring the nurses magazine into reality and to cover the production and setup costs for the first four monthly editions.
The initial edition will be free and then each subsequent monthly edition will be $3.99 (about the cost of a cup of coffee) to help cover costs.
The magazine will have stories by nurses for nurses from all over the world. It will look to build a community of nurses who enjoy reading about issues and topics that unite nurses the world over.
What We Need & What You Get
Break it down for folks in more detail:

Nurses fyi Crowd funding Figures:

1/ Production costs for first four editions     $1200
2/ Company setup   $483
3/ Legal contract for submissions to magazine      $250
4/ Advertising     $300
                                                         Total   $2,233
  

Perks:  Your help will ensure the success of this project.

For a $10 donation your name will be added to the ""Bronze Supporter"" section of both the nurses fyi website and in the first four editions of the magazine.
For a $20 donation your name will be added to the ""Silver Supporter"" section of both the nurses fyi website and in the first four editions of the magazine.
For a $50 donation your name will be added to the ""Gold Supporter"" section of both the nurses fyi website and in the first four editions of the magazine.
For a $100 donation your name will be added to the ""Platinum Supporter"" section of both the nurses fyi website and in the first four editions of the magazine.
For a $350 donation ""Advertisers Special"" your company’s story (logo, pictures, video, text, link to website) of how your company helps nurses will be added to Advertisers section of the first four editions of the magazine ($87.50/edition).

If just $1200 is raised one edition will be launched and additional funding sought.

The Impact
 This will be the first international digital nurses magazine by nurses for nurses.

This project will fill what I believe to be the void that currently exists for nurses everywhere to be able to have ready access to an international nurses magazine with issues and topics that we want to read about in a digital magazine that you can carry with you on the iPad.
As the magazine will be about everything nursing...nurses will be able to read articles and stories, view videos, join webinars and make submissions for consideration to be included in future editions of the magazine. 
I am very confident I have the ability and determination to carry this project through to completion...and by doing so I will be fulfilling a dream of mine.
I have previously been a paid blogger for a professional nursing blog (nurses uncut), so I can write engaging nursing articles for nurses on a variety of nursing topics.
I have already built the website for the magazine www.nursesfyi.com

I have a professional production company teed up to produce this magazine (they have 150 magazines already in Apple's Newsstand).
I have been trained at NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Arts) a prestigious film school to produce short films that will help record and edit videos I want to add to the magazine.

<h3>Lies, Damned Lies<br/>
</h3>
<p>Hello, I'm Greg Crites, author of twenty-three novels, none of which made the New York Times bestseller lists and never will because there is a worldwide conspiracy to destroy me. My enemies are legion. Death awaits me around every corner... what? Oh. Forget all that other stuff above. I thought this was my bio for a conspiracy site. Yes, 23 novels. I wrote 'em. I created audiobooks from them. Over two-million downloads of those chapters. Thousands upon thousands of audiobooks sold and enjoyed. I don't submit to others. I don't seek agents, deals, blurbs, advertising, sponsors (unless you are a liquor distributor, then let's talk) This is a one-man operation run out of wherever I happen to be.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Will happen<br/>
</h3>
<p>Readers/listeners wish me to finish writing this book, while I wish to continue drinking undisturbed. It's an impasse that only be forded by paying me an advance. If we can successfully fund this venture I'll be left with no choice other than to finish the thing.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need liquor money. No. Ignore that. I need money to print copies of Crusade II. Being a small firm whose primary investments are tied up in rum bottles, err.. stock derivatives, I can't afford to print books. Yeah, that's it. I need money to print the books.<br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Help get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Use these stupid 'share' tools. I'm not on Facebook, so I'm relying on you to make some noise over there.</p>
