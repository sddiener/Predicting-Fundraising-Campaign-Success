<h3>LET’S TALK ABOUT THE PROJECT</h3>
<p>Let’s Shojo is not a comic, nor a manga or comic strip, but a mix of all of them. It’s a collection of one shots each of which is parody of a different genres of manga (in particular the shojo), for instance, there is a maho shojo, a yaoi story, but also an harem reverse and ecchi ones and much more.<br/>In this comic, the main characters, Sybil and Cloud, are forced by an author obsessed with shojo manga to perform every sort of shojo. They should be able to count on the help of “The Brutes”…between a soccer game and another…<br/>Will our heroes survive the shojo mangas?</p>
<p>Let’s Shojo is black and white and roughly 160 pages of sheer fun!</p>

<h3>SO HOW DOES INDIEGOGO WORKS?</h3>
<p>Over in the top right corner of this page is the goal. That's how much I will need to product and translate (I need to pay a Italian-English translator because my English isn’t perfect as you can see) my comic.<br/>If the goal is reached, I’ll start to product and translate “Let’s shojo”, at the moment I’ve drawn my comic in Italian on paper sheets.<br/>If the goal is exceeded, it will mean more comic will be produced! Every dollar over the goal line means a larger quantity of “Let’s shojo” can be ordered.<br/>If the goal is not reached before the end of the 60 days then you will not be charged anything. You only pay if the project reaches its goal before the deadline!</p>

<p>My Sweet Lady<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> is an action-adventure comedy comic book series about a country full of personified pastry people with a diet of only meat. The target audience for this series is 13 and up, both male and female. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>My Sweet Lady<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> is a great name for this series because it describes the comic perfectly. The story is about Lady White Cake, a cake personification who is trying to be sweet in order to gain the affection of her citizens. When it comes to the title of this series, “Sweet” is a play on words that can be defined in two different ways; sweet as in the setting of the story, which takes place in a land full of pastry people, and sweet as in a personality trait. Join Lady White on her journey to become a “likable” person through the teachings of an innocent Cupcake. Some of the traits that Lady White will learn on her adventures are honesty, compassion, integrity, generosity, love, selflessness, willingness to protect others, friendship, and sacrifice.</span></p>

Her father, the king, has suddenly died and now Lady will take his place as queen. Although Lady is a princess, she is rude, antisocial and just plain mean to everyone.

The story focuses on a cake princess with a rotten attitude named Lady White Cake, and her quest to transform into someone that everyone will love and respect with the help of her little friend, Cupcake. Due to the sudden and mysterious death of Lady White’s father, the King, she will have to take his place as ruler of her kingdom in a month's time, while uncovering the truth behind her father's death. Every chapter of MSL will be published (printed) in full-color comic book issues.

$11,000 Trade shows, promotional events and book shows including travel expenses
$500 Office/admin supplies
Asking for $3500 to assist us in our business operations outlined above.

All (100%) funds raised in this campaign will go into this project.  None of the money raised on this campaign will go into our pockets. We will only retain profits from the sales of each issue.



My Sweet Lady is an action-adventure comedy comic book series about a country full of personified pastry people with a diet of only meat. The target audience for this series is 13 and up, both male and female. 


My Sweet Lady is a great name for this series because it describes the comic perfectly. The story is about Lady White Cake, a cake personification who is trying to be sweet in order to gain the affection of her citizens. When it comes to the title of this series, “Sweet” is a play on words that can be defined in two different ways; sweet as in the setting of the story, which takes place in a land full of pastry people, and sweet as in a personality trait. Join Lady White on her journey to become a “likable” person through the teachings of an innocent Cupcake. Some of the traits that Lady White will learn on her adventures are honesty, compassion, integrity, generosity, love, selflessness, willingness to protect others, friendship, and sacrifice.
The reader may even learn a thing or two about how to treat people by reading MSL.

Lady White Cake is a young princess who is destined to rule over a land of pastry people who have a diet of only meat. Her father, the king, has suddenly died and now Lady will take his place as queen. Although Lady is a princess, she is rude, antisocial and just plain mean to everyone. No one in the kingdom respects her and she will have to find a way to gain that respect.  



Cupcake is a little girl who lives in the land of the pastry people. She is the niece of Lady White Cake’s bodyguard. Cupcake is the only pastry in the entire kingdom who admires Lady White Cake; this is mostly due to her naiveté. She will become Lady’s only friend and she will show Lady how to be a good person and how to have fun through their many adventures in the kingdom.

Scotchy Brown (Butlerscotch) is one of Lady White’s bodyguards and Cupcake's uncle. Lady White Cake and Scotchy butt heads a lot.  They do tend to make friendly bets with each other often during the boring events they attend.  He’s not a very fun person to be around because he is always so serious.

<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Nobsland is a comic series I created since 2009, I have written more than 50 episodes so far, each of the stories has 4 panels in a single page, which looks like a full page newspaper layout (because I hearted the comic strips on newspaper).

<h3>Sophie goes on tour!</h3>
<p>Hello Everyone! My name is <strong>Sophie Labelle</strong>, the French-Canadian artist behind Assigned Male, a webcomic about a bunch of sarcastic trans and queer teenagers that has been running since 2014. I've also been giving talks and doing events all over the place in the past few years! In 2020, it's reaching new heights with my first actual World Tour, for which I've been receiving invitations on every continent of the world.</p>
<p>As a trans woman, I feel very privileged to be able to do this. In the past, every speaking tour I did allowed me to meet members from trans, queer and feminist communities of so many various backgrounds that every time, I've been learning and growing so much from these encounters.  And this time, I'd like to share that experience with everyone!</p>
<p><strong>That's why I'll be consigning stories from my world tour into illustrated letters, which I'll send you, the backers, by physical mail or email.</strong> Then, at the end of the tour, I will turn these letters into chapters of a <strong>tour book, with more drawings!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>How will it work?</h3>
<p>Obviously, the funds raised will mainly go toward the <strong>printing of the book</strong>, which is estimated to be about 200 pages at the end. I have self-published more than a dozen books already, and estimate the costs to be around 10ca$/unit. I'd like to print at least 1000 of them, so that's why 10,000ca$ (7,500us$) is the minimum.</p>
<p>The rest of the funds will help fund <strong>the tour itself</strong>, since many trans organisations who will be hosting me don't have the means to pay for the traveling part. I am doing all this by myself, with no agent, and working closely with each organisation that invite me.</p>
<p>You will <strong>receive 12 letters/emails</strong> from February to June, each corresponding to a country or region I'll be visiting during the tour. These different parts are each described in the Chapters section!</p>
<p>If we reach the<strong> second goal,</strong> which will be announced in an update once and if the first goal is reached, everyone who signed up for a book will get it hardcover!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>So is it like a travel guide?</h3>
<p>My goal with this project is to share the stories I'm collecting from my point of view as a traveling trans artist.</p>
<p>When I was a teenager, the idea of traveling while trans seemed to be a risky one, and the risk is real. Violence exists everywhere, but so do we. </p>
<p>This project isn't a travel log, and even less some ethno-sociological study. It's an art project, which will revolve around <strong>encounters and anecdotes,</strong> and will remain entirely subjective to my own experiences, perceptions and emotions. </p>
<p>It will also be limited by which organizations invited me for this tour, which, sadly, need an internet connection, access to specific social media in order to be familiar with my work online, and to be located in a country without laws that forbid their existence.</p>
<p>This tour doesn't include any country of the Americas, which I will tour later in the coming year. If this campaign is successful, I'll consider making a similar project then!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>White Canadian citizen breezing through borders, how nice</h3>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the point of view that I have is very privileged : being white and holding a Canadian passport opens many doors. This tour and the stories I will share from it are going to be heavily influenced by that. This project might not even be doable for someone else in another situation!</p>
<p>That's why I decided to <strong>give 5% of the funds raised to ""Black and Pink""</strong>, an organization close to my heart which runs different programs for jailed or homeless queer and trans youth. You can donate, volunteer, learn more or even become a penpal with an incarcerated queer or trans person here : <a href=""https://www.blackandpink.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.blackandpink.org/</a> .</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Pledging isn't the only way to help! Sharing the campaign on social media goes a long way. You can also show up at the events - most of them will be pinned on my Facebook page, at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/assignedmale"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/assignedmale</a> .</p>
<h3>Chapter list</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, this list doesn't include any country or region from the Americas, which will come later - you can however already message me about it!</p>

<p>We will be working with a US printer and fulfilment service this means we’re not getting as large a slice is the pie as others but this is the safest way of going about my first book.</p> <p><strong>Where is my money going?</strong></p>

Risks & Challenges

We are new at this
It’s true that we are both first time comic book makers that’s why we’ve done the research and put in the work. We’ve done a 48 page test run to prove we can do it we watched the videos read the PDFs, we are avoiding the first major problem which is random crap we wanna make a comic book we don’t wanna make T-shirts, The book is the only product we are manufacturing printing standing behind we just made this project 100% more likely to succeed. Failure to deliver
We will be working with a US printer and fulfilment service this means we’re not getting as large a slice is the pie as others but this is the safest way of going about my first book. Where is my money going?
The bulk of the money is going towards printing and distribution The rest is going to the artist Aidan.",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Who is Grant Reed?</strong></p>
<p>Born on May 6, 1976 in North Bay Ontario, my twin (Gary) and I, have always felt the creative urge that differentiates us from our peers. As a kid, I always had a book in my hand and took my share of ribbing that went along with being a passionate reader and having the last name of Reed. (No I have never really understood this, but kids can be cruel…sometimes it’s best to play along.)</p>
<p>By the age of twelve I knew I wanted to tell stories. Inspired by David Gemmell, writers of the Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance novels, and anything with a fantastical flair – be it film or written word –I armed myself with the knowledge and skills it would take to tell my own story.</p>
<p>In 1999, after two years of hard work, I finished my first novel entitled “Shadow of the Makarios”. I had accomplished what I set out to do, and feverishly hit the streets trying to sell my work. Dozens of rejections later, and with the need to put food on the table for my young family, I reluctantly, ever so slowly and painfully… gave up on the dream….almost. </p>
<p>I have since written three other novels in the fantasy genre, (two with Gary) but have had little success in promoting these titles. (If success were measured by the wall of rejections I have acquired over the years, then I would be triumphant. I’ll know when I have reached my goal though, for the wall will cease to grow. Either I will have finally found someone interested in my work or I will have dropped dead from trying.)</p>
<p>Despite the fact I have not fulfilled my dreams as a writer, I refuse to give up. Over the years a little nagging moth has flitted around the inside of my head promoting the idea of a graphic novel to get the story of “Shadow of the Makarios” out there so that people could enjoy it. You are, after all, the reason I wrote it.</p>
<p>Working fourteen hour days seven days a week for the past three months I have endeavored to create something I could share with you. Now as my contract with the I.T. company I work for comes to an end I am faced with finding new work, or once again attempting to pursue my one true love of storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>What I need</strong></p>
<p>I have taken into consideration the bare minimum income I will need for the next year to pay my bills, and combined that with printing cost to do an initial run of “Shadow of the Makarios” the Graphic Novel – volume 1. (As well as printing costs for the original novel and artwork for perks).</p>
<p>I need $28,000 of which $10,000 covers the printing costs (300 novels and 300 Graphic novels and Art) and a further $2000 pays off the Fees for this site.</p>
<p>I also need another 12 months to finish Volume 1. I have completed 20% of Volume 1 while working a full time job as well as 6 hours a night on the comic (every night) to do so. If I am able to work on this full time, I may even finish sooner than expected.</p>
<p><strong>What you get</strong></p>
<p>You get a top quality 150 page full color signed copy of “Shadow of the Makarios” the graphic novel Volume 1.</p>
<p>You also get the original “Shadow of the Makarios” a full 458 pages, an original novel by Grant Reed.</p>
<p>You get continued entertainment from a man who has dedicated many years of his life to telling fantastical tales for your enjoyment. Please help keep the dream alive, and I will keep working hard to entertain YOU!</p>

<h3>JUDGES: A NEO NOIR CRIME THRILLER</h3>
<p>Judges is a passion project for our team.  We've been working on this story for over a year and a half and have 8 issues fully mapped out and written.  Judges is an anthology at heart -- it revolves around a key set of characters, with many others coming and going.  </p>
</div><div>
<p>Our main characters are:</p>
<p>Lukas Seek -- The son of a murdered vigilante.  He's looking for his father's killer.</p>
<p>Royal -- A mysterious former bank robber that offers Lukas an intriguing deal.</p>
<p>Alex Mullen -- An alcoholic, depressed Remorse detective.  He's thrust right into the middle of many of our character's stories.</p>
<p>Azrael -- She fights for the abused women in Remorse.  The first time we meet her, she's preventing a rape.  She was abused by her stepfather as a child, so she knows that pain and aims to stop it.</p>
<p>The Handsome Bastard -- Handsome was former military &amp; CIA.  His daughter was kidnapped for sex-trafficking purposes and never seen again.  He now fights the Siete Cartel's sex trafficking rackets, vowing to end it for good.</p>
<p>This story takes each of these characters to multiple locations in our Universe; a bank robbery in Grayedge, a temple in Mexico, an FBI morgue in New York, and a radical church in Athens (we're even planning an arch that takes some of our characters to Bruges, but that's a secret, so shh!).  </p>
<p>These characters cross paths with many others, such as a vengeful FBI agent, a former Navy SEAL turned cartel enforcer, and a crazy and powerful woman at the head of the cartel, only know as ""La Bruja"".</p>
<h3>OUR GOALS</h3>
<p><br/>One of the big goals with Judges is to bring light to some dark issues that are close to our hearts.  The Handsome Bastard was kind of transformed into this character that's sole purpose in life was fighting sex trafficking.  </p>
<p>We talked about this for a while and realized that when people think of sex trafficking, usually it's accompanied by, ""Oh, that happens to them.  That happens over there.""  But it happens in our own backyards.  It happens everywhere.  And we want people to see that and decide to do something about it.</p>
<p>With Azrael, we wanted to create a strong woman that women &amp; girls alike could look up to.  And while some of the things she does may be unsavory, she is fighting for the abused women and girls in Remorse.</p>
<p>Judges is dark &amp; gritty, but also has some tender moments between characters.  It's really one big character study, set in a harsh and unforgiving city.  We dive into the fundamentals of what can happen to good people when they're surrounded by so much evil and hatred.</p>
<p>We hope this story has a little something for everyone.</p>

<h2>Peter Pan and me!</h2>
<p>Why am I the right guy for the job?  Why is this story so special to me?</p>
<p>Well..to me, PETER PAN is the greatest story in the world, and one I have been hooked on (no pun intended!) since I was a small boy...</p>
<p>It's all a bit embarrassing really, but what the hey!  I am asking you for contributions here, so the least I can do is bare a little of my soul in return...so here goes!</p>
<p>When I was a little boy I was completely obsessed with Peter Pan!  I used to dress up as Peter (remember I was only five!) and my costume was complete with green tights and glitter for fairy dust.  So convinced was I that I actually WAS PETER PAN, that I used to try and climb out of my bedroom window and fly away!  I did this so often that my Uncle had to put bars on it!  Unfortunately, he put them on horizontally, and I used them as a ladder to get even higher!</p>
<p>As a treat, I was taken to see PETER PAN in pantomime at the King's Theatre in Edinburgh.  It is my earliest memory!  Not because I sat through the entire show spellbound, as you might imagine...rather, because of the moment of Peter's entrance.  He had just appeared as a silhouette behind the bedroom window, when...BAM!  The fire curtain came down, blocking off the stage.  There was a fire in the theatre and everybody was evacuated!</p>

<h3>An exciting new project creating a faithful graphic novel adaptation of J.M.Barrie’s classic story, Peter Pan, generating funds for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity!</h3>
<p>Not sure what a graphic novel is?  Basically, a graphic novel is a full lenght comic book story, in the tradition of the Tintin or Asterix books.</p>
<p>Can you believe there is no graphic novel adaptation of this Peter Pan already?!! The story is ideal for adaptation into this popular medium, and like J. M. BARRIE'S original book, it will appeal to both children and adults alike, for all time!</p>
<p>My adaptation will be faithful to the original vision of the author, which is darker in tone than the Disney version that the majority of the world is familiar with.  It will also contain scenes from the book that were not included in Disney's version!</p>
<p><strong>YOU</strong> can help bring this much loved work to a new generation in a format they will relish, and offer a fresh vision to other generations already familiar with the story.</p>
<p id=""yui_3_2_0_25_133889734258789""><strong>YOU</strong> will be generating funds for GREAT ORMOND STREET HOSPITAL CHILDREN'S CHARITY by doing so...</p>

<h2><strong>Ready to begin!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>THE SCRIPT:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The adapted script is already written </strong>and has been read by several other professionals, including Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity, and former editor of THE DANDY, Morris Heggie, who has over forty years experience. I have many professional colleagues at hand for expert advice and support with all aspects of, and through all stages of this project.</p>
<p><strong>THE ARTWORK:</strong></p>
<p>I intend a classic visual style for the book, that will make it timeless...think Winsor McCay  (Little Nemo in Slumberland) meets Herge (Tintin). </p>

<h2><strong>Funding and perks!</strong></h2>
<p>I am asking for $32,000, or £20,800 to make this project happen. Yes, that's a lot of money...why so much?</p>
<p>Because the project will take me a full year to complete!  I'm going to pour all my love for Peter Pan into this project, and I intend to produce two high quality pages of artwork per week. This will allow me the time I need to make them as good as they need to be!</p>
<p>The finished book will be 96 pages long (full colour), which breaks the total down to an individual page rate of $333 or £216.  I have written the adaptation myself, and will also be the penciler, inker, colourist, letterer and graphic designer of the project .</p>
<p>Any professional will tell you this is a very reasonable page rate for this amount of work.</p>
<p>The fund total will also cover the cost of printing and postage for the first edition copies of the book.  These will be signed, numbered, and issued exclusively to those that have claimed the book as a perk! </p>
<p>Please remember, the book will take a year to produce, so most of the perks are long-term. The high resolution images will be available instantly.  Every one who contributes more $5 or more will receive these as soon as the campain ends successfully!</p>

Firstly, let me thank you for taking the time to check out what I hope you will agree is an exciting new project.  This book is something I believe in passionately, and have been working towards for many years.
So sit back, relax, and join me on a trip to the most magical world ever imagined...

So...what is crowdfunding all about? 
Simple!  Take a look at my project, and if you believe in it, you can help make it happen with a contribution...and grab yourself an awesome perk at the same time!
Your conrtibution is helping to fund the actual creation of the book.  Every contributor to this project will be a part of this book forever!
Now let me make this clear, straight off...I do not intend to make money from sales of this book.  For me, reaching my fund total and having the opportunity to create this book is enough.
All my royalties from sales of this  book will be donated to Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity (GOSH)...for all time! This means that a small contribution to my project from you can turn in to a larger donation to GOSH from me...this book really could be the gift to them that keeps on giving! 
When J M Barrie died, he left all the rights to Peter Pan to GOSH.

An exciting new project creating a faithful graphic novel adaptation of J.M.Barrie’s classic story, Peter Pan, generating funds for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity!
Not sure what a graphic novel is?  Basically, a graphic novel is a full lenght comic book story, in the tradition of the Tintin or Asterix books.
Can you believe there is no graphic novel adaptation of this Peter Pan already?!! The story is ideal for adaptation into this popular medium, and like J. M. BARRIE'S original book, it will appeal to both children and adults alike, for all time!
My adaptation will be faithful to the original vision of the author, which is darker in tone than the Disney version that the majority of the world is familiar with.  It will also contain scenes from the book that were not included in Disney's version!
YOU can help bring this much loved work to a new generation in a format they will relish, and offer a fresh vision to other generations already familiar with the story.
YOU will be generating funds for GREAT ORMOND STREET HOSPITAL CHILDREN'S CHARITY by doing so...

Ready to begin!
THE SCRIPT:
The adapted script is already written and has been read by several other professionals, including Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity, and former editor of THE DANDY, Morris Heggie, who has over forty years experience. I have many professional colleagues at hand for expert advice and support with all aspects of, and through all stages of this project.
THE ARTWORK:
I intend a classic visual style for the book, that will make it timeless...think Winsor McCay  (Little Nemo in Slumberland) meets Herge (Tintin). 

Funding and perks!
I am asking for $32,000, or £20,800 to make this project happen. Yes, that's a lot of money...why so much?
Because the project will take me a full year to complete!  I'm going to pour all my love for Peter Pan into this project, and I intend to produce two high quality pages of artwork per week. This will allow me the time I need to make them as good as they need to be!
The finished book will be 96 pages long (full colour), which breaks the total down to an individual page rate of $333 or £216.  I have written the adaptation myself, and will also be the penciler, inker, colourist, letterer and graphic designer of the project .
Any professional will tell you this is a very reasonable page rate for this amount of work.
The fund total will also cover the cost of printing and postage for the first edition copies of the book.  These will be signed, numbered, and issued exclusively to those that have claimed the book as a perk! 
Please remember, the book will take a year to produce, so most of the perks are long-term. The high resolution images will be available instantly.  Every one who contributes more $5 or more will receive these as soon as the campain ends successfully!

Other ways to help!
Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help!
If you can't contribute financially to this project, you can help by spreading the word!  Please Tweet, blog and Facebook this project around. You can also visit/like/share the Facebook page, Pan by Stref'.
Thanks for taking the time to look at my project.  I hope you decide to become part of it, and join me on this magical adventure to bring Peter Pan to life in a new format!

Nate has spent months developing the entire series to ensure that readers will engulf themselves in the intense science fiction odyssey that is Project: M.O.T.H.E.R. Nate has teamed up with some of the hottest artists in the industry to create this epic on going monthly title.Jimbo Salgado of IDW Fame, along with Kate Finnegan the colorist for the growing popular title The Legend of Oz: The Wicked West, and with several other up and coming stars of the industry. At first the goal was to make the comic series, but now it has evolved into a project that is going to help struggling artists in the industry. Nate has started his own label known as STRICK 9 COMICS and its his goal to help writers meet artists  that normally wouldn't have the chance of doing so. He wants to kickstart the industry into a new age with more creator owned titles than ever before.</p>
<p>As for what our first goal is, the $8,500.00 will be used for paying for the Artists, Coloroists and Letterers' cost to help sell our comic. We have two more goals. One, if we can raise $18,000.00 then we can get 2 issues out and make our title a self sustaining title and two, if we can raise $38,000.00 than we can start making our way to various Conventions to meet all of you, our fans, and make new ones on the way. If we hit our other two unofficial goals than we will be increasing the rewards with several very unique special rewards also, the profits of Project: M.O.T.H.E.R. will also go to helping fund other creator owned comics.</p>
<p>Now on to a little bit about Project: M.O.T.H.E.R. Issue #1</p>
<p>M.O.T.H.E.R. 4 was created by a ancient race known as the Plutarians. The Plutarians were a civil race with rich knowledge of science and mathematics. The whole purpose of the Plutarians life was the pursuit of knowledge. They had sent out Mobile Operation Space Informational Robots into all of the galaxies to find out about alien civilazations. On one of the planets a M.O.S.I.R. Unit had visited it was destroyed in an alien invasion. These aliens are known as the Winshai, lead by their emperor Lem Jei. The Plutarians feared that this was going to happen to their planet. With the knowledge they had obtained from all of the M.O.S.I.R. Units they created the M.O.T.H.E.R Units (Mobile Operations Time Hopping Enforcement Robot) to protect their planet and all of the valuable knowledge  they had obtained.  M.O.T.H.E.R. 4 was sent to TXR-12, a Human Colony, to infiltrate the Winshai Empire. M.O.T.H.E.R. 4 is designed to take down the Winshai Empire from the inside out. </p>
<p>Once on TXR-12, M.O.T.H.E.R.4 assumes the identity of Donna Walsh, a politician of the TXR-12 Senate. The Plutarians had found out Ms. Walsh had gone missing during this time and she would make a prime candidate for M.O.T.H.E.R.4. To work her way into the Winshai Empire. M.O.T.H.E.R.4 started to work her way up the ranks and then hit a bump in the road. Donna Walsh was found alive and it would compromise her covert operations. M.O.T.H.E.R decided to use her time hopping device and hop back in time 1 day before Donna was found. This is where issue 1 starts off.</p>
<p>We plan on making the first issue and distributing it thru Toledo Publishing. The Challenge is the $8500.00,which is what I need to pay the artists to make this happen. The other is that if we can make $18,000.00 so we can make sure that this wonderful comic will become a self sustaining title. The first months returns will pay for the third months comics, and the second months returns will pay for the fourth months returns and so on and so forth. If we can raise $38,000.00 than we can start making our way to various Conventions to meet all of you, our fans, and make new ones on the way. Then with the profits that are left over we can start funding our other titles that you as a fan will love to read!</p>

<p><b>The Intro </b></p>
<p>My name is Christina Escamilla. I am a queer feminist Latina author and publisher with interests in the creepy, macabre, and disturbing. While little bits of myself can be found in all of my writing, the Horror Queen graphic novel is especially drawn from many key moments of my life, including surviving trauma and managing mental illness.  A lot of the supernatural elements found in the novel are allegories with dealing with these issues. Not only that but I have also partnered with my cocreators and besties Dane Ashton and Ibrahim Alhebeba to bring you the most compelling storyline possible.</p>

<p><br/><i>All that is needed is for them to gather the twelve talents, scattered across the world.</i></p>

When I began my journey into adulthood, I could not find enough characters that reflected my struggles with mental illness and trauma. I decided that if I did not write mine and my friends' stories, that nobody would. What I did not expect was to have random strangers tell me that my characters felt real, and that they could relate to them. By supporting my writing and this campaign, you will be bringing relatable characters into the lives of people who do not see themselves in mainstream media.</p>

<h3>what is the summer of Blake Sinclair?</h3>
<p><strong>The Summer of Blake Sinclair</strong> <strong>is an online slice of life/social sattire comic.</strong> So far the comic is 10 chapters long! remember that you can read it online for free, here; <a href=""http://blake-sinclair.smackjeeves.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://blake-sinclair.smackjeeves.com</a></p>
<p>it is set in the summer between University terms and follows the life of a student and his friends.</p>
<p>the comic was based closely on my expriences at university, and is ultimately my observations on the problems faced when dealing with Life Before, after and During University Education -<strong> and mostly explores the 'Hipster Culture'.</strong></p>
<p> the main character of the story (Blake), deals with identity, <strong>'fake' 'truth'</strong> the blur, and what it means to be Hipster and to be part of the<strong> Generation Y</strong> culture.</p>
<p>lastly, all these themes are wrapped up in a cute little romance and drama story with hopefuly a unique comic and drawing style!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Ok. so what am I contributing to here?</h3>
<p>So far, I have managed to fund printing for Chapters one and two on my own! Chapter three, however, is very big and long, and i won't have he money to print it myself -<strong> this is where you come in!</strong></p>
<p>Essentially this IndieGoGo project is a pre-order for Chapter three; <strong>so anyone who contributes the main amount of £10 gets the book (and a few extras!)</strong></p>
<p>The Book is <strong>a4 size</strong> (big) <strong>Full colour</strong> (colourful)<strong> and a whopping 84 pages</strong> :) this is also a test, and if this campaign goes well, I will use it in future to print more Blake Sinclair books =) </p>
<p><strong>The full amount I intend to raise pays for 100 copies of the book -</strong> wonderfuly, if the full amount doesn't get raised you all get <strong>refunded-</strong> so it's pretty much a win/win situation for everyone :D!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>That's it;</h3>
<p><em><strong>if you do support this project-</strong></em></p>
<p>- <strong>thank you for supporting girly, emotional, character driven comics</strong> (that are not the most popular thing in the world.)</p>
<p>i hope doing these and other future projects promotes to people the impact that COMICS can have on people.</p>
<p>thank you :) peace out!x</p>

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>My name is Mike.  I am an Indie Comics Creator creating comics/stories under the banner of Dork Arts Comics.  What started out as a small thing I did to pass down time evolved into something quite fulfilling for me and has grown in an endeavor that I can use to tell creative, fun and real stories about topics that are of interest to me. </p>
<p>This campaign marks the beginning of what I am calling ""Phase 2"" of my indie comics endeavor.  I had completed a comic prior to this which was done to see if I could complete a full comic on my own.  Well that was checked off the list and in this phase I am hoping to access an audience I have cultivated to get this 2nd book made and distributed for ocular consumption.  </p>

<p>I am looking to fund the manufacturing of a large number of factory made vinyl Trump Troll dolls. The sculpture seems to have struck a very popular chord with my family and friends on Facebook.</p>
<p> I want to make this figure widely available to everyone around the world that has taken a liking to my caricature sculpture and to do that I need your help to cover the costs of making the production molds and castings as well as the freight costs from the toy factory. </p>
<p>I will cast and finish the resins figures as soon as the goal is met and have them on the way to those at that support level. The vinyl figures will be turned around as soon as I can get the factory on board and fulfilling the orders. The art is ready to go and it's a matter of production of the pieces now. </p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help in making this happen!!!</p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>The first challenge is finding a quality factory to make these figures. <br/>Thankfully I have been in the collectible industry for decades and have made friends with all areas of production so it is a matter of narrowing down the companies that can produce these to our satisfaction and price point. <br/>This will take some time to get samples and make changes if necessary. Please know I will do this as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>I want to be sure everyone has their reward in a timely manner. <br/>I will send out a survey after the fundraising drive is over and ask for your mailing address. Then as soon as the figures are available for shipping I will have them on the way to you!</p>

<h3><strong>About the Creator:</strong></h3>
<p>Ken R Keller was born in 1994. He grew up loving comic books, Star Wars, Cartoons and some Anime. Some of his favorite inspirations were: X-Men, Batman, Avenger's, DBZ, Ninja Turtles, Watchmen &amp; more. Ken has always had a passion for writing; writing poems in elementary school, stories, and his own hand drawn comics for years of some of his favorites. </p>
<p>Red Talon was a dream created many years ago, around 2003-2005 . At first he was called Black Talon and he was actually created by Ken R Keller (III's) father, Ken K Keller (II). I am Ken R Keller and the writer, story-teller and co-creator of the Red Talon universe along with my father. We created our own studio Flat World Comics all the way back then but never made it a reality. </p>
<p>I then spent many of my teenage years trying to convert our comic book idea into a teen novel; in fact I wrote the novel twice. I would spend hours roleplaying online, writing fan fictions, working on the novel and honing my writing. In the end when I was 23 (2017) I decided that the story would be best seen as it was always intended: as a action packed comic book with an original story.</p>
<p>In 2018 my family and I self produced and published Red Talon 1 through Flat World Comics. The first issue was put in Emerald City Comic's in St Pete Florida; being the very first comic shop to host RT.  Red Talon issue 1 and quickly caught the eye of Publisher Star Cross Comics ran by Joe Spicer. Now the Red Talon's universe has collided with Star Cross for an even wider and more thrilling universe: think Christian Marvel or DC in the making. You can help us create this dream and make sure the Red Talon brand continues for many years to come!</p>
<p>Now Red Talon 2 had a successful launch on Kickstarter but we wanted to bring it over to Indie GoGo! We won't let COVID-19 stop us but thoughts and prayers to all affected. Ken Keller is also working on a expanded origins Red Talon novel &amp; another novel set in the Red Talon universe called the Raven Wolf these will be published through Flat World Comics but still tie in with Star Cross universe. </p>
<p><strong>Personal Life:</strong></p>
<p>At 26 now Ken Keller still plans to finish his degree in English writings. He works at a company called RGIS, manages and writes for Red Talon and other Star Cross stories and manages and created his own music label. He is an artist and his passion lays in his comics, music and art.</p>

<h3><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></h3>

Risks and challenges
We all know the risk of supporting a ""Facebook publisher"" Will you get your comic? Will it show up on time? Star Cross Comics publishes with confidence! They have been producing comics for 20 years. The also have a good track record of completing orders. You can be confident that you will receive your book and in a timely manner as the majority of production is complete and the files will be going to print before this campaign closes. This is also the 2nd book in a series that has been successfully funded 2 times prior. Star Cross Comics is also proud of its quality control measures. They have been very selective of the partners they keep due to quality control and branding. You will get a retail quality book packaged nicely to your door!

<h3> Summary</h3>
<p>Funding for a 100 page original graphic novel in hardcover . Black and white interior,  with color cover.</p>
<p>Hey guys, my name’s Adam Archer, I’ve been in comics since 2000. I started working in-studio then as a colorist for Wildstorm/DC Comics in La Jolla, CA. I left the studio in 2007 once I was able to line up enough freelance work and have been writing and drawing full time since then. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some of the series I’ve drawn include, Friday the 13th, Gotham Academy, Scribblenauts, Ninja Turtles, Spooks, Batman Beyond, and Ratchet and Clank. My Main employers over the years have been DC, Marvel, Warner Brothers, and Cepia Toys. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the last decade I’ve been trying to transition from drawing for other people, to writing and drawing for myself. This is my first indiegogo campaign, and hopefully a big step toward making that happen. </p>
<p>I have over twenty creator-owned illustrated novels on Amazon now, but this is the first graphic novel I’ve done for myself in 7 years. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If this gets funded, I’ll be able to finish the project in 6 weeks instead of 6 months (by cutting out most other freelancing) and for the first time in my life, have one of my books in a beautiful hardcover format.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the time of this post, 90% of the book is drawn, I have almost half of it inked, and I already started lettering. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>1. Slightly thicker cover stock.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. Instead of blank endsheets (the first and last pages in a hardcover book) I can have illustrations on them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>3. And possibly 4 color printing of the black ink line work (rather than standard Black only printing) which can give richer and deeper black tones. (Still a black and white book, just higher quality blacks.) </p>

<p>I’ve done thousands of pages so far in my career. My hope with this campaign, again, is to be able to prioritize this book, and have it hop into the world in a quality hardcover edition. </p>

Funding for a 100 page original graphic novel in hardcover . Black and white interior,  with color cover.
Hey guys, my name’s Adam Archer, I’ve been in comics since 2000. I started working in-studio then as a colorist for Wildstorm/DC Comics in La Jolla, CA. I left the studio in 2007 once I was able to line up enough freelance work and have been writing and drawing full time since then.

Over the last decade I’ve been trying to transition from drawing for other people, to writing and drawing for myself. This is my first indiegogo campaign, and hopefully a big step toward making that happen. 
I have over twenty creator-owned illustrated novels on Amazon now, but this is the first graphic novel I’ve done for myself in 7 years. 
 
If this gets funded, I’ll be able to finish the project in 6 weeks instead of 6 months (by cutting out most other freelancing) and for the first time in my life, have one of my books in a beautiful hardcover format.
 
At the time of this post, 90% of the book is drawn, I have almost half of it inked, and I already started lettering. 

 
First, some sample pages...
 

 
Clem sprang into my mind in June of this year, and it's been a joy getting the fellah out. 
 
 
 
What's Needed & What You Get
 
Transparency 
 
My cost of printing for a small print run is about $5000. Shipping the books to my door is just under $500.
 
Taking into account the cost of boxes ($450), other shipping needs, and the fees for a campaign, I’ve tried to keep the price as low as I could without losing money. 
 
Perks
 
With any luck, if the campaign brings in more than my base costs, I can upgrade a few things on the book itself. 
 
1. Slightly thicker cover stock.
 
2. Instead of blank endsheets (the first and last pages in a hardcover book) I can have illustrations on them. 
 
3. And possibly 4 color printing of the black ink line work (rather than standard Black only printing) which can give richer and deeper black tones. (Still a black and white book, just higher quality blacks.) 
 

The Impact
 
The future is buying art directly from the artist with as few middlemen in between as possible. 
 
This allows us to express our voices as they are, rather than have them filtered or changed by publishers (art by committee). 
 
It gives creators a better shot at make a living (doing what they love, rather than work for hire) with hopefully stronger wages, as none of the profits are wasted or eaten up by the companies. I’m excited to see if crowd funding will help me do this. 
 
 

Risks & Challenges
The only risks in this campaign are for me, (any unforeseen costs I accrue by the end), not the customer. 
 
This book will be done, regardless.

<h3>The Pitch</h3>
<p>I am Matthew Henry Ford.</p>
<p>I've been running Dustbunny Pictures for about 10 years now, as a hub for my art and animation. At college, I studied Animation, and during that time I took a greater interest in the art of visual storytelling, and found my scripts and storyboards taking on a much more specific form: Comics.</p>
<p>I've developed and written 5, (that's right FIVE) unique storylines, roughed and revised them a few times over, honing them into epic fables as I went along, and offered them up as free-to-read titles online:</p>
<p><em>Hoodrat, </em></p>
<p><em><img alt=""Hoodrat Icon"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.dustbunnypictures.com/temp/HR.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p>
<p><em>Captain Kelly, </em></p>
<p><em><img alt=""Captain Kelly Icon"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.dustbunnypictures.com/temp/CK.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p>
<p><em>Maggie Matilla,</em></p>
<p><em><img alt=""Maggie Matilla Icon"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.dustbunnypictures.com/temp/MM.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p>
<p><em>Popoki's Island, </em></p>
<p><img alt=""Popoki's Island Icon"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.dustbunnypictures.com/temp/PI.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>and<em> Chronicles of the IGP</em>. </p>
<p><img alt=""IGP Icon"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.dustbunnypictures.com/temp/MD.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I want to tell these stories, if nothing else, and have a chance to share them with others. And I'm moving into a new phase in their production.  All 5 are getting a ""reboot"", and a devoted domain/website, with new pages added on a weekly rotation schedule.</p>
<p>Maggie is the most current.  IGP &amp; Kelly will be getting an updated revision in art style, and current script additions to match, and Hoodrat &amp; Popoki will finally get a full start into the series, not just scripts/concepts only.</p>
<h3><strong>The Costs</strong></h3>
<p>The short of it is, that in order to step up production, I need a new tablet, a Wacom Cintiq (about $1000-2000), and a few hundred extra for website costs, modification and development, (and to cover the indiegogo fees).</p>
<p>The Rewards are Art. Unique, one-of-a-kind, all your own, pieces of your own choosing, either the original, or a high quality color glossy print (framed if you so choose) with the drawing, or digital file (psd), or all three, however you choose, it's yours and yours alone, whatever you wish, I eandeavor to put down onto paper for you.</p>
<p>This is much the same way I would usually charge for commissioned work, but stepping up the timetable and putting it a ""safer"" public forum, like crowdfunding with terms offered.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to reach the goal, but if not it still puts me in a slightly better position to start the ""reboot"", albeit, at a much slower rate getting the pages online. A page a week from each series, on a rotation.  </p>
<p>If I reach the goal, that figure could double or triple, maybe put me on the path to publication or even print, or animated shorts.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A bit more detailed blurb on each series is available in the gallery. With some art, etc. But to really, finally get invested in these stories, writing them all the way to their conclusions, would be an immensely satisfying goal, for both me and the reader.</p>
<p>As a show of good faith, if you're interested, you can also see/read a few of the prototype/working models of the comic series on my site.</p>

<p>The Art Piece Requests donators recieve will be done in order of donations/requests recieved, and I will try my best to keep you up to date and keep you well informed, as to your piece's completion.</p>

<p>Phoenix Comics and Games is going to be the premier comic book store in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.  As both a life-long comic book geek and gamer, my goal is to create a space that you, faithful readers, card floppers, dice chuckers and board gamers can come to enjoy.  I want someplace where it's okay to drop by, grab a book off the shelf and sit down and peruse it without fear of being glared at.</p>
<p>To that end, we're putting in a conference table for daytime gaming and reading, mobile displays that let us change from primarily a selling venue during the day to a gaming venue at night!  We've got a great design for some custom acrylics that really make the comics and graphic novels pop off the shelves.  To finish it out, we also want to recruit some local artistic talent to doodle on the walls.  And of course, we want this to be your personalized Comic Store.</p>
<p>But to do all that we need your help!</p>
<p><strong>Personalized?  What do you mean by that?</strong></p>
<p>It's pretty simple really - we want to know what you want us to carry.  By donating as little as $10, you get a chance to make your thoughts known.  Should we carry War Machine?  Warhammer 40K?  Tell us that!  </p>
<p>Every perk at all levels of funding comes with a vote on a survey after the funding period has ended.  The more votes something gets, the more of a slice of the pie that it will occupy in my initial inventory purchase.  But just to give you all a brief listing of what I already know I'm going to carry:</p>

<li>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</li>
<li>Pathfinder</li>
<li>Role Playing Games</li>
<li>Reaper Miniatures</li>
<li>Board Games</li>
</ul><p>So, if you don't see something on the list, here's your chance to add it in!  Or heck, see something on there that isn't very specific?  Help me flesh out the idea!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately what we need is money for the fixtures, the table, and the artists to decorate the space we're going to secure.  Once we've got those, we need to start in on the initial inventory.  The more money up front we have for that, the less we have to shmooze with banks.   Which is no fun at all, trust me.</p>
<p>So, that said, I do want to give back to the community, especially if we exceed the goal I have set up for the campaign.  In the event that we exceed the goal, the money raised will go to providing additional perks (see below) for all backers.  In the jaw-dropping event that we drastically exceed all of the stretch goals set forth, well...I'll have to get creative and think of new ways to reward all of you wonderful people out there!  </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i>What exactly is this Fallout project?:</i></h2>
<strong>The TLDR is that it’s a comic.</strong><p>Right now I am working on Book 1, which is a painfully faithful adaptation of the Fallout 1 game. For those who have only played the later games, Fallout 1 is a much darker story. It’s more violent, sexual, and just all around more gritty and mature.</p>
<p>Book 1 consists of 6 chapters. Each chapter is about 4 parts long and each part is comprised of about 16 pages. Give or take a few dozen, the completed main story is going to be about 380 pages long.</p>
<p>Additionally, each part will have cover art, and each chapter will also have a self contained side story. The side story will feature the main characters, but not really follow the main story as they are based on side quests and random encounters. These side stories will vary greatly in lengths anywhere from 1 to about 10 pages long. (note, these will be more clearly defined later as right now I have been focusing mainly on the main story structure)</p>
<p>So all together the first book will be roughly 400+ pages long, and will take a while! About 2 years if I’m able to keep it going. If I can gather enough support and complete book 1, then I’ll start working on Book 2 which will be an adaptation of Fallout 2. And I’ll just keep going as long as I can get support. I NEED to make Book 2, but the more I think of it, Book 3 and New Vegas would be awesome too!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who is working on it and why? </strong></p>
<p>Right now it’s just me and I have hired a talented artist to draw for me, but, depending on how much support I can gather, I plan on hiring many more.</p>
<p>I am writing the comic, and creating layouts, doing clean up, lettering and color. I give my mocks to Dee and he gives me back some line work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Here’s my plan.</strong></p>
<p>Dee will be the main story line artist.</p>
<p>But for the side quests I plan to commission other, lesser known, but extremely talented artists.</p>
<p>And the covers will be a mix, sometimes me, sometimes Dee, sometimes other artists.</p>
<p>Dee will have first dibs on the main quest, but if he ever doesn’t want to do it anymore I’ll just pick up a new artist and keep moving forward. Although I hope he stays a while. It’s going to be so awesome watching him grow!</p>
<p>This is the best part of this project IMO. I know so many extremely talented, underrated artists. I really do love these peoples work, and would love to shine a spotlight on it. A collective of all these really original art styles. Anyway, back to the details.</p>
<h3>Where will the money be going?</h3>
<p>The bulk of the money will be going towards reward fulfillment. The rest of the money will go to funding part 2.</p>
<p>Funding goal is $5000</p>
<ul>
<li>$2300 Cost to print 1000 copies of the comic</li>
<li>$2000 Production costs for part 2</li>
<li>$700 Rewards, packaging, and adjusted shipping</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the bare bones cost to get everything printed and shipped out.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>There are plenty of challenges that go along with a project like this; creating a comic book isn't simple and a lot goes into them.<p>The first and biggest challenge is simply producing the pages (if only in digital form). I have to adapt the script, design the mock ups and page layout, coordinate with my artist/s, get the pages draw and sent to me, cleaned up, lettered, colored... it's a long process, HOWEVER, this is why I didn't ask for funding for part one, to help insure I was able to provide pages (on a set scheduled) and keep the promises I make.</p>
<p>With the exception of only one delay (it was two days late) I have kept my promise and uploaded on scheduled for the past 3 months :) and I have only refined my process and things run more smoothly everyday.</p>
<p>Of course there is a whole other set of challenges that go along with producing the physical copies for rewards and shipping them, but I have been creating and shipping products for years now through my online store, so very familiar with the process and don't expect to be blindsided from an unforeseen detail, and am confident I will be able to resolve it if I am.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><p>The best way you can help without being a contributor is by being a fan, reading the comic (online for free) and just sharing and talking about it. Sharing and talking about something you love helps out way more than you realize sometimes.</p></div>","!!!DISCLAIMER!!!! This project is unofficial and is in NO way affiliated with the official Fallout franchise or Bethesda. It is a completely unauthorized fan comic. The official Fallout franchise and it's owners in no way endorses, is responsible for, or affiliated in anyway to this project.
 
TLDR: Campaigning to gather funds to produce part 2 of my Fallout comic (based on fallout 1), will be creating and shipping physical copies of part one as a reward.
 
The FALLOUT Survival Guide is an unofficial, free to read comic online that faithfully retraces the steps of the first Fallout video game. This is a fan comic, however, it is not a fan fiction. I have poured through the lore and have desperately tried to piece the canonical events to the best of my ability. I hope to be so accurate that this book could double as a strategy guide.
 
STRETCH GOALS!
$10,000 -  A wasteland mini map will be added to every order.
(I'll update more stretch goals soon)
 
The comic will have a vintage / beat up vibe to it, complete with bends and stains.
I have all 16 pages for issue one done already, however I do plan on going back and reworking the colors before publishing, I've experimented along the way and want to just go back and hone the style a little more.

We want to make sure that our readers are getting the best, most varied and most entertaining graphic tales every issue. </p>
<p>And the way we'll do it is simple. As well as running comics as monthly series we will also publish longer, one-off stories on a regular basis and through a voting platform, built into the NCS app, the readers can let us know what they like and what they want more of.</p>

<p>Whoever you are, New Comic Star is for you.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What does your contribution do?</h3>
<p>Basically, every dollar from the Indiegogo funding drive goes towards not just getting the first issue out, but laying a framework for New Comic Star's continued publication and success. This is not just a campaign to pump out a single issue of a comic, this is the foundation of a publisher that will digitally distribute comics from authors both new and old into the forseeable future.</p>
<p>For the organisation, the money you contribute goes to meeting with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contract lawyers</li>
<li>Accountants</li>
<li>Taxation specialists</li>
</ul>
<div>That ensure that New Comic Star can protect the rights of their published writers and artists and get them paid on time, every time. It also pays for up-front costs that pre-empt the first issue like:</div>

<ul>
<li>Website design and hosting</li>
<li>App creation</li>
<li>Advertising</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>For the readers, the money you contribute means:</div>

<p>If we hit our goal then it means that New Comic Star will launch as a well advertised, well supported comic periodical with a solid web back-end. It ensures that the contracts and payrolls that get our writers and artists paid properly and legitimately will be in order.</p>
<p>If we exceed our goal it means that New Comic Star can increase the budget for advertising and promotion, develop for Android and/or Kindle distribution and even produce a limited run of print editions beyond the special first prints that we have as rewards.

I'm The Elegant Cat, a young comic artist who just finished a personal challenge that I like to call ""100% comics"". During this challenge I had to do 100 comics in 100 days...for no real reason whatsoever. I did it for personal improvement and to prove myself that I am able to do such a thing. So, I chose an idea, a site, and I started posting my mini-series ""Dev &amp; the Fanbase"" on memecenter.com.  <br/>It's been a while since a finished the challenge (successfully) and I can't even say how many things I learned as an author and as a person... I learned on my skin that hard work really pays. So I decided to start an indiegogo campaign to collect all of the episodes...in USB keys! And now I really want to talk about this...because it's really not about my little comic series, but ut's about showing the industry and the authors another way to publish a comic. I thought that since we’re talking about web comics here, a paper
version would have been unfitting. I really hate when a web designed comics has
to change in the layout and the composition in order to be published. <br/>On the other hand i understand the need of the costumer to have a physical proof of his investment...that's why I chose USB keys for this because, they can be fancy and professional! They can also be packaged in nice alluminium boxes with the logo on top and stuff like that and that's what I'm trying to do here. <br/>If I reach my goal I'm planning to order a decent amount of these keys on flashbay.com<br/>and start spreading this new idea of publishing comics through authors and editors.<br/>The industry can be changed, people!  <br/><p></p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/472393/files/20140330230707-85.jpg?1396246027"" src="""" style=""width: 558.414px; height: 932px;""/></p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Now, let me just say that I do not plan to have more money than I need for this...and I want to be 100% honest because I really, really believe in this project and I want you to believe me...If I don't get the founds, fine. You will get your money back and in some cases (view perks) you will still get your product because I can afford to get 50 keys on my own...but I want this to be a thing. <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/472431/files/20140330234145-72.jpg?1396248105"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>250 USB keys + packages at flashbay.com = 1300 euros more or less, so, considering possible nonsenses from the site, fees to pay and margin of error, I will go safe and I will ask you guys 1500 euros to get this started.</p><p>For everyone of you that manages to offer 4.90 or more there's one of the packaged keys with the pdf file of the whole series and more (again, view perks).</p><p>I don't have much to offer aside my own art but I managed to procure myself a stock of 50 t-shirts with the logo of the series and there's one with your name on if you donate 24.90 euros! Other than that I can offer personal comics, previews of my upcoming experimental graphic novel ""Underground Cult"", wallpapers, custoized avatar pics and things like that. </p><p>Please ,notice that all of the delivery costs is on charge of the receiver.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/472430/files/20140330234100-logo.jpg?1396248060"" src="""" style=""width: 559.39px; height: 193px;""/><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3>As I said before, I'm not making this for my comic (well, not only) but to prove a point.<br/>I want to prove that web comics can be published in new and unique ways, ways that actually respect the original format of the work. <br/>If we can manage to make this a thing I strongly believe we can make this an example and an option for all the authors on the internet. USB keys are inexpensive, way cheaper than  a traditional print. Just imagine the things that such a thing could do for both the authors and the industry!<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/472518/files/20140331003916-71.jpg?1396251556"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/>I am asking you for 1500 euros but if I manage to have more I could finally afford my own website and maybe starting a production. I could spend more time experimenting on web comics and make more ""100% comics"" challenge. It would be a great thing for me to make this kind of things for a living...and now I'm flying high with my imagination .<br/>Let's keep it real for now. 1500 euros. 250 keys. Seems reasonable, isn't it?<br/><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>I really hope I get you excited at this point and if you can't help with money no problem. <br/>You can help me just following my work on my tumblr page at <a href=""http://www.tumblr.com/blog/thecatscomics"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.tumblr.com/blog/thecatscomics</a> or sharing my ""Dev &amp; the Fanbase"" episodes on Facebook or twitter. You can find the whole series here <a href=""http://www.memecenter.com/theelegantcat"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.memecenter.com/theelegantcat</a>.<br/>Naturally, remember to link this campaign to your friends on the internet.<br/></div>","Short SummaryHello there!

version would have been unfitting. I really hate when a web designed comics has
to change in the layout and the composition in order to be published. On the other hand i understand the need of the costumer to have a physical proof of his investment...that's why I chose USB keys for this because, they can be fancy and professional! They can also be packaged in nice alluminium boxes with the logo on top and stuff like that and that's what I'm trying to do here. If I reach my goal I'm planning to order a decent amount of these keys on flashbay.comand start spreading this new idea of publishing comics through authors and editors.The industry can be changed, people!  What We Need & What You GetNow, let me just say that I do not plan to have more money than I need for this...and I want to be 100% honest because I really, really believe in this project and I want you to believe me...If I don't get the founds, fine. You will get your money back and in some cases (view perks) you will still get your product because I can afford to get 50 keys on my own...but I want this to be a thing. 250 USB keys + packages at flashbay.com = 1300 euros more or less, so, considering possible nonsenses from the site, fees to pay and margin of error, I will go safe and I will ask you guys 1500 euros to get this started.For everyone of you that manages to offer 4.90 or more there's one of the packaged keys with the pdf file of the whole series and more (again, view perks).I don't have much to offer aside my own art but I managed to procure myself a stock of 50 t-shirts with the logo of the series and there's one with your name on if you donate 24.90 euros! Other than that I can offer personal comics, previews of my upcoming experimental graphic novel ""Underground Cult"", wallpapers, custoized avatar pics and things like that. Please ,notice that all of the delivery costs is on charge of the receiver.The ImpactAs I said before, I'm not making this for my comic (well, not only) but to prove a point.I want to prove that web comics can be published in new and unique ways, ways that actually respect the original format of the work. If we can manage to make this a thing I strongly believe we can make this an example and an option for all the authors on the internet. USB keys are inexpensive, way cheaper than  a traditional print. Just imagine the things that such a thing could do for both the authors and the industry!I am asking you for 1500 euros but if I manage to have more I could finally afford my own website and maybe starting a production. I could spend more time experimenting on web comics and make more ""100% comics"" challenge. It would be a great thing for me to make this kind of things for a living...and now I'm flying high with my imagination .Let's keep it real for now. 1500 euros. 250 keys. Seems reasonable, isn't it?Other Ways You Can HelpI really hope I get you excited at this point and if you can't help with money no problem. You can help me just following my work on my tumblr page at http://www.tumblr.com/blog/thecatscomics or sharing my ""Dev & the Fanbase"" episodes on Facebook or twitter.

<p>So – a bit more detail:</p>
<p>Paul Kerensa is a legend. A stand-up comic, a writer and a thoroughly decent human being. He’s not the kind of guy to rant, but I recently saw a photo on his Facebook page from hospital. He’d been struck with ‘Diverticulitis’ on the one week where he had a really busy week of work scheduled. He sadly had to cancel it and while now on the road to recovery, he’s still a bit screwed.</p>
<p>In his uncharacteristic ward rant, he said:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>“I'm in hospital. And I'm angry. Angry at myself. At my body for letting me down. The one week I have £3k+ worth of work, now had to cancel it to be here. This work week was meant to cover the typically quiet August, or help fund the dreaded Jan '18 tax bill. Instead I'm on a hospital ward. It always happens in lucrative weeks - never first week of January or any time in August. I'm going to quit this business of show. Get a job that pays sick leave. Fed up of working my backside off for free, for work to finally come in that I then have to cancel. Onstage I make light of my weird medical condition. Make it sound optimistic and positive and how we should all have been born with bladders on the outside, it would've been fun! But here I am and there goes the work and I hate my guts”</i></p>

<p>With Paul’s pockets suddenly empting, the irony is that this intestinal inflammation causes massive pain due to forming pockets full of crap.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>
<p>I am an artist who wen to school for computer graphics to make animated films and video games. As a side project using my traditional drawing skills I've created a graphic novel series about a historical figure turned super hero.</p>
<p>Supporting this campaign would help to promote this series and push it towards completion. It is a story I am very excited to illustrate and get into. The tale follows the life of the philosopher Nietzsche and uses his ideas to create a fantasy world of good versus evil. Other historical figures include his friends and family, such as the famous composer, turned arch nemesis, Richard Wagner. The struggles, soaring highs and abysmal lows Nietzsche went through for his work translate well to an epic graphic novel.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When finished, there will be 9 volumes in all. Each book would be roughly 30-50 pages and correspond to the books Nietzsche wrote at those times in his life. The first volume, The Birth of Tragedy covers his early life up until his first book of the same name, and the rest of his life is documented all the way up to his untimely death. The completed issue is called Twilight of the Idols Part 1 and it is somewhere in the middle of his journey showing what the Ubermensch series has to offer. </p>
<p><font>I am asking for $500 to get this series off the ground. Most of the money will go towards printing and sending out copies of </font>Twilight of the Idols Part 1. Hopefully this campaign will get Ubermensch exposure through this issue and any other merchandise I am offering. My main goal is generating interest and getting people as excited as I am about this comic.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The first issue, Twilight of the Idols Part 1, is complete. I have already figured out what I need to do for my series and the only thing left to do is make more! The broad strokes for the series have been made, but a lot of the writing needs to be completed. With enough support I hope to get other people involved to help me work on this project to make the process move faster. Another artist or even a writer would make things a lot easier. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The smallest contribution I'm asking for is $1. Other ways to help would be by sharing my comic and getting the word out. There are a few places to go to help promote Ubermensch including Indiegogo's share tools. Check out these other pages too!</p>

Casty svolge l'attività di sceneggiatore, disegnatore e illustratore per serie quali <strong>Lupo Alberto</strong>, <strong>Cattivik </strong>e <strong>Topolino</strong>.<br/>Su Topolino esordisce come sceneggiatore nel 2003. Il suo esordio come disegnatore avviene due anni più tardi, dapprima come copertinista (Topolino n. 2597) e poi con la storia natalizia ""Topolino e le macchine ribelli"" (Topolino n. 2613).<br/>Nel 2006 ha vinto il Premio Fumo di China come miglior sceneggiatore umoristico italiano, nel 2011 il premio Bottaro - I Mestieri del Fumetto e nel 2016 il Premio Anafi come miglior autore completo. Come egli stesso dichiara, e come è spesso facile evincere leggendo le sue storie, i suoi punti di riferimento sono due tra i più grandi maestri Disney: Romano Scarpa e Floyd Gottfredson.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">About the project</h2>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p>""Where on Earth?!"" is set in a post-apocalyptic earth, where our main character, Elliot, lives in a city built underground with no sight of nature, in order to protect their society from the outside world.<br/>500 years ago, humans used all natural resources to the point of making the planet Earth almost collapse entirely. There were earthquakes, Vulcano explosions, typhoons, almost every natural disaster that occurred during 3 years. During those 3 years, a few people from each country managed to survive and step by step, they started to build ""cities"" with no contact with the outside world - they thought that, because of all the catastrophes that happened, the air wasn't breathable anymore. </p>
<p>This event was denominated as ""The Mankind's Disgrace. All pre-existed civilizations were torn apart and new ones were born. The city where Elliot was born, Murkshore, never maintained contact with other surviving societies and, during 500 years, created all sorts of technology to replace the natural resources -  everything is fabricated by machinery, from water to food.</p>
<p>Elliot was born to a wealthy family, living with his mother and sister.<br/>One day, as he was returning from work, he was caught up in a crime he didn't commit. As a result, the government sent him to the outside world with the intent of punishing him. <br/>Being fond of the comfort of the home he has known for 24 years, Elliot now has to learn how to survive in a different place while trying to find his way home.<br/>During this journey, he ends up meeting other people living in peace with nature, especially a boy named Aydin. Upon this meeting, a connection between the two starts to unfold and Elliot is exposed to having to deal with his sexuality and learning about his feelings.</p>
<h3>The project</h3>
<p>This project started as an idea for a one page comic for a university assignment and since then I decided to keep developing the story and turn it into a webcomic.<br/>I've always liked to read comics since I was a child but when I found the world of webcomics and its specified platforms, I've been really interested in creating my own series. The accessibility of reading a comic just by scrolling on your phone is so appealing to me and the way the panels are displayed, in contrast with the traditional comic panel display, helps me keep focus while reading. I'm also someone who's always creating new characters in my head but not doing anything with them, no world to live in and no personality, so I grabbed this opportunity to insert my characters in a world entirely built by me.<br/> <br/>As a queer person myself, I like to touch LGBTQ+ themes on my artwork and ""Where on Earth?!"" is no different. Boy's Love, men loving men romance media, always interested me and helped me through my teenage years on figuring out about other sexualities and my own. With my background in mind, I wanted to create a story appealing to me, something that would make me happy to keep working on. </p>
<p><strong>This webcomic is made for young adults </strong>and up as it touches sensitive topics such as sexual encounters, murder, etc.</p>

I had my first contact with anime when I was really young, maybe 6 to 8 years old, when I would watch these famous anime series on TV, like Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball, but to me, at that time, they were just like any other cartoon, I didn't know there was a difference.

<h2>Welcome to Zine Comics and our comic, Forerunners!</h2>
<h3>About the comic</h3>
<p>Forerunners came from asking the question, what if super villains were to gain super powers before super heroes?  How would the world react?  Would it even survive?  In the first issue, a news reporter goes to cover a story about a science experiment on editing DNA.  During the experiment, the test subject gains unexpected abilities and begins eliminating any witness to her transformation.  It's up to our reporter to escape the massacre in order to warn everyone, but was her transformation just a fluke or a calculated test run?  Read and find out!     </p>
<h3>Hello from Zine Comics</h3>
<p>My name is Ezekiel Buchanan and I created Zine Comics to get back to the when comics were entertaining.  I've always been interested in telling stories, so I created this company to combine my passion for storytelling and my love for comics to bring you stories that you will enjoy!</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to Zine Comics and our comic, Forerunners!
About the comic
Forerunners came from asking the question, what if super villains were to gain super powers before super heroes?  How would the world react?  Would it even survive?  In the first issue, a news reporter goes to cover a story about a science experiment on editing DNA.  During the experiment, the test subject gains unexpected abilities and begins eliminating any witness to her transformation.  It's up to our reporter to escape the massacre in order to warn everyone, but was her transformation just a fluke or a calculated test run?  Read and find out!

<p><b>SYNOPSIS   <font color=""olive"">SINOPSIS</font></b></p>
<p>That morning, everything started to go wrong. First, the sun stopped its journey in the sky. After that, her mother and all the people in her neighborhood froze. <b>Maya</b> felt really lonely that strange spring morning. Luckily, she had <b>Mauricio</b>, the cat. For some unknown reason, she and <b>Mauricio</b> had escaped the paralysis that gripped everyone around her. To make matters worse, out of the clouds came a fearsome flying shadow, threatening them from the sky, and had no choice but to hide in the dark metropolis. Her mother had warned her against that abandoned town full of secrets. But that morning... <b>Maya</b> had no choice but to venture into the depths of the city, as far as the very heart of the city!</p>
<p><font color=""olive"">Aquella mañana, todo empezó a salir mal. Primero, el sol detuvo su 
recorrido en el cielo. Después, su madre y toda la gente de su barrio se
 quedaron petrificados. <b>Maya</b> se sintió muy sola aquella extraña mañana 
de primavera. Menos mal que estaba <b>Mauricio</b>, el gato. Por alguna razón 
desconocida, <b>Mauricio</b> y ella habían escapado a la parálisis que 
atenazaba a todo el mundo a su alrededor. Para colmo de males, de entre 
las nubes surgió una temible sombra voladora, amenazándoles desde el 
cielo, y no tuvieron más remedio que esconderse en la metrópolis oscura.
 Su madre le había prevenido contra aquella ciudad abandonada y llena de
 secretos. Pero esa mañana… <b>Maya</b> se adentró hasta lo más profundo de la 
urbe, ¡hasta el mismo corazón de la ciudad!<br/></font></p>

<p><b>MOTIVATION   <font color=""olive"">MOTIVACIÓN</font></b></p>
<p>I have been working like an illustrator and comic book artist for years. I have worked for several major publishers in Spain: ""<b>Norma Comics</b>"", ""<b>Dude Comics</b>"" and ""<b>Toutain</b>"". I have ended up in self publishing because this way, I get absolute freedom to do my work the way I want. I have published an ebook version of “<b>Heart of Stone</b>” available for portable devices. But I think this story could be transferred to paper, as a stunning picture book, so that it can be <span style="""">enjoyed by many more readers who don't like reading in digital format.  However, as the traditional publishing world won't give this book a chance, I've decided to try a </span><b style="""">crowdfunding</b><span style=""""> campaign. I hope you, future reader, are as interested as I am, to see that this book becomes a reality, thanks to your support and cooperation, and it will be a pleasure to work so it can be in your hands soon.</span></p>
<p><font color=""olive"">He trabajado como dibujante de cómics e ilustrador durante años. 
Publiqué con “<b>Norma Cómics</b>”, “<b>Dude Cómics</b>” y “<b>Toutain Editor</b>”, pero he 
acabado editándome a mí mismo porque, de esta manera, tengo absoluta 
libertad para hacer las cosas a mi gusto. He publicado una versión ebook
 de “<b>Corazón de Piedra</b>”, disponible para dispositivos portátiles. Pero 
creo que esta historia puede ser transferida al papel, convertida en un 
estupendo libro ilustrado. De esta manera, podría ser disfrutado por 
muchos lectores que prefieren el papel al formato digital. Sin embargo, 
como las editoriales tradicionales no están dispuestas a darle una 
oportunidad a este libro, he decidido intentarlo a través de una campaña
 de <b>crowdfunding</b>. Espero que tú, futuro lector, estés tan interesado 
como yo en hacer que este proyecto llegue a ser una realidad, gracias a 
tu ayuda y colaboración, y será un placer trabajar para que el libro 
pueda estar pronto en tus manos.<br/></font></p>

<p><b>AN EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY   <font color=""olive"">UN VIAJE EXTRAORDINARIO</font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>""<b>Heart of Stone</b>"" is a fairy tale, whose greatest inspiration is ""<b>Alice in Wonderland</b>"" by <i>Lewis Carroll</i>. The protagonist is <b>Maya</b>, a girl who, due to a series of extraordinary events, is forced to go through a strange city full of fascinating characters. <b>Maya</b> will have to find the heart of the city, a forgotten entity that governs the metropolis, to save her mother and neighbors of a strange disease that have petrified them.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Mauricio</b>, Maya’s cat, helps her in her journey, while suffering an amazing transformation as they travel through the streets of this fantastic world. He will be the support the girl needs in the most difficult moments of her adventure. Their lives will change at the end of this initiatory journey.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In their quest, they will receive help from city residents, who live in a world dominated by the laws of <b>dream</b> and <b>imagination</b>: Little cowboys traveling mounted on slippers over wheels, monkey stewards subjected under the thumb of a tyrant, architects trapped on the walls of their own buildings, heroes devoured by their own success, musicians with the power to transform matter around ...</p>
<p>The reader will undertake their own journey through this world, lost between fantasy and reality.</p>

ve obligada a adentrarse en una extraña ciudad llena de personajes 
fascinantes. <b>Maya</b> tendrá que encontrar el Corazón de la Ciudad, una 
entidad olvidada que gobierna la metrópolis, para salvar a su madre y a 
sus vecinos de una extraña enfermedad que los ha petrificado.</font></p>
<p><font color=""olive""><b>Mauricio</b>,
 el gato de Maya, le ayuda en su viaje, mientras sufre una curiosa

<p><font color=""olive"">En su búsqueda,
 recibirán ayuda de los habitantes de la ciudad, que viven en un mundo 
dominado por las leyes del <b>sueño</b> y la <b>imaginación</b>: Pequeños cowboys que 
viajan montados en zapatillas rodantes, monos mayordomos sometidos bajo 
el pulgar de un tirano, arquitectos atrapados en los muros de sus 
propios edificios, héroes devorados por su propio éxito, músicos con el 
poder de transformar la materia a su alrededor…</font></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>My goal is to produce an <b>English</b> and <b>Spanish</b> printed edition of the “<b>Heart of Stone</b>” ebook. The book will be printed in high quality. Hardcover with dust jacket. Coated  170 g paper. The artwork will be printed in 4/4 inks, quatricomy with glossy varnish for the best result. Because of this, the price of printing for 600 copies reached <b>7500</b> euros. The cost of shipping to Europe and the rest of the world, has been estimated at <b>5800</b> euros. Thus, this budget is made to cover all the print costs, postage and Indiegogo fees. The budget also covers the costs of <i>paypal </i>and the necessary taxes. To thank you for your support I have a nice set of <b>rewards</b>.</p>
<p>First of all, the central <b>reward</b> of this campaign is the printed book. I'd love to see it all over the world and I've tried to make things as simple as possible. Therefore I have incorporated a <b>flat shipping fee</b> into the price of the book. That way, no matter where you are in the world, you don't have to worry about additional shipping costs. </p>
<p>I tried to make the price of the book as tight as possible. As you can see, it is even <b>cheaper</b> than the ones with similar characteristics that you would find in bookshops. With the added extras I have included exclusively for this edition, plus the convenience of receiving it at your home.</p>
<p></p>
<p><font color=""olive"">Mi objetivo es producir una edición impresa de “<b>Corazón de Piedra</b>” en

 quatricomía, 4/4 tintas con una capa de barniz para un resultado 
óptimo. Debido a esto, el precio de la edición de 600 copias del libro 
alcanzará los <b>7500</b> euros. Los gastos de envío a Europa y al resto del 
mundo rondarán los <b>5800</b> euros. Así pues, el presupuesto se ha 
establecido para cubrir los gastos de impresión, los envíos y los gastos
 de Indiegogo. También cubrirá los costes de Paypal y de los impuestos 
necesarios. Para agradecerte por tu apoyo, he preparado un buen número 
de <b>recompensas</b>.</font></p>
<p><font color=""olive"">Primero, la <b>recompensa</b> principal de esta campaña 
es el libro impreso. Me gustaría verlo llegar a todas partes del mundo y
 he intentado que sea lo más sencillo posible. Así que he incorporado 
una <b>tarifa plana de envío</b> dentro del precio del libro. De esta manera, 
no importa dónde en que lugar del mundo te encuentres, no tendrás que 
preocuparte de gastos de envío adicionales.</font></p>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><p><font color=""olive"">He
 intentado que el precio del libro sea lo más ajustado posible. Como 
puedes ver, el precio es incluso más <b>barato</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> de lo que se puede encontrar en librerías para un libro de estas características.  Con el añadido de

SYNOPSIS   SINOPSIS
That morning, everything started to go wrong. First, the sun stopped its journey in the sky. After that, her mother and all the people in her neighborhood froze. Maya felt really lonely that strange spring morning. Luckily, she had Mauricio, the cat. For some unknown reason, she and Mauricio had escaped the paralysis that gripped everyone around her. To make matters worse, out of the clouds came a fearsome flying shadow, threatening them from the sky, and had no choice but to hide in the dark metropolis. Her mother had warned her against that abandoned town full of secrets. But that morning... Maya had no choice but to venture into the depths of the city, as far as the very heart of the city!
Aquella mañana, todo empezó a salir mal. Primero, el sol detuvo su 
recorrido en el cielo. Después, su madre y toda la gente de su barrio se
 quedaron petrificados. Maya se sintió muy sola aquella extraña mañana 
de primavera. Menos mal que estaba Mauricio, el gato. Por alguna razón 
desconocida, Mauricio y ella habían escapado a la parálisis que 
atenazaba a todo el mundo a su alrededor. Para colmo de males, de entre 
las nubes surgió una temible sombra voladora, amenazándoles desde el 
cielo, y no tuvieron más remedio que esconderse en la metrópolis oscura.
 Su madre le había prevenido contra aquella ciudad abandonada y llena de
 secretos. Pero esa mañana… Maya se adentró hasta lo más profundo de la 
urbe, ¡hasta el mismo corazón de la ciudad!



MOTIVATION   MOTIVACIÓN
I have been working like an illustrator and comic book artist for years. I have worked for several major publishers in Spain: ""Norma Comics"", ""Dude Comics"" and ""Toutain"". I have ended up in self publishing because this way, I get absolute freedom to do my work the way I want. I have published an ebook version of “Heart of Stone” available for portable devices. But I think this story could be transferred to paper, as a stunning picture book, so that it can be enjoyed by many more readers who don't like reading in digital format.  However, as the traditional publishing world won't give this book a chance, I've decided to try a crowdfunding campaign. I hope you, future reader, are as interested as I am, to see that this book becomes a reality, thanks to your support and cooperation, and it will be a pleasure to work so it can be in your hands soon.
He trabajado como dibujante de cómics e ilustrador durante años. 
Publiqué con “Norma Cómics”, “Dude Cómics” y “Toutain Editor”, pero he 
acabado editándome a mí mismo porque, de esta manera, tengo absoluta 
libertad para hacer las cosas a mi gusto. He publicado una versión ebook
 de “Corazón de Piedra”, disponible para dispositivos portátiles. Pero 
creo que esta historia puede ser transferida al papel, convertida en un 
estupendo libro ilustrado. De esta manera, podría ser disfrutado por 
muchos lectores que prefieren el papel al formato digital. Sin embargo, 
como las editoriales tradicionales no están dispuestas a darle una 
oportunidad a este libro, he decidido intentarlo a través de una campaña
 de crowdfunding. Espero que tú, futuro lector, estés tan interesado 
como yo en hacer que este proyecto llegue a ser una realidad, gracias a 
tu ayuda y colaboración, y será un placer trabajar para que el libro 
pueda estar pronto en tus manos.



AN EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY   UN VIAJE EXTRAORDINARIO

""Heart of Stone"" is a fairy tale, whose greatest inspiration is ""Alice in Wonderland"" by Lewis Carroll. The protagonist is Maya, a girl who, due to a series of extraordinary events, is forced to go through a strange city full of fascinating characters. Maya will have to find the heart of the city, a forgotten entity that governs the metropolis, to save her mother and neighbors of a strange disease that have petrified them.


Mauricio, Maya’s cat, helps her in her journey, while suffering an amazing transformation as they travel through the streets of this fantastic world. He will be the support the girl needs in the most difficult moments of her adventure. Their lives will change at the end of this initiatory journey.


In their quest, they will receive help from city residents, who live in a world dominated by the laws of dream and imagination: Little cowboys traveling mounted on slippers over wheels, monkey stewards subjected under the thumb of a tyrant, architects trapped on the walls of their own buildings, heroes devoured by their own success, musicians with the power to transform matter around ...
The reader will undertake their own journey through this world, lost between fantasy and reality.

“Corazón de Piedra” es un cuento cuya mayor inspiración es “Alicia en
 el País de las Maravillas”, de Lewis Carroll. La protagonista es Maya, 
una niña que, debido a una serie de acontecimientos extraordinarios, se 
ve obligada a adentrarse en una extraña ciudad llena de personajes 
fascinantes. Maya tendrá que encontrar el Corazón de la Ciudad, una 
entidad olvidada que gobierna la metrópolis, para salvar a su madre y a 
sus vecinos de una extraña enfermedad que los ha petrificado.
Mauricio,
 el gato de Maya, le ayuda en su viaje, mientras sufre una curiosa 
transformación durante su viaje por las calles de este mundo fantástico.
 Ayudará a la niña en los momentos más difíciles de su aventura. Sus 
vidas cambiarán al final de este viaje iniciático.
En su búsqueda,
 recibirán ayuda de los habitantes de la ciudad, que viven en un mundo 
dominado por las leyes del sueño y la imaginación: Pequeños cowboys que 
viajan montados en zapatillas rodantes, monos mayordomos sometidos bajo 
el pulgar de un tirano, arquitectos atrapados en los muros de sus 
propios edificios, héroes devorados por su propio éxito, músicos con el 
poder de transformar la materia a su alrededor…
El lector emprenderá su propio viaje a través de este mundo, perdido entre la realidad y la fantasía.

MY GOAL   MI OBJETIVO


My goal is to produce an English and Spanish printed edition of the “Heart of Stone” ebook. The book will be printed in high quality. Hardcover with dust jacket. Coated  170 g paper. The artwork will be printed in 4/4 inks, quatricomy with glossy varnish for the best result. Because of this, the price of printing for 600 copies reached 7500 euros. The cost of shipping to Europe and the rest of the world, has been estimated at 5800 euros. Thus, this budget is made to cover all the print costs, postage and Indiegogo fees. The budget also covers the costs of paypal and the necessary taxes. To thank you for your support I have a nice set of rewards.
First of all, the central reward of this campaign is the printed book. I'd love to see it all over the world and I've tried to make things as simple as possible. Therefore I have incorporated a flat shipping fee into the price of the book. That way, no matter where you are in the world, you don't have to worry about additional shipping costs. 
I tried to make the price of the book as tight as possible. As you can see, it is even cheaper than the ones with similar characteristics that you would find in bookshops. With the added extras I have included exclusively for this edition, plus the convenience of receiving it at your home.

Mi objetivo es producir una edición impresa de “Corazón de Piedra” en
 inglés y español. El libro se imprimirá en alta calidad. Tapa dura con 
sobrecubierta. Papel cuché de 170 gr. Las ilustraciones se imprimirán en
 quatricomía, 4/4 tintas con una capa de barniz para un resultado 
óptimo. Debido a esto, el precio de la edición de 600 copias del libro 
alcanzará los 7500 euros. Los gastos de envío a Europa y al resto del 
mundo rondarán los 5800 euros. Así pues, el presupuesto se ha 
establecido para cubrir los gastos de impresión, los envíos y los gastos
 de Indiegogo. También cubrirá los costes de Paypal y de los impuestos 
necesarios. Para agradecerte por tu apoyo, he preparado un buen número 
de recompensas.
Primero, la recompensa principal de esta campaña 
es el libro impreso. Me gustaría verlo llegar a todas partes del mundo y
 he intentado que sea lo más sencillo posible. Así que he incorporado 
una tarifa plana de envío dentro del precio del libro. De esta manera, 
no importa dónde en que lugar del mundo te encuentres, no tendrás que 
preocuparte de gastos de envío adicionales.
He
 intentado que el precio del libro sea lo más ajustado posible. Como 
puedes ver, el precio es incluso más barato de lo que se puede encontrar en librerías para un libro de estas características.  Con el añadido de
 los extras y la comodidad de recibirlo en tu casa.

REWARDS  RECOMPENSAS


The book is 19 x 27 cm, hardcover with dust jacket, 108 pages, and contains the whole “Heart of Stone” story with more than 30 illustrations inside.

</div></div>","GORILLA MY DREAM #2: GORILLA TAILS (Limited Edition Cover)
 

GORILLA MY DREAMS is a black and white webcomic set in Struggle-Town, where the streets are protected by KNOCKAROUND-GUY, a talking gorilla who fancies himself a superhero. GORILLA MY DREAMS is best described as: BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES mashed with TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES if Saturday morning cartoons came on TV after 10pm. 
GORILLA MY DREAMS #1: MIME OF MY LIFE (36 pages Black & White); When a street mime is found dead (asphyxiated inside an actual invisible box), KNOCKAROUND-GUY soon finds himself wading through the ugly and dangerous underbelly of Struggle-Town.
After meeting MARGOT LE DIEU, the beautiful, grieving fiancé of the deceased, KNOCKAROUND-GUY’s investigations lead from The North Poles Strip Club, through a slew of colourful criminals, and finally point to crime kingpin LUCIFER BIM-BOM and his Killer Klown Syndicate.
GORILLA MY DREAMS #2: GORILLA TAILS (36 pages Black & White) explores Struggle-Town and its residents, spotlighting not only KNOCKAROUND-GUY but some of the other characters who cross paths with him; The cops, the crooks, even wannabe superheroes. 
In six short stories you'll... Gasp in terror as OFFICERS RUMPF & STUDWELL find themselves in a shoot-out with themed henchmen! Shriek in horror as STITCHIMONSTA tries to rescue a damsel in distress from a horde of zombies! Shudder in disgust at POINTY MCSPIKEFACE and MOTHERDUCKER's lives of crime!
AND SO MUCH MORE!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>There is this Dude, who thinks he can draw <a href=""http://birdsonwire.eu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">comic strips</a>. We are not quite sure about that, but it so happens we are his main characters, so we have to be supportive. He usually produces one strip a week, and they are mostly filled with a kind of subtle humour we appreciate. </p>
<p>It is not a popular strip (yet). But we would really like to get the word out and give it some promotion. We have this cool t-shirt design we made ourselves (promise) and we'd really like to put it to print. Problem is, t-shirts don't come cheap and the printer does not take IOUs from fictional characters... So pretty pretty please, help us!</p>
<p>Yours truly,<br/>Pete, Fatso and That Third One.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We talked to a local printer and he said he would give us a better price if we buy bulk. By his definition, bulk is at least 100 pieces. This way the t-shirt will be way cheaper than if we went the more traditional route of printing them on demand. But in this case we need somewhere close to $1000 on hand to bankroll the operation. That is where you come in.</p>
<p>True to the tradition, we have PERKS! Well, one real perk, actually. If you pledge at least $20, you get the t-shirt, fair and square. Sizes <span>XS,S,M,L,XL, XXL in regular or ladies cut are available.</span> This covers the t-shirt itself, shipping, and a tip to Dude for all his legwork.</p>
<p>If you pledge less, you still get something, too. You know that feeling, when you do something good and kind? Check. We will also list you as a donor in our website and Dude will draw an adorable 'thank you' picture for all of you.</p>
<p>If we print more t-shirts with the money we raise, than there are perks to deliver, the remainder will be sold on the website for a reasonable price. We are sure Dude will put the revenue to good use. (Coffee he drinks while drawing new episodes IS good use, isn't it?)</p>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The whole purpose of this project is to get the t-shirt printed. So if you like the design, just hop in.</p>
<p>If we get funded, it will take us up to 14 days to get the money, a few more to get the t-shirt printed, packaged and sent. </p>
<p>This is a fixed funding project, so if we don't reach our goal, you will be refunded as per Indiegogo rules. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The t-shirt was meant as a way to promote <a href=""http://birdsonwire.eu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">#birdsonwire</a> comic strip. If you like it, any way to get more people to read it is more than welcome - link to it, like it on Facebook, +1 it, tweet about it, talk abouti it to your friends... We thank you in advance ;)</p>

Our Story
Enter The Hero is a 135 page full color graphic novel written by me, Michael Heitkemper, and featuring amazing artwork by artist Simon Butler.  Enter The Hero does have a publisher attached to it; however the interior artwork obviously needs to be completed before going into the printing stages. 


 
This is a story that I hold very dear to my heart.  In the same fashion as George Lucas with Star Wars, I originally wrote ETH as something much bigger.  But in order to pitch the project to publishers, I had to condense it down into one singular story about a super hero that suddenly appeared from no where.  Rest assured, we have plans that exceed this release.  
 
The secrets of the Hero and his powers were a challenging thing to conjure up.  I wanted him to live inside a realistic setting, so he had to have a realistic origin.  Also, since no one, not even the reader knows who the Hero is the story had to be told from several other character’s points of view.  This makes for some interesting dialogue and character confrontations.    
 
If you’re into classic super hero tales with fresh and interesting characters, I know that Enter The Hero will be right up your alley.


 
Synopsis
Thomas Brandt is your run of the mill geekoid robotic engineer.  He’s down on his luck, and has just botched a huge contact that could have saved his career.  Just as Thomas is about to stoop to flipping burgers to foot the bills, he’s offered the opportunity of a lifetime:  Create a robotic weapon that is capable of detaining the vigilante known only as the Hero.  Thomas begins his work, but it soon becomes evident that the Hero has other plans; tear down the corporate curtain which is hiding the cities true threat.


 
The Impact
Enter The Hero has the potential of being something epic.  It re-introduces us to the enjoyable capabilities of a super hero story without all of the huge character life-altering crossovers that we’re forced to choke down each month.  We have BIG plans for Enter The Hero after it is completed.  Not only do we have plans for future installments, but we would also love to bring Enter The Hero to life as a new animated series and who knows maybe even a movie :) 



What We Need & What You Get
We’re looking to raise $3,500 to cover the cost of completing the remaining interior artwork. Enter The Hero is already more than halfway completed with funding from my own pocket and from private investors; the money we raise here will pay to finish the remainder. 
It costs $90 for each drawn, inked, colored and lettered page.  Try to find an equal or better quality artist at that rate, I dare you.  There are 39 pages of art yet to be completed in this 135 page graphic novel.  We’re almost there!  
Any money raised over our goal will be saved to help fund the second installment of Enter The Hero and possible animated series. 
In return for your generous donations we have all kinds of Enter The Hero swag to send your way.  This includes, but is not limited to special edition art cards, t-shirts, downloads, and of course copies of Enter The Hero.  Which means that by backing this project, you will read and experience Enter The Hero before anyone else.  Check out the perks to the right.  We have something for everyone!

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can’t offer any financial help, please at least consider helping spread the word about our project.  Tweet about us, share our project on facebook or on any other social site you may be involved with.  We really appreciate every peek of interest that we receive.  Go ahead, hit those share buttons!  Spread the word!  ENTER THE HERO!!!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Qui est Pythéas ?</h3>
<p>Pythéas  est un explorateur grec originaire de
Massalia, l'antique Marseille. Il est l'un des plus anciens explorateurs
scientifiques ayant laissé une trace dans l'histoire, il a effectué vers
340-325 avant J.-C. un voyage dans les mers du nord de l'Europe.   </p>
<p>Le
choix de Pythéas comme support à cette histoire nous a semblé naturel. Choisir
cet explorateur phocéen est un clin d’œil à une partie de l’histoire de France.
Personnage décrié en son temps pour ses découvertes extraordinaires,  il permet d’inscrire le récit dans une
démarche historique crédible. Véritable aventurier des temps antiques, il crée
une synthèse entre le monde grec et le monde nordique, offrant aux passionnés
de ces deux univers une aventure unique.</p>
<h3>Scénario</h3>
<p>Une brume épaisse enrobe la flèche d’Artémis. Les 50 rameurs
ont levé la cadence et la galère grecque progresse désormais difficilement au
milieu des gigantesques blocs de glace qu’avait décrit Pythéas, le père
d’Atlas, dans ses récits de voyage. A ses cotés se trouve le vieux compagnon de
son père, Sirius, le capitaine de la première expédition vers le nord. Ce
dernier désabusé par cette brume encourage Atlas à accepter de faire demi-tour.
Un silence de plomb frappe les hommes stupéfaits par un paysage incroyable
sorti des brumes, une montagne de glace leur fait soudainement face. Les
rameurs redoublent d’efforts dans le but de freiner le navire et éviter la
collision. Il est trop tard pour faire demi-tour, la mer déchaînée les pousse
inexorablement vers ce mur de glace…. </p>

<p></p><h2>Project </h2>
<p>You
love epic tales ? Lost civilisations ? Ancient worlds ? The
Greeks, the Celts or the Nordics ? Science fiction, history or
mythology ? <br/>
So, get ready to follow Atlas on his quest around the world.
Fight powerfull ennemies alongside Celts mercenaries. Revisit the history of
the world and unveil the mysteries of Thule, its volcanos, ices and
inhabitants.</p>
<p>Atlas
is a fantasy Odyssey taking place in the ancient world, around 300 BC. Our
hero is the son of the famous Greek explorer Pytheas, who discovered a
mysterious ice-covered island while sailing to the north looking for tin. This
island, that he named Thule, has been the source of many fantasies through the history
and is inspiring our script.</p><p>
It all
starts with the failure of the killers sent by the Persian Emperor to steal
Pytheas's travel notes. In the aftermath of the attack, Pytheas mortally
wounded, handed over this mysterious book to his son. Driven by a blind desire of
vengeance Atlas follows his father’s footsteps to the northern lands.</p><ul>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>The whole ATLAS story is split into several albums, and this
first funding round is aimed at financing the very first one. It will set the
ground for Atlas adventures by defining the context and some core protagonists.
The next albums will be structured in a way that will allow independant
reading. Depending on Atlas’ readers community size and interest, some
adventures may then take place over several albums, as it happens for comics
such as Thorgal. <br/></p>

<h3>Who is Pytheas ?</h3>
<p>Pytheas
is a Greek explorer from Massalia, the modern day Marseille in Southern France,
founded by greek colonists originally from Phocea, a city in the ancient Ionian
Greece. He is one of the very first explorers sailing for scientific
purposes, who left a mark on History. He sailed across the North Sea around
340-325 BC and described for the first time some polar phenomena, the tides and
the living standards of populations living in Britain as well as Germany,
along the North Sea. He may even have sailed to the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>He
was considered a liar by contemporary geographers and scholars who could not
admit the existence of a frozen seawater. His travel notes and especially his
astronomic observations had remained disregarded for a long time.</p>
<p>The
choice of Pytheas’ life as a background for Altas story appeared obvious to us
as he is a testimony of the exchanges that happened in the ancient Europe
between north and south, involving Greece, France, northern and central Europe.
This is a unique adventure for people passionate about Nordics and Greeks
worlds. Finally, he was for sure a controversial person at his times who turned
out to be right ! Atlas story will be backed up with strong historical
research.</p>
<h3>Script</h3>
<p>A thick fog hides Artemis’ arrow. The fifty rowers have
slowed down as the greek galley is now crossing the enormous ice rocks
described by Atlas’ father, Pytheas, in his travel notes. Sirius, Pytheas most
loyal companion, is standing next to Atlas. He was part of the first trip to the
Northern lands and is now so tired of this ice sea that he tries hard to
convince Atlas to give up and command to turn back to Massalia. This
discussion outstands in the worrying silence of the crew, now speechless as a
giant iceberg progressively appears from the fog. It is too late to
turn back : the boat is about to smash on the iceberg despite rowers
efforts.</p>

<h3>Theudbalder – graphist, colorist and scriptwriter</h3>
<p>Independent graphist graduated in graphic arts, with
experiences as concept artist, 3D graphist, illustrator in the video game
industry as well as plastic figurines and card games designer.</p>
<p>He is working simultaneously on several independent scify
comics books, including « Atlas », his main project as author and
graphic illustrator.</p>
<h3>Celtine – Inking, graphist &amp; scriptwriter</h3>
<p>Originally a designer, she moved toward graphic arts and
illustration. She is particularly interested in the relationship between nature
and mankind. She joined the project and brought not only her expertise but also
a feminine view to the script.</p>
<p>Atlas adventures will leverage some mysteries that the most
advanced sciences have not been able to explain so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perfect iron
spheres discovered in South Africa, dated to 3 billion years.</li>
<li>Nanotech
developed 2000 years ago and recently discovered in Oural mountains</li>
<li>Chinese
alluminium bronze, alloy forgotten for 1500 years</li>
<li>Light bulbs
painted on 4200-year-old Egyptian low reliefs</li>
<li>Electric
batteries unveiled close to Bagdad, dated to 2500 BC</li>
<li>Unexplained
off-shore submarine structures in Japanese sea</li>
<li>500-tonne stones
laser-cut 5000 years ago in Bolivia</li>
<li>the Inca city of
Sacsayhuaman and its assembly of 20-kilotonne massive stones </li>
</ul><p>Such a broad range of civilizations will result in a very
complex, diversified and therefore unique atmosphere and environment, that
people interested in History and myths will definitely enjoy. Other series,
such as Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider or even some Tintin or Blake &amp; Mortimer
have explored these poorly documented or still mysterious parts of the History
and made it popular.
</p><p>Atlas intends to throw a light on these abnormals histories
through a wise combination of facts and science fiction.</p>

along the North Sea. He may even have sailed to the Baltic Sea.
He
was considered a liar by contemporary geographers and scholars who could not
admit the existence of a frozen seawater. His travel notes and especially his
astronomic observations had remained disregarded for a long time.
The
choice of Pytheas’ life as a background for Altas story appeared obvious to us
as he is a testimony of the exchanges that happened in the ancient Europe
between north and south, involving Greece, France, northern and central Europe.
This is a unique adventure for people passionate about Nordics and Greeks
worlds. Finally, he was for sure a controversial person at his times who turned
out to be right ! Atlas story will be backed up with strong historical
research.
Script
A thick fog hides Artemis’ arrow. The fifty rowers have
slowed down as the greek galley is now crossing the enormous ice rocks
described by Atlas’ father, Pytheas, in his travel notes. Sirius, Pytheas most
loyal companion, is standing next to Atlas. He was part of the first trip to the
Northern lands and is now so tired of this ice sea that he tries hard to
convince Atlas to give up and command to turn back to Massalia. This
discussion outstands in the worrying silence of the crew, now speechless as a
giant iceberg progressively appears from the fog. It is too late to
turn back : the boat is about to smash on the iceberg despite rowers
efforts.

About the artist, graphics and motivations
Theudbalder – graphist, colorist and scriptwriter
Independent graphist graduated in graphic arts, with
experiences as concept artist, 3D graphist, illustrator in the video game
industry as well as plastic figurines and card games designer.
He is working simultaneously on several independent scify
comics books, including « Atlas », his main project as author and
graphic illustrator.
Celtine – Inking, graphist & scriptwriter
Originally a designer, she moved toward graphic arts and
illustration. She is particularly interested in the relationship between nature
and mankind. She joined the project and brought not only her expertise but also
a feminine view to the script.
Atlas adventures will leverage some mysteries that the most
advanced sciences have not been able to explain so far:

Perfect iron
spheres discovered in South Africa, dated to 3 billion years.
Nanotech
developed 2000 years ago and recently discovered in Oural mountains
Chinese
alluminium bronze, alloy forgotten for 1500 years
Light bulbs
painted on 4200-year-old Egyptian low reliefs
Electric
batteries unveiled close to Bagdad, dated to 2500 BC
Unexplained
off-shore submarine structures in Japanese sea
500-tonne stones
laser-cut 5000 years ago in Bolivia
the Inca city of
Sacsayhuaman and its assembly of 20-kilotonne massive stones 
Such a broad range of civilizations will result in a very
complex, diversified and therefore unique atmosphere and environment, that
people interested in History and myths will definitely enjoy. Other series,
such as Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider or even some Tintin or Blake & Mortimer
have explored these poorly documented or still mysterious parts of the History
and made it popular.
Atlas intends to throw a light on these abnormals histories
through a wise combination of facts and science fiction.",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

Szóval az ember ha nyugalomra vágyik is, problémákra mindig számíthat.<br/><br/>Főhősünk, Azzedar ezzel tisztában is van: a helyi vár egyik parancsnokaként a veszély az életéhez tartozik.

Ezt még legjobb barátjának, Mizának sem árulja el, aki elkíséri a hosszú útra. <br/><br/>Vajon sikerül gondtalanul célba érniük vagy a legvakmerőbbek még a felkészült harcosnak is gondot okoznak? Ráadásul egy régen látott idegen is a nyomukba szegődik. Számíthatnak-e bármiféle segítségre, ha erőik, készleteik megfogynak? Lehet, hogy fel kell áldozniuk a szállítmányt?

<span><span></span></span>
</div><span><span>Egy katonatiszt, aki hosszú utat járt be, hogy elérje ezt a rangot.  A karakter szinte életre kel, ahogy a mindennapi és történetbeli események által inspirálva fejlődik évről-évre a jelleme. Gladiátorként kezdte, miután a <b>sötételfek </b>rajtaütés után elhurcolták otthonából nagy vérengzések közepette. Mivel az embertelen körülmények és brutális harcok ellenére mégis életben maradt, felkeltette a feljebbvalók figyelmét, és alantas rabszolgából figyelmesen képzett katonává képezték. Sok évnyi gyötrődés után volt csak képes elszabadulni onnan, nagy árat fizetve. A valaha kedves kölyökből egy barbár vadállat vált, aki ráadásul nagyon vágyott a rég óta nélkülözött élvezetekre. Nem állíthatta meg senki és semmi.  Úgy érezte, mivel a világ szemét volt vele, ő is nyugodt szívvel kihasználhat másokat. Sehol sem találta a helyét a világban, így csak vándorolt. Félig ember, félig elf lévén egyik közösség sem igazán kívánta a köreibe, ezt pedig csak tetőzte féktelen viselkedése és elviselhetetlen modora. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457367681/mtr73st5ktjvc40aiddu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span></span><br/><span><span><p></p>
<p><span><span></span></span></p>Ahogy telt az idő, egyre több külső hatás érte, illetve újabb pofonok az élettől. Mindez folyamatosan formálta a látásmódját, és felhagyott eddigi életvitelével: megpróbált jó ember lenni. Persze ez nem azt jelenti, hogy az élete ezúttal tökéletes irányba haladt. A sors kereke ismét a szenvedést sorsolta neki. A nehéz helyzetek annyira eldurvultak, hogy még egy igazán erős <b>démonnal</b> is meggyűlt a baja, aki ismét fenekestől felforgatta az életét. Az eset miatt elhagyta akkori szerelme is, ami jóval hozzájárult Azzedar komor viselkedéséhez. Csupán kevesekkel osztja meg mi is történt akkor valójában. <br/>De az élet egy nagy kocka, nem csak árnyoldala van. A vándorlása alatt összefutott <b>Mizával</b>, a lánnyal, aki képes volt újra megnevettetni. Elkezdte harcra tanítani, és ha bajba is kerültek, ezúttal tudta, hogy nincs egyedül. Nem úgy tekintett a lányra, mint akit óvni kell, hanem aki az oldalán harcol. Sok évet töltöttek együtt, mire ismét elváltak egy időre. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457183807/mm3uv1g3dfeijgggza7a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span></span><p><span>A jelenlegi fordulópont szerint Azzedar elkeveredett <b>Esras birodalmába</b>,
 ahol segített egy kisebb csatában kimenteni a civileket, és a bajba 
jutott csapatot, akik vezető nélkül maradtak. Lehetőséget kapott 
szolgálni a helyi seregben, egyúttal életében először úgy érezte, 
otthonra lelt. Ugyanakkor szinte senki sem tudja mi az a sötét titok, 
ami miatt folyton rosszul alszik. Talán a lezáratlan múlt? Feldúlt 
érzelmek? Vagy egy társ hiánya? <br/></span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><h3><b><i>Ookamiza Caelum</i></b></h3><p>Miza, avagy teljes nevén Ookamiza Caelum egy hosszú éveken át visszavezethető máguscsalád sarja. Csupán kölyökkorában szerzett tudomást képességeiről, mivel anyja minden áron ki akart szakadni a mágia sötét ügyleteivel teli világából. Amikor az anyját sötétmágusok származása miatt brutálisan kivégezték, a lány apját depresszió gyötörte. <br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457365892/vqnkduu2fwatzjlavm28.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Miza így négy bátyjára lett utalva. Kezelhetetlen, szószátyár kis bajkeverő volt, aki apja példájából tanulva optimistán próbált a dolgokhoz állni. Ebben az időben kezdtek kibontakozni a képességei is. Mivel a lány olyan helyen élt, ahol a mágia nem volt elfogadott, egy vándor mágushoz szegődött tanítványként, aki nem csak alakváltó képességeinek kihasználására, hanem életre is tanította. A mesterével töltött évek alatt sokat fejlődött, majd tanulmányait rövid ideig mágusiskolában folytatta. Rövid idő elteltével megszökött a mestere után, aki nyomtalanul eltűnt. Országról-országra kóborolva találkozott Azzedarral egy kellemetlen baleset során. A férfi kezdetek óta rokonszenves volt neki, hiszen valahol belül mindketten súlyos veszteségeket szenvedtek a maguk módján. Egymást kiegészítve balhéból balhéba csöppenve járták az országokat, míg az útjuk egy kis időre szétvált. <br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457367919/zlpxzfs0yxgrwmdaynoc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Miza keveset tudott a mágus felmenőiről és szétválásukkor nyomozni kezdett, amely fenekestül felforgatta az egész eddigi életét. Afféle sötét korszakot élt meg akkoriban. Teljesen kifordult magából és a bosszú éltette, míg végül kegyetlen tervében kudarcot vallva elmenekült az általa kreált káoszból. Ismét vándorlással és bujdosással teltek a napjai. Többé kevésbé rendezte az életét. Később sok felhalmozódott szívesség árán lehetőséget kapott a világ túlsó felén a Köd országában, ahol jelenleg követként szolgál. A Gaiában évente megrendezett versenyeken először résztvevőként, majd később bíraként szerepelt. Vajon az Azzedarral való szoros kapcsolata átalakult az idő múltával?

Gaia fővárosában, Castelben is gyakran történnek kisebb-nagyobb összetűzések a szegénynegyedekben, sikátorokban. Szóval az ember ha nyugalomra vágyik is, problémákra mindig számíthat.Főhősünk, Azzedar ezzel tisztában is van: a helyi vár egyik parancsnokaként a veszély az életéhez tartozik. Amikor a szomszéd országba indul, még nem gondolja, hogy egy apró, meggondolatlan elszólás milyen szóbeszédet okoz a városban az ő titkos küldetéséről.  Kincsvadászok, banditák, szélhámosok tömegeihez is eljut a hír, de vajon mi lehet az az érték, amit rábíztak? Ezt még legjobb barátjának, Mizának sem árulja el, aki elkíséri a hosszú útra. Vajon sikerül gondtalanul célba érniük vagy a legvakmerőbbek még a felkészült harcosnak is gondot okoznak? Ráadásul egy régen látott idegen is a nyomukba szegődik. Számíthatnak-e bármiféle segítségre, ha erőik, készleteik megfogynak? Lehet, hogy fel kell áldozniuk a szállítmányt? Azzedarnak nem csak a külső problémákkal kell szembenéznie, de saját belső démonaival is. Középkori fantasy univerzumban helyezkedik el.  Esras világát négy ország alkotja:
Azzedar Ranthalion


(Azzedar as character in Neverwinter. Art by me)


Egy katonatiszt, aki hosszú utat járt be, hogy elérje ezt a rangot.  A karakter szinte életre kel, ahogy a mindennapi és történetbeli események által inspirálva fejlődik évről-évre a jelleme. Gladiátorként kezdte, miután a sötételfek rajtaütés után elhurcolták otthonából nagy vérengzések közepette. Mivel az embertelen körülmények és brutális harcok ellenére mégis életben maradt, felkeltette a feljebbvalók figyelmét, és alantas rabszolgából figyelmesen képzett katonává képezték. Sok évnyi gyötrődés után volt csak képes elszabadulni onnan, nagy árat fizetve. A valaha kedves kölyökből egy barbár vadállat vált, aki ráadásul nagyon vágyott a rég óta nélkülözött élvezetekre. Nem állíthatta meg senki és semmi.  Úgy érezte, mivel a világ szemét volt vele, ő is nyugodt szívvel kihasználhat másokat. Sehol sem találta a helyét a világban, így csak vándorolt. Félig ember, félig elf lévén egyik közösség sem igazán kívánta a köreibe, ezt pedig csak tetőzte féktelen viselkedése és elviselhetetlen modora. 
Ahogy telt az idő, egyre több külső hatás érte, illetve újabb pofonok az élettől. Mindez folyamatosan formálta a látásmódját, és felhagyott eddigi életvitelével: megpróbált jó ember lenni. Persze ez nem azt jelenti, hogy az élete ezúttal tökéletes irányba haladt. A sors kereke ismét a szenvedést sorsolta neki. A nehéz helyzetek annyira eldurvultak, hogy még egy igazán erős démonnal is meggyűlt a baja, aki ismét fenekestől felforgatta az életét. Az eset miatt elhagyta akkori szerelme is, ami jóval hozzájárult Azzedar komor viselkedéséhez. Csupán kevesekkel osztja meg mi is történt akkor valójában. De az élet egy nagy kocka, nem csak árnyoldala van. A vándorlása alatt összefutott Mizával, a lánnyal, aki képes volt újra megnevettetni. Elkezdte harcra tanítani, és ha bajba is kerültek, ezúttal tudta, hogy nincs egyedül. Nem úgy tekintett a lányra, mint akit óvni kell, hanem aki az oldalán harcol. Sok évet töltöttek együtt, mire ismét elváltak egy időre. A jelenlegi fordulópont szerint Azzedar elkeveredett Esras birodalmába,
 ahol segített egy kisebb csatában kimenteni a civileket, és a bajba 
jutott csapatot, akik vezető nélkül maradtak. Lehetőséget kapott 
szolgálni a helyi seregben, egyúttal életében először úgy érezte, 
otthonra lelt. Ugyanakkor szinte senki sem tudja mi az a sötét titok, 
ami miatt folyton rosszul alszik. Talán a lezáratlan múlt? Feldúlt 
érzelmek? Vagy egy társ hiánya? Ookamiza CaelumMiza, avagy teljes nevén Ookamiza Caelum egy hosszú éveken át visszavezethető máguscsalád sarja. Csupán kölyökkorában szerzett tudomást képességeiről, mivel anyja minden áron ki akart szakadni a mágia sötét ügyleteivel teli világából. Amikor az anyját sötétmágusok származása miatt brutálisan kivégezték, a lány apját depresszió gyötörte. Miza így négy bátyjára lett utalva. Kezelhetetlen, szószátyár kis bajkeverő volt, aki apja példájából tanulva optimistán próbált a dolgokhoz állni. Ebben az időben kezdtek kibontakozni a képességei is. Mivel a lány olyan helyen élt, ahol a mágia nem volt elfogadott, egy vándor mágushoz szegődött tanítványként, aki nem csak alakváltó képességeinek kihasználására, hanem életre is tanította. A mesterével töltött évek alatt sokat fejlődött, majd tanulmányait rövid ideig mágusiskolában folytatta. Rövid idő elteltével megszökött a mestere után, aki nyomtalanul eltűnt. Országról-országra kóborolva találkozott Azzedarral egy kellemetlen baleset során. A férfi kezdetek óta rokonszenves volt neki, hiszen valahol belül mindketten súlyos veszteségeket szenvedtek a maguk módján. Egymást kiegészítve balhéból balhéba csöppenve járták az országokat, míg az útjuk egy kis időre szétvált. Miza keveset tudott a mágus felmenőiről és szétválásukkor nyomozni kezdett, amely fenekestül felforgatta az egész eddigi életét. Afféle sötét korszakot élt meg akkoriban. Teljesen kifordult magából és a bosszú éltette, míg végül kegyetlen tervében kudarcot vallva elmenekült az általa kreált káoszból. Ismét vándorlással és bujdosással teltek a napjai. Többé kevésbé rendezte az életét. Később sok felhalmozódott szívesség árán lehetőséget kapott a világ túlsó felén a Köd országában, ahol jelenleg követként szolgál. A Gaiában évente megrendezett versenyeken először résztvevőként, majd később bíraként szerepelt. Vajon az Azzedarral való szoros kapcsolata átalakult az idő múltával? Hová fejlődhet mindez? Sziasztok!Fantasy képregényt készítek World of Esras címen. Szükségem lenne a támogatásotokra, hogy minél többet tudjak nyomtatni. A képregény már majdnem teljesen kész, így garantáltan meglesz nyár közepéig, viszont szűkös a keret, és a támogatásoddal lehetővé tennéd, hogy több emberhez eljusson. Ha támogatni szeretnél, a következőképpen segíthetsz:
1. Megoszthatod az oldalt, terjesztheted olyanok felé, akit érdekelhet, szívesen olvasná.
2. Te magad is felajánlasz valamekkora összeget. Regisztráció után a jobb oldali menükből választhatod ki a számodra kedvező összeget. A használata igen egyszerű. Ha nyomtatott könyvet szeretnél, cím megadása is lehetséges.

A projectet flexible fundingra állítottam, ami azt jelenti, hogy akkor is megkapom az összeget, ha nem érjük el a célt. Ezzel az opcióval volt lehetséges, hogy bankkártyával is tudjatok fizetni. Én akkor is arra buzdítanálak, hogy érjük el azt az 500 dollárt! :) Ahogy Stan Lee mondta: ""Comics are like boobs. They look great on a computer, but I'd rather hold one in my hand..."" Gondolom,
 ti is sokan vagytok így. És bizonyára sokaknak közületek volt is 
hasonló kezdeményezése. Szóval tudjátok, hogy a nyomda és a többi milyen
 őrült drága, ha nem nagy tömegben csinálod. Íme a statisztika: Eredetileg a mangamagazine.net (Inkblazers.com) oldalán próbáltam volna kiadót / támogatókat találni. Az oldal lehúzta a rolót, én pedig már belefogtam a projectbe. Szeretném végigcsinálni, igaz így egy rövidebb történettel tudok szolgálni, mint eredetileg terveztem, mert sokat számít a költségvetésben az oldalszám. Megpróbáltam a lehető legkedvezőbb árat nyújtani nektek, szóval mindenképp megéri befizetni rá, mert egy olyan projectet támogatsz vele, ami nélküled nem valósulna meg, és egy olyan terméket kapsz, ami azon felül, hogy igényes, szórakoztató és tanulságos, még egyéb extrákat is kapsz hozzá. Az első 10 előrendelő lesz olyan szerencsés, hogy ezek közül a szuper cuki matricákból kapni fog egyet (mind különböző, ez nem a teljes készlet) Csak azokra érvényes, akik minimum 8 dollárt küldenek. Aggodalomra semmi ok, aki nem tud előrendelni, conra is marad tíz a leggyorsabbaknak. ;) További extrák:700 dollár célelérés - extra szexi illusztrációk a karakterekről a képregénybe kiegészítőnek850 dollár célelérés - Mindenki, aki 8 dollárral és afelett támogatott, kap egy Esras kitűzőt 1000 dollár célelérés - Mindenki, aki 8 dollárral és afelett támogatott, kap egy Esras üdvözlőlapot és könyvjelzőt.Összefoglaló:

Riusciranno queste paladine dei più deboli a scongiurare le assurde trame dei loro oscuri nemici?The Cos-fighters ""cos evoluzione"" è il secondo capitolo della serie di Marcello Cavalli, ideata assieme a Carlo Alberto Montori. Nasce dalla fusione del fotoromanzo e del fumetto, per raccontare una storia comica e avventurosa, a metà tra il mondo della fantasia e la vita di tutti i giorni, di un gruppo di giovani nerd. Pur trattandosi di un secondo volume, l'assoluta autoconclusività della storia, lo rende piacevolissimo alla lettura senza bisogno di aver letto il primo capitolo.
Amiche unite e tanto girl power!Ali, Vicky e Mav sono tre ragazze di circa 25 anni che frequentano l'università assieme ai loro amici Teo, Filo e Luke. Tutti i membri del gruppo sono accomunati dalla passione per la cultura nerd di cui parlano non solo nelle aule universitarie, ma anche in fumetteria e nel loro amato pub. Quando le tre ragazze, un po' per curiosità e un po' per gioco, provano a farsi delle identità segrete e si improvvisano supereroine, scoprono una realtà impensata, nella quale una potente società segreta trama contro tutti i nerd. Vivendo avventure a metà strada tra la realtà e la loro fantasia, affrontano i loro nemici così come avrebbero fatto i paladini a cui si ispirano: inventandosi armi, costumi, stili di combattimento, in una lotta tra il bene e il male a suon di colte citazioni nerd. Saprete coglierle tutte? Non importa, perché The Cos-fighters ha più livelli di lettura ed è godibile anche se non siete degli irriducibili appassionati di supereroi e manga, proprio come una puntata di Big Bang Theory.
La fumettizzazioneIl photocomic è ottenuto partendo da immagini fotografiche create in veri set e con veri attori, immagini che sono state rese ""fumettose"" attraverso l'uso di filtri ed elaborazioni grafiche, in modo da creare contorni, colori, toni e retini tipici del fumetto. Nel secondo volume la fumettizzazione è stata migliorata, per ottenere un effetto ancora più simile a quello del disegno.
La variant coverThe Cos-fighters - cos evoluzione vanta la copertina alternativa creata dal grandissimo Leo Ortolani. Che siate collezionisti o meno, non potete perdervela!!!

<h3>General Washington: Victory or Death</h3>

<p>In order to get the kind of low printing costs that will make this work, we need to get at least 500 subscribers right from the start.</p>
<p>If we reach this number, we'll be able to move forward! And to ensure we do, we're offering our Indiegogo boxes at a <strong>big discount</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Here's why we're so excited about getting InkBot off the ground:</p>
<ul>
<li>We'll be exposing people to unique artistic creations that can't be bought on Amazon or at Walmart.</li>
<li>It will give around 50 small press creators every year access to hundreds (hopefully thousands) of readers they wouldn't otherwise be able to reach.</li>
<li>It will put hundreds - if not thousands - of dollars into the pockets of hard-working, creative, small press creators</li>
<li>This is a profit-sharing venture with our staff. So the more subscriptions we get, the more their wages increase.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk involves the attrition rate once subscribers' Indiegogo InkBot boxes are up for renewal at the regular price.</p>
<p>We're significantly discounting these boxes on Indiegogo in order to gain the numbers we need to drive printing prices down.</p>
<p>If not enough people renew, and our campaign to sign subscribers to the service outside of Indiegogo isn't replacing them fast enough, we might not be able to continue to offer affordable boxes.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Share this campaign! And if you know a small press creator yourself, send them to <a href=""http://www.inkbotcomics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.inkbotcomics.com</a> and encourage them to submit their work for inclusion in one of our boxes.</p>
</div></div>","The Gist
All around the world hard-working, creative artists and writers are making and self-publishing their own comics. 
But working without a big publisher, it's not easy getting comics into the hands of people who would enjoy reading them if only they came across them.
Enter InkBot! Our staff scouts out the best small press comics we can find, package them up and ship them off to you each month so you don't have to spend your money and time hunting for them.

The Impact

Here's why we're so excited about getting InkBot off the ground:

We'll be exposing people to unique artistic creations that can't be bought on Amazon or at Walmart.
It will give around 50 small press creators every year access to hundreds (hopefully thousands) of readers they wouldn't otherwise be able to reach.
It will put hundreds - if not thousands - of dollars into the pockets of hard-working, creative, small press creators
This is a profit-sharing venture with our staff. So the more subscriptions we get, the more their wages increase.

 

Risks & Challenges
The risk involves the attrition rate once subscribers' Indiegogo InkBot boxes are up for renewal at the regular price.
We're significantly discounting these boxes on Indiegogo in order to gain the numbers we need to drive printing prices down.
If not enough people renew, and our campaign to sign subscribers to the service outside of Indiegogo isn't replacing them fast enough, we might not be able to continue to offer affordable boxes.

</div></div>","Short Summary
HI guys! My name is Emily Ree and I'm the creator of Anarchy Dreamers. I am an independent comic artist, writer, colorist, and educator from New York and have 4 successful crowdfunding campaigns under my belt!
Anarchy Dreamers is an urban fantasy comic about sparkly undead kids fighting society's worst Nightmares. I ran a successful campaign to print Anarchy Dreamers volume 1 last fall, a 160 paged paperback graphic novel. The campaign was very successful and the first edition of volume 1 hit the shelves in February 2017! 

As soon as distribution began, I knew that we'd run out of volume 1 faster than I originally anticipated. I figured we'd run out by the end of 2017, maybe the beginning of 2018. My intention had been to package reprinting Volume 1 and the first run of Volume 2 in one big kickstarter, most likely launching in summer 2018. 
But here we are in the summer of 2017. Less than 20 books left, with two large conventions coming up in the fall.
We gotta print more books!
What We Need & What You Get

This campaign is to assist in reprinting volume 1! 
What does that mean?

The funds collected from this campaign will help me print more books.


THIS IS NOT A PREORDER FOR A BOOK! All funds are donations to help me offset the cost of the reprint.
Most of the money for the reprints will be coming from original book sales and Patreon. Printing books is expensive and shipping them to my house is almost as expensive as printing them! Any help I can get is wonderful and incredibly helpful!

But you will get something for your donation!
Anyone who donates $10 or more will get a thank you card with an Anarchy Dreamers sketch ! You can tell me what you'd like me to draw, or leave it up to me. : ) Ships anywhere in the world, stationary is guaranteed to be cute!

The Impact
With your help, I will be able to print more comics and promote Anarchy Dreamers even more than before! Without printing assistance, I won't be able to print enough books to hold us until next summer. 

Risks & Challenges
The book already exists, this is simply a reprint.
Aside from the post office losing your card, there are no other risks or challenges. 

Other Ways You Can Help

<p>Hi there, welcome to the Indiegogo page for Digitopia 1 + 2 comic book, <u><strong>we're ready to send the book to the printer</strong></u>. </p>
<p>We wanted to run a quick campaign for those who may have missed the Kickstarter to get themselves a copy of the book before we send the final order to the printer.</p>
<p>This is a really short campaign duration - so please get your copy now, we're looking to send final numbers to the printer on Dec 1st.  </p>

<h3><i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Digitopia is a pre-apocalyptic action adventure story of a father and daughter trying to survive in a civilisation that is imploding, where everyone from the army, society and bounty hunters are out to get them. </span></i></h3>

<p>We tackle some pretty hard hitting issues in these books including </p>
<ul>
<li>the rise of the hard right</li>
<li>fake wars and the brutality of the state</li>
<li>fake news and what drives media biases </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>all encapsulated in a super high adrenaline action adventure - think '<strong>The Matrix' meets 'The Running Man'.  </strong></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In many ways Digitopia explores a lot of the issues that we are facing today.</p>

<p>See any parallels between this book and the real world?</p>
<p>You don't have to look to the other side of the world to see these things, this is happening in our own Western culture, these things are happening now - if we don't make a stand against this, it will only get worse.</p> <h3>But will backing a comic book make a change?</h3>
<p>It won't solve everything, but you're sending out a signal </p>
<ul>
<li>that we want new content, </li>
<li>we want content that speaks to our problems and </li>
<li> we want content that challenges the status quo not reinforces it.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The number of books that we ask the printer to order will be based on the number of backers we get in this campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>If these are issues that you care about and want to be part of a change then please back this project today</i></strong></p>

<p><strong>Farhan Quresh</strong>i the writer, who has been writing for many years, feature film, animation and now comic books.  </p>
<p>About the script Farhan says that 'the script for Digitopia 2.0 is unequivocally the best writing I've ever done, then I gave it to Hass, who made the script twice as good'.  </p>
<p><strong>Hassan Ostmane-Elhaou</strong> edited Digitopia 1.0 and Digitopia 2.0 - he also edits PanelxPanel.  </p>
<p>Together with our amazingly talented art team, <strong>Tom Hoskisson </strong>is on pencils and inks and <strong>Simon Robins</strong>, Art Director, Colourist and Letterer - the layout, inks and colours produced elevates the story to a whole new level.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>This isn't the first book we've made - this team will deliver!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>With the help of nearly 200 backers, we successfully launched Issue 1 of Digitopia the comic book series back in 2018 and 2019.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Following on from the Kickstarter, we launched the book on Amazon where it became an Amazon best seller - hitting the number 1 spot on Amazon in the comic's section.  </p>

</div><p>Thanks so much for all your support, we can't wait to get your books to you.</p><p>Farhan</p></div>","Hi there, welcome to the Indiegogo page for Digitopia 1 + 2 comic book, we're ready to send the book to the printer. 
We wanted to run a quick campaign for those who may have missed the Kickstarter to get themselves a copy of the book before we send the final order to the printer.
This is a really short campaign duration - so please get your copy now, we're looking to send final numbers to the printer on Dec 1st.  
What is Digitopia the comic book?
 

Digitopia is a pre-apocalyptic action adventure story of a father and daughter trying to survive in a civilisation that is imploding, where everyone from the army, society and bounty hunters are out to get them. 
 

 

We tackle some pretty hard hitting issues in these books including 

the rise of the hard right
fake wars and the brutality of the state
fake news and what drives media biases 

 
all encapsulated in a super high adrenaline action adventure - think 'The Matrix' meets 'The Running Man'.  
 

 


The Impact
In many ways Digitopia explores a lot of the issues that we are facing today.
 

 
See any parallels between this book and the real world?
You don't have to look to the other side of the world to see these things, this is happening in our own Western culture, these things are happening now - if we don't make a stand against this, it will only get worse. But will backing a comic book make a change?
It won't solve everything, but you're sending out a signal 

that we want new content, 
we want content that speaks to our problems and 
 we want content that challenges the status quo not reinforces it.

 
The number of books that we ask the printer to order will be based on the number of backers we get in this campaign.
 
If these are issues that you care about and want to be part of a change then please back this project today
 
Want to see the Art Work?
Here's are the first few pages from Digitopia 1 - these are all complete!
 



If you love action adventure comics you are going to love Digitopia.  
Issue 1 is all ready, we're putting final the touches of Issue 2 this week (Nov 23rd), we're aiming to get a physical print proof to sign off the week (Nov 23rd).  When this campiagn ends, we'll be looking to send the final numbers to the printer.  
This campaign is for both

backers who are new to the series and 
backers who are already on-board with issue 1.

Meet the team
 

 
Farhan Qureshi the writer, who has been writing for many years, feature film, animation and now comic books.  
About the script Farhan says that 'the script for Digitopia 2.0 is unequivocally the best writing I've ever done, then I gave it to Hass, who made the script twice as good'.  
Hassan Ostmane-Elhaou edited Digitopia 1.0 and Digitopia 2.0 - he also edits PanelxPanel.  
Together with our amazingly talented art team, Tom Hoskisson is on pencils and inks and Simon Robins, Art Director, Colourist and Letterer - the layout, inks and colours produced elevates the story to a whole new level.  
 
This isn't the first book we've made - this team will deliver!
 
With the help of nearly 200 backers, we successfully launched Issue 1 of Digitopia the comic book series back in 2018 and 2019.  
 
Following on from the Kickstarter, we launched the book on Amazon where it became an Amazon best seller - hitting the number 1 spot on Amazon in the comic's section.  
 

 

 

 

You can see the project has come together really well.  We aim to make this comic book something very special indeed.  
We believe this book touches issues and challenges we face in a fresh original way - we hope you'll be able to get involved in this really exciting project. 
Thanks for your support!
Farhan

<h3>Dottie's Diary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Dottie's Diary is inspired by the love of my life, my cute and fluffy little diva bunny! My name is Roxanne and I live in The Netherlands. Dottie's Diary is created by me but my friends, family and everybody around me inspire the topics for drawings I make.</p>
<p>It started with Facebook, I asked my friends to say a word and I would make a drawing about that topic. Then they started to mail me for personalised drawings and shortly after they asked me if I would maybe consider making a calender. So I thought why not give it a shot! ;)</p>
<p>By helping me and Dottie you will contribute to feel good adventures, a little bit of creativity to start your day with a smile! </p>

<p>Dottie's Diary is my signature cartoon which makes it unique! Donate € 500,- and you'll get a lead character in a Dottie's Diary serie. Isn't that the most unique gift you can think off? :D</p>
<p>The best (not so best for me..) part is that you will receive your money back if I don't make my goal..But I have faith and Dottie think she was born to be famous, so I guess we have nothing to lose!</p>

</div></div>","Doctor Dream issue 2 is available NOW on IndieGoGo!
Continuing the story of Sora Tengoku, we see the gifted doctor now able to help more people with their disturbing dreams and debilitating nightmares. But this new fame has also gained the attention of Dr. Weir who is obsessed with Dr. Dream's powers and seeks to capture those powers for himself--whatever the cost!


The team behind Dr. Dream: Keith Carmona (writer), Federico Sioc, Jr. (artist), Diego Vasquez (colors).
Dr. Dream is a 12 page all ages comic and the second book in the series. It is a classic good guy/bad guy story that kids enjoy and adults have come to love!
All the goodies from a comic convention...right to your door!
That's right! Since we can't meet in person, we'll bring the convention to you. In addition to the great items that went with the first issue, we've also got:

t-shirts
masks
stickers

You can also get Dr. Dream issue 1 as well!
New to the series? Here's your chance to get the 29 page award winning 1st issue--now, for the first time,  in both print and digital versions. Keep the prints at home and take the digitals with you in high resolution pdfs.

STRETCH GOALS:
IF WE HIT $500, all levels will get a digital wallpaper Dr Dream collage by Eli Beaird, exclusive to this Indiegogo campaign!

 
If we reach our goal of $2,000, all Double Dream and higher levels will get a physical print of the Dr. Dream collage by Eli Beaird!
 
The Goal
The goal with this campaign is to bring you fun entertaining stories featuring art by some of the best graphic storytellers. I will be shipping all materials utilizing Gemini Comic Flash Mailers so everything arrives in crisp, mint condition. 

Risks & Challenges
Okay--this is borrowed language from my publisher Jason Dube--but hey, why mess with  a good thing, right?
""The comic books are all completed. Everything is done, we just need to get it to the printers and ship it to you. Of course this is life and I suppose anything can happen, but I really don't foresee any kind of delay in getting these into your hands.""

<p><strong>“Prepare yourself for the most brutal Sport in the galaxy”</strong></p>
<p>After witnessing the brutality of society via a randomized event on the street, an Overlord from the Planet Chaos, a realm where fighting to the death is not only a right but also a way of life, becomes enamored with the violence that desperation can cause. Inspired by a chance encounter with an old fighting show while blitzed out of his mind following a rough day at work, the wheels and cogs of his demented brain began to turn, launching into action the most vile and bloody gladiator fight in the history of the galaxy: The Intergalactic Deathmatch!</p>
<p>The most entertaining and capable fighters from all across the universe were gathered up, willingly or not, and dumped into a gauntlet fight where only one can come out alive and reign supreme</p>

The main challenge of this project is to get it succesfully funded. 

When it comes to the book print and other products, I am more than confident in being able to get them done in a timely manner and in quality I myself would be happy with. The artwork for the comic has been long finished, so I just need to get it to print. 

For Printing I intend to use the services and expertise of Comic Printing UK. They have been very happy to give me the insight I've needed to tally up the upcoming expenses and needs, and I've had previous experience working with them. Much appreciated! 

Then of course, there is Shipping. Not as much a challenge as a time consuming process, but it is arguably the most expensive part of the funding.



I'm a 25 year old artist in Finland, who goes by the name of Mikael H.Formerly Karoliina H, the display name was changed in 2017.For the curious, the character in the comic isn't a self-insert.During 2017 I have had certain decisions made regarding my personal life, and I've adapted the name ""Mikael"" as an artist alias.

I studied cinema and video games, and the latter was where I hoped my career would head at. However, one summer I jokingly tried to experiment practicing my drawing in the form of comics, and I've not strayed since.I've been part of 5 crowfunded comic projects in the near past, helping or fully responsible of the art department and supplying campaigns with necessary conceptuals and graphics. It has helped me figure out how this stuff works.Year In Hereafter started updating July 2015, and the website has made over 300 page updates so far. Finishing Volume II isn't too far off and I'm planning to have the second crowfunded later in 2019, should this first volume be succesful.
The comic has been printed in 40~ page issues before, self-fundedly. Quickly I noticed that the short issue format does not suit this comic and I decided to shift to bigger volumes.



Just helping to get the word out is worth its weight in gold.
I wouldn't have gotten to this point if it wasn't for the people who have shared and selflessly helped raise awareness of what I do for the past 3 years, your voice is incredibly helpful to so many people.

<h3>
<br/>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Janibek and I am a mangaka, a comic author &amp; artist for those not familiar with the concept. I have been into arts ever since I came to this world. The pencil has always been in my hand throughout my path from childhood to being a man. I have mostly done arts for myself or for orders by my friends and relatives, but never on a big scale, never gone worldwide. Until now</p>
<p>I was always inspired by the world’s greatest directors and screenwriters, artists and visual artists. Their work seemed stellar, so high on the Olympus that it felt treacherous to try to compete with them, until I realized that I would honor them by doing something of my own. Something to leave my name in history along with other legends</p>
<p>I am just getting started and I strongly believe I will not disappoint. I would be thrilled to share my work with others and hope  we can let this project go along. Together! Without your support and following I am just another artist, but together even the sky is not the limit!</p>
<p>Soul is a Manga format, so please keep in mind to read the panels in the correct order</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>An intriguing and exciting content is on the way, there is a lot I want to tell with this story, but I need your help to keep up the work! Soul opens doors to a deep and complex universe with multiple charaters who will see profound development, the plot is twisted and suspenseful. Such an endeavor is something that cannot rely solely on my persistence and enthusiasm. If you have an opportunity to help, this project will go on!</p>
<p>Perks will be available along the way, just a little extra for a unique contribution from you guys!</p>
<p>The funds will go into printing of chapter 1 'A Dance of Death-Chains' for unique perks and the creation of further chapters which will be at least 90 (long lasting Manga format) in authentic hand-drawn form</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Apart from being a very interesting Sci-Fi story Soul touches upon important issues of the world, some might not be on the surface, but will be seen between the lines. I am not perfect and devoid of subjectivity but I sincerely hope I can bring excitement to my readers</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Soul is my first self-published work and it is quite challenging in terms of funding and time, so there might be be obstacles along the way. But I am sure that all backers will not be dissapointed with the result</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Current status</h3>
<p>Soul Chapter 1 'A Dance of Death-Chains' is 100% finished in terms of drawing and lettering, but has not been printed into hard copies yet. The plan is to proceed with printing upon raising funds along with continuing the works on the next chapters</p>

<p><strong>INTRODUCING THE ""SOME PEOPLE"" (EVERY)BODY EXHIBITION and NATIONAL ENGAGEMENT PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>To positively contribute to the healthcare policy debate and dialogue, I've united a group of top international essayists, journalists, photojournalists, artists, lawyers, medical students and medical brain trust to examine how we view the human body and the business systems that knowingly perpetuate harm. This is not a project about illness. The work reveals universal vulnerability and fragility through personal essays, photography and original new works of art.</p>
<p>The intention of the producer and collective of exceptionally talented contributors is to raise questions about Best Practice, social responsibility, values and fiscal priorities vis-à-vis the never ending healthcare policy debate in the United States.</p>
<p>This first round of fundraising will be allocated to renting the gallery space for our Chicago opening in October 2019 at Bridgeport Art Center and continuing to finance curation, website design and production of the exhibition.</p>
<p><strong>The fundraising goal is $5,000 by April 12th, 2019.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>The healthcare debate has never been louder or more forceful in the United States as business owners grapple with costs, individuals struggle for continuity of high quality healthcare and shareholders begin to question the source of their profits. Nurses, physicians, medical students and healthcare workers are publicly questioning the fiscal priorities and social values of the United States. The level of active organized engagement and mobilization for universal healthcare is unprecedented. </p>
<p>People are asking: Is healthcare a moral, ethical, social, cultural and economic value to which the United States should assign fiscal priority?</p>
<p>We, as a community of engaged colleagues and professionals, believe the role of the artist/journalist/physician/essayist is to raise complex questions with art, images and the written word. We are creating a welcoming digital forum on Instagram—and will soon create the live experience—that invites people to truly see Every Body.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE PRODUCER/ CURATOR </strong> For 25 years, Kimberly J. Soenen has worked for major news, policy and media arts organizations as a producer, writer, business development director and communications strategist. Known for her language fluency across private, nonprofit and public sector her expertise and vision have increased revenue and reach for journalism and media organizations, impacted policy and influenced legislation. Soenen's track record of high level business development, visual communications expertise and creative direction include noteworthy high profile successes at Pulitzer, Oscar, Emmy, World Press and Peabody Award winning companies including Harper's Magazine, National Public Radio, Kartemquin Films, Talking Eyes Media, Chicago Tribune and VII Photo Agency. Soenen is a sought after educator, writer and consultant. She teaches ethics in journalism, media literacy and visual communication. She has been published across policy, thought leadership, culture and news magazines. She resides in her hometown of Chicago.</p>

Guests are provided with full board accommodation, as well as the necessary materials for creation. As a thank you, they commit to create and donate at least one work of art that becomes part of the collection managed by the Friends of SIANOJA Association.</p><h4> </h4><h4>A bit of history...</h4><p>The history of this symposium is experiential and as such, it is not without change: </p><p>In 2017 the new corporation of the Noja City Council withdrew the collaboration with SIANOJA, being this our main sponsor. Given the excellent performance of the symposium during the seventeen years of contract, the City Council received a collection of four hundred and thirty works of art valued at more than one million euros. Resulting in a high return on investment.</p><p>Since then, the financing of this activity, which generates a remarkable cultural capital for all, is the responsibility of the Friends of SIANOJA Association, without forgetting the collaborations that we receive from the private sector: Estelacaeli, Ámbito Cultural El Corte Inglés, Hotel Torre Cristina (current venue of the symposium), Mara Pardo Estudio...</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621638875/negnvagcwbyeak1aiql5.png"" src=""""/></p><p>More than two hundred and fifty artists have passed through SIANOJA, both new and renowned, from more than forty-four countries: Spain, England, China, USA, Switzerland, Mexico, Germany, Japan, Brazil... creating works of art that enrich the heritage value not only of the region, but of all humanity, adding up to a total of five hundred and forty-five works of art created and donated until the previous edition SIANOJA 2020.</p><p>We want to continue with a cultural event so necessary for the advancement and development of the arts, and for this we need your support.

SIANOJA is a totum revolutum of cultural exchange, where creators dialogue, debate and exchange perspectives, with or without a vanishing point, impregnating themselves with new perceptions that are manifested in the following dialogue; the one they maintain with their work during the creation.</p><p>The first pieces of this magical process take place in SIANOJA. They enrich the cultural heritage, not only of Cantabria, but also of humanity, thanks to the vital experience that, as a result of this exchange, the artists, as ambassadors of their land, take back home to their countries.</p><p>From this new language, bifurcations are born in the artistic and cultural expressions, bifurcations that contribute new planes for a prism from which, to understand it and to advance, we catalyze our time.</p><p> </p><h3>The fundraising</h3><h4>We have divided the crowfunding into four milestones:</h4><p><br/><strong>Milestone I</strong>: 9 000 €.</p><p>The funds raised will be used to cover the costs of staging: materials for the production and reproduction of the works of art, the cache, accommodation (full board accommodation plus extra per diem) of the artists and personalities involved. </p><p>As well as the elaboration and distribution of the rewards for you, the micro-members, without whom this would not be possible.</p><p><strong>Milestone II</strong>: 12 000 €.</p><p>Updating and improvement of the web portal <a href=""http://www.sianoja.es.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sianoja.es.com</a> to turn it into a public and virtual museum that will house videography, images and information, both of the artists and of the works of art created during the course of the twenty-one years of SIANOJA's life.</p><p>The portal will have a news time-line to report on activities related to SIANOJA.</p><p><strong>Milestone III</strong>: 22 000 €.</p><p>Because for the love of art many things can be done, but not all. Having passed the previous milestone, you help us to cover the costs of the direction, management and communication of the symposium: Management; Advertising graphics; Marketing: online and offline; Expenses derived as per diems and transportation or secondary activities; etc.. It is a lot of work and a lot of people involved.</p><p><strong>Milestone IV</strong>: +22 000 €.</p><p>These funds will become part of the coffers of the Friends of SIANOJA Association, and will be destined to the continuation and proper functioning of this international symposium in future editions. We will keep you updated on all of them.</p><p>When the funds raised exceed the amount of funding requested for a milestone, they will go to the next milestone.</p><p><strong><i>All funds raised will be used exclusively for the development and realization of SIANOJA.</i></strong></p><p> </p><h3>Perks</h3><h4><strong>Los Factory (Warhol):</strong></h4><ul><li>Eternal Gratitude on:<ul>

Te invitamos a ser mecenas.(Si quieres ver las recompensas, desplaza el video hacia la izquierda o ve a la sección de recompensas al final del texto en Español).Gracias por interesarte por SIANOJA, el encuentro internacional de artistas en Noja, que desde 2001, se celebra anualmente en Cantabria, España. En 21 años que llevamos gestionando y celebrando el simposio, es la primera vez que realizamos un crowdfunding para que formes parte de la financiación del mismo.Te ofrecemos la posibilidad de ser mecenas, lo cual es maravilloso. Estás poniendo la piedra de una genial escultura, el lienzo de un óleo asombroso.Esta edición se celebrará del 13 al 20 de septiembre de 2021 (fecha actualizada) en la actual sede del simposio: El Hotel Torre Cristina. Siete artistas invitados: Ramón Cerezo (España), Monika Grygier (Polonia), Evelyn Hellenschmidt (Alemania),  Lika Shkhvatsabaia (Georgia), Tamara García (España), Pedro Calderón (España), Francisco Díaz (España),   Crítico de Arte invitada: Wendy Navarro ¿Qué es SIANOJA?Desde el 2001, SIANOJA es un simposio que reúne anualmente a artistas plásticos contemporáneos, nacionales e internacionales, en un espacio de convivencia y creación durante diez días (por el actual estado de alarma lo hemos reducido a una semana). Los invitados disfrutan de alojamiento a pensión completa, así como de los materiales necesarios para la creación. A modo de agradecimiento, estos se comprometen a crear y donar al menos una obra de arte que pasa a formar parte de la colección gestionada por la Asociación Amigos de SIANOJA. Un poco de historia...La historia de este simposio es experiencial y como tal, no está exenta de cambios: En 2017 la nueva corporación del Ayuntamiento de Noja retiró la colaboración con SIANOJA, siendo este nuestro principal patrocinador. Dado el excelente rendimiento del simposio durante los diecisiete años de contrato, el Ayuntamiento recibió una colección de cuatrocientas treinta obras de arte valoradas en más de un millón de euros. Resultando un alto valor en el retorno de inversión.Desde entonces, la financiación de esta actividad que genera un notable capital cultural para todos, corre a cuenta de la Asociación Amigos de SIANOJA, sin olvidar las colaboraciones que recibimos por parte del sector privado: Estelacaeli, Ámbito Cultural El Corte Inglés, Hotel Torre Cristina (actual sede del simposio), Mara Pardo Estudio...Por SIANOJA han pasado más de doscientos cincuenta artistas, noveles y de reconocida trayectoria, procedentes de más de cuarenta y cuatro países: España, Inglaterra, China, EE. UU., Suiza, México, Alemania, Japón, Brasil… creando obras de arte que enriquecen el valor patrimonial no solo de la región, sino de toda la humanidad, sumando un total de quinientas cuarenta y cinco obras de arte creadas y donadas hasta la anterior edición SIANOJA 2020.Queremos continuar con un evento cultural tan necesario para el avance y desarrollo de las artes, y para ello necesitamos tu apoyo. Cualquier contribución es bienvenida y nos ayudará a continuar y hacer crecer este singular proyecto.¿Por qué SIANOJA?Los artistas somos catalizadores de nuestro tiempo y SIANOJA más allá de ser un encuentro internacional de artistas, (que puede sonar muy bohemio y hasta “cool”) es un encuentro entre artistas procedentes de los lugares más dispares del planeta, personas con una particular cosmovisión de la vida devenida de la cultura de la que proceden. SIANOJA es un totum revolutum de intercambio cultural, dónde los creadores dialogan, debaten e intercambian perspectivas, con o sin punto de fuga, impregnándose de nuevas percepciones que se manifiestan en el siguiente dialogo; el que mantienen con su obra durante la creación.Las primeras piezas de este mágico proceso se dan lugar en SIANOJA. Enriquecen el patrimonio cultural, no solo de Cantabria, si no de la humanidad, gracias a la experiencia vital que fruto de este intercambio, los artistas, como embajadores de su tierra, portan a sus hogares, a sus países.Desde este nuevo lenguaje nacen bifurcaciones en las expresiones artístico culturales. bifurcaciones que aportan nuevos planos para un prisma desde el que, para comprenderlo y avanzar, catalizamos nuestro tiempo. La recaudaciónEl crowfunding lo hemos seccionado en cuatro hitos:Hito I: 9 000 €Los fondos recaudados se utilizarán para sufragar los costes de puesta en escena: materiales para la producción y reproducción de las obras de arte, el caché, el hospedaje (alojamiento a pensión completa más dietas extras) de los artistas y personalidades implicadas. Así como la elaboración y distribución de las recompensas para ustedes, los micro–mecenas, sin los cuales, esto no sería posible.Hito II: 12 000 €Actualización y mejora del portal web www.sianoja.es.com para convertirlo en un museo público y virtual que alojará videografía, imágenes e información, tanto de los artistas como de las obras de arte creadas durante el transcurso de loa veintiún años de vida de SIANOJA.El portal contará con un time-line de noticias para informar de actividades relacionadas con SIANOJA.Hito III: 22 000 €Porque por amor al arte pueden hacerse muchas cosas, pero no todas. Superado el hito anterior, nos ayudas a costear los gastos de dirección, gestión y comunicación del simposio: Gestorías; Gráfica publicitaria; Marketing: online y offline; Gastos derivados como dietas y transporte o actividades secundarias; etc.. Es mucho trabajo y mucha gente implicada.Hito IV: +22 000 €Estos fondos pasarán a formar parte de las arcas de la Asociación Amigos de SIANOJA, y serán destinados a la continuación y buen funcionamiento de este simposio internacional en ediciones futuras. Te mantendremos al tanto de todas ellas.Cuando los fondos recaudados superen la cantidad de financiación solicitada para un hito, estos irán destinados al hito siguiente.Todos los fondos recaudados serán utilizados exclusivamente para el desarrollo y realización de SIANOJA. RecompensasLos Factory (Warhol):

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We need funding. We invite you to become a patron.Thank you for your interest in SIANOJA, the international meeting of artists in Noja, which since 2001, is held annually in Cantabria, Spain. In 21 years that we have been managing and celebrating the symposium, this is the first time that we make a crowfunding for you to be part of its financing.We offer you the possibility of being a patron, which is wonderful. You are laying the stone of a brilliant sculpture, the canvas of an amazing oil painting.This edition will be held from June 07 to 14, 2021 at the current venue of the symposium: The Torre Cristina Hotel.The seven artists: Ramón Cerezo (España), Monika Grygier (Polonia), Evelyn Hellenschmidt (Alemania),  Lika Shkhvatsabaia (Georgia), Tamara García (España), Pedro Calderón (España), Francisco Díaz (España),   Guest Art critic: Wendy Navarro What is SIANOJA?Since 2001, SIANOJA is a symposium that annually brings together national and international contemporary visual artists in a space of coexistence and creation for ten days (due to the current state of alarm we have reduced it to one week). Guests are provided with full board accommodation, as well as the necessary materials for creation. As a thank you, they commit to create and donate at least one work of art that becomes part of the collection managed by the Friends of SIANOJA Association. A bit of history...The history of this symposium is experiential and as such, it is not without change: In 2017 the new corporation of the Noja City Council withdrew the collaboration with SIANOJA, being this our main sponsor. Given the excellent performance of the symposium during the seventeen years of contract, the City Council received a collection of four hundred and thirty works of art valued at more than one million euros. Resulting in a high return on investment.Since then, the financing of this activity, which generates a remarkable cultural capital for all, is the responsibility of the Friends of SIANOJA Association, without forgetting the collaborations that we receive from the private sector: Estelacaeli, Ámbito Cultural El Corte Inglés, Hotel Torre Cristina (current venue of the symposium), Mara Pardo Estudio...More than two hundred and fifty artists have passed through SIANOJA, both new and renowned, from more than forty-four countries: Spain, England, China, USA, Switzerland, Mexico, Germany, Japan, Brazil... creating works of art that enrich the heritage value not only of the region, but of all humanity, adding up to a total of five hundred and forty-five works of art created and donated until the previous edition SIANOJA 2020.We want to continue with a cultural event so necessary for the advancement and development of the arts, and for this we need your support. Any contribution is welcome and will help us to continue and grow this unique project.Why SIANOJA?Artists are catalysts of our time and SIANOJA, beyond being an international meeting of artists, (which may sound very bohemian and even ""cool"") is a meeting between artists from the most disparate places on the planet, people with a particular worldview of life derived from the culture they come from. SIANOJA is a totum revolutum of cultural exchange, where creators dialogue, debate and exchange perspectives, with or without a vanishing point, impregnating themselves with new perceptions that are manifested in the following dialogue; the one they maintain with their work during the creation.The first pieces of this magical process take place in SIANOJA. They enrich the cultural heritage, not only of Cantabria, but also of humanity, thanks to the vital experience that, as a result of this exchange, the artists, as ambassadors of their land, take back home to their countries.From this new language, bifurcations are born in the artistic and cultural expressions, bifurcations that contribute new planes for a prism from which, to understand it and to advance, we catalyze our time. The fundraisingWe have divided the crowfunding into four milestones:Milestone I: 9 000 €.The funds raised will be used to cover the costs of staging: materials for the production and reproduction of the works of art, the cache, accommodation (full board accommodation plus extra per diem) of the artists and personalities involved. As well as the elaboration and distribution of the rewards for you, the micro-members, without whom this would not be possible.Milestone II: 12 000 €.Updating and improvement of the web portal www.sianoja.es.com to turn it into a public and virtual museum that will house videography, images and information, both of the artists and of the works of art created during the course of the twenty-one years of SIANOJA's life.The portal will have a news time-line to report on activities related to SIANOJA.Milestone III: 22 000 €.Because for the love of art many things can be done, but not all. Having passed the previous milestone, you help us to cover the costs of the direction, management and communication of the symposium: Management; Advertising graphics; Marketing: online and offline; Expenses derived as per diems and transportation or secondary activities; etc.. It is a lot of work and a lot of people involved.Milestone IV: +22 000 €.These funds will become part of the coffers of the Friends of SIANOJA Association, and will be destined to the continuation and proper functioning of this international symposium in future editions. We will keep you updated on all of them.When the funds raised exceed the amount of funding requested for a milestone, they will go to the next milestone.All funds raised will be used exclusively for the development and realization of SIANOJA. PerksLos Factory (Warhol):Eternal Gratitude on:

We are still raising money in support of legends and krus in the Library during this time of COVID. There have been some very generous recent donations.</p>

<p><strong>COVID Help</strong></p>
<p>We all are struggling in some way, with some people facing tragedy, this is not that. But, if you find yourself in a stable situation and these men are among those that you care for, here is a way to help. The greatest fighters of Muay Thai, after retirement, often don't have financial stability. Many of the Legends we know and love live week-to-week, month-to-month, earning money in unstable circumstances and largely relying on their vast knowledge, skills and experience in Muay Thai by teaching, making appearances at important events, or various other means in the varied and large Muay Thai Community of Thailand. It can be unsure even in the best of times. Now that Thailand has shut down all fights, all public gatherings, all events, and gyms all around the country, many of these greats are without a means to support themselves during this difficult time.</p>
<p><i>If you'd like to see the Legends and Krus who we are supporting, take a look at the <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/posts/muay-thai-uncut-7058199"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Muay Thai Library Table of Contents </a>. This Library Project is supported by patrons and 10% of the net of all patron pledges is distributed every year to the Krus and Legends documented in the Library.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Can Be Done</h3>
<p>All these Legends and Krus are in the <u><strong><a href=""https://www.patreon.com/posts/muay-thai-uncut-7058199"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Muay Thai Library</a></strong></u>, a ""Preserve the Legacy Project"" to preserve the Muay Thai of Thailand and archive the Legends and Greats who carry that knowledge (over 94 hours documented, a full list below). We've always offered the option to send a donation as an additional ""thank you"" to any Kru in the Library, and now is a time when that gratitude is perhaps much more needed and appreciated.  So if you have been inspired or learned something from one of the Krus in the Muay Thai Library you can send a donation to someone who has impacted you or connected to you through the Library.</p>

<p>It's not just monetary support.

But by the donations they have absolutely felt this. It's quite profound.</p>

<p>For the older age group we hope to further refine their creative skills by introducing the craft of screen-printing. This technique is used for creating bold canvases, posters and artwork, but also used to print fabrics and textiles, so it's great for creating all sorts of custom clothing and products. We want to pass on our experience with using the craft and inspire them to create their own projects and pursue their own goals and dreams. </p>
<p><strong>COLLABORATION</strong></p>
<p>As part of our commitment in supporting young people, we will host an annual creative competition together with an artist or organisation to give an exceptional young talent a platform to showcase their work to an international audience. This will further provide them collaborative experience, have fresh perspective and be more empowered.</p>
<p>We also welcome creative <strong>VOLUNTEERS</strong> from all fields to host art workshops in Aida Camp. This can be done remotely or in person. If you are interested in volunteering please get in touch via info@hypepeace.com.</p>

<h3><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></h3>
<p>We understand the importance of supportive engagement for young people. It helps build on important protective factors related to mental health, since it provides opportunities for youth to connect with their peers, build networks, and increase the sense that they're not alone. </p>
<p>This is why we want to launch this Art Facility together with <a href=""https://www.aidacenter.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aida Youth Center</a> so that we can maintain this vital contribution for the Palestinian children and youth. We have seen how such organisations really play an important role.  </p>
<p>Our biggest contribution to date was donating £6,000 to <a href=""https://www.sharek.ps/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sharek Youth Forum</a>. We understood the important work they do and thanks to all our customers who purchased our clothes we were able to raise and donate the money to help expand their Youth Village playground area. Now they can host more young people and enjoy more activities. </p>

<p>Launching this project has some challenges. Palestine is a contentious country, with the growing political crisis we can face restrictions in setting up the facility. Sending materials or donations can be flagged by border control and jeopardise the whole project.</p>

This crowdfunding is to help launch an Art Facility for children and the youths in Aida Youth Center. To teach the craft of screen-printing for the young people to use for their own projects and encourage entrepreneurship. 
 
WHY PALESTINE?
HYPEPEACE has always been vocal about supporting human rights and this region has faced decades of injustice and political crisis.
For many people across the West Bank and Gaza, cultural opportunities are severely limited.
It’s a critical time to support Palestinian youths and more than ever they need our support not just in aid but also help build foundations for their future.
Help us provide creative outlets for children and young adults to use creativity as self-expression, gain skills and bring out their natural creative talent to pursue their own goals and dreams.

HYPEPEACE 'In Solidarity' 
 
ART AS THERAPY
Art and it's creative process relieves stress, encourages creative thinking, boosts self-esteem, and provides a sense of accomplishment.

Whatever the case, the arts play a big role in how humans see and interact with others and the world in general. There are so many reasons why art is important in the world, today and always.
 
WORKSHOP, ACTIVITIES & COLLABORATION

This Art Facility will open and be run by Aida Youth Center (AYC) who is located in Aida Refugee Camp, an area north of the West Bank city of Bethlehem. It was founded in 1968 with the main purpose of serving the local community – especially its children and youth. Today it represents a recreational hub that aims to improve living conditions for camp residents.
LEARNING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
AYC caters to children from the age of 5 and the youth up to the age of 25. We will set up age appropriate creative learning activities that are fun and imaginative for the young people.
For the older age group we hope to further refine their creative skills by introducing the craft of screen-printing. This technique is used for creating bold canvases, posters and artwork, but also used to print fabrics and textiles, so it's great for creating all sorts of custom clothing and products.

WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET
The funds will be allocated foremost to:


Refurbishment for an art classroom. This requires new furnishings such as worktop tables and storage units for materials.
General running cost of the facility for the coming year. We will be training AYC staff specific printing and design techniques.

Should we only raise our goal partially we will focus in providing the general art materials.

<p>Its objective is to help churches organize themselves in new ways that meet the needs of people in the modern world and to create a central place for believers to find new sources of fellowship and services that are crucial to their wellbeing. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A bit about the founder and what ChurchWeave is trying to achieve:</h3>
<p>I grew up in the church, my father was a youth pastor, and where we attended, they tried really hard to create activities that gave kids something to do. And I always wondered why there weren't similar events happening around town on other days of the week, because there are a lot of lonely Christians and non-believers who just want things to do with other human beings.  But as I got older I realized just how hard it is to keep steady volunteers and maintain consistent interest for events within the population of a single congregation. And keeping people updated on what was going on in your church was really difficult to do in this busy world. </p>
<p>ChurchWeave addresses the problems of developing robust communities by putting all of the pieces together that allow people to create events with other like-minded individuals and by allowing anybody to find meaningful activities to participate in through an event calendar that lets users know what is happening at all of the churches in their cities, each day of the week, on an hourly basis. </p>
<p>We believe that this website and app have the potential to breathe new life into the church, enrich the lives of believers, and to truly change the world. Its features are aimed at helping to strengthen communities and acting as another layer of support for vulnerable populations. And its framework is built around fostering love and new relationships between brothers and sisters from different denominations, as well as creating a bridge between Christians and non-Christians at the place where our love for our fellow man meets.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<p>What we need from you is $1 and a share on social media. Because in order to begin building ChurchWeave Lite, which will be a universal event calendar for churches in every city, we need at least $25,000.  But we will also need an additional $300,000 to create a fully functional version of the website we showed in our video. If our campaign is successful, we would also like to fund the completion of our app for both iOS and Android. This means hiring an entire website development team to turn the framework we've built, into a home for users across the globe. We believe that the world needs this technology now and we need your help to make it possible.<br/><br/><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">As a perk for funding this campaign, instead of offering you merchandise like stickers or swag, or a gadget that you will eventually throw away we are bringing you a website and app that will continue to give to you and the rest of the world for many years to come. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">BUT IN ADDITION!!!  </span></strong></p>
<p>We<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> will be giving you back the proceeds from the money you give us after we launch our website, to support projects you believe in!

<p><br/><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">If you have gotten this far, maybe look around Indiegogo and see the things that are being funded, and ask yourself if this technology could have more impact on the world than a new type of earphones, shoes, or some other fancy gadget, because only people like you can help to bring this to life. </span>The more that we all contribute, the more we all get back. There are over 400,000 churches in America alone!!! And 2.3 billion Christians worldwide!!!!  If each of us pitch in a small amount, we can reach our goal and create an entirely new kind of community.</p>
<p>Even if you can't help us fund it, there are tons of ways to assist us. The easiest thing you can do is to share this on social media. If you work in ministry, you could share our video during your weekly bulletin or as a pastor you could share this in your newsletter, with other leaders in your denomination, or with other sister churches that you are involved within your city.  Whatever you can do, we are grateful for your help.<br/><br/>We can't wait to see how this all comes together over the duration of the campaign. I will personally be traveling around the United States and stopping at churches and Christian universities along the way to share this idea with as many people as I can.

<h2><strong>We present Nacer Matsigenka!</strong></h2>

<p>We are proud to present  Nacer Matsigenka / Omechotaganira Matsigenkaku which brings to the world our work documenting and making visible the knowledge of the Matsigenka community of Camisea through the voices of women. Nacer Matsigenka is a bilingual (Spanish/Matsigenka) book illustrated by Yaquemilsa Matiashi Vicente about the practices and beliefs related to childbirth in Camisea, an indigenous Matsigenka community of the Lower Urubamba, in the Peruvian Amazon.</p>
<p>The creators of the book are Yaquemilsa Matiashi Vicente, a young Matsigenka mother and artist who is currently a student of environmental engineering at UPEU-Tarapoto and Brenda Araujo Salas, who researches traditional knowledge focused on women's health. </p>
<p>The aim in the creation of this book is to honor the knowledge of the Matsigenka people. With the money from this campaign we will be presenting the women of Camisea who lent their voices to this project a copy of the book. We will also be presenting the book to women in 3 other communities around the Lower Urubamba (Ticumpinia, Timpia and Shivankoreni) with the aim of creating dialogues about their traditional birth practices and their rights as indigenous women to receive health care that respects these practices.</p>
<p>We think it is critical that this information is visible, and we hope this book can help support the continued passing of this knowledge down through the generations. We believe these traditional practices and knowledge make us stronger as people and can help revitalize indigenous Amazon identity. Having a strong identity and pride as indigenous Matsigenka people is important in the defense of ourselves and our territories.</p>

<p>The printing will be done in the second half of June 2018 and we are planning to travel to the Lower Urubamba to present the books to the communities in early July. We will begin in Camisea and travel to the other three communities explaining the process of creating these books.</p>
<p>During these presentations we will also be holding workshops in Matsigenka and Spanish ​​on reproductive health and the rights of indigenous women to give birth in the way they choose and to receive culturally responsive health care. </p>
<p>We are also planning to deliver PDF versions of Nacer Matsigenka/Omechotaganira Matsigenkaku to the nurses and OBGYNs who work with women in these communities.  We are excited to use this book to strengthen conversations between these health workers and community leaders about what culturally responsive healthcare can look like.</p>
<p>Supporting with $10 will get you a PDF version of Nacer Matsigenka/Omechotaganira Matsigenkaku.  We are excited for you to see the beautiful illustrations by Yaquemilsa!</p>
<p>There will also be postcards and posters for sale depicting 5 stages of women’s health and childbirth: the first menstruation, pregnancy, delivery, care of the newborn and care of the baby as it grows.  The postcards will feature illustrations and a brief explanation in Matsigenka and Spanish.  </p>

<h2>What is happening and why it is so urgent to value cultural practices</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522799506/c9gapvyrezq43wdtz3zt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We believe that strengthening identity from birth is very important, especially now that there is more and more of a foreign presence in the indigenous communities in the Amazon. 30 years ago there were not many outsiders in the region, but since 1980, oil and gas extraction have started taking place and more and more outside workers and merchants have been arriving. In the last 30 years there has also been a more consistent presence of the Peruvian government, which has created public projects such as health clinics and schools.</p>
<p>It is critical these health clinics and schools provide culturally appropriate and responsive services, but this is usually not the case.  A clear example: in schools in the Lower Urubamba children often want to stop speaking in their mother tongue.  This was not found before public schools entered the region and reflects a deep need to create similar dialogues around respectful, culturally responsive education.</p>
<p>With healthcare, it is now considered more “civilized” to give birth in one of the public health clinics.  Traditional midwives and other health workers in the community are gradually giving up their work. As they stop, community members are losing traditional practices and remedies to keep themselves healthy and balanced within themselves and with their environment.  While there are some clinic personnel who are respectful and want to learn and provide culturally responsive care, they are not the majority.</p>
<p>We believe that these communities deserve knowledge about their rights as indigenous people and specifically as indigenous women. We believe that the solutions to providing this culturally relevant health care, health care with dignity, will not only come from the Ministry of Health, the Peruvian government, but the communities themselves. And we believe that strengthening cultural practices around health is an important way to strengthen cultural identity as a whole.</p>
<p>Nacer Matsigenka is the first step that we have developed to revitalize Matsigenka indigenous identity in the Lower Urubamba. We have the support of the leadership of Camisea and are looking forward to use this work to continue to strengthen cultural identity with the Matsigenka youth of Camisea.</p>

<h3>What</h3>
<p>The Artist in Residence Program at Free Cycles is a new initiative to connect Artists with the Missoula community through the love of cycling. Artists are invited through a public art call, and when selected may spend up to one month in the warehouse studio. Here Artists are granted the time, space, materials, and equipment to create. Artist participants are able to source materials from the thousands of donated bikes in stock on the Free Cycles property, as well as donated and reclaimed construction materials from local materials giving partner Home ReSource. Upon completion of their residency Artists in Residence are asked to provide one workshop day to staff and volunteers, one workshop day to be offered free of charge to the public, and one work of art suitable for installation on the Free Cycles 2 acre property. In its initial year the program is set to offer residencies to four local artists. At this point in the fundraising stipends will not be able to be offered without your help! The program’s goal is to be able to offer Artists fair compensation for their educational work and provide a stipend for their time in residence with hopes that future funding can grow these amounts to seek Artists in all stages of their careers.</p>
<h3>WHY?!</h3>
<p>The planning process for this project has been happening informally for many years. By offering a community space, that encourages citizen interaction, Artists are attracted organically out of their love for creative process. For more than two decades Artists have been creating with materials from Free Cycles, often in their own shops but sometimes on site. With the recent purchase of the two-acre property and 28,000-square feet of building space this year has provided opportunity to formalize our Artist oriented programming and increase our community workshop offerings.  This program will ensure the future of the Free Cycles warehouse as a permanent part of the Free Cycles Community Bike Shop’s engagement at a pivotal time in the property’s future. </p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
</div><div><p>MIST, the Missoula Institute for Sustainable Transportation, is a citizen-based non-profit organization in Missoula, Montana. We have a strong focus on making walking, bicycling, and public transit more complete, accessible and enjoyable. We work to create a system of movement that is safe, equitable and environmentally sound. Four programs work towards these goals, of which Free Cycles Community Bicycle Shop is one. Free Cycles Community Bicycle Shopseeks to create a healthy community through a wide range of strategies. The goal of Free Cycles is to help Missoula, Montana transition to a more sustainable transportation system while simultaneously setting a strong example for other places. Through our programs we hope to help individuals we work with to be active stewards of the community with an emphasis on social and environmental justice. We work towards this mission through education, empowerment, and engagement. Our education programs strive to give people the knowledge to maintain their bicycle independently, use it safely, and eventually share their skills with others. By increasing the accessibility of human powered transportation, we seek to directly empower individuals from all walks of life with the ability to move themselves. Our projects focus on community engagement to facilitate a sense of collective responsibility, a strong sense of place, and human connectivity. Free cycles has had approximately 200,000 total participants to date. There have been 38,000 bikes donated since 1996 of which about half gone out as free bikes while about one quarter have beenrecycled and one quarter have been repurposed.

Every member of the committee loves the genre, is active in Steampunk events, and has wanted  to do a convention event for the community for a long time.</div><div> </div><div>We need your help and commitment to the event.  Producing even a small convention is expensive, perhaps more so than most people realize. </div><div> </div><div>Here's a breakdown of most of the expense categories:</div><div>Building Rental - 2 days with multiple rooms and set-up and breakdown hours. Minimum $4,000</div><div>Event Insurance  $300-$400</div><div>Required Security Staff $60 per hour</div><div>Website  $200</div><div>Promotional Materials  $700 (includes promotional merchandise)</div><div>Payment for Entertainers  $1000</div><div>Food, Beverages, etc. for The Afternoon tea.  $400</div><div> </div><div>As you can see, we're not trying to finance the whole event through this campaign, but if we get it fully funded it is a huge part of the amount we need, plus we know we'll see a lot of people coming out to join us.</div><div> </div><div><strong> What You Get</strong></div><div> </div><div>Almost every one of our perks includes some form of ticket to the convention. In addition you'll get some fun swag that will be an indicator that you are one of our base supporters.  We have done our best to keep our ticket prices reasonable, and we can do that because every single person working on this event is volunteering their time, energy, and in some cases donating goods, furnishings, decor pieces and more to make this a delightful time for all.</div><div> </div><div>Perks are picked up at the event when you check in.</div><div> </div><div>You'll get the chance to interact with other Steampunk enthusiasts in a friendly environment, make new friends, exchange information and ideas, play games,  attend panels, and be involved in activities of your choice. You can shop with Steampunk-specific vendors, and partake of on-site food from our food vendors.</div><div> </div><div>
<p>We haven't had a Steampunk-specific convention in Utah for some time. The planning committee agreed that we'd stage one this year. All the members of the committee have extensive experience in organizing and producing events, so the depth of knowledge and expertise is impressive. </p>
<p>It's difficult for the community to associate and grow without opportunities like this event. We're starting somewhat small, but we are hopeful that with a successful convention this year we can grow year by year.</p>

</div></div>","The Utah Steampunk Society Community Planning Group is producing the Utah Steampunk Society Steaming cOn in August on the 16th and 17th. Every member of the committee loves the genre, is active in Steampunk events, and has wanted  to do a convention event for the community for a long time. We need your help and commitment to the event.  Producing even a small convention is expensive, perhaps more so than most people realize.  Here's a breakdown of most of the expense categories:Building Rental - 2 days with multiple rooms and set-up and breakdown hours. Minimum $4,000Event Insurance  $300-$400Required Security Staff $60 per hourWebsite  $200Promotional Materials  $700 (includes promotional merchandise)Payment for Entertainers  $1000Food, Beverages, etc. for The Afternoon tea.  $400 As you can see, we're not trying to finance the whole event through this campaign, but if we get it fully funded it is a huge part of the amount we need, plus we know we'll see a lot of people coming out to join us.  What You Get Almost every one of our perks includes some form of ticket to the convention. In addition you'll get some fun swag that will be an indicator that you are one of our base supporters.  We have done our best to keep our ticket prices reasonable, and we can do that because every single person working on this event is volunteering their time, energy, and in some cases donating goods, furnishings, decor pieces and more to make this a delightful time for all. Perks are picked up at the event when you check in. You'll get the chance to interact with other Steampunk enthusiasts in a friendly environment, make new friends, exchange information and ideas, play games,  attend panels, and be involved in activities of your choice. You can shop with Steampunk-specific vendors, and partake of on-site food from our food vendors. 
We haven't had a Steampunk-specific convention in Utah for some time. The planning committee agreed that we'd stage one this year. All the members of the committee have extensive experience in organizing and producing events, so the depth of knowledge and expertise is impressive. 
It's difficult for the community to associate and grow without opportunities like this event. We're starting somewhat small, but we are hopeful that with a successful convention this year we can grow year by year.
The RisksWe can build it, but we can't make you attend. That's the gamble we are making;  that there are enough interested people in our community who will attend so that we at least break even.  If we were to make a profit that profit would go towards Steampunk activities, including planning for next year's convention. We chose not to do a Kickstarter because we intend to go through with this event regardless.

<h3>How this came to be</h3>
<p>My name is Tucker Brennan. As far back as I can remember, I was obsessed with film and home video. I have manifested this passion on social media. I gained some notoriety on Vine, but I have relocated since their demise to Instagram (@ogvhs). For years, I have had the dream of making a career out of my passion. Now, it can become a reality.</p>
<p>A generation ago, director Kevin Smith introduced us to the existential hell of menial retail jobs in his seminal independent comedy <i>Clerks</i>. Quick Stop, the convenience store that has spanned Smith’s View Askewniverse in subsequent decades, still stands. The neighbor business, RST Video, has long since closed. In fact, in Smith’s forthcoming <i>Jay and Silent Bob Reboot</i>, the mecca of hit movies like <i>Happy Scrappy Hero Pup</i>, <i>The Best of Both Worlds</i>, and <i>Navy Seals </i>has been replaced with a Redbox.</p>
<p>Now, our vision is to resurrect RST Video as it was in its heyday, and then some. This not just a nostalgia haven, or a recreation of a cinematic landmark.</p>
<p>By reopening the store, we plan to offer a tangible experience that has dwindled in the wake of streaming and, yes, Redbox. Our hope is that RST Video can usher the video store into the era of social media. We plan to create an experience that caters to everyone’s niche. Entertainment is not uniform the way it was in the golden age of video stores.</p>
<p>That is why we intend for RST Video to be a boutique store that caters to as many niches as possible within our space, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home video sales and rentals on DVD, Blu-ray, 4K Blu-ray, and of course, VHS and other retro formats, <strong>including the original RST Video stock</strong>;</li>
<li>An impeccable selection of video game consoles and games, also available for sale and rent;</li>
<li>Antique electronics, from VCR’s to turntables;</li>
<li>
<strong><i>And much more</i></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are planning to open the doors to a fresh, unique destination with the intention of keeping video store culture and physical media alive. This, my friends, is the pop-culture paradise we have dreamed of for 25 years.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>·      While much of the store and stock have been untouched, there is a great deal of work to be done to renovate the store. We need to replace shelving, install a modern rental system, restore the signage, and promote the new RST Video!</p>
<p>·      In exchange for your support, we have a lot of merchandise and experiences available, including RST-branded clothing, invites to the grand opening, swag boxes, and more!</p>
<p>·      We have an agreement in place with the owners. RST Video WILL open. However, if we fail, any unused funds will be donated to Family Promise of Monmouth County Food and Shelter Services in Middletown, NJ.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If you are not a fan of Kevin Smith or do not get the appeal of a video store in 2019, rest assured that this we plan to stand alone in practice, if not spirit.</p>
<ul>
<li>We understand Smith’s fans.</li>
<li>We know how much we value the significance of RST video, as well as the looming shadow of video store nostalgia.</li>
<li>VHS is making a comeback! Even if you do not plan to buy or rent tapes, there will be plenty more to gravitate you.</li>

<p>English version: <a href=""https://thegiftofwiracochablog.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://thegiftofwiracochablog.wordpress.com</a></p>
<p>INTRODUZIONE<br/><br/>La ricerca di una terza via che coniughi arte e scienza è l'impulso che nel 2004 ha portato alla creazione di VID art|science. Grazie alla cura ed alla passione del Prof. Carlo Ventura (cardiologo e biologo molecolare esperto in medicina rigenerativa e vibrazionale) e di Julia von Stietencron (artista tessile e stilista) negli anni si è formato un gruppo di ricercatori ed artisti appartenenti a diversi ambiti e nazionalità. <br/><br/>Nel novembre 2016 un evento decisivo: Cell Melodies, festival di 3 giorni svoltosi a Bologna, nel Teatro San Leonardo (in collaborazione con Angelica Festival) che ha avuto l'onore di ospitare vari artisti fra i quali Milford Graves, Alessandro Bergonzoni e Gianni Gebbia in esperimenti live diretti a colture viventi di cellule staminali informate dai ritmi, dalle parole e dai suoni prodotti sulla scena. La risposta di queste cellule dall'alto potere di metamorfosi, presenti in gran numero nei nostri corpi, è stata commovente: il loro profilo vibrazionale si è intensificato a tal punto da mostrare agli sguardi raccolti nel teatro gremito una danza di fotoni massimamente coerente.<br/><br/>Sono ormai molte le evidenze scientifiche che testimoniano della potenza rigenerativa insita nei suoni, nel gesto, nella forma e nei colori e che riconfigurano l'arte nella sua funzione rituale di cura e ri-connessione con le energie ed i cicli della Natura.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Su queste basi VID art|science ha concepito “Il dono de Wiracocha”, progetto di ricerca nell'ambito del Teatro Rituale. Tale formula designa un dispositivo culturale che attraverso l'atto performativo evoca ed incarna l'intensità delle antiche narrazioni mitiche e dei rituali ad esse connesse, armonizzandole con le meraviglie che le avanguardie della scienza tornano a dischiudere.<br/><br/>In questo viaggio di circa 45 giorni nelle magiche terre del Perù avremo come guide uomini e donne depositari di antiche tradizioni, condividendo la quotidianità e partecipando alle loro cerimonie. Ci ispireremo alla visione del mondo ed alle pratiche che costantemente rinnovano un fecondo ed equilibrato rapporto simbiotico con le forze della Natura. <br/><br/>Questo percorso iniziatico fornirà il materiale per un film documentario che vede alla regia Stefano Croci, autore e co-fondatore di Caucaso Factory. Quest'opera tenterà di cogliere le fasi salienti del viaggio rielaborandole in una narrazione che affini e potenzi la volontà mitopoietica dell'intero progetto. <br/><br/>Al ritorno, dopo una necessaria fase di re-integrazione e trasfigurazione dell'esperienza, VID art|science realizzerà uno spettacolo di Teatro Rituale a cura di Yuri Dini, il cui debutto è previsto nella seconda edizione di Cell Melodies (novembre 2017 - Teatro San Leonardo, Bologna).<br/><br/>In questa occasione, grazie all'equipe del Prof. Carlo Ventura, ci serviremo di una tecnica chiamata hyperspectral imaging, capace di cogliere il profilo vibrazionale delle cellule degli spettatori e dei performers. Questo ci permetterà di collezionare una serie di evidenze scientifiche dei mutamenti generati attraverso l'atto performativo. Queste saranno poi confrontate con i dati analogamente raccolti nelle cerimonie e nei rituali ai quali prenderemo parte durante il viaggio in Perù.<br/><br/>Il presente dialogo fra arte e scienza ci permetterà altresì di porre le basi per un'analisi comparata fra rito e teatro, nel tentativo di riconferire a quest'ultimo un ruolo decisivo nella crisi culturale che attraversa la nostra società.<br/><br/>Questo è il nostro contributo al movimento che da ogni angolo della Terra crea e lotta per un'età più bella. Un viaggio in Perù, alle radici della Cura, riportando nel “villaggio natio” un messaggio di speranza ed una serie di conoscenze e pratiche a disposizione di quanti vogliano unirsi a noi nel cammino. <br/><br/>Vogliamo realizzare un film documentario del viaggio ed uno spettacolo che traduca e veicoli le antiche tecniche di cura che in quei luoghi vengono custodite e tramandate da millenni. <br/><br/>Il 2 giugno partiremo, in ogni caso, ma solo con il tuo sostegno riusciremo a trasformare il viaggio in opera, a far sposare Arte e Cura e condividerne i frutti.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>CRONOPROGRAMMA<br/><br/>・2 giugno 2017 - Volo Bologna-Lima<br/><br/>・3-5 giugno - Lima<br/><br/>Museo Nazionale di archeologia, antropologia e storia del Perù. Incontro con alcuni curanderos che nel tessuto urbano hanno sviluppato sistemi di cure sincretici, unendo saperi tradizionali a moderne discipline olistiche, in un costante dialogo con la medicina allopatica<br/>Visita a mercati cittadini che offrono centinaia di rimedi naturali disponibili anche per la stragrande maggioranza della popolazione che non ha accesso alle cure “ufficiali”<br/><br/>・6-7 giugno - Ica, Nasca<br/><br/>Museo Cabrera.

INTRODUZIONELa ricerca di una terza via che coniughi arte e scienza è l'impulso che nel 2004 ha portato alla creazione di VID art|science. Grazie alla cura ed alla passione del Prof. Carlo Ventura (cardiologo e biologo molecolare esperto in medicina rigenerativa e vibrazionale) e di Julia von Stietencron (artista tessile e stilista) negli anni si è formato un gruppo di ricercatori ed artisti appartenenti a diversi ambiti e nazionalità. Nel novembre 2016 un evento decisivo: Cell Melodies, festival di 3 giorni svoltosi a Bologna, nel Teatro San Leonardo (in collaborazione con Angelica Festival) che ha avuto l'onore di ospitare vari artisti fra i quali Milford Graves, Alessandro Bergonzoni e Gianni Gebbia in esperimenti live diretti a colture viventi di cellule staminali informate dai ritmi, dalle parole e dai suoni prodotti sulla scena. La risposta di queste cellule dall'alto potere di metamorfosi, presenti in gran numero nei nostri corpi, è stata commovente: il loro profilo vibrazionale si è intensificato a tal punto da mostrare agli sguardi raccolti nel teatro gremito una danza di fotoni massimamente coerente.Sono ormai molte le evidenze scientifiche che testimoniano della potenza rigenerativa insita nei suoni, nel gesto, nella forma e nei colori e che riconfigurano l'arte nella sua funzione rituale di cura e ri-connessione con le energie ed i cicli della Natura.---ABSTRACTSu queste basi VID art|science ha concepito “Il dono de Wiracocha”, progetto di ricerca nell'ambito del Teatro Rituale. Tale formula designa un dispositivo culturale che attraverso l'atto performativo evoca ed incarna l'intensità delle antiche narrazioni mitiche e dei rituali ad esse connesse, armonizzandole con le meraviglie che le avanguardie della scienza tornano a dischiudere.In questo viaggio di circa 45 giorni nelle magiche terre del Perù avremo come guide uomini e donne depositari di antiche tradizioni, condividendo la quotidianità e partecipando alle loro cerimonie. Ci ispireremo alla visione del mondo ed alle pratiche che costantemente rinnovano un fecondo ed equilibrato rapporto simbiotico con le forze della Natura. Questo percorso iniziatico fornirà il materiale per un film documentario che vede alla regia Stefano Croci, autore e co-fondatore di Caucaso Factory. Quest'opera tenterà di cogliere le fasi salienti del viaggio rielaborandole in una narrazione che affini e potenzi la volontà mitopoietica dell'intero progetto. Al ritorno, dopo una necessaria fase di re-integrazione e trasfigurazione dell'esperienza, VID art|science realizzerà uno spettacolo di Teatro Rituale a cura di Yuri Dini, il cui debutto è previsto nella seconda edizione di Cell Melodies (novembre 2017 - Teatro San Leonardo, Bologna).In questa occasione, grazie all'equipe del Prof. Carlo Ventura, ci serviremo di una tecnica chiamata hyperspectral imaging, capace di cogliere il profilo vibrazionale delle cellule degli spettatori e dei performers. Questo ci permetterà di collezionare una serie di evidenze scientifiche dei mutamenti generati attraverso l'atto performativo. Queste saranno poi confrontate con i dati analogamente raccolti nelle cerimonie e nei rituali ai quali prenderemo parte durante il viaggio in Perù.Il presente dialogo fra arte e scienza ci permetterà altresì di porre le basi per un'analisi comparata fra rito e teatro, nel tentativo di riconferire a quest'ultimo un ruolo decisivo nella crisi culturale che attraversa la nostra società.Questo è il nostro contributo al movimento che da ogni angolo della Terra crea e lotta per un'età più bella. Un viaggio in Perù, alle radici della Cura, riportando nel “villaggio natio” un messaggio di speranza ed una serie di conoscenze e pratiche a disposizione di quanti vogliano unirsi a noi nel cammino. Vogliamo realizzare un film documentario del viaggio ed uno spettacolo che traduca e veicoli le antiche tecniche di cura che in quei luoghi vengono custodite e tramandate da millenni. Il 2 giugno partiremo, in ogni caso, ma solo con il tuo sostegno riusciremo a trasformare il viaggio in opera, a far sposare Arte e Cura e condividerne i frutti.---CRONOPROGRAMMA・2 giugno 2017 - Volo Bologna-Lima・3-5 giugno - LimaMuseo Nazionale di archeologia, antropologia e storia del Perù.

<h3>“Every artist knows that he is engaged in an encounter with infinity, and that work done with heart and hand is ultimately expression of Life Itself.”</h3>
<p>– Bernard Leach</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>HI THERE, I’M EMMA,</h3>
<p>Some may know me as a photographer, others as a ceramicist but more importantly, creativity has been an integral part of my being for as long as I can remember. It is the fuel to my fire, the language that allows me to go beyond my self, explore liberally and fulfil my deepest curiosities.</p>
<p>Coupled with a hunger for authenticity, community and engagement, I have long found solace in collaboration with other creative minds and relish what comes to the surface when we explore new territory together from this place of intuitive connection. In a society where, if we’re honest, distractions from this sincere exploration are plentiful, I truly believe that the most promising way forward is as a collective.</p>
<p>A number of fateful twist and turns have led me to Bali, and I gotta say, it’s true what they tell ya – the gods really do work their magic here. Inspired by the abundance of rich creative tradition and nourished by the wholesome creative and spiritual lifestyle, I have found a space where I believe I may put these values into practice and serve to make a difference.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THE JOURNEY OF MAKASI</h3>
<p>The term ‘makasi’ in Indonesian language comes from terima kasih. ‘Terima’ meaning to receive and ‘kasih’, to give. Together the two mean thank you.</p>
<p>The universal language of creativity unites the Makasi community and enables us to engage liberally with ourselves, our environment, our traditions, and within our diverse collective. This intimacy is passed onto our audience through our unique range of pieces that are designed with intention to accompany and bring presence to the quiet and abundant moments of our day to day.</p>
<p>It seems only appropriate to say Makasi and show gratitude for this enriching exchange of both giving and receiving.</p>
<p>Initially, working alongside a curated selection of traditional artisans in Indonesia, Makasi will provide a contemporary platform for them to tell their story and share their treasured traditions with an international audience. Collaboratively, we will design and curate a selection of intentionally made pieces intended to accompany everyday rituals with gratitude and simplicity. The Makasi blog and online store will feature this unique range - reaching, educating and growing a socially and ecologically conscious audience who choose to consume with transparency and intention.</p>
<p>Seeking to create new opportunities and progressive ideas amongst our community, collaboration will be encouraged between various mediums and generations, providing the platform for a diverse range of creative minds to engage and explore. Simplicity will be cherished throughout this process as we endeavour to provide a collection that offers a simple, timeless, functional aesthetic and allows the organic and intuitive allure of natural materials and the makers hand to be celebrated.</p>
<p>Our online content will strive to represent our artists in an authentic and engaging manner. Photographic documentation of the artists within their creative spaces alongside accompanying articles and regular topical blog posts will provide our audience with an intimate insight and allow them to be captivated by the creative process.</p>
<p>Rich in crafts, culture, tradition, beautiful natural materials and open to opportunities, Indonesia provides a fantastic platform for the initiation of the Makasi community. Following this establishment and with a reputable reputation behind us, our diversity will extend to cross-cultural collaboration as we unite East and West with an invitation to contemporary and traditional artists from New Zealand, Australia and throughout South East Asia to collaborate and join the collective. As the community extends and diversifies with representation from various cultural backgrounds, Makasi becomes a unifying centre and we are able to explore wholesome, progressive ideas amongst a supportive world-wide network, enriching the lives of artists and consumers worldwide.</p>
<p>Once the community has been established online and is self-sufficient, Makasi provides the platform to launch further projects and create more opportunities.</p>
<p>The physical home of the community will exist as a creative sanctuary. This space will house a gallery with rotating exhibitions and a retail area featuring the Makasi range. A collaborative work / event space will offer the opportunity for further community engagement. New Zealand or Indonesia will provide a home to the first Makasi hub, with the potential to expand worldwide.</p>
<p>Further initiatives could also include world-wide pop-up markets, workshops, creative exchanges, residencies or mentoring programs. As the community connects, the opportunities really are infinite. Collectively – our presence is stronger, as we strive to make the creative lifestyle forever more relevant in our contemporary society.</p>
<p>With much of the initial stages well underway including consideration of site design, branding, proposals and contracts, policies, payment procedures, artist recruitment and design philosophy, the platform for the Makasi community is already well established and the funding received will provide the support needed to launch this vision into reality. Alongside my own creative practice, my background in community work and as a gallery coordinator has provided me with a solid foundational skill set for the challenges that may arise as Makasi unfolds. I feel well equipped for this endeavor alongside a team of incredible artisans, designers, advisers and marketing experts. As we stand by these authentic intentions, keep the passion flame burning and remain open to organic evolution I am eager to watch this journey unfold.</p>

I am a multimedia artist and healer based in Orlando, FL. I've always been interested in exploring a variety of creative endeavors - painting, drawing, event organizing, reiki, sewing, dancing, interior design. I used to get frustrated at myself for not being able to choose just one thing - until I realized that having immersed myself in so many different mediums presents a unique opportunity to blend them into what has become my current passion project: Immerge.</p><p>I deeply enjoy the process of co-creation and am excited to bring to life this vision of community healing through artistic expression. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609908089/juqciybkm7lrpzpub1vf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Performances and art by:  Daniel Koenigkann, NUYA, AHHA Dance, PMFL Productions, Light Flora, Summer Thyme, &amp; many more.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610513362/prqmkpkzmi36tehikokg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Venue provided by Living Vitalitea Kombucha</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610513455/otebjd5tvqtlowcoh7pn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Birth of the Project</strong></p><p>Immerge began as a longing for a space that felt both nurturing and expansive, a space layered with art and garnished with a sense of belonging. This longing was the seed that is now beginning to sprout. </p><p>This seed has been germinating in a bed of exploration. For the past several years I've been immersing myself in the arts; exploring the process of creation both within myself and within the community. It began with a love of painting and a recognition of the healing power of art. Soon I integrated into my repertoire theater, dance, illustration, sculpting, reiki, furniture design, and music. At the core of why I create is a sense of aliveness that breeds transformation and I want to share that with others. </p><p>With creativity at the core and a lot of experience managing teams throughout high school, college, and work, I feel adequately prepared and excited to gather all of my experience and passion into one space. </p><p><strong>What Will Happen There?</strong></p><p>The Living Vitalitea Brewery will be transformed for three days into a completely immersive art experience. Guests will be guided through a creative journey from the outside world into the nurturing womb of creation. There will be curated live musical performances, dance performances, a dance party, and a gallery space that will all be blended together into one cohesive experience. </p><p>Immerge is a roughly three hour event, taking place April 16,17, and 18. Tickets are limited to just 30 people per night and guests will be asked to arrive on time an stay through the duration of the event to create an opportunity for intimacy and intention.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters</strong></p><p>It's been a wild year for many of us.  With so much outside of our control it can be difficult to feel like we have any place here. Immerge challenges that assumption by creating a space that allows us to connect to one another, to ourselves, and to our divinity. It is both an art space and a healing space that with your support we can bring to life. </p><p><b>How Your Contribution Will Help</b></p><p>This is a grassroots event and we're going to need a lot of support from our community to pull it off. We already have the commitments of local artists and businesses. Now we just need the funds to help us with creating installations, compensating the performers, creating merch, and ideally a little bit extra to help us save for our next event. </p><p>Our total fundraising goal is $4200. Ticket sales will account for about $2500 of this goal, leaving us with $1700 left to raise. Our IndieGogo goal is $1900 to account for their cut and processing fees. </p><p>This money will first be allocated to materials needed for installations. These will play a big part in creating the atmosphere for the event and will create little wonderlands for guests to explore. We plan to use primarily found, donated, and recycled materials, keeping our costs pretty low and exhibiting a little kindness to Mother Earth in the process. Mostly this will be for things like paint and used fabrics. </p><p>The remaining funds will be divided proportionally between performers. Any extra amount raised over the goal will go into a fund for future projects and events!</p><p>Please note that tickets to Immerge will not be sold through IndieGogo. If you plan to attend our event (and we hope that you do!) tickets will not be included in your donation.

<p>According to our history, we're all descendants of immigrants to Canada except for our aboriginal cousins.  A lot of us grew up learning our family history through the passing down of ""griot"" history, heritage and genealogy.  </p>
<p>That history made you and your ancestry strong to prosper in a new land. Our  communities intertwined to progress our country.  Our offspring, knowledgeable about their legacy, learned little of their ""Canadian"" history.  Some of us learned little of our culture through fear of antagonism, familial secrecy, indoctrination of ""political"" history, and lack of education.</p>
<p>We now have an opportunity to tell our story through the integration of ""true"" Black Canadian history into the educational system and increase awareness through leadership, educators, families and friends, towards appreciating the values of inclusivity, collaboration and knowledge of our <strong>""Community, Roots &amp; Cultures""</strong>.</p>
<p>The 2017 venue includes:</p>
<p>A <strong>HBHAS Freedom Festival</strong> <strong>Speakers' Forum</strong> on <strong>August 4th</strong>, at the <strong>Royal Botanical Gardens</strong>, Burlington, which includes historical, genealogical, and cultural speakers, music and spoken word plus a marketplace of historical book suppliers and community/cultural vendors. </p>
<p>On <strong>Saturday August 5</strong> there will be a <strong>HBHAS Halton Freedom Festival Celebration</strong> at <strong>Spencer Smith Park</strong>, inclusive of exquisite musical and dance acts, youth and children's events, artistic/musical and historical forums, and an extensive marketplace of cultural cuisine, community and cultural association partners and, genealogists and historians/authors and cultural contributors. </p>
<p>We will also be presenting a <strong>HBHAS Canadian Black Art Exhibit</strong> to take place at <strong>Halton Hills Cultural Centre</strong> in <strong>Georgetown, Ontario</strong> from <strong>August 21 to September 2nd</strong> incorporating Artists'  and Speaker presentations. </p>
<p>All venues are open and promoted to the public.  We know this festival can grow to the size of the Burlington Ribfest and Sound of Music events and enhance and augment Halton's community and cultural prestige and status.  We are also collaborating with a number of community partners in presentations and workshops within schools and community centers throughout the year.</p>
<p>Towards this journey, we are seeking $20,000 by June 1st, 2017, to support our inaugural multicultural Halton Freedom Festival.  Having been incorporated in affiliation with the Ontario Historical Society in August 2016, the HBHAS is not eligible for the 1 year incorporation status required to obtain grants for 2017 even though the organization has been in existence since 2005 as a committee.  It is for this reason that we are requesting a partnership with interested individuals, companies and associations towards financially supporting the Halton Freedom Festival.  We would also like to offer free admission to our Halton Freedom Festival as almost all festivals at Spencer Smith Park are free and open to the public. Your support is appreciated and will be identified, with your permission, throughout our marketing and venue programs. </p>
<p>Halton Population Statistics</p>
<ul>
<li>In Halton-Peel, there is significantly faster population growth among immigrant and visible minority communities compared to the overall population.</li>
<li>Between 2001 and 2006, the region’s visible minority population increased by 76%. This was about four and half times faster than the 17% growth rate of the total population. In fact, the growth rates of the visible minority population in each of the area municipalities surpass those of the total population.</li>
<li>The Town of Milton, the fastest-growing community in Canada, experienced a 780% increase of its visible minority population. It is now home to over 9,000 individuals of that population sub-group.</li>
<li>The visible minority population is also younger. For example, over one-quarter (26%) of the population is under the age of 15 as compared to 21% for the non visible minority population.</li>

<p>An increasing number of individuals in our communities are appreciating true, and often hidden, Canadian history.  Through appreciating that our Emancipation was progressed by multi cultures and that we, individually, are often derivatives of multi cultures; have experienced similar prejudices and enslavement within our own cultures; desire the best that life can offer; and will gain in personal development when self knowledge is learned, we realize, as many proponents of inclusivity and acceptance state, that cultural education is a mandate that will alleviate our prejudices and promote progression.</p>

<p>Knowing one's history and culture is knowing one's self.  This knowledge will give you strength, focus, inspiration, ambition and progress.  The earlier we can learn about ourselves, our heritage, our culture and our people, and that of others, the more we will appreciate how the home, community and individual can best progress.  </p>

</div></div>","According to our history, we're all descendants of immigrants to Canada except for our aboriginal cousins.  A lot of us grew up learning our family history through the passing down of ""griot"" history, heritage and genealogy.  
That history made you and your ancestry strong to prosper in a new land. Our  communities intertwined to progress our country.  Our offspring, knowledgeable about their legacy, learned little of their ""Canadian"" history.  Some of us learned little of our culture through fear of antagonism, familial secrecy, indoctrination of ""political"" history, and lack of education.
We now have an opportunity to tell our story through the integration of ""true"" Black Canadian history into the educational system and increase awareness through leadership, educators, families and friends, towards appreciating the values of inclusivity, collaboration and knowledge of our ""Community, Roots & Cultures"".
The 2017 venue includes:
A HBHAS Freedom Festival Speakers' Forum on August 4th, at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Burlington, which includes historical, genealogical, and cultural speakers, music and spoken word plus a marketplace of historical book suppliers and community/cultural vendors. 
On Saturday August 5 there will be a HBHAS Halton Freedom Festival Celebration at Spencer Smith Park, inclusive of exquisite musical and dance acts, youth and children's events, artistic/musical and historical forums, and an extensive marketplace of cultural cuisine, community and cultural association partners and, genealogists and historians/authors and cultural contributors. 
We will also be presenting a HBHAS Canadian Black Art Exhibit to take place at Halton Hills Cultural Centre in Georgetown, Ontario from August 21 to September 2nd incorporating Artists'  and Speaker presentations. 
All venues are open and promoted to the public.  We know this festival can grow to the size of the Burlington Ribfest and Sound of Music events and enhance and augment Halton's community and cultural prestige and status.  We are also collaborating with a number of community partners in presentations and workshops within schools and community centers throughout the year.
Towards this journey, we are seeking $20,000 by June 1st, 2017, to support our inaugural multicultural Halton Freedom Festival.  Having been incorporated in affiliation with the Ontario Historical Society in August 2016, the HBHAS is not eligible for the 1 year incorporation status required to obtain grants for 2017 even though the organization has been in existence since 2005 as a committee.  It is for this reason that we are requesting a partnership with interested individuals, companies and associations towards financially supporting the Halton Freedom Festival.  We would also like to offer free admission to our Halton Freedom Festival as almost all festivals at Spencer Smith Park are free and open to the public. Your support is appreciated and will be identified, with your permission, throughout our marketing and venue programs. 
Halton Population Statistics

In Halton-Peel, there is significantly faster population growth among immigrant and visible minority communities compared to the overall population.
Between 2001 and 2006, the region’s visible minority population increased by 76%. This was about four and half times faster than the 17% growth rate of the total population. In fact, the growth rates of the visible minority population in each of the area municipalities surpass those of the total population.
The Town of Milton, the fastest-growing community in Canada, experienced a 780% increase of its visible minority population. It is now home to over 9,000 individuals of that population sub-group.
The visible minority population is also younger. For example, over one-quarter (26%) of the population is under the age of 15 as compared to 21% for the non visible minority population.
The 2012/13 Halton Youth Survey reported that elevated psychological distress is reported by 34% of students. This percentage represents about 341,000 Ontario students.

Every survey is communicating to us that the only direction to take towards a progressive, passionate, prosperous future is through equality, justice, inclusivity, and diversity/cultural/historical education.  The Halton Black History Awareness Committee is focused on promoting self awareness and knowledge through implementation of cultural forums within the educational systems, promoting cultural history through speaker presentations, cultural events culminating in a 2017 Emancipation ""Freedom"" Festival, art/music/literary presentations, and educational/historical and genealogical forums, independently and in collaboration with community partners.

Self awareness, knowledge and confidence/self esteem building
Community and cultural collaboration and education
Prosperity evolving from diversity collaboration and appreciation
Enhancement of our cultural and heritage community and its progressive evolution
Economic influx from tourism increase, cultural cuisine, theatre and art, and
A decline of prejudice, criminality, bullying, and injustices

An increasing number of individuals in our communities are appreciating true, and often hidden, Canadian history.  Through appreciating that our Emancipation was progressed by multi cultures and that we, individually, are often derivatives of multi cultures; have experienced similar prejudices and enslavement within our own cultures; desire the best that life can offer; and will gain in personal development when self knowledge is learned, we realize, as many proponents of inclusivity and acceptance state, that cultural education is a mandate that will alleviate our prejudices and promote progression.
With the growth of visible minorities in Canada, mixed marriages and relationships, cultural and faith integration, and gender equality, our programs and events will definitely enhance one's inquisitiveness, search for self esteem and confidence, and community progress.

I am the founder and, since 2006, have been the co-director of ACOSS - the Armenian Art Centre of Social Studies – an international artist in residence. We are a member of Res Artis Worldwide network of artist residencies and the Microresidence International Network. I have been active in the professional field of contemporary art since graduating from the Academy of Fine Arts in Yerevan in 2002, and I regularly present creative projects and lectures on Armenian culture around the world. In 2010, I was awarded a mobility grant from the Euro Cultural Foundation to research models of artist residencies in the UK. In 2011, I was granted professional development funding from the Open Society Foundation to research artist residencies' management practice in the USA.I am married, and we have four daughters.Our Campaign TeamWe are the ACOSS team, a group of Armenian and international artists committed to supporting and developing contemporary art in Armenia. ACOSS Artist in Residence programThe aim of ACOSS is to support the development of contemporary creativity and to assist local Armenian and international artists and scholars to organize exhibitions, conferences, research projects, seminars, and workshops concerning local art and current political and social situations. Our artist-in-residence program is a platform/meeting point where local and international artists and art professionals connect, develop links, and initiate cross border cultural exchange projects. Since 2006, ACOSS AIR has welcomed over 200 international artists and guests from 40 countries. The ACOSS artist residency program is a long term social practice for me, a piece of my art, where my friends, the community where I am based, and my family are all involved. We meet at an intersection of Armenian hospitality and contemporary art. Here, we regularly collaborate with organizations, internationally to provide cultural exchange opportunities, and locally to develop socially engaged projects supporting social change, particularly in the peripheries and war affected zones of Armenia.Our socially-engaged practiceAs co-director of ACOSS I have initiated and coordinated many social and community development projects in Yerevan, Gyumri, Chambarak, on the Armenian borders, and other places. Projects include: Supporting Integration of Invalids into Society (2012 - 2017), Supporting Education on Border Zones and Supporting Social Integration of Syrian Refugees into New Resettlement Territories. During implementation of such projects we collaborate with many local and international organizations, and several of our visiting artists opt to get involved.Our plan to growAfter 11 amazing years, we are now ready to take the next step in the development of the ACOSS artist residency program. Our current studio is a small space, 38 m/sq, and we want to grow! Finally, after years of trying, last year we were able to purchase a piece of land next to the studio and receive permission from the Yerevan city council to start renovation and expansion of our live/work studios to 200 m/sq - nearly five times more space. Having received permission and approval for our building plan, we've put together a dedicated project team and raised enough money to get the project underway. We started construction last year and built the shell of the new building. However, all funds have been exhausted. With Stage 1 successfully completed, we are now fundraising for Stage 2 to finish all the building work for the permit deadline of May 2018.Since our organization's commencement, we have developed a close international network that has enable ACOSS to thrive in an isolated country. To continue growing, we need your support.What we want to achieveThis is a big project and in my country there is no literarily way to get funding or any kind of sponsorship. We are looking to our international communities to support this initiative and help us reach our goals. Armenia is an isolated, mono ethnic country with a lack of funding support for the arts. We believe Armenia needs a truly international art center to welcome guest to our wonderful country.By increasing the space for our art center we will be able to achieve so much more:
Host up to 6-8 visitors at the same time, creating a real international and interdisciplinary atmosphere for creativity;
Establish an exchange studio, in the ‘microresidency’ model, available for studio exchange programs with other countries;
Host YOU as a contributor who would like to join our network, visit our art space and experience Armenian culture;
One of the rooms will be open also as a rental space for visitors; friends or relative of our visiting artist, or for those who wish to get to know Armenian culture alongside artists in a creative space;
The creativity we encourage doesn’t have boarders. We host artists from around the world to undertake research, production and exhibitions in Armenia;
Develop an educational dimension of ACOSS introducing socially engaged practices as a form of art to our emerging Armenian artists;
Continue to develop our ethos and mission as an international art center based in the community, with strong social impact towards social change;
Develop a self-funding model to keep our independent art institution thriving.
What We NeedWe need support from the international community to reach our goals.Our building total costs including official permits, municipal inspections, materials and labour are $89,500. Over the last 2 years we have raised $42,000 in cash donations towards land purchase and permits, and the building materials required to construct the building shell. All our work thus far has been undertaken with volunteer labour from our neighbours and friends. We are proud to say, the support we have already received has enable us to complete stage 1 of the project.We now need to raise a further $47,500 for the materials to complete stage 2 - to finish the project by May 2018, the deadline for official inspection.Cost breakdown:$ 4,800 - 4000 stones and bricks                           - (price for 1 brick - $ 10)$ 700   - 20 m³ sand                                                         - (price for 1 m³ - $ 35)$ 1,500 - 30 m² tiles                                                         - (price for 1 m² - $ 55)$ 800 - 8 taps and plumbing system                      - (price for 1 tap - $ 100)$ 2,300 - 23 m³ concrete                          - (price for 1 m³ concrete - $ 100)$ 1,500 - 10 ton cement                               - (price for 1 ton cement - $ 150)$ 2000 - 80 m² wooden floor                  - (price for 10 m² parquet - $ 250)$ 1,800 - 6 m³ wood for construction          - (price for 1 m³ wood - $ 300)$ 4,440 - 12 windows                                            - (price for 1 window - $ 370)$ 3,260 - 6 doors                                                        - (price for 1 door  - $ 540)$ 700 - Wire (Electricity system)                - (price for total wiring  - $ 700)$ 1,000 - Equipment (El. system)                - (price for El. system - $ 1000)​$ 1,200 - Plaster, paints, glue for tiles, varnish$ 2000 - Staircase$ 3000 - Heating system$ 4000 - Roof with waterproofing and thermal insulation$ 4,275 - Campaign fee 9 %$ 4,335 - Perks international shipping 10 %$ 3,890 - Contributor Perks 10 %Total - $47,500As much as possible, we are using eco-materials, working to European standards, and encouraging creativity in our processes.What if we don’t reach our goal, or raise even more?!If we don’t reach entire goal of fundraising, we will spend the money raised on the primary construction needs such as concrete or stones, roof insulation, windows etc, and continue with our fundraising.But if we raise more than our goal we will put funds into the next stage of renovations for furniture (beds, chairs, easels, shells for library, tables, kitchen furniture), facilities for a small gallery, a library, and to support artists production process and presentation (projectors, cables, computers, printers, point lights, etc.) and other such essentials. Our window to the worldWe are developing an international art space and our door is always open.

I started building it in 2002 with help of friends, our family and community. Permission giving us to build was temporarily and we didn’t own the land and it was going to be temporarily. It took us 3 years to finish the construction. After finishing main construction work we have been developing it since 2005, each year adding something new on the building interior making it more comfortable for our visiting guests and suitable for small events doing there.2 years ago, when we came to agreement with our government to get the studio permanently, not to use temporarily, to be able to invest there and develop as an professional art space, city municipality before giving us that certificate send to us building inspection group to check the quality of the building. We past the inspection and got the certificate of ownership and permission to use it for public events as well. That means, what we building work we did was in acceptable quality. That’s why that gave us permission to start expanding project and also permit to do main works on the construction by ourselves.Risks & ChallengesIf during building we change the project or design or don’t follow the project plan approved by Yerevan municipality, we run the risk of a big penalty. So we stick closely to the plan! Our permit for building expires by a strict deadline of May 2018, we have to complete the building and pass all inspections by that date.To have the project complete by the deadline we need find necessary budget to finish the construction.  We just will keep trying more campaigns until we get necessary budget and complete the 2nd stage of the project.How else can you help us? Join us in our mission to develop an international cultural exchange space and art center for our local community.

<h3>Why Tour Guides?</h3>
<p>Naoki started out as a host on Airbnb, the worldwide service allowing guests from around the world to stay in the home of a local. In three and a half years, Naoki greeted over 150 guests from around the world. Kevin was his second-ever guest, and from the moment of his arrival, he was moved by Naoki and his friends' genuine friendliness and eagerness to give him an amazing first impression of Tokyo, and decided to join him in showing Tokyo to the guests who followed. The two of them realized together that the most important thing in a foreign country is not seeing the sights or trying the food, but sharing those experiences with the people who live in and love their city.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507818634/joaxsxdhocsgjf160wws.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>That's why when Naoki was struggling with giving up the Tokyo Handsome Boys Airbnb to join the workforce, Kevin said, why not become a tour guide and keep doing Tokyo Handsome Boys as a career? It was a crazy idea, but we thought it just might work, and we want to prove that it can.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Reality of the Tokyo Tour Industry</h3>
<p>So what's so crazy about becoming a tour guide? Both Naoki and I were moved by our experiences with meeting international people and sharing our city with them, and in fact, we know many other young people share that experience. But becoming a tour guide isn't even considered as an option.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507536989/kd6uncielddfnvj6ufmd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>[Source: Japan Tourism Industry Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism]</p>
<p>In fact, only <strong>1% of all tour guides in Japan</strong> are in their 20's. But in a modern and evolving city like Tokyo, isn't it strange that the people introducing the city aren't the ones who are actually creating it, like the artists, musicians, and fashionistas we actually see enjoying and pouring their hearts into the city? We thought so too - but the problem is not without a reason.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507538584/utdgrsprgknkhqyfdgzz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The hard truth is, only <strong>4% of tour guides</strong> in Japan make a salary of over $40,000, that is, anywhere close to a regular full-time employee's salary. That's why it's generally the domain of retirees and mothers working to make extra pocket money, and not considered a real career. But we believe that's all going to change.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507538757/ch1xokgk0hyei3b62afq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Even in just the last 5 years, <strong>the number of yearly visitors to Japan has tripled</strong> from 8 million in 2012 to 24 million last year. And with the Olympics arriving in Tokyo in 2020, it's not about to stop. <strong>The time to act is now. </strong>That's why we decided to give up on becoming tour guides, and get started on creating <strong>our own tour business.</strong> But what young people boast in energy and passion, they lack in resources and experience. So it's no easy task for us to win against the currently established tour industry, which values repeating the same tour and the same information over and over for each client, like a conveyor belt. We think all these people visiting Tokyo for the first time deserve something better, and we think its young people have what it takes to provide it.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How Tokyo Handsome Boys are Changing That</h3>
<p>So we thought - How do we bridge this gap in people who love sharing experiences with international people but wouldn't dream of becoming a tour guide? The answer lies in giving tours that guides want to give, and guests want to receive. That's not accomplished by making guides memorizing the same textbook information that anyone can look up on Wikipedia in this day and age; it's accomplished by realizing the potential of their love for the city. And this isn't just some pie in the sky dream - Tokyo Handsome Boys is already running two types of tours which we believe embody that principle.</p>
<h3>1. Custom Tokyo Tour</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507819197/ycyewa3xqonw2djszeb6.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Tokyo's first ever custom tours; this is no private tour which might accommodate for a request or two, these are <strong>fully customized tours</strong> designed based around a questionnaire submitted to our guests in the weeks before the tour.</p>
<p>Below: An example submission for our Custom Tour survey.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507544247/rch29gdtaiobcx70zdpw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We're also currently offering a <strong>one-on-one Skype session</strong> preceding the tour to confirm the course we've planned and get personally acquainted with the guest before the tour. The custom tour has been our most popular tour up to this point, because it <strong>challenges us to be original</strong>, and <strong>provides our guests with the adventure and real local experience they're looking for</strong>. When the guides and guests create and live that one-of-a-kind experience together, the walls between guides and guests break down - they become friends who shared an amazing day in a city that's constantly full of surprises.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507821828/y6ruzazfwnwwbxcs5ebb.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>2. Shinjuku Nichome ""Rainbow Tokyo"" Tour</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507819141/d2txyfax0hzcpc81fiwq.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>With over 300 bars crammed into the size of a football field, Shinjuku Nichome is <strong>the densest gay bar district in the world</strong>. In recent years, it's gained popularity worldwide as a landmark of LGBT culture in Japan, but visiting tourists often don't make it beyond the five or six most visible bars and clubs. That's because all the unique, narrow <i>snack bars</i> here are windowless, with heavy doors, and even Shinjuku locals could have no idea what might lay inside each one. It's not easy to simply wander into any bar that catches your eye - <strong>Only true regulars here can break into the community and find the real nichome</strong>. That's why we spent a month before this tour exploring bars and finding the bar <i>mamas </i>who provide the best hospitality and entertainment to their guests. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507819100/lpsf3zjp2cuf4obsigdq.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What We Can Do With Your Contribution</h3>
<p>Cash is powerful, but without a clear direction it can vanish without a trace. We've laid out a concrete business plan to ensure that your investment will go into one place and one place only: <strong>Tours.</strong></p> <p>Funding our tours will have two main effects:</p>
<p>1. Giving us the ability to improve and deeper our existing tours with funding to research not just on the internet, but firsthand, laying foot to earth and food to mouth in Tokyo's local places</p>
<p>2. Allowing us to invest in creating new tours beyond our current limited scope</p> <p>If we are able to fund our mission thanks to everyone's help in this campaign, we plan to accomplish these goals with two significant types of expenses.</p> <h3>1. Exploring areas suited to our upcoming Custom Tours</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507828400/dupdw735s6dhvnwn84fm.jpg"" src=""""/><p>The most important part of a tour is the preparation stage. No amount of charisma can save a tour which is not properly structured and consistently entertaining. That's why for our custom tours, which are specially suited and designed to match each guest's interests and hopes for Tokyo, <strong>the preparation stage is where we spend the majority of our time and money</strong>. In order to find the most delicious and authentic food in each area and to plan the optimal course between each location, funds are absolutely essential. Your investment now will pay in the long run because it will improve the quality not only of our Custom Tours, but of all of our future tours as we use the areas we newly explore in designing new <strong>first-of-their-kind tours</strong>.</p> <h3>2. Electric bicycles to multiply our potential variety of tours</h3> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507829949/cnens23ecg2g6plxpgkj.jpg"" src=""""/><p>Tokyo is a sprawling city, and the number of tours which are feasible by walking and taking trains is limited, with most three-hour tours only covering a single area. Electric bicycles for us and our guests will give us the potential to <strong>cover huge swaths of land in a breeze</strong>, and to <strong>grasp the overall nature of Tokyo in a single tour instead of just one small portion</strong>. For the chaotic and disunified city of Tokyo, a Custom Tour with electric bicycles is ideal to cross from the peaceful temples, gardens and shopping streets of the <i>shitamachi</i> old town of the east in the day, to the whirling city of the future of the west city at night. Electric bicycles are easy to ride for the young and old, the energetic and the exhausted alike, and at <strong>only around $500 each</strong> they're well worth the investment. And as a bonus, since we can ride our own electric bicycles to explore new potential tour sites, they'll boost our efficiency during both preparation and the tours themselves.</p> <p>Making these tours is our passion, but nothing compares to the joy of seeing our guests' faces light up upon seeing a side of Tokyo they never expected. If we can succeed even a bit in bringing that guest-first spirit to the world of Tokyo tours, it is worth anything we can give. We would be so honored to have you be a part of this dream!</p> <p>~ Naoki and Kevin, the TOKYO HANDSOME BOYS</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507826706/bpt7xouetx20p8omtxrr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div></div>","Why Tour Guides?
Naoki started out as a host on Airbnb, the worldwide service allowing guests from around the world to stay in the home of a local. In three and a half years, Naoki greeted over 150 guests from around the world. Kevin was his second-ever guest, and from the moment of his arrival, he was moved by Naoki and his friends' genuine friendliness and eagerness to give him an amazing first impression of Tokyo, and decided to join him in showing Tokyo to the guests who followed. The two of them realized together that the most important thing in a foreign country is not seeing the sights or trying the food, but sharing those experiences with the people who live in and love their city.

That's why when Naoki was struggling with giving up the Tokyo Handsome Boys Airbnb to join the workforce, Kevin said, why not become a tour guide and keep doing Tokyo Handsome Boys as a career? It was a crazy idea, but we thought it just might work, and we want to prove that it can.
 

The Reality of the Tokyo Tour Industry
So what's so crazy about becoming a tour guide? Both Naoki and I were moved by our experiences with meeting international people and sharing our city with them, and in fact, we know many other young people share that experience. But becoming a tour guide isn't even considered as an option.

[Source: Japan Tourism Industry Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism]
In fact, only 1% of all tour guides in Japan are in their 20's. But in a modern and evolving city like Tokyo, isn't it strange that the people introducing the city aren't the ones who are actually creating it, like the artists, musicians, and fashionistas we actually see enjoying and pouring their hearts into the city? We thought so too - but the problem is not without a reason.

The hard truth is, only 4% of tour guides in Japan make a salary of over $40,000, that is, anywhere close to a regular full-time employee's salary. That's why it's generally the domain of retirees and mothers working to make extra pocket money, and not considered a real career. But we believe that's all going to change.

Even in just the last 5 years, the number of yearly visitors to Japan has tripled from 8 million in 2012 to 24 million last year. And with the Olympics arriving in Tokyo in 2020, it's not about to stop. The time to act is now. That's why we decided to give up on becoming tour guides, and get started on creating our own tour business. But what young people boast in energy and passion, they lack in resources and experience. So it's no easy task for us to win against the currently established tour industry, which values repeating the same tour and the same information over and over for each client, like a conveyor belt. We think all these people visiting Tokyo for the first time deserve something better, and we think its young people have what it takes to provide it.
 
How Tokyo Handsome Boys are Changing That
So we thought - How do we bridge this gap in people who love sharing experiences with international people but wouldn't dream of becoming a tour guide? The answer lies in giving tours that guides want to give, and guests want to receive. That's not accomplished by making guides memorizing the same textbook information that anyone can look up on Wikipedia in this day and age; it's accomplished by realizing the potential of their love for the city. And this isn't just some pie in the sky dream - Tokyo Handsome Boys is already running two types of tours which we believe embody that principle.
1. Custom Tokyo Tour

Tokyo's first ever custom tours; this is no private tour which might accommodate for a request or two, these are fully customized tours designed based around a questionnaire submitted to our guests in the weeks before the tour.
Below: An example submission for our Custom Tour survey.

We're also currently offering a one-on-one Skype session preceding the tour to confirm the course we've planned and get personally acquainted with the guest before the tour. The custom tour has been our most popular tour up to this point, because it challenges us to be original, and provides our guests with the adventure and real local experience they're looking for. When the guides and guests create and live that one-of-a-kind experience together, the walls between guides and guests break down - they become friends who shared an amazing day in a city that's constantly full of surprises.

 
2. Shinjuku Nichome ""Rainbow Tokyo"" Tour


With over 300 bars crammed into the size of a football field, Shinjuku Nichome is the densest gay bar district in the world. In recent years, it's gained popularity worldwide as a landmark of LGBT culture in Japan, but visiting tourists often don't make it beyond the five or six most visible bars and clubs. That's because all the unique, narrow snack bars here are windowless, with heavy doors, and even Shinjuku locals could have no idea what might lay inside each one. It's not easy to simply wander into any bar that catches your eye - Only true regulars here can break into the community and find the real nichome. That's why we spent a month before this tour exploring bars and finding the bar mamas who provide the best hospitality and entertainment to their guests. 


STEP INTO RAINBOW TOKYO!
 
What We Can Do With Your Contribution
Cash is powerful, but without a clear direction it can vanish without a trace. We've laid out a concrete business plan to ensure that your investment will go into one place and one place only: Tours. Funding our tours will have two main effects:
1. Giving us the ability to improve and deeper our existing tours with funding to research not just on the internet, but firsthand, laying foot to earth and food to mouth in Tokyo's local places
2. Allowing us to invest in creating new tours beyond our current limited scope If we are able to fund our mission thanks to everyone's help in this campaign, we plan to accomplish these goals with two significant types of expenses. 1. Exploring areas suited to our upcoming Custom Tours
The most important part of a tour is the preparation stage. No amount of charisma can save a tour which is not properly structured and consistently entertaining. That's why for our custom tours, which are specially suited and designed to match each guest's interests and hopes for Tokyo, the preparation stage is where we spend the majority of our time and money. In order to find the most delicious and authentic food in each area and to plan the optimal course between each location, funds are absolutely essential. Your investment now will pay in the long run because it will improve the quality not only of our Custom Tours, but of all of our future tours as we use the areas we newly explore in designing new first-of-their-kind tours. 2. Electric bicycles to multiply our potential variety of tours Tokyo is a sprawling city, and the number of tours which are feasible by walking and taking trains is limited, with most three-hour tours only covering a single area. Electric bicycles for us and our guests will give us the potential to cover huge swaths of land in a breeze, and to grasp the overall nature of Tokyo in a single tour instead of just one small portion. For the chaotic and disunified city of Tokyo, a Custom Tour with electric bicycles is ideal to cross from the peaceful temples, gardens and shopping streets of the shitamachi old town of the east in the day, to the whirling city of the future of the west city at night. Electric bicycles are easy to ride for the young and old, the energetic and the exhausted alike, and at only around $500 each they're well worth the investment. And as a bonus, since we can ride our own electric bicycles to explore new potential tour sites, they'll boost our efficiency during both preparation and the tours themselves. Making these tours is our passion, but nothing compares to the joy of seeing our guests' faces light up upon seeing a side of Tokyo they never expected. If we can succeed even a bit in bringing that guest-first spirit to the world of Tokyo tours, it is worth anything we can give. We would be so honored to have you be a part of this dream! ~ Naoki and Kevin, the TOKYO HANDSOME BOYS",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>COVID-19 UPDATE</strong></h2>
<p>To our attendees, vendors, artists, community partners, sponsors, and team members:</p>
<p>After much consideration, we have decided to postpone the Riverlights Music Festival, which was scheduled to take place on June 5 and 6, 2020. This was a very difficult decision, but given the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic, this was the only realistic option. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been affected by this pandemic. In these difficult times, we will do our part to ensure the protection of public health while also helping our community recover.</p>
<p><strong>We have decided to continue the Indiegogo campaign but <u>will be donating all proceeds to our local musicians</u> who are in desperate need of support.  All claimed perks will be honored. In addition you can choose to get a refund if you decide to withdraw your previous (pre-update) contribution to this campaign. Please email us if you have any questions (riverlightsmusicfestival@gmail.com).</strong></p>
<p>There is so much work and planning that goes into our music festival. Our team was excited about this year’s new location of Howard Park and the experience enhancements that we had planned. Rest assured that this excitement will carry on into the next phase of Riverlights Music Festival planning. Because of the uncertainty of the current pandemic, it is unclear at this time just how and when we will return. While we have hopes of having an event within this calendar year, we will almost certainly be back in 2021. In the meantime, the talented and generous members of the Riverlights team will be exploring new and creative ways to help support our local artist community. Please keep an eye on our social media platforms for new announcements as we move forward.</p>
<p>South Bend is a town that knows something about perseverance. The Riverlights Music Festival team will be a proud partner in its recovery. Today the rule is social distancing, but there will come a time when normality will resume and we will be free to enjoy live music on warm summer days. Until then, please stay safe and be healthy.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Founder &amp; CEO: Nigel Jones has over 20 year of experience in the retail management industry. The idea to create the PromoCaribbean app all started with Nigel, who is from the small Island of Grenada (also in the Caribbean). iDestiny Tech Lab (app developer) has 4+ years experience in the Mobile App industry and 7+ years experience in the Web Development industry.</p>
<p>We have taken this idea from concept to reality in a matter of about 6 months (app launch October 2016). Now we need Indiegogo's help to take us to the next level.  We need funding for advertising that will generate more downloads throughout North America and the United Kingdom.  The funding will also be used to continue with branding such as Caribbean community event sponsorship (specifically for summer 2017).</p>
<p>Contributors will help us to achieve more downloads and user ship, making PromoCaribbean more attractive to the businesses we target to list in our business listings category.  Business listings in turn will generate the revenue we need to make PromoCaribbean a self sustaining business.</p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
</div><div>
<p>We are asking for 15,000 USD. The amounts will be distributed as follows: 5,000 USD for download advertising.  Another 5,000 USD for PromoCaribbean branding and sponsorship initiatives. Lastly, for legal fees and product development 5,000 USD.</p>
<p>Contributors will get 6 months of free advertising on our app with a minimum of 100 USD contribution. PromoCaribbean is the one stop shop for everything Caribbean! Users have access to Caribbean news, live TV streaming, over 380 Caribbean radio stations, Caribbean music and much more in the palm of their hands.  All of this and the app is absolutely FREE to download!</p>
<p>If we are not able to raise the full amount we need, we will use the funds for download advertising and branding.  These two areas are most important to our success.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The PromoCaribbean app is the first of its kind.  Our app targets the entire Caribbean (English, Spanish, French and Dutch).  So far we have been rated as #2 in ""Travel"" apps on Appliv (a mobile app discovery platform) <a href=""https://app-liv.com/en/hobbies/travel/10068?id=3594917"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">read more</a>.  The app is available for download from <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.promo.caribbean"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Play Store</a> and the <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/promo-caribbean/id1142918091?ls=1&amp;mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">App Store</a>; it has over 57,000 downloads. </p>
<p>Outreach is very important to us. One of our missions is to give back to the Caribbean community. Your support enables PromoCaribbean to help others in the Caribbean region.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The major obstacle we face is reaching our targeted users. We need additional funding for more advertising to reach them. With a wider audience, businesses will find it more attractive to list with us. Using social media advertising we are able to specifically select our users.  We also been participating in a variety of Caribbean events in North American to generate brand awareness.</p>
<p>The Brampton Entrepreneurial Centre and the Research Innovation and Commercialization Centre have been very supportive in helping with business seminars, access to market data and soft skills development.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you aren't able to contribute financially, we would love to have you download the app, rate it and share it.  We are also welcome to any suggestions or advice on product improvement. You can also use the Indigogo share feature to invite a friend to contribute!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">GARNER Arts Center and Building 35</h2>
<p>Thanks to the tremendous support of our community we have made excellent progress in turning Building 35, the Historic District’s former cafeteria, into a state of the art interdisciplinary arts center. Focus groups held along the way have taught us a great deal, but the one thing that resonates with us the most is that this community needs a meeting place. A place open 7 days a week. A place accepting of everyone. A place that can create, nurture and sustain the local arts community while connecting with the regional and national arts scene. Once complete, Building 35 will be the gateway to this historic complex and a true community treasure.</p>
<p>Your help thus far has allowed us to lay a new floor, upgrade electrical work, begin landscaping the sculpture garden and more. But it’s time for us to focus on what’s most important – access for everyone. This major infrastructure setback has been a thorn in our side since we lost our Gallery in Hurricane Irene and we are ready to make a change, but we need your help!</p>
<p><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></u></p>
<p>You helped us lay down the floor, you’ve helped us with the foundation and the sculpture garden and the electrical work. You’ve helped us remain optimistic - keeping our eyes on the potential of the future, and now we need your help raising $15,000 to demolish the old stairs and create something a little more welcoming.<br/><br/><strong>""GARNER, besides being a part of something cool - what are the perks?""</strong><br/> </p>
<p>$10 or more - A great big ""THANK YOU"" and your name listed on our website donor wall</p>
<p>$25 or more – A great big “THANK YOU” plus a DVD on the history of this crazy, beautiful, historic site.</p>
<p>$75 or more – All of the above PLUS a bag of coffee from our on-site café, Stack Street Café</p>
<p>$100 or more – All of the above PLUS – we’ll give you a GARNER reusable tote bag and send you over to our friends at Area24 Radio for some serious crate digging. Find a gem, throw it in your tote and be on your way!</p>
<p>$250 or more – All of the above PLUS – personalized studio visits with Garnerville Artists. <i>Up to 8 people, for a one hour tour (2 studios).</i></p>
<p>$500 or more – All of the above PLUS – an Industrial Arts Brewing Company tasting/tour guided by brewery Founder &amp; Owner, Jeff O’Neil. <i>Up to 8 people.</i></p>
<p>$750 or more – A signed (unframed) Frank Welles etching</p>
<p>$1250 or more – A signed (unframed) Frank Welles etching PLUS a brick on the “Visionary Walk”, the brick path leading into Building 35. A permanent display of your support for making art accessible to everyone!</p>
<p>$2500 – Tour of the GARNER Historic District guided by 2nd generation owner &amp; President, Robin E. Rosenberg. Her knowledge of the grounds will take you and your party on a journey through past, present &amp; future. End the tour with privately catered, pop-up warehouse dinner in a surprise location. We’ll do the decorating, we’ll provide the drinks, and Susan Stava Photography will capture all the happy memories. <i>This is available for up to 8 people.</i></p>
<p><u><strong>The Impact</strong></u></p>
<p>Your donation is crucial in becoming the community resource we know we have the potential to be, but in order to do that we need to be able to be everyone’s community resource. We want to be your arts center; a place to connect, to seek inspiration, to challenge yourself, and to discover qualities in yourself and your community you didn’t know existed before. Be a part of that development, help us to open our doors to anyone who wants to come in. </p>
<p><u><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></u></p>
<p>We are a small, but mighty organization. Our Board of Directors is a volunteer board, and our staff is small. We are reliant on the kindness of our community to help us in our transformation. We know that your time and resources are valuable, and we appreciate every little bit anyone can give.</p>
<p><u><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></u></p>
<p>Can’t make a financial contribution? That’s ok! This campaign is dependent on social sharing, please email/tweet/snap/post/gram to anyone in your circle who you think may be able to help. Not that into social sharing, but you’re willing to roll up your sleeves? A grassroots campaign like this one heavily relies on the kindness of strangers, and friends. A significant portion of the labor on this project has been generously donated, and our needs aren’t slowing down. We desperately need certified laborers, passionate gardeners, and visionaries. If you think you can help by providing in-kind labor please email info@garnerartscenter.org. We’re also always seeking material donations – give us a call and see how your business can make a tax deductible product donation today!</p>
