Célestin demeure dans un appartement, au rez-de-chaussée. Plusieurs voisins et amis l’entourent et vivent tout aussi paisiblement, même s’ils ont chacun une vie très différente. Célestin aime beaucoup la musique, tellement qu’il en a fait son gagne-pain. Un matin, Célestin se rend au supermarché; il fait beau, le ciel est clair et il sourit. Une fois arrivé, il prend, comme à l’habitude, un panier pour y déposer ses achats.

<p>Pour les 4 à 11 ans et comme pour les adultes, à la fois éducatif et drôle, Zig Zag le citron emporte avec lui sa magie, et se nourrit des forces semées sur sa route, dans ses voyages avec Merlin le Touta (Marianne Farley) où il fait la rencontre de précieux amis qui feront partie de sa vie, comme Madame Georgette (Maxime Le Flaguais), Richard l’africain (MC Gilles), la vieille grand-maman et d'autres personnages épisodiques qui feront sa rencontre. Les illustrations des personnages sont de la talentueuse April Petchsri.  Certains artistes comme Tristan-Loys Perrot, Niki Lambros et Claudia Laurie prêteront leurs voix à des personnages secondaires hauts en couleurs! D'autres artistes s'ajouteront au fil du temps! <br/></p>

<h3>Once Upon a Time...</h3>
<p>... there were four girls - Mia, Rose, Marissa and Morgan. The first three girls were from Arizona, USA; Morgan was from Sydney, Australia. They lived together for 4 fantastic months in Tucson, Arizona. They were the best of friends and had brilliant fun together. But then, Morgan's exchange was over and she had to go home to Australia. Everyone was very upset and the girls missed each other very much.</p>
<p>But then! The girls came up with a brilliant plan to save up enough money for the three Americans to travel to Australia. Morgan's 21st birthday is in December and they thought that would be the perfect time to visit. They realised very quickly that it costs a lot of money to travel from the US to Australia though, and that they would need help to get there.</p>
<p>The magnitude of this plan is far beyond us - but it's a dream that's very close to our hearts. The sheer joy that would come out of being able to see each other again is too big for words and we would be unimaginably grateful for any help you can give us.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>So, here's the deal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Return flights from Phoenix to Sydney = $2,500</li>
<li>x 3 for each of the girls</li>
<li>= $7,500</li>
<li>+ Indiegogo fees and the possibility of rising prices</li>
<li>= approx. $8000</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a lot of money. But Indiegogo only allows for 60 day campaigns - and while we're positive, we're not positive enough to assume we can raise $8000 in two months. So we've set a more realistic goal of $4000 (to avoid higher fees from Indiegogo if we don't reach our goal).</p>
<p>If we raise more than that, we will be very, very happy. If we reach $8000, we will be bloody ecstatic. And if not, we take stock of how much we have, how much we have saved ourselves by that point and maybe try a second campaign or other avenues to raise the rest of the money. Of course, we're all working very hard at our own jobs to save as much as we can.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Our eternal gratitude and love.</p>
<p>And some lovely perks that we're offering because we know that giving is a two-way street. We can't give you some of the awesome, fantastic perks that other Indiegogo projects offer - but we think they're pretty humbly cool.</p>
<p>We hope that the perks make you feel like you are a part of our journey and each will be picked, made or bought with love and care to show how much we appreciate your gift. Whether it be a handwritten postcard from Australia (it's a pretty cool place!) or a blouse, lovingly sewn by Morgan - we hope you enjoy it as much as we'll enjoy this opportunity to spend time together!</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Please spread the word! Share this campaign with friends, family, followers, etc. The more people know about this, the more chance we have of reaching our goal.</p>
<p>Also, if you have tips on where to get cheap flights (etc.) that we might not know about - please let us know. Any help is appreciated!</p>

<p><strong>Help Create MusicianRights.org</strong></p>
<p>This campaign is to help MusicianRights.org get up and running. This social enterprise will unite Musicians to regain their power in contract negotiations, which will establish a more fair system. This translates to more money for Musicians!</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Davina Amiri and I am an Artists' lawyer as well as a singer-songwriter based in NY. I negotiate contracts on behalf of numerous Artists and was mentioned in Variety Magazine last year for representing a film-maker on his distribution deal.</li>
<li>While representing Artists, I have been alarmed by the pervasive use of lopsided contracts businesses expect Artists to sign.</li>
<li>After going to SXSW 2013 and listening to many music experts and panelists, I saw the need for a strong and aggressive representative voice for musicians in the Music Industry. </li>
<li>As the Entertainment Industry evolves and adapts to collaborate and use new technologies, now is the time for Musicians to come together.</li>
<li>Let's unite Musicians not from the hands of corporations, but from the hands of Musicians and Musician lovers themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>I truly believe if all Musicians come together through this organization and agree to certain minimum requirements for contracts, they will establish a new standard and finally have an equal playing field in the Music Industry.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We need to raise money!</p>
<ul>
<li>To get started, we need approx. $3,500 for Website, Logo, Intellectual Property Acquisition, and Promotion.</li>
<li>All extra money will go towards running the website and expanding the organization (promotion, etc.)</li>
<li>We will seek B Corporation certification, which is a new class of companies seeking social impact. Certification will show our commitment to transparency.</li>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p><em>WE ARE STARTING A MOVEMENT! BE A PART OF IT!:</em></p>
<p>It is common knowledge that musicians earn a substantially less percentage of profits as compared to the businesses that profit from their music. This is because musicians have very little bargaining power, especially when first beginning their careers. They are the targets of bad contracts, which sometimes remain with them their entire careers.</p>
<p>MusicianRights.org (MR) wants Musicians to receive their fair share of the profits from their music. There are varying ways to address this, but MR is focusing on the contract itself.</p>
<p>HOW will MusicianRights.org work?</p>
<p>◦                      First Goals:</p>
<p>- Define Musician Rights and Educate musicians about their Rights.</p>
<p>- Every “Musician Member” will sign our Memo stating they will not contract away their Musician Rights. The Memo will define those rights as well as state other affirmations.</p>
<p>- Every “Musician Lover Member” will sign a statement in support of the Memo and also be a member.</p>
<p>- Membership - 1) Signing the memo/affirmation and 2) contributing at least $1 will make you a member. There will be different levels of paid membership, from $1 and up. Using our logo on any social media will be a suggested donation of $20 to support the cause.</p>
<p>◦                       Second Goals:</p>
<p>- Once membership hits critical mass, we will put pressure on key Music Industry players who are taking advantage of musicians. We will also highlight Artist friendly businesses practices.</p>
<p>◦                      Third Goals:</p>
<p>- As Congress gets closer to re-writing the Copyright Act, we will be a voice in any debate on Copyright law.</p>
<p><strong>What Makes Us Different?</strong></p>
<p>Musician Rights is different from any other ogranization advocating for musicians, because 1) it is free of entrenched business interests 2) will define Musician Rights 3) unite all musicians and musician lover's and 4) start a movement where musicians agree to certain contract standards that should be in every contract. </p>

<p>**12/25/11 - Pix added of the band trailer, breakdown for what the donations will be used for added**<br/></p>
<p>**12/27/11 - Updated info about perks, drawing of drum box #1 added to the gallery**<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Ok, so here is the short version of what I am doing. This will evolve, but I needed to get this up and going right away. Why, you ask? The end of this campaign will be on April 20th, 2012 Which will be the 3 year anniversary of my younger brother passing.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>April 20th 2009, I was woke up by a friend pounding on my door, she told me my mother had been trying to get a hold of me since 6:00 in the morning. After calling her, I heard the worst news anyone could hear. My younger brother was no longer with us. (It is still an open case to this day)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This was the start to a really bad year, by June of that year I lost my job, by July we lost our house and had to move. We were lucky, my parents have some rental properties, one of them happened to be empty, so we had a place to go. We had to move to a small city named Ault, Co. over 90 miles away from our home in Denver. It's a small town, small town life, where everyone knows everyone and everyone's business. Not a bad place, but not a good place for someone who thrives for the big city life. I have lived in Denver, L.A. and Boston, this small town is great for those who like small towns, but it's not for me.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I was working in Denver and had another band going, but the commute and cost of such was just too much, then my job cut my hours back so far, it made it impossible for me to continue to work for them. So, I have been on unemployment since Feb of this year.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Ok, so this all sounds like a sob story, and yes there were several things that have caused many issues for me, but there are some upsides to everything. I have been making all of my payments since Feb and got my student loans out of default, have everything set up and will be going to school again in Jan. I have finished paying off my band trailer, it's a 5x8, black enclosed trailer with a side door and the rear door folds down like a ramp for loading gear. I also came across a new merch stand, this is one of the types you see at conventions, stands 6 feet tall, 8 feet wide in a semi curved shape with velcro walls so anything can hang out it. It folds down into a case about 3 feet tall and about a foot around. And if you can believe it, I found it for FREE on Craig's list.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So yeah, there has been good and bad that has happened. The point of this campaign is to help raise money for a couple of reasons, The trailer needs new tags, I have some gear that has broken down after years of playing and needs replaced, and I need to get back to Denver, CO so I can get back into the scene.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So, I am sure you are wondering, ""Why should I help this guy out?"" Here is a little background on me. My name is Kelsey, I have been playing music since I was 7, started playing semi-pro ever since I was 16. I've been all over, played a ton of shows, met many many people and have had a great time along the way. Music has been something I have done my whole life, being in this small city has been a drain on my playing and I need to get back to the big city.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Ok, so as promised here is a break down of what this money will be going towards. $300 is for new tags for the band trailer (a few pix of the trailer have been posted), $3600 is for a full years worth of rent at the band rehearsal space, $1000 is going for new gear which includes another ATA case for gear and the last $100 is for gas to get the gear and get everything back to Denver. The perk (on the right hand side of the screen) are pretty self explanatory. I will be posting images of the stickers and shirts shortly.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Impact, that is a funny word, how would this impact me, my family, friends, ect....  Ok, well first of all, this would get me back to a big city and back into a great band. I already have some of the members ready to go, Of course the replacing of gear is huge, it allows me to continue playing. Friends, Family and the such would love to see me on stage again, they all know what it means to me and to my personal life. Not to mention, getting back to the big city allows for better job opportunities, which means more money, which means I can care for my family and band much more so than I can up here.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

Send the link on your face book account, your twitter, blogs, personal sites, write it on a paper and hand it to someone, every little bit counts and helps, more than you know.<br/></p></div></div>","**12/25/11 - Pix added of the band trailer, breakdown for what the donations will be used for added**

<h3><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">What's this all about? <br/></span></h3>I'm a solo musician on a quest to get my album into the physical world and to find some financial support for my goal. The goal is to advance one step further into getting an album I've build from the ground up as a solo effort into printed physical cases. Once I have enough I will have a printing press make many copies of the album that I will use to distribute. They will be sent out to musical magazines, Pandora and many other similar areas of interest. The physical CD is by far the most crucial step to being recognized as a legitimate musician. <br/><br/>The second half of the goal is to also get some other merchandise created, such as T-shirts and other similar merchandise. <br/><br/><h3>The plus:</h3>
<p>With many of the projects you come across on here, you're supporting a vision that hasn't been created yet. You aimlessly go into something with the mere hope that it'll A.) turn out well enough &amp; B.) happen at all. There's no guarantees after you support. The plus to my project is that <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">it's done</span>! It's finished. It already exists. What you're supporting is the printing process and not just a floating vision. If I reach my goal, then it's done that week.   <br/></p>
<br/><h3>History:</h3>
<p>Ever since I was a child I've found enjoyment in learning new instruments and finding interesting ways to play them. As I got older I found a desire to recording multiple instruments together which eventually lead to the beginning traces of recording. As the years went by I studied how the sounds that instruments make could be captured into computers and compiled with other recorded tracks to make a complete song. In the later years I spent a day with a man who had built his own recording studio and I learned how it all came together professionally. In modern day I have a modest but effective studio that works well for what I do. Here I can record my many instruments and compose songs and albums. It is my biggest passion of interest.     </p>
<br/><h3>What you get in return:</h3>In return for supporting me on my goal I will shower you with recognition in both the printed album and on my site. I'm amazed as to how many extremely supportive individuals there are in this community and it's given me strong hope for independent artists to flourish. In addition I will also send you a signed album when it's done being printed. For those who donate higher amounts of money, I will add original ink artwork with the CD, each being one-of-a-kind. I will also send 1-2 items of merchandise to people who donate $35+<br/>And on top of all that, if I play a show that you attend, I will gladly take you out to dinner afterward as a sign of appreciation. <br/><br/><h3>Last thoughts:</h3>

West Coast singer/songwriter Katie Thompson’s star is most definitely on
the rise. This talented Hokitika lass has released two albums in the past three
years, was chosen by popular vote to open for Elton John at his only New Zealand show this coming
November and she’s been nominated for both Female Artist of the Year and the
Horizon Award at the 2011 National Country Music Awards. 
 
Katie’s debut album, Tall Poppy was released in 2009 and the record
caught the attention of the international funding website Sellaband, where fans
invest in the careers sof their favourite artists, with the aim of helping
them hit the US$50,000 needed to record and release an album.
Katie was one of the fastest-ever artists to achieve the funding goal and the
resulting album Impossible blends elements of folk, pop and country into a
collection of bittersweet and beautiful songs. It was released this year to
critical acclaim from even the most hardened music press, who have described
her sound as “entrancing.” 

What's Next
Righteo - me talking in first person now!!! Well as you can imagine.... opening for Elton John in November is quite a big deal and I want to make the most of it. Thanks to the beautiful people who helped me with my last IndieGoGo project I was able to make my first music video for ""Good As Gold"". The single made it's way Classic Hits ""As Kiwi As"" and has enjoyed airplay throughout the world and the music video has had 3,500+ hits on YouTube.

So this time, I would like to make a music video for the next single ""Impossible"".

The talented Logan McMillan from Gorilla Pictures will be the director - see Mel Parson's latest music video for ""I Won't Let You Down"" for examples of his work.

We are planning the video at the moment and as soon as the details are finalised I'll let you know exactly what it's going to look like. At this stage we will be filming it in Christchurch, New Zealand in early November.


The Impact
To make the biggest impact the release of the single & video should happen at the same time and preferably before November 25th - when I'll be opening for Elton John. Impossible is the strongest track on the album and I feel like it is the one that deserves an amazing music video to get the song out there.


What I Need & What You Get
The standard cost in NZ to make a music video is $5,000.
If there is any money left over it will be used to promote the single.

<h3>Our Story</h3>The band Fevers and myself are looking to garner your support to help make their very first music video. ""Passion is Dead (Long Live Fashion)"" is their title track of their recent EP release, and also the track we've selected to create a video for. <br/><p><br/>This is a great track and deserves a great video, help us do it justice and show your support!<br/><br/>You can also download their album FREE via their Bandcamp: <a href=""http://www.fevers.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.fevers.bandcamp.com</a><br/></p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It's kind of ironic when I think about it. The track ""Passion is Dead (Long Live Fashion)"" talks about how sometimes you can feel like there is no longer passion surrounding bands and music, and people are more concerned with superficial things like fashion and how expensive your jeans are. So it's interesting that this band has somehow managed to attract a small team of creative people committed to see them make an amazing music video. We can all relate to the track, it can be quite discouraging, but this project has already attracted businesses and individuals who are all passionate enough about music to contribute their own time and money to make it successful. Join the team and show Fevers that passion is not dead...entirely. <br/><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We currently have some the necessary pieces to make this video happen. ie. Cameras, editing equipment, volunteers etc. But because of the nature of the song, we really want to represent the true 'essence' of the music, this means having money to rent a space(s) to shoot it in and allow us to rent some of the other pieces of equipment to see our concept through to an actual video.  <br/><br/> At the moment, many other people have graciously offered their services for free or at an extremely reduced cost. i.e. post production/3-D animation, lighting operation/design etc. The money we will raise will go towards renting all the lighting gear ie. rigs, moving lights, boards, dollies etc. as well as the space itself.<br/><br/> We've been fortunate so far that so many talented people are willing to lend their technical skills free of charge, we now just need YOUR help to help raise the necessary funds to rent the gear itself. (The only thing people can't give us for free really). <br/><br/>Ever had a 30 second song written and performed exclusively for you? On the right side of this page you'll see how we are trying to give back to those who show support. You can choose from a range of perks so you won't feel like you're going away empty handed. <br/><br/>With your help, you'll be joining the rest of this team of people who have all seen/heard how great this band's music is and can be. <br/></p>

As you may already be aware we are very much a DIY band and we've deliberately knocked back certain labels in order to maintain our own artistic vision.

<p>We've already raised some funds through our very own club night, 'No Direction' which can be found in the groovy venues around London every few months. But it's not enough.

<p>We just want to play to as many people as we can.</p>
<p>Any contribution you can give regardless of size would be immensely helpful and massively appreciated. It gets us that much closer to our relatively modest goal. If you're strapped for cash, don't sweat it - simply sharing this campaign with others is great - and it won't take but a moment of your time!</p>
<p>Music is so accessible these days, you can log on to youtube and pretend you are at Woodstock, and that's all well and good but NOTHING can replicate that feeling of being at a live gig. We never want to stop playing live shows (the longer the better as far as we're concerned), and even though less and less bands are going on tour these days, we are old-fashioned in that we want to play for anyone that will listen. When we were growing up we went to see our favourite bands play and it changed our lives forever, what an amazing thing it would be if it went full-circle and we were able to do that for the next group of youngsters out there.</p>

Drum machine and synth parts will also be included. You have full permission to use these files and loops for anything you want; music, film, video games, whatever! </p>
<p>The drums will be played by Jason Bazinet (SMP, 16volt, Front Line Assembly).

<p>I'm adding a full band to my acoustic-rock album in order to produce radio friendly versions of some of my popular upbeat material, including ""I'm Sorry to Tell You,"" ""Dead Man Walking"" and ""I've Been Through it All.""  Surplus money will be used to create marketing material.</p>

<p>$300   Live acoustic performance by me at your next event (the more random the event, the better; e.g. business meetings, funerals, award ceremonies for other artists) PLUS the perks of the first three levels.</p>
<p>$2000  Fund the entire project in one fell swoop, and you'll receive a breathalyzer exam and complimentary straight jacket*</p>
<p>*not a real perk; you'll just get everything coming to you at all the levels below, plus a personalized thank you</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<h1><strong>BE SURE TO CLICK THE GALLERY TAB ABOVE TO CHECK OUT SOME PRETTY COOL MUSIC VIDEOS!</strong></h1>
<h1>MY STORY...</h1>
<p>In a day and time where real music with a message seems to be taking a back seat to the manufacturing of artists based on age and image, I truly believe ""The Journey Volume One"", set for release in fall of 2012 will make you ""see"" the music with your ears. </p>
<p>I'm known mostly as a featured artist on many European House and Dance music hits, including “Shined On Me” with the Praise Cats, and also as a supporting and backing vocalist - I've worked with artists such as Al Jarreau, Angela Winbush, Esperanza Spalding,  Frank McComb, George Duke, Gerald Albright, Michael Manson, Nona Hendryx, and Terri Lyne Carrington to name a few. Now, I think the time is just right for me to release  this debut CD as a great alternative for us ""grown folks"" that are seeking balance in today's music :-)</p>
<div>
<h1>THE PROJECT...</h1>
<p>This project will include a mixture of songs that will be both up tempo and down tempo Acid Jazz, Smooth Jazz and Soul, that lyrically reflect on love and everyday life - from the good, to the bad, to the human, to the crazy - and how it's all gonna eventually be alright! :-) Basically, this project is for the adult contemporary listener that loves, supports and seeks REAL, LIVE music by REAL artists!</p>
<h1>THE TEAM...</h1>
<p>This project will have lots of live instrumentation by some of the best musicians around, and includes collaborations with Grammy-nominated producer/remixer Eric “E Smoove” Miller, who is also co-executive producer, and Grammy-winning producer/remixer Maurice Joshua, as well as writers that have to their credit a number of songs that have hit Billboard charts in various genres, as well as other music charts around the world – guaranteeing nothing less than a quality body of work.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h1>THE FACT IS...</h1>
<p>The project is being completed independent of major record labels, which is a good thing because it guarantees that the artistry stays pure – but it also means that the project's completion is at the mercy of my finances and contributions from people like you. Now - - the <em>really cool</em> thing is, through your contribution, you are actually helping to create the music that YOU want to hear! This is why....I NEED YOU!!!!</p>
<p>Contributions will pay for:</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi my name is Justin and I'm reaching out to everyone whos ever been wronged by our so called justice system. My brother, Johnathon, is one of these people. He is incarcerated at the moment due to the incompetancy of his lawyer who had drained him for every penny he had. My brother had broken his back almost literally working weeks on end to come up with the money to pay this lawyer. At the end of the week my brother was lucky to have enough money left over from paying Dave Partridge to buy himself a pack of cigarettes. For months he did this, he had to give up his appartment he had and had to move back in with my mother and I.After John had literally bent over backwards to apease his lawyer and pay him what he had asked for the lawyer still did not do his job. Not one part of the case was handled professionally, if I were a member of the BAR association and could represent my brother I think I could have made a better case for him. Everything that the lawyer had based his case on for self defense the judge had thrown it out of court because it was irrelevent. John is not a bad person running around doing horrible things. He's a 24 year old man who's caught up in a confusing and crazy world. He did what he believed was right to save his friends life and in the end his friend, lawyer and even the entire justice system had stabbed him the back and left him out to hang dry. He's not a murderer or a thief or a rapist, he's a loving caring, Happy-go-lucky person, sure he could have his dark days, but who doesn't? Does he really deserve to rot in a prison because he did what our mother had taught us, to do ever since we were little, to protect your friends and family at all costs? Are we all just as bad as everyone on the inside of the institutions? I believe not. I believe justice shouldn't just be for those who can afford it. Justice should be what is morally correct not let's see how much money we can drain from this person as they jump through my hoops. David F Partridge is a fraud and lawyer is the farthest thing from his profession. He is like the snake in the garden of eden. He led my brother astray and made him believe his sinister lies. David told my brother that it would be a clear cut case and he had no chance of spending one day in jail, after a plea bargain had been offered for two years. David was adament and confident in himself that John would not do more than probation and pay a fine. He never once told John that he was facing a minimum of 5 years in prison and upwards to 15 years until John was already cuffed and in custody. My brother lost it all, his car, his job, his life and every joy that he once held. He seems happy between plexi glass and a phone during visits. But I'm his brother I can see through it all. I can tell he wants to cry and let it out but he can't because of where he is. I cry everyday because of these circumstances and how every person who supposedly is out to help him just ends up taking the shoes off his feet and the shirt off his back. Ever since my Father was in a car accident when we were young, he has been mentally challanged as well as wheelchair bound for the rest of his life in a convelecent home, is only in his early 40's and this happened nearly 13 years ago. Ever since the loss of our Father for who he was our lives have gone down hill. My mother tries her best to make ends meet and supports my brother with every penny she could possible manage but it's just not enough to support him (well honestly the ""Justice system"" that asks him for all this money just to be able to have any type of comfort in his life in this hell hole. My brother's life is practically over if things go the way the courts want. I won't see my brother until he's 39, I'll be 34... Everyday I pray for him to be able to make it through this and for some miracle to happen to make this all just go away and I'm at my wits end. My family has very few resources left to offer, we can't even afford to get him paper and envelopes to write us, he can't afford shoes or sweat pants and shirts and he's constantly complaining about how cold it is. This is my brother and I know full heartedly who he is as a person and the justice system doesn't care about who you are you're just another number to them another way to get their daily bread. Well where's my daily bread? I thought this world was supposed to be based on righteousness and goodness, not greed and alterior motives. This whole situation is tearing me apart I've spent many days crying to the point of being dehabilitated. There's days when I can't even get out of bed because I miss my brother so much. He's always been there to protect me and I feel it's my time to try to protect him. We're currently trying to get a new lawyer to help with the case we have soent the last of our resources just for him to look into the case and don't know how to make enough money to pay the rest. I'm literally begging on my hands and knees for a break, just one thing to happen good to turn this thing around but we can't do it on our own. So please won't you help us? If you have any questions about anything that had happened I will be glad to answer them I just don't know where else to turn for help and I know i won't be able to make it 15 years without my brother. It's bad enough we lost our Father at a young age. Our grandparents within a week of eachother and now I'm losing my brother. So please out of the kindness of your heart any amount will help us even if its a few cents we need everything we can get to provide my brother with the proper outfitting to fight this case and atleast lessen his time if not get off completely. I would rather wait two years and get to see him then wait 15 when both of our dreams and already nothing more than dust in the wind. Without him I don't feel like I have any strength to achieve any of my endeavours and without me I know he's dying on the inside. so please even if you can't donate to this cause please spread the word I will be forever grateful and karma is a real thing I may not be able to literally do something incredible for you, but what you give unto others will eventually come back to you.

Hi my name is Justin and I'm reaching out to everyone whos ever been wronged by our so called justice system. My brother, Johnathon, is one of these people. He is incarcerated at the moment due to the incompetancy of his lawyer who had drained him for every penny he had. My brother had broken his back almost literally working weeks on end to come up with the money to pay this lawyer. At the end of the week my brother was lucky to have enough money left over from paying Dave Partridge to buy himself a pack of cigarettes. For months he did this, he had to give up his appartment he had and had to move back in with my mother and I.After John had literally bent over backwards to apease his lawyer and pay him what he had asked for the lawyer still did not do his job. Not one part of the case was handled professionally, if I were a member of the BAR association and could represent my brother I think I could have made a better case for him.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><b>In Expectation of the Thaw</b> began life as an idea.  On the one hand, how could you create a new experience for live audiences, with music that bridged the gap between classical and a more contemporary sound? And how could you incorporate a special visual element to underline the delicate and evocative music?  The goal was simply to reinvigorate the classical music experience around a special and universal theme of our time: Global Warming.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra in Finland commissioned the original work, enabling us to perform the production for the first time in several sold-out concerts and to record the music separately in the superb acoustics of Tampere Hall.  Ever since that recording in 2008, the music has been sitting on hard drives waiting for the right moment and circumstances to mix and produce an album for release.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>More recently, <b>In Expectation of the Thaw</b> was performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall for a special audience of business leaders including HRH Prince Charles.  The performance was a resounding success and the music touched a chord in the audience.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Rather than a handout, what we seek is small investors.  A recording like this could inspire millions of people around the world into feeling compelled to support change in thinking around Climate Change and little lifestyle choices that contribute to the problems.  Given the impact of live performances, this will allow people to enjoy the music at home.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Contemporary composers rarely get the opportunity to realize such a big and ambitious work, and I hope you will consider supporting my development as an artist with an investment in the production of this album and platform for future subsequent productions.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We require a total of $8000 to finish the album of <b>In Expectation of the Thaw</b> and prepare it for release.  This will include approximately 4 weeks of studio time in a high end mixing facility, an experienced engineer and a producer.  The studio and crew work cost $400 per day, with a total of 20 days required.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Anything we receive over $8000 will be used for my personal expenses whilst working on the album including transportation, bills and food.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Unlike many campaigns, I am offering an opportunity for contributors to recoup any money they give with a substantial rate of interest when the recording goes into profit.  This way, rather than a handout, you'll be investing in a product that might just make you money.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In addition, all contributions of $100 or more mean you will receive a numbered, signed limited edition copy of the finished album.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't afford to help with cash, please spread the word to friends and colleagues you feel might enjoy being a part of the launch of something special.  The links above might help get them excited.  Beyond individuals, special opportunities exist for Corporate Sponsors.  Please pass links to people you know in companies that would benefit from this type of international exposure and association.  Every donation adds up quickly to what is really quite a modest sum for a fully mixed orchestral album.</p>

<p>I came up through the UK/US camera department in 16mm and 35mm, 3-D and later to 70mm IMAX production level.  Valuable time was spent as a commercials producer and writer/director with my own UK/US company working globally with major brands.</p>
<p>During living and working in Hollywood for 20 years I became the line producer and location cameraman on the Academy Award winning “Genocide” starring Orson Welles and Elizabeth Taylor.</p>
<p>Director/cameraman for 20th Century Fox on “The Making of Star Wars” in Tunisia and London. Subsequently shot US Public Service commercials for George Lucas using Star Wars R2-D2 &amp; C-3PO.</p>
<p>I have always loved writing for film and the theatre and shall continue to do so. ""Bella's Club Phoenix"" the musical, is especially important to me after researching many of London's street kids and being appalled at their living conditions and the reasons why they left the safety of their homes.</p>
<p>This is a story told with humour and pathos with uplifting song and dance from the street kids as a tribute to their guts and talent for living and performing.</p>
<p>BELLA'S CLUB PHOENIX...STORY LINE</p>
<p>Bella's troubles begin when she buys an abandoned ghetto warehouse in which she intends to create a sophisticated restaurant club. The problem is an unruly crowd of homeless street kids are squatting there and will not move out. Conflict!</p>
<p>Bella having lost her only child, stolen as a babe in arms, decides to take on the street kids and train them up as her staff and give them a home as well. They build the club on stage from found theatrical materials in the warehouse but once the cast erect the club set, the villainous Maître ’d burns it down in revenge for being fired for stealing.</p>
<p>After the interval and the departure of the firemen, Mr Midnight, a bankrupt alcoholic lost soul from the upper classes, reveals a brilliant talent for spray painting graffiti in homage to Picasso and Warhol...the street kids and Bella are pretty good at it as well..these classic paintings will feature in the Gifts and Perks...Bella's Club Phoenix rises from the ashes.</p>
<p>Gangsters and their molls come and go as do established stars from television/film and theater, as guests for a week or so.  The cops make a mock raid and party with inept gangsters and anybody they can handcuff. </p>
<p>Bella's lost child, now one of the street kids is found. Can't tell you how !</p>
<p>All is set for the opening night.</p>
<p>But the invitations have been burnt; none of the celebrities will arrive so selected members of the audience...our funding Angels...are invited on stage for wine and finger food but they have to sing with the cast the last song from the menu.</p>
<p>PERSONAL NOTE</p>
<p>I intend to donate a percentage of any revenue I receive from the stage production to a charity. May I suggest with your contribution you name your favourite charity for consideration.</p>
<p>THIS IS A FOUR TIER FUNDING PROCESS...this is the serious part !</p>
<p>TIER 1. $45,000… THE SCRIPT IS WRITTEN, NOW WE NEED TO CREATE THE MUSIC AND THE PRODUCTION OF THE SHOW CD WHICH WILL ATTRACT THE REST OF THE FUNDING REQUIRED.</p>
<p>TIER 2. $15,000…USE OF CD AND PROMOTION TO SHOW INVESTORS THE CONCEPT.</p>
<p>TIER 3. $75,000… BUDGET, CASTING, SET DESIGN AND EFFECTS OF SHOW.</p>
<p>TIER 4. $250,000… REHEARSAL AND PRODUCTION OF THE FINISHED SHOW</p>
<p>With the first tier of funding in place and the CD completed and optimised as a marketing tool, many areas of investment will open up to complete funding tiers 2, 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Should we not reach our total funding the CD will have fewer songs but will still be a valuable tool for our City investors. </p>
<p>As in the video JOANNE BENJAMIN with The Entertainment Business, an established London stage management company is on board and will be bringing in many professional show investors and venture capitalists. We call them ""Angels"", which of course you are with your contributions.</p>
<p>The potential is an award winning original stage musical that can travel globally as the problems of these street kids can be found in every major city in the world.</p>
<p>We need your help, contributions large and small will get this CD and stage musical on the road. I will of course be e-mailng Progres Reports to you on a weekly basis.  Stand by for Blogs and Tweets as well. We will all have a great time with this project.</p>
<p>Gifts and Perks on the right of this page consist of a series of unique and fun involvements with the cast both on and off the stage once the show is underway.</p>
<p>The CD will be available in all social media outlets as well as autographed art work of the posters and sheet music. Photo opportunities, autographed scripts and other goodies are up for grabs.</p>
<p>All the music Gifts and Perks plus the CD will be available on completion of the CD and the theatre and cast Gifts and Perks will be available once the show is produced. </p>

Thanks.</p>
<p>Should we not reach our required total then the CD will have less songs but I can assure you we will get this show on the road!</p>
<p>I truly understand if you cannot support this campaign. Times are tough but we need music and great stage performances to lighten our world.</p>

After the interval and the departure of the firemen, Mr Midnight, a bankrupt alcoholic lost soul from the upper classes, reveals a brilliant talent for spray painting graffiti in homage to Picasso and Warhol...the street kids and Bella are pretty good at it as well..these classic paintings will feature in the Gifts and Perks...Bella's Club Phoenix rises from the ashes.
Gangsters and their molls come and go as do established stars from television/film and theater, as guests for a week or so.  The cops make a mock raid and party with inept gangsters and anybody they can handcuff. 
Bella's lost child, now one of the street kids is found. Can't tell you how !
All is set for the opening night.
But the invitations have been burnt; none of the celebrities will arrive so selected members of the audience...our funding Angels...are invited on stage for wine and finger food but they have to sing with the cast the last song from the menu.
PERSONAL NOTE
I intend to donate a percentage of any revenue I receive from the stage production to a charity. May I suggest with your contribution you name your favourite charity for consideration.
THIS IS A FOUR TIER FUNDING PROCESS...this is the serious part !
TIER 1. $45,000… THE SCRIPT IS WRITTEN, NOW WE NEED TO CREATE THE MUSIC AND THE PRODUCTION OF THE SHOW CD WHICH WILL ATTRACT THE REST OF THE FUNDING REQUIRED.
TIER 2. $15,000…USE OF CD AND PROMOTION TO SHOW INVESTORS THE CONCEPT.
TIER 3. $75,000… BUDGET, CASTING, SET DESIGN AND EFFECTS OF SHOW.
TIER 4. $250,000… REHEARSAL AND PRODUCTION OF THE FINISHED SHOW
With the first tier of funding in place and the CD completed and optimised as a marketing tool, many areas of investment will open up to complete funding tiers 2, 3 and 4.
Should we not reach our total funding the CD will have fewer songs but will still be a valuable tool for our City investors. 
As in the video JOANNE BENJAMIN with The Entertainment Business, an established London stage management company is on board and will be bringing in many professional show investors and venture capitalists. We call them ""Angels"", which of course you are with your contributions.
The potential is an award winning original stage musical that can travel globally as the problems of these street kids can be found in every major city in the world.
We need your help, contributions large and small will get this CD and stage musical on the road. I will of course be e-mailng Progres Reports to you on a weekly basis.  Stand by for Blogs and Tweets as well. We will all have a great time with this project.
Gifts and Perks on the right of this page consist of a series of unique and fun involvements with the cast both on and off the stage once the show is underway.
The CD will be available in all social media outlets as well as autographed art work of the posters and sheet music. Photo opportunities, autographed scripts and other goodies are up for grabs.
All the music Gifts and Perks plus the CD will be available on completion of the CD and the theatre and cast Gifts and Perks will be available once the show is produced. 
To view Bella’s exclusive video progress reports see http://www.facebook.com/BellasClubPhoenix/app_311253165568475 and of course while you are there please click on the ""like"" button. Thanks.
Should we not reach our required total then the CD will have less songs but I can assure you we will get this show on the road!
I truly understand if you cannot support this campaign. Times are tough but we need music and great stage performances to lighten our world.
As a contributing ""Angel"" or not, be a member, spread the word and share this campaign with family and friends...and with all your clients and social media pals...please ask them to pass it along to their contacts for their consideration.
AND THANK YOU.
PS...Late news...a film production company are suggesting a film should be made. AND...we have a chorographer on board",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I teach at 122nd Street School and I have been at this school for 14 years.  I consider this school my second home and I feel like a part of so many families that I teach.  I am blessed to work with these families and in this community and I feel grateful every day that I get to come to work.  With budget cuts getting worse every year, we don't have the money to fund projects outside of the mandated curriculum.  Here is an opportunity to help a classroom full of excited and eager students get the supplies they need for a photography project. 

In our classroom we learn together, grow together, and support one another.  We often talk about family and what it means to be a part of a family.  Room 20 is a family and I make sure they know that everyday.  For our project, I would like to raise money to buy digital cameras (12) for my classroom.  We have been learning different ways to express ourselves and I think photography is a wonderful way to do it. Pictures do so much more than tell me what is seen, it can help one feel what others feel.  My students are always talking about home, their families, and what they do on the weekends. The concept of home is a powerful thing.  As adults we know it is more than a house, and I want my students to explore all of the personal things that home might mean to them.  I want them to capture the moments that are important to them and turn these moments into stories.  Sharing ones home can be an incredible experience.  Why not give each child a chance to be truly seen and to truly see one another.

Once we have the cameras and the students have taken their pictures, we will have a gallery walk at school to showcase the pictures.  I cannot wait for this night and to see the kids shine!
I ask that you support me in any way you can to help out classroom achieve our fundraising goal.  

Thank you for reading and I am excited to see what happens next!!</div>","My name is Michelle Kirchner and I am a 3rd grade teacher in South LA.

<h3>Hvad er Radio Syndikatet?</h3>
<p>Radio Syndikatet er en ny form for radio, hvor passionen for formidlingen og respekt for den individuelle kultur er i højsædet, uanset om der er tale om Jazz, Hip Hop, Elektronisk, Italo Disco, Dupstep, Drum-n-Bass, Klassisk, ja you name it.</p>
<p>Radio Syndikatets vision er at skabe dynamisk radio i samspil med lytteren, hvor fokus er på det niche præget og særegne, frem for det alt-omfavnende radio man ellers oplever i resten af Danmark.</p>
<p>Hvis man vil læse mere konkret hvad Radio Syndikatet kommer til at tilbyde af programmer og gennem hvilke tjenester, så kan man læse mere på <a href=""http://radiosyndikatet.dk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RadioSyndikatet.dk</a>. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Hvad har vi brug for?</h3>
<p>Radio Syndikatet er en ikke-kommerciel forening, som bliver drevet af ildsjæle som betaler af egen lomme for at lave kvalitetsradio til et nichepræget og ofte meget snævert publikum. <br/><br/>Det er bestemt ikke gratis, og faktisk har vi brug for hver en krone vi kan indsamle, så vi har mulighed for at betale for den daglige drift og udstyr. De indsamlede penge vil blandt andet gå til:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Udstyr:</strong> i form af mikrofoner, lydkort, borde, stole, lys og alt andet et radio studie nu har brug for. Vi har samlet meget selv og arbejder med hvad vi har, men rammerne må også godt være gode, så vi kan levere ordentlig kvalitet til lytterne.</li>
<li>
<strong>Daglig drift:</strong> i form af husleje, KODA/Gramex, webhotel, sende tjeneste etc. Alle drifts udgifter dækkes af Radio Syndikatets egne medlemmer, men det er en dyr post og enhver luft i økonomien vil være tiltrængt, derudover vil det også kunne sikre Radio Syndikatets drift i de næste mange år. </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Hvorfor ""crowd funding""?</strong></h3>
<p>Radio Syndikatet er en ikke-kommerciel radio, som bliver drevet af en ikke-kommerciel forening. Alle bidrag er derfor vigtige, da vi ikke må modtage indtægter i form af reklamer, bannere m.m. i og omkring radioen, hvilket vi bestemt heller ikke ønsker.<br/><br/>Derfor har vi brug for alle de opstartsmidler vi kan skrabe sammen, så vi kan få den bedst mulige start og ballast for en god afvikling.</p>
<p>Så snart Radio Syndikatet er i luften, må vi derudover heller ikke modtage mere end 5000 kr. i indtægter om året, ellers mister vi vores 'ikke-kommercielle' status hos KODA/Gramex og skal betale langt højere satser, heldigvis må vi dog starte med den start-kapital vi selv har til rådighed, og DERFOR er crowd-funding en perfekt løsning for os og dem som ønsker at støtte et fantastisk projekt... plus man får en masse seje ""perks"" selvfølgelig :-)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Hvilken betydning vil Radio Syndikatet have?</h3>
<p>Radio Syndikatet vil betyde at det ikke kun er de samme 2-3 aktører som dikterer hvordan den niche præget musik/debat skal formidles. Radio Syndikatet vil i videst muligt omfang søge at levere top kvalitet, uden at gå på kompromis med indholdet i en jagt på lyttere, vi vil behandle hvert program med samme entusiasme og dedikation, hvad enten der er tale om 10 eller 10.000 lyttere.</p>
<p>Det mener vi er tiltrængt, i en radio verden hvor vi selv har ledt og ledt efter netop de programmer som kunne levere det indhold vi selv efterlyste, og nu har vi endelig fundet en løsning... vi laver det nemlig bare selv.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Hvordan kan du ellers hjælpe?</h3>
<p>Det er ikke alle som har mulighed for at hjælpe økonomisk, men det er ikke kun penge vi har brug for. Vi har også brug for opbakning, omtale, udstyr m.m., her er et par måder du også kan hjælpe:</p>

<h3></h3>We want the album to reflect the time and care that
went into every song. To that end we are going to RSL studios (used by Sony
BMG and EMI artists etc) to get a professionally recorded and mixed album to
share with the world. Think of it as buying the album before it is made on good
faith that it will be worth listening to! Basically we are offering 4 lifetimes of experience and musical training distilled into an album with 10-12 songs. <br/>Musical communication means everything to us but without something to listen to there can be no communication, this album can't be made the way we want it to without your support!<br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/FDmgT3-Vxw4?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<h2>Costs<br/>
</h2>
<p>Naturally
a lot more goes into making an album than just good recordings of the songs,
your donations will be used to pay for:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Studio
time</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Mixing</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Mastering</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Artwork</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Design</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Photography</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>CD/Vinyl
production costs</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Digital
distribution</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Travel
to and from the studio</p>
<p>We are setting the target at €4000
as this is the absolute minimum amount we believe we need to spend to make a
good job of the album. Anything we make above and beyond that will be used to
improve the album with extra studio time and mixing work and for exciting
extras like limited edition vinyl versions and maybe even a professional music
video if you are particularly generous with your donations!!! Rest assured
every cent that you donate will go towards generating content for you!</p>
<p>What’s that you say? “I really want
this album to get made but don’t have much money”? Of course we musicians are
very sensitive to the penniless, so even if you can only afford a small
donation it’s a huge help if you post this link all over your social networks,
the more people that know about this the better!</p>
<p><b><u>How to donate</u></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Browse your way through the list of carefully considered and attractive perks
     on the right until you see one that tickles your fancy and then click on
     it.</li>
<li>You will be taken to a page where you have
     the option of paying more for your chosen perk should you so wish, then simply
     fill out your email address and postal address (shipping for those of you
     from the US) if you have chosen a perk that needs to be sent to you and
     click “continue”</li>
<li>The payment page requires a credit card or
     paypal account, fill out your details and then click “contribute” or “go
     to paypal”…… you know…… depending on how you want to pay.</li>
<li>Once you are done you will be transported
     to the sharing page by the magic of the internet. Here you will see a
     summary of your contribution and perk and then we would LOVE you to tell
     all your social networks and email contacts about our efforts! This is
     just as important as contributing because if people don’t know what we are
     up to then they can’t choose to help. We will be giving away amazing prizes to the people who generate the most donations by sharing their personal link to our site. Check out the updates tab at the top for details!<br/>

faith that it will be worth listening to! Basically we are offering 4 lifetimes of experience and musical training distilled into an album with 10-12 songs. Musical communication means everything to us but without something to listen to there can be no communication, this album can't be made the way we want it to without your support!


Costs

Naturally
a lot more goes into making an album than just good recordings of the songs,
your donations will be used to pay for:
· 
Studio
time
· 
Mixing
· 
Mastering
· 
Artwork
· 
Design
· 
Photography
· 
CD/Vinyl
production costs
· 
Digital
distribution
· 
Travel
to and from the studio
We are setting the target at €4000
as this is the absolute minimum amount we believe we need to spend to make a
good job of the album. Anything we make above and beyond that will be used to
improve the album with extra studio time and mixing work and for exciting
extras like limited edition vinyl versions and maybe even a professional music
video if you are particularly generous with your donations!!! Rest assured
every cent that you donate will go towards generating content for you!
What’s that you say? “I really want
this album to get made but don’t have much money”? Of course we musicians are
very sensitive to the penniless, so even if you can only afford a small
donation it’s a huge help if you post this link all over your social networks,
the more people that know about this the better!

Avec le livre-disque Déversement d'huiles, notre huitième Opus, on veut sortir de nos propres sentiers battus et amener l'univers des Chauffeurs à pieds ailleurs le temps d'un projet! L'essentiel de ce que l'on vous prépare pour ce projet a été créé pendant ou inspiré par une expédition en canot de 21 jours sur la rivière Moisie faite par le groupe en 2013.
Cette expédition a marqué un point tournant dans la carrière du groupe, ou à tout le moins une parenthèse créatrice, teintée d'expérimentations musicales et poétiques. Cette aventure a aussi donné lieu a un spectacle encore en chantier, présenté au Musée de la Civilisation à Québec l'hiver dernier.
Ce projet a poussé le groupe à repousser ses limites et à amener la musique traditionnelle québécoise vers de nouveaux horizons, pas nécessairement très commerciaux: c'est entre autre pour cette raison que nous avons besoin de votre aide!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have been a professional musician for nearly forty years, starting with Bauhaus and then Love and Rockets as well as a stint with The Jazz Butcher.  I have been playing solo gigs since 1983. For the past few years I’ve been playing an ongoing series of ‘living room shows’.  These intimate gatherings have taken me into peoples’ homes all over the world.  The experience is always warm and soul satisfying and I love that it cuts out the middle man so that I can deal directly with the fans /music lovers.  While out on the road I have been writing new songs inspired by these troubadour adventures.  I am now bringing these new works together as a double vinyl album.  I have already made a bunch of recordings.  These sessions having been funded by my Patreon site which has proved to be an invaluable interface with the fans and their support has been truly appreciated.  It’s about half way there and I now need to complete the project and then take it on the road.  I want to tour internationally in support of the new album in the Spring / Summer of 2017.   In these days of DIY independence, 'crowd sourcing' platforms (such as here at Indiegogo ) are now the all important factor that enables independent artists such as myself to function and thrive.  It is a reciprocal system that also creates a familial bond which is something that lies at the heart of the acoustic 'living room' shows.</p>
<p>The remainder of the recordings will be done at a great little musician run studio in Los Angeles. I have several wonderful musicians in mind to play on the tracks.  Once the record is recorded and mastered it will be manufactured as a limited edition of 500 double vinyl albums.  (I love that vinyl has made such a come back!  Nothing can beat that sound in my book and there is nothing like holding a beautiful gatefold sleeve in your hands and pouring over the art work as you listen to the music inside.  I have a great designer who I will be working with on this.)   I am confident that the record will be made but the biggest challenge will be taking it on the road, especially as I want to tour outside of my home in the USA.  International travel is not cheap.  If I do not hit my goal of $8000 then I will simply have to scale it all back and limit touring to the USA but hopefully I will be able to be a vagabond abroad as well as here!  'Hope to see you somewhere out there!</p>

<h3>What is Philippi Music Project?</h3>
<p>PMP started in<strong> July 2014 as a social business</strong> aiming at <strong>offering infrastructure to aspiring artists and musicians from the townships of Cape Town</strong>. More than just a recording studio, the place works like a platform <strong>connected to Cape Town 's music industry</strong> and creates meaningful interactions between musicians, record labels, streaming platforms, venues, media and so much more. <strong>Workshops, conferences, concerts, recording sessions</strong> will make this place a classroom to express creativity, connect people and learn from Music.</p>
<p>We <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/philippi-music-project-studio/x/11146141#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">crowdfunded</a> the building of the studio in 2016, and <strong>the construction completed in March 2017</strong>, after three months of hard work involving local suppliers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491753348/nboglud8etsuwzxzsxox.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The studio will open in a very short while, as we are now <strong>working with a sound engineer to develop the most functional set up for local artists</strong>. PMP received a <strong>great media coverage that brought beautiful interactions,</strong> making the project more impactful.</p>
<p>We received a team of students from the<strong> </strong><a href=""http://wp.wpi.edu/southafrica/projects/2016-projects/philippi-music-project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Worcester Polytechnic Institute</strong> </a> of Massachusetts to develop a<strong> mobile app for our artists to promote their content and events</strong>, we organized a great event with the people from<strong> <a href=""http://recordbox-sessions.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Recordbox Sessions</a> </strong>that enables to <strong>promote local artists</strong>, we worked with a team of French reporters on a <strong>documentary about the music and its impact through social innovation</strong> (the documentary will be out soon), and it keeps on moving as we will soon host<strong> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Musicforphilippi/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">two students</a> from the IDEA program of the EM Lyon School</strong> to help in recording an album with local artists.</p>
<p>These <strong>partnerships are key for PMP</strong> as they broaden its impact and enable the promotion of local artists from the townships of Cape Town. <strong>The Modular Festival represents for us an even bigger opportunity, to go further in our impact.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491754002/rq2buqnzzbhauk3ggl7v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>What is the Modular Festival?</h3>
<p>The<a href=""http://modular-festival.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a><a href=""https://vimeo.com/169232213"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Modular Festival </a>is organised by the city of Augsburg´s youth council and is <strong>one of the biggest non-profit youth and popcultural festivals in Bavaria (Germany)</strong> – however, it´s much more than this!</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/169232213?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Around <strong>30.000 visitors on three days</strong>, more than <strong>50 artists and bands more than 30 programme planers from various youth cultural genres</strong>, a regional food court and a <strong>creative market with young designers</strong> – the Modular has established itself as a platform for Augsburg´s youth, designers, artists and culture lovers. </p>
<p><strong>Philippi Music Project has been invited to present its social innovation at the festival</strong>, through <strong>interactive presentation</strong>, and a <strong>collaborative workshop</strong> where visitors will be able to record music that will be <strong>used later by local music producers from the townships of Cape Town to do an EP</strong>. PMP will also <strong>perform during the festival on the main stage</strong>, as PMP's two co-founders are MC &amp; DJ. They will offer a <strong>100% South African Beats set, to promote the amazing music coming out from SA.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why does PMP need to go to the Modular Festival? </strong></h3>
<p>The Modular Festival will mean so much for us, as we will be able to<strong> promote the local and aspiring artists from the townships of Cape Town</strong>. It will mean so much for us, because we will be able to <strong>promote this music towards a big crowd,</strong> building <strong>bridges between artists that are not connected enough to the industry and people who will discover the richness and creativity of these musicians. </strong></p>

</div></div>","What is Philippi Music Project?
PMP started in July 2014 as a social business aiming at offering infrastructure to aspiring artists and musicians from the townships of Cape Town. More than just a recording studio, the place works like a platform connected to Cape Town 's music industry and creates meaningful interactions between musicians, record labels, streaming platforms, venues, media and so much more. Workshops, conferences, concerts, recording sessions will make this place a classroom to express creativity, connect people and learn from Music.
We crowdfunded the building of the studio in 2016, and the construction completed in March 2017, after three months of hard work involving local suppliers.

The studio will open in a very short while, as we are now working with a sound engineer to develop the most functional set up for local artists. PMP received a great media coverage that brought beautiful interactions, making the project more impactful.
We received a team of students from the Worcester Polytechnic Institute  of Massachusetts to develop a mobile app for our artists to promote their content and events, we organized a great event with the people from Recordbox Sessions that enables to promote local artists, we worked with a team of French reporters on a documentary about the music and its impact through social innovation (the documentary will be out soon), and it keeps on moving as we will soon host two students from the IDEA program of the EM Lyon School to help in recording an album with local artists.
These partnerships are key for PMP as they broaden its impact and enable the promotion of local artists from the townships of Cape Town. The Modular Festival represents for us an even bigger opportunity, to go further in our impact.


 
What is the Modular Festival?
The Modular Festival is organised by the city of Augsburg´s youth council and is one of the biggest non-profit youth and popcultural festivals in Bavaria (Germany) – however, it´s much more than this!

Around 30.000 visitors on three days, more than 50 artists and bands more than 30 programme planers from various youth cultural genres, a regional food court and a creative market with young designers – the Modular has established itself as a platform for Augsburg´s youth, designers, artists and culture lovers. 
Philippi Music Project has been invited to present its social innovation at the festival, through interactive presentation, and a collaborative workshop where visitors will be able to record music that will be used later by local music producers from the townships of Cape Town to do an EP. PMP will also perform during the festival on the main stage, as PMP's two co-founders are MC & DJ. They will offer a 100% South African Beats set, to promote the amazing music coming out from SA.
 
Why does PMP need to go to the Modular Festival? 
The Modular Festival will mean so much for us, as we will be able to promote the local and aspiring artists from the townships of Cape Town. It will mean so much for us, because we will be able to promote this music towards a big crowd, building bridges between artists that are not connected enough to the industry and people who will discover the richness and creativity of these musicians. 

It will also be for PMP the opportunity to present its project, its social innovation, and to meet relevant stakeholders in the media and the music industry. People is power, and meeting new actors in the game will empower our project, as it has always been the case for the past 3 years.
Eventually, this invitation is the first time that PMP will go physically abroad, and we hope that it will bring others opportunity. Eventually we hope to be able to tour with local artists using our studio in Cape Town...

<p>I'm very excited to be starting an album with a producing/engineering team of two dear friends—John Hanson and Dan Ballard! John has played guitar for Christina Perri for the last few years and is currently producing in Los Angeles. Dan Ballard, in his previous band Until June, had a number one song in Greece. He is currently producing in Orange County. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For friends who don't understand how albums are put together and why it's costly, I've included some of the steps in the process. Each step is necessary and takes years to acquire each specific skill. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Songwriter:</strong> </p>
<p>Songs can take a long time to write! I try to complete one song a month. Sometimes I'll chip away at a song for a whole year until I think it's right. I care about lyrics and the musical details that go into storytelling: chord progressions, melody, and structure. I will spend hours a day slowly building on the story. I've been doing this for two decades. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Believe it or not, last year I made less than $20 a month on streaming music alone—on thousands and thousands of plays. Most people don't know that each time you stream an album on Spotify or another service, the artist only makes $.006. That's a lot of plays until I would even make a penny. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is why it takes a team of people partnering with me to continue to make music and tell these stories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Players:</strong></p>
<p>Rhythm sections (drummers and bass players) and other players take a lifetime to develop the skills for their instruments. There is no replacing these players. We will play guitar, keys, and sing on this record, but we will also have some other people ""guest"", because that's what makes music interesting. When you have a lot of people sharing ideas. Each player is paid per song. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Producer:</strong> </p>
<p>This is where the ""shaping"" of each song happens. The possibilities of where a song could go are endless. A single song could have an infinite amount of different combinations of instruments and styles. When you hear a song on most records, hundreds of decisions went into each instrument and part of the song. Should we go with this drum fill or this one? Is the bass too busy on this take? What instruments do you hear on this? Many producers are fantastic musicians that can arrange parts. It takes years and years to acquire the skills to produce well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Engineer:</strong></p>
<p>This has to do with the mic'ing of different instruments, getting tones, and an overall aesthetic of what the album sounds like. Again, there are endless combinations of each instrument, the tones desired, and the knowledge of how these will work together later for the mix. A good engineer also has a great knowledge for troubleshooting gear when it isn't working. Most people don't know how common it is to have sound problems in the studio and the time it takes to figure out why something isn't working. Does this guitar sound too ""boomy""? Do you think we can get a better snare sound? How do we get these two guitars to not share the same mid-range space? Again, this skill takes many years to get good at.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mixer:</strong></p>
<p>This is the last ""player"" on the album. Good mixers take decades learning their craft and have fantastic ears. They learn how to meticulously make all of the instruments work together to make a final painting. I've watched people who weren't musicians listen to the same song mixed by a few different people. They were amazed at the difference one step in the recording process can make. Mixing can be really expensive and you definitely get what you pay for. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Master:</strong></p>
<p>The final step of recording. This is where slight adjustments to the tones and volumes are brought to similar levels so the album sounds cohesive. It's a skill that takes time to learn. Even though it's one of the most inexpensive steps, with a deal (favor from a friend) it would still cost about $1,500 for a 10-song album.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Artwork and Layout:</strong></p>
<p>My dear friend and talented painter, Ryan Callis, has provided me with both of my previous album covers. Another dear friend, Ralph Polendo, an angel in my corner and a really gifted designer, helped me with this video and will handle any of my design needs. </p>

<p><strong>BoogieBike</strong> is a new musical venture from <a href=""http://www.djmanogil.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DJ Mano Gil</a> to spread the joy of music to the many public spaces in San Luis Obispo and nearby towns. The project consists of a sound system (2 turntables + mixer + speakers) adapted to a customized E3 GO E-Trike that plays only vinyl records. </p>
<p>The concept of the BoogieBike is to offer music for people in public spaces such as parks, squares, or even sidewalks. The volume and the selection of songs are adapted to the people's mood and the environment, ranging from jazz, bossa nova, soul, salsa, and other family friendly rhythms. An extra motivation for the creation of BoogieBike is the fact that, being originally from Brazil, Mano Gil will be able share  his collection of Brazilian music with the town he now calls home. </p>

<p>The majority of BoogieBike gigs will be free and outdoors. It will count on the participation of local guest DJs and it will also serve as a mobile DJ school for the young generations that still can’t come to the evening events. As a teacher on his daytime job, Mano Gil loves sharing his musical knowledge with the future generation of DJs, helping inspire their passion for music and contributing in developing SLO’s multi-cultural scene.</p>

<p>Our project was inspired by a similar project from Montreal, Canada called Tupicycle. One can even say that these are sister projects as Mano Gil became close friends with the creators of Tupicycle; DJs Skambo and MKS, on his last visit to Montreal in 2016.

<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>San Luis Obispo is one of the most bike friendly cities in America. It has several public spaces that are not always used to their full potential at times. This project aims to provide an extra bit of diversity to our already vibrant music scene by bringing music to where people are. </p>
<p>We expect the impact to be almost immediate. People of all ages a social walks will be able to congregate, meet new friends, build new community relationships and share the public spaces in a healthy and rich way. </p>
<p>Without being pretentious, we also hope to inspire other people in other parts of the world to build similar projects in their town. We're living in times when the more you know your neighbor the more we can understand and appreciate each other. Music can be help create those bridges and strengthen the community as a whole. Just like we we were inspired by the guys from TupiCollective and their Tupicycle in Montreal we would like to spread the love and do the same here in SLO.</p>

(Check them out in the ""Perks"" section of the main page.) The album itself is still very new but my hope is that it will be named ""Always Looking Up"" after a song that will be on the record. It is my motto for life, and even though I allow for those dark feelings to come and move through me, my disposition is always set to happy and gracious. Life has not always been an easy ride and I've been stuck in low, low places. Upon choosing happiness as an everyday goal,  life has given me such good things in return. And I know now that I am worthy of all good things. And so are you. The album touches on that topic as well as love and lessons learned. Again, thank you from all corners of my heart for your support. It means SO much to me that you are willing to help fund this journey with (blind, if you don't know me) faith. I truly hope you enjoy!Love, Krista J.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

interdisciplinary performance presenting live music dance and videomapping projections. <br/><br/>The music will 
transition between early western classical music and Mexican (and 
Latin-American) traditional music, considering their historical and 
stylistic influences on one another and making the combination 
harmonically and instrumentally logical and tasteful.<br/><br/>It also 
suggests relationships between all kinds of “classical” music (mainly 
vocal repertoire) and its text and popular/folk music, by using unusual 
instrumentation to accompany vocal music (opera/zarzuela arias and 
duets, oratorio arias/ensembles, polyphony and songs from the 
Renaissance to the 20th century). The use of instruments such as harp, 
accordion, jaranas, guitar, marimbol, marimba, etc., would substitute 
for the original orchestration and then 
transition into folk music, so that the two styles would mirror each 
other.<br/><br/>Initially the popular music side will emphasize Mexican Son Jarocho music from Veracruz in partnership with amazing group Radio Jarocho.<br/><br/>This
 show is intended to have its opening in New York City and in Union 
City, NJ in 2016 and then go to different countries. The emphasis on 
Mexican Son Jarocho is partially because it has a close stylistic and 
historical relationship with Baroque and Renaissance music from Europe 
(especially Spain), but is also for the purpose of exposing and 
promoting this music. In comparison with the Mariachi genre, for 
instance, the style is not well known outside of Mexico, even in some 
Latin American countries.<br/><br/>The use of aerial dancing will also be incorporated into these performances.<br/></p><p>As
 a part of the interdisciplinary concept, the use of multi-media 
resources such as stage projections of images and films will be done on a
 series of white fabrics hanging around the performers to create the 
scenery. Paintings and sculpture by various artists will appear in the 
promotion, logo, website and stage as well.<br/></p>One of the goals is to 
achieve a new level of interaction between performers and audience and 
between performers themselves, from different stylistic backgrounds. By 
including popular musicians in classical music concerts, and following 
the steps of exposition (of separate styles), transition (between 
styles) and then potentially fusion, the relationship between styles, 
texts, and ways of making music will be illuminated, inviting and 
including a wider community of different genres and disciplines into the
 same performances to establish cultural bridges.<br/><br/>Improvisation and jamming with everyone on stage is also intended.<br/><br/>The
 logo of the name “Mexamorphosis” or “Mexamorfosis” (in Latin America) 
will include works by Jesus Peraza, a Mexican artist from Yucatán.<br/><br/>Eventually, this project envisions encompassing not only Mexican and Latin-American music and traditions, but also music and traditions from around the world.<p><br/></p><p><strong>Mexamorphosis</strong> is scheduled to be presented at the ""Cross Cultural Approaches to

Heritage Month Concert at the Union City Performing Arts Center on 
October 15, 2016.<br/><br/><strong>All of the above performances will be free to the public.</strong><br/><br/>The
 performances have great educational and social value, as they exhibit a
 diversity of classical music genres, particularly opera, early music, 
and art song, and, at the same time, illuminate the close stylistic and 
historical relationship of these genres with popular music from 
countries that have been historically influenced by Western European 
cultures even while developing independent societies and artistic 
practices. The performances also promote and exhibit Mexican music and 
traditions, especially those like Son Jarocho which are not well known 
outside of Mexico.<br/><br/>The illumination of the relationship between

</div></div>","Hi!
We are MonkingMe, a new music platform that allows you to listen to and download music for free, while the artists are paid for it. We link the music content from the artists with their concerts and merchandising in the same place. In this way, the fans will be aware of all the news from their favourite musicians.
The artists can select some options to download their songs:

Free download

Free download, in exchange for a user's like to the artist's profile

Free download, in exchange for viewing 20 seconds of a video made by the same artist

Free download and REMUNERATED, in exchange for viewing 20 seconds of a video ad

You have read well! It will always be free! And artists will promote their other income channels like concerts and merchandising or artists will be remunerated in a fair and transparent way for each paid download. And you, as a user, will never hear any ads in the streaming!

<p>I’m excited about returning to the big power ballads I’ve
been known for through the years. There’s always the temptation in music to be
the latest, hippest sounding artist.</p>
<p>But reality grips me now in my sixties and I actually find
my audience hasn’t left. There was an era of music that was deep and profound with
great lyrics that captured the glory of the Gospel.</p>
<p>I enjoy much of today’s music but long for the roots of my
past. It’s like going back and listening to the groups and artists we grew up
with. There’s a deep connection. </p>
<p>As I’ve thought and prayed through this next album project,
The Balladeer, I want to combine the fresh sounds of today with the big power
ballad style I did for years.</p>
<p>Some of the other songs on this new CD are love songs I’ve
written for my wife and kids as well as the journey of looking more like my
parents as I age!</p>
<p>But most of all they are a passionate expression of my
journey in Christ and a heart that longs to look like him!</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration of joining me in this journey! I can't do it without you!</p>

When it debuted in 2011, A Day In The Life played to sold-out houses and created an unprecedented buzz in the midcoast summer scene. 

That's why we're thrilled to announce that we are taking the show on the road in 2016.  This newly-cast production features some of New England’s finest musicians, which makes A Day in the Life: A Beatles Experience the ONLY complete Beatles retrospective on the East Coast comprised entirely of Beatle-aged performers.
Utilizing newly-acquired replica instruments, including Paul McCartney’s iconic Hofner bass, George Harrison’s legendary Gretsch workhorse and painted Rocky Stratocaster, John Lennon’s classic Gibson acoustic and Epiphone Casino, and Ringo’s Starr’s pearl-finish drum set, the five-person cast recreate over thirty Beatles classics completely live. Three video screens showing vintage multimedia, coupled with five costume changes comprised of stitch-for-stitch authentic pieces create an awe-inspiring homage to pop music’s most influential band.

Featuring classics like...
I Want To Hold Your Hand • Twist and Shout • Yesterday •
Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band • I Am the Walrus
• She Loves You • Come Together • Let It Be

<h2 class=""p1"">UPDATE: Hello wonderful people, So I know it’s been a super long time since my last update, and I’m deeply sorry but It’s only because I’ve been working non-stop and making you proud. </h2>
<h2 class=""p1"">Now, It would be rather easy for me to just say everything’s in order and things are off to a flying start. But since so many of you wonderful souls have so graciously invested in me, I’ve decided to document this process every step of the way. Partly for posterity, but mostly to serve as evidence.This series is being shot by the ever-so-awesome and talented photographer Ekta Saran, who is obviously on something, as she has agreed to spend copious amounts of hours with Reiner and I in our tiny little studio. But, worry not. We plan on feeding her from time to time.</h2>
<h2 class=""p1"">Committing all these moments to film, memory card rather, has given this album a whole new dimension. This is the first of a series of webisodes documenting the making of the album.Through this series you’ll see recording sessions with some amazing sessionists, choir recordings, collaborations with visual artists making the album artwork, teasers of the songs on the album, an indepth look into the production of the album and loads of studio footage with goof ups, one-take successes and the occasional heated arguement in pajamas.</h2>
<h2 class=""p1"">So I hope you’ll stay with me and send me your comments through it all.</h2>
<h2 class=""p1"">Webisode 1:Shot by Ekta Saran. <a href=""http://www.ektasaran.com%C2%A0Edited"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ektasaran.com Edited</a> by Gayathri, Music from ‘Our Little Thing’ on the upcoming album, Produced by Reiner Erlings.</h2>
<h2 class=""p1"">WATCH: Making of - Part 1: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUTBLqbLGlk&amp;list=FLrTTw9hsxqfc06RRRCK1Q0w&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video&amp;hd=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUTBLqbLGlk&amp;...</a>    </h2>
<h2 class=""p1""> </h2>
<h3 class=""p1"">Hi I'm Gayathri and I need your support to independently release my debut album this winter. </h3>
<h3 class=""p1""><em>Many of you have my last single &amp; EP, and I'm super excited to report that I'm in the pre-production stages of my first full-length album. This is a major step for me, as I believe this album will not only define my voice as an artist but will be an ode to all the moments and people that inspire me to write songs. Over the last year, I have written songs that I'm proud of and that I believe represent a cohesive body of work. They've taken a lot out of me (in a great way), and I'm looking forward to sharing them with you. But to get them from my mouth to your ears, I need your help! </em></h3>

</div></div>","UPDATE: Hello wonderful people, So I know it’s been a super long time since my last update, and I’m deeply sorry but It’s only because I’ve been working non-stop and making you proud. 
Now, It would be rather easy for me to just say everything’s in order and things are off to a flying start. But since so many of you wonderful souls have so graciously invested in me, I’ve decided to document this process every step of the way. Partly for posterity, but mostly to serve as evidence.This series is being shot by the ever-so-awesome and talented photographer Ekta Saran, who is obviously on something, as she has agreed to spend copious amounts of hours with Reiner and I in our tiny little studio. But, worry not. We plan on feeding her from time to time.
Committing all these moments to film, memory card rather, has given this album a whole new dimension. This is the first of a series of webisodes documenting the making of the album.Through this series you’ll see recording sessions with some amazing sessionists, choir recordings, collaborations with visual artists making the album artwork, teasers of the songs on the album, an indepth look into the production of the album and loads of studio footage with goof ups, one-take successes and the occasional heated arguement in pajamas.
So I hope you’ll stay with me and send me your comments through it all.
Webisode 1:Shot by Ekta Saran. www.ektasaran.com Edited by Gayathri, Music from ‘Our Little Thing’ on the upcoming album, Produced by Reiner Erlings.
WATCH: Making of - Part 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUTBLqbLGlk&...    
 
Hi I'm Gayathri and I need your support to independently release my debut album this winter. 
Many of you have my last single & EP, and I'm super excited to report that I'm in the pre-production stages of my first full-length album. This is a major step for me, as I believe this album will not only define my voice as an artist but will be an ode to all the moments and people that inspire me to write songs. Over the last year, I have written songs that I'm proud of and that I believe represent a cohesive body of work. They've taken a lot out of me (in a great way), and I'm looking forward to sharing them with you. But to get them from my mouth to your ears, I need your help! 
I will be acting as my own record label, and there's thousands of dollars/pounds/rupees worth of costs associated with recording, producing, packaging and promoting this album. It helps that I have so much faith in the musicians I'll be working with, because I know in my heart, that we will create something that you will be proud to be a part of.  I will be recording parts of the album in the UK & India - working with a diverse array of amazing musicians.

<h3>Hi,</h3>
<p>I'm Naomi Psalm a singer/songwriter from Florida and living in Boise, Idaho...I used to ride a unicycle and I used to drive a bright pink '67 VW bug. That may be all you need to know about me.</p>
<p>.....I'm a girl who has had a passion for music since age 8. I feel things deeply, and I go crazy if I am not creating whether it be music or art. I am continuously driven to keep performing and making music largely because of YOU! For the people that smile when they hear it, for the kids that tug at their dad's shirts to stop and hear the music. For the joy it brings, for the thoughts it provokes, for the days it enhances.</p>
<p>I am hitting the studio early Sept., 2012 to record some new songs. This will be my 5th project, and I can't wait to share it with you!</p>
<p>I cannot begin to explain how much your support would mean to me...even if it is a small amount...even if you cannot help financially, but in the way of making some noise about this campaign.  Sharing this with your friends will be a huge help!</p>
<p>If my goal of $3,200 is not reached, I will still finish the project though I may have to push the date back.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I’m
Bill Bryson and I volunteer at Grow Radio, a volunteer-run, non-profit, community
internet radio station broadcasting live from downtown Gainesville, FL.<br/>
I got my start in radio in college at WXYC in Chapel Hill, NC. After running a
live music club in Gainesville for years without radio support for independent
bands, I decided to start a radio station that would play anything that current
FM stations in our area don’t play, with an emphasis on a deep interest in a
variety of music, providing diverse content, with dedicated community members making
community-driven content.</p>
<p>After
spending time in communities with high quality, alternative, community radio
it’s apparent what a valuable cultural niche such a station fills in a
community. Grow Radio was established to fill that niche in Gainesville.</p>
Your contributions will enable Grow Radio to expand our programming
assortment by providing much needed resources to purchase equipment, expand our
community outreach, and continue to provide the great, locally-generated
content that enriches our community and culture.<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our funding
needs are significant as we have established this station from the ground up.
With generous material and financial donations to get things started we have
come this far, but to continue to grow our operation we have further material
needs. These needs include funds to purchase otherwise unattainable music for
our music library. We also need equipment to enable volunteers to create new
programming including two video cameras, a field recorder, a mixing board,
microphones, stands, cables, software, a MacBook laptop, and headphones. Funds
will also be used to upgrade studio equipment. The contributions will enable
Grow Radio to expand programming variety and quality immediately. Volunteers
will have the opportunity to attain new skills, producing vibrant shows and
features </p>
<p>Our rewards
have been organized to showcase Gainesville, our creative artists, artisans and
businesses in the community. Many are one-of-a-kind items produced specifically
for this campaign. By supporting Grow Radio in this campaign you are getting a
piece of Gainesville as well as ensuring the ongoing and expanding programming
of Grow Radio.</p>
<p>Rewards can be viewed on our blog at: <a href=""http://growradio.wordpress.com/2013/09/23/indie-go-go-rewards/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://growradio.wordpress.com/2013/09/23/indie...</a></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The station benefits the
community on several levels. It is both educational and informational. It provides
the new music that informed listeners demand. Local music is highly valued and
given significant airtime and, in doing so, we provide a vital component in a
thriving local music culture.  Grow Radio
offers an unconventional platform for community members to get directly involved
in local media. Volunteers are comprised of students and faculty from the University of Florida and Santa Fe Community College as well as non-affiliated music lovers in the community. Live
radio offers the DJs an opportunity to connect directly to their listening
audience, with a variety of personality and color, ultimately celebrating the
diversity of our community. Listeners tired of the dominant commercialized
generic programming of contemporary FM radio crave the connection available in
Grow Radio’s live DJ broadcast. It’s a more personal listening experience,
without commercials, that nurtures the unexpected, keeping things fresh and the
listeners on their toes. There’s no substitute for a live DJ playing music they
are passionate about for a receptive audience. It’s something that can’t be standardized, computed and replicated. It’s something that has all
but disappeared from the contemporary FM listening experience outside of traditional college radio. The difference
is immediate and welcome and we believe the experience of live radio to be
invaluable.</p>
<p>Grow Radio volunteers experience an
environment that is ripe for exploration, discovery and sharing. Consequently
it fosters new ideas, new connections, and ultimately new rewards for the
listening community. By helping Grow Radio in this campaign you are contributing
to the overall cultural health of the community. The arts are not merely a
luxury item in society. They are the lifeblood of creativity, problem-solving
and benefit a community in essential ways.</p>
<p>Internet radio is getting easier and
easier to use. We have an iPhone app for Grow Radio. Great internet radio apps
like TuneIn.com also enable easy listening. There are also several advantages
to internet radio otherwise unavailable with FM. The listener is not bound by a time
schedule for programming on Grow Radio. Podcasts are available for every show
and thus are available at any convenient time for the listener. Video content
can be incorporated through various web platforms, providing the opportunity to
provide additional unique content. We can also enhance connection to Gainesville
from afar. Internet availability provides listeners the opportunity to maintain
connection to the radio station and consequently, to the town.</p>
<p>FM is currently the dominant
media, but internet radio is the future. With Grow Radio we put Gainesville
first. Our focus and identity is local-352, GNV, swampy, north Florida local.
We play for a local audience, but the internet offers global accessibility.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p></p>
<p>If you can’t contribute
financially, there are other things you can do to help Grow Radio in this
campaign. </p>
<p>We accept donations of material
goods including CD players, turntables, computers, LP/CD collections, and other
audio/broadcast equipment. Grow Radio is a 501 (c) (3) organization and your donation may qualify for a tax deduction.</p>

<p>A critical part of my vision for this album is to release it as a limited edition full length Vinyl LP, as well as a digital release.  Vinyl copies will include a digital download card.  The approach to recording was carefully conceived to capture a broad and colorful dynamic sound spectrum, in high fidelity, and it is my feeling that a vinyl listening experience will represent the album's fullest sonic potential.</p>
<p>The album has been recorded and mixed over the last year, together with my friend Ron Russell, without whom this project could not have been realized; it was through Ron's generosity and encouragement that a full album of unaccompanied saxophone performances developed, being recorded and mixed over a number of sessions.</p>
<p><i>Red in the Missile Room</i> is comprised of twelve tracks, each of them performed by myself on tenor or soprano saxophone, recorded live and without overdubs.  The tracks vary in approach, from lyrical and angular melodies to 'sound based' multiphonic thematic improvisations.  The common thread is a grounding in the present moment, bringing together the experiences of performer and listener in an intimate way.  I feel like this album represents a largely unexplored part of my musical personality, as cultivated over the last couple of years, and I'm so excited to share it with you and others!</p>
<p>Now the album needs to be mastered and released in a way that best represents the spirit of the recordings, and for that I need your help!  To nicely master the recordings for digital and vinyl, cut the lacquers, and press the records I'll need to raise at least $3000 through this campaign.</p>
<p>That means if just 30 people give $100 each, this album will be made.  Any donation will help.  <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">To further incentivize your contribution today I am offering these special perks:</span></p>
<p>Rewards</p>
<p>*$25 Donation- You will get a copy of the Vinyl LP w/ digital download card (includes US shipping or pickup at record release show).  You will also be listed as a funding contributor on the album’s liner notes!</p>
<p>*$100 Donation- above rewards PLUS personal saxophone performance ringtone for your phone.</p>

<h3>Brief intro of who we are<br/>
</h3>
<p>Joy and I are the founders, managers, and two of the members of the Glass City Swing Band. A nostalgic 18-piece group playing swing music of the 1930's and 40's.</p>
<p> Now in our sixth year, the GCSB has grown in it's personnel and proficiency of the Swing style and is in demand at local festivals and events. The GCSB takes it's name from Jeannette, PA which was known for its many glass factories during the swing era and was known as ""Glass City PA."" </p>
<p>Managing an 18-piece swing band takes a lot of energy, teamwork, and funding. We've got the energy and the teamwork, but being on a fixed income due to our disability - we are lacking funding.</p>
<p>Joy and I have Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy. LGMD is a disease that slowly weakens the limb muscles as well as some of the vital organs such as the heart and lungs. We may not be able to walk, but that hasn't stopped us. We've both earned performance degrees in music from Seton Hill College in 1989. And we've spent all our adult life playing in musicals, teaching music lessons and participating in musical ensembles. Glass City Swing Band is our most exciting challenge to date.</p>
<p>Due to our disability employment opportunities are limited, so, obtaining funding for the band has become quite challenging. Our dream for Glass City Swing Band is to help preserve swing music but at the same time contribute our time and talent to encourage others with disabilities to pursue their dreams. So, it is our hope to get support from you, the music lover and benefactor.</p>
<p>The funding that we seek would be utilized to purchase musical scores for the band, rent sound equipment for live performances, compensate band members for their time and talent, produce a CD recording for promotional use, purchase larger instruments such as a keyboard and a baritone saxophone, and purchase marketing material.</p>
<p>We also intend to use our talents and time to play for charitable organizations in surrounding communities to help raise money for great causes like promoting the arts in schools and the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Your funding will help make this possible.</p>
<p>So, join us to help keep swing music alive - all while supporting causes that are close to our hearts. </p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your support.</p> </div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div><strong>

</ul></div>","Brief intro of who we are

Joy and I are the founders, managers, and two of the members of the Glass City Swing Band. A nostalgic 18-piece group playing swing music of the 1930's and 40's.
 Now in our sixth year, the GCSB has grown in it's personnel and proficiency of the Swing style and is in demand at local festivals and events. The GCSB takes it's name from Jeannette, PA which was known for its many glass factories during the swing era and was known as ""Glass City PA."" 
Managing an 18-piece swing band takes a lot of energy, teamwork, and funding. We've got the energy and the teamwork, but being on a fixed income due to our disability - we are lacking funding.
Joy and I have Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy. LGMD is a disease that slowly weakens the limb muscles as well as some of the vital organs such as the heart and lungs. We may not be able to walk, but that hasn't stopped us. We've both earned performance degrees in music from Seton Hill College in 1989. And we've spent all our adult life playing in musicals, teaching music lessons and participating in musical ensembles. Glass City Swing Band is our most exciting challenge to date.
Due to our disability employment opportunities are limited, so, obtaining funding for the band has become quite challenging. Our dream for Glass City Swing Band is to help preserve swing music but at the same time contribute our time and talent to encourage others with disabilities to pursue their dreams. So, it is our hope to get support from you, the music lover and benefactor.
The funding that we seek would be utilized to purchase musical scores for the band, rent sound equipment for live performances, compensate band members for their time and talent, produce a CD recording for promotional use, purchase larger instruments such as a keyboard and a baritone saxophone, and purchase marketing material.
We also intend to use our talents and time to play for charitable organizations in surrounding communities to help raise money for great causes like promoting the arts in schools and the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Your funding will help make this possible.
So, join us to help keep swing music alive - all while supporting causes that are close to our hearts. 
Thank you in advance for your support.   What We Need & What You Get
The funding that we seek, $44,000 for this campaign, would be utilized for the items listed below:

 The purchasing of musical scores for the band - $2650 (yearly). The breakdown for the musical scores would be as follows: 10 arrangements written by arrangers at $200 per arrangement would be a total of $2,000.  Ten published arrangements at $50 - $75 per arrangement.  Averaging a total of $65 per arrangement, the total would be $650 for already published arrangements.


The renting of sound equipment for live performances - $9,000 (yearly). The breakdown of the renting of sound equipment would be as follows: 18 gigs per year at $400 - $500 per gig. Taking the higher total of $500 per gig would give you a total of $9,000 per year for the renting of sound equipment. The renting of sound equipment would consist of a qualified sound technician bringing their equipment to each gig, coming and setting up all the sound equipment, mixing the band, and tearing down for each gig. 


Compensating band members for their time and talent - $10,800 (yearly). The breakdown of compensating our musicians for charitable gigs would be as follows: 6 charitable gigs per year at $100 per band member. There are 18 members in the band so the total for each gig would be $1,800 bringing the yearly total to $10,800

The production of a CD recording for promotional use - $4,000 (one time). The breakdown for a CD recording would be as follows: 100 Digipaks plus tax is a total of $260.02. 100 blank CD's and Memorex CD labels plus tax is a total of $56.18. Mechanical licensing of 16 songs 5 minutes and under for 100 CDs plus tax is a total of $357.86. 32 hours in a recording studio with mixing, plus  mastering and plus tax is a total of $2,501.60. Bringing the grand total to $3,175.66. Leaving the total at $4,000 because it is unknown if we would need more hours in the studio. 


The purchasing of a Keyboard, case, bench, cables, volume pedal and stand - $777.70 (one time). The breakdown on the cost of the piano package would be as follows: 2 15-foot cables at $24.80, Keyboard bench at $33.31, Sustain pedal at $20.51, Keyboard stand at $42.19, replacement plan at $4.99 Yamaha P105 piano keyboard at $504.19, and a keyboard case at $97.74. Taxes at $49.97 bring the piano package total to $777.70


The purchasing of a professional Baritone Saxophone, mouthpiece, bari sax stand, and gig bag - $9,474.55 (one time). The breakdown of the baritone package is as follows: Yamaha YBS-62 Professional Baritone Saxophone $8,345.99, Meyer baritone saxophone mouthpiece $200, Hercules baritone saxophone stand $38.74, Protec Contoured baritone saxophone Pro Pac case $269.99.. Taxes would be $619.83 making the total baritone saxophone package at $9,474.55.


White polo shirts with the GCSB logo for Summer gigs - $370 (one time). The pricing per polo shirt would be $19.00. Tax would be $20.52 bring the total to $362.52 for 18 polo shirts.  Averaging out to $370 for bigger sizes. 


Signage for promoting the band's image and for publicity - $250 (one time). The breakdown for the signage is as follows: 5 band fronts with the GCSB logo on the front at $30 per piece for a total of $150. A banner with sponsor names and/or logos on it at about $85. The tax would be $14.10 for a total of $249.10. Averaging that out would bring the total to $250.


Incentives and shipping the incentives for this campaign - $1650 (one time). All incentives breakdown as follows: T-Shirts (60) is a total of $992.82. This includes shipping and tax but not international shipping fees. CD (60) are $232.20. This includes shipping and packaging to ship. This does not include international shipping fees. One iPad mini is a total of $331.93. This includes tax and shipping but not international shipping fees. Bumper sticker (30) is a total of $90.50. This includes tax and shipping but not international shipping fees. The grand total would be $1,647.45. Averaging it out to $1,650.

Indiegogo and credit card fees - $4677 (one time). If all funding for this campaign is made then it will be at a lower funding but not knowing how the flexible funding for this campaign will come out, there is a 12% fee added on to the campaign fund to cover the costs of Indiegogo's fees.

<h3>Who we are...</h3>
We are the Collinsville All-Stars, a ghetto-tech industrial horrorcore hip-hop group known for offensive music and over the top live performances that are typically remembered as legendary parties. Over the last 12 years we have played a plethora of shows, met lots of great people and produced several terrible demo recordings of questionable quality. <br/><br/><h3>What it is...</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
</div><div> <p>Up until now, no one has had the opportunity to obtain a worthwhile 
recording of Collinsville All-Stars material, or see it live ever again... Now you have the power to change that.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why dat crowdfunding doe?<br/>
</h3>Creating a worthwhile recording and/or a live show on caliber with what we have presented in the past - is a costly effort. Since we would love to be able to do both, (before we're all way too fucking old) we have created this crowdfunding effort in an attempt to let anyone who wants to see it happen again, one last time, pitch in to make it a reality. It would be pointless to dive back into the effort if no one wanted to see it happen, so we are allowing fans to throw down on it ahead of time, so as to judge the appeal of a reunion and gauge the possibility of this actually occurring.<br/><p></p>
<h3>How does this ish work?</h3> Your donation allows you to choose one of the different levels of perks provided on the page to the right. We have set a realistic goal for the cost of throwing what will hopefully be the most incredibly epic Collinsville All-Stars show ever, and recording / creating an album.<br/><br/><h3>Break down where my money goes, son.<br/>
</h3>We are not going to spend time nickel and diming with pie chart economics and whatnot, as this crowdfunding will cover MOST of the cost of achieving these goals. In reality money will probably still come out of our pockets to make it happen one way or another.<br/><br/><h3>What do I get for donating?<br/>
</h3>
</div><div> <p>The lowest level actual donations (read: at least $12) get both a ticket to a future live show sometime in 2015 at a yet to be determined venue in the St. Louis area, AND a copy of the new recordings; as well as their name in the liner notes as a donator. Higher level donations can obtain all kinds of extra goodies as indicated in the perks section located to the right. All Hoodies and other merchandise will be available for pickup the day of the show.<b> </b>We will email you when the Kickstarter is finished at your Paypal Contact Email address to obtain your size from you<b>.</b></p>

<p></p>
<h3>Why should I do this?</h3>If you want to come party with us one last time, and have a chance to actually have a Collinsville All-Stars recording, you should donate to the cause. The donation is far cheaper than a night out at the local bar, or seeing that shitty national band you like that just stands there doing nothing for 30 minutes.<p></p>
<h3>I only have an affiliation with ""X"" member of your group.. Will they be included in this event/album?</h3>Yes. Rob, Brian, Kurt, Twee, Adrian and Pat will all be featured on the album/live show.<br/> <ul></ul>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<h3>What are the details on this album? </h3>The goal is to put out a digital equivalent of a ""double disc"" mixtape, one disc including including all the old material, (Songs like 618, Armadillos on Fire, etc) re-recorded and re-engineered to sound listenable; The other disc containing a plethora of new material. <b>It will only be obtainable by funding through this crowdfunding opportunity.</b> ALL Donors will receive a download key to obtain this album when it is released.<br/><p></p> <ul></ul> </div> <h3>What are the details on this live show? </h3><p>The show will take place sometime this year in 2015, after the album is finished being created and ready to be released. There is not yet a specified date or venue for this to occur. ALL Donors will receive a single ticket to the event and advanced notice when these details are confirmed so that they will be able to arrange attendance.<b> Depending on the response to this campaign, it is possible the show could sell out</b> (based on the chosen venue and amount of tickets sold through this crowdfunding campaign.)<br/></p><h3>What is the risk of me donating?</h3><h3></h3><ul>
<li>If the complete goal IS NOT met, all money is returned to donors.<br/>
</li>
<li>If the complete goal IS met, shit's gonna go down, yo.</li>

Since we would love to be able to do both, (before we're all way too fucking old) we have created this crowdfunding effort in an attempt to let anyone who wants to see it happen again, one last time, pitch in to make it a reality. It would be pointless to dive back into the effort if no one wanted to see it happen, so we are allowing fans to throw down on it ahead of time, so as to judge the appeal of a reunion and gauge the possibility of this actually occurring.
How does this ish work? Your donation allows you to choose one of the different levels of perks provided on the page to the right. We have set a realistic goal for the cost of throwing what will hopefully be the most incredibly epic Collinsville All-Stars show ever, and recording / creating an album.Break down where my money goes, son.
We are not going to spend time nickel and diming with pie chart economics and whatnot, as this crowdfunding will cover MOST of the cost of achieving these goals. In reality money will probably still come out of our pockets to make it happen one way or another.What do I get for donating?

 The lowest level actual donations (read: at least $12) get both a ticket to a future live show sometime in 2015 at a yet to be determined venue in the St. Louis area, AND a copy of the new recordings; as well as their name in the liner notes as a donator. Higher level donations can obtain all kinds of extra goodies as indicated in the perks section located to the right. All Hoodies and other merchandise will be available for pickup the day of the show. We will email you when the Kickstarter is finished at your Paypal Contact Email address to obtain your size from you.
Up and Coming Baller Perk Level Hoodie:




Why should I do this?If you want to come party with us one last time, and have a chance to actually have a Collinsville All-Stars recording, you should donate to the cause. The donation is far cheaper than a night out at the local bar, or seeing that shitty national band you like that just stands there doing nothing for 30 minutes.
I only have an affiliation with ""X"" member of your group.. Will they be included in this event/album?Yes. Rob, Brian, Kurt, Twee, Adrian and Pat will all be featured on the album/live show. 


What are the details on this album? The goal is to put out a digital equivalent of a ""double disc"" mixtape, one disc including including all the old material, (Songs like 618, Armadillos on Fire, etc) re-recorded and re-engineered to sound listenable; The other disc containing a plethora of new material. It will only be obtainable by funding through this crowdfunding opportunity. ALL Donors will receive a download key to obtain this album when it is released.   What are the details on this live show? The show will take place sometime this year in 2015, after the album is finished being created and ready to be released. There is not yet a specified date or venue for this to occur. ALL Donors will receive a single ticket to the event and advanced notice when these details are confirmed so that they will be able to arrange attendance. Depending on the response to this campaign, it is possible the show could sell out (based on the chosen venue and amount of tickets sold through this crowdfunding campaign.)What is the risk of me donating?
If the complete goal IS NOT met, all money is returned to donors.

If the complete goal IS met, shit's gonna go down, yo.
If the complete goal is exceeded, it's seriously going to be one hell of a show.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Along the way we will be taking 12 Greyhound buses, 7 Maritime buses, 1 flight, 2 ferriesand, 1 Island Link bus.

<b>Accommodations </b>- $2,160.00 </div>
<div>Along the tour we will be staying with close friends whenever possible to cut back on accommodations. As for the stops where we don’t know anyone we will be staying in hostels, to insure we spend as little on accommodations as possible. As it stands right now we have places to stay in 13 out of the 26 stops.However, if anyone can offer us coverage in any of the cities listed below, that would be a much-appreciated contribution Edmundston, Fredericton, St. John, Moncton, Charlottetown, Naniamo, Victoria, Chilliwack, Kelowna, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Regina &amp; Winnipeg.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>Food </b>– $2,660.00</div>
<div>We will be on a budget of $10/day each for food, which will amount to a total of $140.00 ($70.00 each) per week…for 19 weeks; the grand total for food expenses will be $2,660.00.</div>
<div>We will be getting 90% of our food from grocery stores to make sure we don’t exceed our food budget. As Rastafarians we also don’t eat meat, fast food or junk food.All expenses included for both persons, will come to a final grand total of - $7,620.36</div>

The Tour Impact


Reggae music has had a tremendous impact on the world. The message of the music has brought people, of all corners of the earth, together in love and harmony for generations and generations to come. 

Blues music for nearly a century has been the outlet to those who were otherwise unable to voice their hardships and bloodshed. Blues music is the songs of the oppressed…. The sound of the slaves… A perfect fit for Reggae.

Through our signature Roots Blues Reggae sound we not only cater to Reggae lovers but Blues listeners and singer-songwriter fans as well. Bringing patrons to a Reggae concert who may normally may not have attended a show of that genre otherwise. 


Risks & Challenges
  The First challenge will be making the amount of money we need to cover our transportation and accommodations costs. If we fail to meet this goal, we will be forced to either find other means of transportation (hitchhiking) as well as not staying in any hostels (tents), and/or we would have to reduce the length of the tour – which would be devastation. 

Lack of transportation funds will likely also make us late for making stops in time.

By being on the road for nearly 5 months our faith and dedication will be put to the test. Expenses aside, we will be performing and traveling relentlessly, with few breaks.

In 2011 he released his debut EP Water &amp; Fire which has been described as “spiritually uplifting” (Challenge Weekly) and “a beautiful offering … from a passionate faith” (Salvation Army; Firezone).

<p><em>After playing the LifeFM Summer Tour earlier this year and to a packed out show at Parachute Festival Strahan has been working hard writing an album, which is due to be released later in 2012.</em>""</p>
<p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>Last June I released my debut EP Water &amp; Fire as an independant artist not really knowing what would come of it. Well, the EP went global being downloaded in over 20 countries in the first number of months, hitting the airwaves in NZ and OZ and giving me opportunities to play shows and preach around the country.</p>
<p>It's been an incredible adventure with a whole bunch of new opportunities opening up for me later this year including a few shows in Australia before Christmas.</p>
<p>I've been writing new tracks this year and have 14 (none from the first EP) to hit the studio with which will be culled down to 11 or 12 for the album. I'll be recording with legendary NZ producer Nic Manders who gets the style and heart behind what I'm trying to do which is so important.</p>
<p>The songs are written and the plan is set but in order to make it happen I need your help.</p>
<p>I need to raise $20,000 to record, master and produce the album (figures on this page are in $US). </p>
<p>I'd love you to be a part of this exciting journey with me by pre-purchasing the album or purchasing one of the perks to your right. Every dollar counts and so does every person you share this with.</p>
<p>I'll be hitting the studio's as soon as I've raised the money and releasing the album before Christmas if all goes to plan.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your support to this point and into the future. </p>

<h2><strong>FAQ's</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Wheres the money going exactly?</strong></p>
<p>The money raised through this campaign will fully fund the production of my first full-length album which will go out to over 20 countries and be gigged around the world. Funding the album this way gives me the opportunity to play the music wherever God leads me, not according to the largest pay cheque.</p>
<p>I need $18,000 to do this, which will go to studio time, producing, equipment, and the actual physical album production. It covers it all from the recording process through to getting the CD's printed and the artwork designed.</p>
<p><strong>What do you get?</strong><br/>Some sweet sounds I hope! At the least you'll get pre-released music. At the most the opportunity to have me play a private concert at your house. But ultimately that sweet feeling that you helped me get more music out there!</p>
<p><strong>And if I don't reach the goal?</strong><br/>If I don't reach the goal, funds will go into a secure account and will be untouched while I find other ways to fundraise.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Gregg.  More importantly, my daughter's name is Lucy.  She is 7, and she is a talented musician.  But it doesn't really matter how talented she is - what matters is that she has a huge heart.  She has decided to make an album of original songs that she wrote herself, and sell the CD's for $10.  She wants to give 100% of all proceeds to kids who need food.  Make no mistake: every dollar we raise in this campaign will go toward feeding hungry kids.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Target Funding Goal: $5,500</p>
<p>Use of funds: to pay for the replication and fulfillment of 5,000 CD's.  This way, all $10 of sale proceeds will go to feed hungry kids.  That's what Lucy wants. </p>
<p>If we don't raise $5,500, or if we raise more than $5,500, all proceeds will go toward costs of replicating and fulfillment of the CD sales.  The more we raise, the more CD's we'll produce and sell.  The more CD's we replicate at one time, the cheaper the cost per CD is, and the more money we can use to feed hungry U.S. kids.</p>
<p>What you get: Our only perk is a copy of Lucy's CD.  For any contribution of $25 or more, you also get a copy of Lucy's CD.  She is probably not the next Alicia Keys, but she might contribute to the end of child hunger in America.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The most significant impact Lucy's project will have is that of feeding hungry kids.  Each meal costs $0.25 to package so a $10 CD sale will feed 40 kids one meal. </p>
<p>The charity is Outreach, Inc. - Kids Care.  <a href=""http://www.outreachprogram.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.outreachprogram.org/</a></p>
<p>Another, less significant but still important impact of her project is that other creative kids might be inspired by Lucy's creativity and generosity if she is successful.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, please spread the word.  We will be generating quite a bit of media coverage of Lucy's crusade to feed hungry kids.  Use Indiegogo's tools as well as your own resources and networks please!</p>

<p><strong>With your help, a new generation will get to know the chamber music of these two masters whose careers and lives were so tragically shaped by the madness of Nazi Germany</strong></p>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">
<br/>Now is the time- Gal's trios waited nearly 80 and 40 years for American performances. It's time to redress the neglect that began when Hitler banned this music in 1933. At least Gal was able to continue working after the War- Krasa was killed in Auschwitz just days after finishing the Passacaglia and Fugue, his harrowing final work which concludes this disc. Give for them, give so their voices are heard by new audiences.</div>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Complete String Trios of Hans Gál and Hans Krása</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://ensemble-epomeo.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Ensemble Epomeo</strong></a> need your help to relase a very beautiful and important CD of the complete music for string trio by Hans Gál and Hans Krása, leading members of a gifted generation of Jewish composers in Central Europe whose destinies were shaped by Nazi persecution in the years 1933-1945.</p>
<p><a href=""http://orelfoundation.org/index.php/composers/article/hans_krasa/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hans Krása (1899-1944)</a> was born in Prague and had established himself as one of the most exciting Czech composers of his generation in the years before WW II. However, in 1942, he was arrested by the Nazi's and interred in the Theresienstadt ghetto, where he helped guid the unlikely flowering of a diverse musical life in collaboration with fellow-composers Pavel Haas, Gideon Klein and Viktor Ullmann until his deporation to Auschwitz, where he was murdered in the gas chambers on October 18, 1944. His two string trios come from the last months of his life, the visceral  and intense ""Tanec"" (or ""Dance"") and the extraordinary ""Passacaglia and Fugue,"" the very last piece he wrote. Krása's music was largely forgotten in the decades after the War, and has only recently begun to be rediscovered and fully appreciated</p>
<p>Viennese composer <a href=""http://hansgal.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hans </a><a href=""http://hansgal.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gál (1890-1987)</a> was lucky to escape to Britain with his family in 1938, but endurred terrible hardships in British internment camps during the War, before settling in Edinburgh. His Serenade for Trio, opus 41, was composed in 1932, at the peak of his pre-war career when he was director of the conservatory in Mainz. His Trio in F-sharp Minor, opus 104, written in 1974, is part of the extraordinary late flowering of  Gál's creativity in his ninth decade. Together, these two remarkable works frame a long and astonishingly diverse artistic life. Although Gál survied the war, his music fell into obscurity in the mid- 20th c., and these remarkable trios have remained almost completey unknown prior to their world-premiere recording on this disc. Ensemble Epomeo, in fact, gave the the first North American performances of both pieces.</p>
<p>Four beautiful and important works, long forgotten in the wake of tragedy and dislocation are brought together on this important recording for Avie Reocrds, who have led the way in the rediscovery of Gál's music, with a series of recordings that have been among the most widely critically praised discs of the last few years. Gramophone Magazine has hailed Gál's  <em><strong>“structural genius and contrapuntal mastery""</strong> </em>and priased the serie's<em><strong> ""…committed performance…splendid sound, warmly recommended.""</strong> </em>Classic FM Magazine has said <em><strong>""Gál is truly worth rediscovering""</strong></em> saying the series has <em><strong>""left me intrigued and delighted""</strong></em></p>

</div></div>","We've met our $5000 goal for Indiegogo (BRAVO and thanks to everyone who has helped), but since our fundraising concert earlier this summer fell short of its goal, we're still short of the $7500 we need to put the disc out. 
This Indiegogo campaign is done, but you can still donate here



 
With your help, a new generation will get to know the chamber music of these two masters whose careers and lives were so tragically shaped by the madness of Nazi Germany

Now is the time- Gal's trios waited nearly 80 and 40 years for American performances. It's time to redress the neglect that began when Hitler banned this music in 1933. At least Gal was able to continue working after the War- Krasa was killed in Auschwitz just days after finishing the Passacaglia and Fugue, his harrowing final work which concludes this disc. Give for them, give so their voices are heard by new audiences.
 
The Complete String Trios of Hans Gál and Hans Krása
Ensemble Epomeo need your help to relase a very beautiful and important CD of the complete music for string trio by Hans Gál and Hans Krása, leading members of a gifted generation of Jewish composers in Central Europe whose destinies were shaped by Nazi persecution in the years 1933-1945.
Hans Krása (1899-1944) was born in Prague and had established himself as one of the most exciting Czech composers of his generation in the years before WW II. However, in 1942, he was arrested by the Nazi's and interred in the Theresienstadt ghetto, where he helped guid the unlikely flowering of a diverse musical life in collaboration with fellow-composers Pavel Haas, Gideon Klein and Viktor Ullmann until his deporation to Auschwitz, where he was murdered in the gas chambers on October 18, 1944. His two string trios come from the last months of his life, the visceral  and intense ""Tanec"" (or ""Dance"") and the extraordinary ""Passacaglia and Fugue,"" the very last piece he wrote. Krása's music was largely forgotten in the decades after the War, and has only recently begun to be rediscovered and fully appreciated
Viennese composer Hans Gál (1890-1987) was lucky to escape to Britain with his family in 1938, but endurred terrible hardships in British internment camps during the War, before settling in Edinburgh. His Serenade for Trio, opus 41, was composed in 1932, at the peak of his pre-war career when he was director of the conservatory in Mainz. His Trio in F-sharp Minor, opus 104, written in 1974, is part of the extraordinary late flowering of  Gál's creativity in his ninth decade. Together, these two remarkable works frame a long and astonishingly diverse artistic life. Although Gál survied the war, his music fell into obscurity in the mid- 20th c., and these remarkable trios have remained almost completey unknown prior to their world-premiere recording on this disc. Ensemble Epomeo, in fact, gave the the first North American performances of both pieces.
Four beautiful and important works, long forgotten in the wake of tragedy and dislocation are brought together on this important recording for Avie Reocrds, who have led the way in the rediscovery of Gál's music, with a series of recordings that have been among the most widely critically praised discs of the last few years. Gramophone Magazine has hailed Gál's  “structural genius and contrapuntal mastery"" and priased the serie's ""…committed performance…splendid sound, warmly recommended."" Classic FM Magazine has said ""Gál is truly worth rediscovering"" saying the series has ""left me intrigued and delighted""
This CD will be the debut disc from the Anglo-American string trio  Ensemble Epomeo, who gave the Gál trios their American premieres in 2010 and 2011 respectively.  The recording was made leading producer/engineer (and grandson of Hans Gál), Simon Fox and in the beautiful concert hall at the Millfield School in Somerset, England in December 2011.


Ensemble Epomeo, Caroline Chin-violin, David Yang-viola and Kenneth Woods-cello, is an internationally touring string trio, whose performances combine intensity, virtuosity and accessibility.
Founded in 2008, their inaugural tours saw them performing in Italy, the UK and the USA, with performances at the Newburyport and Ischia festivals, and broadcasts on New England Public Radio and WKCR Columbia University in New York, where they were the subject of a 3 hour special showcase concert.
 
For more information about Ensemble Epomeo and the music on our debut CD, please visit http://ensemble-epomeo.net/
 
Ensemble Epomeo's debut CD is a sponsored project of Musica Reginae, a 501(c)(3) non-profit Arts organization. Contributions for Ensemble Epomeo must be made payable to Musica Reginae Productions and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Donations made on Indiegogo will go directly to Musica Reginae.
 


What We Need & What You Get
This important disc is ""in the can,' but we can't release it without your help!
 We need you to help us raise at least $5000, a portion of the approximately $8,000 outstanding budget which includes production and post-production costs, mastering and pressing costs and mechanical copyright fees.

<p>UK bands <strong>Inertia</strong> &amp; <strong>Attrition</strong> are 2 of the most hardworking bands in the UK's Dark Alternative music scene.  Attrition have been together for 30 years!  And Inertia for 19 years!!</p>
<p>Both bands have several releases under their belts from over the years and have played countless tours and shows individually.. including several US Tours.</p>
<p>Inertia have just released their brand new album <strong>""Deworlded""</strong> and Attrition have recently released a best of compilation <strong>""Dreamtime Collectors 1980-2010"".</strong>  Both bands are highly regarded in the music scenes of which they exist.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>US Tour April 2011</h3>
<p>The bands have been asked to appear on the forthcoming <strong>""Darkfest""</strong> East Coast USA Tour together with US bands <strong>Ego Likeness</strong> and <strong>The Ludovico Technique</strong>.  Inertia &amp; Attrition have not toured the USA for a few years, so this tour poses a perfect opportunity for both bands to go on the road together and play to their US fanbases who have been requesting that they play the US again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The current tour schedule is:-</p>
<p> </p>
<p> -April 6th Atlanta, GA @ Masquerade<br/>-April 7th Savannah, GA @ ClubOne<br/>-April 8th New Orleans, LA @ HiHo Lounge<br/>-April 9th Tulsa, OK @ Eclipse<br/>-April 10th Nashville, TN @ The Rutledge<br/>-April 11th St. Louis, MO @ Crack Fox<br/>-April 13th Raleigh, NC @ Legends<br/>-April 14th Baltimore, MD @ Orpheus<br/>-April 15th Pittsburgh, PA @ 31st St Pub<br/>-April 16th New York City (TBA)<br/>-April 17th Rochester, NY @ Water Street Music Hall </p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This will be a well attended tour with all bands playing to a good audience and a chance to play to each other's fanbases.</p>
<p>If all goes well, we will all be back to do it on the West Coast of the USA later in the year!<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Our Indiegogo Goal</h3>
<p>As much of a great tour this will be and excellent opportunity for the bands.  Fees within the smaller section of the alternative music scenes are not so high.  But costs for doing a tour with 4 bands are quite high!</p>
<p>The fees and merchandise sales that are made will go directly to Van hire, Gas, accommodation and food.  However, both UK bands have the expense of flights from the UK to the USA.  This will not be covered as part of the tour expenses and will cost in the region of $3000,</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We need your help in raising $3000 within 3 weeks!</strong>  On offer are lots of very cool packages, which we are sure will make your pledge worthwhile!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tours of this nature hardly ever make a profit, but the satisfaction of playing to your audiences Worldwide makes touring like this very special.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the event of us not making our goal, whatever is made will go towards cost of flights.  <strong>ANYTHING</strong> will help, but the full $3000 will, help the bands go on the road debt free and make the tour even more enjoyable.</p>

MÃ‰XICO
17 pieces by composers from six countries â€¦ tons more info at  www.cantodelamonarca.com/info_eng.html
14 muses â€¦ including Sor
Juana InÃ©s de la Cruz, las Adelitas, MarÃ­a Sabina, Frida Kahlo & her Casa Azul (Blue House) â€¦ more info
at www.cantodelamonarca.com/info_eng.html
1 pianist â€¦ thatâ€™s me, Ana
Cervantes, la Quijote â€¦ see my blog www.anacervantespiano.blogspot.com or the Monarca website, www.cantodelamonarca.com â€¦ follow me on Twitter: @laquijotegto)
This is drop-dead
gorgeous music.  No words.  So, you have the
freedom to associate your own words
and images with it.  You could call
it â€œclassicalâ€ â€¦ but it wasnâ€™t written 200 years ago, it is TOTALLY NEW.  
It was inspired
by women who soared beyond the
limitations of the societies they were born into.   Some of them lived centuries ago â€¦ but they still challenge us to open our
own wings and take flight.   Eight of the
composers are WOMEN.
Now I
am ready to record nine --Â¡maybe ten!â€” of these
splendid pieces.  That will cost $15,000.   Iâ€™d like to record in March-April
2011, but I'll be here for as long as it takes to raise those
funds.
I commissioned this music and itâ€™s been written.  Iâ€™ve shared it with audiences in
both MÃ©xico and the US.  The response is galvanizing.  
What pieces
will I be recording?
Â·       Silvia Berg (Brazil); Alba Potes (Colombia); Pilar Jurado, Carlos Cruz de Castro,
TomÃ¡s Marco (Spain); Horacio Uribe,
Marcela RodrÃ­guez (MÃ©xico); Jack
Fortner, Charles Griffin (USA) â€¦
read more at www.cantodelamonarca.com/info_eng.html 
Lots of video!  just search for Ana
Cervantes on VIMEO & Youtube.   
â€¢    As
the daughter of a Mexican father and a Nebraska mother, I grew up deeply aware of the need
for communication across cultures, and of the courage and
persistence it
takes to walk through those barriers. 
Everyone is asking for your money, so Iâ€™m going to do
something heretical and just say:  
PARTICIPATE!
Â·      
VISIT THE WEBSITE!  â€¦ and leave
a thought about what Monarca
means to you;
Â·      
If you live in the flight-path of
the Monarch Butterfly, take a photo and send it to us at fans@cantodelamonarca.com.  If itâ€™s not truly horrible (how could it
be?!), weâ€™ll publish it on the site.
Â·      
Lots more cool
interactive stuff on the Monarca website â€¦ watch this space for
announcements!
Â·      
Tweet me at laquijotegto so Iâ€™ll feel like you care ;=))
If your participation takes the form of donating money to Monarca,
WONDERFUL!

Ã‰sta es
mÃºsica hermosa Â¡como para morirse!  No tiene letra â€“ tienes la libertad de asociar tus propias palabras o imÃ¡genes.  Supongo que lo podrÃ­as llamar â€œclÃ¡sicaâ€ â€¦ sÃ³lo que no fue escrita hace 200 aÃ±os, es COMPLETAMENTE NUEVA.  
Es inspirada en mujeres que volaron mÃ¡s alla
de lo permitido en las sociedades en que nacieron.  Aunque
algunas vivieran hace siglos, todavÃ­a nos retan a abrir nuestras propias alas y
despegar.  Ocho de los compositores son MUJERES.
Ahora estoy lista para grabar nueve --Â¡quizÃ¡ diez!â€”de estas esplÃ©ndidas piezas.  CostarÃ¡ US$15,000.  Me gustarÃ­a grabar en marzo-abril del 2012 â€¦ pero aquÃ­ estarÃ© hasta recaudar estos fondos.   
Yo
encarguÃ© esta mÃºsica y estÃ¡ escrita.  Lo he compartido con pÃºblicos en MÃ©xico y en EU y la respuesta es asombrosa.  Mucho video, sÃ³lo buscas Ana Cervantes en Youtube y en Vimeo.

I'm enjoying honoring the moments I share with them and constantly trying to become a better person by sharing those moments through my music. That's why I've decided to write the second album now and call it ""The Dawn Of Momentum"", partly because I promised Mum that her name would be in the title (Ha) but mostly because this really is the Dawn Of Momentum for me. It's a concept album, the concept is The Universe, life, stars, Heaven, Death, Fate etc...<br/><br/>I've gained so much awareness of my own self-expression over the past year and at points it's been a very bumpy ride, ever since Dad passed away. A short time ago I had some incredibly heart opening experiences that helped me drop my low self confidence and assisted the opening of my heart, in turn, delivering these amazing new songs which I now need to share with you.<br/><br/>I feel that the best way of doing that is by honoring the people that have supported my music career over the years. My fans, my family, friends and supporters... I really would like you all to be a major part of this new album.<br/><br/>We've just started the creative process for branding, the new sound

and life experiences since my award winning debut release ""Slowly Diabolical"" in 2008.<br/><br/>This year, ""Warning Signs"" my collaborative single, written with Darnell Swallow (UK) has obtained me the nomination for Best Dance Artist at this years Los Angeles Music Awards. This will be my 6th nomination and if we win, my 4th award. It's a great introduction to the new sound and a perfect wave to ride as we've also submitted ""Warning Signs"" to The Recording Academy for the 2011 Grammy's for Best Dance Recording and Best Short Form Video. The sound of the new album isn't going to be this dance heavy but it's a good introduction. It's going to be somewhere in the middle of my normal style of indie rock/pop fused with Electro.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen:  it's true - a new album is forthcoming!  And here is your chance to help us finish it. </p>
<p>It might come as a bit of a surprise to some of you to hear that we've embarked on this rather imposing task of recording a new album, and honestly, it all came as a bit of a surprise for us too.  As many of you know, this last year has been quite a tumultuous year for us, and in some ways we never anticipated ourselves being in the position we now find ourselves: ready to tackle the studio with new music in hand. </p>
<p>It's been a year full of dramatic transitions, where we saw the addition of a great creative dynamism in new band members, Ben-David and Andrew.  It's also been a tough year, where the tragedy and mystery of death hit close to home, with the passing of Alexander and Daniel's mother and grandmother, as well as good friend Patrick Halloran of the band Ceann.  After 1200 shows in 8 years, we decided to take some time off to let everything sink in for what it was.</p>
<p>But in January, after a couple of months to ourselves, we met up for 10 days in a house in upstate NY, and songs just started to flow.  It was unexpected, but it was clear that things were rising to the surface, and all we could do was try to keep up.  After this rock tumbler of a year, we came out of that ""band camp"" energized and eager to share a new side of Scythian.  It really drove home to us the healing power of music. </p>
<p>You'll still hear the same upbeat energy in songs like ""End of the Street"" and ""Leaving of Liverpool"", but then you'll also hear songs that are more pensive and reflective, like ""Far Away"" and ""Whiskey"". You'll hear a ripping rendition of the Ukrainian-Carpathian song, Arkan from the region where the Fedoryka boys' ancestors are from. And thanks to Ben-David's enthusiasm, we've reconnected with our acoustic roots with some great new Irish trad sets as well.  In many ways, we feel the songs on the upcoming album really capture Scythian in it's latest, and we feel, most dynamic stage, which is part of the reason we felt compelled to share it with you all.  Not only compelled, but truly excited for you all to hear what's been brewing.</p>
<p>It’s a changing music industry.  In many ways this is a good thing. The record labels have less creative control over artists, the gate-keepers of FM radio no longer dictate what you get to hear as a music lover, and it's by and large less expensive to hear new music.</p>
<p>But, with that said, more and more costs fall upon bands to produce and release new music. Making an album right is an expensive process, from recording, mixing, mastering and promoting, and when there is no record label to pay for it, it falls on us to raise the money through touring, which is a big part of why we’ve been on the road constantly for the last eight years.  Ironically, you need to be off the road for the creative space to make music, but off the road you can't save money for the album you'd like to make.  And it is a big reason why there were 5 years between our last two studio albums.  But this great platform has changed that.  Your valuable dollars and support will go to pay for studio time, engineering, mixing, mastering, and printing.</p>
<p>So this is where you all come in: through IndieGoGo we are able to provide a variety of ways for you, our loyal fans, to actively participate in the process of making a studio album.  In return, we're offering perks and packages – from advanced copies of the new record, all the way up to a private house concert in your own back yard – as a way for us to generate enough money to record, mix, and release this new album in 2012.  This will be an album for you, and in a fundamental way, by you. </p>
<p>As an extra thank you from us, anyone who buys a digital download of the album and up will receive three free songs, ready for immediate download: a song from the new album, Steve Earl's ""Galway Girl"", the Beatles' ""I Should Have Known Better"", and ""Sands of Time (Sara's Song)"", which Joey wrote for Sara on their 1 year anniversary. These tracks aren't available anywhere else, but we want you to have them as an extra thank you for your support. Once you become a backer, you will receive an email with a link and a download code to claim your free downloads.</p>
<p>The amazing outpouring of support that we've consistently gotten from you all has utterly humbled us throughout the years, and we humbly ask for your help in making this album a reality.  There are always costs around every corner.  Major record labels spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on publicists, radio promoters, and tour support for each album they release.  Our goal of $17,000 will cover the bare bones of studio time, mixing, mastering, session fees and printing of the album.  Any extra capital raised beyond our campaign goal would go towards valuable publicity and distribution: helping Scythian release the music from this album to radio stations in our 6 strongest markets.</p>
<p>If you’ve read this far, then chances are you’ve met us after one of our shows, and know what kind of guys we are and why we’ve poured our hearts into this band for the last 8 years.  We're hoping you can help us produce our best album yet.  We believe in generosity, and so in turn we'd like to let you all know that we will be sharing 10% of everything we've raised, no matter how much or little, with the poor and the hungry.  We were blown away that a family could be fed for a month in northern PA from the several hundred dollars you all donated during our tour with Enter the Haggis.  Your generosity is the only reason we're here, and all we can do is pass it on. </p>
<p>We ask for your help and support to make this a reality for us in 2012.  We are looking for a June release, but we'll be sharing it earlier with those of you who can help us out in this campaign.  Stay tuned here and to our Facebook page for pictures, videos and updates from the studio.  We salute you and sincerely thank you for helping us make the best album we can. </p>
<p>UPDATE: WOW!! The response has been incredible - we are blown away!! THANK YOU EVERYONE!  Just a note: We will be sending you an email with the download codes, but there will be a slight lag time, maybe up to as many as a few hours.  Sorry!  This is our first time working with this platform and we're working it out as we go - thanks for your patience!</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>
<p>I learned to sing Disney songs when I was young, and I hope that one day I can combine with what I have learned from music training with popular Disney tunes to create my very own versions of these songs. So here it is, a familiar theme with versatile voice, talking instruments, storytelling with popular Disney tunes. This will also be very educational for young musicians to be with it's unique style of music that shows what a music instrument can produce besides it's traditional sounds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This album is very special to me because it will be created by the public, yes, that's all of your that have, will or may contribute to my campaign.</p>
<h3>And to show my appreciation, for anyone contributing $50 or more, your name will be listed in the final release of the CD album.</h3>
<p>I hope this can be a successful campaign so I can share this experience with people that loves music from around the world to enjoy!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you and have a Magical day!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">An Interview with the Mad Hatter:</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>Hatter:</strong> Hello everyone!</p>
<p><strong>Alice/Cheshire Cat/March Hare:</strong> Hello Hatter, welcome to our interview today.</p>
<p><strong>Hatter:</strong> Ohhh… It’s my pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>Cheshire Cat:</strong> So… I heard you want to record an album… what type of album…? Well…? Tell us…</p>
<p><strong>Hatter:</strong> Yes, this will be a Tribute to Disney album with the album named “Mad as a Hatter”. The album will be fun and easygoing. Like a musical, it will have a storytelling approach. Music arrangements will be influenced by Malay and Chinese instruments. In two of the songs, I will sing in four different languages including English, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Malay. There may be up to three languages in the same song. Yeah, it’s kinda like an ethnically album. Musicians will use their skills with their instruments to communicate and speak to me. Listeners will be able to use their imagination to picture the scene. Just like how Walt Disney would do it, with great story telling and good imagination.</p>
<p>This album will also be very educational for young musicians to be. They will be able to witness and understand how a musical instrument can “speak” in a conversation.</p>
<p><strong>March Hare:</strong> Hehehehehe… Can you make some tea?</p>
<p><strong>Cheshire Cat:</strong> can you stick... to the subject... please?</p>
<p><strong>March Hare:</strong> Hehehehehe… oh yeah, the subject… hehehehe… So how will you portray this Mad Hatter?</p>
<p><strong>Hatter:</strong> I guess you can say that I will be, musically “mad”. Just like the other instruments in the album, I will play around with my voice, as they will with sound.</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> So Hatter, I don’t understand… Why Disney?</p>
<p><strong>Hatter:</strong> Disney is my dream. I always thought that Walt Disney was a great storyteller, and I learned a lot of important life lessons through watching Disney animations. They are meaningful, and also promotes encouragement. I have been a Disney fan since I was a young child. I wanted to become a cartoonist, while I was also fascinated by Disney musicals, so I started to draw Disney characters, and also pretended to portray the princesses by singing and acting. Well, singing and acting was of more interest to me in the later years, and this eventually led me to fall in love with musical theater. So I said to myself, if I were to record an album, I would do so to tribute Walt Disney and to share my experience with all Disney fans around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> Oh! That sounds wonderful! I too love to dream.  Oh pardon me, I also heard from March Hare that besides singing, you can also draw very well?</p>
<p><strong>March Hare:</strong> Hehehehehe… Oh Yeah.. hehehe… she can tea... i mean she can draw!</p>
<p><strong>Cheshire Cat:</strong> Draw? What can YOU draw?</p>
<p><strong>Hatter:</strong> Yes yes yes, I love to draw.  I draw all kinds of Disney characters especially the princesses and I have been practicing for a very long time. I can also draw the three of you, as you will see on the album cover.</p>
<p><strong>Cheshire Cat:</strong> So what else do you need to do to prepare for this album?</p>
<p><strong>Hatter:</strong> Support. Yes, we need support from everyone to finish this album. Since we are a bunch of independent musicians and not working for any studios or labels, we really need all the help we can get. The above video is the demo introduction song for the album; we will fine-tune it once we start working on it. Thank you and enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>Alice/Cheshire Cat/March Hare:</strong> Thank you everyone!</p>

Disney fans young &amp; old will love this show."" - Pam Spedus, Walt Disney Family Museum</em></p>
<p><em>""Ms. Chew has a wonderful voice and sang quite a variety of Disney hits from some of Disney's great films. It was a fun evening.

<h2>The Goal:</h2>
<p>To reach our goal of $25,000, we will need all the support we can get. The money we receive will go into the production of the album which will includes;</p>
<ul>
<li>Musicians</li>
<li>Production team members</li>
<li>Studio rentals in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and Kuala Lumpur - Malaysia.</li>

</ul>
<p>We want to create an album with the best qualities possible, but we can not do it without your support.

<p> </p>
<h2>What you get:</h2>
<p>Of course you will get digital downloads and CDs. And being an artist herself our vocalist, Paulway, also creates beautiful drawings of Disney characters with an alluring style, hence the name for the series, The Allure Series. These drawings will be available as post cards, calendar, booklet, and phone cases.

<div> </div></div>","Update:
I learned to sing Disney songs when I was young, and I hope that one day I can combine with what I have learned from music training with popular Disney tunes to create my very own versions of these songs. So here it is, a familiar theme with versatile voice, talking instruments, storytelling with popular Disney tunes. This will also be very educational for young musicians to be with it's unique style of music that shows what a music instrument can produce besides it's traditional sounds.
 
This album is very special to me because it will be created by the public, yes, that's all of your that have, will or may contribute to my campaign.
And to show my appreciation, for anyone contributing $50 or more, your name will be listed in the final release of the CD album.
I hope this can be a successful campaign so I can share this experience with people that loves music from around the world to enjoy!
 
Thank you and have a Magical day!
Sincerely,
Paulway
 
An Interview with the Mad Hatter:
Hatter: Hello everyone!
Alice/Cheshire Cat/March Hare: Hello Hatter, welcome to our interview today.
Hatter: Ohhh… It’s my pleasure.
Cheshire Cat: So… I heard you want to record an album… what type of album…? Well…? Tell us…
Hatter: Yes, this will be a Tribute to Disney album with the album named “Mad as a Hatter”. The album will be fun and easygoing. Like a musical, it will have a storytelling approach. Music arrangements will be influenced by Malay and Chinese instruments. In two of the songs, I will sing in four different languages including English, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Malay. There may be up to three languages in the same song. Yeah, it’s kinda like an ethnically album. Musicians will use their skills with their instruments to communicate and speak to me. Listeners will be able to use their imagination to picture the scene. Just like how Walt Disney would do it, with great story telling and good imagination.
This album will also be very educational for young musicians to be. They will be able to witness and understand how a musical instrument can “speak” in a conversation.
March Hare: Hehehehehe… Can you make some tea?
Cheshire Cat: can you stick... to the subject... please?
March Hare: Hehehehehe… oh yeah, the subject… hehehehe… So how will you portray this Mad Hatter?
Hatter: I guess you can say that I will be, musically “mad”. Just like the other instruments in the album, I will play around with my voice, as they will with sound.
Alice: So Hatter, I don’t understand… Why Disney?
Hatter: Disney is my dream. I always thought that Walt Disney was a great storyteller, and I learned a lot of important life lessons through watching Disney animations. They are meaningful, and also promotes encouragement. I have been a Disney fan since I was a young child. I wanted to become a cartoonist, while I was also fascinated by Disney musicals, so I started to draw Disney characters, and also pretended to portray the princesses by singing and acting. Well, singing and acting was of more interest to me in the later years, and this eventually led me to fall in love with musical theater. So I said to myself, if I were to record an album, I would do so to tribute Walt Disney and to share my experience with all Disney fans around the world.
Alice: Oh! That sounds wonderful! I too love to dream.  Oh pardon me, I also heard from March Hare that besides singing, you can also draw very well?
March Hare: Hehehehehe… Oh Yeah.. hehehe… she can tea... i mean she can draw!
Cheshire Cat: Draw? What can YOU draw?
Hatter: Yes yes yes, I love to draw.  I draw all kinds of Disney characters especially the princesses and I have been practicing for a very long time. I can also draw the three of you, as you will see on the album cover.
Cheshire Cat: So what else do you need to do to prepare for this album?
Hatter: Support. Yes, we need support from everyone to finish this album. Since we are a bunch of independent musicians and not working for any studios or labels, we really need all the help we can get. The above video is the demo introduction song for the album; we will fine-tune it once we start working on it. Thank you and enjoy!
Alice/Cheshire Cat/March Hare: Thank you everyone!

One minute she sings in a soft-spoken undertone, the next you will be completely blown away by a voice that resonates an alluring intensity. Paulway's passion for music and art came at an early age of 6 where she was influenced with Disney animations from her parents. She began building her passion and skills throughout her childhood.

She sings Disney classic songs and sounds just like a true Disney princess; you can sing along to every song. Disney fans young & old will love this show."" - Pam Spedus, Walt Disney Family Museum
""Ms. Chew has a wonderful voice and sang quite a variety of Disney hits from some of Disney's great films. It was a fun evening. I thoroughly enjoyed the show and believe that ""children"" of all ages from 5 to 105 who have a love of Disney would really enjoy it."" - Derek Willhite, Golden Gate Disneyana Club
With the show having great receptions, Paulway was invited to perfrom the same show at the Walt Disney Family Museum on February of 2012.

The Goal:
To reach our goal of $25,000, we will need all the support we can get. The money we receive will go into the production of the album which will includes;

Musicians
Production team members
Studio rentals in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and Kuala Lumpur - Malaysia.
Mixing and Mastering by Abbey Road Studios.
Transportation cost
Production of CDs
Printed materials

We want to create an album with the best qualities possible, but we can not do it without your support. We are aiming at a release date of hopefully late 2013 or early 2014, but with our musicians scattered in different locations, it may take a little longer to complete our album. April of 2014 is listed in our perks, but we are aiming to complete this album and get it to everyone before that date.
 
What you get:
Of course you will get digital downloads and CDs. And being an artist herself our vocalist, Paulway, also creates beautiful drawings of Disney characters with an alluring style, hence the name for the series, The Allure Series. These drawings will be available as post cards, calendar, booklet, and phone cases. You may view enlarged versions of these drawings at http://amadeuxway.deviantart.com.
You will be able to choose one your favorites.

<p></p></div>","SHORT SUMMARY Hello there my name is James Kenney. I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon.  I started singing and writing songs at age 11 and haven't stopped since.  My dream has always been to share my voice with as many people as possible.  And through my second time on X Factor this season, I was able to do that.I've been so grateful for all the support I've received.  People keep saying to me, ""Don't give up."" Well, your words have been a major inspiration.  People have also been asking for music, and this is my chance to fulfill your requests.  I'll be recording an EP trilogy to cover all my bases:  one entitled ""Covers,"" comprised of songs I sang on The X Factor along with other cover faves of my own; a second called ""Songs In 3/4,"" inspired by classic soul; and a third EP called ""I Am James Kenney"" that will be all new songs I will be writing just for this project. One of my favorite quotes is ""Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans,"" by John Lennon.  Because it's costly to make music, and I have a family to support, I haven't had the means to record a lot of my own music.  That's why your contributions are so crucial for me to complete this project and let my voice be heard. FUNDING THE DREAMI need to raise at least $15,000 to get this project off the ground.  And, believe it or not, that's being conservative.  These EPs will be recorded in some of the best studios in LA and feature some of the most well-respected and accomplished musicians in the world.  My goal is to make all three of these EPs sound just as good as any record made by a major label.  The difference is their budget is hundreds of thousands of dollars.  But with the level of talent I have on my side, we will make these songs sound pristine and give you something quite special and beautiful to listen to. Please look to the right and see the list of incentives I've come up with for your pledge.  Pretty fun stuff all the way from just getting a single song for a buck to hanging for lunch to having me give you a private concert in your own living room.If I don't reach my goal (which I pray doesn't happen), I will still record as much of the project as financially possible.  Even if it's just one or two EPs, I WILL get you some music to listen to.  That is the promise I make to you.OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELPSome people just can’t contribute, and I totally get it.  But I can still use your help:

<h3>The Story:</h3>
<p>So, a few weeks ago we were presented with one of the most amazing opportunities of our career. We were offered three shows on the West Coast for the last ever VANS WARPED TOUR! Needless to say we were freaking out! This is an opportunity that literally only comes once in a lifetime!</p>
<p>We knew we had to accept the offer, and in typical Blameshift fashion we would somehow figure out the logistics (how we would get there from the East Coast, what gear we would play, where we would stay and how we would get around). Then to add to the craziness, we came up with the idea of recording a new song while we are out in California. As most of you know our producer, Erik Ron (Godsmack, New Years Day) is based out of North Hollywood and it's not often that we make our way to California. Plus, it's been way too long since we've gotten in the studio! So, we made the decision to attempt the impossible! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Have Officially Lost Our Minds:</h3>
<p>To pull this all off in less than a month is a HUGE undertaking both financially and mentally ;) But, we've pulled off crazy things like this before...all with your help! Over the years you have been our backbone! People ask us all the time how we have accomplished so much as an independent band and it all comes back to you guys.You have supported us and helped us every step of the way.</p>
<p>Your support will help us get to California to play the final Vans Warped Tour on the Shiragirl Stage and will get us back into the studio to record a brand new single! The coolest part about this new song is this will be the first time our rhythm section (Mike LaRoche &amp; Jeff Maurer) record &amp; write new music with Blameshift. This is something we've been excited about for a few years! </p>
<p> </p>
<div> </div>
</div><div>
<h3>How Your Support Will Help Us:</h3>
<p>We promise to give all of our amazing donators behind the scenes access, perks and so much more. Any donation at all helps us pull this off! Your donation will specifically help us pay for: </p>
<div><ul>
<li>4 Round Trip Tickets to California</li>
<li>A Vehicle Rental to Get from Show to Show (We aren't able to take our bus)</li>
<li>A Place to Stay for About 10 days (Could be the vehicle we rent lol)</li>
<li>Studio Time with Erik Ron to Record a Brand New Blameshift Song</li>
<li>A Million Other Little Expenses</li>
</ul></div>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<p>We know that this is an extremely short campaign. We were put on a huge time constraint and we are trying to achieve the impossible in about 3 weeks! So, if you aren't able to donate at this time, you can still help us get the word out there! We are up for the challenge of making this tour and new music a reality and we know that you guys are the only way we can make it happen! </p>
<p>Thanks so much for all your love and support! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Hayley Ryerson, and I am a fiddler &amp; composer residing in Nova Scotia, Canada. I'm raising funds to record a collection of Celtic music called, 'Both Sides of The Water.'  The release is April 7, 2020. This campaign has several perks you can choose from, ranging from 5$ to 1000$ (on a mobile, swipe right to view all perks; on a tablet or computer, view right side bar o view perks. Click on each perk to learn more about it!). Thank you for your time in viewing my campaign video, FAQs, and perks! Your support is creating positive work for my colleagues and I, making a beautiful collection of tunes become a reality, and supporting a young composer and artist.</p>
<p>This record will be a meaningful collection of 13 tracks, including many beloved traditional tunes, 5 original tunes, 3 tunes by fellow contemporary Celtic composers, and 1 original poem. This album will be a valuable record in my development as a player, composer, interpreter, and artist. It will feature musicians with whom I have been playing and performing over the past 3 years,  as well as many invited musicians to add a rich variety of instrumental textures to the arrangements on the album.  </p>
<p>Creating 'Both Sides of The Water' is important to me; the album presented itself to me in its entirety one year ago, asking to be made. I have met challenges in attempting to fund the album process myself, which is why I am reaching out for support with this campaign. So I can be able to record &amp; release this collection of music that so wants to see the light of day, to reach your ears, heart, storyline, and toe-tappin' feet. </p>
<p>Receiving your support will be an absolute delight, and it will be so fulfilling to send you a copy of this album! </p>

<p>This project has several perks you can choose from, ranging from 5$ to 1000$. You can also make a custom contribution if you'd prefer to contribute a different amount, or would like to donate without a perk in return.</p>
<p>All of the funds raised in this campaign will cover the costs associated with the 4 phases of this album's creation.  The project goal of 12,000$ is informed by Hayley's industry experience and is designed to provide a frugal yet professional quality album process &amp; product.  </p>
<p>The process and budget design for 'Both Sides of The Water' looks like this:</p>
</div><div>
<p>1. <strong>Production.</strong> This is when the musicians perform in studio to create the tracks for the album. Costs associated with this phase include artist fees, engineer fees &amp; studio rental. </p>
<p>The budget fro this phase is 44.5% of the project goal. This provides the project with 3 days in our chosen studio with 4 bed track musicians on those days, 6 short overdub sessions, and an engineer and assistant for all sessions. </p>
<p>2. <strong>Post-Production.</strong> This is when a skilled audio engineer takes the raw recorded tracks we've produced and works with them until they are happy to be in your CD player, or another digital home. In this phase tracks are edited, mixed, and mastered. There is so much creativity  and skill in this step... engineers are the hidden start behind every tasty piece of recorded music and we look forward to giving our engineer a comfortable working pace and time to get artful with the mix!</p>
<p>Costs associated with this phase are engineer fees and studio rental. The budget for this phase in 20.9% of the project goal. </p>
<p>3. <strong>Design. </strong>This is when a visual artist develops a visual representation for the album. I have chosen a beautiful artist to work with, whose muse is sea creatures. I cannot wait to collaborate with her to develop a stunning cover art commission. Also in this phase is album design. A designer will incorporate the cover art into the other panels of the album and format the album notes, with all the juicy tidbits of tune names and inspirations, and names of musicians on the track.</p>
<p>Costs associated with this phase are commission fees, and hiring a designer for the album design. The budget for this phase is 10.5% of the project goal. </p>
<p>4. <strong>Manufacturing &amp; Distribution. </strong>This is when we get to print the album so we can share, ship, and share some more! It is also when the album will make its way to its digital home, CDBaby. </p>
<p>Costs associated with this phase are manufacturing fees, and online platform fees. The budget for this phase is 22.1% of the budget. </p>
<p>5) Indiegogo's service fees @ 2% of project budget.</p>
<p>The above budget will support the artistic vision for this album and provide an enjoyable, efficient, resourced process- the means being able to feature a rich variety  of instrumental textures on the album, having a comfortable studio schedule during the recording process to allow premium performances to come through the musicians, and including time enough during mixing to let it be a creative element and felt-presence on the final album's aesthetic. </p>
<p>If the campaign goal is not fulfilled, 'Both Sides of the Water' will still be created with the support we do receive. We will make adjustments to the process and resulting album (eg: less instrumental textures, less studio time, more functional mix), and will be happy to realize it how we can.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help </h3>
<p>Please share the campaign widely within your network- friends, family, musical peers, lovers of traditional, Celtic, folk and roots music, or anyone else you think may be interested in the project.</p>
<p>I truly appreciate your support and involvement in this project. THANK YOU!!</p>

If the campaign goal is not fulfilled, 'Both Sides of the Water' will still be created with the support we do receive. We will make adjustments to the process and resulting album (eg: less instrumental textures, less studio time, more functional mix), and will be happy to realize it how we can.

Other Ways You Can Help 
Please share the campaign widely within your network- friends, family, musical peers, lovers of traditional, Celtic, folk and roots music, or anyone else you think may be interested in the project.
I truly appreciate your support and involvement in this project. THANK YOU!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Project Description and Background</h3>
<p>After 22 years of studying North Indian Hindustani music I am ready to make a series of Dhrupad vocal audio recordings. These will be pressed into CDs and released online through all streaming platforms. (CDs are still a popular form of audio storage for the Hindustani music community, and allows for more detailed program notes and information about the music.) </p>
<p>The primary drummer for these recordings is <a href=""http://dhrupad.org/gundecha-brothers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pandit Akhilesh Gundecha</a>, a living master of the pakhawaj drum, and one of my Gurus. I am deeply honored that he is lending his talents to this project.</p>
<p>These recordings will be in honor of my Gurus, with deep respect for their endless support and encouragement, and in memory of Pandit Ramakant Gundecha, who unfortunately passed from this world to the next last year.</p>
<p>My journey into Hindustani music started when I was very young. A full explanation can be found here: <a href=""https://paytonmacdonald.com/dhrupad-biography/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://paytonmacdonald.com/dhrupad-biography/</a></p>
<p>I first studied tabla, and then in 2011 I switched to Dhrupad vocal and I've been a disciple of the Dhrupad masters the <a href=""http://dhrupad.org/gundecha-brothers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gundecha Brothers</a>. I spent nine months in India as a Fulbright Scholar, plus many other trips to India, plus I've been learning here when my Gurus are in North America, plus Skype lessons. I made my professional debut as a Dhrupad singer in 2014 and am now finally ready to record. I have toured all over the U.S., Canada, Europe, and India, performing on major festivals. I've also made five YouTube <a href=""https://youtu.be/tW_B-n34jxI?t=248"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">videos</a> of my Dhrupad singing.</p>
<p>I will record the following ragas, in full exposition of all four movements, with alap, jor, jhala, and bandish:</p>
<ul>
<li>Todi</li>
<li>Ahir Bhairav</li>
<li>Lalit</li>
<li>Bhimpalasi</li>
<li>Madhmaad Sarang</li>
<li>Jog</li>
<li>Malkauns</li>
<li>Bihag</li>
</ul>
<p>The final result will be six full-length recordings.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I seek support so I can record, mix, and master the audio files, as well as press hard copies of the CDs. I also have personnel costs with the audio engineers, graphic designers, and honorariums for the drummers. Here are the levels you can contribute:</p>
<ul>
<li>$10-$50, Friend, name listed on website page for recordings</li>
<li>$51-$150, Two signed CDs sent to you, and name listed on website</li>
<li>$151-$300, Three signed CDs sent to you, and name listed on website</li>
<li>$301-$500, Six signed CDs sent to you, name listed on website, and a meal with Payton at his house in New Jersey and he'll show you the process for the recordings, including the DAW files, and other information.</li>
<li>$501-$1000, Six signed CDs sent to you, name listed on website, and private house concert for you (for concerts outside of the NYC area some travel expenses may be necessary)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Budget:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recording/mixing/mastering costs = $1,000</li>
<li>Artist Fees for pakhawaj drummers = $1,000</li>
<li>Graphic Designer (through Fiverr) = $200</li>
<li>Microphone (Rhode NT 1-A) for home recording portion = $270</li>
<li>CD Duplication = $1,500</li>
<li>Miscellaneous = $30</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total cost: $4,000</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>These recordings will further the ancient art of Dhrupad. Dhrupad is an oral tradition, guru-shishya-parampara. The music isn't written down, but rather passed down from guru to disciple, one at a time, generation after generation. Recordings are an essential part of this oral tradition. I am very lucky that I have learned these ragas sitting at the feet of the master Gundecha Brothers, who learned them from their gurus (Z.F. and Z.M. Dagar), and so forth, back 19 generations in the Dagar bani.</p>
<p>These recordings will add another perspective to this tradition. They will serve as a marker of my development so far, as well as another guidepost for future generations of Dhrupad students. My Gurus have given me permission and encouragement to make these recordings. Dhrupad is one of the crown jewels of Indian culture, and preserving it through audio recordings is essential. Although I'm not Indian, Gurujis have never given that a second thought. Above all this music is <i>human</i>, and the fact that people from all over the world are now singing it at a high level only strengthens and deepens the art form and the tradition.</p>
<p>I've spent tens of thousands of hours in deep riaz (practice), learning the nuances of this music, and am ready to share it with the world through professional audio recordings.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Probability of Finishing the Project</h3>
<p>I've made over 20 recordings so far in my career as a percussionist and singer and I know exactly what the costs and time commitment are. I am 100% confident that I will complete this project, and in fact I've already recorded one of the ragas and it turned out very well, and Akhilesh Guruji has already made his drumming track, so the project is well underway. I just need your support to finish it.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't offer financial support that's okay, but you could help by asking people to get the word out about this campaign. I would sincerely appreciate any publicity you can generate about this project. The Indian-American community and the Yoga communities are especially interested in this music.</p>

<p><strong>Show Dad: </strong>Want your own *~private~* Born Dad show?

<h3>Shipping Deets</h3>
<p>The default option for all physical merch item perks will be picking up in-person from the Dads. We know so many of our fans and friends are based in DC, and we don't want you to have to pay for shipping if you live just down the street, y'know? Also, did you know, shipping is expensive when you're a small operation like ours!</p>
<p><strong>But that means if you are not in the DC area or do not want to pick up your physical items in person from the Dads, please make sure to select the Shipping add-on perk when you're checking out, otherwise, we won't be able to get you your stuff! </strong>(Or, more likely, we'll have to coordinate with you after the fact and it'd probably be a lot of emails and Venmo coordination and honestly that just sounds like a lot of work for both of us!)</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, but want to help out, that's awesome! You can share our campaign on whatever social media you like using, and make sure to tag us @born_dad (on instagram) or @BornDadDC (on twitter)! Stream our songs on Spotify or bandcamp! Tell your friends irl! Anything helps and we are eternally grateful for it.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Worry not! There is no risk of the album not coming out. However, this campaign will make it feasible to recoup some of our costs.</p>
<p>Born Dad is a pretty DIY operation. We book our own shows, we make most of our own merch, and as we said above, we have funded the making of this album so far out of the money we have made playing shows over the past couple years and a lot from our own pockets. We don't have support from a label, and we want to keep Born Dad going as long as we can without breaking the bank. This campaign will help make that possible!</p>
<p>We love and appreciate all the support we have gotten over the past few years, and we want to keep making more Born Dad content for you! Thank you.</p>

You can go get drinks/dinner or go see that movie no one else will go to with you! Maybe we'll wanna splurge and go to one of the museums you actually have to pay to get in to! The options are limitless! (Except for location, which is limited to the DC area only. Although, if you wanna pay to have us travel somewhere else....get in touch).
*CLAIMED* Sports Dad: This past summer, a friend of drummer Zach's sent him this hat and an unsigned note via Etsy as a birthday present and he lost his mind for 3 days trying to figure out where it came from! (He figured it out eventually). Now this completely unique, one-of-a-kind baseball cap can be yours!

Show Dad: Want your own *~private~* Born Dad show? We'll play your back yard, your living room, your abandoned, yet structurally sound barns, or anywhere in the greater DC area that has electricity! We're offering two of these shows, and we encourage folks to go in on these together because we love friendship and we love playing shows.
Shipping Deets
The default option for all physical merch item perks will be picking up in-person from the Dads. We know so many of our fans and friends are based in DC, and we don't want you to have to pay for shipping if you live just down the street, y'know? Also, did you know, shipping is expensive when you're a small operation like ours!
But that means if you are not in the DC area or do not want to pick up your physical items in person from the Dads, please make sure to select the Shipping add-on perk when you're checking out, otherwise, we won't be able to get you your stuff! (Or, more likely, we'll have to coordinate with you after the fact and it'd probably be a lot of emails and Venmo coordination and honestly that just sounds like a lot of work for both of us!)

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, but want to help out, that's awesome! You can share our campaign on whatever social media you like using, and make sure to tag us @born_dad (on instagram) or @BornDadDC (on twitter)! Stream our songs on Spotify or bandcamp! Tell your friends irl! Anything helps and we are eternally grateful for it.
Risks & Challenges
Worry not! There is no risk of the album not coming out. However, this campaign will make it feasible to recoup some of our costs.
Born Dad is a pretty DIY operation. We book our own shows, we make most of our own merch, and as we said above, we have funded the making of this album so far out of the money we have made playing shows over the past couple years and a lot from our own pockets. We don't have support from a label, and we want to keep Born Dad going as long as we can without breaking the bank. This campaign will help make that possible!
We love and appreciate all the support we have gotten over the past few years, and we want to keep making more Born Dad content for you! Thank you.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Damien Boggs and I'm a singer-songwriter living in Columbia, Tennessee. I was raised in southeastern Louisiana surrounded by music from an early age. I began writing and performing in Baton Rouge in my early 20's. I moved to the Nashville area and started to really learn what it meant to be a ""musician"". This project is very important to me and acts as a measuring stick for me as an artist. Your support will allow us to release these songs and begin the process of touring and promoting this record. We have poured countless hours of our souls into this record and are really excited to share it with you. With your support, this will be just the beginning of a very productive and musical period. When we reach our goal, we will be able to continually provide new music and content at the high level that you, the listener, deserves.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking to raise $5000. These funds will pay for the production, mastering, and release of this project. Making a quality album is not only a challenge for an independent artist, it can be nearly impossible without the support of an amazing fan base. I am blessed to have an awesome support team and I am so excited to work with you in this campaign. I have come up with some great perks in gratitude of your support. You can claim perks that range from a Tshirt to a full band house concert and lots of cool things in between. When we reach our goal, the turnaround of the release will be quick and exciting. In the event we miss our goal, I will try to release the songs as singles throughout the year, but we are gonna make this goal and release a great record. This record is your record, not mine or the band's. We are only able to do this because of you and we are GRATEFUL!</p>

<h3>Campaign Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Brian Rice and I am a full time percussionist with a specialty in Brazilian percussion, in particular the Brazilian tambourine called ""pandeiro"". Over the last 22 years I have been performing choro music with many masters of the genre and have recorded with many choro groups. My dedication to this music led to the creation of the Berkeley Festival of Choro of which I am Artistic Director.</p>
<p>This project is very special to me because it is my first full recording project with my long-time friend and collaborator, Almir Cortes. Originally from Bahia, Almir is a master of the mandolin and guitar and is currently Professor of Music at the University of Rio de Janeiro’s Villa-Lobos Institute. I am also very pleased to have the expert hands of Nando Duarte on the 7-string guitar. Nando is from Rio de Janeiro and currently lives in Los Angeles where he is a composer and producer of music for commercials. He studied with the choro guitar master Dino 7 Cordas.</p>
<p>This CD will be a testament to the special musical connection between the three of us. Our goal is to capture the playfulness of our performance, and also to present less common choro songs to our audience. We plan to invite a few special guests to play on select songs which will add to the CD’s variety.</p>
<p>We aim to raise $4,500 from this campaign. Though this amount will not cover every cost of the project, it will offset the great expenses of studio recording, which can cost $500 per day or more. Following the initial recording, the music needs to be mixed in a studio, mastered for reproduction, artwork created and the CD reproduced. Some of these funds may go to offsetting the cost of flying in Almir from Rio, and Nando from LA, to Oakland where we will record.  </p>
<p>As a contributor, you can be confident that you will have helped us achieve a milestone in our trio's career. This CD will help us develop the music we play, the synergy we share, and shore up our future with a product that represents us and spreads this beautiful music to others.</p>
<p>For your donation of $30 or more you will receive a copy of the CD. We also offer other perks including multiple signed CDs, free entry to one of our concerts, or even a private concert for you and your guests, depending on your level of support.</p>
<p>Choro music has the ability to draw in aficionados of both jazz and classical music because of its crossover appeal and beauty, adding to the wonderful diversity of musical ideas and creativity so needed in our world today. I truly believe that music and art is at the heart of a vibrant, thoughtful and caring society.  </p>
<p>I hope that you will contribute today and help us reach our goal. Watch for our CD this summer! </p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<div>Two years ago, a group of 18 Toronto musicians came together to record and produce an album which captured the spirit of an improvised jazz jam session. In a single day of recording, and through self-funding, Collective Order made their first record, Volume 1. The following year, the concept expanded, and CO emphasized the creation and documentation of original music composed by members of the group. <strong>Volume 2 was released to critical acclaim in the fall of 2017.</strong>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p><i>""<strong>Collective Order Vol. 2</strong> is a unique project that <strong>showcases some truly original songs</strong>, excellent musicianship and the voice of Jocelyn Barth alone makes this a must-have for any jazz fan.""</i></p>

<p> </p>
<p><i>""[Volume Two] In which we find ourselves in the midst of the first, all original, mental telepathy jazz date--and we find the bar is set pretty high... Taking solid, non-showy-for-the-sake-of-showy improv to places it’s never been, there’s something here for everyone but oddly enough, it’s solid enough that everyone will probably like everything.

Our Plan
On May 27 and 28 of 2018, we will be going into the studio to record Collective Order: Volume 3. Our vision for the new record is to create a songbook of 12 original pieces that are tied to each composer/member's personal and cultural story. 
This is where YOU come in!

This is Jeff from St. Elmo’s Fire. As a teenager, I started this band with a good friend of mine and vocalist lyricist, Tim Allwein. It was a long time ago in a garage far, far away (actually in Sacramento, CA). What did we do? We formed this band, we wrote, we rehearsed, we played crappy clubs, we opened for major artists, we played more crappy clubs, we moved to Hollywood in the ‘80s, we partied and mingled, we wrote more, we put out a successful single titled ""Really in Love"", we signed record contracts with CBS, BMG and more, we toured, we made videos, we toured some more, we released four albums, and well, you get the picture!<div><br/></div><div style=""text-align: center;"">

</div></div>","FROM US TO YOU!Hi, fellow rockers. This is Jeff from St. Elmo’s Fire. As a teenager, I started this band with a good friend of mine and vocalist lyricist, Tim Allwein. It was a long time ago in a garage far, far away (actually in Sacramento, CA). What did we do? We formed this band, we wrote, we rehearsed, we played crappy clubs, we opened for major artists, we played more crappy clubs, we moved to Hollywood in the ‘80s, we partied and mingled, we wrote more, we put out a successful single titled ""Really in Love"", we signed record contracts with CBS, BMG and more, we toured, we made videos, we toured some more, we released four albums, and well, you get the picture!

St. Elmo's Fire Facebook Campaign Page





FROM YOU TO US!
 So what is this all about?  We need your help with our new record. We want this to be a joint venture between the band and our fans who want to be part of something exciting. Something that will outlive us all! Just imagine a brand new St. Elmo’s Fire album. A melodic, ass kicking, big gang chorus, solo shredding, drum pounding, fist pumping, in your face, heavy metal tour de force! Exactly the way we used to do it. The songs are written. the demos are recorded and the record label is just waiting to release it.





                SO WHY NOW? 

Why? Because we feel it is the right time. Most of our fans know that last year, one of heavy metal’s biggest labels, Germany's Pure Steel Records honored us by re-releasing our four previous studio albums as numbered collectable limited editions.                                                                                                                         

They included holograms for authenticity, bonus tracks and 12-page CD booklets. Not only that, but they wanted a new album, which  brings us to our current project. You are probably wondering why we need funding if we have already signed with a record label. The answer is simple. As professional musicians, it is important that we maintain control of the finished musical product. The label takes care of the artwork, graphics, manufacturing, distribution and promotion. What you will be doing is helping us fund the most important part of the project, the MUSIC


     Read the Pure Steel Records newsfeed about our campaign


By having you help fund the project, instead of leaving the important creative decisions up to the record label, we get to do what we do without limitations. Call it artistic freedom, if you will, but there is actually much more to it than that. We want our fans involved this time around from the very beginning. You will have exclusive access to us while we are in the studio. We want to hear your opinions and you are welcome to ask questions and offer your feedback. In a very real way, you will be making this record with us!
Our Campaign is Getting Worldwide Press. Click the Links Below 


Nemesis Magazine (Germany)




Bel7 (Europe)


SO HOW MUCH WILL WE NEED?




Since we live in Northern California, we will record here in order to keep quality high and costs low. Consequently YOU WILL NOT help fund travelling expenses, hotels or anythinfg else other than recording, mixing and editing, plus shipping the perks. And since I will be producing again, like I did with our other albums, we can control even more. But most importantly, the music will sound killer.




At the conclusion of the campaign funding, we will start the preproduction phase and then transition to the studio sessions. You will receive constant updaftes on our timeline, expenditures and progress. Also you will be able to see the whole process as it’s happening. 

And when the album is finished, we will be release it worldwide, just like our previous albums! Pure Steel Records is distributed by “Soulfood”, one of the world’s largest media distributors. The album you help make will be everywhere, including in record stores, on the internet, downloaded on websites like Amazon and iTunes or streamed on Pandora, Spotify, Rhapsody and other music sites. This album will be reviewed and talked about in the rock music press all over the world.  This is the big time and you get to be a part of it.
THE COOL STUFF!



In appreciation for your help and belief in our music, we want to go the extra mile. We are offering signed equipment we actually used to record, original framed handwritten lyric sheets, album credits, Skype guitar lessons, personalized pictures, video thank yous, free downloads, autographed albums, shirts, remixes, demos and even alternate versions not on the album. The list goes on and on.

<p>Music Video Press Release</p>
<p>“Macabre, literate and shamelessly theatrical, there's real vision behind the Widow’s Bane’s, death-folk howl. Not to mention courage — a rare commodity lately in the local scene.”</p>
<p>— Jason Heller Westword Magazine</p>
<p>“Don’t Be Afraid, It’s Only Death” will be The Widow’s Bane’s second full-length album released to date. It will be their first album recorded in a studio, as the previous recording took place in a garage. Despite it’s humble beginnings, the debut, self-titled album acquired critical acclaim in Colorado. Adam Perry of Denver’s Westword Magazine wrote, “The debut album from Boulder zombie folk-punkers, the Widow's Bane, is arresting and addictive. Mortimer Leech's love for harrowing old-time chanteys shines through (darkly) on this thirteen-song trip through death, un-death, debauchery and abuse.” Now, the seed that was planted by that first album has been germinating for three years. Meanwhile, the Widow’s Bane has continued to write, tour and record. Their new album is currently being mastered, and is slated for release in June 2013.</p>

If you love ‘em, let ‘em know it. If you hate ‘em, help them to success, and they’ll go back to their own countries and leave you all well enough alone. Good day, and God bless.</p>

Music Video Press Release
“Macabre, literate and shamelessly theatrical, there's real vision behind the Widow’s Bane’s, death-folk howl. Not to mention courage — a rare commodity lately in the local scene.”
— Jason Heller Westword Magazine
“Don’t Be Afraid, It’s Only Death” will be The Widow’s Bane’s second full-length album released to date. It will be their first album recorded in a studio, as the previous recording took place in a garage. Despite it’s humble beginnings, the debut, self-titled album acquired critical acclaim in Colorado. Adam Perry of Denver’s Westword Magazine wrote, “The debut album from Boulder zombie folk-punkers, the Widow's Bane, is arresting and addictive. Mortimer Leech's love for harrowing old-time chanteys shines through (darkly) on this thirteen-song trip through death, un-death, debauchery and abuse.” Now, the seed that was planted by that first album has been germinating for three years. Meanwhile, the Widow’s Bane has continued to write, tour and record. Their new album is currently being mastered, and is slated for release in June 2013.
On March 24th, production will begin on a music video for the title track, “Don’t Be Afraid, It’s Only Death” in order to accompany and promote the new album. While the song itself is obviously controversial in some regards, its only intended purpose, besides entertainment, is to simply invite a dialogue on death; a topic which Governor Mortimer Leech believes to be lurking in the minds of most everyone, yet is seldom spoke of.

You can buy a digital copy, a CD copy, or a vinyl copy.

<h3>Hi,</h3>
<p>My name is Tamar Love, and playing the cello has been a passion of mine for over twenty years. The one thing I have wanted most as a musician, other than sharing and speaking to people through music, is to travel abroad. I recently auditioned to participate in the Rome Music Festival and won the assistant principal cello seat. I am really proud of this accomplishment plus the many years of training and obstacles I've overcome to get to this point. I can't begin to tell you how excited I am to have this opportunity, but I can't possibly get there without your help. I need your financial support to make this happen. Here's why:</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am asking for a total of $4000. This will help with air fare for both myself and my cello. I have to buy a plane ticket for George (my cello) so it doesn't get damaged during flight, hotel stay for about a month, touring the city, and food, etc. I recieved a scholarship of $2000 to help with costs, and a work study scholarship of the same amount which they will award at the end of the program. The overall base cost is $5,500. This does not include the extra cargo fare, food and travel within the city. </p>
<p>Here are some of the perks you will recieve for donating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone who donates $25 or more will be invited to a private concert in the fall (date tbd).</li>
<li>Those who donate $75 or more will recieve an autographed copy of original cello works that I will produce within the year. </li>
<li>If you donate $350 - $500, I will treat you to a one hour private performance at the venue of your choosing (i.e. a social gathering, an intimate dinner with your special someone, a home gathering, an art opening, etc.). *In order to take advantage of this, I have to be given two weeks advance notice. This offer will expire at the new calendar year. Major holidays are excluded.</li>
<li>For a donation of $500 - $1000, you will receive an autographed copy of an original cello work which I will dedicate to you.</li>
<li>Contributors of $1000 or more will receive an autographed copy of an original cello work dedicated to you, and a two hour private perfomace at the venue of your choosing (* see the above stipulations).</li>
</ul>
<p>If I am not able to reach my goal, Rome Music Festival holds scholarships through the next year. I could delay the trip. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Again, I can't begin to put into words how important it is for me to have this experience, and how equally important it is for me to know that you believe in me enough to help me realize this dream. I know this will be a life changing experience. Thank you for your generosity.</p>

<p>Hello!  My name is Obed Floan and I am a tenor of the dramatic variety.  I have traversed a rather long and very hard path to discover that I may be the missing link to a voice type that has recently been very misunderstood by many since the days Richard Wagner was alive and composing music for it! Unlike smaller voices than mine, what I do takes a long time to develop and cultivate correctly, and there is much confusion and lack of true knowledge and mentorship in the world to help grow my voice type, rather than damage it (which is what can happen if not trained correctly).  This is why many give up before reaching the stage I have vocally, and other voice types try to sing this repertoire unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>I have struggled a lot over the years working with various world-renowned singers and teachers to discover and uncover what I was built to do vocally.  I am now at the precipice of putting myself directly in front of the people in my industry that will hopefully be able to recognize this, as well and help me fully realize globally, what I have been designed to do since birth in regard to my singing career.</p>
<p>The only problem is; I may not be able to afford to take the last steps I need to get myself in front of these casting directors, agents and artistic directors that need to hear what I have to offer the world of music.  One of those last steps that I have not taken yet, due to my lack of funds throughout the years, is a trip to Germany that anyone with my voice type must do at some point in their careers, if they truly are committed and willing to follow their path to a performing career, as I am. An explanation of what this trip is all about for those who are not familiar with the process is stated below.  But please help me make this trip a reality!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The REAL Reality of this Trip</strong></p>
<p><em>For those not familiar with this Germany Audition Tour Circuit and what it means:</em></p>
<p>In order for me to take this audition tour to Germany, I would have to locate a central residency in Germany to live from the months of October through December, without employment. The reason for this is that I would have to be available on a moment's notice to jump on a plane, train, bus or taxi to various and possibly remote locations throughout the country to sing for an audition at a house or for an agent or artistic director in hopes to obtain a singing contract or two.  Therefore, because of the time-frame and flexibility demands needed for this trip, I would potentially have to let go of my teaching position I currently have in the states and would not be drawing an income at that time. In addition to that, any contracts I may potentially pick up from this trip would typically not start until the following fall (2014).  This means that I would have to come back to the US during the holidays for the spring and summer months before these contracts begin and seek employment (very undoubtedly not successfully in this economy) while I prepare the various roles in the contracts for my return to Germany the next year.</p>
<p>You may now be putting together the idea of the kinds of funds that this trip is going to require of me, and the need to have this money in place well before travelling to Germany. If I don’t have enough money to support this trip in it’s entirety, I will not be able to go!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>As I explained above, I am in need of a great deal of funds for this audition trip.  I have set this Indiegogo.com campaign for <strong>$35,000.00</strong> in order to secure the correct amount before making travel arrangements.  If I can make <strong>at least over 85%</strong> of this goal, I know that I will have enough funding to make the trip a reality and possibly return to the states without employment and re-assimilate into society back here in the spring.  These funds would cover everything from plane tickets to daily per diem for food, rent or hotel stays where needed when traveling.  Due to the nature of this trip, all projections are just that, projections based on my research for how much will be needed for these expenses. I have created a break down of my projections that can be available upon request.</p>
<p>I have created a number of perks for you to find ways to get something more out of helping me fund this trip than just the satisfaction of knowing you helped bridge the gap existing in the world of German Opera.  As you can see to the right, here is what you can receive at the various levels of contribution (just click on the perk to the right and you are on your way):</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>For a contribution of <strong>$10.00</strong>, you will be emailed an exclusive pre-recorded thank you message from me directly! <em>(That is if you provide me your email address.)</em>

</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>For a contribution of <strong>$50.00</strong>, you will receive a very special gift from a friend of mine who makes a remarkable product we all use: Soap!  I will send you two bars of her artisanal soap from her company, “Dirt Knees Soap Co.” (<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.dirtykneessoap.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.dirtykneessoap.com</a></span></strong>).  I can't get enough of her products...they simply are the best on the market that I have tried!  You will love them!  You will be automatically subscribed to Dirty Knees Soap, but will have the ability to unsubscribe at anytime.</li>

<p>An exclusive private one-on-one 60 minute Skype voice lesson with me if you <em><strong>LIVE OUTSIDE</strong></em> of the OKC area.<em> (Lessons meeting time will be agreed upon after campaign ends; Skype credentials must be provided.)</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
</li>
<li>For a contribution of <strong>$250.00</strong>, you will be sent a postcard and an authentic gift item directly from a musically historic region of Germany while I am traveling on my audition tour in the fall.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>For a contribution of <strong>$500.00</strong>, you will be sent postcards directly from Germany chronicling my opera auditions at each place I audition as they happen.  With any success on my trip, this could be a permanent record for you of how I got my career started.  Who knows….it COULD be very valuable some day. :-)</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For a contribution of <strong>$1,000.00</strong>, you will be sent an MP3 of a VERY Special Edition of a one-of-a-time live performance debut song from a cycle written expressly for me as the inspiration by a gifted composer, Stephen Variames.  This piece was debuted on April 27<sup>th</sup>, 2012 at Oklahoma City University and, so far, this is the only public performance and/or recording of the song.  You can be the first to have your very own copy of the song before the cycle goes public.</p>
</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>For a contribution of <strong>$5,000.00</strong>, I will personally come to your home <em>(in the domestic 48 united states)</em> and perform a private mini-concert in your living room of my programming.  A tuned piano must be provided by you in the room of your choice you wish to hold the mini-concert. Date and time will be mutually agreed upon by all parties involved: you, me and my pianist based on our availabilities.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>For a contribution of <strong>$10,000.00</strong>, you will receive <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ALL THE PERKS LISTED ABOVE,</span></em> <em>(including the concert in your living room)</em>, <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">BUT</span></em> also <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ADD MY WIFE</span></em></strong>, Megan Wagner.  We have been coined <strong><em>""The Lohengrin Dream-Team""</em></strong> by members of the Ohio Wagner Society.  Again, a tuned piano must be provided by you in the room of your choice you wish to hold the concert. Date and time will be mutually agreed upon by all parties involved based on our availabilities.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>I hope you can find one of these contribution levels to your liking and will be motivated to commit to one of them!  As you can see, there are perks at every level that everyone can afford, starting from $10 on up!  But don’t feel you have to only select a perk to contribute...you can also make a customized contribution for a value you set manually starting for as little as $1.  You are completely in charge!!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I understand that in these troubling economic times, it may seem impossible to justify contributing to fundraising charities like mine, and that is when I hope you can feel inspired to get involved in other ways that can help me obtain my goal for this audition trip.  Please help me get the word out! All you need to do is <strong>just share this campaign with at least 10</strong> other people throughout your social networks, coworkers, church groups, friends and family you may have that would be interested in philanthropically supporting my trip if they are in a position to do so…or even if they aren’t (because, they might know someone or someone who knows someone…etc. You get the idea...). P<span>lease help spread the word!</span></p>
<p>Indiegogo.com makes spreading the word simple for you with a number of social networking tools you can use…please use them!  I REALLY would appreciate it!</p>

For a contribution of $75.00, you will be sent a $25 gift card of your choice from these wonderful options: Apple, Google Play (Android), Amazon, Target, Walmart.  Please specify which one you would like.  Now that’s just plain fun!
 

For a contribution of $100.00, you will be given:
An exclusive private one-on-one 60 minute voice lesson with me if you LIVE IN the Oklahoma City Metro Area. (Lesson time and place will be mutually agreed upon after campaign ends; contact information must be provided.)
OR
An exclusive private one-on-one 60 minute Skype voice lesson with me if you LIVE OUTSIDE of the OKC area. (Lessons meeting time will be agreed upon after campaign ends; Skype credentials must be provided.)
 

For a contribution of $250.00, you will be sent a postcard and an authentic gift item directly from a musically historic region of Germany while I am traveling on my audition tour in the fall.
 

For a contribution of $500.00, you will be sent postcards directly from Germany chronicling my opera auditions at each place I audition as they happen.  With any success on my trip, this could be a permanent record for you of how I got my career started.  Who knows….it COULD be very valuable some day. :-)
 


For a contribution of $1,000.00, you will be sent an MP3 of a VERY Special Edition of a one-of-a-time live performance debut song from a cycle written expressly for me as the inspiration by a gifted composer, Stephen Variames.  This piece was debuted on April 27th, 2012 at Oklahoma City University and, so far, this is the only public performance and/or recording of the song.  You can be the first to have your very own copy of the song before the cycle goes public.

 

For a contribution of $5,000.00, I will personally come to your home (in the domestic 48 united states) and perform a private mini-concert in your living room of my programming.  A tuned piano must be provided by you in the room of your choice you wish to hold the mini-concert. Date and time will be mutually agreed upon by all parties involved: you, me and my pianist based on our availabilities.
 

For a contribution of $10,000.00, you will receive ALL THE PERKS LISTED ABOVE, (including the concert in your living room), BUT also ADD MY WIFE, Megan Wagner.  We have been coined ""The Lohengrin Dream-Team"" by members of the Ohio Wagner Society.  Again, a tuned piano must be provided by you in the room of your choice you wish to hold the concert. Date and time will be mutually agreed upon by all parties involved based on our availabilities.
 
I hope you can find one of these contribution levels to your liking and will be motivated to commit to one of them!  As you can see, there are perks at every level that everyone can afford, starting from $10 on up!  But don’t feel you have to only select a perk to contribute...you can also make a customized contribution for a value you set manually starting for as little as $1.  You are completely in charge!!
 
Other Ways You Can Help
I understand that in these troubling economic times, it may seem impossible to justify contributing to fundraising charities like mine, and that is when I hope you can feel inspired to get involved in other ways that can help me obtain my goal for this audition trip.  Please help me get the word out! All you need to do is just share this campaign with at least 10 other people throughout your social networks, coworkers, church groups, friends and family you may have that would be interested in philanthropically supporting my trip if they are in a position to do so…or even if they aren’t (because, they might know someone or someone who knows someone…etc. You get the idea...). Please help spread the word!
Indiegogo.com makes spreading the word simple for you with a number of social networking tools you can use…please use them!  I REALLY would appreciate it!
 
Very Sincerely and VERY Appreciatively,

POLARITY is born of friendship and the freedom of making my own choices.  </b><br/>
</div><div>
<b><div><b><br/></b></div>Short summary</b><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>Hello, I’m Andrea Bučko from Slovakia. I compose my own music,
write lyrics, play the piano and sing. I created my first big
project two years ago with a very talented harpist Maria Kmetkova. We have
already launched my first CD „In the Middle of...“ The unusual combination of
piano music, singing and the harp was critically acclaimed in Slovakia.
However, my music is not considered mainstream here. In our country it´s
difficult to promote alternative music projects, especially when you are an
independent artist. Therefore, my CD is known mostly among artists.</span></p>
<p><b>At the moment I´m finishing my second CD which
I named POLARITY </b>(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHu34t5kANOtL9VZTu7n0bw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">here</a><b> </b>you can listen to my music) It has two
sides – a soft, emotional, acoustic side, and the second one, more rhythmic,
with electronic sounds, very modern. </p>
<p>My music is really personal. I sing about
people’s deepest doubts and emotions. I’m trying to find answers in the matters
of love, friendship and the world in general, mixing genres of jazz, slovak
folk, rock and pop. </p>
<p>Since this second CD is mostly sung in English I would like for the foreign
public to hear it as well. I decided to contact Indiegogo to catch your
attention. I want to keep the freedom in my choices, but this means that I need
financial support to keep my individuality. This is my dream and the only way
to achieve this dream is with your support.<br/>
I would like to be able to give you the gift of music as I believe that my
music will inspire you and your investment will be worth it. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b><span>Below </span></b><b>you can find samples and videos from my upcoming CD, I
hope you enjoy it.</b> It's
the best way to find out who I am and what I do.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What I need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>What I need the finance for is (physical) pressing of the album and costs
related to the CD manufacture. It´s 2000 euros. In return, I am offering my art that can be seen on the right (the perks). You can receive a new signed album ""Polarity"", an old signed album ""In the middle of..."", limited addition dedicated postcard with an invitation to the Polarity album release ceremony, live performance via Skype or in your country etc.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I've set up a goal of 2500 USD which is a
minimal amount of money needed to make my album. If <span>I manage to exceed this
amount, the money would be invested in other activities connected to album production - i
would pay the photographers, graphics, the preparation of the concert tour etc...</span></p>
<p>I thank you all very much for paying
attention and your time to my campaign and for your <span>decision to help.
Thanks to all of you I'll be able to create my music and bring happiness to all
the people
who like it...</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>...and in The End:</p>
<p><b>Here you can see some examples of my work</b></p>

</div></div>","My upcoming album
POLARITY is born of friendship and the freedom of making my own choices.  

Short summary



Hello, I’m Andrea Bučko from Slovakia. I compose my own music,
write lyrics, play the piano and sing. I created my first big
project two years ago with a very talented harpist Maria Kmetkova. We have
already launched my first CD „In the Middle of...“ The unusual combination of
piano music, singing and the harp was critically acclaimed in Slovakia.
However, my music is not considered mainstream here. In our country it´s
difficult to promote alternative music projects, especially when you are an
independent artist. Therefore, my CD is known mostly among artists.
At the moment I´m finishing my second CD which
I named POLARITY (here you can listen to my music) It has two
sides – a soft, emotional, acoustic side, and the second one, more rhythmic,
with electronic sounds, very modern. 
My music is really personal. I sing about
people’s deepest doubts and emotions. I’m trying to find answers in the matters
of love, friendship and the world in general, mixing genres of jazz, slovak
folk, rock and pop. 
Since this second CD is mostly sung in English I would like for the foreign
public to hear it as well. I decided to contact Indiegogo to catch your
attention. I want to keep the freedom in my choices, but this means that I need
financial support to keep my individuality. This is my dream and the only way
to achieve this dream is with your support.
I would like to be able to give you the gift of music as I believe that my
music will inspire you and your investment will be worth it. 
Below you can find samples and videos from my upcoming CD, I
hope you enjoy it. It's
the best way to find out who I am and what I do.



What I need & What You Get
What I need the finance for is (physical) pressing of the album and costs
related to the CD manufacture. It´s 2000 euros. In return, I am offering my art that can be seen on the right (the perks). You can receive a new signed album ""Polarity"", an old signed album ""In the middle of..."", limited addition dedicated postcard with an invitation to the Polarity album release ceremony, live performance via Skype or in your country etc.


I've set up a goal of 2500 USD which is a
minimal amount of money needed to make my album. If I manage to exceed this
amount, the money would be invested in other activities connected to album production - i
would pay the photographers, graphics, the preparation of the concert tour etc...
I thank you all very much for paying
attention and your time to my campaign and for your decision to help.
Thanks to all of you I'll be able to create my music and bring happiness to all
the people
who like it...

...and in The End:
Here you can see some examples of my work
This is my first official video - I collaborated with many artists (things I wear are originals, pictures of naked bodies were arranged by very talented photographer Evelyn Bencicova) - BE MY LOVER

The other side of my work - soft, emotional song that was created as a birthday present for my friend - HAPPY BIRTHDAY

This song is one of my favorites - SAY SORRY

This is my first slovak single from ""Polarity"" - PÚPAVA (DANDELION)

Live performance on Adela Banášová´s TV talkshow in Slovak National Theatre

</p><p>“One’s Personal Legend is what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is. At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend….whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it’s because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It’s your mission on earth” -The Alchemist</p>
<p>Fate is only understood in hindsight. Even after time passes and we see the story unfold we can just barely understand it.. like trying to put together the vestige of a dream as you wake up. </p>
<p>This is our dream. </p>
<p>It starts with Travis Baker and a change of scenery. After growing up in the Los Angeles, Travis and his family relocated to the little town called Temecula, California. Music was everything to Travis; it was his entertainment, his role models, his expression and his escape. You can't conceptualize these needs as a preteen, it’s purely visceral but he needed friends to help him express himself.  At the same time Beau Trembly was also experiencing a change of scenery. After spending 6 years outside of Cairo, Egypt, Beau found himself in the quiet suburbs of Temecula as well. Beau ran into Travis at youth group and the two bonded over music. Travis then created the first incarnation of what would become “On Being Human” in the form of a punk band called Gusto while Beau started his own band. </p>
<p>Greg Johnson picked up his first guitar after seeing his sisters’ boyfriend at the time play. He became obsessed with playing loud and fast in the styles of his idols like Metallica and Megadeth. After arriving at a new high school in Ontario, California, he sought out friends with similar interests and guitar was what connected them. Everyone knew that Greg was obsessed with guitar, but there was another Greg, one year older who was also obsessed with guitar. Greg Johnson and Greg Lesondak didn’t quite bond at first as their relationship was much more competitive in nature. Greg Johnson’s band lost to Greg Lesondak’s band at the freshman talent show and Greg Johnson vowed to come back the next year and win. Greg Johnson started his new metal band called Torrent but the showdown between Greg Lesondak’s Nothing to Lose and Torrent would never come to pass. </p>
<p>Back in Temecula, Travis was looking to shake up Gusto’s musical stylings. A member switch up and a genre change later, Gusto became Ocean Daybreak and the search was on for more members. It was then that Travis looked back to his first Temeculan friend and asked him to join. He agreed and the newly reformed band wrote the “At the End of the World” EP which grew in popularity thanks to a song called “The Prophecy”. That song was the first time Greg Johnson had ever heard of the band. Upon arriving at college, a roommate showed “Ocean Daybreak” to Greg and told him that the singer of that band lived in the same dorm. Travis Baker wasn’t the singer then, but through mutual friends, Greg and Travis finally met. Around that time though Ocean Daybreak decided they wanted a change again, of tone and of name. “On Being Human” is a poem written by C.S. Lewis that Travis and band decided to lovingly adopt as their own. They would go on to play a few shows with Torrent while Greg and Travis bonded over their love of video-game soundtracks. It was a video-game soundtrack that also brought Greg Lesondak and Greg Johnson together. Greg Johnson was scoring the Wii game “Alien Monster Bowling League” and asked Greg Lesondak for help on a track. Greg Lesondak had been gigging heavily every since high school and thought it would be a nice change of pace to help record a track for a video game. Greg Johnson would then send those tracks to Travis to see what he thought of them since Travis was also working at a small online video game company scoring music for them. Travis had just moved to Murrieta, California at this time and would spend his days talking to Greg about music and his nights would be spent with the band in his neighbor Robert’s garage. Robert Pearson saw something in the group and offered his garage as a space for the band to be creative and more importantly.. to be loud. Robert even showed the group to his brother-in-law, Chris Adams, who had been busy in Hamburg, Germany inventing automatic tuning “Robot Guitar”. </p>
<p>This is where fate through a curve ball… Beau quit On Being Human. Beau had grown anxious and needed a change. He enrolled at Biola University for Music and him and a couple other members also left the group. Travis was devastated, he had just recently decided to pick up the singing duties on the groups new “8 bit EP” and the EP was doing well enough that a young drummer named Gustin Flaig had heard about it all the way down in south Orange County through a friend of a friend and thought it was unique.. but Travis was left with just half a band. It was then that his old-video-game-soundtrack-loving friend Greg Johnson was looking for a change too. After Torrent called it a day and Greg graduated college, he was left with no direction and a lot of time on his hands. He sent a simple message to Travis on Myspace asking if he needed a guitar player and Travis said yes. Greg joined the band, replacing Beau on guitar, and started rehearsing in Robert’s garage. It was only two weeks later that Travis got a call that would change everyone’s lives. After much lobbying by Robert, Chris Adams wanted to bring the band to Germany to record an album. Three months after graduating college and a little over a month in the band, Greg Johnson got on a plane with Travis and the other members of the band and flew to Hamburg, Germany. The news got back to Beau and it shook him. He wanted a change of scenery but little did he know that by leaving On Being Human he had just given that opportunity to Greg… but fate wasn’t done yet. </p>
<p>On Being Human was hard at work on their first album, “To Light the Coals of Hearts”, in Hamburg. They were recording in a fantastic studio with all the support they could ever want. Things aren’t always as they seem though, the bass player at the time wasn’t happy in the new situation and decided to return home. Travis and Greg were distraught as they thought they might lose this huge opportunity. How were they suppose to find a new member while they were 6,000 miles away from home? They had one option.. They called Beau and asked him to rejoin the band on the bass. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Fast forward to January of 2010 and the release of On Being Human’s first full length album. “To Light the Coals of Hearts” was both the debut of the band and the culmination of the history of where they had been. They threw a release party and Greg Johnson picked a new brand new band that he had produced to open for them. I Am Cassettes was new rock group that consisted of close friends, including the lead guitarist Greg Lesondak. Like Beau and Greg Johnson before him, Greg Lesondak would share the stage with On Being Human with his previous group. </span></p><p>Two years later, On Being Human had gone through another member change and was left needing a guitarist for a music video they were about to shoot for a song called “Unforgiving Sea”. The song was written for a film produced by Innovation Films in Qatar and that On Being Human had been scoring. Greg Johnson called his old friend and asked Greg Lesondak and Matthew Marquez, of Heartist, to come out to a dairy farm in the middle of the night and shoot a music video. It was then that everything started to click, Greg Lesondak wanted a change of pace and On Being Human was his way of doing just that. After Greg Lesondak joined the group they went out to track a new EP that Innovation Films executive produced. The band was going to do it all themselves but they needed a studio to record at. Greg Johnson remembered “Alchemy Studios” in Murrieta, California from back in the “To Light the Coals of Hearts” days as they had overdubbed the vocal for “Tidal Wave” there. Greg got the number of the owner from Robert Pearson and left a voicemail for a man named Arnold.</p>
<p>Arnold Lanni was a Canadian producer famous for producing bands such as Simple Plan, Our Lady Peace and King’s X. He also wrote the number 1 track “When I’m With You” back in the early 80’s for his old band Sheriff. The same year that On Being Human was born, Arnold decided that he needed a change of scenery and moved to Temecula. He set up shop and began working away at  Alchemy Studios. A few years later a group of local musicians called him. He returned Greg’s call and the two began to talk about what On Being Human needed and what Arnold could do for them. Arnold let the band book studio time and they went in to track the self-produced EP “eVe”. The band release “eVe” in January of 2012 and built a name for themselves earning Band of the Month recognitions from Hot Topic, Musicians Friend and Infectious Magazine as well as being labeled one of the best bands from Temecula from CBS Los Angeles. They needed to play more shows in support of “eVe” but they were still in need of a full time drummer. Kevin Garcia of I Am Cassettes had been jamming with Gustin Flaig in his Orange County based group Rebel Revive and decided that Gustin would be a perfect fit for On Being Human. Kevin started to slowly put the idea in Gustin’s head until Gustin decided it needed to happen. After joining On Being Human, Gustin and crew played all around Southern California and even made a trek out to Washington D.C. to play MainStage at Magfest 13 in support of their video game music based cover album “The Humans are Coming Vol.1”. The group built up their own new songs it preparation to release their next full length album “In Search of Adam”. Greg Johnson had been working with Arnold Lanni on his projects at Alchemy Studios and Greg would often joke that Arnold should produce the group’s next LP. It was only a joke as the thought was an impossibility. Then the idea became a plausibility, then a possibility and finally a reality. </p>
<p>That brings us to today. We are in the preproduction phase of our new LP ""In Search of Adam"" and we are wanting to make the best possible record that we can. We want to avoid some of the pitfalls that happen to musicians nowadays so we hired Arnold and his studio in order to make this record the way we believe records are supposed to be made. It would seem that the events that brought us together over the last 10 years were coincidence, but we want believe that they were fate. We don’t know what the next chapter will be but we would love to have each and everyone of our fans be a part of our story. </p>
<p>-On Being Human</p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Our goals</h3><p>To be clear, we are going to make this record happen no matter what! The burden of that is pretty large to bare on just the five of us, so we are simply asking for a little help.  </p><ul>
<li>The amount that we are asking for isn't the full amount of what a record on this scale costs, but we don't necessarily believe we should ask for that much. This record is our responsibility and we take it very seriously. That being said, it costs a lot to do a record with a Diamond selling Producer at a high quality studio with analog gear and a large console! The funds raised will all go to partially paying back the studio costs incurred. </li>
<li>Obviously we are going to hook up our pledgers with new music; but we also have some other things. We are going to be giving away an unreleased recording of an EP that was secret until now! Want us to record your favorite video game track?? Want to come hang in the studio or better yet; want us to produce a song for you in the same studio? Check out the perks below to see what we have to offer! </li>
<li>If we don't reach our go, that will not stop this process! We are already all in and will bare the burden ourselves if need be because we believe that investing in ourselves is the best thing to invest in. </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>We are going to make ""In Search of Adam"" and take it everywhere we can. This is the all-in moment for us and we believe that these songs with the help of Arnold Lanni will help us turn On Being Human into a career for all of us. Every record we've made has pushed us further up and further out, so with the friends and fans we've made over the years we believe that gravity will take it's course. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Humans are Coming Vol. 2</h3><p>Some of you may only know us from our video-game based cover album ""The Humans are Coming"" on Retrowaretv.com. We want to know that part of this campaign will directly help in the creation of the 2nd album of covers. Some of the perks will lead to the direct involvement of what songs we will pick for the next album. It can be your favorite track from your favorite game or a medley of your choosing! We see it all as part and parcel to what On Being Human is trying to achieve. </p></div>","In Search of Adam

-On Being HumanOur goalsTo be clear, we are going to make this record happen no matter what! The burden of that is pretty large to bare on just the five of us, so we are simply asking for a little help.  
The amount that we are asking for isn't the full amount of what a record on this scale costs, but we don't necessarily believe we should ask for that much. This record is our responsibility and we take it very seriously. That being said, it costs a lot to do a record with a Diamond selling Producer at a high quality studio with analog gear and a large console! The funds raised will all go to partially paying back the studio costs incurred. 
Obviously we are going to hook up our pledgers with new music; but we also have some other things. We are going to be giving away an unreleased recording of an EP that was secret until now! Want us to record your favorite video game track?? Want to come hang in the studio or better yet; want us to produce a song for you in the same studio? Check out the perks below to see what we have to offer! 
If we don't reach our go, that will not stop this process! We are already all in and will bare the burden ourselves if need be because we believe that investing in ourselves is the best thing to invest in. 
The ImpactWe are going to make ""In Search of Adam"" and take it everywhere we can. This is the all-in moment for us and we believe that these songs with the help of Arnold Lanni will help us turn On Being Human into a career for all of us. Every record we've made has pushed us further up and further out, so with the friends and fans we've made over the years we believe that gravity will take it's course. The Humans are Coming Vol. 2Some of you may only know us from our video-game based cover album ""The Humans are Coming"" on Retrowaretv.com. We want to know that part of this campaign will directly help in the creation of the 2nd album of covers. Some of the perks will lead to the direct involvement of what songs we will pick for the next album. It can be your favorite track from your favorite game or a medley of your choosing! We see it all as part and parcel to what On Being Human is trying to achieve.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

What you get:  Donation of $10 or more = CR sticker
                          Donation of $30 or more = CR sunglasses 
                          Donation of $100 or more = Signed CR CD
                          Donation of $1000 or more = Signed CD, t-shirt, sunglasses, stickers, & a Surfers Bible
