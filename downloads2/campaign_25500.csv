<p>Thank you for visiting this campaign! My name is Stephanie Svec and I'm an actor and writer living in Washington DC. I have written and will be performing a one woman show at the Capital Fringe Festival in DC this summer. This show is about the role of fear in my life and how it has motivated my behavior. Through vignettes, stand up comedy and song, I explore how I got to where I find myself again: afraid. But this time, the behavior it's motivating is my writing this show. And that's where you come in. I need your help to be able to pay all the people who helped me make ths happen. There are people who believed in my vision for this show and that I could do it. I want them and their work to be compensated as they should be. </p>
<p><span>Here is the real impact of your money: I realized I hadn't fundraised and tried to do it all myself because I wasn't sure that a show about me was worth other people contributing. So when you contribute you are saying it's worth it.</span></p>
<p>I am asking to raise $1500 by July 13th. That is 150 people donating just $10 each. That's it! With this money, I will be able to pay my for my director, my stage manager, all my designers and for my marketing. With this money, I will not be losing money by creating and performing this show.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And if you cannot donate money, don't worry, I've been there! But please tell your friends about it too. Share this via email, Facebook and Twitter. And by all means, if you come to the show, please wait for me after so I can thank you personally. </p>

<p>Todd Charron is a Toronto sketch and improv performer, who created Follow Your Fear Day in 2012. This summer we want to make it bigger and better, with particpants for all over working to ""follow their fear"".</p>
<p>By contributing to this project you will help Todd launch Follow Your Fear Day across the country. Anyone can participate in Follow Your Fear Day, all you need to do is commit to doing something that you've always wanted to do, but maybe have never had the push to do.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $3000 to help fund the performance on August 24, 2013.  The funds will go towards everything we need to get this show off the ground - marketing, theatre space, lighting, sound, cookies for the guy running the light and sound. </p>
<p>Contributors will be invited to ""follow their fear"" as part of the project. More details on how to get involved are available at <a href=""http://www.followyourfearday.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.followyourfearday.com</a> </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
For most people there is something they've always wanted to do, that thing that we defer, re-prioritize, or push into the “someday/maybe” pile where it just sits and gathers dust until we eventually decide that its ""too late"" to ever do it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What if there was something that gave people that push, that little bit of motivation they needed to stand up and do the thing that scares them? Thats what Follow Your Fear Day is all about - encouraging everyone to stand up and do the thing they've always wanted.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Even if you can't donate, spread the word about Follow Your Fear Day! We all have something that we've wanted to accomplish, so what better time than this summer to stand up and dust off those fears!

<p class=""p1"">Melissa Aston is a member of the pioneering Therapeutic Clown Program at British Columbia’s Children’s Hospital in Vancouver, BC, and is a professionally trained clown. She brings caring fun to sick children and their families with sensitivity and foolishness. She has been training with this program since 2012, and is now a full member of the team, performing as the DisOrderly, Cosmo. This program was started in 1994 by the inimitable Paul Hooson (Doc Willikers, Funnybone Doctor), and joined 6 years ago by the awesome Sand Northrup (Fizzie the Fryzziotherapist). Our current project is to send Melissa on a 8 day professional development tour of similar programs in Toronto, Ontario, and Montreal, Quebec, to meet and network with other professionals in the field. We need your help. </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Our aim is to raise $750, to cover Melissa’s expenses for the journey. Without your help, this opportunity may not be possible. Luckily, the airfare and hosting has been covered, but all other expenses are out of pocket, so we are turning to the greater circus and arts-loving community out there. In exchange for your support, Melissa is offering a live clown performance for those in her community, clown scream outs,  a selection of signed clown thank you cards, and a small selection of hand made professional clown noses, with possibly more perks to come.  Your contribution will go a long way to helping her on this new journey, networking and connecting with other therapeutic clown professionals in Canada, and supporting the medical clown field in our endeavor to bring humour and fun to health care facilities in this growing profession.</span></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""1"">Britton Buttrill and Dustin Brown first met at Oglethorpe University, as undergraduate students involved in student theater. Britton and Dustin worked together to produce Britton’s first one acts on Oglethorpe’s Lupton stage. After graduation, Britton has written both one acts and full length plays, which have received staged readings around Atlanta. In Britton’s latest play, <i>Uffizi</i>, an American couple trapped in a claustrophobic hotel room in Florence, Italy in the middle of December decides to take desperate measures in order to reconcile their deep sexual scars. Britton’s play was selected for the Winter 2012 Strawberry One Act Festival in New York and will have its World Premiere in New York City on March 4th. <br/></font></p>

This is a unique opportunity for Britton and gives him the chance to jump-start his career as a playwright.</font></p>

Through Oglethorpe’s theatre program, Britton was able to stage five of his plays, spurning his passion for playwriting. He was able to study with Alliance Theatre dramaturge Jennifer Hebblethwaite and Atlanta playwright Jim Grimsley. Oglethorpe also afforded him the opportunity to study playwriting at Oxford University through the Washington International Studies Council, and the University gave him the opportunity to direct a full production of <i>Agnes of God</i> on the Conant stage. Oglethorpe directly prepared Britton for a life in the professional theatre world through internships with both Fabrefaction Theatre Company and Georgia Shakespeare. Because of the skill-set learned through these internships, he was able to become a full Artistic Associate with Pinch n' Ouch Theatre after graduation. Since graduating, Britton won Horizon Theatre’s New South Young Playwright’s Festival and has since received professional staged readings at both Horizon Theatre and The Drive-By Theatre Project.

<p>My writing partner and cherished friend, Stanley Jay Gelber and I are tremendously grateful that you have chosen us as possible benefactors of your generosity. We thank you in advance!</p>
<p>Stan and I have been in the creative arts collectively for 110 years. For six of those years, we've been writing and refining LORD TOM, the Musical, with our goal to see it produced on Broadway. You can help us get there!  Below is a little bit about each of us so that you know who we are in the creative arts world.  Now let us introduce you to <em>LORD TOM, the Musical</em>.</p>
<h3>HERE'S TO THE HEROES!</h3>
<p><em>LORD TOM, the Musical</em> is the story of TOM, our hero, and his community of family and friends. TOM is at once human and mythic: fashioned on one of the most unforgettable men in American literature, the heroic character of TOM in Harriet Beecher Stowe's seminal novel <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> (UTC). UTC sold 300,000 thousand copies in 1852, occasioning <em>Putnam's Magazine</em> to declare: ""Never since books were first printed has the success of <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> been equaled; the history of literature contains nothing parallel to it nor approaching it.""</p>
<p>UTC is a masterpiece of social reform which helped end slavery, start the Civil War, and change the course of our nation's history. Indeed, Abraham Lincoln is quoted as saying to Harriet Beecher Stowe, ""So this is the little lady who wrote the novel that made this great war.""</p>
<p>Throughout Broadway history, rich, epic novels like <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> have been converted from the page to the stage, translating eloquently into the musical theatre idiom and earning long, illustrious and successful runs on Broadway. They include <em>Les Miserables, The Phantom of the Opera, The Secret Garden, Lost in the Stars, Ragtime, Showboat</em>, among others.</p>
<p>We believe <em>LORD TOM, the Musical--</em>the phoenix rising out of UTC--will do the same. Broadway is ready for <em>LORD TOM, the Musical. </em>It gives a voice to the voiceless in today's world. It reminds us that we are all responsible for preserving and protecting our individual and collective freedom. It reminds us to live together united, with compassion and forgiveness and mutual regard for our differences, knowing that together we make up a more diverse, unique and irreplaceable family of man than apart. It reminds us that at our core we are all the same!</p>
<p>Music speaks to all people. Now is the time for this message to be rekindled through the music and story <em>of LORD TOM, the Musical.</em></p>
<h3>SUCCESSFUL TRACK RECORD:</h3>
<p>Thanks to contributors like you, last November <em>LORD TOM, the Musical</em> funded a CD of 12 song selections from the score of 25 songs, and mounted an informal, in-house reading with a cast of stellar Broadway performers. In this reading, we read the book and sang the score together for the first time! And guess what? People laughed and people cried and they gave the cast a standing ovation at the end of Act 2, because they were so moved by the subject matter. We were thrilled and encouraged! We now enter Phase Two of our fund raising efforts.</p>
<h3>PHASE TWO</h3>
<p>In order to mount LORD TOM on Broadway, we need seasoned producers who know how to raise millions of dollars. So, we have to get these producers into a theatre to watch our staged reading, in order to commit to optioning our project for a Broadway production.</p>
<p>So, we are fund raising to self-produce two consecutive Actors Equity Approved public staged readings with the same Broadway cast and a seasoned director, we will hire. We have hired a general manager to oversee expenses and handle the daily nuts and bolts of the business end of Phase Two. We still need to pay the balance for the theatre, hire the director, pay the musical director, the casting director, the graphic designer, pay the studio for the rehearsals, pay the actors and there's more! This requires thousands of dollars to achieve: $22,500.00 to be exact. Here's our Budget.</p>
<h3>THE FUNDING WE NEED AND WHAT IT BUYS</h3>
<p>LORD TOM, THE MUSICAL BUDGET FOR TWO STAGED READINGS IN NEW YORK CITY, MAY 20 &amp; 21 AT THE PETER JAY SHARP THEATRE ON THEATRE ROW</p>
<p>$9500.00............Creative Team (Director, Musical Director, Casting Director)</p>

<p>$1050.00............Scripts, CD tapes, Presentation Programs</p>
<p>$1000.00............Insurance, Payroll processing</p>
<h3><strong>IMPACT</strong></h3>
<p><em>LORD TOM, the Musical</em> is a new American musical that meets American history in a progressive, game-changing way.  Its inspirational story has never been done as a book musical with an original score in either the 20th or 21st century.</p>
<p>Its themes are legion and legendary - the triumph of kindness over hatred, of joy over horror, of family over disengagement, of unity over division, and of freedom over bondage.</p>
<p>It touches our senses and enriches our lives through its 21st century depiction of Stowe's big time iconic characters. TOM, our protagonist, is a bold, charismatic, human...struggling to return to his family...with a selfless spirit...and a humanity which is striking!</p>
<p><em>LORD TOM, the Musical</em> is a platform for illuminating the issues that people still contend with in our society and our world today, such as:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Education of the oppressed</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Evolution of freedom</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Equal rights for all in a colorblind world</p>
<p>Our protagonist gives his life to insure the freedom of others, much like Coalhouse Walker in <em>Ragtime</em>, Kim in <em>Miss Saigon</em>, and real-life heroes Martin Luther King, Jr. in Memphis, TN, and the school principal at Sandy Hook.</p>
<p><em>LORD TOM, the Musical</em> is a true and very classic American story in which is rooted the selfless spirit of man. It honors the principles upon which our country was founded: liberty and justice for all.</p>
<p>You will cry with joy and laugh with tears as you identify with its iconic and human characters.</p>
<p>And, you will love the rewards: which include the opportunity to see <em>LORD TOM, the Musical</em> on the Broadway stage!  <strong>All</strong> contributors will be listed as a ""theater angel"" in all of our promotional materials, as we diligently move forward toward reaching our next objective--the mounting of LORD TOM, the Musical on Broadway!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
    Greetings, my name is Jeff Ingram and I am the Director of The New World Children's Theatre, a program of Standing Rock Cultural Arts (<a href=""http://www.standingrock.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.standingrock.net</a>).  Each year, we put out a call for students to write, design, build sets, make posters, rehearse and perform an original theatrical production.  We are now in our twentieth year and the program has created 26 original plays.<br/><p>     We decided to embark on a campaign to raise funds because we believe the New World Children's Theatre program is at the core of our mission To Build Community Through The Arts.  This program nurtures the spirit of creativity and allows children the opportunity to bring their ideas to the stage.  I received my degree in Theatre and French in 1987 from Ohio State University and have read many, many plays in my day.   The plays the kids write are among the best.  Although I never expected to be involved in Children's Theatre, I've found the experience to be as rewarding and enlightening as it is frustrating and absurd.  A little bit of money goes a long way with this program.  The sense of empowerment for the students in this group has long lasting effects and the productions build skills that most remember for th rest of their lives.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>    We need $7,000.00 to make this project a success.  Our funding comes from many sources including The DuBois Family Foundation, The Christenson Foundation, local businesses, tuition from students, and private individuals.  But it's never enough to cover all the expenses. </p>
<p>    We are hoping to raise $800 to pay for art supplies including paint, brushes, canvases for backdrops, as well as to help cover the fees for an art director and administrative personnel for this program.  For your contribution, you will receive:</p>
<p>$20  - two tickets to the performance in May</p>
<p>$30 - two tickets and listing in the program</p>
<p>$50 - all of the above and a t shirt of the production</p>
<p>$100 - 4 tickets to the performance, 2 t shirts, a listing in the program, a DVD of the performance, and a signed copy of the script</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>     Your contribution has an enormous impact on the children in our community.  The children are our future.  When we give them the tools to become leaders, to become productive citizens working together toward a common goal, to respect each other and solve conflicts, to realize a dream from concept to implementation on stage, we offer them one of the best gifts you can give a child, self esteem and cooperative ideas.</p>
<p>     Several of our students have grown to become exceptional professionals in the performing arts.  Jessica Lee Mayfield is a nationally acclaimed recording artist and Anya Clingman just completed her MFA studies at Depaul University and is teaching theatre in Chicago.</p>

<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 10px; font-weight: normal;"">Beautiful City Theatre is a non-profit organization that seeks to create and celebrate community through the sharing and exploration of theatre processes and performances.</span>
</div>
<div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 10px; font-weight: normal;""> </span></div>
<div>For our first production, we are presenting Godspell, a rock musical that will be performed in Old Montreal's Centaur Theatre in January 2013. We will also be holding a Gala in honour of our supporters on Friday January 11, 2013 (to be held at the MAI: Montreal Arts Interculturels). </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Beautiful City Theatre was founded to create a space that challenges and enriches its participants’ understanding of relationships and humanity. Godspell embodies the essence of BCT as it explores and celebrates life, play, and the building of community.</div>
<div>
<h3>What's the Cause:</h3>
<p>In order to make this production possible, we need rehearsal space that is large enough to accommodate 13 cast members, 4 artistic leaders and 3 stage managers. In order for these creative minds to be able to work together and truly explore, they need space to roam free!</p>
<p>We are asking for the exact amount that we need for rehearsal space, which is $1921.45 (Indiegogo won't let us include the 45 cents... but don't worry, we've got it covered!)</p>
<p>Even with generous donations from our studios, we are still paying a minimum of $10/hour for the time we spend in rehearsal.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Can Offer:</h3>
<p>For any donation over $10: Your name will appear in the program for Godspell (if desired). This buys us a whole wonderful hour of rehearsal, and we can't tell you how much we appreciate it.</p>
<p>$50: Poster signed by the entire cast.</p>
<p>$100: Two tickets to our Gala event.</p>
<p>$150: Two tickets to our Gala event and a signed poster by the entire cast.</p>

<p>$500: Two free tickets to show, two tickets to our Gala event, a poster signed by the entire cast, and a personal song dedication to the donator at our Gala (song of your choice!).</p>
<p>$1921: All of the above, a bottle of wine to celebrate your generosity, a batch of freshly baked cookies for your warm heart, our undying love (better than a tax receipt!), a handmade pop-up card, and fulfillment of your New Year's resolution to donate to the arts.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Sci-Fi on the Rock is Newfoundland's largest science fiction convention and is entering its 7th year. We have a great selection of guests coming this year: Dominic Keating, Mike Dopud, Gary Jones, Dean Haglund and Ginny McQueen. Getting these folks out to St. John's, NL is costly. Flights, hotels, meals...it gets expensive! We want to keep offering some great guests, wonderful workshops, fantastic film festival, crazy costumes and other awesome events. In order to do so, we need YOUR help!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We want to offer a fun time and raise some needed funds before those guests get to St. John's. We've gotten the privilege of putting on Star Trek Live; The Trouble with Tribbles. We're doing this as a dramatic reading (meaning that costumes and props are involved as well as some great voice acting). We also have some additional surprises up our sleeves too!</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your support on this project will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rental of AV equipment</li>
<li>Rental of performance space</li>
<li>Costumes, props, scripts, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the agreement with the school that is hosting our performance, the rental fees are going directly to the school's lunch program.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The show is all about the celebration of science fiction, and the reach for something greater than ourselves. That is what we are trying to do with this show; help build our community of nerds, geeks, gamers, cosplayers, Trekkers and other fun and fantastic people. With your help, we'll be able to continue to provide a service to this community, and we can build on our success. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone is able to contribute financially. You can help us make a difference by:</p>

<li>Telling your friends about Sci-Fi on the Rock and Star Trek Live: The Trouble with Tribbles fundraiser</li>

<h3>The Orphans Feast</h3>
<p>Hello!  We are The Monocle.  We are a performing arts ensemble from Kansas City, MO.  We are producers, composers, writers, singers, and actors who have joined together to create new musical and theatrical works.</p>
<p>We are preparing our debut production, an original musical theatre experience entitled “The Orphans Feast.”  Inspired by the meals shared by friends during the holidays, the story follows various characters as they pursue the meaning of family through music, comedy, drama, and time travel. It features original music and new takes on holiday classics by a live band with some of the best jazz players in the city. It also features zombies. What's not to love?</p>
<p>It will be playing at The Arts Asylum, 1000 E 9th St KCMO:</p>
<ul>
<li>11/30 - 8:00 pm</li>
<li>12/1 - 7:00 pm and 10:00 pm</li>
<li>12/2 - 2:00 pm</li>
</ul>
<p>This play is the culmination of a year of planning and hard work. Our goal of creating a funny, beautiful, and compelling play is almost complete.  But we are missing one vital ingredient.</p>
<p>Money.</p>
<p>To stage the play at its full potential, we need to hire professional musicians, actors, and crew.  To allow these professionals to focus their time and talent on the production – rather than split their attention between this and a second or third job – we need to pay them fair, livable wages.</p>
<p>The only way we can do this is with your help.</p>
 </div>
<div>
<h3><strong>How Much Does It Cost to Stage a Play? </strong></h3>
<p>We have hired 11 professionals:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 actors</li>
<li>4 musicians</li>
<li>1 assistant director</li>
<li>1 stage manager</li>
</ul>
<p>Each professional will spend 88 hours working on this production:<strong><br/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>16 days of rehearsals x 3 hrs/day = 48 hrs</li>
<li>4 days of tech and dress rehearsals x 6 hrs/day = 24 hrs</li>
<li>4 shows x 4 hrs/show = 16 hrs</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Impact Will Your Financial Contribution Have?</h3>
<p>The Monocle was founded by four KC performing artists:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Nathan Granner</strong> - Producer, writer, and internationally know operatic tenor.  Appeared as one of the American Tenors on the Sony Masterworks imprint.  Produced ""A Night With Virgil T"" in conjunction with PBS at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts in Kansas City.</li>
<li>
<strong>Katie Gilchrist</strong> - producer, director, and nationally recognized actor.  Founding member and producer of The New Century Follies.  Actor in numerous Kansas City productions, including The Unicorn's staging of Everyday Rapture in it's post-Broadway national debut. </li>
<li>
<strong>Shay Estes</strong> - jazz, brazilian, and fado vocalist, arranger, and actor.  Leads her own jazz quartet, and performs with The People's Liberation Big Band and Snuff Jazz.  Founding member of Fado Novato and Mistura Fina.  Performs and arranges with The Barclay Martin Ensemble.</li>
<li>
<strong>Christian Hankel</strong> - composer, producer, and performer.  Founding member and songwriter for Alacartoona and The Hillary Watts Riot.  Writer, producer, composer, and actor in ""The Oil Boiler.""  Scriptwriter and actor in Alacartoona's film ""Night Is the Mirror,"" and stage play ""Bought &amp; Souled.""  Actor and composer for ""Sexing Hitler.""</li>
</ul>
<p>Over and over, we’ve seen first hand the power that music and theatre have to bring people of varying beliefs and backgrounds together, to celebrate, to laugh, to feel love and loss.  And over and over again, we’ve worked with amazing artists who pour their time and effort into scripts and songs, often with no more compensation than the love of creating good art.</p>
<p>We founded The Monocle with two goals in mind:  1.  to create a production team capable of staging full-length professional-grade works of theatre, musical theatre, and opera, and 2. to build a self-sustaining performing arts company that can provide artistically satisfying and fairly compensated work to performers.</p>
<p>Your financial contribution today will help us stage The Orphans Feast in a way that provides artistically satisfying, financially viable work for local performing artists.  It will also provide us with seed money to help The Monocle become a self-sustainable, artist-supporting performing arts production company.</p>
<p>Btw, if we don't make our goal, we do have a plan B.  We will trim back the cast to an appropriate number and minimalize props and sets.  It won't be easy to strip down our vision, but we'll put our producers' hats on, roll up our sleeves and make the hard decisions necessary to keep the show viable.</p>

<h3>THANK YOU!</h3></div>","The Orphans Feast
Hello!  We are The Monocle.  We are a performing arts ensemble from Kansas City, MO.  We are producers, composers, writers, singers, and actors who have joined together to create new musical and theatrical works.
We are preparing our debut production, an original musical theatre experience entitled “The Orphans Feast.”  Inspired by the meals shared by friends during the holidays, the story follows various characters as they pursue the meaning of family through music, comedy, drama, and time travel. It features original music and new takes on holiday classics by a live band with some of the best jazz players in the city. It also features zombies. What's not to love?
It will be playing at The Arts Asylum, 1000 E 9th St KCMO:

11/30 - 8:00 pm
12/1 - 7:00 pm and 10:00 pm
12/2 - 2:00 pm

This play is the culmination of a year of planning and hard work. Our goal of creating a funny, beautiful, and compelling play is almost complete.  But we are missing one vital ingredient.
Money.
To stage the play at its full potential, we need to hire professional musicians, actors, and crew.  To allow these professionals to focus their time and talent on the production – rather than split their attention between this and a second or third job – we need to pay them fair, livable wages.
The only way we can do this is with your help.
 

How Much Does It Cost to Stage a Play? 
We have hired 11 professionals:

5 actors
4 musicians
1 assistant director
1 stage manager

Each professional will spend 88 hours working on this production:

16 days of rehearsals x 3 hrs/day = 48 hrs
4 days of tech and dress rehearsals x 6 hrs/day = 24 hrs
4 shows x 4 hrs/show = 16 hrs

At only $10/hr, it will cost $880 for each of these professionals to appear in our show.
11 x $880 = $9,680
And then there are the part time professionals:

6 part time actors
1 part time prop maker
1 part time costumer
1 part time set builder
1 lighting designer
1 sound engineer 

But that's not all:

Space rental - theater and rehearsal space
Advertising - print flyers and buy ads.  Can we afford to hire a graphic designer or do we do it ourselves?  How does that decision impact the effectiveness of our advertising and our ticket sales?
Personnel - ushers, box office help, security. 

Our final budget for this show is just over $12,000.  If we sell 100 seats for all four shows, we will make $4000, leaving another $8000 that we have to cover.  And that's why we're turning to you.

The story, which at times deals with societal intolerance, is not only reflective of the hypocrisies of Victorian England, but of our current cultural views today.
 
The Ensemble Theatre Company of  seeks to bring great works that have been overlooked back to audiences, particularly those that reflect what is going on in today’s society. We also wish to be a place where people can learn their various crafts, as well as introduce new audiences to the enlightening effects of live theatre. Supporting us are such theatre luminaries as SIR DEREK JACOBI, BRIAN BEDFORD, BRIAN MURRAY, and ELI WALLACH, as well as Broadway producers JOHN HABER and RICK HOBARD.
 
The Impact

. 
  
Help us create and reach others with art that has enriched our lives.

 


What We Need & What You Get
 
 
This first campaign is to raise $5,000 to pay for the rights to produce John Gay’s DIVERSIONS & DELIGHTS.
The show has not been done in NYC since 1978, and has rarely been performed since. It will be a real boon to present this work to a new generation of Theatergoers, as well as to those who saw the original production. The play, while quite funny, touches on issues of intolerance that also makes its message relevant and timely.

This mantra motivates our dreams and hopes to reality. Our production is a journey through varying aspects of such dreams, given to the audience through the strength, grace and dexterity of circus arts, dance, theater and multimedia. This project should create awareness not only of the tragedy in Brimfield and the surrounding communities of Western MA, but awareness of the weather effects of global warming in our worldwide communities. It is for this pressing issue that this project must be sustainable and ongoing.</span></font><div><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style="""">Our other mission aims at community renewal through Movement as Metaphorâ„¢. </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style="""">We believe that bringing children and adolescents together through production workshops in theater, circus arts, visual arts and dance plants a new seed of emotional connectivity and renewal much needed in a disaster struck community. Creating theatrical productions is in itself, creating strength in community through the creative process. The workshops are aimed at providing a healthy physical and emotional outlet for youths suffering from post traumatic stress symptoms. </span></font></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000""><br/></font></span></div><div>

The first being the development of Movement as Metaphor youth programs which have been in effect since 2008 in Brimfield and Western MA. This includes training in several forms of dance, acrobatics,circus arts, acting, body conditioning, team awareness and collaboration. The second part of this process is intertwining world class professional performance artists and arts in education professionals into the project to mentor the youth, and guide them through their creative process. In doing this we foster a positive example whilst providing support and inspiration. The next part of the process entails attending rehearsals, hands on studying of production in the fields of multimedia/design, costume design and construction, prop/set design, stage make-up, and rigging safety for aerial arts. This process occurs on a 7hr/day schedule for 4 weeks requiring studio time, safety equipment (such as crash mats), textiles and other supplies. Much of this we have, more of this we desperately need. </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""""><br/></span></font></div>

The best way we can do this is by building a sustainable headquarters for the project which we have begun. Our space wishes to function as a sanctuary and support for emerging and established artists who are invested in devoting their talents to the Brimfield, MA tornado relief and renewal effort as well as for youth arts in education camps and workshops. For this to happen we need to furnish the space with appropriate safety equipment, rigging, acrobatic equipment and sprung dance flooring. </span></font></div>

Bringing this process to aid in disaster relief is an exciting and purposeful endeavor. In order to create a sustainable project we incur a great amount of expense on rehearsal spaces. Bringing workshops and productions into disaster struck areas presents us with the challenge of housing the workshops and performances. We manage these obstacles in 2 ways. Our goal for Movement As Metaphorâ„¢ is to create a facility which workshop students can travel to, and our goal for production is to utilize that same space to create a flexible performance environment which can be site specific and easily transportable for any venue. In order for 'Clear head, Open Heart, Strong Body' to develop into a strong fundraising tool it must be capable of utilizing any space as performance space. An investment into furnishing workshop and rehearsal space is urgent.  </span></font></div>

Safety equipment must be accessible at all times to all students.We are working with several platforms to create animated 2d and 3d projection as a film component to suit the score of 'Clear Head, Open Heart, Strong Body'  by the Kansas City based group Human Cropcircles. We also need to utilize the projector for the projection mapping component of our youth workshops. For the projection to maintain its opacity against our theater's lighting programs we need a 1080dpi 10,000+ lumen projector which we currently do not have. Portable sprung dance flooring is also a necessity, It allows us to bring dance classes safely to any location indoors or outdoors thus creating the flexibility necessary for our production and aiding our ability to bring workshops to those who do not have the ability to leave their areas.</span></font></div>

 A performance art benefit program for the Brimfield, MA tornado victims. 

What we want to do....
We have two distinctive missions with this project. One is to create a contemporary performance production which, once funded and developed will become a benefit performance for the Brimfield, MA tornado victims. The funds we raise will aid in the rebuilding of homes where the insurance does not cover the rebuild.  'Clear Head, Open Heart, Strong Body' is a mantra we apply to both skill set and life. This mantra motivates our dreams and hopes to reality. Our production is a journey through varying aspects of such dreams, given to the audience through the strength, grace and dexterity of circus arts, dance, theater and multimedia. This project should create awareness not only of the tragedy in Brimfield and the surrounding communities of Western MA, but awareness of the weather effects of global warming in our worldwide communities. It is for this pressing issue that this project must be sustainable and ongoing.Our other mission aims at community renewal through Movement as Metaphorâ„¢. We believe that bringing children and adolescents together through production workshops in theater, circus arts, visual arts and dance plants a new seed of emotional connectivity and renewal much needed in a disaster struck community. Creating theatrical productions is in itself, creating strength in community through the creative process. The workshops are aimed at providing a healthy physical and emotional outlet for youths suffering from post traumatic stress symptoms. 
How we plan to do it...
Thus far our plans have evolved in several parts. The first being the development of Movement as Metaphor youth programs which have been in effect since 2008 in Brimfield and Western MA. This includes training in several forms of dance, acrobatics,circus arts, acting, body conditioning, team awareness and collaboration. The second part of this process is intertwining world class professional performance artists and arts in education professionals into the project to mentor the youth, and guide them through their creative process. In doing this we foster a positive example whilst providing support and inspiration. The next part of the process entails attending rehearsals, hands on studying of production in the fields of multimedia/design, costume design and construction, prop/set design, stage make-up, and rigging safety for aerial arts. This process occurs on a 7hr/day schedule for 4 weeks requiring studio time, safety equipment (such as crash mats), textiles and other supplies. Much of this we have, more of this we desperately need. 
Completing the creation of 'Clear head, Open Heart, Strong Body' relies (ofcourse)upon sufficient rehearsal space and time. The best way we can do this is by building a sustainable headquarters for the project which we have begun. Our space wishes to function as a sanctuary and support for emerging and established artists who are invested in devoting their talents to the Brimfield, MA tornado relief and renewal effort as well as for youth arts in education camps and workshops. For this to happen we need to furnish the space with appropriate safety equipment, rigging, acrobatic equipment and sprung dance flooring. 
                                                                   
                                                                What the money is for...
The merging and use of varieties of artistic disciplines presses for evolution within all of those forms individually. Bringing this process to aid in disaster relief is an exciting and purposeful endeavor. In order to create a sustainable project we incur a great amount of expense on rehearsal spaces. Bringing workshops and productions into disaster struck areas presents us with the challenge of housing the workshops and performances. We manage these obstacles in 2 ways. Our goal for Movement As Metaphorâ„¢ is to create a facility which workshop students can travel to, and our goal for production is to utilize that same space to create a flexible performance environment which can be site specific and easily transportable for any venue. In order for 'Clear head, Open Heart, Strong Body' to develop into a strong fundraising tool it must be capable of utilizing any space as performance space. An investment into furnishing workshop and rehearsal space is urgent.  
Safety equipment (crash mats etc)and rigging hardware for aerial acrobatics is an important responsibility. Safety equipment must be accessible at all times to all students.We are working with several platforms to create animated 2d and 3d projection as a film component to suit the score of 'Clear Head, Open Heart, Strong Body'  by the Kansas City based group Human Cropcircles. We also need to utilize the projector for the projection mapping component of our youth workshops. For the projection to maintain its opacity against our theater's lighting programs we need a 1080dpi 10,000+ lumen projector which we currently do not have. Portable sprung dance flooring is also a necessity, It allows us to bring dance classes safely to any location indoors or outdoors thus creating the flexibility necessary for our production and aiding our ability to bring workshops to those who do not have the ability to leave their areas.

With your help we will make the following investments; 
$3500.00/mo rental space for  'The Five Of Us' - 'Clear Head, Open Heart, Strong Body' and Movement as Metaphorâ„¢ project home base. 
$5000.00 for a portable dance flooring system

$1800.00 for two anti-skid mats (these mats do not slide out from underneath the student whilst training) http://www.gymsupply.com/anti-skidmats.aspx
$609.00 for carpeted mats http://www.gymsupply.com/carpetbondedfoam.aspx

$6000.00 - We are aiming to fund a rental for 3-4months. The msrp on this is $59000.00(in our wildest dreams)http://www.panasonic.com/business/projectors/d1...

Western MA has suffered six weather disasters in seven months, three tornados, two tropical storms and a snowstorm in late fall leaving most of the area resembling a pile of trash. Brimfield, MA was one of the hardest areas hit.
State officials say that reimbersements for the tornado damages and October storms could take up to a year despite efforts from congress to expedite the process. 
FranÃ§oise Vorangerâ€™s family lives in Brimfield, MA. It was once a place where the Hybrid Movement Company had a second home, nature and trees to retreat in for aerial and acrobatic training and gardens growing organic produce to sustain artists through long days of practice. A sanctuary. Brimfield is a part of our family and has played an instrumental role in our progress. In August 2011 FranÃ§oise, Jillian, Ronnie, Ziporah and Joanna said prayer for the land and the people of Brimfield.
Hence, the project title â€˜The five of usâ€™. This project seeks not only to rebuild homes, but to renew lives and refresh a hurting community. It begins with your donation.

<em>What</em> is Time Crawlers...?</h3>
<p><em>The</em> <em>Time Crawlers Save the World</em> began as Gina Stevensen's senior thesis project, produced by NYU/Tisch School of the Arts/Drama Department/Experimental Theatre Wing. Under the direction of Brooklyn-based theater artist Christopher Bowser, the play won first place at Manhattan Repertory Theatre’s LONG One Act Competition in March of 2012. The Time Crawlers Save the World will be seen next in conjunction with The Looking Glass space grant program at Looking Glass Theatre in NYC.</p>
<p>Jinx is a girl who loves words. When the apocalypse destroys the world, she escapes underground and buries herself in her dictionary, looking for a sign—but discovers time travel instead. Along with three supernerds and a talking cat, Jinx begins an adventure that will force her to face her own frightening future. This is a play about courage, adventure, and loss; a growing-up story for audiences young and old.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>About three years ago, Anna found a nonfiction book at The Strand about a little-known woman robber in 1920s Brooklyn named Celia Cooney. Poor and pregnant, all Celia wanted was to get a little more money to give her baby a nicer life than she and her husband Ed could provide. Their solution: rob a grocery store. Of course, just one grocery store spiraled into two, then four, until they found themselves deeper than they intended.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Celia's story made such an impact on Anna that she pitched an idea to Britt: Anna would write book and lyrics, and Britt the music, for a musical adaptation. They started work on it, and eventually had enough material to apply to the New York International Fringe Festival - and got in! Now they need to fund their production to show everyone how wonderful Celia Cooney is.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are assembling a crack creative team to help us shape what is now just words and music on paper into a living, breathing musical. Theater is a collaborative medium, and we <span style=""font-style: italic;"">absolutely cannot do this without you guys</span>, our producers!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3>
<p>Putting on a show, even a little show like ours, takes money. And even a little bit helps. For example, $5 can pay for copies of the script. $20 from you could buy us an hour of rehearsal space in a studio. (We want our show to be great, so we're going to need plenty of those!) $150 could get us wigs for all our girls. $600 can cover the FringeNYC registration fee.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>We know you can't all give us $5000 or even $100. But if you donate $5 and then tell 5 friends to donate $5, well, that's like $25 more you're responsible for! Think of the possibilities! What we're saying is - tell your friends.<br/>

<p>When we looked at the children who were
coming to our organization for the first time, we found that
almost all of them were of Japanese descent,
either born here or brought here when they were very young. We
thought that these children, growing
up in this society and culture, might eventually forget their own background, and might well
have identity issues as they grow
up. We wanted to give them a chance to experience their roots by using
our own disciplines, the performing arts.  In this way we came upon the idea of a
dance/theater/music production based on Japanese folk tales.  We wanted to include as many
different people as possible who wished
to join this project, and to include the
children who take our classes.  In this
way, everybody would be able to present what he or
she is best at, at the same time that a Japanese folk tale unfolds.
This is how the Arts Cure Folktale Project was
born.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/875418/files/20140922191315-MyPriPri02.05.12_s.jpg?1411438395"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3>Our Projects</h3>
<p>So far, we have presented two stories on stage,
""Urashima Taro"", about a young fisherman who saves
a bullied turtle and then meets and falls in love
with a princess of the deep sea, and
""Kaguya-Hime"", a mysterious, beautiful woman born out of a
bamboo stalk on the earth who eventually goes back to her home on the
moon.  In the course of
creating each production, we were overwhelmed with the beauty of our
folktales that we thought we knew so well. We realized that
this project inspires not only children but also adults of all

We're running this show in the Motel Theatre from <b>October 22nd through November 1st</b>. </p>
<p>The show takes the form of a lecture about serial killers, though as it progresses, it takes a series of progressively darker turns, and the audience finds themselves in the midst of what promises to be a scary night in the theatre. If you'd like to read more about the show, please visit our<b> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/320484451469509"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook event page</a></b>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why an Indiegogo Campaign?</h3>
<p>This show is entirely centered around our ability to create a scary experience for the audience. In order to do this, it was important for us to produce the show in a small, intimate theatre where you're up close and personal with the performance. However, that choice also comes with limitations, as we can only sell about 40 tickets per performance.</p>
<p>In order to bring out all the scares, we require a slew of special effects and equipment, including specialized stage weapons, blood effects, night vision goggles and more - and these things are quite expensive. Our box office revenue alone won't provide what we need to successfully produce the show. </p>
<p>As a new artistic collective, we're operating without any government funding or established revenue sources, and so we're seeking your support in order to help us create this unique theatrical experience for audiences in Calgary, while offering what we feel are some very exciting perks in the process.</p>

</div><div> <p>We've set a <b>fundraising goal of $1500.00</b>, which will go toward the cost of the special effects used and the running costs of the show.</p>
<p>In exchange for your donation, we're able to provide our donors some special <i>Bone House</i>-related experiences, including admission to an exclusive, donors-only, <b>behind-the-scenes presentation</b> where we'll show off the special effects and equipment used in the show.</p>
<p>And if you really want to have some fun, we have perks which also include the opportunity to bring an unsuspecting friend with you to the show, where <b>we'll include their name and other personal information in the show</b> in a way that will really bring on the chills and will not soon be forgotten!</p>

</div></div>","What is The Bone House? The Bone House is a spine-chilling, immersive theatrical experience written by Edmonton playwright Marty Chan and being produced by a new Calgary-based artistic collective called Apparition Theatre. We're running this show in the Motel Theatre from October 22nd through November 1st. 
The show takes the form of a lecture about serial killers, though as it progresses, it takes a series of progressively darker turns, and the audience finds themselves in the midst of what promises to be a scary night in the theatre. If you'd like to read more about the show, please visit our Facebook event page.

Why an Indiegogo Campaign?
This show is entirely centered around our ability to create a scary experience for the audience. In order to do this, it was important for us to produce the show in a small, intimate theatre where you're up close and personal with the performance. However, that choice also comes with limitations, as we can only sell about 40 tickets per performance.
In order to bring out all the scares, we require a slew of special effects and equipment, including specialized stage weapons, blood effects, night vision goggles and more - and these things are quite expensive. Our box office revenue alone won't provide what we need to successfully produce the show. 
As a new artistic collective, we're operating without any government funding or established revenue sources, and so we're seeking your support in order to help us create this unique theatrical experience for audiences in Calgary, while offering what we feel are some very exciting perks in the process.
What We Need & What You Get
 We've set a fundraising goal of $1500.00, which will go toward the cost of the special effects used and the running costs of the show.
In exchange for your donation, we're able to provide our donors some special Bone House-related experiences, including admission to an exclusive, donors-only, behind-the-scenes presentation where we'll show off the special effects and equipment used in the show.
And if you really want to have some fun, we have perks which also include the opportunity to bring an unsuspecting friend with you to the show, where we'll include their name and other personal information in the show in a way that will really bring on the chills and will not soon be forgotten!
Who We Are
 We're a team with a lot of past experience in producing independent theatre, and it's our hope that Apparition Theatre can create other great theatrical experiences for a variety of artists and audiences in the future.
Apparition Theatre currently consists of Simon Mallett, Mike Griffin, Olivia Brooks, Justin Michael Carriere, Mark Ikeda, Brianna Johnston and Tyler Longmire. We'd all be immensely grateful for your support of our project.

Now we have a chance to produce the play Blithe Spirit at the Julie Harris stage this October. It will be our first ""real"" production, performed Friday through Sunday for three weeks.

<p>I was 8 years old when I took my first dance class. The first dance I learned and performed was cowgirl themed, it was silly and I loved it. This was nearly 13 years ago. I loved the way I felt when I danced. I loved people watching me dance. I loved the focus and freedom dance required. I loved how connected it made me with my body. Movement became my first language and my way of processing and interpreting the world. Dance made sense when everything else didn't. It held me together when I felt like falling apart. Dance was me and I was dance.</p>
<p><br/></p>For many years I danced in my hometown's studio's student companies and performed regularly. I developed a passion for choreography and began creating dances for the annual student showcases. From those showcases I was offered several jobs teaching regular classes for local dance studios and opportunities to perform and choreograph for local professional dance companies - all when I was just 15 years old.</div><div>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">When I turned 16, I suffered from a herniated disc, which pressed onto my spinal cord, aggravating my sciatic nerve and causing searing pain down my right leg. I couldn't walk for several weeks, which meant dance was out of the question. Naturally, this immobility caused me to become depressed and angry.

<h3><strong>Every semester at NYU Tisch School of the Arts, students have the opportunity to propose a show to produce. When approved, the team gets the opportunity to put on a completely student-run show. </strong></h3>
<p><strong>As part of the Fall 2012 Gap season at the NYU Tisch School of the Arts, we are presenting Sarah Ruhl's <em>Passion Play. </em></strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>the play</h3>
<p>Imagine taking on the role of the most famous figure in history, year after year. In <em>Passion Play</em>, we see the pressures placed on communities throughout history as they attempt to reenact the Passion of Christ. </p>
<p>A three act epic with deep historical roots, religious themes, political notes, and profound emotional capacity, <em>Passion Play</em> is a meaty text for both actors and designers. With eleven parts that travel through Elizabethan England, Hitler's Germany, and post-Vietnam America, the script lends itself to both challenging individual character work and strong ensemble-building.</p>
<p>We believe the best way to learn about theatre is by doing it. This fall, we will produce a challenging piece of theatre with a team comprised completely of students. </p>
<p><em>""I don’t know if this country needs more religion or less of it. Seems to me everyone needs a good night’s sleep. That way we’d all wake up for real in the morning. It’s good to be awake. When you’re awake you can fight for what you believe in, no matter what costume you’re wearing.""</em></p>
<h3>
<em><br/></em><strong>the mission</strong>
</h3>
<p>Director's Note:</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why I love <em>Passion Play. </em>I love the scale of it: three acts, roughly twenty scenes apiece, that span four hundred plus years of history. I love the language—how it’s poetic, poignant, contemporary, clever, and funny all at once. I love that there are rich historical backdrops, but the play isn’t about them; it’s about the people living within them. I love that Ruhl’s focus on the individual makes big ideas about the human condition seem easier to tackle. And I love that this play begs us to think about the pressures we put on ourselves. I find that I—and I think many people pursing the arts—feel constant pressure to live up to something, to amount to something, to work towards something, even when I don’t know what that something is. Where do these desired effects or ideals come from? I’d like to use this play to better understand the pressure that seems to dominate the lives of many of the people I know and love.</p>

</div></div>","Every semester at NYU Tisch School of the Arts, students have the opportunity to propose a show to produce. When approved, the team gets the opportunity to put on a completely student-run show. 
As part of the Fall 2012 Gap season at the NYU Tisch School of the Arts, we are presenting Sarah Ruhl's Passion Play. 
 
the play
Imagine taking on the role of the most famous figure in history, year after year. In Passion Play, we see the pressures placed on communities throughout history as they attempt to reenact the Passion of Christ. 
A three act epic with deep historical roots, religious themes, political notes, and profound emotional capacity, Passion Play is a meaty text for both actors and designers. With eleven parts that travel through Elizabethan England, Hitler's Germany, and post-Vietnam America, the script lends itself to both challenging individual character work and strong ensemble-building.
We believe the best way to learn about theatre is by doing it. This fall, we will produce a challenging piece of theatre with a team comprised completely of students. 
""I don’t know if this country needs more religion or less of it. Seems to me everyone needs a good night’s sleep. That way we’d all wake up for real in the morning. It’s good to be awake. When you’re awake you can fight for what you believe in, no matter what costume you’re wearing.""

the mission

Director's Note:
There are a number of reasons why I love Passion Play. I love the scale of it: three acts, roughly twenty scenes apiece, that span four hundred plus years of history. I love the language—how it’s poetic, poignant, contemporary, clever, and funny all at once. I love that there are rich historical backdrops, but the play isn’t about them; it’s about the people living within them. I love that Ruhl’s focus on the individual makes big ideas about the human condition seem easier to tackle. And I love that this play begs us to think about the pressures we put on ourselves. I find that I—and I think many people pursing the arts—feel constant pressure to live up to something, to amount to something, to work towards something, even when I don’t know what that something is. Where do these desired effects or ideals come from? I’d like to use this play to better understand the pressure that seems to dominate the lives of many of the people I know and love.

<h3><strong>What's all this fuss about??</strong></h3>
<div>This dance-video, depicting the treatment of homosexuals during World War II, is drawing a parallel between concentration camps and how physically constrained one can feel when self–expression is repressed. Dance-wise, the prisoners craving for freedom are symbolized by the organs trying to come out of the rib cage barrier. The dancer portrays growth, escape and rebirth of those incarcerated souls by embodying a gay Aryan during the Nazi era. <br/><br/>“Untermensch” means “under-man” or “sub-human” in German.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This project is a tribute to those who have suffered in prison or concentration camps, due to their sexual orientation, religious beliefs or cultural background. Furthermore, it is for anyone who has ever felt oppressed or ostracized.</div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<h3><strong>Where is all the $$$ going?? And why we need your help!</strong></h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Summer Shakespeare is a series of free Shakespeare-themed events geared towards young people in Accra. The program is performance-based, the point being to give young people a chance to be on stage, and consists of two main events: an acting workshop, and a reading series. The acting workshop will focus on the comedy, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, a piece chosen for its ensemble nature. There is room for about twenty participants, no leads, and the whole group will be responsible for adapting the play to make it more Ghanaian, more “them”, and thus more relevant to their experience of theworkshop and of their lives. This workshop is currently supported by the Nubuke Foundation, and will take place at the Foundation’s premises at East Legon, a suburb of Accra. The reading series will focus on Shakespeare’s nondramatic poetry, meaning the sonnets and excerpts from his minor epic poems. These readings will be hosted at various informal locations throughout the city. Other events, such as film screenings, are also planned.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> The start date for the project is Monday, 18th June, 2012, coinciding opportunely with the 2012 World Shakespeare Festival, a remarkable celebration of “Shakespeare as the world’s playwright” in which 37 plays will be staged in 37 languages by the Royal Shakespeare Company and international collaborators. The acting workshop will continue for six weeks, and will culminate in a performance of A Midsummer Night’s Dream on Friday, July 27th 2012. The reading series is confirmed to happen at least once a week, starting Saturday 23rd June, 2012, for about the same time duration as the acting workshop. Other events, such as film screenings and sample classes for younger children, will occur when opportunity arises during this period.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">It is extremely important that this program is created and kept free, in order to keep it accessible for the general population of youth in Accra. Of course, this means that we need other people to help us pay for necessities like scripts, costumes, props, production costs, and all the other things that come with running a project like this. We also need help getting one of our teaching staff, Nikaury Roman, who is a junior at DePauw University, across the Atlantic so she can help out with the program on the ground.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">All donors will have access to special project updates and will be given a special ""thank you"" in the program for the final showcase. Donations of $100 or more will receive a DVD based on the acting workshop and other cool items such as show posters autographed by the cast of A Midsummer Night's Dream.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
There is a lot of talent in Accra, and not nearly enough platforms. For young people who are interested in the performing arts, particularly theatre, there are very few opportunities to experience the performance process as a professional. This is a unique opportunity to be involved in every aspect of the play making process from start to finish, to take ownership of the most powerful tool we have: language.</div>

This workshop is currently supported by the Nubuke Foundation, and will take place at the Foundation’s premises at East Legon, a suburb of Accra. The reading series will focus on Shakespeare’s nondramatic poetry, meaning the sonnets and excerpts from his minor epic poems. These readings will be hosted at various informal locations throughout the city. Other events, such as film screenings, are also planned.
 The start date for the project is Monday, 18th June, 2012, coinciding opportunely with the 2012 World Shakespeare Festival, a remarkable celebration of “Shakespeare as the world’s playwright” in which 37 plays will be staged in 37 languages by the Royal Shakespeare Company and international collaborators. The acting workshop will continue for six weeks, and will culminate in a performance of A Midsummer Night’s Dream on Friday, July 27th 2012. The reading series is confirmed to happen at least once a week, starting Saturday 23rd June, 2012, for about the same time duration as the acting workshop. Other events, such as film screenings and sample classes for younger children, will occur when opportunity arises during this period.


What We Need & What You Get
It is extremely important that this program is created and kept free, in order to keep it accessible for the general population of youth in Accra. Of course, this means that we need other people to help us pay for necessities like scripts, costumes, props, production costs, and all the other things that come with running a project like this. We also need help getting one of our teaching staff, Nikaury Roman, who is a junior at DePauw University, across the Atlantic so she can help out with the program on the ground.
All donors will have access to special project updates and will be given a special ""thank you"" in the program for the final showcase. Donations of $100 or more will receive a DVD based on the acting workshop and other cool items such as show posters autographed by the cast of A Midsummer Night's Dream.


The Impact
There is a lot of talent in Accra, and not nearly enough platforms. For young people who are interested in the performing arts, particularly theatre, there are very few opportunities to experience the performance process as a professional. This is a unique opportunity to be involved in every aspect of the play making process from start to finish, to take ownership of the most powerful tool we have: language.

</div></div>","100 Proof's Tale
We are staging a new production of Igor Stravinsky's L'Histoire du soldat (or, The Soldier's Tale). Often performed as a concert suite for seven musicians, The Soldier's Tale was originally written ""to be read, played, and danced."" Our production will include reading, playing, dancing and more, as we present a new interpretation of C.F. Ramuz's libretto.Though based on a Russian folk tale, our soldier, Joseph (Niall Powderly), is serving in the Iraq War. Through his story, we are exploring the difficulties soldiers face while readjusting to life at home: the disconnect, the isolation, the search for meaning, the physical toll on the body. Throughout the show, Joseph struggles against a disguised Devil (William Vaughn), who threatens to derail his quest for inner peace. We see Joseph ache for a non-existent past while the present surges forward. Our question for the ages: after war, what happens when you become the enemy?It's Faust, but Not Really...
As a story that has been told and retold in various forms over centuries, it is important to give our production of The Soldier's Tale our own spin. Because our generation has seen a growing awareness of the effects of war, especially posttraumatic stress disorder, we want to bring that element to this work. For our debut performance, we are exploring an issue that remains largely unaddressed in the arts. 100 Proof isn't about making statements, but asking questions, the kind that sting a little in the back of your throat. 
The Bottom Line
If you've ever tried to find an apartment in Manhattan, you know how expensive space is in this city. So here's what we need to make this production happen:One week in Access Theater--$1675
Music Rental and Performance Rights--$970
Insurance for Actors and Musicians--$380
Set, Costumes and Other Costs--$475
Total--$3500


As you can see, we're actually asking for a little less than we actually need. That's because we will also have a couple of fundraiser parties in New York, where you can meet the producers and performers and have a couple of drinks! But anything you can pitch in here helps, so we can make sure most of our major expenses are covered.

fourth year at the College of Wooster in Ohio in the fall. I
spent last fall at The Moscow Art Theater School (MXAT) in Russia. These
months I spent at MXAT were without a doubt some of the best days of my
life. It was the first time that I was given the opportunity to sleep,
eat, and breathe theater. I spent six, sometimes seven days out of the
week in acting class and I felt my heart flutter with joy through every
moment of it. I fell in love with the concentrated curriculum. I also
found renewed confidence when I saw the ease at which I tackled such a
physically and emotionally demanding schedule. It felt like my time spent in
Moscow ended much too quickly. </span></p><p></p><p></p>

This spring, I took a course called Education in a Sociocultural Context. This
course has truly taught me the value of education. Since taking this course I
have seen my dreams grow from ones of personal satisfaction into dreams that
are rooted in service to others. I hope that one day I will be able to use
my skills in theater to educate young people like myself through art and
performance as companies such as The Youth Ensemble of Atlanta has done for
me. </span></p><p></p><p></p>

</div></div>","My Story






 

Hi, my name is Jacqueline Naami Narnor and I will begin my
fourth year at the College of Wooster in Ohio in the fall. I
spent last fall at The Moscow Art Theater School (MXAT) in Russia. These
months I spent at MXAT were without a doubt some of the best days of my
life. It was the first time that I was given the opportunity to sleep,
eat, and breathe theater. I spent six, sometimes seven days out of the
week in acting class and I felt my heart flutter with joy through every
moment of it. I fell in love with the concentrated curriculum. I also
found renewed confidence when I saw the ease at which I tackled such a
physically and emotionally demanding schedule. It felt like my time spent in
Moscow ended much too quickly. 
 
Still, I was glad to return to Wooster and continue my studies.
This spring, I took a course called Education in a Sociocultural Context. This
course has truly taught me the value of education. Since taking this course I
have seen my dreams grow from ones of personal satisfaction into dreams that
are rooted in service to others. I hope that one day I will be able to use
my skills in theater to educate young people like myself through art and
performance as companies such as The Youth Ensemble of Atlanta has done for
me. 

In order to be the best that I can be, I know that I must seek
the best education that I can find and recognize it when I find it - which is
what has led me to the Yale Summer Conservatory for Actors.    I am super excited because this is an AMAZING training program!! At Yale Summer Session, I will be able to work with leading professionals and Yale School of Drama faculty and staff.  The program is immersive and so so beneficial. 

 
You may even know of some people that have trained at Yale - Meryl Streep, Angela Bassett, and Law & Order's Chris Noth, to name a few.


I know that I
am meant for the stage and I want nothing more than to compliment my
talents with precision training.  Only now, I need your help in paying
tuition so that I can take the next step in accomplishing my goals.
 




The Impact



 
I discovered early in
life that I had been blessed with a powerful voice and that power is not
limited to volume and fervor. I discovered that my voice radiates from within
me. I saw that when I spoke, people listened and at first I did not know what
to do with such a gift so I told outlandish stories with great conviction to entertain
myself and anyone else that I could get to listen.
 
At 16 I made one of the
best decisions in my life, I joined the Youth Ensemble of Atlanta
(YEA). At YEA I learned how to funnel my voice down a focused path. I learned
to love my voice and in turn to love ME. It was at YEA that I learned work
ethics, I learned passion, I learned to smile even when it hurts. I began to
develop a passion for education and for theater. 
 
Without opportunities
like the one being offered to me now by Yale Summer Session I will not be able
to offer the best of me to the world. I know that my voice is important and by
training it I will be able to teach other young people, like myself, that their
voices are also.
 
This Summer, I will be giving back some of myself and what
you've already invested in me, by interning - without pay -  for a program
called Higher Achievement Summer School, teaching self-esteem, through theater,
to disadvantaged youth from the Black Belt of Alabama. 

One day I will teach acting and to teach I must become a master at my craft. I will begin this part 
of my journey this summer when I intern -without pay- at Higher Achievement Summer School. While there I will be teaching self-esteem, through theater,
to disadvantaged youth from the Black Belt of Alabama. 

 What We Need &
What You Get
 
The program costs $5, 800. That covers room, board, and tuition
into the program. I have been able to save $1,300 dollars by working
on campus as a resident assistant between January and May.  Therefore,
my campaign goal is $4,500. I will pay for my way to and
from New Haven at the start and end of the program. 
 
Also, I pledge to:
1.    Offer myself as a resource to anyone
who needs my help, advice, or talents.
2.    I will continue to mentor young people
and offer them the best of me selflessly.
3.    I will continue to strive for the
dreams you are all supporting, even when it seems all odds (financially) are
against me.
 
If
I do not raise all of the money needed, I will not be able to attend the
program but dreams do not die because of obstacles. Instead, they are
empowered. If l am unable to reach my goal the money will remain untouched and
will become part of what I will use to pay for graduate school in the fall of
2012. 
 
Other Ways You Can
Help
 
If you can't donate you
can still help me out:
 
1. Pass this link to
EVERY kind person you know and proudly put in a word for me! 
2. Pray, send me positive
energy, good vibes, meditate, whatever it is that you do best.
3. Continue to believe in
me. 
 
Thank you very much indeed!!
I appreciate all of your time, care, support, effort, and love.
 
Stay Blessed,

He will be doing a full production of Empanada for a Dream this summer in Chicago as a co-production with Teatro Vista and Collaberaction. He is also a playwright with plays “el dragon del village”, “gen-tried”, “he will rise” and “don chipotle” being currently being developed. Juan is a proud member of AEA/SAG/AFTRA.

ARTIST BIOS
Juan Francisco Villa* (Playwright/Performer) grew up on the Lower East Side the son of first generation immigrants from Columbia. He is a recovering Catholic after 8 years at Our Lady of Sorrows Elementary, 4 years at the Jesuit All Boys High School La Salle Academy,  and 4 ½ years at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, NY (that’s 8 years of Jesuits).  Like a good native New Yorker, he left town -- for Chicago -- where he honed his skills at Improv Olympic, Second City, The Goodman Theater, Steppenwolf Theater, Lookingglass Theater and American Theater Company. He has had the honor of working with esteemed playwrights Laura Eason and Ifa Bayeza and has acted in El Grito del Bronx by Migdalia Cruz and Massacre or Sing to Your Children by Jose Rivera, both for the Goodman Theatre.  His Chicago Steppenwolf credits include Elliot: A Soldier’s Fugue by Quiara Alegria-Hudes and Take Me Out by Richard Greenberg.  Juan moved back to NYC and graduated from Maggie Flanigan’s Meisner Conservatory.  He has performed Off and Off Off Broadway at Rattlestick, Mabou Mines/SUITE, INTAR, terraNOVA, Rising Circle, Monarch, HERO Theater, Lark Play Development, Collaboration Town, BAX and 59E59. Juan has worked as a Teaching Artist with Manhattan Theater Club, and in Chicago, Pegasus Players, Salsation and Teatro Vista.  Through the Peoples Theater Project, he completed a school year teaching English skills through Acting Shakespeare to Harbor Heights 8th graders in Washington Heights. He has been an ensemble member of SALSATION, Chicago's first Latino Sketch/Improv Group and is a current ensemble member of InViolet Theater Company in NYC and Teatro Vista, Chicago’s largest, non–profit–equity, Latino theater company producing full scale, Latino oriented, theatrical productions in English. He will be doing a full production of Empanada for a Dream this summer in Chicago as a co-production with Teatro Vista and Collaberaction. He is also a playwright with plays “el dragon del village”, “gen-tried”, “he will rise” and “don chipotle” being currently being developed. Juan is a proud member of AEA/SAG/AFTRA. To stay up to date with him you can visit his website juanfranciscovilla.com.
Alex Levy’s work has been seen throughout the United States and around the world. He recently directed Empanada For a Dream in New York for Ballybeg (where he was recently appointed Artistic Director) and again for the soloNOVA Arts Festival.
His production of My Soul is a Witness was featured in the Hindu Metro-Plus International Theatre Festival in Chennai, India and toured several cities throughout India.  Alex twice led international tours through Jordan, Egyot, Turkey and Morocco sponsored by The U.S. State Department.  In 2010, Alex was selected to participate in Dah Theatre’s Internatial Research Center for Actors and Directors in Belgrade, Serbia.
His directing credits include the national tour of America Amerique (World Premiere) for Jena Productions.  In Los Angeles he directed the world premiere of In the Red for the ARK Theatre. Copenhagen and Dead Man’s Cellphone for UCLA.  Also for UCLA, he conceived, adapted and directed Home Front, a one-act play based on interviews with combat veterans in Southern California and A Dark Sun, a full-length ensemble based work based on the writings of Carl Jung.
Before moving to Los Angeles, Alex served as Artistic Director of Pegasus Players in Chicago. While at Pegasus, the theatre won seventeen Joseph Jefferson Citations, seven After Dark Awards.
For Pegasus, he directed several productions including Continental Divide, Golda’s Balcony (Jeff Award for “Outstanding Solo Performance), The Upper Room (Jeff Citation for “Best New Work”),  Black Caesar (Three Black Excellence Nominations), Still Life, Broadway Bound (Jeff nominated for four citations including “Best Production” and winner of the After Dark Award for “Best Ensemble”) and The One-Eyed Man is King as well as nine productions for the Chicago Young Playwrights Festival.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><strong><span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Many Women of Troy</span> </strong>is a postmodern adaptation of 
Euripides’ Greek tragedy - this musical collage of war and suffering 
throughout history is seen through the eyes of five strong women 
wrestling with loss: Cassandra, the bitter prophetess; Andromache, the 
naive mother; Polyxena, the lost child; Hecuba, the vengeful queen; and 
Helen, the face that launched a thousand ships. They journey from 
Ancient Troy to modern times and back again, witnessing the causes and 
ramifications of human anger, ignorance, apathy, and hate. As they 
struggle though immeasurable grief and rail against the horrors of 
violence, they finally come to understand the improbable yet absolutely 
necessary need to rise above and move beyond repeating the mistakes of 
the past.</p>

<p>This groundbreaking work is being presented by the <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pallas Theatre Collective</span>, and we are thrilled to announce that it will be a part of both the Hollywood and Capital Fringe Festivals this coming summer! Check back for dates!<br/></p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I am an <b>Edinburgh based freelance dance artist and teacher/facilitator</b>. I graduated in 2007 from the Northern School of Contemporary Dance in Leeds and have since worked with various choreographers and have developed a successful freelance career.</p>
<p>A few years ago  I suffered a serious hip ligament injury that left me unable to dance. I was told by doctors that I would most likely not be able to dance professionally again. However, I was lucky enough to come across somatic movement (specifically Laban/Bartenieff Fundamentals) and over I time I learned how to cope with my injury and returned to dancing.</p>
<p>I now work full time teaching and dancing. I teach dance classes for adults, primary aged children, young people, mums and babies and dancers with additional support needs in a variety of dance styles all over Edinburgh.</p>

<p><span></span></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What is a somatics-based approach to dance education?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Somatic
practices, such as Laban/Bartenieff Fundamentals, focus on
<b>connecting mind and body</b> through movement and a deep level of <b>self-awareness</b>.
In a dance context these approaches encourage <b>self-acceptance, personal
exploration/understanding </b>and an<b> intelligent way of moving</b> that is more<b>
beneficial for the dancer’s body </b>than traditional training methods. Somatics-based
approaches to dance do this through developing an <b>understanding of how the body
organises, </b>of <b>personal habits </b>and <b>movement patterns</b>. It then provides
<b>opportunities for re-organisation </b>and <b>finding new possibilities</b>;</p>
<p></p>
<p><i><span>“</span></i><i>Instead of striving to perform the ""right” or
“correct” movement, the dancer learns to move from an embodied source – fully
receptive and responsive to the moment of movement. Such training is designed
to free the dancer from rigid holding patterns or other constraints that bind

<ul> </ul> </div> </div>","I have been awarded a bursary for the Bill Evans Dance Teacher Intensive (BETI) and International Conference on Somatics-based Dance Education in Franklin, Massachusetts 6th-18th July 2015. This campaign is to help me cover the accommodation and board costs so that I can attend.
*I have now reached my target thanks to all these wonderful people. Any further contributions exceeding this (still some time left!) will go towards travel costs (internal trains/buses, flights, insurance, visa) and accommodation immediately before and after the event.*

Who am I?
I am an Edinburgh based freelance dance artist and teacher/facilitator. I graduated in 2007 from the Northern School of Contemporary Dance in Leeds and have since worked with various choreographers and have developed a successful freelance career.
A few years ago  I suffered a serious hip ligament injury that left me unable to dance. I was told by doctors that I would most likely not be able to dance professionally again. However, I was lucky enough to come across somatic movement (specifically Laban/Bartenieff Fundamentals) and over I time I learned how to cope with my injury and returned to dancing.
I now work full time teaching and dancing. I teach dance classes for adults, primary aged children, young people, mums and babies and dancers with additional support needs in a variety of dance styles all over Edinburgh.
You can find more information, photos and videos on my website and Facebook page.



What is a somatics-based approach to dance education?

Somatic
practices, such as Laban/Bartenieff Fundamentals, focus on
connecting mind and body through movement and a deep level of self-awareness.
In a dance context these approaches encourage self-acceptance, personal
exploration/understanding and an intelligent way of moving that is more
beneficial for the dancer’s body than traditional training methods. Somatics-based
approaches to dance do this through developing an understanding of how the body
organises, of personal habits and movement patterns. It then provides
opportunities for re-organisation and finding new possibilities;

“Instead of striving to perform the ""right” or
“correct” movement, the dancer learns to move from an embodied source – fully
receptive and responsive to the moment of movement. Such training is designed
to free the dancer from rigid holding patterns or other constraints that bind
thought, feeling, and action. More time is given to opening a space for pausing
and reflecting.” (Glenna Batson, ‘Somatic Studies and
Dance’, 2009, http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.iadms.org/resource/resmgr/resource_papers/somatic_studies.pdf). 

Why is this important?
My experience with injury is a fantastic example of how important this work is and can be. I am so grateful that I am able to continue dancing and really believe that this approach can help others. By attending the BETI and conference, I will gain more knowledge of somatic approaches and learn various ways of incorporating them into my teaching and creative practice so that I can help others with injuries and also help to prevent them.

<h3>Why is G.L.O.R.Y. important?</h3> <p>Many of us are self-admitted wrestling nerds and are former/current wrestlers in various organizations including other female leagues.

<p>We've also seen some of the best things: unbridled, joyful entertainment, the thrill of performance, the raw power of the slam, the energy from the crowd, and absurdly brilliant storylines.</p>
<p>We strive to be a safe space, free from harassment, a place where people can be their best selves in and out of the ring. </p>
<p>G.L.O.R.Y. is modeled after many other successful leagues that have emerged in recent years, whose numbers are only growing. We want to be pioneers on the forefront of this new chapter in wrestling history and positive role models in the community.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback thus far, but in our effort to include those who have perhaps been turned off by wrestling in the past due to some of the issues listed above, we may lose some of the more traditional fans associated with wrestling.

<p>In our mission to include all types of women in performance and logistical positions in G.L.O.R.Y., we aren't able to include self-identified males on our roster. Our ultimate goal is to be a production 100% staffed by self-identified women and non-binary folks.

<p>Can you be another person's fate? The year is 1953. Two strangers meet at
midnight in a run down empty bar. Max has left the war, and Joy has left her husband. Their
night together has all the makings of a classic boy-meets-girl love story. But Max has a secret up his
sleeve—a shocking revelation that unearths a painful history they may not be able to endure. Now, before the sun comes up, these two unlikely soul mates will struggle to find hope in the face of unthinkable grief. Inspired by true events, <i>The Second Sun</i> is an uncommon love story of endurance and survival.</p>

<p>This project means a great deal to me. I have been in a lot of plays, and I've never experienced such a moving, humbling response from an audience. Months and months after a workshop, people are still telling me how much the play affected them, and something personal from their lives that it illuminated.</p>
<p>In this world of ever-deepening mistrust and tumult, I think it is incredibly important to tell stories of hope, and family, and endurance--and a chance of getting through the darkness to the light.</p>

</div><br/></div>","Can you be another person's fate? The year is 1953. Two strangers meet at
midnight in a run down empty bar. Max has left the war, and Joy has left her husband. Their
night together has all the makings of a classic boy-meets-girl love story. But Max has a secret up his
sleeve—a shocking revelation that unearths a painful history they may not be able to endure. Now, before the sun comes up, these two unlikely soul mates will struggle to find hope in the face of unthinkable grief. Inspired by true events, The Second Sun is an uncommon love story of endurance and survival.
To purchase tickets to The Second Sun, visit this link: http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/1701828
Over the past year, The Second Sun, has enjoyed a number of very successful workshops. 
Now, we have been accepted into the Thespis Theater Festival and will be playing at the Hudson Guild Theater on September the 8th at 6:15, the 12th at 8:30, and the 13th at 1:00.
This project means a great deal to me. I have been in a lot of plays, and I've never experienced such a moving, humbling response from an audience. Months and months after a workshop, people are still telling me how much the play affected them, and something personal from their lives that it illuminated.
In this world of ever-deepening mistrust and tumult, I think it is incredibly important to tell stories of hope, and family, and endurance--and a chance of getting through the darkness to the light.

Your contributions will help us compensate the actors, the director, and the stage-manager, as well as to afford our rehearsal space, marketing, technical support, costumes, props, and publicity.
 
We really believe in this production, and we aim to give it a longer run Off-Broadway in the near future, so to that end, there is no contribution too large.
But there is also no contribution too small. We would be so thankful for you to support this project in any way you can.

This is a story about people fighting for love, fighting for joy, and fighting to stay alive. 
We would love you to be a part of it!
Thank you for supporting The Second Sun.

<p>Last November I created a show titled “Why I Shakespeare” in which, through my own words and Shakespeare's I gave voice to some of the reasons I feel compelled to develop my skills as an actor, teacher, and coach around the works of William Shakespeare. I wanted to share some of these words with you in hopes of articulating my intentions as I move forward in my training:</p>
<p>I Shakespeare because he lets me know that it’s okay to not think before I speak but simply speak what I feel.</p>
<p>I Shakespeare because he takes his pain &amp; joy and the pain &amp; joy of his community and my pain &amp; joy and the pain &amp; joy of my community and brings us all together. </p>
<p>I Shakespeare because he gives me the tools to spot when a good argument is covering an unworthy cause in hopes of helping those with a worthy cause make a better argument.</p>
<p>I Shakespeare because he shows me that immortality is possible in the stories we live and leave behind.</p>
<p>I Shakespeare because no matter the limits he pushes me to he always ends up teaching me more about the simplicity of self.</p>
<p>I Shakespeare because everyone at some point is going to have something to say. And you’re going to find yourself standing in from of a crowd of people or maybe just one person. And Shakespeare can help you be bold and truthful, to connect with others, and share your most compelling self.</p>
<p>I want to save the world, but I don’t have superpowers.  What I do have, is Shakespeare.  The works of William Shakespeare explore the full spectrum of the human experience, allowing me, as an actor, to connect on an intimate level with my audience.  The actor and audience relationship is the most important part of the theatrical experience for me, as it invites potential for connection and understanding, both of oneself, and of the world we live in.</p>
<p>As an actor himself, writing for other actors, Shakespeare empowers the actor more than any other playwright, which is why I have devoted my career to studying and performing his work. He expects his actors to be in direct connection with the audience, and demands a huge imagination and well trained instrument, so they can tell truths, and affect change in the world. I have been changed by Shakespeare’s language. It has validated my own thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and has given me the idea that they are universal—that my personal experience is a part of the larger human experience. Shakespeare’s plays link me directly to humanity as a whole, and if more people can have an experience of discovering that their personal stories may be shared, as well, they will have a different relationship with the world, and it will begin to change.</p><div><span style=""line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;""><p></p>

About Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim
Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim lived at the turn of the sixteenth century and among many other things, was a genuine polymath, an academic scholar who argued that the misogynistic ordering of society that places men over women was a social condition, and not a pre-ordained given. Through an academic lecture given at Dole, Agrippa used scripture to demonstrate this, attracting what turned into bitter opposition from the mendicant orders within the Church, in particular the Dominicans. The consequence of this was the portrayal of Agrippa as a ‘black magician’ who among other things was said to summon demons at will. This reputation would persist long after Agrippa’s death, even as a posthumous reference in Marlowe’s ‘Doctor Faustus’:
…Will be as cunning as Agrippa was
Whose shadow made all Europe honor him. (1.1.104-111)
The reality was that Agrippa studied and wrote about what was then called ‘natural magic’. Today this would amount to knowledge of aromatherapy, herbal supplements and essential oils. At different times he was an attendant to the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian The First, acted as agent for the same in Paris, and would through military service come to be knighted.

<h3>Tombstone: About the show</h3>
<p><i>Tombstone</i> is a live action puppet show that mashes the genres of science fiction and westerns and blends the worlds of puppetry and film. While the performers scramble to keep up with the onstage action the science fiction western B movie they are creating seamlessly unfolds on the screen above their heads. Watch a <a href=""https://vimeo.com/64282394"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">trailer for our last production</a>, created in the same style. </p>
<p>All of the puppets and set are constructed from cardboard, hot glue, magnets and things normal people might throw in the trash. But the simplicity of the materials is contrasted by the complexity of emotions explored through the main character Petal's identity crisis.</p>

that so often surrounds classical theatre, instead, making it fun and accessible. We
present simple clean shows and host rocking post show receptions where the
audience can mingle with cast, talk about the Shakespeare, and have a blast. We’ve
found a receptive audience here in NYC. In our first two years, we produced two
staged readings, two one-night revues, our first summer mainstage production <i>As You Like It</i>, and launched our
educational workshop series <i>Working Classics</i>. <br/></p>

<p>Embracing this concept of “simple

Le chorégraphe Sylvain Émard explore le territoire de la nature humaine à

enviable sur la scène de la danse contemporaine tant nationale
qu’internationale. Sensible au métissage des genres, Sylvain Émard navigue avec
aisance dans diverses sphères artistiques, tel qu’en témoigne sa collaboration
sur l’opéra <i>1984</i> de Lorin Maazel,
mise en scène par Robert Lepage et présentée, notamment sur les célèbres planches
du Covent Garden à Londres (2005) et de La Scala de Milan (2008).</p>
<p>Reconnu pour le

au Festival TransAmériques (FTA) 2009. Passant d’une distribution de 65
danseurs amateurs en 2009 à plus de 200 interprètes non professionnels en 2011,
cette oeuvre hybride à la croisée de la danse en ligne et de la danse
contemporaine a suscité l’adhésion générale pour trois années consécutives au
FTA. Ce vent de fraîcheur souffle bien au-delà de la métropole. New York,
Philadelphie, Portland (Oregon), Mexico, Ottawa, Boston, Vancouver et Ansan (Corée du Sud) ont été
renversés par cette vague continentalienne. À ce jour, <b>Le Grand Continental</b> a fait bouger plus de 1000 danseurs amateurs à
travers le monde et séduit au-delà de 80 000 spectateurs!</p>
<p><b>D'un Continental à l'autre</b></p>
<p>Porté par le succès de
ses précédentes éditions, Sylvain Émard Danse prépare une quatrième
soirée-bénéfice sous le sceau du <b>Grand
Continental</b>, baptisé <b>D’un
Continental à l’autre</b>. Ce spectacle-anniversaire mixera les différentes
moutures du célèbre concept qui fait vibrer les continents des deux côtés du
Pacifique, depuis 2009. Quarante personnalités provenant des mondes culturel et
des affaires livreront une performance électrisante. Vingt minutes swingnantes!</p>
<p><b>Un solo participatif</b></p>
<p>En grande primeur
montréalaise, Sylvain Émard ouvrira le bal en offrant un solo bien spécial. Un
solo créé à partir de vos idées! Vous êtes donc invités à lui proposer des
mouvements qui inspireront la création de ce solo. Une occasion unique de
participer au processus de création et de voir danser le chorégraphe.<br/>
<br/>
L’événement-bénéfice 25e anniversaire/<b>D’un
Continental à l’autre</b> de Sylvain Émard Danse se tiendra à Circuit-Est

</p><p><i>Sylvain Émard Danse is celebrating its 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary this
year, 25 years of passionate commitment to creating new works, to producing and
presenting extraordinary dance. The company now counts more than 30 pieces in
its repertoire, works rich in fluid, energetic, sensual movement. The choreographer
Sylvain Émard explores the territory of human nature through the power of the
body. Over the years he has established a privileged position on the contemporary
dance scene nationally and internationally. Eager to mingle genres, Sylvain
Émard moves freely through diverse artistic spheres, as can be seen in his
collaboration on the Lorin Maazel opera 1984,
directed by Robert Lepage and namely presented on the celebrated stages of
Covent Garden in London (2005) and La Scala in Milan (2008).</i></p><i>
</i><p><i>Renowned for the refinement and precision of his dance vocabulary, Sylvain
Émard surprised many when he presented <b>Le
Grand Continental</b> at the Festival TransAmériques (FTA) in 2009. Shifting
from a cast of 65 amateur dancers in 2009 to more than 200 non-professional
performers in 2011, this hybrid piece that combines line dancing with contemporary
dance was enthusiastically received for three years in a row at the FTA. And that
breath of fresh air blew far beyond Montreal, with performances in New York,
Philadelphia, Portland (Oregon), Mexico City, Ottawa, Boston, Vancouver and Ansan
(South Korea) all swept away by the Continental wave. To date, <b>Le Grand Continental</b> has featured over
1000 amateur dancers around the world and delighted more than 80,000 spectators!</i></p><i>
</i><p><i><b>From One Continental to
Another</b></i></p><i>
</i><p><i>Driven by the success of the previous editions, Sylvain Émard Danse is preparing
a fourth benefit evening under the <b>Grand
Continental</b> banner entitled <b>D’un
Continental à l’autre</b>. This anniversary presentation will blend the different
versions of the now famous concept that since 2009 has thrilled audiences in
continents on both sides of the Pacific. Forty personalities from the cultural
and business communities will take part in an electrifying performance. Get
ready for 20 hot swinging minutes!</i></p><i>
</i><p><i><b>A Shared Solo<span>  </span></b></i></p><i>
</i><p><i>In a grand Montreal première, Sylvain Émard will get things underway by presenting
a very special solo, a piece concocted from your suggestions! You are invited

to participate in the creative process and also to see the choreographer
perform the solo.<br/></i>

D'un Continental à l'autre
Porté par le succès de
ses précédentes éditions, Sylvain Émard Danse prépare une quatrième
soirée-bénéfice sous le sceau du Grand
Continental, baptisé D’un
Continental à l’autre. Ce spectacle-anniversaire mixera les différentes
moutures du célèbre concept qui fait vibrer les continents des deux côtés du
Pacifique, depuis 2009. Quarante personnalités provenant des mondes culturel et
des affaires livreront une performance électrisante. Vingt minutes swingnantes!
Un solo participatif
En grande primeur
montréalaise, Sylvain Émard ouvrira le bal en offrant un solo bien spécial. Un
solo créé à partir de vos idées! Vous êtes donc invités à lui proposer des
mouvements qui inspireront la création de ce solo. Une occasion unique de
participer au processus de création et de voir danser le chorégraphe.

L’événement-bénéfice 25e anniversaire/D’un
Continental à l’autre de Sylvain Émard Danse se tiendra à Circuit-Est
centre chorégraphique, situé au 2022, rue Sherbrooke Est, le 2 novembre à 20 h. Un cocktail-dessert suivra
la représentation.

Les fonds recueillis lors de cette campagne de
financement permettront à la compagnie de poursuivre sa mission de création, de
production et de diffusion tant sur les scènes nationales qu’internationales. ***
Sylvain Émard Danse is celebrating its 25th anniversary this
year, 25 years of passionate commitment to creating new works, to producing and
presenting extraordinary dance. The company now counts more than 30 pieces in
its repertoire, works rich in fluid, energetic, sensual movement. The choreographer
Sylvain Émard explores the territory of human nature through the power of the
body. Over the years he has established a privileged position on the contemporary
dance scene nationally and internationally. Eager to mingle genres, Sylvain
Émard moves freely through diverse artistic spheres, as can be seen in his
collaboration on the Lorin Maazel opera 1984,
directed by Robert Lepage and namely presented on the celebrated stages of
Covent Garden in London (2005) and La Scala in Milan (2008).
Renowned for the refinement and precision of his dance vocabulary, Sylvain
Émard surprised many when he presented Le
Grand Continental at the Festival TransAmériques (FTA) in 2009. Shifting
from a cast of 65 amateur dancers in 2009 to more than 200 non-professional
performers in 2011, this hybrid piece that combines line dancing with contemporary
dance was enthusiastically received for three years in a row at the FTA. And that
breath of fresh air blew far beyond Montreal, with performances in New York,
Philadelphia, Portland (Oregon), Mexico City, Ottawa, Boston, Vancouver and Ansan
(South Korea) all swept away by the Continental wave. To date, Le Grand Continental has featured over
1000 amateur dancers around the world and delighted more than 80,000 spectators!
From One Continental to
Another
Driven by the success of the previous editions, Sylvain Émard Danse is preparing
a fourth benefit evening under the Grand
Continental banner entitled D’un
Continental à l’autre. This anniversary presentation will blend the different
versions of the now famous concept that since 2009 has thrilled audiences in
continents on both sides of the Pacific. Forty personalities from the cultural
and business communities will take part in an electrifying performance. Get
ready for 20 hot swinging minutes!
A Shared Solo  
In a grand Montreal première, Sylvain Émard will get things underway by presenting
a very special solo, a piece concocted from your suggestions! You are invited
to propose movements that will inspire its creation. This is a unique opportunity
to participate in the creative process and also to see the choreographer
perform the solo.

The 25th anniversary event D’un
Continental à l’autre organized by Sylvain Émard Danse will take place at
the Circuit-Est centre chorégraphique, located at 2022 Sherbrooke St. East on November 2 at 8 p.m. A cocktails-and-dessert
reception will follow the performance.

<h3>Campaign Summary</h3>
<p>TheatreMcLean is the high school theatre program at McLean High School. This award winning after school program is comprised of over 150 passionate students. Our mission is to create thoughtful works of art on story at a time. TheatreMclean has produced plays, musicals, and one acts that reach out to the community.</p>
<p>Our next show 9 to 5 is our most exciting show to date. The musical, based on the movie, is the perfect show to put on stage in this moment of history with its message of true female empowerment. We have the most students ever working on a musical, and with your help, we can make this musical one you’ll never forget.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign is to help with our rigging system which will enable our actors to fly. A system like this is hard to come by, which is why many high schools forgo moments like these. We don’t want to be like most high schools, though. With your contribution we will be able to achieve theatre magic and let our students soar.</p>
<p>You'll receive some one-of-a-kind perks when you support us today--including photos with our leading ladies, a TheatreMcLean season subscription, and a backstage tour to see the rigging system in action!</p>
<p>$3,000 is an ambitious goal, but with the help of our biggest fans (like YOU), we hope we can reach this funding level in the next 28 days. If we do not reach the goal, all funds raised will still be applied to the cost of the rigging system and training for student technicians and actors.</p>
<p>***TheatreMcLean Boosters are a 501(c)3 nonprofit. All donations are tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.***</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A rigging system is a very big deal for a high school theatre program. There are only a few companies in the United States that work with high schools, and Flying by Foy is one of the best in the business. With your contribution, TheatreMclean’s production of 9 to 5 will be taken to the next level. Never before in Mclean High School’s history has someone flown through the air. With your contribution you can be a part of something brand new. We are proud to put on award winning work, and this fly system would greatly help our production. The impact this fly system will have on the show is tremendous, during intermission, that’s what we want the audience to be talking about. Help us make that happen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Making someone fly is not an easy task. There are numerous safety hurdles and finding the right fly company is often difficult. This is why many schools don’t fly their actors because they are afraid something might go wrong, or they don’t have the funds to get the best system possible.</p>
<p>TheatreMclean, however, isn’t afraid of the risks. We often choose the risky path because our students are hungry to be better performers. We wouldn’t have decided to fly someone if we thought our student’s weren’t ready. They are responsible enough to take on the challenge. We studied and researched the best fly company, and thanks to our many successful shows we are close to being able to purchase them. That’s where you come in. Something this gargantuan isn’t cheap, and while we are a successful after school program, it isn’t enough. For something this important, TheatreMcLean needs the best in safety and product. Flying by Foy is that company. With your contribution we will be able to secure them and succeed in our endeavor.</p>
</div><div>

<div>
<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p>HI! We're Greencard Wedding, a theatrical two person indie folk-beatbox-rock band. We're both actors and musicians who write music and plays. We met in a church on a rainy night, in Crown Heights Brooklyn, and the rest is history in the making. We moved in together for almost two years, in order to make theater and music 24/7. . . till Michael's visa ran out and he had to move back to Amsterdam. </p>
<p>But we are not easily discouraged. Like starcrossed creative soul mates, we decided we had to find a way to beat the international distance and keep working and touring together. So we wrote a Skype show (based on transcriptions of our calls) with music, video and a guest appearance by one of our favorite actors: David Anzuelo. The show relys heavily on live Skyping onstage so it will be possible to perform even we are apart.<strong> But right now, this is the one time we really need to be together in the same place during this process.</strong> We've been offered a chance to reunite in order to have an intensive workshop with a director, producer and video designer and present the work in progress in New York this May. After the workshop, the show will be polished, tech'd, ready to be presented in the NY Fringe Festival 2013.</p>
<p>We just need a teeny tiny bit of help to finish funding the workshop.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED</h3>
<p>Just a tiny bit! This is a super bare bones multi-media show. We've always found ways to make a lot of the techincal requirements ourselves and it all has a very indie bohemian DITY feel. The film footage was shot by our audience. The videos were edited by Jody. The website was built by Jody and translated by Michael. The props are all things that have been made by us for our shows- we even bake our own Frisian wedding cake!</p>
<p>The only things we can't make are aeroplanes (that cross the ocean) and money to pay our team (though we have squirrled away half of it from our previous DC tour and gigs! Thanks NASA and Dixon Place, Parkside Lounge and more!) </p>
<p> Check out more details and photos of our gigs at <a href=""http://www.greencardwedding.com-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.greencardwedding.com-</a> it speaks Dutch and English!</p>
<div> </div>
<p>Here's what your donations will do to help us meet our small goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure  a plane ticket- we've got a sweet deal going on with an airline but we do need $300 to finish covering the costs of bringing Michael to America to workshop the play for a week in May.</li>
<li>Afford modest stipends for our creative team: director Pirronne Yousefzadeh, producer Aaron Simms, video designer TBA, an additional actor (<strong>David Anzuelo!</strong>), to be able to focus their time and attention on the project for the intense week.</li>
<li>Secure Rehearsal Space: we need space that allows us to Skype (that means two rooms) as well as project Skype and video.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Any money raised beyond our goal will go towards funding future productions of THE SKYPE SHOW! (Which really costs next to nothing to present and mount!)</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>WHY YOU ARE AWESOME AND WHAT YOU GET FOR BEING AWESOME</h3>
<p>Well, you've read this far already so that means you've given our story your time and we appreciate it greatly. By helping us get through this stage of the project you will have helped us to take a giant leap towards a sustainable way of working together long term as well as devloping a new innovative use for Skype in performance. We also hope that this show may help to begin making a case for Michael's artist Visa.</p>

We met in a church on a rainy night, in Crown Heights Brooklyn, and the rest is history in the making. We moved in together for almost two years, in order to make theater and music 24/7. . . till Michael's visa ran out and he had to move back to Amsterdam. 
But we are not easily discouraged. Like starcrossed creative soul mates, we decided we had to find a way to beat the international distance and keep working and touring together. So we wrote a Skype show (based on transcriptions of our calls) with music, video and a guest appearance by one of our favorite actors: David Anzuelo. The show relys heavily on live Skyping onstage so it will be possible to perform even we are apart. But right now, this is the one time we really need to be together in the same place during this process. We've been offered a chance to reunite in order to have an intensive workshop with a director, producer and video designer and present the work in progress in New York this May. After the workshop, the show will be polished, tech'd, ready to be presented in the NY Fringe Festival 2013.
We just need a teeny tiny bit of help to finish funding the workshop.
 
WHAT WE NEED
Just a tiny bit! This is a super bare bones multi-media show. We've always found ways to make a lot of the techincal requirements ourselves and it all has a very indie bohemian DITY feel. The film footage was shot by our audience. The videos were edited by Jody. The website was built by Jody and translated by Michael. The props are all things that have been made by us for our shows- we even bake our own Frisian wedding cake!
The only things we can't make are aeroplanes (that cross the ocean) and money to pay our team (though we have squirrled away half of it from our previous DC tour and gigs! Thanks NASA and Dixon Place, Parkside Lounge and more!) 
 Check out more details and photos of our gigs at www.greencardwedding.com- it speaks Dutch and English!
 
Here's what your donations will do to help us meet our small goal:

Secure  a plane ticket- we've got a sweet deal going on with an airline but we do need $300 to finish covering the costs of bringing Michael to America to workshop the play for a week in May.
Afford modest stipends for our creative team: director Pirronne Yousefzadeh, producer Aaron Simms, video designer TBA, an additional actor (David Anzuelo!), to be able to focus their time and attention on the project for the intense week.
Secure Rehearsal Space: we need space that allows us to Skype (that means two rooms) as well as project Skype and video.

 
Any money raised beyond our goal will go towards funding future productions of THE SKYPE SHOW! (Which really costs next to nothing to present and mount!)
 
WHY YOU ARE AWESOME AND WHAT YOU GET FOR BEING AWESOME
Well, you've read this far already so that means you've given our story your time and we appreciate it greatly. By helping us get through this stage of the project you will have helped us to take a giant leap towards a sustainable way of working together long term as well as devloping a new innovative use for Skype in performance. We also hope that this show may help to begin making a case for Michael's artist Visa.
 
When you donate we want to give you great stuff. Here's what we came up with:
$1-$24 a thank you in the program and free download of a professional recording of our most popular song (which is featured in the show) ""Stargazer's Lullaby"": http://www.reverbnation.com/greencardweddingband/song/14473771-stargazers-lullaby

<p>Now in its second year, PortFringe is an open-access, non-juried theater festival in which participants are chosen by a random lottery. There are no production fees for participants and 100% of ticket sales are returned to the performance artist or company.</p>

What is PortFringe?PortFringe is a week-long “fringe” theater festival in Portland’s downtown arts district that supports theater and performance artists, encourages artistic innovation, and provides an accessible, affordable outlet for exciting work that enriches Maine's creative community.

<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></i></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
</span></p><p>Raving Mask is a theatre company that focuses on theatre
of the absurd and new writing. It has enjoyed a meteoric rise since being founded
in 2013, receiving widespread admiration and a clutch of awards. Productions of
Samuel Beckett’s Waiting For Godot and
Willy Russell’s Educating Rita in 2014
received extensive acclaim and five star reviews. At the Edinburgh Fringe 2014,
their production of The Noctambulist,
an original piece of writing, received sell-out audiences at Paradise in the
Vault and a five-star review from Broadway Baby.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></i></p>
<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ozymandias,</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> is
a piece of original writing from Company Director and Performer Hugh Train. The
play was first staged at the 2015 Durham Drama Festival where it won the award
for ‘Best Play’ and was then selected to be performed at the North East Drama
Festival in Newcastle in May 2015, at which it received a phenomenal reception.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
<i>Ozymandias</i> is
a comic, one-man, absurdist piece, during which the audience meets and
interacts with an interpretation of the titular character of Percy Shelley’s
poem ‘Ozymandias’. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Prepare to be transported to a surreal world of
rudimentary biology lessons, Egyptian trivia, existential angst, 12A levels of
nudity and The Bangles. As Ramesses the Great (Ozymandias to his friends), invites
all passing travellers to an unsurpassable evening of wit, charm, profundity,
music, storytelling and career advice. </span></p>

<div>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></p>
<p>We hope to raise enough money to cover some of the production costs. As a student theatre company we have limited sources from which to acquire capital to fund this project. We would like to minimise the financial risk for members of the Raving  Mask team.  Your generous financial support  will go towards the following:</p>
<div>
<p>-Venue hire</p>
<p>-Marketing and PR</p>
<p>-Show budget (set, costumes, props etc)</p>
<p>-Renumeration of the production team</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHAT YOU GET</b></p>
<p>We're incredibly grateful for all of your help in getting <i>Ozymandias </i> to the Fringe. And so, to say thank you, we are offering a selection of goodies in return for your kind donations:</p>

</div></div>","Durham based student theatre company Raving
Mask returns to the Edinburgh Fringe with their latest production: Ozymandias.


Raving Mask is a theatre company that focuses on theatre
of the absurd and new writing. It has enjoyed a meteoric rise since being founded
in 2013, receiving widespread admiration and a clutch of awards. Productions of
Samuel Beckett’s Waiting For Godot and
Willy Russell’s Educating Rita in 2014
received extensive acclaim and five star reviews. At the Edinburgh Fringe 2014,
their production of The Noctambulist,
an original piece of writing, received sell-out audiences at Paradise in the
Vault and a five-star review from Broadway Baby.


Ozymandias, is
a piece of original writing from Company Director and Performer Hugh Train. The
play was first staged at the 2015 Durham Drama Festival where it won the award
for ‘Best Play’ and was then selected to be performed at the North East Drama
Festival in Newcastle in May 2015, at which it received a phenomenal reception.


Ozymandias is
a comic, one-man, absurdist piece, during which the audience meets and
interacts with an interpretation of the titular character of Percy Shelley’s
poem ‘Ozymandias’. Prepare to be transported to a surreal world of
rudimentary biology lessons, Egyptian trivia, existential angst, 12A levels of
nudity and The Bangles. As Ramesses the Great (Ozymandias to his friends), invites
all passing travellers to an unsurpassable evening of wit, charm, profundity,
music, storytelling and career advice. 



WHAT WE NEED
We hope to raise enough money to cover some of the production costs. As a student theatre company we have limited sources from which to acquire capital to fund this project. We would like to minimise the financial risk for members of the Raving  Mask team.  Your generous financial support  will go towards the following:

-Venue hire
-Marketing and PR
-Show budget (set, costumes, props etc)
-Renumeration of the production team

WHAT YOU GET
We're incredibly grateful for all of your help in getting Ozymandias  to the Fringe. And so, to say thank you, we are offering a selection of goodies in return for your kind donations:
- Personal thanks across social media


- Posters signed by cast
- A signed photo from Ozymandias
- Personal thanks on the programme and across social media
- Large donations will receive all of the above along with a gift basket containing a selection of items including a signed copy of The Bangles 'Walk Like an Egyptian' and a Toy dust mite.

<p>'Rebel Angel' is a theatrical play giving you the insight into John Keats' early life.

<p>Previously heard on BBC Radio 4, director/writer Angus Graham-Campbell takes his viewers on a journey of John Keats and his pursuit of self-discovery.</p>
<p>Our Indiegogo project, 'Rebel Angel', calls upon audiences across the globe to take part in our mission of launching our 3 week run at The Old Operating Theatre Museum in London. The museum is now fully accessible, reopening their doors this Autumn after being closed for refurbishment to put in a new lift.</p>

<p>This Indiegogo campaign is a first step towards our ambitious dream of creating more opportunities for emerging artists.            </p>
<p>The play explores the circumstances that led the young John Keats to abandon a promising career in medicine and surgery to become one of the most loved and acclaimed of English poets.</p>
<p>Perfect for everyone from English Romantics, literature fanatics, children, adults to your local poetry club. Rebel Angel takes its viewers on a journey of John Keats and his pursuit of self-discovery!</p>

<p>Hello! We are <strong>The Outbound Project!</strong> </p>
<p><br/>We're an <i><strong>Award Winning Physical Theatre Company </strong>with an aim to create</i> exciting, visually dynamic theatre that explores the human condition<br/><strong>'12 Million Volts' </strong></p>
<p><br/><i>Close your eyes. Now, imagine a man…</i></p>
<p><br/><i>Actually – don’t! Let The Outbound Project imagine him for you using award winning visual and physical theatre and storytelling. The company bring the story of Nikola Tesla to life in a dynamic performance using holograms, pigeons with lasers coming out of their eyes, and lighting wizardry.<br/>We are asking you to support our new show and help us bring our vision to life! </i></p>
<p><strong>'12 Million Volts'</strong> is a co-production with <strong>Marine Theatre</strong> in the heart of Lyme Regis as part of their R&amp;D by the Sea programme. Our collaboration has ensured that <strong>'12 Million Volts'</strong> has a platform to reach a wider audience and has given us the opportunity to begin our initial devising process. <br/><a href=""http://www.marinetheatre.com/12-million-volts-wednesday-21%E2%80%A6/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.marinetheatre.com/12-million-volts-w...</a></p>
<p><br/>We have also been programmed at two London venues; <strong>New Diorama Theatre</strong> and <strong>The Space</strong> and are so excited to share our production in these three exceptional venues.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, we need your help to help get us there and create the most visually exciting and engaging theatre we know we are capable of doing. There are some essential costs which need covering to make this project a reality. With your support we will be able to raise the <strong>£1,500</strong> needed to finish the show. <br/>Here is a breakdown of the costs:</p>
<p><strong>£ Set, Props, and Costume</strong> – Our style of theatre is heavily dependent on the actors using lights on stage rather than completely relying on a conventional lighting rig. To do this we need to buy lights and batteries; a lot of batteries. To go along with this to make the best possible show we need costumes that will be made our designer and that will help with our storytelling on stage. </p>
<p><br/><strong>£ Accommodation</strong> - We have secured accommodation at a great price using home stays which are the cheapest form of accommodation in the Lyme Regis Area.</p>
<p><br/><strong>£ Marketing costs</strong> – All shows require some level of marketing and we want to make an extra push to help promote the show to as large an audience as possible both in Lyme Regis and in London. We are receiving some marketing support from the venues we are performing at but would want to extend our marketing beyond our organic reach.</p>
<p><br/><strong>£ Travel</strong> - To get the company of five (4 actors and 1 director) as well as the props for the show to all the venues. We have a car that has been transporting us to and from Lyme Regis. Which has saved us on travel costs already. But with this initial saving we need to be able to afford insurance and petrol.</p>
<p><br/><strong>£ - Contingency</strong> - It is ALWAYS important to have contingency in case anything goes wrong. If we need extra marketing materials, emergency travel, broken props or hidden costs, this would cover it all.</p>
<p><br/>Without your support we will not be able to make the a show that meets our high standards that we hold for ourselves as a company. Your help is very important to us and we have got some wonderful rewards to offer you for your generous contributions.</p>
<p><br/>If you would like to see the show it debuts June 21st and 22nd at <strong>Marine Theatre</strong> in <strong>Lyme Regis</strong>. Followed quickly by a two-night stand at <strong>New Diorama Theatre</strong> in <strong>London</strong> on June 24th and 25th. We will also be performing the show at <strong>The Space</strong> in <strong>London</strong> on August 1st-5th.</p>
<p><strong>Marine Theatre, Lyme Regis, 21st-22nd June<br/>New Diorama, London, 23-24th June<br/>The Space, London, 1st-5th August</strong></p>
<p>Any amount you can donate will get us one step closer to creating a show that will be inspiring and breathtaking for our audiences. We will be incredibly grateful for anything you can give! Thank you for taking the time to look at our page, please share it if you can and we hope to see you at a showing of <strong>“12 Million Volts”</strong>.</p>
<p><u><strong>Risks and challenges </strong></u></p>
<p>Creating theatre as an independent theatre company always has its own range of risks. However, we have already managed to reduce many of these thanks to the support we have received from various arts organisations. With '12 Million Volts' being co-produced by the <strong>Marine Theatre</strong> we are immediately engaged with the local theatre communities and through our advertising will be able to reach out further. In London our relationship with <strong>New Diorama Theatre</strong> has created a net of support that will help the show during its time there. <strong>The Outbound Project</strong> has already developed a strong reputation from its previous show <i><strong>The Mission</strong></i> which created a following for the company. We have already secured accommodation at an affordable rate and we have a strict budget to ensure every penny we raise is spent wisely. Support from the <strong>Marine Theatre</strong> will ensure its debut will not disappointing to our new audience, along with mentorship from <strong>New Diorama</strong> we are able to excite our current London base.</p>
</div></div>","Hello! We are The Outbound Project! 
We're an Award Winning Physical Theatre Company with an aim to create exciting, visually dynamic theatre that explores the human condition'12 Million Volts' 
Close your eyes. Now, imagine a man…
Actually – don’t! Let The Outbound Project imagine him for you using award winning visual and physical theatre and storytelling. The company bring the story of Nikola Tesla to life in a dynamic performance using holograms, pigeons with lasers coming out of their eyes, and lighting wizardry.We are asking you to support our new show and help us bring our vision to life! 
'12 Million Volts' is a co-production with Marine Theatre in the heart of Lyme Regis as part of their R&D by the Sea programme. Our collaboration has ensured that '12 Million Volts' has a platform to reach a wider audience and has given us the opportunity to begin our initial devising process. http://www.marinetheatre.com/12-million-volts-w...
We have also been programmed at two London venues; New Diorama Theatre and The Space and are so excited to share our production in these three exceptional venues.
 
However, we need your help to help get us there and create the most visually exciting and engaging theatre we know we are capable of doing. There are some essential costs which need covering to make this project a reality. With your support we will be able to raise the £1,500 needed to finish the show. Here is a breakdown of the costs:
£ Set, Props, and Costume – Our style of theatre is heavily dependent on the actors using lights on stage rather than completely relying on a conventional lighting rig. To do this we need to buy lights and batteries; a lot of batteries. To go along with this to make the best possible show we need costumes that will be made our designer and that will help with our storytelling on stage. 
£ Accommodation - We have secured accommodation at a great price using home stays which are the cheapest form of accommodation in the Lyme Regis Area.
£ Marketing costs – All shows require some level of marketing and we want to make an extra push to help promote the show to as large an audience as possible both in Lyme Regis and in London. We are receiving some marketing support from the venues we are performing at but would want to extend our marketing beyond our organic reach.
£ Travel - To get the company of five (4 actors and 1 director) as well as the props for the show to all the venues. We have a car that has been transporting us to and from Lyme Regis. Which has saved us on travel costs already. But with this initial saving we need to be able to afford insurance and petrol.
£ - Contingency - It is ALWAYS important to have contingency in case anything goes wrong. If we need extra marketing materials, emergency travel, broken props or hidden costs, this would cover it all.
Without your support we will not be able to make the a show that meets our high standards that we hold for ourselves as a company. Your help is very important to us and we have got some wonderful rewards to offer you for your generous contributions.
If you would like to see the show it debuts June 21st and 22nd at Marine Theatre in Lyme Regis. Followed quickly by a two-night stand at New Diorama Theatre in London on June 24th and 25th. We will also be performing the show at The Space in London on August 1st-5th.
Marine Theatre, Lyme Regis, 21st-22nd JuneNew Diorama, London, 23-24th JuneThe Space, London, 1st-5th August
Any amount you can donate will get us one step closer to creating a show that will be inspiring and breathtaking for our audiences. We will be incredibly grateful for anything you can give! Thank you for taking the time to look at our page, please share it if you can and we hope to see you at a showing of “12 Million Volts”.

<h3>A Quest For Treasure (in the form of digital funds)</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Sarah Fiete, and I have written the book, music, and lyrics for ""PYM: A New Musical."" I've been putting my Masters Degree in Musical Theatre Writing (NYU Tisch '15) to use by lovingly creating this full-length show for the past three years. Despite being one of his lesser-known works, Poe's ""The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket"" felt very familiar to me the first time I read it. The young (and reckless) best friends, the trials they stumble into, the descent into a surreal world... There are elements of his novel that feel indelible, not firmly planted within the context of 1838. And the sea, well, it sings.</p>
<p>A little over a year ago, I was fortunate enough to have director Marella Martin Koch join this project, and she has remained an integral part of its creation. ""PYM"" was first presented at Hudson Theatre's Dress Circle Lobby in April 2018 to a standing-room-only crowd. Since then, we have spent the last year diving deeper into the story and drumming up support for this work.</p>
<p>Recently, ""PYM"" was accepted into Dixon Place's programming. We are thrilled that this premiere venue for new and experimental work would lend us its stage. This performance will occur on  April 22, 2019, at 7:30pm. It is an Equity Showcase, bigger in scale than anything we've done with this project yet.</p>
<p>This Showcase will feature an incredibly talented group of individuals whose careers I am proud to support. And the work itself? We truly believe we've built something with an honest, unique voice, something that will make you laugh and cry and want to know these characters as friends. I am producing it because I believe in it; and from the feedback we've garnered so far, it's sparking interest, and others are believing in it, too.</p>
<p>But producing takes a great deal of time, effort, and money. And though the first two don't feel like a chore at all because I love this project so much, my love alone can't feed these artists.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So what does this mean?</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of the funding goes to paying these eleven artists (actors, directors, designers). They are the heart and soul of this production. We could have a bare stage and I would still be excited to show you our work because they are a part of it.</li>
<li>For supporting us, you can get custom gear for all your ocean (or beach) adventures, created by artists who have volunteered their time. (Don't forget to SELECT the Perk of choice when making your contribution!)</li>
<li>Funds will additionally be used for marketing, rehearsal space rental, set, and props.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The purpose of a Showcase is to, well, show off the work, to encourage a subsequent production. This show will not die at this stage. A few points of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is an opportunity to get on the ground level of a new musical. Being a contributor here means building a personal relationship with this team, one we won't forget the next time ""Pym"" is produced.</li>
<li>I have previously used IndieGogo to fund my song cycle, ""Hyperlink."" This song cycle's successful funding and presentation are directly responsible for where ""Pym"" is today.</li>
<li>Even if you aren't so sure about ""Pym"" itself, your contributions will support my ten fellow artists and their careers in the theatre industry.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If we don't reach our funding, ""PYM"" will still happen. When we received this opportunity, I made sure I was prepared to pay out of pocket if it came to that. However, the risk for paying out of pocket is two-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>The layered experience of the presentation would likely suffer, since we would be in Essentials Mode</li>
<li>It could diminish the chance of ""Pym"" being presented in the future</li>

<h2><strong>Taming of the Shrew</strong></h2>
<p>The idea of this project came when contemplating a season of shows that lift up empowered female voices. We knew we wanted to do a Shakespeare show with all female players, but in true Rising Tide fashion, we wanted to put our own twist on it. So, with the help of our friend/local playwright Natalie Liccardello, we turned Shakespeare's most notoriously chauvinistic play into an original piece about a group of women going through some serious therapy. We have cut Shakespeare's original script down to its bare bones and are bulking it up with improvisational comedy and modernized text, featuring some of KC's funniest female talent.</p>
<h2><strong>TotS Team</strong></h2>
<p>Producers: Casey Jane and Bob Linebarger</p>
<p>Board of Directors: Mark Mattison, Christie Kennard and Sarah Aptilon</p>
<p>Playwright: Natalie Liccardello</p>
<p>Director: Shawnna Journagan</p>
<p>Stage Manager: Becky Ochoa</p>
<p>Cast: Nicole Hall, Casey Jane, Briana Van Deusen, Charmaine Merriweather, Markeyta L. Young, Madilynn Mansur, Kathleen Mitchell, Margaret Shelby, Elizabeth A. Hillman, Emmy Panzica, and Lilly Meier </p>
<h2><strong>How Your Donations Will Help</strong></h2>
<p>We are working to raise the money for this show in multiple ways, but your Indiegogo contribution will go a long way. Here's what your contribution will go to:</p>
<p>- Compensation for the time and talent of our actors, tech crew, and stage manager</p>
<p>- Cost of venue</p>
<p>- Set, props, and costumes for the show</p>
<p>- Marketing materials</p>
<h2><strong>Rising Tide Productions</strong></h2>
<p>Rising Tide Productions is a new theatre company based out of Kansas City, MO. Formerly known as Different Choices, RTP is dedicated to highlighting fresh perspective, bringing new ideas and woke interpretations of old ideas to the forefront, while raising awareness and funds for local non-profits and enriching untapped KC markets with grassroots theatrical productions. RTP is run by Bob Linebarger and Casey Jane, two passionate artists who thrive on how differences and collaboration bring power to expression. So far, RTP has six full productions under its belt: The Bottom of Everything, at KC Fringe 2012; Danny and the Deep Blue Sea in 2014, Matt and Ben in 2015, Silly Animals: A Comedy of the Human Drama in 2016, Elephant by Lewis Morrow in 2018, and The Summer House by Christie Kennard in 2019.</p>
<p>We know that the privileged can and must learn to listen to the oppressed, and by truly understanding these stories, progress will be made toward the empathetic existence we are all capable of. Through communication and collaboration we can rise above the ways in which we hold ourselves back, and we believe it is stories like ones we have produced and will continue to produce that help push us forward and up toward that goal.</p>

</p><p>La <i>Compagnie Vadé</i>,
c'est d'abord la rencontre entre 6 comédiens formés à l'Ecole
Internationale de Théâtre Lassaâd à Bruxelles... et puis, de
cette rencontre l'envie de créer des projets, des spectacles, des
chansons. L'envie de s'attaquer à un univers, qui joue avec les mots
et les images. Ensemble, nous souhaitons travailler sur une humanité
sans fars : l'Homme aussi beau que laid. A travers un humour noir,
qui rit de ce qui dérange, et qui s'amuse des conventions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actuellement, nous sommes
en création d'un spectacle de chants polyphonique : <i>Bestiaire
Musical. </i>Il se jouera dans un
premier temps aux mois de Mars, Avril et Mai entre la France et la
Belgique.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pour
créer ce <i>Bestiaire</i>, nous travaillons régulièrement sous
forme de résidences, dans différents lieux de la belle Bruxelles,
mais aussi dans le Nord de la France. Nous investissons avec nos
propres fonds sur les costumes, la scénographie, les déplacements,
les lieux de résidences et tous les frais qui en découlent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Par
la suite, nous voudrions voir ce <i>Bestiaire Musical</i> grandir et
se transformer en véritable spectacle modulable selon les lieux et
évènements (théâtre, cabarets, bars, performance, lieux
insolites...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>C'est
pourquoi nous avons décidé de faire appel à vous, à vos dons,
afin de mener à bien ce premier projet, et lancer efficacement ceux
à venir !</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>A
quoi servira la collecte ?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
Vos dons nous permettrons, très simplement, de mener à bien toute
cette aventure, de partir sur de bonnes bases pour cette compagnie
naissante. Nous devons investir notamment dans la création de
costumes, de maquillages, mais aussi la location de matériel pour
les représentations à venir.</p>
<p>
Ce fond servira également à financer nos futures séances de
répétitions, car les lieux ont un prix, mais aussi les déplacements
qui se joignent à tout ça.</p>
<p>
Nous avons également fait appel à un réalisateur pour tourner
notre premier clip, qui nous suivra tout au long de nos aventures
théâtrales.</p>
<p>
Votre contribution nous permettra d'inviter et de collaborer avec
d'autres artistes musiciens, chanteurs, comédiens, costumiers,
danseurs... dans notre souhait de créer un spectacle
pluridisciplinaire.</p>
<p>
Pour finir, ces dons nous servirons à communiquer efficacement sur
la diffusion de ce spectacle à travers flyers et affiches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Avec votre soutien financier, vous contribuerez à la création et la
diffusion de nos spectacles et vous permettrez ainsi l'essor de cette
jeune compagnie pleine d'envie ! Avec votre aide, nous pourrons
continuer avec une grande joie à développer nos projets et à
rendre réelles nos idées les plus folles !</p><p><br/></p>

Six personnages décalés, issus de différents horizons décident de
mêler leurs univers dans des chants communs. Leur répertoire est

russes...) à des morceaux de jazz en passant par le slam et le

d'intention</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
En février 2015, nous avons découvert le dadaïsme, en travaillant
sur la Ursonate de Kurt Schwitters, et ce que ce mouvement offre
comme liberté de création. 
</p>
<p>
Nous avons été très touchés par les sonorités qu’offraient des
mots dépourvus de sens et leur musicalité. C’est à ce moment-là
que l’envie de monter un spectacle de chant polyphonique nous est
venue. 
</p>
<p>
Bestiaire Musical, est le résultat de plusieurs recherches, de
plusieurs rencontres avec des styles musicaux tout à fait
différents. Nous nous sommes nourris d'univers tels que les chants
grégoriens, chants des balkans et des groupes comme les <i>Dakh
Daughters</i>, <i>La Mal Coiffée</i>, <i>Double 6.</i>
</p>
<p>
Dans ce spectacle, nous travaillons la matière vocale, nous nous
amusons avec les instruments que nos six voix offrent et en faisons
une partition. Nous avons commencé par des reprises et puis par
improvisations nous avons débuté nos propres compositions. Par nos
différents timbres de voix des personnages se sont dessinés. S’en
est suivi un travail sur les costumes et les maquillages très
poussés, afin de mettre en exergue l’histoire de chacun et que
l’image parle d’elle-même. Ainsi nous avons mêlé mouvements et
voix.  C’est un vrai patchwork musical.</p><p><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>L'équipe</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b></b></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461504224/Compagnie_Vad%C3%A9_com%C3%A9diens_noms_brnock.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p></p><p><b>Pauline

La Compagnie Vadé,
c'est d'abord la rencontre entre 6 comédiens formés à l'Ecole
Internationale de Théâtre Lassaâd à Bruxelles... et puis, de
cette rencontre l'envie de créer des projets, des spectacles, des
chansons. L'envie de s'attaquer à un univers, qui joue avec les mots
et les images. Ensemble, nous souhaitons travailler sur une humanité
sans fars : l'Homme aussi beau que laid. A travers un humour noir,
qui rit de ce qui dérange, et qui s'amuse des conventions.

Actuellement, nous sommes
en création d'un spectacle de chants polyphonique : Bestiaire
Musical. Il se jouera dans un
premier temps aux mois de Mars, Avril et Mai entre la France et la
Belgique.

Pour
créer ce Bestiaire, nous travaillons régulièrement sous
forme de résidences, dans différents lieux de la belle Bruxelles,
mais aussi dans le Nord de la France. Nous investissons avec nos
propres fonds sur les costumes, la scénographie, les déplacements,
les lieux de résidences et tous les frais qui en découlent.

Par
la suite, nous voudrions voir ce Bestiaire Musical grandir et
se transformer en véritable spectacle modulable selon les lieux et
évènements (théâtre, cabarets, bars, performance, lieux
insolites...).

C'est
pourquoi nous avons décidé de faire appel à vous, à vos dons,
afin de mener à bien ce premier projet, et lancer efficacement ceux
à venir !


A
quoi servira la collecte ?


Vos dons nous permettrons, très simplement, de mener à bien toute
cette aventure, de partir sur de bonnes bases pour cette compagnie
naissante. Nous devons investir notamment dans la création de
costumes, de maquillages, mais aussi la location de matériel pour
les représentations à venir.

Ce fond servira également à financer nos futures séances de
répétitions, car les lieux ont un prix, mais aussi les déplacements
qui se joignent à tout ça.

Nous avons également fait appel à un réalisateur pour tourner
notre premier clip, qui nous suivra tout au long de nos aventures
théâtrales.

Votre contribution nous permettra d'inviter et de collaborer avec
d'autres artistes musiciens, chanteurs, comédiens, costumiers,
danseurs... dans notre souhait de créer un spectacle
pluridisciplinaire.

Pour finir, ces dons nous servirons à communiquer efficacement sur
la diffusion de ce spectacle à travers flyers et affiches.


Avec votre soutien financier, vous contribuerez à la création et la
diffusion de nos spectacles et vous permettrez ainsi l'essor de cette
jeune compagnie pleine d'envie ! Avec votre aide, nous pourrons
continuer avec une grande joie à développer nos projets et à
rendre réelles nos idées les plus folles !



Le
Bestiaire Musical


Mise en scène et chef de chœur - Sophie Lavallée 


Avec Pauline Caraglio, Viki Kesmaecker, Sophie Lavallée, Lisa Lecoq,
Eva Schumacher et Emre Yildizlar.


Le
spectacle 



La Compagnie Vadé propose un spectacle de Théâtre Musical.
Six personnages décalés, issus de différents horizons décident de
mêler leurs univers dans des chants communs. Leur répertoire est
des plus éclectiques. Allant de chants traditionnels (tsiganes,
russes...) à des morceaux de jazz en passant par le slam et le
cabaret, ces six énergumènes nous emmènent dans un univers décalé
plein d'humour et de charme. En s'appropriant ces chants, ils vous
emmèneront dans un voyage à travers les émotions.


Note
d'intention


En février 2015, nous avons découvert le dadaïsme, en travaillant
sur la Ursonate de Kurt Schwitters, et ce que ce mouvement offre
comme liberté de création. 


Nous avons été très touchés par les sonorités qu’offraient des
mots dépourvus de sens et leur musicalité. C’est à ce moment-là
que l’envie de monter un spectacle de chant polyphonique nous est
venue. 


Bestiaire Musical, est le résultat de plusieurs recherches, de
plusieurs rencontres avec des styles musicaux tout à fait
différents. Nous nous sommes nourris d'univers tels que les chants
grégoriens, chants des balkans et des groupes comme les Dakh
Daughters, La Mal Coiffée, Double 6.


Dans ce spectacle, nous travaillons la matière vocale, nous nous
amusons avec les instruments que nos six voix offrent et en faisons
une partition. Nous avons commencé par des reprises et puis par
improvisations nous avons débuté nos propres compositions. Par nos
différents timbres de voix des personnages se sont dessinés. S’en
est suivi un travail sur les costumes et les maquillages très
poussés, afin de mettre en exergue l’histoire de chacun et que
l’image parle d’elle-même. Ainsi nous avons mêlé mouvements et
voix.  C’est un vrai patchwork musical.L'équipe------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pauline

Festival highlights will be performed in central Kharkiv.• Street art competition will bring together local artists to paint murals of Kulish, Kurbas and Shakespeare in the courtyard of Teatr Arabesky. What’s MAKLENA all about?Our production of MAKLENA is an adaptation of Mykola Kulish’s poetic tragicomedy, written in 1933 during the Stalinist period. After Kulish was executed by the Soviet authorities, his works were banned and MAKLENA was lost to the world for decades.Our production incorporates original music, puppetry, and physical theatre to depict the rich fantasy world of the play and highlight its sharp contemporary resonance. The play tackles questions that remain globally immediate: the place of ideology in society and the dangers of taking it to the extreme. All Aboard: Who Is Night Train?Night Train is an emerging ensemble theatre company dedicated to sharing vibrant and compelling stories from around the world.We will work with a range of collaborators to bring MAKLENA to life, including:
Night Train founding members Maria Montague (Director, Translator), Oliver Vibrans (Composer), Léa des Garets (Actor), and Alona Bach (Actor)
Movement Director Lana Biba

Set, Puppets, and Costume Designer Nikki Charlesworth

Actors Eden Harbud, Adam Mirsky, Matthew Coulton, Andreea Tudose

Co-Tour Managers Bohdan Tokarsky, Danielle Craig

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>“The biggest challenge was people believing that we were actually writing a full-scale, original Musical or that we could have it ready in 9 months”, says Bechtel who is now rehearsing with a 50+ member cast and crew in preparations for its debut May 23rd -25th. “We are unbelievably excited to see this begin to come to life!” After his initial concept work was complete, the book and songs began to take shape last summer when he solicited two young, talented collaborators Makayla Allen to help with lyrics and David Heras as co-writer. What developed was a unique story set in an rich, ancient world with a musical mix that taps from not only its cultural traditions but also more modern styles such as blues and Jazz to deliver the message. Bechtel, who is also working on the final costume and set designs is gearing up for the ambitious musical production. However he finds himself blown-away by it’s evolution and what this young cast and crew are building together from ground zero. “We feel audiences who see this will be amazed at what a group of young artists can achieve”.</p>

<p>For 2013, MOVEiUS is hard at work preparing <strong><em>Big River (and Other Wayfaring Ballets) for the Capital Fringe Festival</em></strong>. This mixed repertory program walks the line between classical and contemporary, bringing works from capital region choreographers Diana Movius, Kimberly Parmer, Florian Rouiller, and Katya Vasilaky to new audiences.  Headlining the program is Big River, a journey of emotional development through country music.  Known for innovative choreographic concepts, MOVEiUS won the 2012 <strong>Fringe Audience Award</strong> for dance &amp; physical theater for our steampunk ballet <em>Flight of Fanc</em>y.</p>
<p><strong>But we need your help.</strong></p>
<p>At this point, all the pieces on our program are in rehearsal. Kim has finished choreographing and setting the first 10 (out of 25 minutes) of our headlining ballet <em>Big River</em>, but in order to get these ballets performance-ready, we need more rehearsal time! On top of that, MOVEiUS is known for our high quality, fully produced performances. But like most arts organizations, bringing back our cast of 13 dancers, along with paying for costumes, lighting design and pointe shoes (which cost $75 per pair!), costs more than we take in through ticket sales. </p>
<p><strong>Our $2000 goal is the amount we need to pay for shoes, 20 more hours of paid studio time (in addition to the many hours graciously donated by various studios in the Bethesda and Rockville area), lighting design, and costumes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About MOVEiUS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>MOVEiUS Contemporary Ballet</strong> (formerly MOVEiUS Dance) was founded in 2010 to catalyze the creation and public presentation of innovative, accessible, and thoughtful contemporary ballet. MOVEiUS responded to an urgent need in the arts community to promote local ballet choreography, opportunities for professional ballet dancers, and affordable community ballet performances and officially became Montgomery County's only contemporary ballet company in 2013. MOVEiUS is committed to bringing diverse ballet-based choreography to DC metro audiences. <strong><em>Big River (and Other Wayfaring Ballets)</em></strong><strong> will premiere in July 2013. </strong>This production is presented as a part of the 2013 Capital Fringe Festival, a program of the Washington, DC non-profit Capital Fringe.</p>
<p>In the three years since the company's inception, MOVEiUS has received critical acclaim for its performances throughout the DC Metro area, appearing at venues such as Dance Place, the Atlas Performing Arts Center, and the Woolly Mammoth.</p>

<p><b>About The Author</b></p>
<p>Norah Foster, the enticing, engaging and eager retired manager of graduate services at the UC Berkeley Library and new late blooming playwright, wrote <b><i>Madame Gufay </i></b>over a period of years, incorporating many events that she personally experienced, as well as plot twists that emanated directly from her vivid imagination.  She began working as a volunteer at Actors Ensemble, and as an experiment on our part we produced her play originally as a workshop/staged reading.  It showed enough promise (and Norah enough enthusiasm in helping to get to the next step) that we have taken it upon ourselves to produce it as a full play, performed over two weekends in December.</p>
<p><b><i>Madame Gufay</i></b> is our little holiday gift to Berkeley from Norah, the director Alan Barkan, and <b><i>AE</i></b>, something to brighten up your life as you busily prepare for the holidays.</p>

<p>We have a great cast already in rehearsals: Simone Bloch, Sarang Cho Lee, Chris Habash, Scott Alexander Ayres, Edward Kimak, Tom Westlake, Alicia Barela, Vicki Zabarte, Patrick Glenn, Martha Luehrmann, Chris Cruz, CJ Gross, Cai Shaotian, Caoi Shaotian, and Andrea Granera.</p><p>And a crew all excited to make magic happen: Carmen Yu, Juliet Pfafker, Harriet Hache.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Morer to come!</span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </b></p>
<p><b>Play Synopsis</b></p>
<p>Growing up in the French provinces, Madame Gufay was fascinated by news reports of the Free Speech Movement (the FSM) which fermented on the campus of U.C. Berkeley and resonated worldwide.  Now, having returned to school late in life, she has arranged to finish her last semester studying at her own personal mecca, U.C. Berkeley.  Madame Gufay is a force of nature, and her wacky, goofy efforts to experience Free Speech in the present day involve most campus life: the administration and academics, the classroom, the library, Sproul Plaza demonstrations and, of course graduation.</p>
<p><b><i>Madame Gufay</i></b> overcomes language challenges, academic arrogance, uncontrollable urges, public drunkenness, lewd and lascivious behavior, to the fulfillment of innocent wacky, goofy dreams. To be sure, Madame Gufay and her activist Lovelutionaries do care passionately about social justice and they advocate for world peace, justice, not to mention lowering tuition for public universities! Madame Gufay's character is based loosely on the famous director Jacques Tati's Mr. Hulot who also had hilarious adventures.</p>
<p><b>Program Budget Information</b></p>
<p>In order to sustain this new program and cover the production costs it is necessary to raise $2500 in addition to the projected ticket sales of $3000.00.  A budget summary follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal Space Rental - $1,200.00</li>

<p>If we EXCEED our goal, all such funds will be used to support future <b><i>AE</i></b> projects.  No theatre company supports itself entirely with ticket sales - and we are no exception. </p>

<p><b>THE
SHOW</b></p>
<p><i>Special Relativity</i> is a full-length, contemporary circus show of original material
conceptualized by Stacey Kigner and Allison McDermott, and created in
partnership with <a href=""www.airtemple.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Air Temple Arts</a>. It will debut in New Haven, Connecticut in
January 2015, with plans to adapt it for touring. </p>
<p>In <i>Special Relativity </i>a steel
magnate from the 1890s finds both his mettle and the depth of his devotion
tested when a space/time accident separates him from his betrothed. If he’s going
to have any chance of seeing her again he has no choice but to follow her path
through the time vortex. </p>
<p>We’ll travel from the Stone Age to a dystopian future, telling the story
of <i>Special Relativity</i> through Chinese
pole, aerial dance, acrobatics, contortion, Spanish web and more. </p>
<p>Beyond creating an inventive, and entertaining show that we can’t wait to
perform for you, we’re hoping to continue to widen the audience for circus in
Connecticut and greater New England. Now we want to create a touring show that
has a home base in New Haven—something that’s never been done before.</p>
<p><b>THE TEAM</b></p>
<p><i>Special Relativity </i>features a cast of eight performers, all of whom are coaches and/or
students at Air Temple Arts. They are: <b>Allison</b> (trapeze, aerial silks, juggling,
acrobatics), <b>Brianna</b> (contortion), <b>Elaine</b> (aerial silks), <b>Elsa</b>
(aerial straps), <b>Lauren</b> (duo lyra, aerial silks, acrobatics), <b>Lee</b>
(hula hooping), <b>Nick</b> (Chinese pole, juggling, acrobatics), <b>Stacey</b>
(Spanish web, aerial silks, duo lyra, juggling, acrobatics).</p>
<p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/982994/files/20141103122500-DSC_0337_copy.jpg?1415046300"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>THE FUNDS</b></p>
<p>In order to produce this ambitious show we need to raise a bare minimum
of $5,500. That money will cover the cost of renting the theater for
performances and rehearsal, tech for the show (including lights, sound, and
projection), and a small stipend for our eight performers. </p>
<p>If we can raise more than that though, we can cover the cost of props,
costumes, promotional material, and start laying the groundwork to bring Special
Relativity on the road.</p>
<p>It’s a lot of money to ask for, but we’re confident in our ability to
produce this amazing show. This isn’t our first time in the (circus) ring.</p>
<p>In 2012 we produced <i><a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/643894418/missed-connections-a-full-length-circus-show"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Missed Connections</a></i>—a small ensemble show about the personals section of
Craigslist. </p>
<p>In 2013 Stacey opened Air Temple Arts—Connecticut’s first aerial dance
and circus studio, which had to undergo expansion less than a year after
opening. Both endeavors have been highly successful, and we have a dedicated
community backing us. </p>
<p>The curtains will go up on <i>Special
Relativity</i> in January whether or not we reach our funding goal. We’ve put
far too much into the show so far, both creatively and financially to
not see our vision through to the end (even if it means we live off ramen for
the next eight months), but we hope you’ll help us take <i>Special Relativity</i> beyond our January dates, and hopefully into a
theater near you!</p>
<p><b>THE REWARDS</b></p>
<p>We have tons of fabulous rewards—both physical and physically
demanding—in exchange for your generosity! </p>
<p>In the physical realm we have a number of wonderful rewards. In addition
to stickers and show swag, we decided this was the perfect time to make Air
Temple gear available to the public, since our students there have been asking
for it for over a year. Below you’ll see examples of some of our favorite gear
offerings:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/982970/files/20141103121226-illusion_jacket_edit.png?1415045546"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/982974/files/20141103121330-air_temple_tank.jpg?1415045610"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>In the physically demanding realm—most of our performers in <i>Special Relativity</i> are also coaches at
Air Temple—what better way to let us show you our appreciation than by kicking
your butt in the studio? At various reward levels we’re offering Open Studio*
time, classes and private lessons at Air Temple.</p>

show and studio pages, and spreading the word about all of the above on
facebook, and whatever other social media platform you use!<div>

projection), and a small stipend for our eight performers. 
If we can raise more than that though, we can cover the cost of props,
costumes, promotional material, and start laying the groundwork to bring Special
Relativity on the road.
It’s a lot of money to ask for, but we’re confident in our ability to
produce this amazing show. This isn’t our first time in the (circus) ring.
In 2012 we produced Missed Connections—a small ensemble show about the personals section of
Craigslist. 
In 2013 Stacey opened Air Temple Arts—Connecticut’s first aerial dance
and circus studio, which had to undergo expansion less than a year after
opening. Both endeavors have been highly successful, and we have a dedicated
community backing us. 
The curtains will go up on Special
Relativity in January whether or not we reach our funding goal. We’ve put
far too much into the show so far, both creatively and financially to
not see our vision through to the end (even if it means we live off ramen for
the next eight months), but we hope you’ll help us take Special Relativity beyond our January dates, and hopefully into a
theater near you!
THE REWARDS
We have tons of fabulous rewards—both physical and physically
demanding—in exchange for your generosity! 
In the physical realm we have a number of wonderful rewards. In addition
to stickers and show swag, we decided this was the perfect time to make Air
Temple gear available to the public, since our students there have been asking
for it for over a year. Below you’ll see examples of some of our favorite gear
offerings:In the physically demanding realm—most of our performers in Special Relativity are also coaches at
Air Temple—what better way to let us show you our appreciation than by kicking
your butt in the studio? At various reward levels we’re offering Open Studio*
time, classes and private lessons at Air Temple.
Beyond donating, you can help by sharing our campaign, checking out our
show and studio pages, and spreading the word about all of the above on
facebook, and whatever other social media platform you use!
 
*Open Studio time is only open to practicing circus students and
performers.

<p>Triad Health Project is committed to tailoring their services to meet
 the ever-changing needs of clients. Following the development over the 
past few years of newer, more effective treatments for HIV and AIDS, 
clients are living long and healthy lives, enjoying relationships,

<p>Unfortunately, accessing adequate medical care and medications to

by professionals specifically trained and experienced in the field of 
HIV. THP fights against the stigma that continues to be a barrier to

counseling and therapeutic groups to individuals and families who are 
learning to cope with HIV.</p>

</p><p><b>Who we are</b></p>
<p>Lehenda Ukrainian Dance Company is a
newly formed Ukrainian Dance organisation, based in Melbourne, Victoria under
the Artistic Direction of Merited Artist of Ukraine, Melanie Moravski Dechnicz.
</p>
<p>For the past 9 years Melania has been
working with Verchovyna Ukrainian Dance Ensemble, Ukrainian Youth Association Melbourne as a volunteer
in the position of Artistic Director. In February 2014 she announced this new
company Lehenda!</p>
<p>Lehenda Ukrainian Dance Company is currently made up of 43 dancers who perform with pride, passion and embody the true soul
of Ukrainian culture. The strength, beauty and grace of Ukrainian Cossack
dancers, combine to give you the contagious energy, spectacle, colour and
spirit that is, Ukrainian dance!</p>
<p><b>What we need?</b></p>
<p>Lehenda are eager to get on stage and
perform! We have been lucky enough to borrow a small number of costumes to
perform over the last few months, however the full company will be performing
at a huge Ukrainian Dance event, Hopak in the Park at the Sidney Myer Music
Bowl in Melbourne on 26 April 2014. We need to make a large number of costumes to
dress our wonderful dancers!<br/><br/>
By donating to our costume fund you will enable Lehenda to share the Ukrainian
Dance Culture and give Australian dancers the opportunity and privilege to perform
Ukrainian Dance.</p>
<p><b>How will the
money be used?</b></p>
<p>Lehenda is starting from scratch.
Ukrainian national costumes are intricate and have many different pieces. It is very
important to us that we create authentic costumes to accurately represent the rich Ukrainian
Culture.  </p>
<p>Ukrainian dance has different
costumes for different regions. As we grow, we will need to create costumes for these various regions. However our initial goal is to create Central Ukrainian Costumes for
our performance at Hopak in the Park.</p>
<p>Funds raised will go towards buying
fabric, trims, beads, flowers, ribbons, elastic, threads and everything else
required to create the Central Ukrainian Costume.</p><p>You will be helping us create the Lehenda legacy. The costumes we create will be worn for many years to come by generations of Ukrainian Dancers!</p>
<p><b>What will you
get?</b></p>
<p>By helping us get onstage you will be
part of our history! You will help us get on our way and become a Company!</p>
<p>Lehenda Artists and dancers will be
forever grateful.  You will become part
of our Lehenda family!</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Our short shared
history</b></p>
<p>Lehenda is a
new company staffed by experienced people who have achieved countless individual
successes.</p>
<p>Our costume
department have between them successfully designed and sewn costumes for
Ukrainian Dance Touring productions, Schools and Ballet Productions. <br/><br/>
With your help this terrific team can create a wonderful product, providing opportunities to dancers and audiences in Australia and world wide.</p>

Lehenda are eager to get on stage and
perform! We have been lucky enough to borrow a small number of costumes to
perform over the last few months, however the full company will be performing
at a huge Ukrainian Dance event, Hopak in the Park at the Sidney Myer Music
Bowl in Melbourne on 26 April 2014. We need to make a large number of costumes to
dress our wonderful dancers!
By donating to our costume fund you will enable Lehenda to share the Ukrainian
Dance Culture and give Australian dancers the opportunity and privilege to perform
Ukrainian Dance.
How will the
money be used?
Lehenda is starting from scratch.
Ukrainian national costumes are intricate and have many different pieces. It is very
important to us that we create authentic costumes to accurately represent the rich Ukrainian
Culture.  
Ukrainian dance has different
costumes for different regions. As we grow, we will need to create costumes for these various regions. However our initial goal is to create Central Ukrainian Costumes for
our performance at Hopak in the Park.
Funds raised will go towards buying
fabric, trims, beads, flowers, ribbons, elastic, threads and everything else
required to create the Central Ukrainian Costume.You will be helping us create the Lehenda legacy. The costumes we create will be worn for many years to come by generations of Ukrainian Dancers!
What will you
get?
By helping us get onstage you will be
part of our history! You will help us get on our way and become a Company!
Lehenda Artists and dancers will be
forever grateful.  You will become part
of our Lehenda family!
Our short shared
history
