<h3>LOVE IS THE KEY TO SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION!</h3></b>
<p>
</p>
<p>I found out, before reaching the age of two that I
needed to torment my baby brother. He had to cry so that I could survive. My
brother was thirteen months my junior and had come between my mother and I. All
of the attention and the affection that I had enjoyed before his arrival had disappeared
in an instant.</p>
<p>Loss of connection messes with a toddler’s mind – it
has the power to transform that child into someone they should never have
become. When the source of my affection got cut off, I remember feeling painfully
isolated and abandoned. My perception of isolation was literally killing me. Out
of desperation, I conceived a strategy for redirecting her attention and I used
that strategy well into my teen years. It involved pestering and bullying my
younger brother, until his tears had caused my mother enough distress for her to
direct her full attention toward me. When I finally received the attention that
I was craving, it wasn’t the kind of attention that I had intended. But,
desperate for any attention whatsoever, I preferred my mother’s fury and her
punishments to the feeling that I didn’t exist and that I was unworthy of love.
I hated my life; I hated my mother; I hated my brother and I hated myself. My
life was out of control. </p>
<p>Immersed in hate and self-loathing, I wasn’t
particularly pleasant to be around and so my loneliness expanded well beyond
our family and into my school and my social life. And the lonelier I felt, the
more I hated.</p>
<p>When it eventually came time for me to find a partner,
the women attracted to me were women who were accustomed to living in a climate
of subdued anger and hate. Knowing that few women would be willing to remain in
a relationship with someone as flawed as me, I desperately hung on to my
partners. These relationships lasted well beyond their expiry dates and when we
finally separated, the fallout felt excruciatingly painful.  There came a point
during my thirties when I realised that I wouldn’t survive another
heart-rending break-up. The time had come for me to find some way to transmute
my hate and a lifetime’s feelings of inadequacy into love, if that was even
possible. To thrive, I needed to understand what love is and I needed, more
than anything, to learn how to love. So, I embarked on a quest with one singular
goal: To <b>learn how to love</b>. My quest brought me into contact with the
works of many great teachers and their wisdom then formed the foundation upon
which my <b>Learning to Love</b> programs have been constructed. </p>
<p>The more that I learnt about love, the more healthy my
romantic relationships became and the Philip who emerged from my quest is a different
person from the Philip who started it. As time went by, it became easier for me
to, to feel loved and to understand that I am truly worthy of acceptance. The me
that emerged has no use for hate and no further need to be a bully. My life
rocks. It’s free from drama and I love being the person who I have become.</p>
<p>My healing journey was an arduous one, requiring perseverance
and exceptional courage, but not all journeys need to be so difficult. As I
progressed through the stages of healing, I started noticing how important it
was to feel safe - my biggest transformations were occurring when I could feel 100%
safe in my vulnerability. I discovered that the secret to embracing my shameful
history and my dark shadow was safety.</p>
<p>Emotional safety unlocks a door to gentle and
accelerated personal growth. <b><i>“Learning to Love – Your Guide to Personal
Empowerment”</i></b>, my new book was carefully written to ensure
that no person is ever blamed or made to be wrong – everybody make choices and does
things in a particular way for very good reasons, reasons that are rarely

loneliness, then I would still be living a life of pain and isolation today.</p>

A few provocative ideas from 'Learning to Love': 

Anxiety, depression, conflict and greed are frequently symptoms of insecure connection.

Patterns or trauma, dysfunction and addiction are often the result of insecure connection. They get passed  unconsciously from parent to child. We now know how to disrupt  these patterns and to heal most of the wounding.
Falling in love requires three conditions: unconditional acceptance, secure connection and deep understanding. The first time that we feel judged or criticized by our partner, love gets shattered.
The root of almost all conflict can be traced  back to a person's unconscious fear of losing connection.

When Learning to Love hits the shelves in November, it will fundamentally shift the way that anxiety, depression, violence and greed are understood. 

Learning to Love offers readers the tools necessary for de-escalating conflicts at every conceivable level.
If we succeed in getting Learning to Love into schools, community groups and into the hands of  social workers and counselors then this book could lead to a
reduction in family violence, bullying and suicide.  A 1% reduction in family violence in Canada alone would impact roughly 4400 Canadian
families over a 5 year period.

<h3>Project Based Learning Introduces: Project Prodigy </h3>
<p><b>An amazing solution to a difficult problem.</b></p>
<p><b>Here is the problem:</b></p>
<p>Home access to computers and the internet has expanded dramatically over the last two decades. However, a surprising number of children are being left behind in their education due to a lack of access to home computers. Without computers at home, the children are often condemned to struggling to keep up with the other children in both essential school studies and the basic computer skills that are becoming necessary to thrive in modern society. Many school tests are now administered on computers, if the student does not have a basic understanding of computers that students test scores can be low. </p>
<p>They fall behind. </p>
<p>In the United States, 8% of White children, 26% of Black children and 31% of Hispanic children have no access to a computer at home. Most of these children come from families earning less than $15,000 per year, so their chance of getting a home computer and getting caught up with other students is not good. </p>
<p>At the same time, millions of older and ""out-dated"" computers are tucked away in garages, scrapped for metal, or dumped in landfills.</p>
<p><b>Here is our solution:</b></p>
<p>Project Based Learning, together with its Space Coast FabLab facility, serves as a community innovation center. Membership is free and individuals of all ages come in to the lab every day to take advantage of the computers, 3D printers and shop equipment offered free of charge and to make prototypes of their ideas and inventions.</p>
<p>Most of the equipment at the FabLab has been donated. It is usually missing pieces to be fully operational by the time we get it, but we have many engineering student volunteers from the Florida Tech's PIKE and APO fraternities who pitch in to rehabilitate donated equipment and make these discarded items into usable tools. Along these lines, we recently received a donation of over 100 used computers from a local business. </p>
<p>The computers are on average three years old, and each one is missing different parts because the older computers where used as a parts source for some of the newer computers. Some are just basically a box of parts. Others are missing ram, batteries, cords, have failed drives, etc. </p>
<p>The good news is that each computer has an accompanying monitor, keyboard, mouse and even speakers, making each one a very nice and complete system once the missing pieces are replaced and everything is assembled. </p>
<p>The goal with Project Prodigy is as follows:</p>
<p>1) Re-fabricate all 100+ computers to include missing parts and update older components that are needed to make the computers run current software.</p>
<p>2) Load each computer with a complete suite of software, including Microsoft Office processing programs.</p>
<p>3) Consult with local school and welfare officials to identify families with school aged children that do not have access to a home computer.</p>
<p>4) Hold free classes for those families including how to set-up, mantain and operate the systems, how to create basic documents and spreadsheets, computer safety and computer security.</p>
<p>5) Upon completion of training, award each participating family a complete computer system.</p>
<p>6) Offer participating families an assortment of continuing software and training classes to allow them to get caught-up with their peers.</p>
<p>This means that over 100 families will be impacted directly and significantly by this project within the next few months. If you think about it, that is a lot of positive change with very visible results.<br/></p>

<h3>About Us ....</h3> <ul> <li>Project Based Learning Inc. (PBL, a Florida Non-Profit) runs Space Coast FabLab and is part of an official chain from the MIT Center of Bits and Atoms. The use of the FabLab (Fabrication Lab) and classroom combination to create a collaborative innovation center offers a truly unique experience in education. Utilizing a project-based approach, PBL offers numerous pathways to STEM education as diverse as the population it serves.<br/><br/>Participants working to complete a “project” see the math, science, and technology as simple steps toward a personalized goal, instead of a dry textbook or lecture.<br/><br/>Projects are supported by classroom offerings ranging from children’s snap circuit workshops to advanced FPGA programming and family activities offering the community at large an opportunity to see, feel, and use advanced engineering tools applied to their daily lives. <br/><br/>Each month as many as 300 new community members have visited PBL for the first time. Their ages range from 5 yrs. old to early 80s. Their backgrounds and socio-economic standings are just as diverse. The common thread is an excitement about innovation and the desire to achieve the goal of a completed project. <br/><br/>It is our intention to expand to over 50 classes, K-12 outreach programs, and Teach-the-Teacher programs, in addition to the normal FabLab activities and family nights. <br/><br/>It doesn’t matter what their background is, they’re learning how to find and leverage the knowledge of others and in open/free resources. Students learn to work with other people. A process allowing all levels to contribute to projects. <br/><br/><p>PLB currently offers: </p>

<p>PBL currently services the community from two separate locations. Over 10,000 students attend school within 3.5 miles of our facilities.  This is combined with current and continued access to tech startup, university students, local engineers, retirees, and the community as a whole.</p>

</div><div> <p>Because we do not charge people for most equipment and facilities use, our budget is rather minimal. That said, we do have a seemingly endless supply of volunteers willing to assist with this and other worthwhile projects. Most are students, some are retirees. Others come in to use the equipment and wind up spending a lot of time on projects and then end up volunteering to help others.</p>
<p>We already have the initial computers, the assembly and repair people, and the volunteer teachers for the basic computer skills classes. The only unfunded  expense is to purchase the parts needed to rehabilitate the computers, software fees, and package the systems safely for their trip home.</p>
<p>The total cost (because we shop wisely) is estimated to be less than $100 per complete system, or approximately $96. That includes replacing some broken monitors and other more expensive pieces.</p>
<p>If funds raised turn out to be less than we need we believe we can come up with the difference for our own volunteers. If not we will distribute as many as we can. If it winds up being more funding than we need, we can expand the program to another 5 or 10 families.</p> </div> <div> <h3>

</div> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","Project Based Learning Introduces: Project Prodigy 
An amazing solution to a difficult problem.
Here is the problem:
Home access to computers and the internet has expanded dramatically over the last two decades. However, a surprising number of children are being left behind in their education due to a lack of access to home computers. Without computers at home, the children are often condemned to struggling to keep up with the other children in both essential school studies and the basic computer skills that are becoming necessary to thrive in modern society. Many school tests are now administered on computers, if the student does not have a basic understanding of computers that students test scores can be low. 
They fall behind. 
In the United States, 8% of White children, 26% of Black children and 31% of Hispanic children have no access to a computer at home. Most of these children come from families earning less than $15,000 per year, so their chance of getting a home computer and getting caught up with other students is not good. 
At the same time, millions of older and ""out-dated"" computers are tucked away in garages, scrapped for metal, or dumped in landfills.
Here is our solution:
Project Based Learning, together with its Space Coast FabLab facility, serves as a community innovation center. Membership is free and individuals of all ages come in to the lab every day to take advantage of the computers, 3D printers and shop equipment offered free of charge and to make prototypes of their ideas and inventions.
Most of the equipment at the FabLab has been donated. It is usually missing pieces to be fully operational by the time we get it, but we have many engineering student volunteers from the Florida Tech's PIKE and APO fraternities who pitch in to rehabilitate donated equipment and make these discarded items into usable tools. Along these lines, we recently received a donation of over 100 used computers from a local business. 
The computers are on average three years old, and each one is missing different parts because the older computers where used as a parts source for some of the newer computers. Some are just basically a box of parts. Others are missing ram, batteries, cords, have failed drives, etc. 
The good news is that each computer has an accompanying monitor, keyboard, mouse and even speakers, making each one a very nice and complete system once the missing pieces are replaced and everything is assembled. 
The goal with Project Prodigy is as follows:
1) Re-fabricate all 100+ computers to include missing parts and update older components that are needed to make the computers run current software.
2) Load each computer with a complete suite of software, including Microsoft Office processing programs.
3) Consult with local school and welfare officials to identify families with school aged children that do not have access to a home computer.
4) Hold free classes for those families including how to set-up, mantain and operate the systems, how to create basic documents and spreadsheets, computer safety and computer security.
5) Upon completion of training, award each participating family a complete computer system.
6) Offer participating families an assortment of continuing software and training classes to allow them to get caught-up with their peers.
This means that over 100 families will be impacted directly and significantly by this project within the next few months. If you think about it, that is a lot of positive change with very visible results.


About Us ....  Project Based Learning Inc. (PBL, a Florida Non-Profit) runs Space Coast FabLab and is part of an official chain from the MIT Center of Bits and Atoms. The use of the FabLab (Fabrication Lab) and classroom combination to create a collaborative innovation center offers a truly unique experience in education. Utilizing a project-based approach, PBL offers numerous pathways to STEM education as diverse as the population it serves.Participants working to complete a “project” see the math, science, and technology as simple steps toward a personalized goal, instead of a dry textbook or lecture.Projects are supported by classroom offerings ranging from children’s snap circuit workshops to advanced FPGA programming and family activities offering the community at large an opportunity to see, feel, and use advanced engineering tools applied to their daily lives. Each month as many as 300 new community members have visited PBL for the first time. Their ages range from 5 yrs. old to early 80s. Their backgrounds and socio-economic standings are just as diverse. The common thread is an excitement about innovation and the desire to achieve the goal of a completed project. It is our intention to expand to over 50 classes, K-12 outreach programs, and Teach-the-Teacher programs, in addition to the normal FabLab activities and family nights. It doesn’t matter what their background is, they’re learning how to find and leverage the knowledge of others and in open/free resources. Students learn to work with other people. A process allowing all levels to contribute to projects. PLB currently offers: 
-Standard machine shop with CNC machines-Video audio capabilities multiple high def. cameras and audio blenders-Laser cutters max size 4’ by 2’ cutting size, several smaller 12” laser cutters-Standard electrical benches-High end computing capabilities (Over 50 PCs)-Training rooms (3 current, 7 planned) -DoD level certifications through  pre-existing partnership -An international telecom bridge connecting to all other FabLabs in the MIT network (over 200 locations including MIT)-3D printers 
PBL currently services the community from two separate locations. Over 10,000 students attend school within 3.5 miles of our facilities.  This is combined with current and continued access to tech startup, university students, local engineers, retirees, and the community as a whole.
  How To Help
 Because we do not charge people for most equipment and facilities use, our budget is rather minimal. That said, we do have a seemingly endless supply of volunteers willing to assist with this and other worthwhile projects. Most are students, some are retirees. Others come in to use the equipment and wind up spending a lot of time on projects and then end up volunteering to help others.
We already have the initial computers, the assembly and repair people, and the volunteer teachers for the basic computer skills classes. The only unfunded  expense is to purchase the parts needed to rehabilitate the computers, software fees, and package the systems safely for their trip home.
The total cost (because we shop wisely) is estimated to be less than $100 per complete system, or approximately $96. That includes replacing some broken monitors and other more expensive pieces.
If funds raised turn out to be less than we need we believe we can come up with the difference for our own volunteers. If not we will distribute as many as we can. If it winds up being more funding than we need, we can expand the program to another 5 or 10 families.   
Other Ways You Can Help

 If you cannot contribute, you can still help!  If you live near the Space Coast please come visit us! Volunteer to help clean and assemble units. We will train you and give you free coffee. You will meet some exciting new friends and get to hang around with some really smart engineers.  Please share this project on social media. It's a good project that will be successful because it deserves to be successful. Post this project to your FaceBook page, mention it in your blog if you have one, or use the Indiegogo social media tool to get the word out. We truly appreciate your help. 

We hope this will be a long term project.
We hope to expand this program worldwide. It is a bit difficult now, because we do not have the class facilities available in other cities, and the skills training is what makes this project viable. Once we can show others our success we hope to team up with other facilities around the world and make Project Prodigy available just about everywhere.

trained in educational songwriting, and music. 
My first
music CD is featured with unique and original children’s songs and in each song
the singer or the team features the name of the child whom the CD is intended
for as a gift. 
All the way
to bed time these songs are compelling for both children and adults, and
contribute to the wonderful atmosphere of joy and family.
What I expect and what you get The main goal
is to collect 20,000 $
at the same time giving you backers the experience of featuring your child’s
name into these 7 songs already I’ve worked on. At the same time the funds will
go to cover the cost of production of 10 more children songs and I’m super
excited to listen to them with you. 

Please
note that when you order from the sing a song digital album onwards you need to
provide me your child’s name to produce the featured songs and those who are
willing to order the hard copy version should fill out the shipping details in
the delivery segment.

After my bachelor's in engineering, I took up a consulting job at Knight Frank, which largely involved consulting for large companies to set up their factories in India.Post which, I started an online jewellery venture along with my wife, with a mission to make jewellery shopping easy.
I always felt that I should be solving problems which are large and essential to the humanity.
At home, I used to see several perishable ingredients like fruits, vegetable, milk products, biscuits, confectionery products being thrown into the bin. This was largely due to non-utilisation or either it would have surpassed the expiry date.  
I started to think if i was wasting so much food at home, what would be happening at the Global level.Hence,I started to read about the food wastage that exists in the World and i was baffled !
Take a look at this:

(Source: FAO)


The food wastage does not end only with this, but also generates greenhouse gases,wastage of large amounts of natural resources like water and also an enormous amount of labour.

(Source: FAO)
This is a very serious issue and calls for us to take measures to save and consume food in more responsible way.
This calls for innovation and entrepreneurs to come up with solutions to reduce food wastage.

<p>A good friend of mine, dian marino, was fond of saying “be passionately aware that you could be completely wrong.”  This radical statement of humility about what we know has guided me infall aspects of my life, from activism, to popular education, to parenting. And 13th Century Sufi teacher Saadi of Shiraz said, “none learned the art of archery from me who, in the end, did not make me the target.” Another radical statement that guides me daily. Having spent over 30 years seeking, learning, and practicing popular education I have a few things to commit to paper. Popular education challenges our certainties and helps us work with each other to create the new certainties that we need to change our world in this dire time. I plan to complete an important book that combines knowledge of popular education with storytelling and, crucially, what i have learned from trickster traditions around the world. It is these trickster traditions that hold the missing key to our efforts to learn better, to effect better change in our lives and the world. And it is urgent that we do so.
</p><p>
</p><p>Much is made of innovation as the solution to contemporary problems. And the trickster, in teaching us how to think creatively, has obvious relevance in this. But the trickster also teaches us how to rediscover, preserve, and, possibly, reinvent old ways that are also important sources of solutions to the troubles we face - troubles that we have often created ourselves. The trickster teaches us both daring and humility. And much of this is through storytelling - something that i have developed as an important aspect of popular education.
</p><p>I have been involved in the world of popular education since the late 70s and have been privileged to be able to learn from great educators and theorists around the world. And, while i have produced many resources (articles in books, ‘zines, reports, curricula) my commitment always to be on the front-line of this work, rooted primarily in  community-based work, has made consolidating my knowledge in a book an elusive goal. I am waiting no longer. This project, “Praxis: A Trickster’s Guide to Popular Education” will bring together the key elements of popular education as i have come to see and practice them today.  </p>Popular education is a process of social change rooted in the realization that learning is a fundamental part of change. Inspired by the work of Brazilian educational philosopher Paulo Freire, I am one of thousands of people around the world who have developed and practiced popular education as a means of resisting oppression by  supporting people and communities to build capacities, often already nascent, to transform their world for the better. Combining my skills in journalism, community art, storytelling, and puppetry has allowed me to explore and develop dimensions of popular education and social change that remain both unrepresented and under-represented in the literature available to educators and activists for social change. Since 2001 i have taught a graduate class in popular education (co-taught in the first two years) at the Faculty of Environmental Studies at York University. This class, Popular Education for Social Change has been a place to hone both practice and theory, share it with hundreds of students, and amass a library of resources both theoretical and practical. I have shared my knowledge through various writing projects including working on the collection of dian marino’s writings <b>Wild Garden: art, education, and the culture of resistance</b> (Between the Lines, 1997), publishing a blog about storytelling and popular education <a href=""http://comeuppance.blogspot.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Comeuppance</a>, co-founding the <a href=""http://www.catalystcentre.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Catalyst Centre</a>, a popular education worker co-op, and more.<p> “Praxis: A Trickster’s Guide to Popular Education”  has four components:
</p><ol>
<li>Core aspects of a theory of popular education (5-6 chapters) <a href=""http://comeuppance.blogspot.ca/2015/10/theory-duende-popular-education.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">example here</a>
</li>
<li>A Collection of illustrated activity descriptions of popular education methods (between 20 and 30) <a href=""http://208.89.55.99/devel/wp-content/uploads/murals.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">example here</a>
</li>

</li>
<li>A collection of Wisdom Tales (30-40) - <a href=""http://comeuppance.blogspot.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">examples here</a>
</li>
</ol><p>A key dimension of popular education is the way in which it combines theory and practice. But articulating this (in print and otherwise) is a significant challenge given the dominant practices of knowledge-making which take for granted that theory and practice can be separated. My practice or, more accurately, praxis, has always combined a vigorous interest in theory and a rigorous application of various methods in contexts of learning and social change. As a student of Paulo Freire’s work, i took to heart a long time ago this challenge to realize this praxis (this combining of theory and practice). This book will share my successes as well as examples of what i have researched from around the world.
</p><p>Finally, i believe one of my most powerful realizations about popular education has to do with the nature of play and playfulness - thus my use of the term “trickster” which combines notions of play and risk. Popular education praxis recognizes that being playful is more than mere fun - it is a radical obligation. This is not about play as frivolity and amusement but play as structured risk-taking that includes the way all children learn the fundamentals of participation in human culture - we’ve all been through it and yet, so much of our upbringing and education then becomes about avoiding risk. The trickster, a figure found universally in human cultures, is the neglected teacher of how to meet and engage risk.
</p><p>One of my favourite trickster stories, and a key inspiration for this project is:
</p><p><i>One day a devoted Talmudic student ran out of the synagogue shouting, “What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life?” He ran through the streets shouting all the while. He found himself before the house of his Rabbi. He went inside and, almost in tears, pleaded, “What is the meaning of life, master?” The rabbi slapped the student across the face. “Why did you hit me,” asked the startled student. The rabbi answered: “Such a good question. And you want to exchange it for an answer? It is the answers that keep us apart. It is the questions that unite us!”</i></p><p>(You'll find 8 short pieces of me waxing on about stories at the <a href=""http://biologyofstory.com/#/main?entity=chris-cavanagh"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Biology of Story</a>.) </p><p>This will be a book about the posing of questions. The chapters on theory, the activity descriptions, the stories … all these will be tools with which to pose the unique questions relevant to those readers who wish to improve their practice. My goal is to help people and communities see what they already have and what they are already doing that is making a positive difference in the world and to offer more choices about what can be done. Not only “tricks of the trade,” as important as these are (and there will be lots of these), my goal is to fan the flames of creativity found in all people and communities so that together we will bring into existence the “better possible world” heralded by activists for environmental and social justice around the world.
</p><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p><p>My budget for this project is simple, i am seeking to pay for my time to write. My expenses are two-fold, rent and groceries. As important as this book is, my priority is the care and well-being of my two children. They are the most demanding and rewarding events in my life. But being separated, i have been a virtual single parent (having been the primary care giver for over two years now) and the one thing i do not have is time to write. Thus this project campaign. My $20,000 goal will allow me to devote the equivalent of half my work time to this project for which i am to have a  completed manuscript by January 2017. Fulfilling the perks will cost about 15% of the money raised.
</p><p>The rewards i am offering for the support you may offer are a combination of the art work and writing (‘zines and artist books) that i have produced in my work of popular education, the finished book itself, of course, and, for those who donate $1000 or more, a popular education fluxus box (a vintage suitcase filled with ‘zines, art supplies, games, and more - all of which can be used in work with groups - it’s a group facilitator’s tickle trunk). 
</p><p><b>Risks and Challenges</b></p><p>This is a low risk project. I will use whatever funds are raised regardless of meeting the target. Success will mean completing the book on schedule. Failing to meet the target means slower progress, but progress nonetheless. I have completed more funded projects in my career as a popular educator than I can count.
</p><p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p><p>If contributing financially is a challenge then please consider helping to spread the word about this campaign. A good word sent our to your networks can be a huge assist. Indiegogo has tools for sharing - check them out. And, of course, keep your ear to the ground for the release of the book in the not-too-distant future. </p><p></p></div>","A good friend of mine, dian marino, was fond of saying “be passionately aware that you could be completely wrong.”  This radical statement of humility about what we know has guided me infall aspects of my life, from activism, to popular education, to parenting.

Not only “tricks of the trade,” as important as these are (and there will be lots of these), my goal is to fan the flames of creativity found in all people and communities so that together we will bring into existence the “better possible world” heralded by activists for environmental and social justice around the world.
What We Need & What You GetMy budget for this project is simple, i am seeking to pay for my time to write. My expenses are two-fold, rent and groceries. As important as this book is, my priority is the care and well-being of my two children. They are the most demanding and rewarding events in my life. But being separated, i have been a virtual single parent (having been the primary care giver for over two years now) and the one thing i do not have is time to write. Thus this project campaign. My $20,000 goal will allow me to devote the equivalent of half my work time to this project for which i am to have a  completed manuscript by January 2017. Fulfilling the perks will cost about 15% of the money raised.
The rewards i am offering for the support you may offer are a combination of the art work and writing (‘zines and artist books) that i have produced in my work of popular education, the finished book itself, of course, and, for those who donate $1000 or more, a popular education fluxus box (a vintage suitcase filled with ‘zines, art supplies, games, and more - all of which can be used in work with groups - it’s a group facilitator’s tickle trunk). 
Risks and ChallengesThis is a low risk project. I will use whatever funds are raised regardless of meeting the target. Success will mean completing the book on schedule. Failing to meet the target means slower progress, but progress nonetheless. I have completed more funded projects in my career as a popular educator than I can count.
Other Ways You Can HelpIf contributing financially is a challenge then please consider helping to spread the word about this campaign. A good word sent our to your networks can be a huge assist. Indiegogo has tools for sharing - check them out. And, of course, keep your ear to the ground for the release of the book in the not-too-distant future.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Please take the time to meet Honey Beehive Childcare's owners Candace Robinson and Ja'Lisa Wilkins.  </p>
<p>My name is Candace Robinson, I am the mother of two young children and an experienced early childhood educator.  After spending 6 years working in multiple childcare centers and a home daycare, I began to seek the best fit for me.  With the suggestions of many family and friends, I realized the best fit was my own facility.</p>
<p>My Name is Ja'Lisa Wilkins, I am also an experienced childcare educator. I've been working with children since 2008 whether it was in a daycare to a school setting I've done it all. I've always had a dream of becoming my own boss while pursuing my passion to work with children as well. So why not put those two together by starting my own daycare! See when I was younger I did not enjoy daycare at all! Teachers weren't as attentive and at times unfair but hey that could have been just been the POV of my 5 year old self! What I really do remember is my Aunt Macy coming to pick me up and we had the best times together. She taught me so much from manners to how to stand up for myself and be bold, she taught me how to treat others the way I would like to be treated, be respectful to my elders and that we all make mistakes you just pick yourself up and learn from them. All while having fun in the process of these lessons. <br/> </p>
<p>To pursue this passion, we partnered together and started Honey Beehive babysitting service in  Candace's home to build clientele.  The overwhelming support and demand for a trusted  affordable care flourished quicker than we anticipated requiring  additional funds for expansion, assistance, and equipment .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are eager to provide parents with cutting edge childcare without the costly price tag.</p>
<p>Quality affordable care that supplies:</p>

<li>Early learning materials  for all ages that exercise all  5 senses, discovery &amp; individuality</li>

Selfhelp.org reports the cost of educational supplies to total up to $4,100 and averaged the total start up cost for a new facility to be$ 83,030.

of $12,000, we will buy novels for grades KG-12, build our school library, and
expand our book collection to meet the needs of our growing student
body, who read books faster than we can get them!</p>
<p><b>Our School</b></p>
<p>The American International School in Gaza
(AISG). AISG is the only international school in Gaza that teaches the American
curriculum and it strives to promote an understanding and appreciation of the
world's diverse cultures. We are an independent, co-educational K-12 school,
which offers an American curriculum leading to the American High School
Diploma. Our education philosophy emphasizes academic excellence and rigor in a
supportive school and family environment. We aim to prepare a diverse student
body for higher education; to inspire our youth to realize their potential; to
foster life-long learning, tolerance, peace, personal integrity, and democratic
values; and to prepare our students to become responsible adults, with respect
for different cultures and beliefs. AISG graduates are currently pursuing their
university studies in the most reputable universities in the Middle East,
Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Despite the tragedy of the school facilities
destruction on January 3, 2009, AISG is still committed and continued providing
quality educational services to its students. </p>
<p>AISG offers an ideal avenue for serving the
international’s community goals for Gaza and investing in the future of Gaza
and its people.  The realization of the
school’s vision as a US-accredited school providing a high quality American and
international education to children in Gaza would have a tremendous impact on
Gaza’s economic and cultural development, and will be able to be a force for
peace and sustainability in the middle east through nonviolent means and
principals of tolerance and coexistence. </p>
<p>In spite of political, economic, and security
situations that are unimaginable to the vast majority of international schools
in the world, AISG has already shown glimpses of its true potential during the
course of its 16-year existence.  Many of
its graduates have gone on to success at colleges and universities in the United
States, the Middle East, and elsewhere, and have brought their learning home to
benefit their community.  If allowed to
progress and thrive through the current hard times in the middle east area in
general in Gaza strip in particular, it will serve as a building block for the
development of a strong local economy, producing graduates with the tools and
skills to contribute to Gaza’s economic growth.  </p><p>Though we are a private school, we are also a non-profit organization.
Student tuition covers only the basic operating costs of our organization.<br/></p>
<p>Contemporary American and international
education, with its emphasis on critical thinking, free inquiry, and
internationalism, can help guide Gaza’s cultural life in a positive and
constructive direction and enable the youth of Gaza to build bridges with their
counterparts in the United States and elsewhere.</p>
<p><b>Our Project</b></p>
<p>Gaza is a large, but extremely isolated city. Access
to school level English literature is limited. For many of our students, making
the trip to a the public library is simply not an option that will give them
any English literature Novels. Therefore, our school is the only place these
students can obtain books in English. We feel that it is our duty to make more
books available.</p>
<p>Our project goal of $12,000 will be used to buy
classroom sets of novels for grades K-12, as well as to meet the needs of our
growing school library and expand our book collection.</p>
<p>The classroom sets that we will purchase include the
majority of the books that our students will use in elementary school, middle
school, as well as those that they will need for the next four years of high
school and the SAT program. These books are integrated into our curriculum and
will help us achieve our standards for literature and language arts. The
list of books includes (but is not limited to) </p>
<p>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, Holes, Stone
Fox, Tuck Everlasting, Music of the Blue Dolphins, And Then There Were None,
Fever 1793, The Bad Beginning, Catch-22, Death of a Salesman, House on Mango
Street, The Red Badge of Courage, Frankenstein, Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,
and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime.</p>
<p>We will be purchasing the books in bulk from The
Reading Warehouse, and shipping them (for free!) to a U.S. location. We will
then ship them to the Gaza (via Israel). The customs fees and taxes, as well as
the shipping costs, are calculated into our goal.</p>
<p>In the event that we do not reach our goal we will
purchase as many classroom sets as funding allows, focusing on our immediate
needs for the rest of this year. Any amount that you can contribute will go
towards getting us these books, and we thank you in advance for your help!</p>
<p>For more detailed information about our book lists or
projected costs, please email us at: m.owdaa@aisg.ps</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Taking the opportunity to donate a book to any child
is a valuable thing. However, by donating to this campaign you are putting
English reading material in the hands of a student who would not otherwise be
able to find it.</p>
<p>These books will be invaluable to us as our school
moves forward. These classroom sets will be used year after year, and will
continually challenge and advance our students' learning. With your one-time
donation, you will be part of a library legacy within Pioneers Baccalaureate
School.</p>
<p>Please check out our ""perks"" (located on the
right), and get on board!</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>We understand that not everyone is in a position to
donate at this time. We would also fully appreciate your help in spreading the
word about our school and our project. By sharing our story with people that
you know can help, you are doing us a wonderful service. Thank you!</p></div>","With our goal

values; and to prepare our students to become responsible adults, with respect
for different cultures and beliefs. AISG graduates are currently pursuing their
university studies in the most reputable universities in the Middle East,
Europe and North America.
Despite the tragedy of the school facilities
destruction on January 3, 2009, AISG is still committed and continued providing
quality educational services to its students. 
AISG offers an ideal avenue for serving the
international’s community goals for Gaza and investing in the future of Gaza
and its people.  The realization of the
school’s vision as a US-accredited school providing a high quality American and
international education to children in Gaza would have a tremendous impact on
Gaza’s economic and cultural development, and will be able to be a force for
peace and sustainability in the middle east through nonviolent means and
principals of tolerance and coexistence. 
In spite of political, economic, and security
situations that are unimaginable to the vast majority of international schools
in the world, AISG has already shown glimpses of its true potential during the
course of its 16-year existence.  Many of
its graduates have gone on to success at colleges and universities in the United
States, the Middle East, and elsewhere, and have brought their learning home to
benefit their community.  If allowed to
progress and thrive through the current hard times in the middle east area in
general in Gaza strip in particular, it will serve as a building block for the
development of a strong local economy, producing graduates with the tools and
skills to contribute to Gaza’s economic growth.  Though we are a private school, we are also a non-profit organization.
Student tuition covers only the basic operating costs of our organization.
Contemporary American and international
education, with its emphasis on critical thinking, free inquiry, and
internationalism, can help guide Gaza’s cultural life in a positive and
constructive direction and enable the youth of Gaza to build bridges with their
counterparts in the United States and elsewhere.
Our Project
Gaza is a large, but extremely isolated city. Access
to school level English literature is limited. For many of our students, making
the trip to a the public library is simply not an option that will give them
any English literature Novels. Therefore, our school is the only place these
students can obtain books in English. We feel that it is our duty to make more
books available.
Our project goal of $12,000 will be used to buy
classroom sets of novels for grades K-12, as well as to meet the needs of our
growing school library and expand our book collection.
The classroom sets that we will purchase include the
majority of the books that our students will use in elementary school, middle
school, as well as those that they will need for the next four years of high
school and the SAT program. These books are integrated into our curriculum and
will help us achieve our standards for literature and language arts. The
list of books includes (but is not limited to) 
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, Holes, Stone
Fox, Tuck Everlasting, Music of the Blue Dolphins, And Then There Were None,
Fever 1793, The Bad Beginning, Catch-22, Death of a Salesman, House on Mango
Street, The Red Badge of Courage, Frankenstein, Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,
and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime.
We will be purchasing the books in bulk from The
Reading Warehouse, and shipping them (for free!) to a U.S. location. We will
then ship them to the Gaza (via Israel). The customs fees and taxes, as well as
the shipping costs, are calculated into our goal.
In the event that we do not reach our goal we will
purchase as many classroom sets as funding allows, focusing on our immediate
needs for the rest of this year. Any amount that you can contribute will go
towards getting us these books, and we thank you in advance for your help!
For more detailed information about our book lists or
projected costs, please email us at: m.owdaa@aisg.ps
The Impact
Taking the opportunity to donate a book to any child
is a valuable thing. However, by donating to this campaign you are putting
English reading material in the hands of a student who would not otherwise be
able to find it.
These books will be invaluable to us as our school
moves forward. These classroom sets will be used year after year, and will
continually challenge and advance our students' learning. With your one-time
donation, you will be part of a library legacy within Pioneers Baccalaureate
School.
Please check out our ""perks"" (located on the
right), and get on board!
Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that not everyone is in a position to
donate at this time. We would also fully appreciate your help in spreading the
word about our school and our project. By sharing our story with people that
you know can help, you are doing us a wonderful service. Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Plus, they will never forget to bring it!!</p>
<p>Also, included in GraphLock is a classroom monitoring system allowing <b>teachers </b>to start and stop the lockdown mode all at the same time. So the teacher can simply set the lockdown for the length of the class and once it is over, all students have their phones back as soon as the timer goes off! How awesome is that?!</p>
<p>GraphLock was created by a teacher for a teacher.  The app is simple, effective, and useful. </p>
<p><b>Parents</b> save money by purchasing a $5 app (no batteries needed) instead of a $100 calculator!  Also, there is a parent version where parents can use the lockdown feature by putting their children's phone on “lockdown” allowing only the calculator to work; no texts, Snapchats, or Facebook!  This takes ""homework time"" to a whole new level and helps keep students focused. Fabulous!</p>
<p><b>Students</b> have peace of mind because they can accomplish their academic goals by having the necessary tools for their mathematics/engineering classes all for the price of a cup of coffee! Plus they will be able to use the same calculator at home, in class and on exams from high school through college. And, they will never forget their calculator because it is right on their device!</p>
<p><b>Funds, Funds, Funds</b></p>
<p>The funds from this campaign will go directly towards: free downloads to low income students, marketing, and training. Our goal is to raise $25,000 to help over 5,000 students.  Our marketing is going to run through social media outlets and conferences to reach out to more schools and teachers. While our training is going to be online and on-site.  Any school that has over 650 downloads will receive on-site training from Co-Founder &amp; CEO - Mallory Dyer.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>With every new endeavor comes risks and challenges.  While we cannot change the educational system overnight or the tools we use.  Or can we?  One of our biggest challenges will be getting the College Board &amp; ACT to allow this as another accepted tool to use during examinations.  While we understand the importance of these exams and know the critical role they play in students’ futures, we are quite confident they will adopt GraphLock as an acceptable option.</p>

Parents save money by purchasing a $5 app (no batteries needed) instead of a $100 calculator!  Also, there is a parent version where parents can use the lockdown feature by putting their children's phone on “lockdown” allowing only the calculator to work; no texts, Snapchats, or Facebook!  This takes ""homework time"" to a whole new level and helps keep students focused. Fabulous!
Students have peace of mind because they can accomplish their academic goals by having the necessary tools for their mathematics/engineering classes all for the price of a cup of coffee! Plus they will be able to use the same calculator at home, in class and on exams from high school through college. And, they will never forget their calculator because it is right on their device!
Funds, Funds, Funds
The funds from this campaign will go directly towards: free downloads to low income students, marketing, and training. Our goal is to raise $25,000 to help over 5,000 students.  Our marketing is going to run through social media outlets and conferences to reach out to more schools and teachers. While our training is going to be online and on-site.  Any school that has over 650 downloads will receive on-site training from Co-Founder & CEO - Mallory Dyer.
Risks & Challenges
With every new endeavor comes risks and challenges.  While we cannot change the educational system overnight or the tools we use.  Or can we?  One of our biggest challenges will be getting the College Board & ACT to allow this as another accepted tool to use during examinations.  While we understand the importance of these exams and know the critical role they play in students’ futures, we are quite confident they will adopt GraphLock as an acceptable option.
Meet Team GraphLock!

With the effect of social media, children rarely find the fun in picking up a book to read to better their reading skills. In the Writers' Room, children ages 8 and up are able to come up with their own story idea, and with the mentoring of Writers' Room staff, they will help each child develop their own story, help them with the critical thinking, guide them through researching their idea, and help them develop the story to eventually turn into a book. </p>
<p>The beauty of this creative learning is that the children will have ownership of this project and they will want to read more as they continue to write more. The children will have access to computers, resource materials, Award winning Authors, and the design center where we will house designing programs like Photoshop where they can illustrate their own characters. </p>
<p>As the children continue to frequent The Writers' Room, they will eventually complete their book and with the assistance of staff, they will have a physical book in hand to show their completion, becoming a ""Tiny Author"".</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>THE ADULTS: </b>If you ever thought to yourself, ""I want to write a book but I don't know how."" The Writers' Room is for you too! When I became an author, I didn't know the first steps on how to do anything. I just knew I had an idea that I needed to get on paper and the rest I had to figure out on my own. With The Writers' Room, look no more, we've got you covered! Our staff will guide you through the entire process from helping you with your story idea, to help develop your story, to helping with your chapter layout, etc. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">All the resources that the children has, you will have that as well. Access to the printing stations, computers, and design labs, you will walk out of The Writers' Room with a completed novel, picture book, magazine, or even a cook book. Anything that needs to be designed, you will have access to the resources and equipment to become the author you have dreamed of.</span></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I hear all the time, ""I want to write my own book but I don't have the resources, the equipment, or thinking space to do this. When I'm at home, I'm bothered by my family where I can't think."" </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">OR </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">""My little brother keeps knocking at my door annoying me, I can't think!"" </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>The Writers' Room will solve all the problems so we will need the following:</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Computers, Computers, COMPUTERS! Without computers, the patrons won't have access to the internet for research, and they will not have a platform to type up their stories.</li>
<li>Printers/ Xerox. Once the book has been completed, you need a few pair of eyes to read over the story and edit it. Printers are key to this!</li>
<li>Computer Software. Writing is one thing but without artwork, you just have words on a page.</li>
<li>Supplies. Paper, Pens, Pencils, Notepads, Sticky notes, cleaning supplies, toiletries for the restroom, </li>
<li>Furniture (Tables, Stools, Chairs). It's fun to sit on a ground but if you're as creative as I am, I'm all over the place while writing. I'm on the floor, laying on the sofa, sitting at a desk, or relaxing on a bean bag to get into my creative zone.</li>
<li>Television. What's a reception area without a TV?</li>
<li>Security System. It's probably a good idea to protect the equipment.</li>
</ul>

</div><div><br/></div><div>- The Writers' Room</div></div>","About the Writers' Room THE CHILDREN: Literacy is important for our children. With the effect of social media, children rarely find the fun in picking up a book to read to better their reading skills. In the Writers' Room, children ages 8 and up are able to come up with their own story idea, and with the mentoring of Writers' Room staff, they will help each child develop their own story, help them with the critical thinking, guide them through researching their idea, and help them develop the story to eventually turn into a book. 
The beauty of this creative learning is that the children will have ownership of this project and they will want to read more as they continue to write more. The children will have access to computers, resource materials, Award winning Authors, and the design center where we will house designing programs like Photoshop where they can illustrate their own characters. 
As the children continue to frequent The Writers' Room, they will eventually complete their book and with the assistance of staff, they will have a physical book in hand to show their completion, becoming a ""Tiny Author"".
THE ADULTS: If you ever thought to yourself, ""I want to write a book but I don't know how."" The Writers' Room is for you too! When I became an author, I didn't know the first steps on how to do anything. I just knew I had an idea that I needed to get on paper and the rest I had to figure out on my own. With The Writers' Room, look no more, we've got you covered! Our staff will guide you through the entire process from helping you with your story idea, to help develop your story, to helping with your chapter layout, etc. 
All the resources that the children has, you will have that as well. Access to the printing stations, computers, and design labs, you will walk out of The Writers' Room with a completed novel, picture book, magazine, or even a cook book. Anything that needs to be designed, you will have access to the resources and equipment to become the author you have dreamed of.   What We Need & What You Get
I hear all the time, ""I want to write my own book but I don't have the resources, the equipment, or thinking space to do this. When I'm at home, I'm bothered by my family where I can't think."" 
OR 
""My little brother keeps knocking at my door annoying me, I can't think!"" 
The Writers' Room will solve all the problems so we will need the following:

Computers, Computers, COMPUTERS! Without computers, the patrons won't have access to the internet for research, and they will not have a platform to type up their stories.
Printers/ Xerox. Once the book has been completed, you need a few pair of eyes to read over the story and edit it. Printers are key to this!
Computer Software. Writing is one thing but without artwork, you just have words on a page.
Supplies. Paper, Pens, Pencils, Notepads, Sticky notes, cleaning supplies, toiletries for the restroom, 
Furniture (Tables, Stools, Chairs). It's fun to sit on a ground but if you're as creative as I am, I'm all over the place while writing. I'm on the floor, laying on the sofa, sitting at a desk, or relaxing on a bean bag to get into my creative zone.
Television. What's a reception area without a TV?
Security System. It's probably a good idea to protect the equipment.

What Happens if I don't reach my goal?
 Simple. The Writers' Room will still be open. Although we may not have everything we need to service the community, I strongly believe in ""if you build it, it will come.""     The Impact There are things in life that WE want to do as humans, then there are things in life that you are lead to do... This is called your purpose. 
My purpose is to make a huge impact in my community by making reading and writing fun again.

We bought land! It's time to build our women's center!





Tiwale, which means ""let us shine/glow"" in Chichewa, was set up as a youth-led community based organization to empower Malawian women by providing economic opportunities through leadership workshops, micro-finance loans, vocational skills training, and education grants. To grow our efforts at providing economic opportunities for Malawian women, Tiwale has acquired a plot of land to construct an education center. This center will provide secondary school education classes and further vocational skills training for the women of Ntsiriza Community, Malawi






Our goal is to construct a space for education and entrepreneurship for women in Malawi. In the past, we have given school grants for women to return to school, however, two challenges were reported:
Challenge 1: The schools were located in faraway communities and so participants could not afford or spare the time for the commute.
Challenge 2: Their classmates in the schools were younger children which was embarrassing and discouraging. 



The education center will be a safe growing space for women of all ages who were forced to leave school early due to varied circumstances. 









Tiwale will hire teachers to provide daily evening classes at a feasible time for a majority of the women in Ntsiriza Community. 





The classes will vary ranging from the sciences, humanities, languages and the arts to aid the women of Ntsiriza community in attaining the Malawi Secondary Certificate of Education (MSCE).







September 2015:
Purchased a plot for the construction of education center
September 2015:
Cost calculations and team building
March-May 2016: Fundraising and sells of vocational skills training products
June 2016:
Commence construction of our education center
October-November 2016:
Curriculum buildings, project planning finalizing library and computer lab.
January 2017:
Launch classes!!






This is a break down for the budget for the full completion of the center, which includes a classroom, refuge home, an office space, community store, and operations for our first two years will total up to around US$20,000.




This is the floor plan for the future education center! We are really excited to see it get built this summer and for the future women who will get to utilize this center. 




Malawi is the world’s poorest country by per capita GDP. According to the International Fund for Agricultural Development, 74% of the Malawian population lives below the income poverty line of US$1.25 a day.




 Most families cannot afford to finance their children’s education which can cost up to 30$ or more annually. Only 33% of the total amount of secondary aged students who should be enrolled in secondary school education is attending school. From this 33%, only 42% are girls. Most girls marry early in exchange for dowry; payment from the husband’s family.



With the infrequency of social mobility in Malawi, daughters and her daughter’s daughter often face the same fate: early marriage and insufficient schooling. Over time this vicious cycle has created a substantial population of women who are under-educated, jobless and facing extreme poverty.








To date, Tiwale has grown to training over 150 women in the business education programs, guiding 40 women to start businesses via micro-loans and another 30 women undergoing a vocational skills training program. 


The goal has been to promote the education of women and so with selling of fabrics made in the training program, Tiwale secured US$2,500 to purchase a plot of land to build an education center. 


With this space, we will provide secondary school education classes and further vocational skills development for the women in Ntsiriza community.




The Tiwale Team
Tiwale is youth-led community based organization. Our team members volunteer their services. We are all driven by a strong thirst to realize our vision of an innovative, empowered generation of Malawian women.

(ελληνικά παρακάτω)Introduction - Involvement in volunteering so farHello! My name is Giannis and I am a 24 years old Mathematics graduate based in Thessaloniki, Greece.Last summer I was fortunate enough to travel to Accra, Ghanafor a volunteer experience with Dream Africa Care Foundation. This short period of time was enough to change my perspectivesfor life and set new goals, not only involving my raised awareness on humanitarian situation in underdeveloped countries, but also the willingness to dedicate myself on a professional level to more anthropocentric areas of studies.I tried my best to help my elementary students understand maths and improve their English by adopting a game-like joyful way of teaching, which not only proved to raise the kids' interest but improved my skills a lot, as well. Have a little insight through my scope:Having gained this experience, I developed big aspirations for wanting to assist more children in a developing community and gain knowledge, which will hopefully prove valuable for my future occupations as a scientist in the social sector. 

Current mission
Being aware of the existence of many scam organizations in developing countries and after months of conducting research aimed to avoiding being a victim of such situation, sending mails and asking for personal experiences from former volunteers of low-cost organizations, I finally decided to volunteer with the CIVS; a low-cost, non-profit, community development agency operating especially in the marginalized and poverty-stricken rural areas of Kenya. The duration of my mission trip is going to be at least one month, beginning in June. I will be hosted by a local Kenyan family, and my work, depending on my placement, will mainly include assistance at a local school and possibly environmental conservation and HIV/Aids awareness raise. I am also willing to bring an extra suitcase full of clothes and books (which I will gather the following months) for the community alongside my personal luggage. For more information about CIVS you can check here: http://www.civskenya.com

<p>By viewing our timeline
towards the end of the campaign you will observe that it took us 40 years of
hard work to make this dream a reality. The last 11 years we have extensively
informed the scientific community of the new achievements we have invented in
magnetism. Throughout these 11 years of informing the experts, teachers and the
professors of physics and magnetism, we have received a truly positive feedback
from them. They have strongly encouraged us to make these new findings in
magnetism available to the experts but also make them available especially to
our young people so it becomes part of their education.  We greatly believe in the young
minds and trust in them that they, together with their educators, will embrace
with enthusiasm and inventiveness the new scientific findings in magnetism.</p>

<p>This scientific knowledge that
is derived from the invention's formation of its technology is what we would
like to share with you and deliver it to you in the best possible manner,
realizing with responsibility, that you can only presently obtain this
scientific knowledge from us, since it is not available anywhere else in the
bibliography as well as in the commercialization of magnetism. With a great sense of this responsibility we have
created all the product members offered in this campaign.  We would like
to share with you our work in this exciting scientific journey and make you
also an important part of this journey's rewarding dream, so we really mean in practice our
phrase:<b> ""join us in spirit in this scientifically

Specifically, in February 18, 2013 the inventor was invited by the top magnetic scientists of the European Organization for Nuclear Research ""CERN"" to demonstrate experimentally to them, the achievements of the invention at the Geneva laboratories. This invitation came after the demonstration given by the inventor to top scientists of the National Center for Scientific Research (N.C.S.R.) on Jan. 16, 2013, invited by Dr. Michele Barone. Without revealing the technology itself, since it was not published as yet by the Greek patent office O.B.I., the inventor demonstrated in detail to the ""CERN"" scientists the achievements of the invention completing all the experiments, as these are also performed by the two types of experimental devices offered here.</p>
<p><b>A great thanks and appreciation to Dr. Michele Barone and the scientists of CERN,</b> for their kindness to support us and invite us to exhibit, demonstrate and present the invention at CERN in Geneva and also at Demokritos Nuclear Laboratory in the event CERN-GREECE INDUSTRY DAY, on March 31, 2014.</p>
<p>Many other scientific demonstrations of the invention's achievements have been performed, informing internationally the scientists, physicists, professors, engineers and organizations as well as private companies of the achievements of the invention in magnetism, through seminars, presentations, B2B meetings etc.</p>

<h3>Have the 16 magnetic interactions of the invention become part of the educational bibliographical material of the scientific society?</h3>
<p><b>No. Not as yet,</b> because these are so new, as the world patent examiners confirm and also the patent grants confirm it; all the theoretical scientific knowledge that the invention delivers and provides is not knowledge existing in the state of the art. <b>The international bibliography of physics and science does not include, cover or explain in any way the constructional behavior of how one can obtain the achievements of the invention construction wise and make the interactions happen in reality.</b> </p>

<p><b>Many different constructions of prototype permanent
magnet symmetries of  magnetic
constructions, ready to be manufactured as consumer products.</b></p></span><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><br/></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What are the materials used for the construction of the magnetic devices?</h3>
<p>The <b>magnetic constructions</b> of the magnetic devices are <b>handmade fine-tuned and calibrated and the magnets are sealed and covered completely with balsa wood. </b>The guide is constructed from finest recyclable MDF with glued parts, no nails, metal or plastic used at all. The compass elevator is all wooden construction. <br/></p>
<p><b>Neodymium licensed magnets are used:</b></p>
<p><b>The standard permanent magnets </b>used in the magnetic constructions <b>are licensed Neodymium,</b> which are the strongest of their type but they have the property that in a very small distance away from them, they lose their strength considerably in regard to other types. The neodymium permanent magnets provide the strongest possible interactions to occur in the experiments between the confronted magnetic constructions. <br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How are the magnetic constructions built and how do they provide absolute 100% safety for the user?</h3>
<p>The magnets are strongly glued on two or three thin plastic surfaces and afterwards the whole assembly is well glued, sealed and covered with fully recyclable balsa wood. The magnetic constructions as products are offered to the consumer coated with balsa as shown on the <b>pitch video</b> and the <b>""5+5=10 interactions"" video </b>and as shown above in the photos and videos of the product members as perks. They will not be offered as the above 2 videos show all the prototypes, which they have the magnets exposed in the symmetries of the magnetic constructions. These are prototypes and we want as prototypes to be able to see the arrangement of each symmetry, but these are not the finished product. The finished products have all the magnets fully sealed, protected and covered with balsa for safety reasons and the user never touches any magnet but only the balsa wood, which covers the magnets. The nickel coating on the magnets in some cases is reported to be possibly responsible for skin allergies and in this manner this probability is avoided since the user never comes in contact with any magnet. Of course, in the instructions of the products the inside symmetries and arrangements of the magnets are fully described and explained to the user.</p>
<p>Therefore, each magnetic device with its constructions is absolutely 100% safe, also with no chance whatsoever of a magnet flying out and injuring possibly the user. <br/></p>

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What are some examples of products that can be manufactured utilizing the interactions of the invention?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Below are some indicative
examples of the potential applications that can be manufactured by some of the
industrial sectors if the invention is utilized:</strong></p>
<p>1) The <b>""ATTRACTIVE NO CONTACT""</b>
interaction, where one ""magnetic construction"" attracts the other
with a complete air gap between them, gives the possibility of an application so
that a train engine - real size or toy or robot size - can be connected with the wagon and each wagon with the
next wagon, possessing a complete air gap in-between, with magnets/electromagnets positioned according to the innovation's technology. </p>
<p>2) Another case is the opposite
application in regard to the first above, where a repulsive interaction of the magnetic constructions occurs at the greater distances and when
these come closer appears a strong attractive force joining the magnetic
constructions. This case can have multiple applications in lifting machines
and cranes, industrial machinery applications, automotive industry, space technology, in nanotechnology and robotics.</p>
<p>3) From the first example is created the
<b>“STABLE BALANCE”</b> interaction and from the second example is created the
<b>“UNSTABLE BALANCE”</b> both of them producing the simultaneous co-existence of the
homogeneous and heterogeneous fields causing immobility of the bodies. These
fields of <b>""BALANCE PRODUCTION"" </b>can be used in static and kinetic constructional applications giving the
possibility of new assemblies.</p>
<p>4) From the five interactions technology is produced
the <b>""INTERLOCKING NO CONTACT""</b> interaction, having as a result the two confronted  bodies to function as one without however touching and without exerting any
repulsive or attractive force to each other. This technology is beneficial for
the non-touch magnetic power transmission constructions transmitting motion from an
energetic to a pathetic spindle-shaft achieving 100% non-friction involvement
and can be used in the manufacturing of non-touch bearings, gears, couplings
and multiple assemblies of power transmission. Also prosthetic members in
humans can be built with this technology having an extremely low coefficient of
friction between the member joints.</p>

This is our initial funding goal and it is flexible because we will be able to fulfill all our perk obligations, independently of the reached goal and that is our promise and guarantee to the community in regard to the integrity of our campaign offers. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>The delivery of the perks:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>The perks regarding the three books will be ready for delivery in September 2016 and all the perks regarding the magnetic devices and its members will be ready for delivery in October 2016  (please view timeline's last table).<br/></b></p>
<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">What happens if the initial funding goal is over-passed?<br/>
</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If the initial funding goal is over-passed we will be able to initialize our stretch goals (please view below text on stretch goals) in regard to the <b>creation of the open source interactive platform</b> and also offer some surprise perks in regard to manufacturing more needed by you arrangements of symmetries for the magnetic constructions. <br/></p>

<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">What are the
stretch goals of the open source interactive platform?</b>
</h3>
<p><b>3)</b> <b>The third product of the campaign is our offer to the community to build together with the community an open source interactive platform </b>and will be programmed by us in the stretch goals in the very specific stages of creation. The stretch goals then will include what
we would like to offer as scientific knowledge of the technology to everyone in
the community, allowing each and every one to become a member of this open source interactive platform. It will possess as a subject the whole scientific data of the
“Magnetic system of multiple interactions” in its design, creation and
development. </p>
<b>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<b>What will be our contribution </b><b>and supply to this open source interactive platform?</b>
</h3></b><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>              We will create the open source interactive platform with
all needed material and human personnel to support it, also, supply the source code
which will have the core aspects of all the details covering the whole new scientific aspect of the invention. Also,
we will work extensively and continuously for informing in the best way
possible the platform with the innermost scientific details involved in this
new magnetic technology enriching all the new design and construction
possibilities that arise. The enlisted members of the platform will be able to
enrich the code with their own knowledge, ideas and developments and have a
chance to interact with the designing of the platform’s data and designing
capabilities. <br/></p>
<p><b>Graphics, animation, forums and magnetic interactions in real time:</b><br/></p>
<p>               The platform will possess capabilities in graphics enriched by scientific data of each different case, animations of interactions in real time, including all the cases of the invention and all its accomplished interactions. Forums will be built according to the subjects concerning the
needs of the members and groups will be able to form and work on specific
projects, whether scientific, technological or theoretical.</p>
<p><b>Magnetic database, public domain and private sector involvement:</b><br/></p>
<p>     Also, this open platform
will become an important bibliographical magnetic/electromagnetic database for
organizations, universities, colleges, libraries and also interested companies,
since there will be the possibility of sharing the knowledge with each member
in the community. This will give ignition to many other initiatives that will
occur since the world of open share especially in valuable knowledge subjects
is very fast growing and is also becoming very valuable in the public domain but also in the private sector. The educational process and delivery of scientific and technological information of the platform will be extremely valuable, since this technology is very far ahead of the current bibliographical knowledge
and the platform will enable all educators and students to not only expand their know-how capabilities but also effectively use the
new magnetic findings and possibilities. <br/></p>
<p><b>Open architecture scientific know-how of the ""core technology"":</b><br/></p>
<p>We are offering an open-architecture technology; we keep all rights reserved for the inventive intellectual and industrial patented scale of the technology and all copyrights for the intellectual inventiveness of the scientific work and scientific findings. However, everything else that does not involve patents and copyrights, we offer it as an open-architecture platform able to incorporate an endless number of magnetic and electromagnetic products that will use the science and technology of the invention as a ""core technology"".</p>
<p>Your support is very important for creating this open source interactive platform and that is the reason we have placed it in this campaign as a need that will be funded by the stretch goals.</p>

<p><b></b></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></b></h3>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">The invention took 24 years of extremely hard work to become a
reality. It took another 12 years in R&amp;D to be refined in all its aspects
and details, to be complete in every aspect, theoretical, technological and
scientific wise. To possess hundreds of prototype symmetries of permanent
magnet arrangements ready right now to be manufactured, to be able to have
ready these prototypes for consumer designed products, so as products they are
100% safe for use. To prepare the three books with the scientific know-how
involved in the technology of the invention. Also, it took 4 years from 2012 up
to now for the patent applications, international and national to be published,
to be granted and to be patent pending and also all the patent work had to be
prepared in a very complete legal manner so that the technology would be
patented in a correct legal manner.  <br/>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>Presently, with your support which we believe combined with our guaranteed human presence in all types of transactions, we do have a strong
belief that all new challenges and risks that might come in our way - and we do
not under-estimate them - will be over-passed with success.</p>

</div></div>","The journey
is scientific and exciting rewarding the dream and magnetism is way more beautifully interesting than we thought!






By viewing our timeline
towards the end of the campaign you will observe that it took us 40 years of
hard work to make this dream a reality. The last 11 years we have extensively
informed the scientific community of the new achievements we have invented in
magnetism. Throughout these 11 years of informing the experts, teachers and the
professors of physics and magnetism, we have received a truly positive feedback
from them. They have strongly encouraged us to make these new findings in
magnetism available to the experts but also make them available especially to
our young people so it becomes part of their education.  We greatly believe in the young
minds and trust in them that they, together with their educators, will embrace
with enthusiasm and inventiveness the new scientific findings in magnetism.




Science is
for everyone and we address everyone interested in science and its rewarding
dreams.






This scientific knowledge that
is derived from the invention's formation of its technology is what we would
like to share with you and deliver it to you in the best possible manner,
realizing with responsibility, that you can only presently obtain this
scientific knowledge from us, since it is not available anywhere else in the
bibliography as well as in the commercialization of magnetism. With a great sense of this responsibility we have
created all the product members offered in this campaign.  We would like
to share with you our work in this exciting scientific journey and make you
also an important part of this journey's rewarding dream, so we really mean in practice our
phrase: ""join us in spirit in this scientifically
driven exciting journey, make it your own dream and you will be rewarded"".







What are the products offered?

1) The first product is the “Experimental magnetic device of multiple interactions” comprising two types as a device, offered as perks to each one interested in the
community for making useful experiments on the new findings of magnetism.
In this sense the devices as commercial products function as ""Educational Experimental Scientific Instruments"" for each private user and also enrich the experimental instruments of any scientific laboratory of a specialized physics research organization or of an educational institution and these are:



A) 
The
first type is the ""3+3=6 total interactions device"" as seen on the first pitch
video of the campaign. Each time, on the guide, 3 interactions occur between
the sliding confronted magnetic constructions from 0 distance to infinity and
if we change one of the pair of constructions with another magnetic
construction, the opposite of the first 3 interactions occurs. We define it as the ""3+3=6 interactions device"" (please view first pitch video).


B) 
The
second type is the ""5+5=10 total interactions device"" as viewed on the video
right below. Each time, on the guide, 5 interactions occur between the sliding confronted
magnetic constructions from 0 distance to infinity and if we change one of the
pair of constructions with another magnetic construction, the opposite of the
first 5 interactions occurs. We define it as the ""5+5=10 interactions
device"" (please view video right below):


The following video shows the ""5+5=10 total interactions""
device:


WHAT are the interactions in each device produced and how are they categorized?



The ""3+3=6
interactions device"" uses three in total magnetic
constructions to complete all interactions as follows

           1)  Repulsion in the
middle-further distance
           2)  Unstable balance in the middle distance and
           3)  Attraction with contact in the nearer-middle distance





By changing one of the magnetic constructions
with another one of different construction but keeping one magnetic
construction of the previous two on the guide, the opposite of the above
interactions are created as follows:
            4) 
Attraction
no-contact in the middle further distance
            5) 
Stable
balance in the middle distance and
            6) 
Repulsion
in the near-middle distance




The ""5+5=10
interactions device"" also uses three in total
magnetic constructions to complete
all interactions as follows:         

           1)  Repulsion in the
middle-further distance (outer)

           2) 
Unstable
balance in the middle distance
           3) 
Attraction
no-contact in the nearer-middle distance
           4) 
Stable
balance in the nearest-nearer middle distance
           5) 
Repulsion
in the nearest distance (inner)

By changing one of the magnetic constructions
with another one of different construction but keeping one magnetic
construction of the previous two on the guide, the opposite of the above
interactions are created as follows:
            6) 
Attraction
no-contact in the middle-further distance (outer)
            7) 
Stable
balance in the middle distance
            8) 
Repulsion
in the nearer-middle distance
            9) 
Unstable
balance in the nearest-nearer middle distance
          10) 
Attraction
with contact in the nearest distance (inner)
How do the
interactions of the invention become 16 in total vs the known 2 of the state
of the art?

As
the known repulsion and attraction interactions of the state of the art add to
2, so accordingly in comparison, all the total interactions that the invention
is able to achieve are: ""3+3=6"" with the first type device and ""5+5=10"" with the
second type device giving the ""6+10=16 total interactions"".




How unique, novel, inventive, industrially applicable and mainly creditable is this invention and its products? 

The international patent application published by WIPO-World Intellectual Property Organization is WO2013136097A4 entitled: “Magnetic system of three interactions”. After the strictest international examination (IPER) conducted and stated as such by the WIPO examiners, they have confirmed the novel, industrial applicability and inventive step of all the ten claims of the application. Furthermore, the invention has been granted a patent in Greece and Australia; also, the European Patent Office-EPO has published the ""Grant of patent is intended"" a notice of intention to grant a European patent and The Canadian Intellectual property Office has also issued a ""Notice of Allowance"" to grant a patent and it is patent pending in the U.S.A,, India, Israel and South Africa.



Have the achievements of the invention become known to the world's specialists in the science of magnetism?
Yes, they have. Since 2013 the scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research ""CERN"" have been informed with full scientific presentations of the invention's achievements by the inventor. Specifically, in February 18, 2013 the inventor was invited by the top magnetic scientists of the European Organization for Nuclear Research ""CERN"" to demonstrate experimentally to them, the achievements of the invention at the Geneva laboratories. This invitation came after the demonstration given by the inventor to top scientists of the National Center for Scientific Research (N.C.S.R.) on Jan. 16, 2013, invited by Dr. Michele Barone. Without revealing the technology itself, since it was not published as yet by the Greek patent office O.B.I., the inventor demonstrated in detail to the ""CERN"" scientists the achievements of the invention completing all the experiments, as these are also performed by the two types of experimental devices offered here.
A great thanks and appreciation to Dr. Michele Barone and the scientists of CERN, for their kindness to support us and invite us to exhibit, demonstrate and present the invention at CERN in Geneva and also at Demokritos Nuclear Laboratory in the event CERN-GREECE INDUSTRY DAY, on March 31, 2014.
Many other scientific demonstrations of the invention's achievements have been performed, informing internationally the scientists, physicists, professors, engineers and organizations as well as private companies of the achievements of the invention in magnetism, through seminars, presentations, B2B meetings etc.


Dr. Michele Barone is ""Industry Liaison and Technology Transfer Officer for Greece at CERN"" and ""Associate member of CERN Personnel and retired staff member of Demokritos"".

Dr. Yannis Papaphilippou, the inventor Georgios Kertsopoulos and Dr. Michele Barone at the CCC (CERN CENTRAL CONTROL ROOM) on Tuesday 19 Feb. 2013.
Dr. Yannis Papaphilippou is ""Section leader of Accelerator Physics, Beams Department, CERN"".
Have the 16 magnetic interactions of the invention become part of the educational bibliographical material of the scientific society?
No. Not as yet, because these are so new, as the world patent examiners confirm and also the patent grants confirm it; all the theoretical scientific knowledge that the invention delivers and provides is not knowledge existing in the state of the art. The international bibliography of physics and science does not include, cover or explain in any way the constructional behavior of how one can obtain the achievements of the invention construction wise and make the interactions happen in reality. 

Which
devices and accessories are offered as perks?
On this stage of the campaign we are offering
as perks two types of devices and some of the members of the devices as independent accessories:

What is the number of prototype permanent magnet symmetries of the magnetic constructions that can be available as products?

The number is endless.  The devices can be manufactured in many different varieties of symmetries and arrangements as hundreds of different working prototypes have been successfully constructed and are all ready for manufacturing. As the campaign rolls on and also when we enter successfully the in demand stage of the campaign, we will be able to offer as perks many different designs of symmetries forming hexagons, pentagons, triangles, circles as the following video shows the successfully constructed prototypes. Please view the following 2 videos to get an idea of what is possible to come to you as finished manufactured products after your important and appreciated support:




Many different constructions of prototype permanent
magnet symmetries of  magnetic
constructions, ready to be manufactured as consumer products.
What are the materials used for the construction of the magnetic devices?
The magnetic constructions of the magnetic devices are handmade fine-tuned and calibrated and the magnets are sealed and covered completely with balsa wood. The guide is constructed from finest recyclable MDF with glued parts, no nails, metal or plastic used at all. The compass elevator is all wooden construction. 
Neodymium licensed magnets are used:
The standard permanent magnets used in the magnetic constructions are licensed Neodymium, which are the strongest of their type but they have the property that in a very small distance away from them, they lose their strength considerably in regard to other types. The neodymium permanent magnets provide the strongest possible interactions to occur in the experiments between the confronted magnetic constructions. 
How are the magnetic constructions built and how do they provide absolute 100% safety for the user?
The magnets are strongly glued on two or three thin plastic surfaces and afterwards the whole assembly is well glued, sealed and covered with fully recyclable balsa wood. The magnetic constructions as products are offered to the consumer coated with balsa as shown on the pitch video and the ""5+5=10 interactions"" video and as shown above in the photos and videos of the product members as perks. They will not be offered as the above 2 videos show all the prototypes, which they have the magnets exposed in the symmetries of the magnetic constructions. These are prototypes and we want as prototypes to be able to see the arrangement of each symmetry, but these are not the finished product. The finished products have all the magnets fully sealed, protected and covered with balsa for safety reasons and the user never touches any magnet but only the balsa wood, which covers the magnets. The nickel coating on the magnets in some cases is reported to be possibly responsible for skin allergies and in this manner this probability is avoided since the user never comes in contact with any magnet. Of course, in the instructions of the products the inside symmetries and arrangements of the magnets are fully described and explained to the user.
Therefore, each magnetic device with its constructions is absolutely 100% safe, also with no chance whatsoever of a magnet flying out and injuring possibly the user. 






Do we offer a product that delivers all the scientific knowledge derived from the technology of the invention bibliographically to the community? 


2)  Yes. It is the second
product of the campaign’s goal, which is three books offered also as perks to the
community, covering the scientific aspect of the technology. We would like to
supply the community bibliographically with the scientific knowledge derived
from the technology of the invention and we offer three different books covering each
individual’s needs describing the magnetic arrangements of the permanent
magnets, the many different symmetries, the behavior of the magnetic lines, the
interactions, the interchangeable polarities etc. These books come with
explanatory text, figures and drawings and photos of the constructed assemblies
of the magnetic constructions, in three different publications, to satisfy the specific needs of every one.

What are some examples of products that can be manufactured utilizing the interactions of the invention?

Below are some indicative
examples of the potential applications that can be manufactured by some of the
industrial sectors if the invention is utilized:
1) The ""ATTRACTIVE NO CONTACT""
interaction, where one ""magnetic construction"" attracts the other
with a complete air gap between them, gives the possibility of an application so
that a train engine - real size or toy or robot size - can be connected with the wagon and each wagon with the
next wagon, possessing a complete air gap in-between, with magnets/electromagnets positioned according to the innovation's technology. 
2) Another case is the opposite
application in regard to the first above, where a repulsive interaction of the magnetic constructions occurs at the greater distances and when
these come closer appears a strong attractive force joining the magnetic
constructions. This case can have multiple applications in lifting machines
and cranes, industrial machinery applications, automotive industry, space technology, in nanotechnology and robotics.
3) From the first example is created the
“STABLE BALANCE” interaction and from the second example is created the
“UNSTABLE BALANCE” both of them producing the simultaneous co-existence of the
homogeneous and heterogeneous fields causing immobility of the bodies. These
fields of ""BALANCE PRODUCTION"" can be used in static and kinetic constructional applications giving the
possibility of new assemblies.
4) From the five interactions technology is produced
the ""INTERLOCKING NO CONTACT"" interaction, having as a result the two confronted  bodies to function as one without however touching and without exerting any
repulsive or attractive force to each other. This technology is beneficial for
the non-touch magnetic power transmission constructions transmitting motion from an
energetic to a pathetic spindle-shaft achieving 100% non-friction involvement
and can be used in the manufacturing of non-touch bearings, gears, couplings
and multiple assemblies of power transmission. Also prosthetic members in
humans can be built with this technology having an extremely low coefficient of
friction between the member joints.
COMPLETELY NEW TYPES OF MAGNETIC INTERACTIONS AS NEVER BEFORE BEEN OBSERVED IN MAGNETISM:
The ""ATTRACTIVE NO CONTACT"" interaction, where one solid body ""magnetic construction"" attracts the other solid body ""magnetic construction"" with  a complete air gap between them.
The “STABLE BALANCE” interaction and the “UNSTABLE BALANCE” both of them producing the simultaneous co-existence of the homogeneous and heterogeneous fields causing immobility of the bodies.
The ""INTERLOCKING NO CONTACT"" interaction, having as a result the two confronted solid bodies to function as one without however touching and without exerting any repulsive or attractive force to each other.



What is the initial funding goal and what is our program in investing wisely the contributed amount?

The need:
The above two products as 1) magnetic devices and 2) books have the important need of your support for covering the final cost of producing the manufacturing of the two different types of  magnetic devices and for covering the publication costs of the three
different books. 
All the prototypes-devices are completely ready - in all stages of 
R&D - for manufacturing and also the books are completed - in all 
stages from editing to proof reading and final corrections.The amount needed for covering the cost of producing the manufacturing of the two different types of devices and publishing the three different books is calculated at 20.000 USD total initial flexible funding goal. This is our initial funding goal and it is flexible because we will be able to fulfill all our perk obligations, independently of the reached goal and that is our promise and guarantee to the community in regard to the integrity of our campaign offers. 
The delivery of the perks:
The perks regarding the three books will be ready for delivery in September 2016 and all the perks regarding the magnetic devices and its members will be ready for delivery in October 2016  (please view timeline's last table).
What happens if the initial funding goal is over-passed?

If the initial funding goal is over-passed we will be able to initialize our stretch goals (please view below text on stretch goals) in regard to the creation of the open source interactive platform and also offer some surprise perks in regard to manufacturing more needed by you arrangements of symmetries for the magnetic constructions. 
What is our relationship and participation regarding the community's needs?

We need your feedback, your suggestions and needs are important to us;  whether you are an individual, a research team or a scientist, a professor or a high school, college or university physics laboratory responsible person and you would like more info. get in touch; we want to satisfy your specific needs.
If the real world is now: 16 magnetic interactions vs the known two, one can imagine what more and new real, virtual or imaginary creations can be invented by all you geniuses out there! 




What are the
stretch goals of the open source interactive platform?

3) The third product of the campaign is our offer to the community to build together with the community an open source interactive platform and will be programmed by us in the stretch goals in the very specific stages of creation. The stretch goals then will include what
we would like to offer as scientific knowledge of the technology to everyone in
the community, allowing each and every one to become a member of this open source interactive platform. It will possess as a subject the whole scientific data of the
“Magnetic system of multiple interactions” in its design, creation and
development. 


What will be our contribution and supply to this open source interactive platform?


              We will create the open source interactive platform with
all needed material and human personnel to support it, also, supply the source code
which will have the core aspects of all the details covering the whole new scientific aspect of the invention. Also,
we will work extensively and continuously for informing in the best way
possible the platform with the innermost scientific details involved in this
new magnetic technology enriching all the new design and construction
possibilities that arise. The enlisted members of the platform will be able to
enrich the code with their own knowledge, ideas and developments and have a
chance to interact with the designing of the platform’s data and designing
capabilities. 
Graphics, animation, forums and magnetic interactions in real time:
               The platform will possess capabilities in graphics enriched by scientific data of each different case, animations of interactions in real time, including all the cases of the invention and all its accomplished interactions. Forums will be built according to the subjects concerning the
needs of the members and groups will be able to form and work on specific
projects, whether scientific, technological or theoretical.
Magnetic database, public domain and private sector involvement:
     Also, this open platform
will become an important bibliographical magnetic/electromagnetic database for
organizations, universities, colleges, libraries and also interested companies,
since there will be the possibility of sharing the knowledge with each member
in the community. This will give ignition to many other initiatives that will
occur since the world of open share especially in valuable knowledge subjects
is very fast growing and is also becoming very valuable in the public domain but also in the private sector. The educational process and delivery of scientific and technological information of the platform will be extremely valuable, since this technology is very far ahead of the current bibliographical knowledge
and the platform will enable all educators and students to not only expand their know-how capabilities but also effectively use the
new magnetic findings and possibilities. 
Open architecture scientific know-how of the ""core technology"":
We are offering an open-architecture technology; we keep all rights reserved for the inventive intellectual and industrial patented scale of the technology and all copyrights for the intellectual inventiveness of the scientific work and scientific findings. However, everything else that does not involve patents and copyrights, we offer it as an open-architecture platform able to incorporate an endless number of magnetic and electromagnetic products that will use the science and technology of the invention as a ""core technology"".
Your support is very important for creating this open source interactive platform and that is the reason we have placed it in this campaign as a need that will be funded by the stretch goals.


Risks & Challenges

The invention took 24 years of extremely hard work to become a
reality. It took another 12 years in R&D to be refined in all its aspects
and details, to be complete in every aspect, theoretical, technological and
scientific wise. To possess hundreds of prototype symmetries of permanent
magnet arrangements ready right now to be manufactured, to be able to have
ready these prototypes for consumer designed products, so as products they are
100% safe for use. To prepare the three books with the scientific know-how
involved in the technology of the invention. Also, it took 4 years from 2012 up
to now for the patent applications, international and national to be published,
to be granted and to be patent pending and also all the patent work had to be
prepared in a very complete legal manner so that the technology would be
patented in a correct legal manner.  


Presently, with your support which we believe combined with our guaranteed human presence in all types of transactions, we do have a strong
belief that all new challenges and risks that might come in our way - and we do
not under-estimate them - will be over-passed with success.

















Are the products completely ready for use?
Yes, they are completely ready, as you take them out of the package you can start right away to perform the experiments.



PRECAUTIONS IN REGARD TO MAGNETIC FIELDS: If you wear pacemakers or implanted heart defibrillators the magnetic
devices are not suitable for use by you. You might experience
illness due to your pacemaker’s switching into test mode. Your heart
defibrillator might stop working. If you wear these devices
you have to stay at least 2 meters away from the magnetic devices, you can view
them at a distance but you are strongly advised not to use them. Warn others who might
wear these devices to stay away and not use the magnetic devices.
- Although the experiments are exciting and also surprising and interest very much the children, please consider that magnets are not toys and children should always be guided by an adult when using the magnetic devices which are magnetic scientific instruments.
- Please use and store the magnetic devices as scientific instruments away from devices that might be de-magnetized.",36.0,10,"1 Campaign

Taste a segment of the show recorded at the Mercury Cafe on May 22nd, 2016.
The video and sound recordings at the Mercury Cafe are the foundation of the project.  Half of the funding budget goes into post production editing to make a series of short videos from the Mercury show. Some of the soundtrack will also be released as podcasts.
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Project:</h3>
Social media enables us to spread awareness waves throughout the planet with unprecedented speed and impact.  <b>I want your help generating an awareness wave.</b>  A wave that summons courage, awakens hope, and invites people to step into their power. A wave transmitted through Facebook and YouTube video.  A wave designed to catch people's attention in today's sound byte oriented, mobile device connected world and invite them into a deeper conversation.
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Challenge:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
What kind of future do our collective actions beckon? </li>
<li>What is our personal responsibility in shaping those actions? </li>
<li>How do we show up in the world?</li>
<li>What impact do we have?</li>
</ul>
<b>The time is now!  Our institutions are struggling </b>to address the complex challenges we face.  <b>Paralysis grips our politics</b>, consumed with blame and determination to make the “other side” fail, no matter the cost.  Profit and demographic<b> </b>captive <b>media is obsessed</b> with delivering only news that conforms to what we want to hear. <br/><br/>Our times clamor for profound transformation.  There is a deep hunger for fresh vision, for a new way forward.  <b>This project is intended to feed
that fresh vision, to help explore this new way by creating a series
of short videos exploring topics such as courage, authenticity,
freedom, and awareness.

At THE PHARAOH'S HOUSE, we believe strongly in the power in community, but not just in the teams who create exciting learning environments, but the countless others who ""play"" a daily role in solving the many educational challenges.</p><p>Crowdfunding is a great way in which the general public can help contribute towards making THE PHARAOH'S HOUSE as successful as it can be both in terms of raising resources as well as raising awareness. We believe that everybody, from our backers on this campaign, to teams, to members of our new community, can make a real difference – <strong>and we’re humbled and thankful for each and every one of you.</strong></p><h3><strong>Why the $615,000 figure? </strong></h3><p>After running the numbers and breaking down the various costs of the many moving parts and labor associated with building out a space that embodies the aura found in the Ancient Egyptian section of the MET, BUT where kids can come and immerse themselves in history and exploration, all the while learning valuable math and science skills. For such a winning platform, our Finance team determined that this money will cover many of these associated costs.</p><p>This is really just the first step and facility of many more to come. The more we raise,<strong> THE MORE KIDS WE CAN REACH </strong>– let’s raise 10x that this amount so we can further facilitate the learning successes of the Pharaoh Scientist program, today our annual target is to inspire 100,000 kids, but we’re not stopping there; our next goal is 10x that number ANNUALLY. Do the math and help us spread the word today!</p><h3><strong>How do we know the Pharaoh Scientist lessons will be successful?</strong></h3><p>To stimulate curiosity from historically arcuate real world experiences of the Ancient Egyptians, students are provided with play materials and loose parts, such as blocks, paper, crayons, and clay. As the children reenact, write, pretend play scenarios from ancient Egypt, we help mode and shape those experiences in a mathematical and or scientific way where they can gain a sense of the world around them. These hands on experiences will remain with them; moreover, they will be different along the various developmental stages of their elementary and middle school education.</p><p>During the Pharaoh Scientist lessons children are given “jobs” that make them responsible for their tasks and to interact with others on a development or construction of their event for the Pharaoh Scientist lesson. We strongly believe that grounding children in historical real world experiences will help them learn the mathematical and scientific aspects in a positive way that they will retain and build upon for decades.</p><p>Our process also takes into account the extent of the problem of how many kids can’t read, write or perform basic arithmetic today, and how attractive the Pharaoh Scientist program would be toward motivating those that have been unmotivated and its national appeal to prospective teams focused on enhancing the quality of education in under served communities.</p><p>With these exhaustive considerations accounted for, we are very confident that the Pharaoh Scientist program is going to net incredible results far and wide. If we didn't have confidence in this, we wouldn't launch Pharaoh Scientist in the first place.</p><h3><strong>How much money from the crowdfunding actually goes to the prize?</strong></h3><p>With the exception of the Indiegogo/Finance fees, every dollar goes towards the buildout of our space.</p><h3><strong>What payment methods do you accept?</strong></h3><p>We accept major credit cards.</p><h3><strong>Can I donate from outside the USA?</strong></h3><p>Absolutely! </p><h3><strong>When will my perk prizes be delivered?</strong></h3><p>We are currently estimating shipping in March 2017.</p><h3><strong>I love what you are doing!

Educators across the academic spectrum agree that we need to find new and creative ways to inspire those who have become uninspired or feel lost in the ""factory"" of standardized education.   THE PHARAOH’S HOUSE concept of combining the exploration of the many fascinating aspects of Ancient Egypt within a math and science program for kids is sheer brilliance! Science Consultant, Dmitry Yavich, PhD According to the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics - Young learners' future understanding of mathematics requires an early foundation based on a high-quality, challenging, and stimulating mathematics education. Young children in every setting should experience mathematics through effective, research-based curricula and teaching practices.That’s why (in circa 2016) I founded THE PHARAOH'S HOUSE.  We are the “Harvard / MIT” of math and science exploration and inspiration, all through the “lens” of the Ancient Egyptians, but we need your financial assistance to buildout our space.  THE PHARAOH'S HOUSE has an engaging hands-on approach to learning and comprehending math and science for children - called Pharaoh Scientist. Our space in its current state    However, following your generous financial support, new life will be breathed into this facility, so each child's creative idea generation process becomes stimulated, their focus is now shifted to the imaginal, the achievable, the possible, all as we explore Ancient Egypt form the lens of math and science.  Projected final look of THE PHARAOH'S HOUSE.  From the moment children walk into THE PHARAOH'S HOUSE, we want them to be enchanted to open up that creative and analytical genius that's waiting to be challenged and inspired. Reawaken their natural curiosity that's being suppressed under the weight of preparing for the next set of standardized tests. In addition to holding the palatial crowning birthday ceremonies, the Pharaoh's inner court room is where would be Pharaoh Scientist will come to learn all about the Pharaoh's mathematicians, scientists, scribes, archaeologists and artist; moreover, how they too have the genius to design and create the very ideas from their dreams.     Again, I’m here today seeking funding to build out our flagship space to museum grade.  I want THE PHARAOH'S HOUSE to be encouraging kids in the study of math and science, as soon as possible, and thanks to your generous financial support, we can make this dream a reality.Stand with us today and make a difference by contributing what you can, sharing this campaign with everyone you know that cares about improving and complementing the quality of education and by joining The Pharaoh's House Working Families Community. $615,000 STRETCH GOAL!Our flagship facility is centrally located in Manhattan’s Garment District, making it easily accessible from any of the surrounding boroughs, but it is currently just raw space in much need of an Ancient Egyptian ""face lift.""  We’re seeking this funding of $615,000 to build out our space so it reflects the aura and majesty of the Ancient Egyptian section found at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  We need you to help us to spread the word to hit this new goal! An integral part of awakening the scientific genius in kids involves “placing” them in an atmosphere where exciting exploration abounds.  Ancient Egypt’s treasure trove of cultural and mystical icons and practices give children a more substantive and worldly experience which many parents will appreciate.  Date palms and majestic columns adorned with hieroglyphics transport your child to Ancient Egypt where mystery chambers, statues of gods and Pharaohs, and mystical icons awaken their imagination and approach to learning. Each child’s birthday celebration done at The Pharaoh’s House will be completely unique and customized to them.  Those interested in critters get the critter special, those interested in archeology get the dig, those wanting to know the power of Cleopatra, Hatshepsut (the woman who dared to become Pharaoh-King of Egypt), they will get to know that power!!!Why Ancient Egypt you ask? Inspiring the love of math and science, through the “eyes” of the Ancient Egyptians is not only empowering, but historically accurate.  Ancient Egypt gives us a hands-on approach to not only learning, but art, and an elegance they may not otherwise be exposed too.Because our flagship venue, in midtown Manhattan, will reflect the majesty of Ancient Egypt that will inspire creative thinking and discussions about those historical accomplishments, we will use this exuberance to cultivate their thinking and understanding of the practical applications of how math and science have been used to build one of the greatest civilizations in modern history - including the one we live in today. 
Additional Work Needed to Our Space: 
Replace major building systems (HVAC, electrical, plumbing, fire protection and code compliance improvements, including ADA).
Install state-of-the-art: audio/visual equipment, lighting, security and monitoring system.
Install acoustical shell, sound proofing and entertainment equipment.
Improve ceiling grid, painting, flooring and signage.

Remember, be sure to join The Pharaoh’s House Working Families Community it is packed with savings and lots of fun facts designed for children of all ages. Your Questions, AnsweredWhy are you doing this?This Indiegogo campaign is designed to further enhance the educational community, of teachers, students, parents and families as a collaborative team that are focused on providing more enhanced out of the classroom learning experiences for children. At THE PHARAOH'S HOUSE, we believe strongly in the power in community, but not just in the teams who create exciting learning environments, but the countless others who ""play"" a daily role in solving the many educational challenges.Crowdfunding is a great way in which the general public can help contribute towards making THE PHARAOH'S HOUSE as successful as it can be both in terms of raising resources as well as raising awareness. We believe that everybody, from our backers on this campaign, to teams, to members of our new community, can make a real difference – and we’re humbled and thankful for each and every one of you.Why the $615,000 figure? After running the numbers and breaking down the various costs of the many moving parts and labor associated with building out a space that embodies the aura found in the Ancient Egyptian section of the MET, BUT where kids can come and immerse themselves in history and exploration, all the while learning valuable math and science skills. For such a winning platform, our Finance team determined that this money will cover many of these associated costs.This is really just the first step and facility of many more to come. The more we raise, THE MORE KIDS WE CAN REACH – let’s raise 10x that this amount so we can further facilitate the learning successes of the Pharaoh Scientist program, today our annual target is to inspire 100,000 kids, but we’re not stopping there; our next goal is 10x that number ANNUALLY. Do the math and help us spread the word today!How do we know the Pharaoh Scientist lessons will be successful?To stimulate curiosity from historically arcuate real world experiences of the Ancient Egyptians, students are provided with play materials and loose parts, such as blocks, paper, crayons, and clay. As the children reenact, write, pretend play scenarios from ancient Egypt, we help mode and shape those experiences in a mathematical and or scientific way where they can gain a sense of the world around them. These hands on experiences will remain with them; moreover, they will be different along the various developmental stages of their elementary and middle school education.During the Pharaoh Scientist lessons children are given “jobs” that make them responsible for their tasks and to interact with others on a development or construction of their event for the Pharaoh Scientist lesson. We strongly believe that grounding children in historical real world experiences will help them learn the mathematical and scientific aspects in a positive way that they will retain and build upon for decades.Our process also takes into account the extent of the problem of how many kids can’t read, write or perform basic arithmetic today, and how attractive the Pharaoh Scientist program would be toward motivating those that have been unmotivated and its national appeal to prospective teams focused on enhancing the quality of education in under served communities.With these exhaustive considerations accounted for, we are very confident that the Pharaoh Scientist program is going to net incredible results far and wide. If we didn't have confidence in this, we wouldn't launch Pharaoh Scientist in the first place.How much money from the crowdfunding actually goes to the prize?With the exception of the Indiegogo/Finance fees, every dollar goes towards the buildout of our space.What payment methods do you accept?We accept major credit cards.Can I donate from outside the USA?Absolutely! When will my perk prizes be delivered?We are currently estimating shipping in March 2017.I love what you are doing!

<p>My name is Eric “Fenix” Nelson. I currently live in Austin, Texas. I am an educator by trade, but also have always been an advocate and activist. I have taught at two tribally run schools, am an O.N.A.C. member, and stay involved in local Pow Wows and community efforts.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>On Oct. 27th militarized police and national guards cleared the Sacred Ground prayer camp that rested in the pathway of the pipeline construction. They interrupted sweat lodges and prayer circles, beating, pepper spraying, and throwing to the ground everyone present. If you are Catholic, imagine being pulled out of confessional, and being thrown to the ground and sat on. Or if you ascribe to another denomination of Christianity, yanked up from waiting to receive communion, to be beaten, and maced. This was what the peacefully praying people suffered for protecting their water supply, and praying for the sanctity of life that water provides. No amount of jobs is worth this. No amount of money from the sale of local oil is worth this. No amount of electricity or gas to drive cars is worth this!</p>
<p>Energy Transfer Partners, a corporation based in Dallas, in conjunction with Chervon, Sunoco and other investors is trying to hurry the completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline to begin pumping oil fracked from the Bakken fields in North Dakota to processing plants in Illinois, and Texas. Fracking creates toxic radioactive water in the process of extracting the last possible amount of oil from previously drilled reserves. This destabilizes the underground rock strata resulting in earthquakes, and the release of gasses.</p>
<p>This is being done under the premise of emminent domain, which allowed the government to run public utilities, like telephone, or electricity lines, across private property.  However the eventually processed fracked oil will also be shipped out and sold to foreign interests. That is hardly a public utility. It is vital for all of us and our posterity to keep this production from establishing itself. It is a ticking time bomb of environmental pollution across the largest watershed and river system in North America.</p>
<p>Winter will soon be upon the Oceti Sakowin and Sacred Stone Prayer camps and the rest of the water protectors standing with the Standing Rock Sioux. The water protectors have pledged to stay through the Winter, to continue to stop the poisoning of the largest watershed in North America. With that colder weather batteries can be less reliable, and their energy needs will increase as they'll daily need heat.</p>
<p>The media camp seems to have it’s power needs met now with the two solar panel trailers presented by Mark Ruffalo with the Solutions Project, and the original 20ft trailer of a 1.5kw solar unit powering the kitchen brought by Doug Yazzie and Brett Issac  renewable energy Project Manager for the Shonto Community Development Corporation in Navajo Nation. These trailers are now set up and have begun to produce electricity, but with 40,000+ people, more is still necessary. Instead of adding to the infrastructure of these arrays, the solar panels purchased here will be set up independently at the original prayer camp, and the school, which are still without electricity.</p>

<p>The Sacred Stone Prayer camp was the first camp established last Spring on reservation land. It is where the elders, and leaders have met to conference, to conduct ceremony, and stand united in prayer. As numbers grew, Oceti Sakowin camp grew to house all the other First Nations to arrive, and additional supporters and allies. A school for the children has been running there. The Red Warrior Camp was established at the request of the original Camp of the Sacred Stones and was one of the first groups to utilized escalated direct action to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. These solar panels will provide light and heat for these three groups.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is a company in San Antonio called CoWatt Energy that manufactures an all-in-one free-standing solar panel ready to go with built in inverter. These units are stackable and easy to transport and set up.  They are made for on the ground solar-powered electricity production in rural applications. I can think of no better way to supply power to the prayer camp and school than clean solar power. This campaign is to purchase a sufficient number of units to send to the Sacred Stone Camp and their school.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We need the funds to purchase as many solar panel units as possible to sustain the camps and school through the harsh Winter months. Daylight is diminished during these times by clouds, and the more panels, the more electricity can be harvested. The goal here is to get an initial shipment out quickly before the first snow fall. The beauty of the Power Funnel is more units can quickly and easily be added on later. If the goal is not met or the order isn't enough for the camps needs, more can be sent later.</p>
<p>Fox Redsky will be traveling back to the camp for the third time, and will deliver and present the solar panels purchased from this campaign. They will be left there for the long haul and as a gift to the tribe.  </p>
<p>I will be in contact with Patrick Joel Pulliam, Lyla June, Kandi Mossett, and Dallas Goldtooth organizers with the Indigenous Environmental Network, LaDonna Allard and other camp members as well as department heads at the reservation office to help with installation and any problems that might arise with the arrays.</p>
<p>As a contributor you get the satisfaction of preserving pure drinking water for half of North America for your lifetime and posterity.</p>
<p>Many of you have been watching the #NoDAPL movement and are wondering how you can help. And what better way to help Mother Earth than getting off of fossil fuels and on to renewable energy.  A solar unit costs a lot of money to create and install, a typical house rooftop installation usually costs about $12,000. By comparison each PowerFunnel retails for $700.

</div></div>","My name is Eric “Fenix” Nelson. I currently live in Austin, Texas. I am an educator by trade, but also have always been an advocate and activist. I have taught at two tribally run schools, am an O.N.A.C. member, and stay involved in local Pow Wows and community efforts.
The Impact
On Oct. 27th militarized police and national guards cleared the Sacred Ground prayer camp that rested in the pathway of the pipeline construction. They interrupted sweat lodges and prayer circles, beating, pepper spraying, and throwing to the ground everyone present. If you are Catholic, imagine being pulled out of confessional, and being thrown to the ground and sat on. Or if you ascribe to another denomination of Christianity, yanked up from waiting to receive communion, to be beaten, and maced. This was what the peacefully praying people suffered for protecting their water supply, and praying for the sanctity of life that water provides. No amount of jobs is worth this. No amount of money from the sale of local oil is worth this. No amount of electricity or gas to drive cars is worth this!
Energy Transfer Partners, a corporation based in Dallas, in conjunction with Chervon, Sunoco and other investors is trying to hurry the completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline to begin pumping oil fracked from the Bakken fields in North Dakota to processing plants in Illinois, and Texas. Fracking creates toxic radioactive water in the process of extracting the last possible amount of oil from previously drilled reserves. This destabilizes the underground rock strata resulting in earthquakes, and the release of gasses.
This is being done under the premise of emminent domain, which allowed the government to run public utilities, like telephone, or electricity lines, across private property.  However the eventually processed fracked oil will also be shipped out and sold to foreign interests. That is hardly a public utility. It is vital for all of us and our posterity to keep this production from establishing itself. It is a ticking time bomb of environmental pollution across the largest watershed and river system in North America.
Winter will soon be upon the Oceti Sakowin and Sacred Stone Prayer camps and the rest of the water protectors standing with the Standing Rock Sioux. The water protectors have pledged to stay through the Winter, to continue to stop the poisoning of the largest watershed in North America. With that colder weather batteries can be less reliable, and their energy needs will increase as they'll daily need heat.
The media camp seems to have it’s power needs met now with the two solar panel trailers presented by Mark Ruffalo with the Solutions Project, and the original 20ft trailer of a 1.5kw solar unit powering the kitchen brought by Doug Yazzie and Brett Issac  renewable energy Project Manager for the Shonto Community Development Corporation in Navajo Nation. These trailers are now set up and have begun to produce electricity, but with 40,000+ people, more is still necessary. Instead of adding to the infrastructure of these arrays, the solar panels purchased here will be set up independently at the original prayer camp, and the school, which are still without electricity.

<h3>How did it start?</h3>
<p>Everything began with a crowd-sourced book project in 2010, when young Bosnian author Jasminko Halilović asked his peers ""What did a war childhood mean to you?"" After collecting more than 1000 short recollections (up to 160 characters) from more than 1000 people who were children during the war, he set out to edit them into a book. In 2013 Jasminko published “War Childhood” in the Bosnian language. Since then, the book has been translated into five more languages and further published in German and Japanese.</p>
<h3>From book to museum</h3>
<p>While working on his book, Halilović communicated with hundreds of participants. He noticed that besides feeling a need to share stories from their wartime childhoods, they also tended to connect their memories to physical objects. At the beginning of 2015 he assembled a team of anthropologists, historians, psychologists, and other contributors, which first developed a methodology and then began to put together a collection for the future War Childhood Museum. Fifteen months later, this collection now holds more than 3000 items and stories, as well as almost 100 hours of video testimonies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473833307/sfxv9tre8xgtk3wkixyy.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In a country with staggering youth unemployment and an ongoing brain drain, the War Childhood Museum gives voice to the formative experiences of a generation marginalized by the country's post-war political economy. Just as importantly, it provides Bosnians of all ages a rare opportunity to confront the traumas of their recent past without reinforcing ethnic boundaries. Highlighting some of the pressing socio-cultural issues in contemporary Bosnia-Herzegovina, the War Childhood Museum also speaks to such broader topics as child development, social entrepreneurship, and historical memory in post-conflict societies.</p>

<p>The experience of growing up in war is complex. Our participants talk about it through various stories and objects. Here are some of them:</p>

<h3>Mission and vision</h3>
<p><strong>The mission</strong> of the War Childhood Museum is to continuously and in accordance to the highest standards document and digitize materials related to growing up in the war, and to present the archived materials throughout various media channels in order to educate a broad audience about this experience.</p>
<p><strong>The vision</strong> of the War Childhood Museum is to help individuals overcome past traumatic experiences and prevent traumatization of others, and at the same time advance mutual understanding at the collective level in order to enhance personal and social development.</p>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Exhibition</span></h3>
<p>Our first exhibition was held in May 2016. In ten days we drew over 4000 people. Visitors filled out two guest books with their comments and impressions, including the following:</p>
<p>""It’s wonderful to be part of this huge project. Thank you for restoring dignity and self-confidence to the young victims of war."" (Sanja, participant)</p>
<p>""The exhibition was great. Only when I saw the exhibition did I realize that I should be grateful to have so much stuff. From this moment on I am grateful."" (Omer, 8 years old)</p>
<h3>Permanent exhibit</h3>
<p>After months of struggle with local authorities we have finally secured a space for a permanent exhibit. It is located in the heart of Sarajevo and covers 263m2. We are going to renovate and equip the space to fit the needs of the exhibit.</p>

<h3>Future Goals</h3>
<p>After the initial internal research phase in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we will expand our research activities to other post-conflict zones. Our ten-year plan is to establish the world’s largest archive on the subject.  We will replicate our successful model in other countries by way of exhibitions and educational activities, thus broadening our impact.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Cuttington Campus School is a private primary and secondary school. It goes from nursery all the way to 12th Grade. The civil war  that took place over 13 years ago (1989-2003)  in Liberia took a huge toll on the school. Today you can still  see  remnants of the war, as the school struggles to get back to normalcy. The buildings look ruined, classrooms still remain damaged, windows and doors broken, damaged toilets and plumbing system, to name a few.  Yet students come regularly primped in their uniforms ready to learn. Despite all of the challenges, like the rain flooding the classrooms, termites eating the ceiling, no running toilets,  more and more students still come. Even our youngest learners and their teachers, in the kindergarten division of the school, are regularly in class despite all of these challenges. So, this year we decided to focus on the KG Division for this campaign because they are at the foundational level. This is where they start to form their understanding.  It is very bothersome to think that if the students get used to learning in the environment  such as it is now,  what message are they getting ?</li>
<li>By you  contributing to this renovation fundraiser, it will impact our students an teachers realise that their school environment does not have to be harsh for learning. It will send a message to the our first learners , the toddlers, to experience and see what is a normal learning classroom</li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $ 10,000. </p>
<p>Campus School's Kindergarten means a renovation transformation to make a conducive learning environment that is:</p>
<p> Up to standards for learning with fixed windows, doors, ceilings, restrooms,  good chalk board that doesn't squeak</p>
<p>Well sanitized  with working flush toilets - no more smell of sewage</p>
<p>Chairs and desks that are suitable for the young learners height</p>
<p>Equipped with basic modern amenities like an air - condition for the hot weather</p>
<p>Equipped with  a  play  and reading area  to inspire learning </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Students will get a beautiful classroom environment that is far different from what they have been used to. Students will enjoy the learning experience in a conducive environment. No more  smell of sewage in the classroom.  This will encourage learners to learn and not just trying to cope in a harsh environment. They will actually be able to  learn and play . Teachers will enjoy the art of teaching again with their students in a clean and beautiful atmosphere.  </p>
<p>We recently did a food-sale on the campus  for the KG division and all of the students , teachers and many parents  bought the food to support . Although not enough money was raised for the project, but the teachers were very much appreciative and happy that their building was getting some attention.

<h3>Risks  and Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenge might be finding a good contractor within the area, committed to doing a good job in a timely manner and not delaying the work where it goes into instructional months.    There are contractors within the school campus area but the risk is that they may delay since they tend to work several other contracts at the same time.  Finding contractors from further away starts to get more costly. </p>

Our feature-length documentary ""A Place to Stand"" has been called ""a compelling look at the power of language"" (Pasatiempo). Academy Award-winning Director Taylor Hackford (""Ray"", ""The Devil's Advocate"") said it ""presents Jimmy's story in the best way: by letting this great poet tell his own tale - and no one can tell a tale like Jimmy Santiago Baca."" </p><p>Our film has been seen by thousands in film festival screenings around the U.S., but our goal has always been more: to bring the film to schools, prisons, juvenile detention facilities and communities where this story can make the biggest impact. Jimmy's memoir remains very popular in prisons and in Los Angeles, it's the most stolen book from the Street Poets library. This is only part of what proves the hunger and need for this story<b>. </b></p><p>With your support, we will make the film and companion curriculum available for low-income communities and educational facilities nationwide. We know this film, Jimmy's story, can change lives. That's why we're fundraising. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>Our Educational Program</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453236700/ydiev2op1xnhszuizoao.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><i>Jimmy giving a writing workshop at a school in Guam.</i></p><p>From the beginning, we wanted to do more than just produce and distribute our film -- we wanted to bring it to viewers on whom it could have a deep impact. So we designed curriculum and a student workbook. The idea is that the film can better reach its crucial audience -- teenagers, at-risk youth, and incarcerated individuals -- with a focused conversation surrounding its themes.</p><p>""Finding A Place to Stand"", the film's curriculum, includes group discussions, activities, poetry prompts, and free-writes, and is centered on the concepts of individual power and strength. It has been piloted in nearly a dozen schools and has received much positive feedback from the teachers -- and the students! -- who have used it thus far.</p><p>You can view excerpts of the curriculum here: <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/qrd2624ydujs692/Curriculum%20Sample.pdf?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Finding A Place to Stand Curriculum Sample</a></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>Our Goals for 2016:</b></p><ul>

In this world of increasing negativity, we <i>need</i> stories like Jimmy's, more than ever,
to serve as a counterbalance, to communicate that there is always hope and
always possibility for positive change.
<b>Jimmy is a powerful role model for populations without many role models:
incarcerated individuals, adolescents on the
edge, and others impoverished and neglected by society. </b><br/></p><p>We know that we have
something special on our hands, but without your support, the film won’t go
very far. We don’t have a big distributor or a studio behind us. We don’t have big
money. All we have is sweat and determination and passion. That’s why we’re
crowdfunding - we need support to fund our grassroots distribution campaign. </p>

This project has been a people-powered effort from the very beginning and we want to continue that tradition until we achieve our goals. Without over a thousand people contributing from $1 to $20,000, we would have never completed the film.<b> Because of that, we aren't beholden to investors or other interests - we can devote all of our resources into the communities we're aiming to serve. </b><div>

<p>In 2010, a 26-year-old Daniel Glick visited a friend's friend at Auburn Penitentiary. He was deeply struck by the intensity of the place and started cross-examining Tommy, who had been in prison for 15 years at that point, about life behind bars. The friend recommended Jimmy Santiago Baca’s memoir A Place to Stand. Daniel bought it, read it, and instantly knew he had to make a film about Jimmy’s experience.</p>
<p>Daniel moved to New Mexico in 2011, teamed up with Gabriel Baca (Jimmy's son) to form Catamount Films, and spent the next several years creating the film version of ""A Place to Stand"". Their intention was not only to shed light on the difficult experience of incarceration but -- most importantly -- to spread the message that it is possible to overcome even the most difficult circumstances.</p>

</div></div>","Our MissionJimmy teaching at a school in GuamOur mission is simple: to impact as many lives with our film as possible. We always knew that the early life of Jimmy Santiago Baca -- how his unlikely discovery of poetry while incarcerated in one of the worst US prisons transformed him from an illiterate, violent convict to a beloved, world-renowned writer -- was inspirational. Our feature-length documentary ""A Place to Stand"" has been called ""a compelling look at the power of language"" (Pasatiempo). Academy Award-winning Director Taylor Hackford (""Ray"", ""The Devil's Advocate"") said it ""presents Jimmy's story in the best way: by letting this great poet tell his own tale - and no one can tell a tale like Jimmy Santiago Baca."" Our film has been seen by thousands in film festival screenings around the U.S., but our goal has always been more: to bring the film to schools, prisons, juvenile detention facilities and communities where this story can make the biggest impact. Jimmy's memoir remains very popular in prisons and in Los Angeles, it's the most stolen book from the Street Poets library. This is only part of what proves the hunger and need for this story. With your support, we will make the film and companion curriculum available for low-income communities and educational facilities nationwide. We know this film, Jimmy's story, can change lives. That's why we're fundraising. Our Educational ProgramJimmy giving a writing workshop at a school in Guam.From the beginning, we wanted to do more than just produce and distribute our film -- we wanted to bring it to viewers on whom it could have a deep impact. So we designed curriculum and a student workbook. The idea is that the film can better reach its crucial audience -- teenagers, at-risk youth, and incarcerated individuals -- with a focused conversation surrounding its themes.""Finding A Place to Stand"", the film's curriculum, includes group discussions, activities, poetry prompts, and free-writes, and is centered on the concepts of individual power and strength. It has been piloted in nearly a dozen schools and has received much positive feedback from the teachers -- and the students! -- who have used it thus far.You can view excerpts of the curriculum here: Finding A Place to Stand Curriculum SampleOur Goals for 2016:
Over 50 public screenings across the US .
Release the film digitally and on DVD for consumers.
Partner with an educational distributor to maximize our reach to schools.
Secure broadcast distribution (TV presentation) for the film.
Provide the film, curriculum, and workbook materials to over 100 schools, prisons, and organizations.
Partner with prison reform organizations to use the film as an activism and awareness-raising tool.
Why Did We Choose Crowdfunding?Our team at the world premiere of A Place to Stand in 2014. 
In this world of increasing negativity, we need stories like Jimmy's, more than ever,
to serve as a counterbalance, to communicate that there is always hope and
always possibility for positive change.
Jimmy is a powerful role model for populations without many role models:
incarcerated individuals, adolescents on the
edge, and others impoverished and neglected by society. We know that we have
something special on our hands, but without your support, the film won’t go
very far. We don’t have a big distributor or a studio behind us. We don’t have big
money. All we have is sweat and determination and passion. That’s why we’re
crowdfunding - we need support to fund our grassroots distribution campaign. 

This project has been a people-powered effort from the very beginning and we want to continue that tradition until we achieve our goals. Without over a thousand people contributing from $1 to $20,000, we would have never completed the film. Because of that, we aren't beholden to investors or other interests - we can devote all of our resources into the communities we're aiming to serve. 


Our Story
Director Daniel Glick with Producer Gabriel Baca and Director of Photography Michael Gordon shooting ""A Place to Stand"".
In 2010, a 26-year-old Daniel Glick visited a friend's friend at Auburn Penitentiary. He was deeply struck by the intensity of the place and started cross-examining Tommy, who had been in prison for 15 years at that point, about life behind bars. The friend recommended Jimmy Santiago Baca’s memoir A Place to Stand. Daniel bought it, read it, and instantly knew he had to make a film about Jimmy’s experience.
Daniel moved to New Mexico in 2011, teamed up with Gabriel Baca (Jimmy's son) to form Catamount Films, and spent the next several years creating the film version of ""A Place to Stand"". Their intention was not only to shed light on the difficult experience of incarceration but -- most importantly -- to spread the message that it is possible to overcome even the most difficult circumstances.

The Trailer

The documentary itself details the childhood, conviction, and incarceration of Jimmy Santiago Baca, focusing intently on his transformation through literacy. 
Jimmy’s life shows us plainly that the power of literacy and self-expression to affirm life and enable us to make choices of healing, community, and service. In short -- it shows all of us who feel trapped that there is hope.

Budget Breakdown

<p>·<span> 
</span>Two exciting fun and
educational card games.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Familiarizes players
with the human body.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Provides information
on how to keep the human body healthy.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>When we exceed our
funding goal we will donate games to underprivileged youth programs (nonprofit
organizations) </p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The fundamental idea is to
familiarize players with the different organs of the human body and ways of
keeping the human body healthy. The Anatomy Connection card games editions 1
and 2 are beneficial to children because it gives them a foundation on how the
body works, as well as ways to keep it healthy. The more children know about
the human body the more likely they will make decisions that are healthy for
them.</p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>We’re just two creative parents
who enjoyed playing card games as children. The human body has always
fascinated me, so one day while researching information about the human body it
dawned on me, kids/people would love to have a fun way to learn about the human
body. So my wife and I began developing the games, we wanted to teach children
about the human body in a fun way so my wife decided to color coordinate the
different systems of the body. I wanted to spice things up with “wild” cards
and “action” cards, so I added some organ donor cards and bypass cards to the
games. The games are played by simply matching up the color coordinated cards
to receive an organ for that system. The first person to complete their body
board wins the game. This teaches children what organs go in which systems of
the human body. We also had help from my good friend Dr. Arthur Wolf who was able to add facts to the cards.  The graphics took some time to develop, but
with the help of my artistic wife and a graphic design artist (Brian Duddles) our
vision for Anatomy Connection was brought to life.</p>
<p><b>What we need and what you get</b></p>
<p>To launch the
project, we need funding for the printing; the body boards, the die-cut
chipboard pieces and the boxes.  The bigger the order, the less it costs
per game, so we’d like to order at least 2500 of each edition of the games,
which is what the money collected from the Indiegogo campaign will go towards. </p>
<p><b>Perks</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>For $20 receive one
copy of Anatomy Connection card game edition, you will be able to specify which
edition you want.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>For $30 receive both
editions of the Anatomy Connection card games, edition 1 provides facts about human
organs. Edition 2 provides facts on keeping the systems of the human body
healthy.</p>

</span>For $25 receive a

<h3>How would the world be different if every change effort had a network map of the people working toward that change?</h3>
<p>The fundamental tool for learning about, developing, strengthening and leveraging human networks is a network map. A map that reveals the kinds of relationships people have to one another, the kinds of interests they share with one another, what they can offer to and need from one another, and what would motivate them to contribute to the network.</p>
<p>A map that helps the system see itself. A map that stimulates the collective imagination about what it means to be a network, and what a network makes possible.</p>
<p>How different would our lives be, if we could visualize, even if only in part, the immensity of what we ARE together?</p>
<h3>Help us unleash the power of Network Mapping for complex systems change.</h3>

<h3>Phases I &amp; II are completed</h3>
<p>Phases I &amp; II were all about getting the basic functionality in place, testing it with clients (it works great!), and making the basic features available to the public online, for a very low price. And we've done that. (Yayy!!)</p>
<p>Phases I &amp; II were entirely self-funded – we invested our own time and our own money to hire the developers - because we feel so strongly about this critical tool.</p>
<p>But our pockets are not deep, and we’re tapped out! Launching Phase II is super exciting, but it's a loss-leader, a nearly-free introductory part of the cost structure - so even if it’s an instant wild success, it won’t stop the financial drain.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>We need help getting to Phase III</h3>
<p>We need a quick, $6,000 cash infusion to get through to Phase III, when the project can become financially sustainable.</p>
<p>In Phase III, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop the bells &amp; whistles that professional mappers (like us) need. These features will give our clients the customization they want, and make mappers jobs even easier (so they can make more maps!)</li>
<li>Develop Network Mapping learning curriculum to help increase capacity in addition to offering tools.</li>
<li>Develop an online community for learning everything there is to know about network mapping – a network of network mappers.</li>
<li>Continue to research &amp; prototype ways for network mapping to facilitate systems change.</li>
<li>Continue to enhance the tools based on those experiments. </li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the vision - Phases I &amp; II solved the biggest technical barriers and Phase III ensures the solution remains available,  spreads capacity, and promotes the network mapping paradigm.</p>
<p>We want to ensure that the basics of sumApp are always affordable - but without the immediate financial push to help us roll out those extra bells &amp; whistles, we won't be able to keep it going.</p>
<p>As you contribute, our developers will turn your money directly into sumApp improvements, and we'll keep you informed about those improvements in real time. </p>

Life-Changers and Game-Changers. Radicals and Revolutionaries. Risk takers and Adventurers. Creatives and Thinkers. 
These are the people that will shape the future- and the way is through education. Authentic, quality education. Right from the very start.  

Education is the way to radically impact the future and change the face of whole societies. It's the proven and sustainable way of lifting people out of poverty.
“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world,”  Nelson Mandela
Short history
""We still remember the overwhelming joy that exploded among us, when it was announced that we have been given 7.5 hectares of  land. 
Now, 8 years later, Global Challenge Leadership Campus is a platform and launching pad to the future leaders of South Africa. We have built 2 schools on the campus, (Global Leadership Academy and Oakridge Academy) together with resident houses (for students that come from far) and a memorial house (for our volunteers). And we need your help to further the building project. We can not do it without you...""
Global Challenge is registered with the South African Department of Social Development since 2009 as a Non Profit Organization, with registration number: 066-651-NPO. The architect, engineers and other experts working on this project have offered their services on a volunteer basis. This is an encouraging sign proving that this venture is worth the sacrifice and investment from you.

What We Need & What You Get

We have two schools with close to 400 children- and more are coming next year.
To meet the need we are adding 4 CLASSROOMS with an estimated cost of $4500 per classroom. 
You invest. We educate.
You don't have to do any of the work. Your contribution will harvest a great reward.


The Impact
Our province (Eastern Cape) has the lowest average pass rate in South Africa. Yet our high school, Global Leadership Academy, has consistently scored a 100% pass rate in our final school year- for the last 4 years! 
Your investment directly influences the child on the ground. Better facilities mean more students that can be directly influenced to become the leaders of the future.
Many of our students have gone on to study and work. Many who never had a realistic opportunity of doing so in the past.
No child should receive a watered-down education. We want to give the best to create the best.

Risks & Challenges
Next year's students are already enrolled - we are working around the clock to make the deadline of finishing our 4 new classrooms.

Cada uno de ellos ha tenido su propia historia –con flores y espinas–, y en todos hemos querido que las tecnologías manuales de producción y reproducción de la imagen formen parte del proceso creativo. Tapas impresas en serigrafía, tipografía dibujada a mano, papel hecho en Venezuela, música especialmente compuesta para la ocasión… son algunas de las cosas que hacen a nuestros libros objetos realmente especiales.

We also believe that women are the changemakers in their communities and that their worldwide oppression is damaging to their communities.</p><p>This is why I have decided to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in March 2019 with an international all-women's group. The trek is organised by an Australian organisation called 'Wanderlust Women's Adventures' (<a href=""http://www.wanderlustwomensadventures.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.wanderlustwomensadventures.com</a>) who organise sustainable travel giving back to local communities and especially women by providing reusable sanitary kits, education and small business incentives. </p><p>With this trek, we hope to raise awareness of women's plights and the threats indigenous communities face worldwide.</p><p>We appreciate your kindness and generosity and would like to reward you again with beautiful gifts in exchange for your donation.</p><p>We offer Masai blankets, earrings, bracelets and beautifully beaded Masai sandals which is a new perk we introduced for this campaign. We also offer you the unique opportunity to come and stay with us in our traditional Masai home. </p><p>Should your generous contributions push us over our goal, we will use these to fund more material for more kits. </p><p> </p><p>This campaign does not fund a one-off improvement in the lives of the Masai. This campaign funds education and skills and capacity building which will last a lifetime. With this campaign, we guarantee a step towards sustainability to last for generations to come and which will ease the pressure the Masai face trying to sustain their traditional way of life. </p><p> </p><p>I have come to love my husband's tribe - each and everyone of them is family to me. There is nothing I wish for more than to see this beautiful tribe survive the onslaught of modernity which has befallen it. I believe the Masai’s culture to be just as worthy of preservation as Africa’s natural heritage like lions and elephants - and I try with all that I do to help them find a balance between tradition and modernity for the sake of their tribal identity.</p><p>So with this campaign, you are not only funding women empowerment and promoting gender equality. You are not only implementing sustainable development. You are helping safeguard our world's cultural heritage and one of our planet's last remaining indigenous tribes. </p><p> </p><p>Please consider supporting us and please do spread the word about this campaign. Talk to your friends and family and feel free to share away. Check out my previous campaigns and my social media accounts and please get in touch if you have any questions or suggestions.</p><p>I hope we can continue to work together to make this world a better place.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you. </p><p> </p></div>","Dear friends and supporters,You might know me from my two previous campaigns 'Stephanie's Masai Education Fund' 1 + 2 with which I raised funds for our Masai community to receive training in land management and with which I distributed close to 300 reusable sanitary kits to the girl students and women of our community.Should you not know me: Hi, I am Stephanie, married to a Masai warrior and resident of the village of Lesoit, Kiteto, Tanzania for 7 years, where I work for the conservation of Masai culture and the environment they live in.With this campaign I would like to continue the work from my reusable sanitary kits project, with one major step towards sustainability: instead of buying the kits, I am now looking to teach the Masai women how to MAKE these kits.

We also believe that women are the changemakers in their communities and that their worldwide oppression is damaging to their communities.This is why I have decided to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in March 2019 with an international all-women's group. The trek is organised by an Australian organisation called 'Wanderlust Women's Adventures' (http://www.wanderlustwomensadventures.com) who organise sustainable travel giving back to local communities and especially women by providing reusable sanitary kits, education and small business incentives. With this trek, we hope to raise awareness of women's plights and the threats indigenous communities face worldwide.We appreciate your kindness and generosity and would like to reward you again with beautiful gifts in exchange for your donation.We offer Masai blankets, earrings, bracelets and beautifully beaded Masai sandals which is a new perk we introduced for this campaign. We also offer you the unique opportunity to come and stay with us in our traditional Masai home. Should your generous contributions push us over our goal, we will use these to fund more material for more kits.  This campaign does not fund a one-off improvement in the lives of the Masai. This campaign funds education and skills and capacity building which will last a lifetime. With this campaign, we guarantee a step towards sustainability to last for generations to come and which will ease the pressure the Masai face trying to sustain their traditional way of life.  I have come to love my husband's tribe - each and everyone of them is family to me. There is nothing I wish for more than to see this beautiful tribe survive the onslaught of modernity which has befallen it. I believe the Masai’s culture to be just as worthy of preservation as Africa’s natural heritage like lions and elephants - and I try with all that I do to help them find a balance between tradition and modernity for the sake of their tribal identity.So with this campaign, you are not only funding women empowerment and promoting gender equality. You are not only implementing sustainable development. You are helping safeguard our world's cultural heritage and one of our planet's last remaining indigenous tribes.  Please consider supporting us and please do spread the word about this campaign. Talk to your friends and family and feel free to share away. Check out my previous campaigns and my social media accounts and please get in touch if you have any questions or suggestions.I hope we can continue to work together to make this world a better place. Thank you.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Zen Maker Lab Inc. started as a group of engineers, designers, and entrepreneurs back in 2013 who enjoyed the maker/hacker culture and shared ideas about their personal projects.  We found our passion in demonstrating our creations to the local community, young and old, and in teaching the concepts behind how they worked.  Over the last seven years we've been conducting science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) programs across the Greater Vancouver Area encouraging students, staff, youth and parents to design, make, and play.  We had to pause our programs in schools and community centers for the time being because of COVID-19.  Our team was forced to pivot and begin working on a brand new project.</p>
<p><br/>The DesignMakePlay Pack was designed to bring the maker space home.  Students will be able to build exciting and technically innovative projects while they learn the science behind them.  This pack has 3 sets of materials to design, make, and play with and accompanying worksheets and videos that simplify intricate concepts and get kids excited.  This pack offers a total of 30 hours of STEAM learning content.  This pack will provide you and your kids with a fun and exciting experience you can enjoy at home.  Students can watch Zen Maker Lab’s videos and perform the activities at their own pace while illustrating real improvement through real projects and sharing their experience at the dinner table.  For any kids interested in engineering and arts, this is the perfect kit for you!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Most of the designs and curricular materials are ready to go!  We are looking to raise $5,000 for the production and shipping of our DesignMakePlay Pack to eager customers. The project kits and lessons are designed for kids in the age of 8-12, however, even adults will have fun with them!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will go towards furthering a world where every child can build and create using science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) safely from home.  Most jobs that exist today won't exist tomorrow and STEAM is important for getting kids prepared for a creative and innovative future.</p>
<p>The DesignMakePlay Pack keeps kids engaged in project based learning.  Our dream is to continue to inspire students to see what is possible when you apply the sciences in a fun and creative way. Your investment helps build that dream despite these tough times and allows us to continue to create content and deliver our programs.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are many STEAM kits and toys out there but many are lacking substance beyond a cool thing to build. We believe that the DesignMakePlay pack is better than anything out there now because we've included in-depth lessons around each kit and blend designing and playing into STEM in interesting ways.  We want kids to be innovative, creative and healthy in a way other STEAM projects don’t. Our kits are closely tied to the Canadian Curriculum.  We've invested time into reading through Canadian curriculums for every province across Canada and aim to provide lessons with our kits that can be effective for teaching concepts and terms relevant to students' education and grade level in school.</p>
<p>We want our kids' education to be relevant for their careers later in life which can be difficult to know.  Zen Maker Lab Inc. provides services to industry such as 3D design, PCB design, 3D printing, laser cutting, programming, prototyping and more.  This allows us to keep an active pulse on industry and know what's important for students in the future.  Our service work also introduces our team to new challenges and innovative ideas that inspire our projects.</p>

How maths applies to the real world</h3><p>Maths is initially an abstract subject that might seem irrelevant to everyday life. Maths problems however, clearly describe situations where maths skills are essential. This in turn encourages children to practice using maths to solve problems.</p><h3>2. Develop higher order thinking and critical thinking skills</h3><p>Word problems can be confusing because they contain extra information that may or may not be relevant to the question. Children are required to call upon a variety of skills simultaneously such as literacy, numeracy, imagination and critical thinking skills, to process this information, extract what’s relevant and use it to find the correct answer.</p><h3>3. Apply different maths concepts simultaneously</h3><p>Math word problems are also an effective way to teach children how to use different types of maths skills at the same time to solve a problem. For example a problem may require knowledge of algebra, fractions and multiplication in order to find the answer.</p><h3>4. Maths can be creative too</h3><p>For challenging math word problems, a child may need to approach them in a new way. When confronted with a new challenge, we are forced to search a bit harder for potential methods to a solution and this is a creative process. Bringing seemingly disparate skills and knowledge together forms new links in the brain, giving way to new ideas.</p><h3>5. Evaluate a child’s comprehension</h3><p>When a child begins to succeed at solving a particular kind of math word problem, it signals to the parent or teacher that they have understood the concepts involved. This provides a useful tool in determining a child’s progress and their level of confidence.</p><p> </p><h2>How to Play</h2><p>1.

L'associazione culturale Pro Art di Ferrara organizza per il 13 e 14 Giugno 2015 la prima edizione 
di Fecomics&games, la prima grande fiera del Comics, del Games, del Cosplay e del Japan nel centro storico di Ferrara. Le più belle piazze e i palazzi antichi della città ospiteranno spazi espositivi, incontri, workshop, presentazioni e spettacoli tutti dedicati al mondo del Comics in tutte le sue sfacettature. Insomma....un weekend magico avvolti nella nostra grande e bella città!


 
Sostieni Fecomics&games 2015!
Siamo alla nostra prima edizione e abbiamo bisogno di tutto il sostegno che riusciamo ad ottenere! Noi organizzatori principali, e il nostro Team che si occupa delle varie aree della fiera, stiamo lavorando moltissimo al solo scopo di realizzare un grande sogno...realizzare finalmente una grande e bella fiera del Comics nel centro storico di Ferrara! Sono in cantiere molti progetti e non passa giorno che qualche idea straordinaria ci venga in mente o ci venga proposta da altri. Ma purtroppo niente è senza costi e visto che la nostra intenzione è quella di crescere e di 
offrire sempre qualcosa di più ai visitatori della nostra fiera ci è venuto in mente di chiedere un piccolo aiuto ai nostri amici e sostenitori. Ci sono tante novità in fase di 
sviluppo. Seguiteci sui nostri profili per scoprirle: inanzitutto il nostro sito (www.fecomics.it) e poi la pagina Facebook , il profilo Twitter  e il profilo Instagram.Il testo stesso di 
questa campagna verrà continuamente aggiornato per presentare le cose su
 cui stiamo lavorando.
Aiutaci a realizzare un sogno!




Come verranno impiegate le donazioni?

Per sostenere le spese di una manifestazione sempre più importante, che
 però vuole cercare di rimanere per sempre ad ingresso gratuito, e per poter garantire un certo livellò di qualità abbiamo sempre più bisogno di sponsor e sostenitori che ci aiutino in questa impresa... titanica!
Nello specifico, tutti i fondi che riusciremo a raccogliere saranno così impiegati:

Ospitalità per i componenti delle associazioni senza scopo di lucro che saranno presenti alla nostra manifestazione e che ci aiuteranno a realizzare animazione nelle due giornate.

Migliorare le strutture per allestimenti ed impianti.

Poter offrire eventuali spettacoli e attività gratuite di buon livello.

Nella colonna qui a fianco trovate i simpatici gadget che 
abbiamo preparato appositamente per voi in cambio della vostra gentile donazione...un ricordo indelebile del vostro aiuto. 
Potete scoprirete meglio questi premi nel dettaglio in un'apposita sezione a 
fondo pagina (Descrizione Premi).Tutti i fondi raccolti con questa campagna saranno impiegati per la realizzazione dell'evento.Anche se non raggiungeremo l'obiettivo, la manifestazione si terrà comunque e impiegheremo al meglio il capitale raccolto....vi daremo il dettaglio di tutte le spese sotenute con le vostre offerte!

<div>Thanks for checking out our cause!  We hope you are as passionate as us about creating a future for Syrian refugees, especially its children.   Because of the conflict begun four years ago, most refugee children are going without basic education and missing years and years of school.  Where will these kids go when they are teenagers and adults?  How will they rebuild their country?</div>
<div>-</div>
<div>However, there are committed and passionate educators among the refugees who work tirelessly to protect the children's future.  One of these educators is Kayes Maddouh, a 25-year-old early career English teachers from central Syria.  <span style=""background-color: initial;""> I met Kayes when I went to Al-Salam School in Hatay, Turkey, a refugee school.  He showed great interest and initiative in developing as a teacher and using the best education methods, which wasn't part of the normal training that English teachers received in Syria.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">-</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Specifically, we're seeking to enroll Kayes in the CELTA (Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) course at International House - Izmir in Turkey.  Kayes will study intensively for one month where he will learn about topics such as linguistics, teaching methodology, and do plenty of practice teaching.  He will receive a certificate, which will enable him to seek employment outside of the refugee camps if necessary, and have the freedom to support himself and his family.  But he wishes to remain at Al-Salam and help the children.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">-</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">English skills will help the students reach the outside world; practically, it will help prepare them for careers in business, engineering or medicine; and on a more human level it will help them share their stories around the world.  Kayes is the type of teacher who can inspire kids and show them how to fulfill their potential in a dark and difficult situation.  </span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need $1500 to help supplement Kayes' savings for the total cost of completing the course (about $2100-2200).   It will go toward International House Izmir's tuition fees.  </p>
<p>YOU will receive for helping him:</p>
<p>- $10 donation - our beautiful ""The blessings of multiplicity are inevitable"" calligraphy artwork (created by an artist in Hatay) on a postcard from Turkey with a personalized thank you note</p>
<p>-$50-100 - ""The blessings of multiplicity are inevitable"" calligraphy artwork in medium-sized (5"" x 7"") with a handmade thank you card</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We say ""kids are the future,"" and in the case of Syria, nothing could be further from the truth.  Most funding for the crisis goes toward immediate aid such as medical care and food, but investing in education is also badly needed to save a generation of kids from falling prey to extremists and confusion in an increasingly fast-paced 21st century world.  </p>

-
However, there are committed and passionate educators among the refugees who work tirelessly to protect the children's future.  One of these educators is Kayes Maddouh, a 25-year-old early career English teachers from central Syria.   I met Kayes when I went to Al-Salam School in Hatay, Turkey, a refugee school.  He showed great interest and initiative in developing as a teacher and using the best education methods, which wasn't part of the normal training that English teachers received in Syria.

-
Specifically, we're seeking to enroll Kayes in the CELTA (Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) course at International House - Izmir in Turkey.  Kayes will study intensively for one month where he will learn about topics such as linguistics, teaching methodology, and do plenty of practice teaching.  He will receive a certificate, which will enable him to seek employment outside of the refugee camps if necessary, and have the freedom to support himself and his family.  But he wishes to remain at Al-Salam and help the children.
-
English skills will help the students reach the outside world; practically, it will help prepare them for careers in business, engineering or medicine; and on a more human level it will help them share their stories around the world.  Kayes is the type of teacher who can inspire kids and show them how to fulfill their potential in a dark and difficult situation.  
   What We Need & What You Get We need $1500 to help supplement Kayes' savings for the total cost of completing the course (about $2100-2200).   It will go toward International House Izmir's tuition fees.  
YOU will receive for helping him:
- $10 donation - our beautiful ""The blessings of multiplicity are inevitable"" calligraphy artwork (created by an artist in Hatay) on a postcard from Turkey with a personalized thank you note
-$50-100 - ""The blessings of multiplicity are inevitable"" calligraphy artwork in medium-sized (5"" x 7"") with a handmade thank you card
    The Impact We say ""kids are the future,"" and in the case of Syria, nothing could be further from the truth.  Most funding for the crisis goes toward immediate aid such as medical care and food, but investing in education is also badly needed to save a generation of kids from falling prey to extremists and confusion in an increasingly fast-paced 21st century world.

<p>As part of the
commitment to the mission of transforming lives, Safaricom provides it’s Staff
with an opportunity to identify live transforming initiatives across the
country and mobilize resources to implement them. Staff is provided with the
support and the opportunity to apply their expertise not only in their day to
day work assignments but also in avenues that provide channels of development
for the communities in which they exist. This is done by encouraging staff to
work with the community to identify projects that have a potential to catalyze
development and to work together with the community, partners and fellow
colleagues to implement them.</p>
<p>Many different
initiatives have been successfully implemented across different thematic
platforms through this support and partnership, all to the benefit of the
country. Such projects include provision of water to water scarce areas,
rehabilitation and building of learning facilities, provision of ICT facilities
among others. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>47
in 1 initiative</b> is one such project.  This initiative was conceptualized in 2014
September after a successful completion of yet another great initiative by
staff.  This is the biggest and most ambitious
Initiative Championed by staff in the company and led by Technology division.
The initiative aims to support primary education in kenya by bringing ICT enabled, solar
powered computer Labs to one primary school in each of the <b>47</b> counties in Kenya thereby providing centers of excellence in ICT
education access and information in these areas. </p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>Through the 47 in 1 initiative,

across the country by the end of year 2015</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Each lab is estimated to cost
approximately KShs. 1.6M. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The initiative will consist of 47
teams to match the 47 counties in the country who will champion the initiative
at county level and be responsible for all actions needed to deliver the
project. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>A central committee will be selected
from staff to co-ordinate the overall project plan and support teams with the
fundraising initiative. The central committee will be tasked to mobilize 50% 0f
the project cost, (800,000 per country) while the county team members mobilize
the remaining 50% needed to make the total cost 1.6M to implement a project.</p>

<br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Whereas ICT is now
an integral part of development our country and the world, many schools across
the country still do not have the privilege of accessing this important
resource. Unfortunately, most of these areas also lack basic learning
facilities that are necessary to ensure adequate learning such as books (text
and exercise) and electricity, to allow for more facilities to facilitate learning.
 E-learning materials can provide an
excellent resource and incentive to embrace ICT especially where physical
textbooks are in limited supply. </p>
<p>. It is therefore in this background that the
connected classroom project is engaging partners to provide ICT enabled
learning facilities to provide more opportunities to children especially in the remote areas in kenya</p>

<h2>sustainability management</h2>
<p>Sustainability is about whether
or not services, behaviors or practices continue to work and deliver benefits
over time. No time limit is set on those continued services, behavior changes
and outcomes. In other words, sustainability is about lasting benefits achieved
through the continued enjoyment of the positive change.</p>
<p>Sustaining a school’s computer
system involves more than just keeping the computers operating and repairing
them when they break down. Sustaining a school’s computer system also includes:
</p>

</div></div>","Summary Music education is my biggest passion in life. Because of my love for music, it pains me to watch people face setbacks in their musical endeavors as a result of financial hardships. My desire to provide opportunities for people from underprivileged circumstances is the motivating force behind my Indiegogo campaign.
A compassion for low income families coupled with my musical background make me the prime candidate to establish this Percussion Studio in Fort Worth, Texas.
At any given time, this Percussion Studio will accomodate between 60 and 100 students per week. At least one quarter of these students will receive free weekly lessons due to economic struggles.
Each week I will teach 20 one-on-one lessons as well as 20 group lessons with up to 10 students. In addition to weekly lessons, students will perform concerts throughout the year and compete in various competitions.   What We Need & What You Get 
The necessary funding amount is $50,000. This figure will cover the total costs of the facility and instruments.
The Impact
 The idea for this Percussion Studio stems from my compassion for at-risk families. During the summers between 2006 and 2011, I worked as a counselor at 3 different Boys and Girls Club of America locations. This job was my first opportunity to impact individuals with considerably underprivileged backgrounds. I immediately fell in love with this environment!
Unfortunately, many families suffer from poverty, and their lack of resources prevent them from realizing their true potential. Too many people have never been able to afford the necessary tools to cultivate their musical talents. I have witnessed this disappointing reality during my last seven years as a band director, and this is the reason I want to start my own Percussion Studio.
Percussion instruction, exposure to musical excellence, performance experience, contacts in the percussion world, and fountains of scholarships will be provided by the Percussion Studio, and all of these things will be within my students' reach with the help of Indiegogo funds.   Risks & Challenges This campaign can potentially face two significant challenges, but both of them can be overcome.
The first challenge will be recruiting students. As soon as my project is fully funded, I will actively begin seeking students who are interested in participating in the Percussion Studio. My people skills, flexible schedule, and connections with schools and churches will easily allow me to gain the maximum number of students.
In order to purposely recruit underprivileged students, I will partner with local school districts and churches to determine which students endure economic hardships at home. Then I will contact these students' families to inform them about this educational opportunity.

The second risk has to do with managing payments from the students who do not face substantial economic hardships. Luckily, my organization skills are sound, and I shouldn't have any trouble keeping track of my students' payments. In fact, Excel is my favorite computer program, and I have plenty of experience using Excel to manage financial information.
These are my Indiegogo campaign's two biggest challenges, but, as I've described above, they shouldn't create much of an obstacle in the way of my Percussion Studio's success.

The Photography and Imaging program is designed for beginning and advanced students; it is a rigorous combination of cultural, technical, and historical lectures; darkroom work; and critiques of student work. I will take part in the Photography and Imaging course, which would also provide me with 4 college credits. This course introduces students to 35 mm manual cameras, proper black-and-white film exposure, and darkroom printing, as well as color slide film, scanning, basic Photoshop, and digital color printing. Students are expected to photograph both during and outside of class hours. I will also take part in the Studies in Photo course, which would provide me with 2 credits. This course delves into the culture and history of the medium. Students will be assigned readings and visit galleries. All students will participate in critical discussions and written responses to lectures, readings, and visits.	This intense and enriching experience is significant to my photographic training and contributes immensely to my journey to becoming a professional.  I have never attended any class or received any formal education on photography but having being chosen among over 600 other applicants is itself an amazing accomplishment  and  I know I will gain a wealth in knowledge and experience if I were to attend.                                                This training is expensive and I won't be able to attend without aid financially. Tisch Summer High School Photography and Imaging Program costs a total of $10,873. This includes housing, meals, registration fees and program fees.  When we reach this goal in donated funds then we will use this money to pay for the program.  Additional funds raised will go towards buying a plane ticket. I was introduced to photography when I was 12 years old. Back then, I only had my backyard and a simple compact camera. Four years later, I'm more serious than ever about photography. I have been my own artist, model, assistant, critic and admirer for four years. I know I am prepared for this type of experience because everything I've accomplished in photography is a result of my hard work and dedication (and the help and support from countless others). I need your help to fund this next big step in my photography career so that I can continue to express everything I am capable of feeling through my photography, develop my artistic skills, and become a professional.Thank you for your consideration and support to sponsor me.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Every little bit helps and with enough people I believe that we can make this possible!If you aren't able to donate, you can still help by spreading the word! Please share my campaign on Facebook, email and tell your friends about it!Rewards:I appreciate every little contribution made to help me attend this program and fulfill my potential, so everyone who donates will receive a gift.  Everyone who contributes will be listed on this page if they like, with special listing for the higher amounts donated. Depending on the amount donated, sponsors will receive emails and other types of gratitude including cards, prints of your choice, and sessions with me. Immense gratitude is extended to all that contribute to reach this goal!If you are unable to donate or you would like to do even more to help, you can still participate and help me raise these funds by sharing this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, links or email.  The contest is based on how many funds are raised (contributions made) through your referrals. If you qualify for one of these rewards, make sure that I know the right contact information to be able to send it to you.The time period for this contest is from February 28 to March 14, 2015. Rewards will be given in April, 2015 after the campaign.Risks:Of course we all hope that nothing serious will rise up as an obstacle to this campaign and to stop me from accomplishing my goal, but things sometimes happen and I am willing to realize and address those things. One obvious obstacle is money. My family is not rich, but we do the best we can to afford education to pursue our goals and careers.  This fundraiser should help me to afford to attend this summer program and ensure that I can continue in my artistic training. If we are unable to reach the desired goal, funds will go to sending me to another summer program.

<p><b>Q: What is a
diorama?</b></p>
<p><span>A: A diorama is a three-dimensional replica of a landscape,
typically featuring habitat scenes. At The Field Museum, dioramas put visitors
face-to-face with environments and life from around the globe to create
powerful connections between people and nature.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Q: Why are dioramas important?</span></b></p>
<p><span>A:
Dioramas transport Museum visitors unlike any other medium, including
technology and other interactives, allowing immersive views into the natural
world. <span>The
Field Museum’s dioramas help educate the public and give access to environments
most people will never see in person.</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>Q: Why is the striped hyena a good animal to put
into a diorama?</span></b></p>
<p><span>A: At one point striped hyenas were abundant across northern
Africa and central Asia, but their current wild population is estimated to be
around 10,000 individuals. With habitat loss and range restrictions, their
numbers are decreasing annually. It is important to conserve these creatures in
their natural, Asian habitat for future generations.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Q: Are these new specimens?</span></b></p>
<p><span>A: No,
the four striped hyena specimens were brought to The Field Museum after an 1896
expedition. They were originally prepared by one of the pioneers of modern
taxidermy, Carl Akeley.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Q:
Why create a new diorama?</span></b></p>
<p><span>A:
Project Hyena Diorama aims not only to give them a new home in the Hall of
Asian Mammals, but also restore the specimens and give them new context and
surroundings.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Q: Why is the Museum crowdfunding Project Hyena
Diorama?</span></b></p>
<p><span>A: The Field Museum’s digital reach has never been stronger
than, or as extensive, as it is right now. As an institution, we are eager to
engage our viewers and fans from all over the world and help them become more
involved with projects happening in the Museum.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Q:
How can I help?</span></b></p>
<p><span>A: Donate and spread the word of #ProjectHyenaDiorama through
social media like Facebook and Twitter, email, and actual conversations.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Q: Can I donate offline?</span></b></p>
<p><span>A: Yes! Offline gifts can be sent directly to the Museum at <i>The Field Museum, Attn: Erin King, 1400 S. Lake

<p><b><span>Q:
Are gifts tax-deductible?</span></b></p>
<p><span>A: Yes! With each contribution, you will receive a donation acknowledgement email.<br/></span></p>
<p><b><span>Q: How does Project Hyena Diorama fit within The
Field Museum’s long-term goals?</span></b></p>
<p><span>A: The Museum aims to strengthen two core areas: scientific
excellence and the visitor experience. Project Hyena Diorama exemplifies this vision.
It combines collections research and conservation on these often misunderstood
creatures with the Museum’s historic habitat dioramas, enhanced by digital and
social media. We are proud The Brain Scoop team is leading the effort to engage
new audiences in the Museum’s core mission. We look forward to sharing the new
hyena diorama with our Indiegogo supporters and millions of visitors from
around the world at The Field Museum.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Q: What happens if we don’t raise all the money?</span></b></p>

</div></div>","Summary



My product Up the Ladder  (at http://theverbcompany.net) will provide a better way for millions of adults (and children) to learn to read English, using a new approach based on Linguistics and reading Finnish. I need funds to complete making the product. 
I grew up in Finland where children learn to read by the end of first grade although there is no subject of Spelling in school, nor Reading after the first grade. Finland ranks among the top countries in the world in terms of literacy as well as science and math education.  There is more time to study science and math because reading Finnish is so easy!
I am linguist (Ph.D.) doing research on adults learning to speak a new language, currently a visiting scholar at the Johns Hopkins University (Cognitive Science).  Reading is a real stumbling block for immigrants to the U.S., due to the complexity of English spelling.  

Three parts of my product, Up the Ladder, are ready.  I need funding to pay for the pictures, stories, and recordings for the remaining 5 parts.

What We Need & What You Get

 Each of the 8 parts of 'Up the Ladder' contains 10 short video lessons that can be watched on any platform. The student watches/listens to the lesson at their own pace.  Most lessons contain five 3-page stories that reinforce the concept of the lesson.

While I eventually hope to make money out of this endeavor, my goal at this time is to complete the product so it is available for use as soon as possible. This is why I am turning to Indiegogo for funding.  To complete Parts 4-8, I need funds for (total $1,640):

the pictures, $140 for one year of clipart
the stories, written by a teacher (200 stories, $5 each or $1,000)
recording each lesson ($10 a lesson, $500 for the 50 lessons)

If I don't raise the full amount, I will use what I get to pay for as many parts of 'Up the Ladder' as the funds will cover. 
A $25 donation will get you a copy of the full product to try out on anyone you know with reading problems.  
A $100 donation will earn you an individualized ""thank-you"" on The Verb Company web page, either in your name or in the name of someone else you choose, plus the full product.

The Impact 

In addition to immigrants learning English, this product is useful for:


native English-speaking adults who feel they never learned to read right
middle or high schoolers who have an IEP/are struggling readers


ESL students anywhere in the world (English is a world language!)

I believe the product would also be useful for children learning to read for the first time, and once the adult product is ready, I plan to move on to the child version.
By supporting this product, you will make it possible for teachers and learners of English to save countless hours of time.  Saving any amount of time in learning to read English will:

get immigrants to a paying job faster


reduce the amount of time and funding needed for Special Education and students with an IEP
reduce the time/money required to teach English in the developing world
once the child product is ready, the time saved in teaching reading can be used to increase math/science education, to improve the international rankings of the U.S.

While this is my first Indiegogo venture, I am familiar with completing big projects successfully, in particular researching and writing my 275-page dissertation, and the 2011 volume on the Acquisition of German that I coauthored with Martha Young-Scholten (culmination of years of research on the topic).  I am also a critical member of a big research project on Adult Second Language Acquisition of English at Newcastle University (England) run by my coauthor Martha Young-Scholten.  (Check my Wikipedia page on Organic Grammar!)
Risks & Challenges

 This is ultimately a huge project, with far-reaching ramifications.  
The main challenge would be giving up before reaping the benefits.  I feel so strongly about my approach, though, that I believe that one way or another I will get the adult version finished, and accessible to teachers. (One of my motives was to give back to society while working on something closely related to my passion, Linguistics.)
The other main challenge is getting my web page into a shape that will work well, including international versions.  I am planning to work on this after getting the product finished.
Finally, any money that I am able to make through the web page would go into making a child version of the product that K-2 elementary school teachers could use in teaching reading for the first time.

<p>Advanced surgical techniques and targeted

<p>Unfortunately, truly early detection remains
elusive for many malignancies. For example, a typical breast cancer patient has
had the disease for a decade by the time of diagnosis, due to mammography’s 70%
sensitivity rate. Although magnetic resonance imaging is more sensitive and
detects breast lesions much earlier than mammography, it is often prohibited by
high costs and lack of availability. High false positive and false negative
diagnosis further complicates therapy decisions or lead to unnecessary invasive
procedures at an <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2015/04/13/398818949/the-hidden-cost-of-mammograms-more-testing-and-overtreatment"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">annual cost of over 4 billion dollars</a>.</p>
<p>Our new, sensitive and specific non-invasive cancer diagnostic

before the patient has developed any symptoms and before current state of the

Martin & Nick - our scientists, have exceptionally broad experience in developing and applying computational methods to life sciences and drug discovery problems. Some of the projects that Martin and Nick have led are:


Why Are We Fundraising?
 
The funds that we raise will be used to:

Purchase several hundred urine  samples from patients diagnosed with breast cancer and dozens of samples from other cancers, as well as some “healthy” control samples. The samples are used to help us accurately and specifically classify breast cancer patients.
Process the samples to generate a complete metabolic data profile of each sample. These data profiles are used to create a mathematical model corresponding to a “disease fingerprint” of breast cancer, which accurately identifies breast cancer patients from patients afflicted with other types of cancer and disease-free individuals.
Run a blind clinical trial to independently confirm our results. We are presently working with St. Luke's Mountain States Tumor Institute	(MSTI) in Boise, Idaho. 


As scientists-entrepreneurs, we see our time as a necessary investment.
The funds will only be used towards buying and processing the urine samples
and a few ancillary expenses (such as shipping). We guarantee $0.95 of every donated
dollar will go directly towards sample acquisition and processing. These funds will not be used to pay ourselves salaries or living expenses.
To date, KMD Bio has
been completely self-funded. This campaign is the first time we are reaching
out asking for other people’s money. We are doing this,
because without additional funds it will take us several years to gather and
analyze the urine samples we need. 



With your help and contributions we will be able to develop the test in 6 to 9 months.

We chose crowdfunding over traditional private equity and venture funding paths, because in the early stage of development, we want to have the scientific and professional liberty to develop the technology without an overriding pressure to maximize profits.
When completed (we hope to be done in less than a year), KMD
will license the breast cancer test to any company that commits to make it
commercially available. We will make sure
that our test is not just acquired and buried to prevent it from competing with
existing products.

Why KMD Bio's Method?

 

Advanced surgical techniques and targeted
therapies offer the possibility that cancer may one day become a manageable
disease. But this will only be possible if the cancer is detected early in its
course while it is still treatable.
Unfortunately, truly early detection remains

high costs and lack of availability. High false positive and false negative
diagnosis further complicates therapy decisions or lead to unnecessary invasive
procedures at an annual cost of over 4 billion dollars.
Our new, sensitive and specific non-invasive cancer diagnostic

before the patient has developed any symptoms and before current state of the
art diagnostic tests can detect it. It also is able to distinguish between
different cancer stages (i.e. stage I vs stage III or stage IV), adding needed
information to further treatment options. This will have tremendous impact on
survival rates and healthcare costs.

The hard science work done at the Scripps Center for Matabolomics is a direct validation of the KMD Metabolomics and Bioinformatics approach.

<p><b>The
African American Music Association, Inc. (AAMA)</b> was

and perform the music. The AAMA is a tax-exempt, 501(c) (3) entity. It is
organized exclusively for charitable, cultural and educational purposes. Its
primary goal is to offer programs and activities to the community that will
assure a better quality of life for persons pursuing performing arts as a
career or a vocation. The “total well-being” of the artist, through human and
personal development is the overall goal.</p>

<p>The
AAMA made it possible for many local performing artists to display their
talents through concerts, street festivals, talent shows, and various other
kinds of community-based cultural arts activities. </p>
<p>Some of
the projects that the AAMA produce and facilitate in the District of Columbia
include:</p>
<p><b>Corporate Neighborhood Youth Project </b>- The Corporate Neighborhood Youth Project specifically targets youth and 
families who live in Ward 7 &amp; 8, and extends a solution based program of 
advocacy, health promotions, counseling, social and emotional 
development that will produce a cadre of young people who are conscious,
 community-oriented, responsible and accountable as leaders for the next
 generation.  A production of a musical CD with positive 
reinforcing lyrics is the capstone product produced from this youth 
development program using music and the arts to attract challenged and 
disadvantaged youth for positive change and advocates of the same.<br/></p>

Our foundational belief is that nurses are the grassroots workers for communal health; and as such are the grassroots workers for peaceful, just societies. </p>
<p>Our current campaign is to support a conference between East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Jerusalem area nurses. The subject of the conference is ""Across Borders: Long-Term Patient Follow Up between Israel and Palestine.""</p>
<p>This conference will be the first of it's kind in Jerusalem, and has the potential to change the way nurses between the two lands communicate with each other after a patient has been moved over borders. The impact factor not only involves hundreds of nurses, but thousands of patients and their families who will benefit from a coordinated effort by Israeli and Palestinian nurses. Simultaneously, meeting, working together, and creating solutions for patient follow up will enable nurses to gain better understandings of each other on a social and political level. </p>

Step 4 — Start writing a rough draft to have ready by June 2016. (We're aiming to make a grade 9-12 textbook — in a year.)Step 5 — Send out rough draft versions to students, educators, and administrators to praise or lambast.  (We have thick skin.)Step 6 — Edit the books so that (almost) everyone is happy. (We don't want people falling asleep because of what they're reading.)Step 7 — Finalize our outreach program. (The more schools that know, the better. Plus, we'll have a final product by this time.)Step 8 — Release the book. (This should be ready by June 2017, because many educators lesson plan during the summer.)1 — Donate a $1. Seriously. If every person donates just one dollar, we could create more than one textbook. 2 — Spread the word. There's a video at the top of this page you're free to share. Post this on your friends' walls, tweet directly to them, email it to them. They're more likely to do something if you contact them directly. 3 — Write about this project, or get someone you know to write about it, too. Bloggers and social media experts are perfect for this. They have audiences and those audiences help bring attention to the cause.4 — Do all three of these things. We like overachievers.If you're still reading by this point you're either (A) incredibly interested or (B) really avoiding your work. Either way, here are some questions that you might have and their accompanying answers.Where does the money go?It goes to paying people to write, edit, and design the book. Creating one textbook is expensive, but we're trying to make a grade 9-12 literature/English textbook here. How can I get in on a potential opportunity for working on this project?The easiest way to get noticed is to contribute to the project via a $10 perk. That option allows you to name drop yourself or someone else for a position. We'll also post updates about positions when we're hiring. Everyone is welcome to apply. By giving to this project, we're looking to give back to people in the form of freelance work and, of course, sweet, sweet, dough.What if you don't raise enough money?Depending on how much we raise, we'll either (A) stash the money away in a secret lair and revisit our campaign strategy, (B) stay the course and use inventive techniques to complete the project, or (C) find out where you live, knock on your door while holding kittens and puppies with sad eyes, and ask you for money.What if you raise more than you need?Again, this depends on how much we raise. However, as a general rule, assume that for every $500,000 we raise, we'll try to create another free textbook, such as a core math or science class. Maybe we'll even create a few accompanying apps. If you have ideas and suggestions please let us know via Facebook or Twitter.This campaign story is close to receiving a tl;dr title. What do you plan to do about that?End it here.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>
<p><b>Introducing <strong>FresHires: </strong>the innovative new job discovery and self branding platform dedicated to <strong>revolutionizing the way today’s young job seekers connect with career opportunities and build their futures.</strong>   </b></p>
<p>My
 name is Yinka. I am an Entrepreneur, Petro-Chemical Process Engineer 
and Business Analyst. I am passionate about Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics as well as the career development of the 
rising young professional. I have created the FresHires platform to help
 other rising young professionals who are going through a very tough 
time finding the perfect opportunity for their internships, part time or
 full time jobs after college graduation.</p>
<p><b>My Motivation      </b></p>
<p>The
 FresHires project was launched based on my personal experience. Having 
studied in the United States, England and Nigeria with 2 Master’s 
degrees (Petroleum Engineering from the UK and Chemical Engineering in 
the USA), I still could not get hired. Most companies would not even 
extend the opportunity to showcase the skills or experience I’ve had 
over the years either from the college environment or an internship. 
During this period, I was really disturbed and depressed. I started 
thinking more of being a solution than being part of the problem that 
arises from unemployment among rising young professionals. </p>
<div>

<p>While
 I was waiting for the ‘perfect’ opportunity, I worked as a call center 
agent being paid about $8/hr for few months before the call center was 
shut down. This heightened my frustration as an Engineering graduate. I 
actually wrote to some Human resources department of different companies
 asking work in an unpaid volunteer position. Sadly, no one would 
oblige. I decided to travel down to Houston TX (the oil and gas city) to
 find a job. I interviewed with some companies, most of these companies 
would not send a response to explain the outcome of the interview. I 
called in severally and would be told not to contact them again, as they
 would send me a notification once decision was made. Up until this 
moment, I have not received a response. I spoke to a lot of people 
trying to find a job to know more about their personal experience and 
strangely, they were very similar to mine. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The Turning Point        </b></p>
<p>At
 that moment, I decided something needed to be done to help people like 
me who were going through the same experience (Graduated College and no 
one would hire you either as an intern, volunteer or full time 
position). I got a job in Houston in a large apparel, hunting and 
fishing store, unloading trucks and stocking shelves. Honestly, I would 
relish an opportunity to work for any engineering firm even if I would 
be paid the same rate I was being paid for stocking up footwear on 
shelves.    </p>
<p>I
 called up my friend -Olu, whom I've known for 14 years (now
 FresHires Co-founder) to share the FresHires idea with him knowing that
 he had been in a similar predicament a few years earlier. We decided to
 put our hearts to work and create a platform to change the face of 
hiring of college students, university students, fresh graduates with 
little or no work experience as well as professionals with some 
experience looking to change jobs.</p>
<p>Companies
 hire not solely based on work experience but also because of GREAT 
SKILLS. Great skills that proffer solutions to company needs exemplify 
our self brand and this is exactly what FresHires is all about.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Job search platforms are nothing new, of course: but from LinkedIn to Internmatch, today’s job search platforms fall short of the mark when it comes to equipping today’s highly educated, qualified and motivated young job seekers with the tools and opportunities they need to make the leap from the sheltered world of school to the wide world of career and professional development.  </p>
<p><strong>FresHires is here to change the career development game once and for all. </strong>Combining everything from self-branding and networking to mentoring and career guidance to job search and job match into one streamlined platform, <strong>FresHires is paving the way to the future for job seekers around the world.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Get Seen, Get Hired </strong><br/>With students and graduates showcasing their unique skills and branding themselves with our unique multi-media profiles, recruiters and prospective employers can then browse job seekers' profiles and see at a glance what that person will bring to their team. </p>

<p><strong>Dedicated Chat Rooms</strong><br/>Our network of mentors, counselors, educators, life coaches, career coaches, recruiters and companies utilize our dedicated chat rooms to host personal, private interactions with our students and graduates, both in groups and one-on-one. Students and graduates can also create customized chat rooms on academic topics or events happening on their campuses and in their communities. </p>

<h3>Mobile App Portfolio</h3>
<p>FresHires is still in the early stages of development -- like our users are in the early stage sof their career. But like with our users, all signs point to bigger and better things to come! </p>
<p>Development of the FresHires mobile app for smartphone and other mobile devices is well underway. This will give users the chance to update their profile wherever and whenever they are. </p>

<h3>
<b>Our strategy/approach</b>: </h3>
<p>To
 work directly with college/university career center to help with 
campaigning FresHires to both students and alumni community by 
participating in career fairs. We plan to give internship and paid 
employment opportunities to current college students who would serve as 
college ambassador for FresHires in their respective schools. These 
FresHires ambassadors would serve as point of contact and provide 
information and assistance to other students who are seeking to know 
about FresHires and also require support to use the platform. The ideal 
FresHires ambassadors would be a student who is interested in 
technology, meeting people, and helping people use technology to achieve
 something of value.  We would pay our ambassadors from the funds that 
we raise.  We hope to be able to hire students from different colleges 
and universities and provide them valuable work experience that would 
come in handy on their FresHires Academic Portfolio and Personal 
Resumes.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We
 have been bootstrapping this project since June 2013. Inadequate 
resources and funding has hindered us from being able to deliver this 
project as fast as we wanted. Despite the fact, that we have been 
running this project by the two of us for a very long time, we have 
built two prototype versions of this website and now we are almost 
perfecting the version 1.0 of the main website and that of the mobile 
app which we will like to make available for free downloads in Google 
and iTunes Stores by May 2015.</p>
<p>We
 desire to reach over 22 Million college and university students in the 
United States of America and this can only be achieved through adequate 
resources. Our goal is to hire college students on-campus to work for 
the FresHires Corporation as brand ambassadors, We believe the 
opportunity to work for our company will be a great step forward in 
helping these rising young professionals gain work experience.</p>
<p>We
 still have about 5 new features to add to our web and app products that
 will immensely impact the FresHires online community of students, 
graduates, recruiters,life coaches, career coaches, educators, 
counselors and companies. We can not add these features yet due to 
inadequate funds.</p>
<p>We
 sincerely hope that this crowdfunding process will help us bring to 
life the products and services that will help make our world a better 
place for all of us.</p>
<p><br/></p>

The Story


Introducing FresHires: the innovative new job discovery and self branding platform dedicated to revolutionizing the way today’s young job seekers connect with career opportunities and build their futures.   
My
 name is Yinka. I am an Entrepreneur, Petro-Chemical Process Engineer 
and Business Analyst. I am passionate about Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics as well as the career development of the 
rising young professional. I have created the FresHires platform to help
 other rising young professionals who are going through a very tough 
time finding the perfect opportunity for their internships, part time or
 full time jobs after college graduation.

degrees (Petroleum Engineering from the UK and Chemical Engineering in 
the USA), I still could not get hired. Most companies would not even 
extend the opportunity to showcase the skills or experience I’ve had 
over the years either from the college environment or an internship. 
During this period, I was really disturbed and depressed. I started 
thinking more of being a solution than being part of the problem that 
arises from unemployment among rising young professionals.

me who were going through the same experience (Graduated College and no 
one would hire you either as an intern, volunteer or full time 
position). I got a job in Houston in a large apparel, hunting and 
fishing store, unloading trucks and stocking shelves. Honestly, I would 
relish an opportunity to work for any engineering firm even if I would 
be paid the same rate I was being paid for stocking up footwear on 
shelves.    
I
 called up my friend -Olu, whom I've known for 14 years (now
 FresHires Co-founder) to share the FresHires idea with him knowing that
 he had been in a similar predicament a few years earlier. We decided to
 put our hearts to work and create a platform to change the face of 
hiring of college students, university students, fresh graduates with 
little or no work experience as well as professionals with some 
experience looking to change jobs.
Companies
 hire not solely based on work experience but also because of GREAT 
SKILLS. Great skills that proffer solutions to company needs exemplify 
our self brand and this is exactly what FresHires is all about.

Job search platforms are nothing new, of course: but from LinkedIn to Internmatch, today’s job search platforms fall short of the mark when it comes to equipping today’s highly educated, qualified and motivated young job seekers with the tools and opportunities they need to make the leap from the sheltered world of school to the wide world of career and professional development.  
FresHires is here to change the career development game once and for all. Combining everything from self-branding and networking to mentoring and career guidance to job search and job match into one streamlined platform, FresHires is paving the way to the future for job seekers around the world.


Here's a quick overview of just a few of the features that make FresHires unlike any career development platform available today: 
Brand Yourself FresHires allows our users to showcase their individual brands, unque skills, talents and abilities with dynamic, engaging multi-media profiles that integrate images, video and narrative elements. 

Get Connected - and Stay Connected FresHires combines social, academic and professional networking into onestreamlined environment, so users can stay plugged into their social media life while developing meaningful relationships and professional skills at the same time. 

Get Seen, Get Hired With students and graduates showcasing their unique skills and branding themselves with our unique multi-media profiles, recruiters and prospective employers can then browse job seekers' profiles and see at a glance what that person will bring to their team. 
​
FresHires Job BoardThe FresHires Job Board is where recruiters and companies of all shapes and sizes can post jobs specifically suited to students, interns, graduates and young professionals just starting out on their career journey.

Volunteer OpportunitiesFresHIres also features a volunteer job board where  businesses can support and promote volunteer jobs that give rising young professionals the chance to build their resumes and their communities at the same time. 
​
FresHires NetworkFresHires is the ultimate community for young job seekers. Students and graduates can interact, connect and develop relationships that matter. The FresHires network also includes mentors, counselors, educators, life coaches, career coaches, recruiters and companies that can provide young job seekers with invaluable advice that will help them on their road to career success.            
Dedicated Chat RoomsOur network of mentors, counselors, educators, life coaches, career coaches, recruiters and companies utilize our dedicated chat rooms to host personal, private interactions with our students and graduates, both in groups and one-on-one. Students and graduates can also create customized chat rooms on academic topics or events happening on their campuses and in their communities. 


Mobile App Portfolio
FresHires is still in the early stages of development -- like our users are in the early stage sof their career. But like with our users, all signs point to bigger and better things to come! 
Development of the FresHires mobile app for smartphone and other mobile devices is well underway. This will give users the chance to update their profile wherever and whenever they are. 
 





Our strategy/approach: 
To
 work directly with college/university career center to help with 
campaigning FresHires to both students and alumni community by 
participating in career fairs. We plan to give internship and paid 
employment opportunities to current college students who would serve as 
college ambassador for FresHires in their respective schools. These 
FresHires ambassadors would serve as point of contact and provide 
information and assistance to other students who are seeking to know 
about FresHires and also require support to use the platform. The ideal 
FresHires ambassadors would be a student who is interested in 
technology, meeting people, and helping people use technology to achieve
 something of value.  We would pay our ambassadors from the funds that 
we raise.  We hope to be able to hire students from different colleges 
and universities and provide them valuable work experience that would 
come in handy on their FresHires Academic Portfolio and Personal 
Resumes.






Risks and challenges

We
 have been bootstrapping this project since June 2013. Inadequate 
resources and funding has hindered us from being able to deliver this 
project as fast as we wanted. Despite the fact, that we have been 
running this project by the two of us for a very long time, we have 
built two prototype versions of this website and now we are almost 
perfecting the version 1.0 of the main website and that of the mobile 
app which we will like to make available for free downloads in Google 
and iTunes Stores by May 2015.
We
 desire to reach over 22 Million college and university students in the 
United States of America and this can only be achieved through adequate 
resources. Our goal is to hire college students on-campus to work for 
the FresHires Corporation as brand ambassadors, We believe the 
opportunity to work for our company will be a great step forward in 
helping these rising young professionals gain work experience.
We
 still have about 5 new features to add to our web and app products that
 will immensely impact the FresHires online community of students, 
graduates, recruiters,life coaches, career coaches, educators, 
counselors and companies. We can not add these features yet due to 
inadequate funds.
We
 sincerely hope that this crowdfunding process will help us bring to 
life the products and services that will help make our world a better 
place for all of us.


    Other Ways You Can Help You can help us share our fundraising link on you social media accounts.  Kindly Help Spread the word among students, professors, counselors, mentors, life coaches, career coaches, company executives, recruiters and parents.

Also, you can help us out by using Paypal as your form of payment for those that have a Paypal account. This will reduce service charges on the total amount contributed. Thanks.

<p><span>I am an undergraduate freshman at EARTH University Costa Rica (<a href=""http://www.earth.ac.cr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.earth.ac.cr/</a>).

with university entry points. However, this was not an easy pursuit because my
family could not pay for my college education, just as they could not pay for
my high school education. In high school my education was primarily funded by
bursaries, grants and well-wishers. Unfortunately, it was difficult to find
college aid. Four years after my graduation I was blessed to win a MasterCard

<p><span>The rate of school dropouts in my community falls above 60% for every group of students that start schooling together. The factors contributing to this are primarily caused by the unfriendly conditions my community holds. With every family living below the poverty line, no one is able to afford the school fees when their children enroll in high schools. Additionally, the poor learning environment perpetuates the cycle of
poor performance.  </span></p>
<p>When I received my scholarship last May, I was doing voluntary
tutoring in my community’s primary school. Since everyone in my community dreams of studying
abroad, I used my story to encourage the students to see the opportunities and
potential they too hold.</p>Because of this, 20 students graduated with very good grades from the primary school and were all admitted to high school.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Most of these students are being forced out of school because of

<b>EducationHOPE </b>is an initiative created by two students at EARTH University student with support from two school directors, with the aim of giving back to their communities and and helping extend resources and opportunities to other communities just as they have been privileged to get them at EARTH, and impact many other more lives. Being from very financially devastated social backgrounds, the students have faced substantive obstacles to achieve their dreams of getting education and their struggle is the call they have had to remember the communities. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">They are all from rural villages where poverty and its related

<p><span>With this campaign, we wish to begin by helping 20 students from a village located around the Lake Victoria region in Western Kenya. The students, already enrolled in high school, need $600 every year to stay in school. </span></p>
<p>This is why we need you.</p>
<p> With $600, every child gets all that he needs to stay in
school for a whole year without the stress of being sent out of school. This will
include;</p>
<p>            ·School tuition for
the year</p>
<p>             ·Accommodation
in the school residences for the year</p>
<p>             · Food</p>
<p>             · Books and
revision materials</p>
<p>             · A little
monthly stipend</p>
<p>Your support is important to these students.</p>
<p>We intend to directly send all the money raised to the school
account in collaboration with the school principal. We believe all donations
are relevant, therefore, all money will be sent whether or not our goal is met. </p>
<p></p>

</div><div>
<h3>Why is Your Contribution Important?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>The community we are working to change is one that has had a very negative school enrollment and very huge numbers of dropouts. In fact, only one has managed to get into the university (David, the founder EducationHOPE). Among the factors, the main one is the poverty levels that are so high in this community, literally every household lives on less than $1 every day. So many students cannot go to school because their families cannot afford to pay their school fees, a necessity since education has to be paid for by students in Kenyan high schools.</span></p>

<p><span>Imagine the impact you are creating not only for the students but for their families and also their communities. Educating one child can change the world, but you are going beyond this with your support to create a motivation, show a possibility and beyond all this, building a future for someone whom without you cannot make it.</span></p>
<p><span>With your support, these students will forget the trouble and worry of being sent out of school and instead peacefully stay in school just like their fellow students.</span></p>

<div>
<div><b>About Majimbo</b></div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><span>Majimbo, a little island located in the northeastern part of Lake Victoria in the western part of Kenya just next to Uganda is approximately 5km<sup>2</sup>. In a distance, beauty shines to its maximum. In fact it is one of the best places to watch the breathtaking scenery of sunsets in the Western horizon in Kenya; the reflection of the burning skies by the Lake in the evenings presents an amazement of nature. It is one of these regions on earth with some of the best smiles I have ever seen in my life.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the abundance of life of nature in Majimbo, an agony is rooted deep in the lifestyles of the people it hosts. Within this hidden beauty, a hidden story lies. Stories of great yearning and need although in ignorance, a life lived without a hope of a tomorrow although a knowledge of its existence. A daily life with no electricity, no cars or motorbikes, no clean water, no system for waste and sewage (which crazily pollutes the water where their livelihood, the tilapia and the Nile perch, comes from), there is no trust in one another, no shoes, no lunches and no decent clothes for the kids, they wear some dirty and ready-to-retire uniforms that have been in circulation for longer than the wildly fluctuating Kenyan Shilling. Shacks are built of manure or corrugated iron sheets and randomly found-and-resurrected bits and bobs. There are about two bicycles (from a different century), dirt tracks that get flooded and impossible to go through after a big rain, there is HIV left and right, polygamy and widow-inheritance which, of course plays the biggest role in the spread of HIV, there are qualified but frustrated and unmotivated teachers who will wonder for the rest of their days why they spent so much money and time on college when they will never make it back unless they become headmasters and will be in the position to play with government and charity money.  (Imagine the impact of this on educating the kids). There are some wild ideas on life and existence, there are some very unusual beliefs, rituals, customs (some of which only contribute to the health issues), there is no motivation, there are no ideas or inspiration and if there is a spark of inspiration, there is no one to implement the ideas. Most people dream only about simple survival. Imagination is nearly dead. Everything stands still, frozen in time.</span></p>
<p><span>Each day passes and as time goes the exact definition of Majimbo´s contents of life rarely defines itself; for of reality, a harsher condition of life continues to dominate. On average seven out of ten students who enroll in the community primary school drop out before graduating, and out of those who graduate, very few of them join high schools due to poor performances and the incapacity to afford high school education... None of the girls in this community are educated. They either drop out of school as young as 15 to get married to fellow teens who are dropouts too or get pregnant somewhere on the way before reaching grade 8. Without education, a future is not created, a community is under extinction and this is what this community faces. Among these factors, comes HIV/AIDS which has impacted this community so negatively; ranging from reduced labor to loss of lives each time. Not ignoring the agony of this deadly disease, the people contribute to its spread although in ignorance but in the name of cultural practice and customs which illiteracy highly contributes to. Widow inheritance, polygamy and not observing AIDS prevention mechanisms especially with self-care in matrimonial lives.  The effects of these factors and the disease itself continue to live in this community and possibly forever if something is not done. I would take a moment to imagine 10 years from now and think about all the 10-15 year old children, if we do not take them to school, this is the lifestyle they will be living; all will be married with at least two children or two wives or would have married more than two wives of whom they will be living with none of them. This means that at least 60% of them to more than 70% of the youths in Majimbo today will have HIV/AIDS. They will also be working so hard fishing in the dangerous Lake Victoria to feed their families. If the reverse happens and all of them go to school, maybe only a few of them will be married, the probability that any of them will be HIV/AIDS positive will be highly reduced, none of them will be in the lake fishing but rather in school looking for opportunities and possibly just as I do, at least some of them will be out there in the world looking for opportunities for this community to make it better.</span></p>
<p><span>Out of Majimbo this year something unusual happened, it is surprising! Since when I got out of high school in 2011, only two have been admitted after me. All who have managed to graduate from high school after me did not join high school, either for financial or performance reasons. This year more than 20 students performed well and were admitted to high schools. This in a very great manner was contributed to by the motivation I gave the students while in school, after winning a MasterCard Foundation Scholarship to study abroad. Out of those who graduated with good grades are two girls who because they could not afford their school, one decided to run away from her home and get married while the other is now pregnant; both aren´t in school. The rest of the students who are now all admitted to Got Agulu Secondary School, the nearest high school in Majimbo has one major worry; how they will be able to stay in school until they graduate and how will they achieve their dreams after this long struggle. The bottom-line is the amazing motivation they have had to generate to overcome the demanding and harsh conditions to graduate from primary school with good marks and grades. This is reason enough to paint the picture of the kind of determination and passion in the minds of each of these students. They are all from very poor family backgrounds with some of them being orphans while others literally have to also work with their parents to enable them to at least get a single meal in a day. By this, they literally have not enough time to study as day-scholars and with the conditions, a number of them are forced to miss even school. Already, even after only staying in school for two months, most of them have been forced to stay out of school because of the huge outstanding fee balances they already have yet their families cannot afford to pay. These students represent an array of diversity and varied conditions that although related are very different. </span></p>

<p>16-year-old Edward Mahala is the only child of a young couple who died just six years after the birth of their son. The couple who later died of HIV/AIDS after the young Edward was able to walk around the yard and enjoy the life of every toddler luckily did not infect their baby with the disease but the effect of their absence was felt just immediately after the father who died a year after the mother was just taken back to the soil. No one despite knowing the real need the young innocent Edward needed was ready to take him in to take care of him; the reason being the huge stigma this deadly disease held at that time. Indeed the grandmother with whom he lives today says that not even his uncles were ready to hear his story, they would literally evade it if they had to hear the name Edward. The poor little Edward was too innocent even to guess this. Two days later after all the people were to get back to their homes as the Luo culture demands after the burial of the dead, the grandmother took the little boy. She did not know how she was going to take care of him although she says she was in love with the angel after no one else was ready. She does not have a husband and two of her children are also suffering from this deadly disease. She did not have a job but largely depended on the help from the elder son who owns a boat at the lake. She was ready to share the little help she would always receive. Edward has since then grown into a boy ready to make her grandmother proud but still he cannot pay his school fees, neither can his grandmother.<br/></p>

<p><span>From a very early stage in his life, he was outstanding and his level of curiosity would make him stand out.

During his stay in his primary school, every teacher was impressed with his ability to lead, discipline and level of maturity even at that young age.</span></p>
<p><span>John is a fourteen-year-old boy from a very humble background. His father who is now 87 years old never had an opportunity to even go midway through the elementary school and neither did the mother have an opportunity to step into the elementary school class. Subsequently, never did his parents make any savings for him or for his two elder brothers to take them to school. With his good performance, he received an admission to one of the provincial schools in the region but because of financial problems he could not get in but went to the cheaper school near home where he could stay as a day-scholar.</span></p>
<p><span>John has two brothers, the elder who after doing his high school exams did not do very well and seven years later still does not have a job. The other just got a scholarship to study outside the country after having taken his exam in 2011.

<p><span>Nicholas is the first born of a very young couple who live on donated land so far apart separated from their ancestral home. His grandfather separated from what they call a family and so they are today. Neither of his parents ever went to school and they get their daily bread from fishing which in reality no longer has value in Majimbo. From the early stages in their lives Nicholas and his other five siblings have had to miss school to fish and also in a manner take part in the maintenance of the family. Even before starting school, Nicholas was a ¨professional¨ when it comes to fishing as he would always accompany his father any moment the mother was not in a position to do so. This has made him and his siblings miss a lot of days in school. None of his parents take the education of the children serious and the motivation that each of the children has is what keeps them moving along the academic path. In fact, one of his cousins already dropped out of school to help in the family upkeep while the brother had to repeat grade 8 this year because the parents could not afford to pay for their studies.</span></p>
<p><span>This boy has a unique dream. In fact, judging from the family conditions he has grown up from he would not even know of surgery but when asked what he wants to be, he says he wants to study to become a surgeon and help those people who want operations.</span></p>

<br/>
</div></div>","It is estimated that around 10 million children in sub-Saharan Africa  drop out of school every year. One of the major reasons is because their families cannot afford to pay for their education. We are here to create a change and assist every rural child to stay in school, but we need you.

I am an undergraduate freshman at EARTH University Costa Rica (http://www.earth.ac.cr/). I was born and raised in Kenya, in a fishing community along the northeastern shores of Lake Victoria where poverty, illiteracy and a yearning for a better life dominates. I am the first person ever to go through high school and graduate
with university entry points. However, this was not an easy pursuit because my
family could not pay for my college education, just as they could not pay for
my high school education. In high school my education was primarily funded by
bursaries, grants and well-wishers. Unfortunately, it was difficult to find
college aid. Four years after my graduation I was blessed to win a MasterCard
Foundation Scholarship to study at EARTH University. Knowing someone believed
in me was an amazing feeling.

The rate of school dropouts in my community falls above 60% for every group of students that start schooling together. The factors contributing to this are primarily caused by the unfriendly conditions my community holds. With every family living below the poverty line, no one is able to afford the school fees when their children enroll in high schools. Additionally, the poor learning environment perpetuates the cycle of
poor performance.  
When I received my scholarship last May, I was doing voluntary
tutoring in my community’s primary school. Since everyone in my community dreams of studying
abroad, I used my story to encourage the students to see the opportunities and
potential they too hold.Because of this, 20 students graduated with very good grades from the primary school and were all admitted to high school.Most of these students are being forced out of school because of
outstanding school fee balances.They are the change in this community and they have shown an incredible motivation, determination and burning energy to be different by going to school instead of going to the lake to fish. My primary goal is to provide them with the opportunity to be the change
my community has been so desperate for.

The magnitude of impact Education can provide for my community is
immeasurable. Educating a child in a community dominated by illiteracy,
poverty, ignorance, HIV/AIDS, teen pregnancies, poor sanitation and sewage
systems, can start the cycle of change. I want to be this catalyst for change
in a community that means so much to me. Educating children in such a poverty-ridden
community creates a positive effect far beyond the children directly helped. With your help,
a hope is built, a new horizon of opportunity is created for the children and
the community, a change to a better world begins.




The Initiative





EducationHOPE is an initiative created by two students at EARTH University student with support from two school directors, with the aim of giving back to their communities and and helping extend resources and opportunities to other communities just as they have been privileged to get them at EARTH, and impact many other more lives. Being from very financially devastated social backgrounds, the students have faced substantive obstacles to achieve their dreams of getting education and their struggle is the call they have had to remember the communities. They are all from rural villages where poverty and its related
problems are so dominant. That is why many children born from these communities
don´t get to school and if they do, they drop out so soon. They want to show
possibility and enable dreams.
    What We Need & What We Get 
With this campaign, we wish to begin by helping 20 students from a village located around the Lake Victoria region in Western Kenya. The students, already enrolled in high school, need $600 every year to stay in school. 
This is why we need you.
 With $600, every child gets all that he needs to stay in
school for a whole year without the stress of being sent out of school. This will
include;
            ·School tuition for
the year
             ·Accommodation
in the school residences for the year
             · Food
             · Books and
revision materials
             · A little
monthly stipend
Your support is important to these students.
We intend to directly send all the money raised to the school
account in collaboration with the school principal. We believe all donations
are relevant, therefore, all money will be sent whether or not our goal is met. 



Why is Your Contribution Important?

The community we are working to change is one that has had a very negative school enrollment and very huge numbers of dropouts. In fact, only one has managed to get into the university (David, the founder EducationHOPE). Among the factors, the main one is the poverty levels that are so high in this community, literally every household lives on less than $1 every day. So many students cannot go to school because their families cannot afford to pay their school fees, a necessity since education has to be paid for by students in Kenyan high schools.

Imagine the impact you are creating not only for the students but for their families and also their communities. Educating one child can change the world, but you are going beyond this with your support to create a motivation, show a possibility and beyond all this, building a future for someone whom without you cannot make it.
With your support, these students will forget the trouble and worry of being sent out of school and instead peacefully stay in school just like their fellow students.
Help us make the difference


The Story. 

About Majimbo


Majimbo, a little island located in the northeastern part of Lake Victoria in the western part of Kenya just next to Uganda is approximately 5km2. In a distance, beauty shines to its maximum. In fact it is one of the best places to watch the breathtaking scenery of sunsets in the Western horizon in Kenya; the reflection of the burning skies by the Lake in the evenings presents an amazement of nature. It is one of these regions on earth with some of the best smiles I have ever seen in my life.
Despite the abundance of life of nature in Majimbo, an agony is rooted deep in the lifestyles of the people it hosts. Within this hidden beauty, a hidden story lies. Stories of great yearning and need although in ignorance, a life lived without a hope of a tomorrow although a knowledge of its existence. A daily life with no electricity, no cars or motorbikes, no clean water, no system for waste and sewage (which crazily pollutes the water where their livelihood, the tilapia and the Nile perch, comes from), there is no trust in one another, no shoes, no lunches and no decent clothes for the kids, they wear some dirty and ready-to-retire uniforms that have been in circulation for longer than the wildly fluctuating Kenyan Shilling. Shacks are built of manure or corrugated iron sheets and randomly found-and-resurrected bits and bobs. There are about two bicycles (from a different century), dirt tracks that get flooded and impossible to go through after a big rain, there is HIV left and right, polygamy and widow-inheritance which, of course plays the biggest role in the spread of HIV, there are qualified but frustrated and unmotivated teachers who will wonder for the rest of their days why they spent so much money and time on college when they will never make it back unless they become headmasters and will be in the position to play with government and charity money.  (Imagine the impact of this on educating the kids). There are some wild ideas on life and existence, there are some very unusual beliefs, rituals, customs (some of which only contribute to the health issues), there is no motivation, there are no ideas or inspiration and if there is a spark of inspiration, there is no one to implement the ideas. Most people dream only about simple survival. Imagination is nearly dead. Everything stands still, frozen in time.
Each day passes and as time goes the exact definition of Majimbo´s contents of life rarely defines itself; for of reality, a harsher condition of life continues to dominate. On average seven out of ten students who enroll in the community primary school drop out before graduating, and out of those who graduate, very few of them join high schools due to poor performances and the incapacity to afford high school education... None of the girls in this community are educated. They either drop out of school as young as 15 to get married to fellow teens who are dropouts too or get pregnant somewhere on the way before reaching grade 8. Without education, a future is not created, a community is under extinction and this is what this community faces. Among these factors, comes HIV/AIDS which has impacted this community so negatively; ranging from reduced labor to loss of lives each time. Not ignoring the agony of this deadly disease, the people contribute to its spread although in ignorance but in the name of cultural practice and customs which illiteracy highly contributes to. Widow inheritance, polygamy and not observing AIDS prevention mechanisms especially with self-care in matrimonial lives.  The effects of these factors and the disease itself continue to live in this community and possibly forever if something is not done. I would take a moment to imagine 10 years from now and think about all the 10-15 year old children, if we do not take them to school, this is the lifestyle they will be living; all will be married with at least two children or two wives or would have married more than two wives of whom they will be living with none of them. This means that at least 60% of them to more than 70% of the youths in Majimbo today will have HIV/AIDS. They will also be working so hard fishing in the dangerous Lake Victoria to feed their families. If the reverse happens and all of them go to school, maybe only a few of them will be married, the probability that any of them will be HIV/AIDS positive will be highly reduced, none of them will be in the lake fishing but rather in school looking for opportunities and possibly just as I do, at least some of them will be out there in the world looking for opportunities for this community to make it better.
Out of Majimbo this year something unusual happened, it is surprising! Since when I got out of high school in 2011, only two have been admitted after me. All who have managed to graduate from high school after me did not join high school, either for financial or performance reasons. This year more than 20 students performed well and were admitted to high schools.

Already, even after only staying in school for two months, most of them have been forced to stay out of school because of the huge outstanding fee balances they already have yet their families cannot afford to pay. These students represent an array of diversity and varied conditions that although related are very different.

16-year-old Edward Mahala is the only child of a young couple who died just six years after the birth of their son. The couple who later died of HIV/AIDS after the young Edward was able to walk around the yard and enjoy the life of every toddler luckily did not infect their baby with the disease but the effect of their absence was felt just immediately after the father who died a year after the mother was just taken back to the soil. No one despite knowing the real need the young innocent Edward needed was ready to take him in to take care of him; the reason being the huge stigma this deadly disease held at that time. Indeed the grandmother with whom he lives today says that not even his uncles were ready to hear his story, they would literally evade it if they had to hear the name Edward. The poor little Edward was too innocent even to guess this. Two days later after all the people were to get back to their homes as the Luo culture demands after the burial of the dead, the grandmother took the little boy. She did not know how she was going to take care of him although she says she was in love with the angel after no one else was ready. She does not have a husband and two of her children are also suffering from this deadly disease. She did not have a job but largely depended on the help from the elder son who owns a boat at the lake. She was ready to share the little help she would always receive. Edward has since then grown into a boy ready to make her grandmother proud but still he cannot pay his school fees, neither can his grandmother.

Teaching a child to read using a finger to point out letters, phonics 
and words can be inaccurate and lead to confusion about what to read. ROOT
 solves this. ROOT is an innovative tool that helps anyone from moms and
 dads to teachers focus developing readers on all aspects of language; 
words, letters, phonics, sentences, and punctuation, using light to 
highlight it. ROOT will change the way learners absorb information. My 
name is Chad and I thank you for looking at ROOT, named because I 
personally watched it grow the “roots of reading competency.” I'm a 
married dad of two boys working hard to make this invention come true 
and hope you support this awesome idea.
Like myself many adults toil with teaching children to read but love the
 time spent with them and a great book. ROOT makes learning easier and 
turns reading into a fun and interactive activity for any young child. 
Say goodbye to distracting fingers crossing the page and accidentally 
covering parts of words. ROOT clearly highlights exactly what is to be 
read or understood including hard to learn consonant digraphs like the ch, sh and th sounds. It's a virtual highlighter you use in place of a pointer or fingertip.We live in a world where literacy can be the difference between success

Mllions of people are left with no food, drinking water and shelter.  Despite the funds, medical aid and support from all over the world, it is heartbreaking to see that many people in my hometown are still seeking help. A lot of people lost their houses leaving them homeless and with absolutely nothing to live on. People are living outside in the rain and sun with no shelter and no food. It is my appeal to please show support and donate so I can at least help these people get some shelter, drinking water, medicines, and food.  Any small help will make a huge difference in such a tragic time.Together , let's pray for Nepal and help to support Nepal and people during this catastrophe.This is my plan of action to target these areas.Around 5871 and counting more people in Bhaktapur area are homeless and living without shelter.

Summary
 
Women For Action, is a  501c3 organization which  champions women and  educate on the obstacles they face to bridge cultural differences. We interview women-firsts, award-winning subjects and other innovators, all who are making socially conscious contributions which aid in closing the gap between genders.
We are launching the first of its kind, the Women's Equality Exhibit to promote under recognized women change-makers from different cultural backgrounds. This national exhibit, is an expansion of our interview series and a proposed educational exposition on contemporary women who are  making historic achievements. Also, it is a collaborative initiative in honor of Women For Action’s  mission to petition leaders to elevate the national holiday, August 26th -  Women’s Equality Day to a federal holiday which has received signature support from women’s organizations across the country.

The exhibit's launch on August 26th, Women's Equality Day,  will feature 15 close to life-size (48 x 32) portraits of 21st-century women leaders, along with their bios and interviews. With a mission to promote diversity and inclusion, the project selects women who reflect today's American population, which is a representation of the entire world!

What We Need & What You Get
 Women For Action is looking to raise $20,000 to build this exhibit. This would enable us to launch the initial opening. Here is the breakdown:



55% towards the materials to build exhibit- This would include materials needed for 15 stations centered around each heroine, technical equipment and rental space for the facility holding the exhibit.


15% to operations cost,  

10% to promotions,

10% to transportation and storage,


5% to rewards and


4 to 5% to IndieGoGo- An approximate nonprofit rate based on if we will raise all or a portion of the funds.


Our unique perks include:  

A print copy of our painting exclusively for this campaign which is titled ""Windows of Opportunity"" and handpainted by Julene Allen, The Executive Director. The painting features six different women from different backgrounds. This artwork is a watercolor which includes gold leaf enamel that borders each woman's window.



Also, you can be the first to get tickets for this exhibit! Plus, they make great collectors items for this significant event. The location and city will be announced.

Be the first to get the copy of our limited edition magazine featuring watercolor drawings and a special message to girls from some of our heroines for this exhibit. It's such an exciting booklet for girls ages 5 to 17, or any young woman seeking inspiration.


 We chose flexible funding. Flexible funding takes a larger percentage from our fundraising total if I do not raise all the funds. However, this exhibit will need all its funds. So it's important that we meet our fundraising goal to build a quality exhibit for women heroines.      The Impact 
Too often, women's efforts go unnoticed. For those with a social disadvantage, the magnitude is even greater. The Women's Equality Exhibit would extend Women For Action's mission to do public good by aiding women and girls in three different ways:

It works against stereotypes and discrimination by promoting a diverse pool of women in leadership which could put women and girls at a social and political advantage. 
By increasing the numbers of our heroines and elevating their roles to emphasize the impact they are making, expands the pathways for women and girls.
Noting these women’s achievements sets the tone for prioritizing contributions made by women.



Our Featured Heroines

Bonnie-Jill Laflin, The First and Only Woman NBA Scout


Shuli Eshel, A Documentary filmmaker whose work has contributed to the women’s rights movement, politics and history in the United States and Israel


Audra Fordin, Founder of Women Auto Know©, an educational innovation for women car-owners


Zainab Khan, Global Women’s Rights Activist and Leading Artist whose work is being used for global nonprofits


Pam Erickson, Executive Director and Founder of Coastal Studies for Girls, a one of kind live- in leadership and marine science school in Maine  for girls 

Jen Gurecki, CEO of Coalition Snow, an innovative supplier of ski equipment for competitive women skiers. 
Edniesha Curry, Former WNBA and Europe basketball player and Founder of Coach Eddie Basketball



The objective is to spotlight women of significance who are a part of the American story- on our timeline, making history. We want to sound the bullhorn on new and amazing stories of women with  a conscious effort to promote diversity and inclusion. These trailblazers present new working models for 21st-century young women and girls especially as our society bolsters a future for equality!


Contributions made towards this exhibit builds a partnership between you and Women For Action to initiate a process which enables women’s voices to be heard, and society to be informed about more women who are reshaping our culture.Building Alliances with the CommunityLive solo performances from 
local women artists will be featured during key dates and times during

Other notesThis is Women For Action's first exhibit. However, we have sought out advice on how to build a quality educational exposition and have meticulously mapped out the materials needed for this project. Meeting our fundraising goal will enable us to incorporate an installation designer to aid us with our plans and other help needed.

   Risks & Challenges
Some of the challenges this project may face is finding the right location to launch the first exhibit. Space is everything and location is key. With such an important effort, we need the right space and ideally a central location within a major city to set the tone for others. So we are keeping this in mind as we submit inquiries to locations to host the exhibit.  
Update! The city of Chicago is top on the list. Right now, we submitted a proposal to a location within downtown Chicago. It is very likely the exhibit will be here. Being said, it's a central location, accessible and free to the public. The success of the Women's Equality Exhibit's first launch, catapults a mission to build others in different cities.

                                  Total ~$5,000
Rewards

All contributions are tax deductible
We will have a poster with the names of all contributors at the arena and the size of your name or logo will depend on size of donation.  Join in with friends to make a group donation! 

Backup Plan
If we are not able to reach our goal, we will run a much less extensive quad copter workshop and remaining funds will go to other camp labs in need of funding and towards scholarships for students.
Our impact
Experiencing our workshop will teach students about  these new emerging industries in STEM.  This is a rare hands-on opportunity to build and fly quad copters for young creative people, who would not be able to learn this on their own.  We hope to expand this beyond just being a hobby. They will learn great engineering skills that can help these students in future academic endeavors.                               
                   
Risks and Challenges
We might have trouble teaching students how to fly without crashing, which will result in damage to parts and repair costs. We are qualified to overcome this since we expect to be able to teach people who have never flown a quad copter  in approximately 30 minutes.                                                                                                      
  Difficulty in obtaining the funds we need might prevent us from offering this amazing opportunity to the budding scientists.

Why to build a center?
If you really want to know...
click here!
before you do that ""take a good sit""
find out for your self the raw reality of such a beautiful place.
...so why to build a center. Because we are a group of friends who see a way out! and because we can build a center, because we live foot prints behind us where ever we are, such foot prints will dictate the course of the future of our world and at last but not the least, because the Q`eqchi deserve options and the opportunity to read/write and their children deserve to play and they deserve a childhood with dignity, with access to pure water, food, education and fun.


                                


And if you wish to understand further, look at how your life could be if you where to live  with a budget as the people in Guatemala have... Hunger and Tortillas

Long term goal, To encourage self-reliance by creating sustainable economical revenues while acting as a pilot program which neighboring communities can replicate on their own.  

Risks and Challenges
Weather, the high rainfall can slow us or even stop us for weeks as heavy construction material have to travel long ways, through rain forest. 
We value your feedback and this community-base initiative requires collaboration on every level. Would you like to contribute your expertise in the field? We are very open to hearing your thoughts and would facilitate assistance on the ground if required.

What is the Community Center for?

         Providing remote and basic health care services
Acting as a model of sustainability      

     Protecting the rainforest of Izabal
Encouraging sound environmental practices        
 Facilitating greater community support

Creating a safe birthing center      

              Exposure to music & art seminars                    

Installing empowerment, inspiration, and sharing within the community  



                     



Ultimately

We would like to provide an economically and sustainable community-based model for the indigenous population of Guatemala to progress

We estimated last year the construction of the Community Center in Izabal, Guatemala (click here for location) to cost approximately $23,000 USD and we continue and look forward to achieve our goal. With your kind help in our last campaign 23 for 23,000 we raised US $ 6,682.00 minus 5% fee of Indiegogo, 3-5 % for Paypal transactions and on Credit cards 3% plus 30 cent per transaction.
This year we are aiming to collect what we need for construction materials,
US $ 17,927.00
Our work its carried out under volunteer basis and we 
have no administration cost.

Continuation of building of the Center has been scheduled for the third week of September 2015. We invite you to see this beautiful sanctuary for yourself and witness our dedicated work over the last 9 years to restore it’s fragile ecosystem. 
Your support is appreciated and every thought of care toward those less privileged is cherished dearly! And your volunteering engagement would show to others there's a way to prosperity and thoughtful environmental practices.
Thank you for helping us with this important project and allowing us
""to bring love, where love has never been”.
 

…for a brighter future and for a world filled with joy.
Viktor

any surplus of proceedings will be used for furniture, utilities and other items necessary for the center to get started.",19.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<i>Help us breed a new generation of UK based shoemakers!</i><p></p>
<p>Our aim is to teach and inspire enthusiastic individuals to design, hand make and sell footwear in an industrial, cost effective way within the UK.</p>
<p>Cos K London is a small handmade footwear company who's aim is to establish UK based manufacturing. Our applicants will have the opportunity to make a perfectly crafted pair of shoes, learn how to set up their own workshop, and hand make footwear in the most cost effective way possible. The intention is to show how hand made footwear can be a successful industry and not just a hobby or craft. We want to teach the future entrepreneurs of the UK to manufacture the perfect handmade shoe, and give these enthusiasts a real understanding of the construction and production techniques required to achieve the perfection that goes into each pair. </p>
<p>Cos K (our teacher) has 35 years of experience in making handmade, bespoke and production line footwear. He has been a major influence in the Fetish industry for over 3 decades and has worked closely with the couture fashion fratirnity.  He is the founder of several successful brands throughout these decades including Leatherworks, City Cobbler and now his most recent brand Fabulously Fetish.  He was also The Artist formerly known as Prince’s personal shoemaker for 9 years making his colourful fabric stiletto ankle boot.  His passion for breaking the boundaries in high heel making has truly influenced the modern world of shoes. Throughout the years, Cos K has found a way to balance the bespoke elements of shoemaking and factory based manufacturing process, and this is exactly what we will try to teach our students. With the gradual demise of the British shoe manufacturing over the last couple of generations, the shoemaking skills have been lost and the workforce is no longer available.  With your help we can change this. We believe that there are many young, talented, intelligent individuals who would very much like the opportunity to learn these skills and make successful careers for themselves in this wonderful industry. Lets make sure we give them the chance to do so and simultaneously re-build the much neglected industry that we love.</p>

<p>We will be separating the shoemaking course into five processes, so our students will learn easily how to compartmentalise their workload when working on a professional level.

<p>If we do not reach our target, the money we do raise will be spent on giving the students the most valuable experience possible, supplying them with the means to make their own shoes that they can take home with them and start to sell.  Also, it is most important to comply with health and safety acts and agreements.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions will help us breed a new generation of quality shoemakers, who will learn to appreciate the need for attention to the finer details and turning the crafting of a shoe into an art.  Our long term aim is to encourage London based designers to base their production in the UK, and to promote a more personalised business network within the fashion industry.</p>
<p>With the necessary funding, we will be able to educate a generation of young talent to understand the importance of quality and aesthetics without either factor being compromised.

Cuellaje is a remote parish in the Andes
Mountains of Ecuador.  The local school
is comprised of approximately 400 students and English courses are
mandatory.  Presently there are two
English teachers that provide daily instruction to students of all grade
levels.  There
is a computer lab, but it is in high demand and often not available.  In addition, motivation to learn English is
not very high.  This is partially due to
the fact that there are not many opportunities to speak English. </p>
<p>Most students plan to remain in the area and
work on the local farms and do not have plans to study in university.  Because of this, there is not a great need
for technical education and students can make a basic living without much
education.  However, there are a handful
of students who do have an interest in studying English and continuing their
education in university.  <b>Our goal</b> is to
provide the necessary resources and motivational strategies to encourage as
many students as possible to follow this dream.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441073461/dkjxfqleuuozsjvvwyop.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<h2>Goal: $7,000</h2>We need to raise <b>$7,000</b> to bring the English language into the classroom. Specifically, we are seeking: 
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>4 Projectors</strong> (presently the whole school shares one). - $2000.00
</li>
<li>
<strong>4 Chromebooks</strong> - $1500.00</li>
<li>
<strong>English Workbooks &amp; Interactive Video Lessons</strong> - $1200.00</li>
<li>
<strong>Visual English, Science &amp; Math Reference Posters</strong> - $300.00</li>
<li>
<strong>Perks </strong>- $1600.00 (Supports the local Kichwa community!)</li>
<li>
<strong>Indiegogo fees &amp; card processing fees</strong> - approx. $400.00</li>
</ul>
<div><h2>Stretch Goal: $10,000</h2></div>
<div>
<ul><li>
<strong>Scholarships</strong> (x2) + $1500.00 each</li></ul>
<div>If we meet our funding for the initial resources listed above, we hope to create a greater incentive for learning English by establishing a scholarship for students to travel to the United States and live with a voluntary host family for a month.  Each scholarship will include the cost of travel from Cuellaje to the Capitol of Quito, as well as round-trip airfare to their host family in the United States.  Students will be chosen by the staff of ""Unidad Educativa Cuellaje"" based on a combination of performance and merit.</div>

<p>Thanks to all of our volunteer models at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, New York!</p>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>While volunteering in the schools in Cuellaje over the past summer, I was often asked by the English teachers, ""What can I do to motivate my students?""  The truth is that there is not much reason for students to <i>buy into </i>their English language classes, or their education in general.  Very few English speakers visit Cuellaje and fewer locals move away.  Students in Cuellaje typically do not go on to university after grade school; generally they take up work on local farms and live very basically in or close to town.  </p>
<p>The objective behind this project is to provide the resources (projectors, computers, English workbooks and visual aides) and opportunities (English travel scholarships) that will motivate students to consider learning English, and external opportunities, such as university, to be a reality.  Your contributions will help us to achieve this and in return you will receive the highest quality hand-crafts the local indigenous Kichwa community have to offer.  <b>In addition to the impact that you will make in the lives of the students of Cuellaje, you will also be supporting the local indigenous community of Otavalo and the coffee growers of the Intag Valley.</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Being an international project, there are considerable challenges with regards to pulling this off successfully.  They are laid out below along with the steps that are being taken to be successful in spite of them.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><i><b>What happens if we don't reach our goal of $11,000?</b></i></p>

</div></div>","Background 
Cuellaje is a remote parish in the Andes
Mountains of Ecuador.  The local school
is comprised of approximately 400 students and English courses are
mandatory.  Presently there are two
English teachers that provide daily instruction to students of all grade
levels.  There
is a computer lab, but it is in high demand and often not available.  In addition, motivation to learn English is
not very high.  This is partially due to
the fact that there are not many opportunities to speak English. 
Most students plan to remain in the area and
work on the local farms and do not have plans to study in university.  Because of this, there is not a great need
for technical education and students can make a basic living without much
education.  However, there are a handful
of students who do have an interest in studying English and continuing their
education in university.  Our goal is to
provide the necessary resources and motivational strategies to encourage as
many students as possible to follow this dream.




Goal: $7,000We need to raise $7,000 to bring the English language into the classroom. Specifically, we are seeking: 



4 Projectors (presently the whole school shares one). - $2000.00


4 Chromebooks - $1500.00

English Workbooks & Interactive Video Lessons - $1200.00

Visual English, Science & Math Reference Posters - $300.00

Perks - $1600.00 (Supports the local Kichwa community!)

Indiegogo fees & card processing fees - approx. $400.00

Stretch Goal: $10,000


Scholarships (x2) + $1500.00 each
If we meet our funding for the initial resources listed above, we hope to create a greater incentive for learning English by establishing a scholarship for students to travel to the United States and live with a voluntary host family for a month.  Each scholarship will include the cost of travel from Cuellaje to the Capitol of Quito, as well as round-trip airfare to their host family in the United States.  Students will be chosen by the staff of ""Unidad Educativa Cuellaje"" based on a combination of performance and merit.



What You'll Get:





Hand-written Postcard - $2+
You'll receive a hand-written thank you postcard from our team!  Each postcard will feature images from Cuellaje and neighboring Otavalo.




Café Rio Intag - $12/$18
Beautifully aromatic shade-grown arabica coffee from the Intag Valley, in the Andes of Ecuador.  To top it all off, the local coffee industry is organized in a local association of growers, so farmers receive fair market value for their café.  Coffee is available in 1/2 lb. ($12) and 1 lb. ($18) packages.  Coffee is ground, roasted and ready for you to enjoy immediately!



Scarfs, Blankets, Ponchos, & Hammocks
The craftsmanship of the hand-made goods from the largely indigenous town of Otavalo, is well known throughout Ecuador.  You can choose between the beautiful scarfs, blankets, ponchos and hammocks purchased at market value, directly from the artisans who wove them.







Hand-loomed Scarf - $25Hand-loomed scarf or shawl, made by Antonio Lema and purchased at full market value from his family in Otavalo.  Please specify whether you would like a scarf or a shawl and choose from a base color (blue, red, green, purple, orange, pink, random).  Scarfs are sewn together in a large continuous fabric that can be looped twice around the neck (as shown above).  Shawls are open and can be draped or wrapped around the neck (as shown above).  Patterns will be similar to, but potentially vary from the images above.



Hand-Woven Children's Poncho - $40Hand-woven children's wool poncho, made by Zoila Teran and purchased at full market value from her family in Otavalo.  Choose from the earth tones pictured above (tan, brown, grey).  Ponchos will be similar to, but potentially vary slightly from the images above.

Hand-Woven Blankets - $50Hand-woven blankets, made by Matilde Lema and purchased at full market value from her family in Otavalo.  Choose a base color (blue, red, green, purple, orange, pink) and patterns will be similar to but possibly vary slightly from the images above.


Hand-Woven Wool Poncho - $60Hand-woven wool poncho, made by Zoila Teran and purchased at full market value from her family in Otavalo.  Ponchos will be similar to, but potentially vary slightly from the image above.

Hand-loomed Women's Poncho - $60
Hand-woven blankets, made by Veronica Muenala and purchased at full market value from her family in Otavalo.  Choose a color (red, white, blue, yellow) and patterns will be similar to but possibly vary slightly from the image above. 





Hand-loomed Hammock - $75

Hand-woven blankets, made by Veronica Muenala and purchased at full market value from her family in Otavalo.  Choose a color (red, white, blue, yellow) and patterns will be similar to but possibly vary slightly from the image above.


Donate by Nov, 8th and receive your perk(s) with plenty of time for the holiday season!

Thanks to all of our volunteer models at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, New York!

The Impact While volunteering in the schools in Cuellaje over the past summer, I was often asked by the English teachers, ""What can I do to motivate my students?""  The truth is that there is not much reason for students to buy into their English language classes, or their education in general.  Very few English speakers visit Cuellaje and fewer locals move away.  Students in Cuellaje typically do not go on to university after grade school; generally they take up work on local farms and live very basically in or close to town.  
The objective behind this project is to provide the resources (projectors, computers, English workbooks and visual aides) and opportunities (English travel scholarships) that will motivate students to consider learning English, and external opportunities, such as university, to be a reality.  Your contributions will help us to achieve this and in return you will receive the highest quality hand-crafts the local indigenous Kichwa community have to offer.  In addition to the impact that you will make in the lives of the students of Cuellaje, you will also be supporting the local indigenous community of Otavalo and the coffee growers of the Intag Valley.

    Risks & Challenges Being an international project, there are considerable challenges with regards to pulling this off successfully.  They are laid out below along with the steps that are being taken to be successful in spite of them.

What happens if we don't reach our goal of $11,000?
Good question.  If we don't reach our goal, then we will use the money we have raised (minus the cost of perks) to provide the resources we can afford.  Laptops and projectors will be first priority, followed by visual classroom resources and English workbooks.  Keep in mind that any money this project receives is working two-fold to benefit the local indigenous Kichwa community of Otavalo as well as Unidad Educativa Cuellaje.  
How will you ensure that the resources will be used as intended?
This project is built in direct partnership with the school system in Cuellaje.  The English department, the Inspector and the School Director (Principal, essentially) are all invested in the success of this project and there are check and balances in place to keep all parties accountable in the use of the resources which we will provide.  On top of direct school involvement in the project, the regional cooperative in charge of education, agricultural opportunities and economic development programs is involved and actively spreading the word.
How will you manage the fulfillment of all of the perks?
We have partnered directly with Kichwa families around Otavalo that are capable of providing consistently high quality products.  A different family is dedicated to the production of each of the different products that we are offering.  As the orders come in, Rosita Rojas (native to Otavalo) will be placing them with each of the designated families.  Once they are ready, she will ship the orders to the United States and we will distribute directly to you from New York City.  All orders should be ready by the holiday season and would make beautiful gifts!


Other Ways You Can Help! We understand that not everyone is in a position to help out with monetary contributions, but there are other ways that you can help.  Every person that shares this project online extends our reach to hundreds and potentially thousands of others; that's tremendous!  Please consider sharing our project with family and friends and imagine the opportunities that you can help create for the students of Cuellaje.",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

Welcome!

My name is Luis, and I thank you for taking the time to drop by our little school building campaign!

¿Whats going on here?I am raising money to finish building a Jr Primary School block for Standards 1 - 2 in the rural fishing community of Chigumukire, Senga Bay, Malawi.
¿Who am I?I am just one person who cares to make a small difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  I have spent the past 3 years working directly with community leaders and government educators to develop and successfully delivery ""Small Footprint, Large Impact"" educational projects in Malawi. 
All my projects have a sustainable end, which is to empower people to empower themselves, and I believe firmly that the best way to do this is at the educational level.
¿So what is the project goal?
Malawi is one of the poorest nations on earth, and education is substandard. The government sadly does not have the appropriate means to maintain nor further develop its educational infrastructural in order to meet  population needs. Our goal is enrich ""on-time"" education enrollment for learners in at risk rural communities such as Chigumukire whom don´t have access to a nearby school.  ¿What will happen when you finish the school?Once development is finished, our school block project will be handed over to the Community School Committee and the Malawi Board of Education/Salima TDC for administration in the governments public schools program as a sister school to Senga Bay Primary. Where are we now? 
As of October 10th 2014 we have finished about 85% of our first block


NOW WE NEED YOUR HELP
Funds raised will be used directly towards purchasing the following:(Stage 1) Materials for construction:


25x 50kg bags of Portland & 15x 50kg bags of Kumanga grade cement.

2x Hardwood door frames, 2x doors, 2x door knob lock sets, 2x deadbolts, 6 hardwood window frames, 1x roll of fine mesh screen, 4x Plywood boards, and 1ltr black paint in order to install two new blackboards in both classrooms.

12 6x2 Planks for creating sitting stools, classroom shelf's, and small table legs.

(Stage 2) Materials for classrooms:
Basic learning supplies such as chalk, pencils, schoolbooks and notebooks.
Some educational themed posters and learning based props to visually stimulate the children (i.e, Geographical Maps, ABCs & 123s Posters, Etc).All project labor is pooled through appointed local community volunteers,thus ensuring an elevated sense of community ownership. 

By supporting our project today you will not only empower us to finish building the first block of our jr primary school, but we´ll also be able to use the block as a community service area running awareness programs that aim to tackle such issues as HIV/AIDS and Malaria which are widespread in Malawi as a whole. 


 The community leaders and I thank you for taking the time to read through our campaign.

Muahahaha! )While in Romania, I plan to keep a journal and scrapbook, complete with an account of my daily adventures and thoughts, poetry, photos of the rich surrounding countryside, local recipes, legends, and lore, all of which I will publish upon my return. I think that this would be very educational for me, a great practice of discipline, cooperation, and social interaction, and a fabulous cultural experience. 

Those of you who help to fund my trip, depending on the level of your contribution, will receive either a postcard, a souvenier, a copy of my book, or a combination of all of the above. I have 28 days to pay the entry fee in full, otherwise permission for my participation will be withdrawn, so please donate and/or share!!! A portion of your donation also goes towards plane and train fare, as well as a small emergency fund. $7500 is the bare-bones minimum I need to make this trip a success!

If it so happens that I do not reach my goal, the funds that I do receive will be put into savings towards my winter missionary field-service in Madagascar with Mercyships. Either way, I can promise that your money is being put to good use. Thanks a bunch!! Muah!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3> </h3> <p> </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My name is Ken Clark. I can remember when I was 8 years old and being woken in the dead of night by the shrill whistle of a distant locomotive. I would stand on my bed and watch as a great light in the distance slowly grew ever larger. As the train passed from across the river and the whistle blew from behind that great white light, I'd wonder where that freight train was going, what it was hauling, and that one day, I'd be going to interesting places, too. Since then, I've done many things, travelled to many countries for a variety of reasons and experienced incredible highs and extremely deep lows by what confronted me in those countries and peoples I met. Very soon I'll be going to Maasai Land in Kenya and I'm asking you to join me in doing some very much needed, very good work.</p>
<p>I'm asking for your help in funding the EWASO MEDICAL CLINIC deep in the heart of Maasai Land in the Great Rift Valley of Kenya. A uniquely indigenous people, the nomadic pastoralist Maasai Tribe is impoverished, mostly from circumstances beyond their control, and as such suffer greatly from a whole host of ailments: from the common childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough to the more serious such as polio, meningitis, hepatitis A &amp; E and HIV/Aids. Among other more exotic ailments that run rampant within this group of gentle, kindly people are malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid, meningitis and polio. Even the common cold is a killer. Half of all children born to the Maasai die before the age of two. A child is not recognized as such until 3 moons have passed. This is because of the incredibly high mortality rate - a result due to the lack of medicine and accessibility to basic preventive medical care. Something we all take for granted, yet a miracle to others less fortunate. $5000 is the set goal to supply vaccines, medicines, preventive care, medical supplies and hope to the Maasai Tribe of Kenya. Will you help?</p>
<p>The EWASO MEDICAL CLINIC is located 75 kilometers (about 47 miles) west of Nairobi in the heart of Maasai Land. It has only one staff member, Doctor Merue, a former government senior medical officer who quit his job and returned to serve the needs of his community. The clinic serves over 50 patients a day. 5000 Maasai live in the area which is very hot and unfertile. Clean water is only a dream. People walk between 5 and 30 kilometers (3 to 18 miles) to the clinic every day to receive basic medical care and more.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to reach out and touch a culture, a tribe, another human being in desperate need in a substantial way and offer the hope and healing they deserve. Will you help? Any amount, no matter how small, goes a long way.</p>
<p>100% of your contributions go to supply the EWASO MEDICAL CLINIC with antibiotics, vaccines, cough medicines and suppressants, anti-diarrhea medication, bandages, gauze pads, surgical supplies - in essence, all that you would hope to find in an isolated rural medical clinic. This is practical,  hands-on, lifesaving contributing. You are guaranteed to help save lives.</p>
<p>For your donation, you in turn not only receive the satisfaction of having saved a life and help preserve a unique culture, but also, depending on the amount of your contribution, you can receive anywhere from a 'Shout Out' to 'Lots Of Cool Stuff' described in the contribution section. And if that isn't enough, if you have an even greater heart for the destitute among the Maasai, the perks mentioned herein could be 'hand-delivered' to your door by me, and possibly my lovely wife, along with dinner at a local eatery of your choosing.</p>
<p>So will you help contribute today? If you can't do so financially, can you help get the word out to your family, friends and co-workers? Remember, 100% of your donation goes to the EWASO MEDICAL CLINIC. Spread the word! Please use the INDIEGOGO 'share tools' on this site. No matter how much or little, every bit helps!</p>
<p>I thank you, Dr. Merue thanks you and the Maasai Tribal Peoples of Kenya thank you.</p>

<br/><h3>40 HOURS AND A BIKE</h3>
<h3>   YOUTH DEVELOPEMENT &amp; EARN A BICYCLE       PROGRAM</h3>
<div>
<p>              As a sophmore at Morehouse College I received a tool that would help me gauge the health and wellbeing of my life. This tool was a bicycle and I got it for only $25 from Sopo Bicycle Co-operative. I would ride this bicycle from East Atlanta to Morehouse College daily and I realized that riding a bicycle was a practical and engaging way to guide youth to become budding civil leaders, cyclist, and agriculturalist. All I had to do was get them on wheels. I started a bicycle shop out of my garage and kept it their for 2 years even through the birth of my first child Ezra Deangelo ""The Helping Angel"". In this garage we guided 75 youth through our pilot earn-a-bike program that helped rejuvenate the Ashview community garden and community association. </p>
<p>                40 Hours and a Bike is a youth development program that rewards participants with a bicycle, health, economic, agricultural, and cycling education in return for completing the community engaging course. It is a program catered to Wecycle Atlanta’s key promotional objectives: </p>
<p><b>Work Ethic</b></p>
<p><b>Health</b></p>
<p><b>Environment</b></p>
<p><b>Economics</b></p>
<p><b>Leadership</b></p>
<p><b>Sustainability</b></p>
<p>(Also known as the W.H.E.E.L.S. model)</p>
<p>Wecycle Atlanta makes these developmental objectives dually applicable through the cycling and agricultural components of the program. The outcome is a knowledgeable cyclist, budding agriculturalist, civically involved community member, and a youth educated on healthy and sustainable life practices. </p>
<p>The program is broken down into the following course:</p>
<p><b>10 hours: Agricultural Education and Cooperative Service</b></p>
<p><b>10 hours: Bicycle maintenance course</b></p>
<p><b>10 hours: Safe cycling course</b></p>
<p><b>10 hour:  Advocacy Project</b></p>
<p>Within all of our courses the participants will be engaged in the W.H.E.E.L.S model. The course spans two weeks in which the bicycles are presented to the youth in the beginning of the program so that students will get to enjoy ownership of their bicycle Participants will learn and work with their bicycle through the program. Upon the completion of the program the bicycle is rewarded to the 40 Hours and a Bicycle participant. </p>

<br/><p><b>Agricultural Education and Cooperative Service:</b></p>
<p>       To highlight the W.H.E.E.L.S. model, WeCycle Atlanta guides youth on bicycles rides to local farms and gardens that serve as agricultural educational sites that youth gain access while learning to grow food. The participants of the program aid the community by helping cultivate fresh produce often scarce within the greater Westside of Atlanta. Through their service work they will be helping sustain a regenerative community asset created directly to improve the health of local constituents. </p>
<p>While participating in the service, Wecycle </p>
<p>Atlanta’s trained agricultural staff will teach </p>
<p>participants:</p>
<p>- Lessons's on sowing seeds</p>
<p>- Use basic garden tools</p>
<p>- Plot options and growing techniques</p>
<p>- Basic growing conditions</p>
<p>- The economic and health benefits of locally grown food.</p>
<p>- The Farm to Table and Farm to Consumer Process</p>
