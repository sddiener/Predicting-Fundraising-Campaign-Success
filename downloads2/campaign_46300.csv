The tool is meant to create a score line on the bottle at the location you wish to cut the bottle. You simply need to align the cutter to place where you want to cut the bottle, tighten it to create a snug fit and slowly rotate the bottle, while you should make one full circle around the bottle with evenly distributed down force while rotating. You should hear the glass cutter scratching the glass surface. The score line should be slightly seen, but continuous all around the bottle.</p><p>2.<b>Separation:</b> There are many videos on the internet showing different methods to separate the two sections of the bottle, but after trying them all, the method that produces the most consistent results is simply to use the hot water (doing this over a kitchen sink is recommended). Boil some water and pour it evenly over the score line, not too much. After a few seconds, use a tap to pour cold water over the same score line. This cycle of hot and cold will cause the bottle to crack along the score line. The bottle should separate after one or 2 cycles of hot and cold, thicker glass may take additional cycles though.</p><p>3.<b>Sanding:</b> After splitting the bottle there is a sharp edge on both halves. Finish the sharp glass edge using the recommended sandpapers. There are three different grit size sandpapers included in the kit (60, 120, 180). You should start with 60 grit sandpaper, which will remove the sharp edge fast. For smoother result use 120 and 180 grit sandpaper accordingly. After using the 180 grit sandpaper the edge is perfectly smooth for simple use. If you still want it smoother, you can buy a higher grit sandpaper at your local construction depo.</p><h1>Green Mind-Set:</h1><p>With our product you would be recycling the same amount of the glass as before, but this time you would be giving the second life for the glass right away without any special treatment needed before. Thus, reducing the need of industrial recycling and giving the glass the second chance right away is a real resource saver.

Give the second life for used vine, beer, vodka and more glass bottles just by slicing them in half and more – the only limitation is your imagination. Promote green mind-set by recycling used glass bottles! About Us and Our Idea:Everything started with a bottle of beer in our hands while watching TV and few more bottles laying around in the kitchen next to the bin… No, we are not untidy guys, we just love beer.So who are we  - two old friends with a common vision for recycling used glass bottles and jars.

<p>Makeshift Apparel began in 2008 when I started selling my one of a kind,handmade clothes on Etsy. Ever since then, my passion for the brand has grown and grown until finally I decided to accomplish my dream of turning my little Etsy shop into a real business. </p>
<p>I've already done more work towards making my dream into a reality than I had ever imagined. I've obtained my business tax license, Fictitous Firm Name, and Seller's Permit. I did a ton of research and wrote an entire business plan including financial projections ( I can show it to you if you're interested in being a serious investor). I found a warehouse that I plan on turning into a work space with a sewing area, screen printing machine, photo studio, inventory storage,and an office. I bought a domain and had a website designed (<a href=""http://www.ilovemakeshift.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ilovemakeshift.com</a>).

Together we have co-invented the iPhone amplifier product we call Freq (sounds like ""freak""). Nicholas is an industrial designer with over 3 decades of experience developing products for the medical and consumer markets. Evan is a sophomore in high school with a keen sense of what the Gen Z crowd finds cool. Freq was the result of this father son collaboration combining marketing and tech skills that literally span generations. We have been working on this project for over a year, building multiple prototypes and experimenting with different shapes and horn flairs, working to optimize usability, sound quality, and appearance. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/354591/files/20140206211019-prototypes.png?1391749819"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Two-way Amplification</h3>The final geometry is a hyperbolic flair wrapped on a 90 degree curve. This ""patents pending"" design significantly amplifies your iPhone's speaker and it also concentrates sound waves directed at the phone's tiny mic, thus facilitating two-way, hands free calls or video chat.<br/><br/><h3>Better Design (the details)</h3>We know we are not the first but there are several qualities that separate this passive amplifier from other offerings you might find. 1. Superior ergonomic design - you can actually use and navigate your phone music or communication apps while docked firmly in Freq in both vertical or horizontal viewing mode <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/357496/files/20140208113503-horiz_mode.png?1391888103"" src="""" style=""""/></p>2. You can charge your phone while docked even if you have one of the old large 30 pin connectors (even the old deep one not shown in image)<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/357338/files/20140208100944-chargeing_in_dock.png?1391882984"" src="""" style=""""/>3. Great sound amplification - to a certain extent, the larger the horn 
the louder (and better) the sound you will produce. The Freq's horn 
volume is larger than most competitors. There were a couple we analyzed
 that were much larger but; A. we did not measure any significant 
improvements in db level B. you could not use the phone when in position and C. They were
 more costly $25 - $100. Based on our extensive research we know we have
 hit a sweet spot in terms of size and quality sound delivery which is 
why we have multiple patents pending on this design. Additionally Freq has a unique combination 
of ergonomic, aesthetic and charging features that further set it apart.<br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/357492/files/20140208112945-beauty_-_profile_scrubbed.png?1391887785"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h3>Where we are now:</h3>We have completed all the design refinements including how to accommodate all iPhone 4, 5 &amp; 5C devices and refinements that allow you to charge any of these phones while docked in Freq. More recently we have started collaborating with a high end injection mold company in New Jersey on the sophisticated tool design Freq will require. This is a great tool shop that Nicholas trusts and has worked with in the past.<br/><br/>In Summary we have completed the following:<br/>1. Multiple utility and design patents protecting Freq's unique geometry and appearance have been filed with the U.S. Patent Office.<br/>2. All trademarks have been applied for with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.<br/>3. Final CAD geometry is completed and files have been released for production.<br/>4. Final design has been rapid prototyped, tested and approved for production<br/>5. A $5000 down payment was made to NJ tool shop starting preliminary tool design<br/><br/><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need (the details)<br/>
</h3>We believe we will need $25,000 to complete the required tooling plus purchase the materials and packaging needed to fulfill our indegogo perk orders. Over 4/5ths of that total is just the tooling cost. This will be a complex (but really cool) injection mold tool capable of making over a million parts. It will consist of two halves of hardened steel and some proprietary movements to create the unique shape. Here is an image of a mold tool of similar size in case you have never seen one before.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/354610/files/20140206213327-Inj_mold_tool.jpg?1391751207"" src="""" style=""""/>They are even more impressive in action when they are mounted into a 300 ton press and parts are appearing every few seconds. We will keep all backers updated on the progress of the tool construction with images and perhaps video of key milestones.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Social &amp; Environmental Impact</h3><h4>Environmental:</h4>There are millions of battery powered phone speaker accessories currently flooding the market. All of these require charging or replaceable batteries and are helping to contribute to toxic landfills. This ""E-waste"" accounts for up to 70% of all toxic waste in landfills and it has become the fastest growing waste stream. Since Freq has no electronics it does not contribute to this problem. Many of the low cost passive amplifiers produced in Asia are made of Silicone which is costly to produce from an environmental standpoint. Our goal for Freq will be to include more earth friendly sustainable materials in it's construction. There are several just starting to emerge in industry. Here are a couple of cool new materials we are considering:<br/><a href=""http://www.weyerhaeuser.com/pdfs/businesses/cellulosefibers/THRIVE%20brochure.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.weyerhaeuser.com/pdfs/businesses/cellulosefibers/THRIVE%20brochure.pdf</a><br/><a href=""http://www.greendotpure.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.greendotpure.com/</a><br/><br/><h4>Social:</h4>Finally we are a team comprised mainly of high school or college kids which has been a huge win for the Freq team. They are affordable (crucial for a start-up) and represent our target market so we learn from them while they earn much needed burger, gas and clothing funds. With Freq and future planned projects we hope to encourage and mentor our young team members on their own sustainable entrepreneurial product development ventures.

At ASHLEY LIM, this has been our obsession since 2014.We believe in a women’s right to stylish shoes that make us feel powerful, confident and incredibly alive, yet so comfortable that they can actually support us throughout the day, rather than working against us. Understated Chic & All-Day ComfortOur shoes are designed with you at the forefront of our mind: we not only care about how our shoes look on you but how they fit and make you feel. By finely balancing comfort, style, with exceptional craftsmanship, we make shoes to fit your lifestyle, free from the pain and finally, seize the day.Check out our exclusive offer on the right hand side of your desktop screen. How to Order Your ASHLEY LIM ShoesTake up our exclusive offer of your made to measure (MTM) shoes today to experience the confidence, power and comfort that so many other women have found in ASHLEY LIM shoes.Three (3) simple steps:1.

  ""We can have it all - looking sexy whilst seizing the day​, everyday.""  Our Foot SpecialistFrom the very first collection, we have received the mentorship and advice from Australia’s most notable podiatrist, Dr. Kylie McCulloch, president of the state branch, Podiatry Association, Australia. Dr. McCullough is as passionate as we are about women’s rights to stylish shoes that are comfortable. “Finally, my patients can have fashionable shoes that can be made to measure with a split size option. This is my version of shoe heaven!” - Kylie McCulloch Handmade Just For YouA shoe size usually only refers to the length of a shoe, for most of the industry only provides one ‘standard’ width for each increment in length. Very few footwear brands also take variation in width and other important aspects of the foot into account, compromising comfort in order to save on cost. At ASHLEY LIM, we understand fitting is more complex than just an arbitrary length.Our TRU-FIT service guides you through how to accurately take your own measurements on our specially developed template and we also include a survey about what footwear you currently wear so we can ensure your new shoes from us fit perfectly, up to size EU 43.At the close of our Indiegogo campaign, we will email you our TRU-FIT template to print so you can measure and complete your order.Do you have any special needs or requirements?Thanks to our exclusive MTM service, we can also address any specific requirements you may need via our TRU-FIT service.Handmade to us means an obsessive attention to detail using techniques passed down over generations of shoemakers to make a product of unrivalled quality and comfort. Artisan shoemakers begin the process by selecting the right ‘last’ (the form used to make the shoe) which is then adjusted according to your TRU-FIT measurements.

<p><b>About this project:</b></p>
<p>Welcome! This is the official debut of Tech Meets Paper and we are excited to meet you. This is a Scotland born brand of functional and elegant notebooks and an innovative app.</p>
<p>We want to create beautiful products that inspire you to write or draw inspirational thoughts (or your shopping list!).  </p>
<p>We are lovers of technology and paper and this sparked our thinking to see what we could do to bring the analogue and digital together.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This application will enable you to download further digital stationery such as planners, audio tracks and quote cards. The big super duper thing that we are excited about is the Augmented Reality part of the app. As part of the notebooks we will provide images that can trigger off videos on your smartphone or tablet.</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Think of it like a ""life coach in your pocket.""</span><br/></p>
<p>This is the real differentiator of the brand and we would love to involve you in the making of it.</p>
<p><b>The products:</b></p>
<p>There is an initial capsule range of (paper) stationery and triangular writing sticks  (i.e pens &amp; pencils).<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> We want to provide a high quality product with a difference. We have been carefully poring over paper samples, scribbling on lined, blank, and triangle printed paper and researching with focus groups, designers, printers and stationery aficionados to bring you the best quality notebooks.</span></p>
<p><b>Our notebooks.</b> Both notebooks are made from the finest of paper, the covers are in deep claret (GF Smith colour plan Claret plain finish 350gsm) and all logos embossed with delightful copper foil. The inside pages are Olin smooth cream <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">(</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">made with 100% elemental chlorine free pulps for natural colours), </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">120gsm and are a combination of blank pages and faint triangular patterns.

</p><p><b>The app:</b></p>
<p>This is the difference that makes the difference. Our love of technology inspired us to create an integrated application. </p>
<p>This app (works on both Android &amp; iOS platforms) will provide you with a further dimension of stationery and unlock access to creative inspirational resources. Your app gives you:</p>
<ul>
<li>downloadable, digital stationery - this will consist of scribble sheets, daily/weekly/goal planners, digital backgrounds</li>
<li>quotes and top tips - we all love a motivational pick me up so we will provide you with your favourite quotes all in one app</li>
<li>audio tracks - think of this like a mini life coach in your pocket (or your phone) that will give you meditation tracks, kick-ass motivation and insights into the workings of your brain (yikes)</li>
<li>and Augmented Reality - Augmented Reality allows you to access secret trigger videos that will pop up on your phone or tablet. There will be 6 changeable videos overlaid within the notebooks.</li>

About this project:
Welcome! This is the official debut of Tech Meets Paper and we are excited to meet you. This is a Scotland born brand of functional and elegant notebooks and an innovative app.
We want to create beautiful products that inspire you to write or draw inspirational thoughts (or your shopping list!).  
We are lovers of technology and paper and this sparked our thinking to see what we could do to bring the analogue and digital together.
This application will enable you to download further digital stationery such as planners, audio tracks and quote cards. The big super duper thing that we are excited about is the Augmented Reality part of the app. As part of the notebooks we will provide images that can trigger off videos on your smartphone or tablet.Think of it like a ""life coach in your pocket.""
This is the real differentiator of the brand and we would love to involve you in the making of it.
The products:
There is an initial capsule range of (paper) stationery and triangular writing sticks  (i.e pens & pencils). We want to provide a high quality product with a difference. We have been carefully poring over paper samples, scribbling on lined, blank, and triangle printed paper and researching with focus groups, designers, printers and stationery aficionados to bring you the best quality notebooks.
Our notebooks. Both notebooks are made from the finest of paper, the covers are in deep claret (GF Smith colour plan Claret plain finish 350gsm) and all logos embossed with delightful copper foil. The inside pages are Olin smooth cream (made with 100% elemental chlorine free pulps for natural colours), 120gsm and are a combination of blank pages and faint triangular patterns. All are printed locally in Scotland by a passionate, creative, family-run business.
Signature notebook (our favourite) - this is a trifold notebook ( 210x120mm) - think of it like a corcertina. Effectively what this means is - you have three notebooks in one! Perfect for those multitaskers or those of us who like to have separate sections for the different parts of our lives. 
Executive notebook - is larger in size (180 x 255 mm) with blank pages waiting to be filled with inspirations, meetings notes or your latest heady dream. 

Triangular pens - sustainable Swiss made, black-ink, ballpoint pens. This classic triangular pen is an ergonomic dream. Oh and did we mention they are copper...to match your copper foiled notebook.

Triangular pencils - also copper in colour and are made by a family-run, UK based business that have been making pencils in all shapes and sizes for over 100 years.

The app:
This is the difference that makes the difference. Our love of technology inspired us to create an integrated application. 
This app (works on both Android & iOS platforms) will provide you with a further dimension of stationery and unlock access to creative inspirational resources. Your app gives you:

downloadable, digital stationery - this will consist of scribble sheets, daily/weekly/goal planners, digital backgrounds
quotes and top tips - we all love a motivational pick me up so we will provide you with your favourite quotes all in one app
audio tracks - think of this like a mini life coach in your pocket (or your phone) that will give you meditation tracks, kick-ass motivation and insights into the workings of your brain (yikes)
and Augmented Reality - Augmented Reality allows you to access secret trigger videos that will pop up on your phone or tablet. There will be 6 changeable videos overlaid within the notebooks.

     




  

Prints:
Our bespoke prints come in either copper foil, rose-gold or leopard print foil. With both landscape and portrait, these handmade products make the perfect gift for ridiculously cool people.








 Perks table:
These are the perks we have on offer but look at the right hand side for the fine details:


This campaign will support the building of the brand and put our signature product into production.
With your support we will begin production of the product and get the really clever technical people building the app.
Your contribution will allow us to develop the augmented reality and trigger videos for the notebooks. The augmented reality requires images to set off specific trigger videos and we want to ensure these videos are right for our community (you!) and so we shall send  a questionnaire to our contributors to poll information on what the best trigger videos will be. This connection with our community is really important and will continue in the lifecycle of your product.
Tech Meets Paper is more than something to write on or write with…it is an inspirational brand that we hope will motivate, encourage and inspire you to create brilliance.
Update: Following the close of this campaign on October 21st we shall send an update to all our contributors on delivery schedules and get your parcels on their way to you.
As soon as the app is ready we shall send to all who have contributed.

</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>Robertson returns annually to Nedjo for general maintenance and filter replacements. In 2016 we will provide him a complete off grid power station that he can similarly carry in a few suitcases by commercial air. <b>Battery and Solar technology LEAPS since the '70's make this possible.

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>5% of all funds raised above our $20,000 minimum funding goal will go towards these goals.  We are not a charity and do not seek a donation nor can we provide a tax receipt at this stage of our development.  But we will be transparent and post on our website and social media pages exactly how that 5% is utilized should we be fortunate enough to hit at least our minimum goal.</b></p>

<p><b>From an environmental standpoint 1 JUICE battery can keep up to 1,000 disposables out of landfills.  1 LEAP filter can similarly replace up to 2,000 bottles of water. We are working right now on a filtered water bottle as well. To succeed the burden is on us to create products you love to use. If we can do this then we empower you to make better Eco choices without compromising your product performance needs. For example we believe JUICE does just that:</b></p> <ul> <li><b>Reduce battery replacement costs and disposals up to 1,000 x's.</b></li>
<li><b>No performance compromise: can even power High Drain devices longer. </b></li>
<li><b>No convenience sacrifice: ready to use right out of the pack.</b></li>
<li><b>No mobility compromise: Recharge in 40 minutes from home, car or solar.</b></li>
<li><b>No learning curve: Auto Smart Charger: Pop batteries in &amp; walk away.</b></li>

<div><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We have done all we can to minimize the risks by completing all but the final step in production before coming to you today.  However 30-years of Product Development teaches you ""never say never"".  Anything can happen to derail a project that can be out of your control such as an unexpected flood at your factory or a labor strike.  No project, company or person is adverse to risks.</b></div>
<div><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></b></div>
<div><b style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">However the key to success is the ability to communicate and persevere through a risk or a challenge.  Labor strikes eventually end, flooded factories get cleaned up and in almost all cases a project can be put back on the rails and successfully completed through communication and </span>perseverance<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.  While we can't promise you there will be no risks or challenges we can assure you that we will use our best efforts to communicate any potential delays to you.</span></b></div>

    The Impact Our vision is to use the ""Ben & Jerry's"" original corporate model to allow a percentage of revenues generated through consumer sales of LEAP OFF GRID GEAR to help fund a great deal more projects like Nedjo. We envision LEAP OFF GRID Water & Power utilities all over the globe.  We want to build them at affordable costs for those with a passion to help deliver and maintain them.

5% of all funds raised above our $20,000 minimum funding goal will go towards these goals.  We are not a charity and do not seek a donation nor can we provide a tax receipt at this stage of our development.  But we will be transparent and post on our website and social media pages exactly how that 5% is utilized should we be fortunate enough to hit at least our minimum goal.

From an environmental standpoint 1 JUICE battery can keep up to 1,000 disposables out of landfills.  1 LEAP filter can similarly replace up to 2,000 bottles of water. We are working right now on a filtered water bottle as well. To succeed the burden is on us to create products you love to use. If we can do this then we empower you to make better Eco choices without compromising your product performance needs. For example we believe JUICE does just that:  Reduce battery replacement costs and disposals up to 1,000 x's.
No performance compromise: can even power High Drain devices longer. 
No convenience sacrifice: ready to use right out of the pack.
No mobility compromise: Recharge in 40 minutes from home, car or solar.
No learning curve: Auto Smart Charger: Pop batteries in & walk away.


If you share our product or corporate vision then please show your support through choosing a Product Perk.  You can get 3 complete sets of JUICE Replay Batteries and Chargers for $25 in our Reward Perks.  If you share our vision but are not ready or able to make a product choice today but want to help us meet our goals then please share our campaign on your networks!
   Risks & Challenges
We have done all we can to minimize the risks by completing all but the final step in production before coming to you today.  However 30-years of Product Development teaches you ""never say never"".  Anything can happen to derail a project that can be out of your control such as an unexpected flood at your factory or a labor strike.  No project, company or person is adverse to risks.

However the key to success is the ability to communicate and persevere through a risk or a challenge.  Labor strikes eventually end, flooded factories get cleaned up and in almost all cases a project can be put back on the rails and successfully completed through communication and perseverance.  While we can't promise you there will be no risks or challenges we can assure you that we will use our best efforts to communicate any potential delays to you.

But most important we commit our best efforts to persevere until we succeed should we encounter any challenges.  We believe we have a team that is more experienced than most at taking things from a concept to a finished product. We have battled just to get to this stage.  LEAP is more than just an idea to us. It is the Company we want to spend the remainder of our business careers building.  It is the one all previous experiences have led to.  We will not quit.

<p>The Racerback Sports Cami and Extended Sizes for The Racer Seamless Sports Bra grew from my dream to provide girls with outstanding base-layer for sports and school. When my daughter was a pre-teen, she was a serious athlete in need of performance wear. We were forced to shop in the boys’ department sending the subliminal message that athletic girls were less than feminine. Clothes in the girls’ departments were all “fashion” and made of lower quality fabrics, not meant for seriously active girls. Women’s athletic wear didn’t fit correctly or worse –it wasn’t age-appropriate. Shopping trips were awkward especially for bras and support tops – and I didn’t want this to be a barrier to sports. When other mothers shared similar frustrations, I knew I had to do something to make a difference.</p>
<p>The solution was Dragonwing girlgear, a line of sports tops, bras and other essential every day underwear that can be worn under a sports uniform or day clothes. As our business grew, customers told us they wanted a sports cami with our beautifuI high performance fabric but with more mesh for coolness and breath-ability, more support and thin pads to hide anything embarrassing. At the same time, we saw a growing number of studies documenting that breast development was becoming a barrier to sports for adolescent girls.  So we started developing two new products to solve these problems.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482363402/k7m1pun0l3vbiifenkl3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Racerback Sports Cami uses beautiful, anti-microbial, wicking, UV50 Italian fabric with a large silver infused mesh panel in the back -- so it is breathable and cool, even on the hottest day. We use Italian fabric because it will perform to the high standard our girls play and is used for many elite sports, including cycling triathlon and running.  The quality and hand feel is amazing.  </p>
<p>We made adjustable straps --and a modified racer style for extra support. There are thin removable pads so you have the choice to use/not use them and the ability to remove the pads to wash them separately. The cami’s built-in silver infused mesh shelf bra provides coverage where developing figures need it most. No slipping straps. A fit that’s snug. But not tight.  The perfect athletic cami for sports and school.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482363430/b2rqpqjegskm2mwe4fkt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Racer Seamless Sports Bra is our number one selling product. We are seeing and hearing from our customers that we need more sizes to accommodate more girl shapes from AA to DD and more. So we've interviewed girls and moms, measured and tested different variations to expand our size range - and we think we have the perfect fit. The Racer Seamless Sports Bra is double layered to prevent chafing, longer so you won't feel exposed, wicking, antimicrobial and super soft because of the fine high quality yarns we are using. The Racer Seamless Sports Bra will meet the needs of many active girls who want a high performance bra that is made for their figure. </p>

<p>Rose -- ""PERFECT GIRLS BRA ""My husband purchased the racer back sports bra as a gift for our daughter who is very athletic.

I am ordering more in different styles and colors. Thank you!  </p>
<p>LucyC -- ""EXCELLENT AND WELL WORTH THE COST FOR A GOOD QUALITY SPORTS BRA . I am 17, about 103 pounds and I got the medium sports bra and it feels great. It provides a lot of support along with excellent comfort and a very soft and breathable material. 10/10.   I would get another one! ""</p>

<p>Cy Collection was born out of our frustration at our inability to find high-quality jewelry for an accessible price.   We thought that there had to be a better option - that we shouldn't have to to choose between quality and accessibility. </p>
<p>We talked directly to manufacturers and discovered that retail brands mark up their jewelry 10-20 times. This is to cover an expensive distribution model, pricy retail store overhead, high marketing costs and bloated brand inflation. So, the price we pay as consumers is mostly to cover expensive overhead and mark-up instead of paying for a quality product.  </p>
<p>We decided that this way of doing business is out of style. So, we cut out the middleman, slashed our internal costs, and sell directly to you without the insane mark-ups. Because of our low overhead, we can afford to make a higher quality of jewelry than most retail stores offer, and still sell it for a fraction of the price. This is our vision. Our passion. Our mission. This is Cy Collection.  </p>

<p>Have you ever bought an expensive piece of gold-plated jewelry, only to have it discolor or chip within a few months, or even a few weeks? This is because most jewelry companies use a process called flash electroplating, where a microscopic layer of gold is chemically plated on top of another metal. The gold is so thin, that it's really no surprise that most plated jewelry doesn't last. </p>
<p>Cy Collection jewelry is plated with two layers of gold, using advanced techniques that can last up to eight times longer than flash-electroplating. This double-plating technique is used by the most expensive jewelry brands, whose jewelry typically costs a few hundred to upwards of a thousand dollars. We work directly with the same manufacturers and materials as these brands, to bring you the same quality of jewelry for an affordable price.</p>

<p>We don't want to brag, but we think it looks pretty darn good! We will let you be the judge of that. However, we do want to point out a couple of key things:</p>
<p>+  All of our jewelry is made from the highest quality materials, like 14K gold over brass.</p>
<p>+  Our jewelry is double plated with multiple plating techniques to last longer than traditionally plated jewelry.</p>
<p>**To make all gold-plated jewelry last longer, please follow the care instructions we will send with your jewelry.</p>

Cy Collection was born out of our frustration at our inability to find high-quality jewelry for an accessible price.   We thought that there had to be a better option - that we shouldn't have to to choose between quality and accessibility. 
We talked directly to manufacturers and discovered that retail brands mark up their jewelry 10-20 times. This is to cover an expensive distribution model, pricy retail store overhead, high marketing costs and bloated brand inflation. So, the price we pay as consumers is mostly to cover expensive overhead and mark-up instead of paying for a quality product.  
We decided that this way of doing business is out of style. So, we cut out the middleman, slashed our internal costs, and sell directly to you without the insane mark-ups. Because of our low overhead, we can afford to make a higher quality of jewelry than most retail stores offer, and still sell it for a fraction of the price. This is our vision. Our passion. Our mission. This is Cy Collection.

Have you ever bought an expensive piece of gold-plated jewelry, only to have it discolor or chip within a few months, or even a few weeks? This is because most jewelry companies use a process called flash electroplating, where a microscopic layer of gold is chemically plated on top of another metal. The gold is so thin, that it's really no surprise that most plated jewelry doesn't last. 
Cy Collection jewelry is plated with two layers of gold, using advanced techniques that can last up to eight times longer than flash-electroplating. This double-plating technique is used by the most expensive jewelry brands, whose jewelry typically costs a few hundred to upwards of a thousand dollars. We work directly with the same manufacturers and materials as these brands, to bring you the same quality of jewelry for an affordable price.


We don't want to brag, but we think it looks pretty darn good! We will let you be the judge of that. However, we do want to point out a couple of key things:
+  All of our jewelry is made from the highest quality materials, like 14K gold over brass.
+  Our jewelry is double plated with multiple plating techniques to last longer than traditionally plated jewelry.
**To make all gold-plated jewelry last longer, please follow the care instructions we will send with your jewelry.
+  Our jewelry is certified nickel-free. 
+  Our jewelry is designed with an elegant, timeless aesthetic that will fit with any look, and will never go out of style. 
+  Our jewelry is made to enhance -not dictate- your style. Each piece can be worn in a multitude of ways...so mix, match and stack it up however you like. 
+  Our jewelry is designed to fit a variety of sizes with adjustable chains and flexible materials that can be bent gently for a customized fit. 
+  Our polished pieces can be dressed up or down, so they can go from work to play, and day to night.
+  All of our jewelry comes in our luxury Cy Collection boxes - perfect for a beautiful gift, or to display on your dresser.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>In order to ensure the campaign is a good representation of the wallet you receive, the one you see on the campaign is made in the same way yours will be. We’ve put over a year of prototyping into our wallet, pouring time into finding the best leather as well as materials to make sure you get the finest and most affordable wallet around. Sometimes crowdfunding can bring up unexpected hiccups, but we’re prepared for every eventuality. We put together many backups for every step of the process, from manufacturing to mailing, so we'll definitely deliver on time. We plan to keep an open channel with you through Indiegogo updates to ensure you always know what’s going on with your pledge.</p>

protection groups out there but it’s hard to get the word out.  That’s why we want to combine our passion for
saving the wildlife with a hip brand.</p>

<p>We would like to reach two goals by doing this. First we want to put
more eyes on the poaching of rhinos. Second we want to specially support
someone, we think who is doing a great job for helping and supporting those
animals.</p>
<p>Our job will be to make this project big, and to support more people
like Louise.</p>
<p>Furthermore we will try to combine an exciting fashion brand with the

with our/your help, on our coming up channels, as far as you are interested in
it.</p>
<p>The support from people like you means the ability for us to create more
Subprojects (and of course more cool items).</p>

possibility to wear more than just a nice shirt. If you are not interested but
you love our shirt anyway of course you’re still

<p>
</p>
<p>My name is Deadcell84. I’m a dedicated artist and
illustrator who has decided to use fashion as a medium for my art. Over the
years, I have developed a story using illustrations about a fictional corporation called Deadcell Laboratories. The story is being told with art and every new series continues the plot and leaves you wanting more. Throughout this time, I experimented in
clothing design and received a lot of positive feedback from my audience in the
form of sales. I have been able to work different jobs and sell enough
merchandise to fund bigger projects every time. Now I am at the point where my
next project is too big for me to fund on my own. Therefore, I’m asking
friends, family, fans, and anyone else who stumbles upon this page and happens
to dig my art—or simply wants to help a dedicated artist take his work to the
next level—to help me make Dead Clothing a reality. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In total, I need $20,000 to get Dead Clothing off the ground.
One of the things your money will go towards is renting a small studio space.
This will allow us to have a central meeting place we can work from, store
clothes in, and conduct meetings with partners and associates. Another part of
the money will go towards purchasing organic American Apparel t-shirts in bulk.
I’ve deemed American Apparel not only as a company that produces high-quality
products, but also abides by strong ethical codes of production. The remainder
of the money will go towards manufacturing/packaging merchandise, shipping,
trade show booths, and video/photo shoots. </p>
<p>In return for your generous donations I
have some very unique and limited art prints to give out, as well as runs of my
t-shirt prints, and stickers. Our
goal is $20,000, but whether we get $5000 or $25,000, Dead Clothing will be a success;
it’s just a matter of time. Dead Clothing will be a reality no
matter how hard we have to work.</p>

<br/><h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Art is usually an expression of the artist. When people buy art

expression of the artist becomes the expression of the owner. </p>
<p>As I noted above, I’ve had great feedback via good sales of what
I have produced, such as tee shirts and hats. Just recently I posted hats for sell
with my trademarked battery logo, and within 20 minutes they were sold. I
believe that kind of response indicates that people are very interested and
inspired by the quality of the product and the expression of the product.</p>
<p>As a young artist that is inspiring to me. I have a vision, I
create it, and people respond to it. That is the most amazing feeling to have –
people that I don’t know responding to my creative thoughts, creating a bond
with them even though we’ve never met.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>This

encounter many hurdles along the way. However, I have never been more serious
or determined about anything else in my life. I have learned many lessons, gained
priceless knowledge, and made several important contacts that I did not have
before. I WILL overcome any and all obstacles that present themselves in establishing
Dead Clothing, because to me the risk of not doing it is far greater then
failing.  </p>

 CIGA Design J Series is
Exclusively designed to enhance the experience of flowing time, meditation, and Zen.
Inspired by Karesansui gardens and forged from meticulous Japanese mechanics and innovative design philosophy.
Imbued with distinctive consideration for the beauty found in symmetry, purity, and mechanical refinement. 
    
 CIGA J Series consists of three layers which can be interpreted in many ways, each one making us feel at peace and with greater purpose through the course of time.One possible interpretation parallels the layers with levels of consciousness. The solid outer layer represents all that is present in our physical reality. The semi-transparent middle layer represents the inner world of the mind and subconscious – where our thoughts, feelings, and identity exist. The fully transparent center layer represents the essential core of existence - all that we are and our ever-present connection to the universe.The hollow inner layer bears witness to the incredible mechanisms within the timepiece, further guiding us to embrace and feel at one with the passage of time.  

  CIGA Design J Series is a Chinese-Japanese co-creation – its design is inspired by shared traditional Karesansui and Zen aesthetics. From our passion for seeking tranquility and Zen, we have continually researched and iterated upon our J Series timepiece to carry the aura and presentation of a Karesansui garden. The term Karesansui means ‘Dry Landscape’ or ‘Dry Mountains and Water.’ In a Zen garden, Water is represented by sand, and Mountains are represented by stone. Karesansui is often used by Japanese monks to aid in meditation, as these still elements are believed to have a calming effect which allows for separation from distractions in order to focus one’s energy.    The lines in the sand of a Karesansui inspired the design of the J Series strap. It subtly expresses the modesty, yet ethereality of Zen. Fashioned from FDA-approved elastic material – the Karesansui strap is sweatproof and kind to the skin. What's more, it has a quick-change function, easy to change to your other straps. 
 
 CIGA Design J Series features original, cutting-edge mechanics and visual presentation that brings wonder and enchantment to time-telling. The three clock hands cross in a countless number of permutations to form various captivating visual effects.  The long minute and second hands are equal in length and span across the entire dial. Together, they cross at varying times to form different visual patterns and symmetrical X-shapes that are a joy to behold and are highly recognizable at a glance. The red hour hand is a representation of ‘I’ – it is symbolic of the individual’s presence in the external world, while simultaneously pursuing deeper internal meaning. The ‘I’ hand floats gracefully above the core layer of CIGA Design J Series, completely in tune with its essential self.   

 
 
Our J Series timepiece features an original dial design that includes 120 fine lines, with an angle width of just 0.3mm.
 It defies the conventional look with an intricate, yet simple visage. Its time-telling mechanics are meticulously precise, and yet feel in harmony with the flow of time and nature. 
  CIGA Design J Series is equipped with a custom Japanese CITIZEN MIYOTA Movement. Never stopping, never dull — it moves at a frequency of 21,600 times/hour. 21 jewels  improve energy storage to 42 hours. 
 
 
   
 The packaging for The CIGA Design J Series Mechanical Watch has been awarded in the Red Dot Award. The packing is a miniature of the Zen culture, unique design, and the amalgamation of culture. It has the same design philosophy as the product it contains which represents three levels of Zen awareness.

The Ziggy is a laced boot with side zipper to make them easy to slip on and off. We construct them with waxed calf suede leather and a raw stacked leather outsole for improved flexibility and durability.    Become a backer of this project and pick a reward. You will essentially be pre-ordering a pair of The Ziggy Boots. You'll get a special backer discount, and you'll receive your stuff before it is available in stores.      The beauty of a leather shoe is the weathered look that comes with regular use and age; imparting character and personality to the shoe. It’s a lasting stamp of ownership that is unique to every pair. The wrinkles in the face of a seasoned explorer tell a thousand tales, the weathering of leather tells a distinct story – of adventures undertaken, mysteries unraveled, and experiences gained!Like all good things, developing that aged look takes time. These are boots that grow along with you. You might get lost here and there, get some scratches and scuffs, but at the end of the day you’ll still keep walking forward. As you develop into your best self, so does your shoes.Your Ziggy’s will become a reflection of your adventures and look even better as you break them in. The unique patina finishes reverberate the ethos of the brand, imperfectly perfect, just like nature and life. You don’t need to have everything figured out or know exactly where you’re going, just keep walking and you’ll find your way. Choose Between Two Out-soles:Lugg Outsole or Leather Outsole  We craft the Ziggy with a true goodyear welt, the best method of shoe construction used in only the top 1% of men’s shoes. This makes our boots more flexible, comfortable, durable, and breathable than the average shoe. Goodyear welt construction prevents water from getting into the insole making the shoe water resistant, allows for easy sole placement, and makes the shoes last much longer if properly cared for. The shoe is made using waxed calf suede, the leather is tanned by a special process that retains natural oils and waxes. It has the advantage of being moisture resistant, and does well in poor weather without the leather becoming water saturated and having to dry out as normal leather does.   Perfect for Job Interviews, Family Functions, Dinner Parties, Motorcycle Rides, Date Nights, Bar Hopping, Road Trips, and everything in between. Versatility is key for us, we need a pair of boots that we can wear everyday of the week. These shoes are there for when you need to dress up and dress down. It’s the right shoe when you need it.    Growing up in Southern California surfing and traveling throughout Mexico, ZZYXX Road was the intersection of two great cultures and lifestyles. Every time I passed that sign I knew I was about to start a new life experience. It literally became a pass through; both a mission and a mystery.These shoes are the for all the guys who are growing up, trying something new, and taking their life in a whole new direction. When your tastes and life changes, so should your shoes.How many times have you passed the same street and never taken a detour? ZZYXX is about the journey not the destination, it’s about the road less traveled. Go against the grain, rules are made to be broken. Be bold and live your life on your own terms.

<h3>PRIMUS - Welt der Primzahl</h3>
<p>Ich möchte Menschen, die sich für Mathematik, für Zahlen und speziell für Primzahlen interessieren, den Zugang zu einer Technologie ermöglichen, die ich in den letzten Jahren hobbymäßig entwickelt habe.</p>
<p>Bei allen, die Mathematik nicht als Lieblingsfach in der Schule haben oder hatten, möchte ich das Interesse an Mathematik, Zahlen und speziell Primzahlen und nicht zuletzt, an der von mir entwickelten Technologie, wecken.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Warum Primzahlen?</h3>
<p>Primzahlen sind geheimnisvoll, magisch und ... unhandlich, wenn es in die höheren Größenordnungen und in die großen Mengen geht, selbst wenn man mit einem Computer arbeitet.</p>
<p>Die Jagd auf die größte bekannte Primzahl  überlasse ich anderen - das Thema ist gut besetzt.</p>
<p>In meinem Projekt geht es um die große Menge von Primzahlen und um den beliebigen und schnellst möglichen Zugriff darauf - meine <strong>PRIMUS-Datenbank</strong> macht solches möglich.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Die Technologie</h3>
<p>Der <strong>PRIMUS-Server</strong> bietet völlig neue informations-technische Sichtweisen auf Primzahlen:</p>
<ul>
<li>als Primzahlen-Strom, den man sich von einem beliebigen Startpunkt aus <br/>auf- oder absteigend liefern lassen kann z.B.: <br/>2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 ... <br/>... 37, 31, 29, 23, 19, 17...</li>
<li>als abzählbare Menge, auf die indiziert zugegriffen werden kann z.B.: <br/>Welche ist die 10 Milliardste Primzahl? <br/>Antwort: Es ist die Primzahl  252.097.800.623</li>
<li>als Umkehrung der vorherigen Funktion z.B.: <br/>Die wievielte Primzahl ist z.B. die Primzahl 123.456.789.012.301? <br/>Antwort: Nr. 3.930.144.562.801 (3 Billionen 930 Milliarden 144 Millionen ...)</li>
<li>als Funktion ""Primzahl in der Nähe einer beliebigen Zahl"" z.B.: <br/>Welche beiden Primzahlen sind kleiner bzw. größer als 1 Billiarde? <br/>Antwort: <br/>Es sind  sind die 999.999.999.999.989 und die  1.000.000.000.000.037</li>
</ul><p>Für alle diese Antworten benötigt der <strong>PRIMUS-Server</strong> nicht etwa Minuten, sondern Sekunden bzw. Bruchteile davon - und das auf der Basis eines ""haushaltsüblichen"" Computers.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Die Vision</h3>
<p>Ich habe bereits prototypisch einige Softwareprodukte entwickelt, die es <strong>Menschen in aller Welt</strong> ermöglichen sollen mit PC, Netbook, Tablet-PC und Smartphone, die Funktionen des <strong>PRIMUS-Servers</strong> zu verwenden: mehrere Gadgets, eine Smartphone-App, Web-Services und spezielle Client-Programme für Microsoft-Betriebssysteme.</p>
<p>Hier kannst du den <a href=""http://www.dph-software.de/primus/PCheck"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PrimeChecker</a> ausprobieren. Es ist ein Programm, welches auf Flash Technology basiert.</p>
<p>Über eine eigene Website möchte ich diese Softwareprodukte zum Download anbieten. Für den Privatgebrauch wird die Nutzung der Programme und Dienste in der Regel kostenlos sein. Nach dem Startup soll die zukünftige Finanzierung der Webseite aus freiwilligen Zuwendungen und einem kontrollierten Werbesponsoring erfolgen.</p>
<p>Langfristig strebe ich die Entwicklung industrieller, gewerblicher oder wissenschaftlicher Anwendungen für die <strong>PRIMUS</strong>-Technologie an. <br/><br/>Mit Zahlen können wir das Universum beschreiben - von den Primzahlen können wir etwas über seine Struktur erfahren.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Wofür wird die Unterstützung benötigt</h3>
<p>Das bei Indiegogo eingeworbene Geld wird eingesetzt für:</p>
<ul>
<li>die Anmietung eines dedizierten Servers für 1 Jahr, um die bereits entwickelten und noch geplanten Dienste einer großen Anzahl Interessenten zuverlässig und mit angemessener Geschwindigkeit anbieten zu können. (ca. 600 €)</li>
<li>den Kauf aktueller Computer-Hardware für das gezielte Generieren von Primzahlen in höheren Stellenzahlbereichen. (ca. 1800 €)</li>
<li>den Kauf von Festplattenspeicher, um alle Primzahlen im Bereich bis zu 1 Billiarde (engl. Trillion = 1.000.000.000.000.000, oder anders ausgedrückt alle 15-stelligen Primzahlen) in die Datenbank aufnehmen zu können. (ca. 600 €)</li>
</ul><p>Gelder, die über den Funding-Betrag hinausgehen, werden in den Aufbau der Webseite und die Vervollkommnung der verschiedenen Nutzungsprogramme fließen.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Noch ein bisschen Zahlenwerk</h3>
<p>Meine <strong>PRIMUS-Datenbank</strong> enthält derzeit fast 10,9 Billionen Primzahlen.</p>
<p>Aber was sind schon solche Zahlen? Für die meisten Menschen sind sie nicht sehr aussagekräftig. Was bedeuten schon 13 oder 24 Stellen, wenn man täglich nur mit den Größenordnungen einer Handvoll oder mal eines Hunderters zu tun hat!<br/><br/>Bessere  Vorstellungen liefern Vergleiche bzw. die ""Umrechnung"" auf Erfahrungen,<br/> die jeder im alltäglichen Leben macht z.B.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wenn ein Mensch 1.000 Primzahlen pro Sekunde lesen könnte, <br/>dann würde er für alle enthaltenen Primzahlen ca. 342 Jahre brauchen.<br/>Allerdings kommen momentan in jeder Sekunde ca. 100.000 hinzu ...</li>
<li>Ein PC, der etwa 1 Million Primzahlen pro Sekunde vom <strong>PRIMUS-Server</strong> abrufen könnte, würde dafür immer noch fast viereinhalb Monate benötigen.</li>
<li>Wenn man alle Primzahlen als Ziffern hintereinander in eine Datei schreiben wollte, so wäre diese Datei ca. 140 Terrabyte groß und würde mehr als 340 Festplatten umfassen (à 500 GB - entspricht der gängigen Kapazität von Festplatten, die in PCs verbaut werden) </li>
</ul><h3>
<br/>Unterstützung der anderen Art</h3>
<p>Nicht jede(r) kann finanziell helfen oder findet Primzahlen jetzt schon gut!</p>
<p>Wenn du mich unterstützen willst, so ist auch das Weitersagen eine sehr wertvolle Hilfe. Danke dafür!</p>
<p>Oder vielleicht kennst du Menschen, die sich tatsächlich für solch ein ausgefallenes Projekt interessieren. Dann bringe uns zusammen.</p>

<h3>PRIMUS - World of Primes</h3>
<p>I want to give people, who are interested in mathematics and especially in prime numbers, the chance to participate in a technologie, which I have developed passionately for some years now.</p>
<h4>Why Prime Numbers?</h4>
<p>Prime Numbers are mysterious, sometimes magical -but very difficult to handle if you have large ones or if you need large sets of them, even when working on a computer.</p>
<p>The hunt for the largest known prime number is a different leave - this theme, however, is well-staffed. My project refers to a very large amount of prime numbers and to an as fast as possible access to any of them.</p>
<h3>The Technology</h3>
<p>PRIMUS server offers you a completely new perspectives on primes:</p>
<ul>
<li>as a stream, which one can get ascending or descending from an arbitrary starting point, e.g. <br/>2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 ... <br/>... 37, 31, 29, 23, 19, 17...</li>
<li>as a countable set, that can be accessed indexed by absolute numbers, e.g.<br/> What is the 10 billionth prime? <br/>Answer: It is the prime 252.097.800.623</li>
<li>as reverse function to the last one, e.g. <br/>What number is the prime 123,456,789,012,301? <br/>Answer: Nr. 3,930,144,562,801 (3 trillion 930 billion 144 million ...)</li>
<li>as function like ""Prime number in the vicinity of an arbitrary number"" e.g. <br/>Which two prime numbers are less than or greater than 1,000,000,000,000,000? <br/>Answer: There are  999,999,999,999.989 and 1,000,000,000,000,037  </li>
</ul><p>All this is served in a very fast manner.</p>
<h3>
<br/>The Vision</h3>
<p>I have developed some prototypical software products, which give access to the PRIMUS database and its Server to people all over the world using PC, Netbook, Tablet PC or Smartphone.</p>
<p>Here you can try the <a href=""http://www.dph-software.de/primus/PCheck"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PrimeChecker</a>, which is a program based on flash technology.</p>
<p>Having a website I would like to offer these software products as freeware for to download for private use, Additionally all the services would be free.</p>
<p>After the startup, the future financing of the website would be by voluntary donations and a controlled advertising sponsorship. In the long term I aim at the development of industrial, commercial or scientific applications for the PRIMUS technology.</p>
<p>With numbers we can describe the universe - Of the primes we can learn something about the structure of the universe.</p>
<h3>
<br/>What is the support needed</h3>
<p>The collected money from Indiegogo will be used to</p>
<ul>
<li>rent a dedicated Server for one year, to provide the already developed an planned services for a lot of interested people.</li>
<li>purchase current computer hardware for the targeted generation of prime numbers in higher seating areas (ca. 1800 €)</li>
<li>purchase hard disk space to add all the primes in the field of processing up to one quintillion to the database. (Or in other word: all prime with 15 digits)</li>
</ul><p>Funds that exceed the funding target amount would be invested in the construction of the website and the perfection of the various programs.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Here are a few figures</h3>
<p>The PRIMUS database currently contains more than 11 trillion (11.000.000.000.000) prime numbers.<br/>But what are those numbers? For most people, they are not very meaningful. What are already 13 or 24 digits, if in everyday life you only have to handle magnitudes of a handful or perhaps some hundreds.<br/>Here, comparisons and the ""conversion"" into everyday experiences give a better imagination, e.g.:  </p>
<ul>
<li>If a person could read 1000 primes per second, then he would need approximately 342 years for all primes. However, iat the time every second about 100,000 primes are added.</li>
<li>A PC that could get about 1 million primes per second from PRIMUS server, would still need almost four and a half months.</li>
<li>If you wanted to write all the prime numbers in a row as numbers in a file, that file would be about 140 terabytes in size. That would be more than 340 hard drives with 500 GB<br/> </li>
</ul><h3>Support of the other kind</h3>
<p>Not everybody can spend money or is a real prime-lover after reading my issues.  </p>
<p>But, you can support me by telling it to others - this would be a worthful help. <br/>Thank your for that! <br/>Perhaps you know people, which are in deed interested in Mathematics and especially prime numbers or theorie of numbers.  </p>
<h3>
<br/>The Perks</h3>
<p><strong>10 $  PRIMUS Certificate Bronze</strong><br/>You get a PRIMUS Supporter Certificate by E-Mail</p>
<p><strong>20 $ PRIMUS Certificate Silver</strong><br/>You get a PRIMUS Supporter Certificate by E-Mail which contains your name</p>

rent a dedicated Server for one year, to provide the already developed an planned services for a lot of interested people.
purchase current computer hardware for the targeted generation of prime numbers in higher seating areas (ca. 1800 €)
purchase hard disk space to add all the primes in the field of processing up to one quintillion to the database. (Or in other word: all prime with 15 digits)
Funds that exceed the funding target amount would be invested in the construction of the website and the perfection of the various programs.

Here are a few figures
The PRIMUS database currently contains more than 11 trillion (11.000.000.000.000) prime numbers.But what are those numbers? For most people, they are not very meaningful. What are already 13 or 24 digits, if in everyday life you only have to handle magnitudes of a handful or perhaps some hundreds.Here, comparisons and the ""conversion"" into everyday experiences give a better imagination, e.g.:  

If a person could read 1000 primes per second, then he would need approximately 342 years for all primes. However, iat the time every second about 100,000 primes are added.
A PC that could get about 1 million primes per second from PRIMUS server, would still need almost four and a half months.
If you wanted to write all the prime numbers in a row as numbers in a file, that file would be about 140 terabytes in size. That would be more than 340 hard drives with 500 GB 
Support of the other kind
Not everybody can spend money or is a real prime-lover after reading my issues.  
But, you can support me by telling it to others - this would be a worthful help. Thank your for that! Perhaps you know people, which are in deed interested in Mathematics and especially prime numbers or theorie of numbers.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I am Peter Murray. I am part of the global 'skirt's for men' movement.   About 150 years ago, skirts, lace and colour were a common part of the male fashion range.   Today, some cultures retain skirted garments as a male fashion item.   These include kilts in Scotland, Ireland and Wales, the sarong in south and southeast Asia, the Greek fustanella, the dhoti or lungi in India and the lava-lava in Samoa.</p>
<p>Not so many years ago, women gained the fashion freedom to routinely wear pants, slacks or shorts.</p>
<p>Now is the time for men to gain their fashion freedom and reclaim the skirt as a fashion choice.</p>
<p>However, men are not the same shape as women and have different preferences on design including pockets, belt loops and front openings.</p>
<p>There are some businesses marketing skirt's for men, most of these are based on the kilt or garments designed for women but marketed as unisex.</p>
<p>My plan is to design and market a range of skirts specifically for men and also establish a label or term globally recognised to refer to the skirt for men, The Freeman.</p>
<p>I am a family man who does not have a history in the commercial fashion industry and does not have the financial capacity to complete this project.</p>
<p>I am launching this campaign to help fund the design and pattern making costs, the graphic and web design cost and other costs to take the project up to the global launch point.</p>

<p>The major difficulty with breastfeeding is to know in real-time how much your baby has nursed, for some psychological and physiological malnutrition may occur.

<p>With <em>Feed</em>Art's application, for the first time, your baby may nurse freely while you are able to keep track of the quantities he eats while he eats.</p>
<p>This newly designed digital gadget presents accurate detailed information on your Smartphone which you can also share on-line with the baby's Doctor and your breastfeeding consultant, regarding each breastfeeding cycle.</p>
<p>It keeps historical data and comparable to past breastfeeding and common averages for the baby's age.</p>
<p>Your innovative <em>Feed</em>Art will show you information needed concerning your baby's feeds such as: Quantities, flow, amount per breastfeeding comparable breastfeeding history and more will be graphically presented on your Smartphone screen.</p>

</h3><p> </p><p>  <b>In seconds</b>, switch from ice skates to inline roller skates, quad skates, alpine skis, nordic skis, snowshoes, snowboards, even water skis, wakeboards or swimfins, all using the <b>same comfortable footwear</b> you wore from home.  <b>No separate, bulky boots</b> to lug around and change into; just snap in and enjoy!</p><p>   I'm Gordon Belles; with my background in mechanical engineering and product development, I started <b>American Independence Technologies LLC</b> to create products which help us be our best, instead of exploiting our weaknesses.  The ""<b>Empowerment Engineering</b>"" principles (discussed below), which aid in this, include versatility, efficiency, interchangeability/modularity and economy, featured traits of the <b>KwikFoot</b>(tm) attachment system, the first of our concepts being readied for market.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Let's make this happen!</h3><p></p><h4><br/></h4><h4>The short story: </h4><p>   Time is very short!  We must raise <b>the first $1,000 the next few days</b> to keep our patent application alive, and a minimum of another $15,000 for legal work by mid-January.  The remainder, after fees and perks - $43,218.00 - will be needed to realistically continue prototyping (of additional footwear and more variety of equipment - skis, snowboard, snowshoes, etc.), retire related debt and free some time to work with potential licensees.  <br/>   If funds are sufficient, I would also very much like to take the time to begin a <b>discussion forum</b> on Empowerment Engineering, and get more people aware and involved in working out just which properties of products actually help us reach toward our potential (see below).<br/></p><h4>The project so far: </h4><p>   I've taken KwikFoot(tm) from concept to optimized <b>configuration</b>, built the working <b>prototype </b>shown in the video above (using inline skates as the demonstrated equipment), filed and followed up on <b>application for U.S. patent</b> protection (to secure limited-time exclusive rights to several unique aspects of the design), and have been <b>seeking licensees</b> for manufacture and distribution.<br/></p><h4>Expenditures:</h4><p>   to this point these include over <b>$1,400</b> in prototyping equipment and materials (fabrication was done by me; man-hours included below), and <b>$21,218</b> in legal and patent office fees ($16,485 already paid, plus $4733 still owed), additional expenses of about <b>$1,200</b> (office supplies and equipment, presentation materials, travel to present to licensee candidates, etc.), and well over <b>5,000 man-hours</b> in research, design, prototyping, patent preparation (working with Barnes &amp; Thornburg), preparing presentation materials, and communication with potential licensees.  <br/>   These have stretched both my time and our finances to the limits.  In addition, a flood this summer destroyed my milling equipment, saws and other fabrication tools (some previously owned, some purchased for this project).  The damage was only partly covered by insurance, and these items will need replacing before further prototyping.  This will require about <b>$2500</b>.<br/></p><h4>Licensing Status:</h4><p>   I have approached a number of manufacturers as potential licensees; several of these have expressed interest, but so far have been unable to commit to production with patent still pending (not yet granted).  With recent strain on finances, I've been unable to put much time into scouting and developing licensee prospects.</p><p></p><h4>Patent Status:</h4><p>   Why time is so urgent: the patent examiner issued the first ""office action"" (evaluation of the patent application) early last year, flatly denying a patent, saying each of the features we claim are contained in some existing inventions (""prior art"").  Some examiners do this routinely, putting burden of proof on the inventor to specify how his invention is different from each prior art cited.<br/>   My patent attorney and I responded, correcting some minor technical errors the examiner cited, and pointing out specifically how the features of my invention differ from the prior art.<br/>   To our surprise, the examiner basically ignored the content of our response and re-asserted that each of these features was contained in the prior art specified, and promptly made this second office action final, leaving an appeal the only real recourse.<br/>   My attorney and I both believe we have <b>very strong grounds for appeal</b>, but without additional financing, we've been unable to make that case.  With the flood this summer and a downturn at my day-job, I still owe the attorney for much of the first (unexpectely in-depth - and expensive) office action response.<br/>   Below, you'll find full information on the grounds for the patent appeal; we hope you'll decide this is worth your supporting.<br/></p><p></p><h4>Financial Status:</h4><p>   Having only recently discovered crowdfunding, I've been feverishly assembling a campaign here to beat the Dec. 24 <b>deadline for response</b>.  My attorney needs a day or two to prepare this response, so really the <b>$1000 retainer</b> would be needed no later than <b>Monday the 23rd</b>, if not sooner!  I'll be calling him soon to firm up  that deadline and post an update as soon as we know.<br/></p><p></p><h4>Where do we go from here?</h4><p>   If we succeed in getting patent protection, the fact that you all will have helped this happen will be a strong selling point to any potential licensees; not only will we have patent protection, but we also can show a ready-made, enthusiastic market!  Your support not only helps with patenting, it can help convince a manufacturer to commit to production and marketing!<br/>   And we definitely want to hear any <b>feedback </b>you have about the KwikFoot(tm) roll-out, the whole idea of Empowerment Engineering, or the Indiegogo campaign itself.  For instance: how much of your support do you want to go to pay for perks?  We have budgeted about 5% for <b>perks.</b>  A few starter perks are shown below; we want to provide tangible reminders of our gratitude, and ways to show your active interest and involvement, and to get others to be aware and involved.  Please let us know what you'd like to see!<br/>   Of course, patent approval is never guaranteed, raising the question: if we fail to raise the amount necessary for an appeal, or if the appeal is finally denied, what next?  We do need to retire the debt from the patent work to-date, and I have a host of other projects in the wings;

</h4><p>   While operating computer labs at Purdue University, I was struck by the way students would leave a classroom building (where wearing skates is not allowed, or practical, since stairs are involved), find a place to sit, pull bulky inline skates (with integral boots) from a large bag, remove their shoes, put on and adjust the skates, put their shoes in the bag, and finally take off to skate to their next class; where they had to reverse the whole process!<br/></p><p>   This of course sparked the old TMBABW response from me (There Must Be A Better Way!), and got me thinking of what would be needed to have a separate skate frame which attaches to a flexible-soled boot which could be worn for normal walking. <br/></p><p>   So, the design process began: design goals, priorities and parameters were defined, the state of the art was studied, and creative configurations generated (the fun part!).  Then these were narrowed down to the most optimal concept, and this was refined through the prototype process, with results shown in the video above. <br/></p><p>   I soon realized the solution: having rigid, clog-resistant attachment points in heel and forefoot could provide the flexible-soled boot with the rigidity needed for skating.  Also, giving each attachment point its own independent lock-up meant we could provide <b>selective rigidity</b> for such a boot.  Skates and alpine skis could fix the boot soles in rigid lockup, while Nordic skis, snowshoes or stretching equipment could lock in only the forefoot or heel, allowing the same boot to flex.  And in all cases, once the equipment is remove, the boot can flex like normal footwear (a big avantage over, say, ski boots!).<br/></p><p>  After researching prior art and finalizing a configuration, I purchased equipment and materials, and fabricated the prototype shown in the video above.  Testing shows the attachment to be rigid and strong, allowing full skating maneuvers without wobble or fear of breakage.  The horizontal attachment slots are also self-clearing: a big advantage over attachment systems which insert vertically and leave debris with nowhere to go.  Easily clogging as they are, they make walking in mud or gravel impractical.  KwikFoot(tm) has no such limitation.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/265579/files/20131217062245-12_Boot_-Flex.JPG?1387290165"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p><b>Demonstrating flexible sole.</b><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/265589/files/20131217062827-31_Catch_Detail.JPG?1387290507"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Components Visible</b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/265602/files/20131217063753-52_Insert_Partial.JPG?1387291073"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>Partial Insertion</b><p></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/265607/files/20131217064334-53_Insert_Full.JPG?1387291414"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p><p><b>Full Insertion (locked in place)</b><br/></p><p></p><p>   KwikFoot(tm) fulfills its design objectives: now you don't have to lug around bulky, expensive, specialized boots for each piece of equipment you want to use, or waste time changing footwear and adjusting the fit each time you attach or remove the equipment.  Also, each piece of equipment provides the boot with the right degree of rigiity neee for that application.  With mix-and-match interchangeability, it provides convenience, versatility and economy.</p><h4>Patenting Process:<br/>

</ul><h4>Basis for Our Appeal:<br/>
</h4><p>   The <b>examiner maintains</b> that <b>Pratt contains all the elements</b> of our independent claims, specifically that:</p><p>  ""The sole is configured to be releasably coupled by a substantially <b>rigid connection</b> with a plurality of footwear-mounted devices.  The forefoot and heel receivers are adapted to be <b>coupled in locking engagement</b> with a footwear-mounted device <b>independent of each other</b>"" (boldface not original).<br/></p><p>  However, the heel receiver disclosed by Pratt is a vertical cylindrical opening which does have a catch, but this retains a connector which is a <b>cylindrical vertical post</b>, and is still<b> free to rotate </b>within the receiver <b>unless restrained by the forefoot </b>connection, thus this does <b>not </b>constitute a substantially <b>rigid connection independent</b> of the forefoot receiver, as required by our claims.</p><p>  A further dependent claim of ours does specify the insertion motion to be ""substantially coplanar with the sole"" (horizontal), which is another distinction from Pratt's heel receiver, yet even this was also rejected by the examiner.</p><p>  Also, Pratt discloses a forefoot receiver which is a longitudinal slot <b>without any locking mechanism, save the rear</b> longitudinal stop provided by the heel receiver, which means it specifically <b>can not</b> be coupled in locking engagement <b>independent</b> of the heel receiver, as required by our claims.<br/></p><p>  Thus, we believe the independent claim was <b>not </b>anticipated by Pratt, and likewise the remaining claims were objected to on even shakier grounds, citing combinations of obscure aspects of unrelated patents with differing objectives, as being ""obvious"" to be combined. These other cited patents are Marechal (6,270,089 B1) and Wu (6,042,125).<br/></p><p>  Answers to these objections were included in our response to the first office action, though perhaps need to be made even more explicit, and will require an appeal process, since the examiner seems unwilling to reconsider the position of the first office action, and there is no time remaining for anything but a notice to appeal anyway.<br/><br/></p><h3>How you can help:</h3><p><br/>   Again, we're almost out of time to act.  If you believe in what we're trying to do, or would just like to see some cool new sporting equipment on the market, <b>please contribute immediately</b> if you can; any amount will help.<br/></p><p>   And <b>even if you can't</b> contribute, <b>you can still help</b> by <b>spreading the word</b> to your friends/chat groups/contacts and asking them to do the same!  Indiegogo has handy social media sharing tools you can put in your tweets, facebook pages, etc. to get the word out, and once it snowballs, great things can happen quickly (which is exactly what's needed!).  Please point people to: <b><a href=""http://www.igg.me/at/KwikFoot/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.igg.me/at/KwikFoot/</a></b> to find this campaign.<br/></p><p>   <b>Thank you so much</b> for helping any way you can!  Working together, Lord willing, we can actually bring KwikFoot(tm) to reality and make fun and fitness more convenient and accessible to all!  <br/><br/></p></div>","NOTE: we didn't make our first-tier goal, so we're suspending fund-raising...  Thank you to everyone who has shared this site and especially to those who've contributed.  Apparently there simply wasn't time to gain enough interest to fund the patent appeal, so as of Dec. 24th, the patent application has now gone abandoned.  This means patent protection is now unavailable, and the concept is now ""public-domain""; no-one can now have exclusive rights to the technology, which makes it harder to interest a manufacturer, and harder yet to secure royalties.   Please share any comments you have about the KwikFoot(tm) design or any aspect of the Empowerment Engineering concept.  Again, thank you so much for your interest.  KwikFoot(tm): fitness and fun without the hassle!
   In seconds, switch from ice skates to inline roller skates, quad skates, alpine skis, nordic skis, snowshoes, snowboards, even water skis, wakeboards or swimfins, all using the same comfortable footwear you wore from home.  No separate, bulky boots to lug around and change into; just snap in and enjoy!   I'm Gordon Belles; with my background in mechanical engineering and product development, I started American Independence Technologies LLC to create products which help us be our best, instead of exploiting our weaknesses.  The ""Empowerment Engineering"" principles (discussed below), which aid in this, include versatility, efficiency, interchangeability/modularity and economy, featured traits of the KwikFoot(tm) attachment system, the first of our concepts being readied for market.Let's make this happen!The short story:    Time is very short!  We must raise the first $1,000 the next few days to keep our patent application alive, and a minimum of another $15,000 for legal work by mid-January.  The remainder, after fees and perks - $43,218.00 - will be needed to realistically continue prototyping (of additional footwear and more variety of equipment - skis, snowboard, snowshoes, etc.), retire related debt and free some time to work with potential licensees.     If funds are sufficient, I would also very much like to take the time to begin a discussion forum on Empowerment Engineering, and get more people aware and involved in working out just which properties of products actually help us reach toward our potential (see below).The project so far:    I've taken KwikFoot(tm) from concept to optimized configuration, built the working prototype shown in the video above (using inline skates as the demonstrated equipment), filed and followed up on application for U.S. patent protection (to secure limited-time exclusive rights to several unique aspects of the design), and have been seeking licensees for manufacture and distribution.Expenditures:   to this point these include over $1,400 in prototyping equipment and materials (fabrication was done by me; man-hours included below), and $21,218 in legal and patent office fees ($16,485 already paid, plus $4733 still owed), additional expenses of about $1,200 (office supplies and equipment, presentation materials, travel to present to licensee candidates, etc.), and well over 5,000 man-hours in research, design, prototyping, patent preparation (working with Barnes & Thornburg), preparing presentation materials, and communication with potential licensees.     These have stretched both my time and our finances to the limits.  In addition, a flood this summer destroyed my milling equipment, saws and other fabrication tools (some previously owned, some purchased for this project).  The damage was only partly covered by insurance, and these items will need replacing before further prototyping.  This will require about $2500.Licensing Status:   I have approached a number of manufacturers as potential licensees; several of these have expressed interest, but so far have been unable to commit to production with patent still pending (not yet granted).  With recent strain on finances, I've been unable to put much time into scouting and developing licensee prospects.Patent Status:   Why time is so urgent: the patent examiner issued the first ""office action"" (evaluation of the patent application) early last year, flatly denying a patent, saying each of the features we claim are contained in some existing inventions (""prior art"").  Some examiners do this routinely, putting burden of proof on the inventor to specify how his invention is different from each prior art cited.   My patent attorney and I responded, correcting some minor technical errors the examiner cited, and pointing out specifically how the features of my invention differ from the prior art.   To our surprise, the examiner basically ignored the content of our response and re-asserted that each of these features was contained in the prior art specified, and promptly made this second office action final, leaving an appeal the only real recourse.   My attorney and I both believe we have very strong grounds for appeal, but without additional financing, we've been unable to make that case.  With the flood this summer and a downturn at my day-job, I still owe the attorney for much of the first (unexpectely in-depth - and expensive) office action response.   Below, you'll find full information on the grounds for the patent appeal; we hope you'll decide this is worth your supporting.Financial Status:   Having only recently discovered crowdfunding, I've been feverishly assembling a campaign here to beat the Dec. 24 deadline for response.  My attorney needs a day or two to prepare this response, so really the $1000 retainer would be needed no later than Monday the 23rd, if not sooner!  I'll be calling him soon to firm up  that deadline and post an update as soon as we know.Where do we go from here?   If we succeed in getting patent protection, the fact that you all will have helped this happen will be a strong selling point to any potential licensees; not only will we have patent protection, but we also can show a ready-made, enthusiastic market!  Your support not only helps with patenting, it can help convince a manufacturer to commit to production and marketing!   And we definitely want to hear any feedback you have about the KwikFoot(tm) roll-out, the whole idea of Empowerment Engineering, or the Indiegogo campaign itself.  For instance: how much of your support do you want to go to pay for perks?  We have budgeted about 5% for perks.  A few starter perks are shown below; we want to provide tangible reminders of our gratitude, and ways to show your active interest and involvement, and to get others to be aware and involved.  Please let us know what you'd like to see!   Of course, patent approval is never guaranteed, raising the question: if we fail to raise the amount necessary for an appeal, or if the appeal is finally denied, what next?  We do need to retire the debt from the patent work to-date, and I have a host of other projects in the wings; but we would still need to determine whether to continue to try to get KwikFoot(tm) manufactured without patent protection, try to go into production ourselves, or move on to another project.  If this should happen, your input would be invaluable to help us choose the right path.  Where your support will go:  $1,000.00   -retainer for attorney's response (needed by Dec.19)$15,000.00   -retainer for Patent Office Appeal   $4733.00   -outstanding patent attorney balance$16,485.00   -outstanding debt from previous legal fees$10,000.00   -further prototyping (equipment replacement, materials, labor) $10,000.00   -licensee contact: time, travel and promotional materials  $2,000.00   -set up website/blog/discussion forum on Empowerment Engineering   $3117.00   -perks: about 2% to thank you and help spread the word!  $2,597.00   -indiegogo's campaign fee   $64,932.00   -TOTALAny additional amounts will go toward future projects, as well as any unanticipated expenses involved in bringing KwikFoot(tm) to market.                    My passion: Empowerment Engineering

<p>Yes, you can record video for as long as you want - there is no limit on the size of your video file recording.  The camera is ""dual mode"": it can be used regularly to record video/snap photos with the built-in control buttons or using the smartphone app; or you can set it to advanced recording modes such as Timelapse Photo/Video, AutoEdit, and Car loop mode.  ""The last five minutes"" refers to an optional, advanced feature of the camera allowing you to save video after the fact. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>2. How do I control my Perfect Memory camera?</b></p>
<p>Either with the built in buttons that allow you to power on the camera, record video or snap photos, or with the free companion iOS/Android app.</p>

<p><b>4. What is the battery lifetime of the camera and how quickly does it recharge?</b></p>
<p>The 1,000 mAh battery take 1.5 hours to recharge.  Depending on the mode of use, you can operate the camera for several days without needing to recharge.

<p> </p>
<p><b>5. Does it have sound?</b></p>
<p>Yes, it has audio with the built-in microphone.</p>
<p><b>6. Are the Silver Metal and the Rose Gold Limited Edition Metal cameras the same model, apart from the different finishes?</b></p>

<p><b>7. How to I set the camera and are the settings saved after the camera powers off?</b></p>
<p>Yes, the settings you save to the camera using the companion iOS/Android app will be saved in the camera's memory so you will not need to set them again upon powering on the camera.</p>
<p><b>8. How many settings can I run at one time? </b></p>
<p>You can set your camera to one mode of operation at any given time - for example regular recording, Timelapse, AutoEdit, car DVR loop mode.  You can always snap either a photo or record a video of any length.</p>
<p><b>9. What is AutoEdit and what is patented about it?</b></p>
<p>AutoEdit is a proprietary advanced mode that you can select to tap the camera to save up to the last five minutes of video (you can also change the duration). It is exclusively available only with the Perfect Memory camera under a new, recently issued United State utility patent. </p>
<p><b>10. How do I set the camera to Timelapse modes?</b></p>
<p>You can set the camera to do Photo or Video timelapses using the companion iOS/Android app, to the time intervals of your choice.</p>
<p><b>11. How do you attach the camera to different surfaces?</b></p>
<p>With the accessories, you will be able to turn any number of surfaces into a photo/video ""booth"". </p>
<p><b>12. How do you attach the camera to sports action mounts?</b></p>
<p>With the sports action mount frame shown above that will be optionally offered to those that would like to use it, you will be able to attach the camera to any sports action mount.  </p>
<p><b>13. Can it be used as a pet wearable camera and how?</b></p>
<p>Yes, it is easily attachable to dogs, and even cats.  The camera lens is stable so you will be able to see in superb quality what your loved pet is up to. </p>
<p><b>14. Is the camera lightweight and how much does it weigh?</b></p>
<p>Yes, it is lightweight, and weighs 1.8oz or about 52 grams.</p>
<p><b>15. How is the camera different from a GoPro?</b></p>
<p>GoPro has several models, its newest model is the Session.  The Perfect Memory camera is 2-3x smaller than the Session, made out of a luxury metal build, sleek, and features AutoEdit. It can be worn and used in ways the GoPro cannot, without sacrificing quality for size or versatility, while compatible with all GoPro's line of action mounts and accessories.</p>
<p><b>16. How is the camera different from the Narrative Clip 2?</b></p>
<p>1) Superior video quality than the Narrative Clip 2 - the A7LS75 chipset; 2) Build quality; 3) Your choice of modes; 4) AutoEdit recall feature; 5) You can use it with its sports action mounts; 6) Larger memory capacity; 7) Built-in audio microphone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>17. What is Perfect Memory?</b></p>
<p>Perfect Memory is the ability to recall images with vividness bordering on actual visual perception; ""total recall""; also called ""photographic memory"".</p>

<p>The camera allows you to save video after the fact, ie ""go back in time"" to save the events that already happened with the patented AutoEdit video.  Also, the camera takes the pain out of video recording on the go to help capture the perfect ""moments"" and perfect ""memories"".</p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">19. Which microSD card should I use?</b></p>
<p>We've had users try a PNY 64GB class 10 microSD card and they have reported problems with it.  We therefore recommend to use a 16/32GB class 10 microSD card, and not to use a 64GB or higher card as we assess the issue.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong><i>1. When will the smartwatch be shipped?</i></strong></p>
<p>We will begin shipping devices in July 2017. Check back on our <a href=""http://www.ibeat.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> and our Indiegogo page for the latest updates!</p>
<p><i><strong>2. How much will the monthly monitoring cost?</strong></i></p>
<p>After your free year of monitoring, the iBeat watch monthly monitoring fee will be $17. There is no commitment to sign up, but should you choose to continue the monitoring service, we will notify you that your service needs renewal, and you or a family member can pay this via credit card, PayPal, or check on our secure, online dashboard. We will also support automatic payments and split payments between friends/family members.</p>
<p><i><strong>3. How does the watch work?</strong></i></p>
<p>Hypersensitive PPG (photoplethysmogram) sensors continually monitor your heart for life-threatening emergencies, particularly ones that could cause sudden cardiac arrest or a heart attack. The device will be calibrated to each individual user's heartbeat so we can set a proper baseline for what constitutes as a “normal range"" and what constitutes as “life-threatening.” If the device detects an oncoming life-threatening incident, it will ask the user if he or she is okay. If the user selects ‘No’ or is unresponsive for more than ten seconds, iBeat will notify the user’s emergency contacts and if necessary, 911. The watch will always ask you if you're having an emergency before taking action to dispatch 911. If it's a false alarm, you'll have ten seconds to tap the watch and say you're okay before we escalate.</p>
<p><i><strong>4. How can I select which color device I want?</strong></i></p>
<p>At the end of the campaign, we will reach out to you via email and you may select your iBeat watch color choice(s).</p>
<p><i><strong>5. Who can wear the iBeat Life Monitor?</strong></i></p>
<p>The iBeat watch strap can be adjusted ensuring a comfortable fit for wrists of all sizes, but the current version of the iBeat Life Monitor works best on wrists at least 5 inches or larger in circumference.</p>
<p><i><strong>6. Do I need a cell phone or cellular plan to use this?</strong></i></p>
<p>No, the iBeat watch has built-in cellular connectivity and is included in the monthly monitoring service fee.</p>
<p><i><strong>7. What conditions does the iBeat Life Monitor detect for?</strong></i></p>
<p>Our medical-grade sensors continually monitor your heart for slowing, stopping, or irregular beating that may trigger a life-threatening emergency. The device will be calibrated to each individual user's heart beat so we can make sure we set a proper baseline for what constitutes ""normal"". For those with an above-average heart rate due to A-fib, for example, we can set the emergency threshold a bit higher or lower depending on the user’s preference. Additionally, the watch will always ask you if you're having an emergency before taking action to dispatch 911. If it's a false alarm, you'll have ten seconds to tap the watch and say you're okay before we escalate. The device is not intended to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent any disease or condition, but is rather a notification device that can immediately alert family, loved ones, and emergency respondents in the case of an emergency.</p>
<p><i><strong>8. Can people with pacemakers use this?</strong></i></p>
<p>The iBeat watch operates similar to a cell phone and users with pacemakers should follow guidance from their doctor. It is not meant to replace your pacemaker or defibrillator.</p>
<p><i><strong>9. How do the family and friend member alerts work?</strong></i></p>
<p>When you buy an iBeat, you may set up your emergency contacts in our online dashboard. In the case of an emergency, your contacts will be notified via text message, or a call from our dispatch team.</p>
<p><i><strong>10. How does the battery charging work?</strong></i></p>
<p>The iBeat watch lasts 5-7 days before needing to be recharged. The device comes with an attachable battery that easily clips on to the side of the watch face, allowing you to wear the watch 24-7, even while charging it. The iBeat Life Monitor only takes one hour to charge. Once your device is fully charged, the battery pack can be plugged into a wall outlet or your USB drive. </p>
<p><i><strong>11. I’m not tech savvy. Is it easy to set up and use?</strong></i></p>
<p>Very easy! The iBeat watch comes with large-font, easy-to-follow instructions for setup, and should take no longer than five minutes to get up and running.</p>
<p><i><strong>12. Can I shower or swim with it?</strong></i></p>
<p>Yes! The iBeat watch is meant to be worn 24/7 so it is water resistant and can be worn while showering, surfing, swimming, bathing, washing your hands, partaking in ice bucket challenges, etc.</p>
<p><i><strong>13. Does the watch offer any integration with texting, calendar, tasks, etc. that other smartwatches have?</strong></i></p>
<p>The iBeat watchwas designed to be a stylish timepiece that can save your life. It does not come pre-loaded with apps, or notify you of calls or text messages like other smartwatches. Instead, it functions more like a traditional watch with added features including customized watch faces, tracking your steps, setting an alarm or a timer, while continually monitoring and analyzing your heart for oncoming life-threatening emergencies. </p>
<p><i><strong>14. What if you are wearing the device in a no cell coverage area? Will it still work?</strong></i></p>
<p>The iBeat watch does not need cell coverage to continually monitor and analyze your heart rate, but in an emergency, the device's ability to contact our dispatch team and 911 is dependent on cell connection. Should you happen to be in a no coverage area during an emergency, the device can send out an audible beacon that can alert anyone in your local area.</p>
<p><i><strong>15. Is it safe to wear on my wrist all day and night?</strong></i></p>
<p>Of course! The iBeat watch was designed to be worn around-the-clock, and it's an FCC and carrier-certified device that transmits far less frequencies than a standard cell phone. The sensor technology has been thoroughly tested, and it is completely safe to wear on your wrist and skin.</p>
<p><i><strong>16. Does the device support multiple profiles so that it can be used or shared by more than one person?</strong></i></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the iBeat watch is a single profile device. When you receive your iBeat, the device will analyze you routine heart rate rhythms and patterns and calibrate itself accordingly. This is how we establish a safe baseline, and also why we offer the iBeat Family Deal...you get two devices for a steal of a deal!</p>
<p><i><strong>17. Are there plans to offer different colored straps and bands in the near future?</strong></i></p>
<p>Absolutely! The first version of the iBeat watch will come with a standard black or white silicone-based band that can be adjusted to your wrist size. We plan to add more bands in different colors and materials sometime next year.</p>
<p><i><strong>18. I'm worried about false alarms. Can I control, or turn off the 911 alerts?</strong></i></p>
<p>In the event of an emergency, the iBeat watch will always ask you if you're having an emergency before taking action to dispatch 911. If it's a false alarm, you'll have ten seconds to tap the watch and say you're okay before we escalate. Additionally, the watch will notify our dispatch team who can then field the call to 911, preventing any unnecessary false 911 calls.</p>
<p><i><strong>19. Will I be able to access my health data and share with my doctor?</strong></i></p>
<p>You, your doctor, or anyone else that you authorize may access our secure online dashboard where you can view your data data including your daily, weekly, and monthly heart rates and patterns, as well as download the raw data.</p>
<p><i><strong>20. Does iBeat work internationally or offer multi-language support, and where do you ship?</strong></i></p>
<p>Currently, the iBeat watch is only available in the United States, but we are happy to ship your device anywhere around the world. In the near future, we plan to offer an international version of iBeat with multi-language support.</p>
<p><i><strong>21. What is the return policy?</strong></i></p>
<p>If you or a family member do not feel safer wearing this device, simply return it within 90 days, no questions asked, and we will refund your money.</p>
<p><i><strong>22. How do I buy?</strong></i></p>

</div></div>","The iBeat Heart Alert & Emergency Watch is a sleek and stylish smart watch that can save your life. By perpetually monitoring for oncoming life-threatening heart incidents such as cardiac arrest (a sudden, sometimes temporary, cessation of heart function) or atrial fibrillation (an irregular, often rapid heart rate that can cause poor blood flow and lead to stroke), the iBeat Heart Alert & Emergency Watch ensures you receive immediate care in the event of a life-threatening emergency. We are still preparing for manufacturing so your early purchase gives you a 70% discount and a free year of monitoring.

<p><b>Our Idea?</b></p>
<p>Every
day we come across lot of people wearing oddly fitted clothing. There
is no option for them, except buying what many popular brands offer. It is like
a black and white movie. Nobody stands out. We can change that. YOU can change
that. We strongly feel that every man and woman is unique and this uniqueness
should be reflected on the clothing range they wear. So, we ask you, are you ready for
a change? </p>
<p>Let’s
change then! We want men and women around the globe to be able to design their
own apparel and flaunt them. Wearing dresses is a basic
necessity of life and can also be used to express your unique style. But have
you noticed how you pick up your styling? You are often overlooked in a sea of
mass produced trends. We don´t want this to keep happening to people, especially
to you!</p>
<p>We
want to bring the power of custom design and fit options to your fingertips and

Transform Fashion Now
We’re producing volumes and volumes of clothing to  meet current trends but we’re not putting any emphasis on the importance of how we treat the people or the planet on the process of making these things. If we don't stop this immediately, we're not going to be able to keep on living like we do now.Fashion Positive partners with brands and designers and their supply chain partners to create better materials for clothing that do not harm people or the planet in the process of making and producing. It's not easy to accomplish these big goals alone—so we created a movement.

The fashion industry is one of the most harmful and wasteful in the world. 

How is Fashion Positive fixing the problem?





Claire Vivier

Fashion Positive is powered by Cradle to Cradle Certified™, the most comprehensive program in the world that guides designers and manufacturers to make products in fundamentally better ways. 
Cradle to Cradle is a design methodology that says everything we use should be looked at as a nutrient for a future cycle.



Cradle to Cradle ensures that positive impact is made in five key areas:

Why Do We Need This Money?



We are collaborating with leading designers and brands, including G-Star RAW, Stella McCartney, Loomstate, Bionic Yarn, Belk department stores and their supply chain partners who will create better manufacturing processes and materials for our clothing. DOEN Foundation of the Dutch Postcode Lottery in the Nethelands in partnership with Wendy and Eric Schmidt have already provided the beginning balance to fund these initial projects. WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT TO RAISE AN ADDITIONAL $100,000 AND COMPLETE FUNDING NEEDED FOR THESE PROJECTS.
THIS $100,000 WILL:

A.  Provide much needed innovation funding for 2-3 project partners who make materials  for apparel (e.g., yarns, fabrics, buttons, zippers, dyes, etc..).  
B.  Examples of how the money will be used are:
     i.   Optimize a mill's renewable energy profile.
     ii.  Improvements to current water and filtration system or other means for ensuring the recycling of clean water into the facility and providing clean effluent to local systems.  
     iii.   Creation of projects which improve social practices at the facility level, thus impacting the lives of workers and local community (e.g. education, training, fair wage, human rights, women's rights, etc...).
     iv.  Invest in materials take back, recycling or upcycling programs within the facilities, brands, retailers or across the entire supply chain  (e.g. creating a system for fibers to be recollected and spun into future yarns).
    v.   Green chemistry needs  (e.g. spur research and development for new innovations in better dyes, pigments and processing chemicals to lesson impact on people and planet).
Every dollar you donate will be used to ensure that these supply chain partners have the means to create better materials for our clothes.



$1 to $1 Match

We only need $100,000 to complete the balance needed to begin this work. Wendy and Eric Schmidt have generously committed to matching dollar-for-dollar every dollar you give. We need to raise $50,000 to be matched by Wendy and Eric Schmidt, totaling $100,000 needed to begin this important work. That's a total of $100,000

a dream that they want to achieve. A special dream that they want to change

dream to travel to all parts of the world. Some dreams are as simple as
bringing happiness to the people around them. Likewise, I am a dreamer too. My
dream combines these dreams; my dream is to be free, to travel, and to bring
happiness to others. I dream to be able to be free and without restrictions, to
travel to all parts of the world, and to bring happiness wherever I go. My
dream is DVa 2.</p>
<h4> <b>What exactly is DVa 2?</b>
</h4><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433259104/f3yxrqtokcn7ptbxdwkh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">DVa 2 is a 2 in 1 shoe designed to suit males of all ages. In
a blink of an eye, you can transform a classy pair of shoes into a fashionable
pair of sandals. Do you find yourselves going through the hassle, visiting shop
after shop to look for a good-looking pair of shoes to suit your fashion style?
DVa 2 is perfect for formal to semi-formal to even causal wear! DVa 2 is what
you are looking for to match every occasion.</span><br/></p></div>
<p>You are free to create your very own shoe, with DVa 2. Be it
dressing up for formal events or dressing down for an informal outing with
friends, DVa 2 matches every occasion! Everyone can afford to own a pair of DVa
2. By purchasing a pair of DVa 2, you automatically gain 2 pairs instead of 1!</p>
<p>DVa 2 will not be limited by the boundaries created by
countries. DVa 2 will be able to reach every part of the world and will be made
available to everyone. With DVa 2, you will never have to worry if your attire
matches your shoes. You can simply make your shoes match what you are wearing, every
single day. </p>
<p><b>Who Am I....</b></p><p>I am Winston Tan, the creator of DVa 2. I aim to be a full-fledged
designer that features my own brand, <a href=""http://www.winstan-t.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Winstan-T</a>. At Winstan-T, our mission is to
leave footprints around the world. Our ultimate vision is to provide a fun and
creative platform to improve people’s lifestyle. I created Winstan-T with these
values in mind: to have fun, to spread kindness and to trigger creativity. With
Winstan-T, I will be able to design and create many more incredible products
that can help change the life of people all over the world.</p>
<p>In the 29 years of my life, I am constantly faced with
challenges and I have been constantly overcoming them. It is through these obstacles that make
my dream of DVa 2 stronger.</p><p><b>DVa2 Come out.................</b></p><p>The idea of DVa first began in the year 2008. During my
college days, I was tasked with a project to create an item with multi-functionality.
Back then, I thought about the possibility of combining the concept of sandals
and sneakers as one. However, my school closed down the class and I never did
started on developing the idea of DVa. For 6 years, DVa was cast aside. It was until
a time where I accidentally stumbled across a multi-purpose shoe featured
online in 2014 that made me remember DVa. I realized that if you were to
hesitate on the things you want to do, there would be others who will jump at
the chance of acting on your ideas and dreams. This comes across as an
awakening moment for me. I made a decision then that I would live out my dream
to the fullest and created Winstan-T. </p>
<p>Over the years, one of the greatest obstacles I faced with
DVa was to produce it. Majority of the manufacturers turned me down when it
comes to production of DVa. The complex design of DVa makes production
difficult. The remaining few manufacturers that were willing to help, either
quoted a hefty price or demanded DVa to be produced at a large quantity. By
holding on and not abandoning my dream, I eventually found a willing partner
that helped produced DVa. DVa is finally born! However, I have to commit to a
certain amount of orders so as to keep DVa alive. In 2014, my crowd funding
campaign failed, but I believe in my DVa dream, which then leads me to create
DVa 2 this year.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">                                                       </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">               </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> I </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">know I am capable of achieving much more.

further and create more astonishing designs under my own brand, </span><a href=""http://www.winstan-t.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Winstan-T</a><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. Now,
with indiegogo, you will be able to play a part in helping me raise funds.
These funds are like the fuel needed for a car to keep on going. As Barack
Obama once mentioned, “The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do

Be Creative! Foster Kindness!Dreamers are people with dreams… I believe that everyone has
a dream that they want to achieve. A special dream that they want to change
into reality. Some dream to fly freely into the sky with no worries at all. Some
dream to travel to all parts of the world. Some dreams are as simple as
bringing happiness to the people around them. Likewise, I am a dreamer too. My
dream combines these dreams; my dream is to be free, to travel, and to bring
happiness to others. I dream to be able to be free and without restrictions, to
travel to all parts of the world, and to bring happiness wherever I go. My
dream is DVa 2.
 What exactly is DVa 2?


DVa 2 is a 2 in 1 shoe designed to suit males of all ages. In
a blink of an eye, you can transform a classy pair of shoes into a fashionable
pair of sandals. Do you find yourselves going through the hassle, visiting shop
after shop to look for a good-looking pair of shoes to suit your fashion style?
DVa 2 is perfect for formal to semi-formal to even causal wear! DVa 2 is what
you are looking for to match every occasion.
You are free to create your very own shoe, with DVa 2. Be it
dressing up for formal events or dressing down for an informal outing with
friends, DVa 2 matches every occasion! Everyone can afford to own a pair of DVa
2. By purchasing a pair of DVa 2, you automatically gain 2 pairs instead of 1!
DVa 2 will not be limited by the boundaries created by
countries. DVa 2 will be able to reach every part of the world and will be made
available to everyone. With DVa 2, you will never have to worry if your attire
matches your shoes. You can simply make your shoes match what you are wearing, every
single day. 
Who Am I....I am Winston Tan, the creator of DVa 2. I aim to be a full-fledged
designer that features my own brand, Winstan-T. At Winstan-T, our mission is to
leave footprints around the world. Our ultimate vision is to provide a fun and
creative platform to improve people’s lifestyle. I created Winstan-T with these
values in mind: to have fun, to spread kindness and to trigger creativity. With
Winstan-T, I will be able to design and create many more incredible products
that can help change the life of people all over the world.
In the 29 years of my life, I am constantly faced with
challenges and I have been constantly overcoming them. It is through these obstacles that make
my dream of DVa 2 stronger.DVa2 Come out.................The idea of DVa first began in the year 2008. During my
college days, I was tasked with a project to create an item with multi-functionality.
Back then, I thought about the possibility of combining the concept of sandals
and sneakers as one. However, my school closed down the class and I never did
started on developing the idea of DVa. For 6 years, DVa was cast aside. It was until
a time where I accidentally stumbled across a multi-purpose shoe featured
online in 2014 that made me remember DVa. I realized that if you were to
hesitate on the things you want to do, there would be others who will jump at
the chance of acting on your ideas and dreams. This comes across as an
awakening moment for me. I made a decision then that I would live out my dream
to the fullest and created Winstan-T. 
Over the years, one of the greatest obstacles I faced with
DVa was to produce it. Majority of the manufacturers turned me down when it
comes to production of DVa. The complex design of DVa makes production
difficult. The remaining few manufacturers that were willing to help, either
quoted a hefty price or demanded DVa to be produced at a large quantity. By
holding on and not abandoning my dream, I eventually found a willing partner
that helped produced DVa. DVa is finally born! However, I have to commit to a
certain amount of orders so as to keep DVa alive. In 2014, my crowd funding
campaign failed, but I believe in my DVa dream, which then leads me to create
DVa 2 this year.                                                                       I know I am capable of achieving much more. I can bring DVa 2
further and create more astonishing designs under my own brand, Winstan-T. Now,
with indiegogo, you will be able to play a part in helping me raise funds.
These funds are like the fuel needed for a car to keep on going. As Barack
Obama once mentioned, “The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do
something. Don’t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make
some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill
yourself with hope.” You can do your part to make good things happen too.
                     Lend me your helping hand to help me to fulfill my  dream

The Smartshoe also knows when you're walking on flat ground versus an incline or if you're climbing up stairs versus walking down. It then calculates calories burned accordingly.
      Did you know that most joints injuries come from a bad cushioning? By constantly analyzing the Smartshoe's cushions, the app alerts you as your cushioning deteriorates because of use. When reaching the 35% cushion safety level, the Smartshoe will warn you and give you specific recommendations for new inserts.    Inspired by concept cars, we engineered the Smartshoe with a futuristic, sporty, and elegant look. Our design inspiration holds true with the shoes opening. The auto-tightening resembles butterfly doors; the leather/microfiber materials resemble a car's interior; and the shoe body itself resembles the sleek exterior lines of futuristic concept cars.        We invented an auto-lacing system that closes and tightens the shoe at the same time.With a simple click on the app your Smartshoe can open by sliding forward and untightening the lace. If ever you run out of battery while wearing the Smartshoes, you can manually open or close them with a push of the exterior button.      Individually warm each foot to a suggested comfort zone of 86°F - 95°F and a maximum temperature of 113°F.The integrated thermostat allows for smart and auto-regulating heat.
When the shoe reaches its desired temperature, the heating turns off, saving battery life. 
When the Smartshoe's temperature drops below the temperature preset, it begins heating once again to reach your desired comfort settings.
    The Smartshoe incorporates a long life Lithium polymer battery in each shoe that are individually rechargeable.Battery life varies greatly depending on heating:

Heat Off - expect battery life of a couple weeks.

Heat On - expect battery life of 5-8 hours.
 A pair of Smartshoes comes with a dual charging Micro USB cable. The charge time ranges from 1.5 hours using the 'Quick Charge' option  to 3 hours with normal charging.    Check out the details on sizing, design, hardware and more.     It started with Marty, it ended with the smartest shoe ever.    The Digitsole team creates innovative products with the goal of making a change in people’s everyday lives.

<p>A)  Parts Replacement: if something breaks all you need to do is replace the specific part that is broken like the temples, frames or lenses. There will never be a need to buy a totally new pair.</p>
<p>B)  Configurations- Chose between 3 Nuke Venom Configurations. 1) Venom Basic, 2) Venom Advance and 3) Venom Pro. <strong><em>""Venom Basic""</em></strong> is meant for those who has a single eyewear need. <strong><em>""Venom Advance""</em></strong> is meant for those who have multiple needs of eyewear. <strong><em>""Venom Pro""</em></strong> is for couples, families, individuals or teams who have different or same eyewear needs but want it in a single product. As Nuke Venom is fully cross compatible you can switch your looks with any other nuke venom product line any time your feel like it.</p>
<p>C) Add Ons: All Nuke Venom products including safety, lifestyle and sports models have the ability to add an rx clip to cater to those who need prescription eyewear. </p>
<p>D) Upgrades: Side shields and protective inner sponges for our safety line, can be purchased as upgrades when you need them.</p>
<p>E) Upgrade- buy a specific part upgrade whenever you feel like it, or if we release a really cool looking design.</p>
<p>F)  Customise the Venom way: Customisation now comes right to your doorstep. Literally. In this concept you actually build the look you want for each day, based on your own complete freedom of choice for the parts that represent you. For the first time we are not the manufacturers of your eyewear , YOU ARE.</p>
<p>the pros of a single modular system is really massive and it will only get better without ever having to buy a whole new pair again. Its allows us to introduce new technologies or innovations without ever having to burn a hole in your pocket because we just need to work on improving that specific part and not create a whole new pair. We save and you save as well. Nuke Venom creates a whole new world of possibilities for you, your friends,  and even families. This is about the common man's right to freedom.

<p align=""justify"">It took us about 1 year to come up with the most robust modular system and a further 8 months to come up with the actual prototype designs, shapes, colours and moulds of every single item. Throughout this time consuming and expensive process it was a huge financial strain on the company. As big as the project sounds we are a team of 5, and we had to operate this project in a very controlled environment or lose everything we had worked for.  In the last 6 months of the project we stopped releasing any new models and even delayed reordering out of stock items, so that we could dedicate any available financial resources to this project. We are glad we took this step to make this project a reality, so that the world could enjoy the first eyewear sunglass modular system that actually works at so many different levels. The journey was though but it was well worth it. We are very close to completion.</p>

<br/><p align=""justify""><strong style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><em>Moulds</em></strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">For the first release of our nuke venom line up, it required the building of completely new moulds ground up- a whopping total of 9 of them. Because venom is unlike anything that is available on the market, everything from the frames, temples, right up to the cases had to be built from scratch with new moulds. The level of precision engineering involved in our moulds made this even tougher(took us a total of 6 months to get all the moulds in perfect condition and measurements). Anyone who has manufacturing experience knows this is the toughest, most time consuming and most expensive part of the project besides the entire research and development phase. The great news is this portion has been done. For a small company like us this was a massive undertaking. </p>
<p align=""justify""> </p>
<p align=""justify""><strong><em>Indiegogoians here is were we need your help</em></strong></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong><em>We want to be more of a crowd-driven eyewear company than a product driven or investor driven company. With NUKE, PEOPLE decide what they want their eyewear to be. The faster we hit our goal the faster we can begin production which would be approximately 30 days.</em></strong></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong><em></em></strong> </p>
<p align=""justify"">The manufacturing of each part requires a higher  than normal minimum order quantity, so that the price remains competitive and low in accordance to the more expensive<span>  high level of imported grade materials we require to manufacture each venom part.  The current funds we have are not sufficient to produce venom at the level we require and we are looking at raising an additional 15,000 USD which will enable us to start manufacturing nuke venom immediately, with the best possible materials and start delivering it around 15 days after the campaign ends. This is a revolutionary concept and very much hope to bring this into reality. You can help make this project a reality by being an early backer of this project only on indiegogo. You can select some really awesome perks, that allows you to get Nuke Venom at a real bargain before it is officially launched.

The Lens Construction



The Pros Of a single modular system for eyewear
A)  Parts Replacement: if something breaks all you need to do is replace the specific part that is broken like the temples, frames or lenses. There will never be a need to buy a totally new pair.
B)  Configurations- Chose between 3 Nuke Venom Configurations. 1) Venom Basic, 2) Venom Advance and 3) Venom Pro. ""Venom Basic"" is meant for those who has a single eyewear need. ""Venom Advance"" is meant for those who have multiple needs of eyewear. ""Venom Pro"" is for couples, families, individuals or teams who have different or same eyewear needs but want it in a single product. As Nuke Venom is fully cross compatible you can switch your looks with any other nuke venom product line any time your feel like it.
C) Add Ons: All Nuke Venom products including safety, lifestyle and sports models have the ability to add an rx clip to cater to those who need prescription eyewear. 
D) Upgrades: Side shields and protective inner sponges for our safety line, can be purchased as upgrades when you need them.
E) Upgrade- buy a specific part upgrade whenever you feel like it, or if we release a really cool looking design.
F)  Customise the Venom way: Customisation now comes right to your doorstep. Literally. In this concept you actually build the look you want for each day, based on your own complete freedom of choice for the parts that represent you. For the first time we are not the manufacturers of your eyewear , YOU ARE.
the pros of a single modular system is really massive and it will only get better without ever having to buy a whole new pair again. Its allows us to introduce new technologies or innovations without ever having to burn a hole in your pocket because we just need to work on improving that specific part and not create a whole new pair. We save and you save as well. Nuke Venom creates a whole new world of possibilities for you, your friends,  and even families. This is about the common man's right to freedom. ""FREEDOM  CHANGES EVERYTHING'
 
Where we are at :Research, Development, design and colours

Prototypes and the last tage before mass production


















It took us about 1 year to come up with the most robust modular system and a further 8 months to come up with the actual prototype designs, shapes, colours and moulds of every single item. Throughout this time consuming and expensive process it was a huge financial strain on the company. As big as the project sounds we are a team of 5, and we had to operate this project in a very controlled environment or lose everything we had worked for.  In the last 6 months of the project we stopped releasing any new models and even delayed reordering out of stock items, so that we could dedicate any available financial resources to this project. We are glad we took this step to make this project a reality, so that the world could enjoy the first eyewear sunglass modular system that actually works at so many different levels. The journey was though but it was well worth it. We are very close to completion.



Protection- Patent
The venom system is a patent pending system.


Moulds
For the first release of our nuke venom line up, it required the building of completely new moulds ground up- a whopping total of 9 of them. Because venom is unlike anything that is available on the market, everything from the frames, temples, right up to the cases had to be built from scratch with new moulds. The level of precision engineering involved in our moulds made this even tougher(took us a total of 6 months to get all the moulds in perfect condition and measurements). Anyone who has manufacturing experience knows this is the toughest, most time consuming and most expensive part of the project besides the entire research and development phase. The great news is this portion has been done. For a small company like us this was a massive undertaking. 
 
Indiegogoians here is were we need your help
We want to be more of a crowd-driven eyewear company than a product driven or investor driven company. With NUKE, PEOPLE decide what they want their eyewear to be. The faster we hit our goal the faster we can begin production which would be approximately 30 days.
 
The manufacturing of each part requires a higher  than normal minimum order quantity, so that the price remains competitive and low in accordance to the more expensive  high level of imported grade materials we require to manufacture each venom part.  The current funds we have are not sufficient to produce venom at the level we require and we are looking at raising an additional 15,000 USD which will enable us to start manufacturing nuke venom immediately, with the best possible materials and start delivering it around 15 days after the campaign ends. This is a revolutionary concept and very much hope to bring this into reality. You can help make this project a reality by being an early backer of this project only on indiegogo. You can select some really awesome perks, that allows you to get Nuke Venom at a real bargain before it is officially launched. This is to thank all those who have supported us since day one.
 

Track-Record
We have been in business for about 1 yr 9 months, The manufacturer selected for  this project have worked with us from day one. . People have trusted nuke to make quality products. The only difference this time is we wanted to make not only a good product but a great product. A product that could change an industry and give freedom back to our consumers. It’s a massive undertaking for a small very young company.

What is Free Maple Movement?
The name represents Canada - not only where our collaborative design team lives and creates - “Maple” is recognized as the symbol of Canada and has come to achieve connotations of
freedom, unity and peace. ""Movement"" is what happens when people come together around great ideas to make great things happen in the world!
Beyond clothing, we are proud to stand up for a new community power within which we are mindful during every consuming experience. We have the ultimate power to decide what is sold based on what
we buy, and if we invest into these business practices in
our respective communities, we will be part of leveraging consumption into a more balanced place. We can THRIVE together. Co-Create for a Healthy Green Planet

<strong>Easier to talk:</strong> minimal chin shape means the mask doesn't pull as you talk.</li>
<li>
<strong>Adjustable fit:</strong> slide toggles easily change the size of the mask to fit well.</li>

Over the past 7 months, we have worked to refine our design based on feedback. We have now created what we believe to be the best version of our mask to date. The newly (re)designed Comfort Mask is made of ultra comfortable Ponte de Roma (66% Rayon / 30% Nylon / 4% Spandex) double knit fabric.  The masks has two layers, connected at the chin. It attaches behind the ears with two adjustable-length ear loops. The Comfort Mask comes in nautical navy. This mask is soft and stretches to conform better to your face.The design concept is a folded shape that gives ample breathing room and contours tightly to your nose to help minimize fogging with glasses. All day comfortThe Comfort Mask was designed to provide comfort and protection to those who are wearing masks just for a quick trip to the grocery store as well as our essential workers who are masked 8+ hours per day. The double layer fabric helps keep out pesky allergens, airborne contaminants and unwanted germs. The Comfort Mask is free of elastic straps that could pull your hair and those painful metal nose guards. This mask sits easily on the ears and spreads out tension evenly. It also is made from a material that makes talking less of a challenge.Imagine that feeling you get when you put on a cozy pair of sweatpants? We designed this product to give you that same feeling of comfort and safety when you wear our mask. Why You Will Love The Comfort Mask:

Easy on the ears: distributed pressure eliminates any pain on the back of the ears.

Easy on the nose: the folded shape allows the mask to avoid squishing your nose.

Folded to fit your nose: no air gap means greatly reduced fogging on eyeglasses.

Easier to talk: minimal chin shape means the mask doesn't pull as you talk.

Adjustable fit: slide toggles easily change the size of the mask to fit well.
The Comfort Mask is meant to fit faces of most shapes and sizes. Avoid mask fatigue by choosing a mask that is not bothersome to wear. The Final Product The Comfort Mask is a two-layer design cut from one piece of fabric, folded in half, connected at the chin. The Comfort Mask is pre-shrunk to prevent shrinking in the wash. The adjustable toggles allow the mask to accommodate a much larger range of head sizes and the ear loops are gentle on the ears. Finally, our disposable filter has been redesigned to be attached securely with ease and doesn’t protrude at the corners. Zootility’s mission is to design, launch, and manufacture exciting, functional, everyday products. We are a team of 12 people, with 13 laser systems, and a 10,000 sf design & manufacturing studio in Portland, Maine, USA.The question we want to answer is: why has so much of our manufacturing left the country? We think there is a better way. We believe we can reimagine everyday items so that we can be self sufficient. Using lasers, quality materials, and designs that inspire, we are committed to products that will last a lifetime and support keeping jobs and technology in our local community.We started with a credit card sized multitool called PocketMonkey, and through eight years of hard work, now have a workshop with over a dozen lasers.We are continuously pushing the limits of what we are capable of, to come up with minimalist designs that can be made from lasers and we can be proud of. We use quality materials and keep all of our products Made In USA.Support our journey, back our project today.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>For several years, right around spring, I’d been searching for a versatile, stylish and comfortable shoe that went with most of my warm weather wardrobe staples of sun dresses, denim, and capris.  Then, last spring, I reached a tipping point:  I realized that my casual, seasonal search was not going to be enough if I was ever going to find that shoe.  With dogged determination, I began an exhaustive search that included visiting every conceivable store and boutique in my area, not to mention an online search that, when all was said and done, included hundreds of sites.</p>
<p>I still came up empty-handed.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, spring had ended and we were days away from a family trip to Lake Como.  Disappointed at not having found what I was looking for, I made do with what I had and ended up packing way too many shoes.  Some were sandals, the stilettos of which did not survive the uneven cobblestones (and I ended up mercilessly shredding the heels).  The others were flats which were comfortable for exploring the lakeside towns on foot, but inappropriate for wearing to brunch or dinner.</p>
<p>At Lake Como, I was inspired by its limpid, emerald-colored water, the sherbet-colored lakeside homes, and its laid-back but glamorous vibe.   Then, one evening, as I fed vanilla ice cream to my younger son, Bryan, I struck up a conversation with a woman with whom I had been sharing the park bench.</p>
<p>I learned that her name was Valentina and she was born in that village nearly eighty years before.  She was the most stylish woman I had encountered in the three years that we had been living in Europe.  Our conversation was brief, but Valentina made a lasting impression on me.  It was through her that I understood that elegance is possible for every woman at every stage of her life and, when done right, a woman feels empowered, not encumbered.</p>
<p>When we returned home, I realized that this elusive shoe would never appear in my closet unless I did something about it.  So, I decided to design it myself.  The “Valentina,” my first design, is the result of my inspiring experiences on that fateful trip.</p>
<p>Donna Laria, my brand, evolved similarly.  The Ancient Romans referred to what is now Lake Como as Larius.  Donna means woman or lady, in Italian.  Hence, <i>Donna Laria</i>, or Lady of the Lake.  Donna Laria is my muse.  She represents an attitude; the spirit of every woman who, in her daily life and with all of its demands, seeks to express her unique beauty elegantly, confidently, and effortlessly.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>My name is Margaret.  </p>
<p>In my life, I’ve worn lots of hats and <i>lots<strong> </strong></i>of shoes.  I believe that women should feel beautiful and confident all the time, but especially in the shoes that take them through each moment of their busy and demanding lives.</p>
<p>I also believe that style or comfort don’t need to be compromised one for the other.</p>
<p>Women can have both!</p>
<p>I’ve visited and lived in lots of places around the world and I’m currently living in Germany where my husband, Kelly, a former fighter pilot in the US Navy, is serving.  We live here with our two boys, Robert and Bryan, and our old Weimaraner, Finnegan.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shoe manufacturers need a minimum purchase amount to start mass producing shoes.  By pre-purchasing your shoes on this campaign, you contribute to the capital we need to place an order with the manufacturer.</li>
<li>Supporters of this campaign will get their choice of high- or low-heel Valentinas just as soon as we can get them to the US.</li>
<li>When you select a perk, we do ask for your preferred heel height and size to assist in our production estimates for our manufacturer.  We will verify your specific shoe size and choice of heel before we ship anything to you.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have been working on the shoe design for almost a year and have tested two prototypes.  We are now in consultations with the manufacturer for a third prototype to finalize details.  Once our standards for quality, beauty, and comfort are met, we will be ready to go to mass production.</p>
<p>If the third prototype does not meet our standards, we will continue to work with the manufacturer to refine their processes until we are confident that the shoes going to our supporters meet our specifications.  We will keep you informed at every step on the way.</p>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>Returns &amp; Exchanges</h3>
<p>All purchases must be returned in their original condition within 30 days for a full refund or exchange.  Shoes cannot be returned if they show ANY signs of wear.  When trying the shoes, do NOT wear them on any surface other than carpet.  The shoes must be returned, undamaged, in the original box.  Do not ship the shoe box without the protection of an additional box.  Missing or damaged boxes will be subject to a 20% restocking fee.</p>
<p>For exchanges: please indicate the desired model/size.  We recommend you contact customer service to place your exchange on hold so it does not sell out while we await your package. Please call or send an e-mail with the order number, the item, and size you would like on hold.</p>
<p>If you receive an item that is damaged or defective, please contact us within 30 days of shipment.  After 30 days, we will attempt to assist with repairs and/or obtaining replacement hardware but may be unable to provide a replacement or refund for an irreparable product.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong>  We are a small company with limited resources.  The above standards are indicative of how we would prioritize our resources in ensuring each contributor is satisfied.  If you are not satisfied, let us know and we will work with you to figure out a solution.</p>
<p> </p>

When we returned home, I realized that this elusive shoe would never appear in my closet unless I did something about it.  So, I decided to design it myself.  The “Valentina,” my first design, is the result of my inspiring experiences on that fateful trip.
Donna Laria, my brand, evolved similarly.  The Ancient Romans referred to what is now Lake Como as Larius.  Donna means woman or lady, in Italian.  Hence, Donna Laria, or Lady of the Lake.  Donna Laria is my muse.  She represents an attitude; the spirit of every woman who, in her daily life and with all of its demands, seeks to express her unique beauty elegantly, confidently, and effortlessly.
 
More About the Valentina

Features:

3.25"" and 1.75"" heel height
Sexy wedge style heel

Secure H-shaped upper

Available in whole sizes only for the time being.  With enough support from this campaign, we may be able to offer half sizes and wide options soon.
 

Meet The Designer

My name is Margaret.  
In my life, I’ve worn lots of hats and lots of shoes.  I believe that women should feel beautiful and confident all the time, but especially in the shoes that take them through each moment of their busy and demanding lives.
I also believe that style or comfort don’t need to be compromised one for the other.
Women can have both!
I’ve visited and lived in lots of places around the world and I’m currently living in Germany where my husband, Kelly, a former fighter pilot in the US Navy, is serving.  We live here with our two boys, Robert and Bryan, and our old Weimaraner, Finnegan.
 
What We Need & What You Get

Shoe manufacturers need a minimum purchase amount to start mass producing shoes.  By pre-purchasing your shoes on this campaign, you contribute to the capital we need to place an order with the manufacturer.
Supporters of this campaign will get their choice of high- or low-heel Valentinas just as soon as we can get them to the US.
When you select a perk, we do ask for your preferred heel height and size to assist in our production estimates for our manufacturer.  We will verify your specific shoe size and choice of heel before we ship anything to you.

 
Risks & Challenges
We have been working on the shoe design for almost a year and have tested two prototypes.  We are now in consultations with the manufacturer for a third prototype to finalize details.  Once our standards for quality, beauty, and comfort are met, we will be ready to go to mass production.
If the third prototype does not meet our standards, we will continue to work with the manufacturer to refine their processes until we are confident that the shoes going to our supporters meet our specifications.  We will keep you informed at every step on the way.
 

Returns & Exchanges
All purchases must be returned in their original condition within 30 days for a full refund or exchange.  Shoes cannot be returned if they show ANY signs of wear.  When trying the shoes, do NOT wear them on any surface other than carpet.  The shoes must be returned, undamaged, in the original box.  Do not ship the shoe box without the protection of an additional box.  Missing or damaged boxes will be subject to a 20% restocking fee.
For exchanges: please indicate the desired model/size.  We recommend you contact customer service to place your exchange on hold so it does not sell out while we await your package. Please call or send an e-mail with the order number, the item, and size you would like on hold.
If you receive an item that is damaged or defective, please contact us within 30 days of shipment.  After 30 days, we will attempt to assist with repairs and/or obtaining replacement hardware but may be unable to provide a replacement or refund for an irreparable product.
Bottom line:  We are a small company with limited resources.  The above standards are indicative of how we would prioritize our resources in ensuring each contributor is satisfied.  If you are not satisfied, let us know and we will work with you to figure out a solution.

<h2>Vision:</h2>
<p>Since getting married 2 years ago I've realized there are a lot of rings that just don't last. The materials that are most commonly used in a wedding band don't really lend themselves to an active lifestyle.  The biggest problem I have with my ring is that I am constantly scratching it up against different surfaces.  Over time this has turned my ring into a worn/scratched mess.</p>
<p>I wanted a ring that I could enjoy wearing without having to worry about the constant scratching and scuffing that come from an active lifestyle.  After going through multiple rings that weren't working, I decided to produce my own.</p>
<p>Material:</p>
<p>We started looking into the various materials that are used in rings when we happened upon pressure forged ceramic.  We wanted to make the ring out of the most scratch resistant material we could find. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484609411/jnqmt6gdl8n50nvppujt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We looked into the current aerospace research and found that the actual blades used in jet engines are made out of this same material, these blades need to be made out of something that won’t scratch or scuff over time, to stay aerodynamic over the lifetime of the jet engine…we decided to take that same material and put it into our ring. </p>
<h2>Design:</h2>
<p>We started with a rendering of the basic shape and design we wanted to use for the rings. We settled on a basic band that's rounded on the outside and on the edges. The roundness makes the ring comfortable to wear and gives each one a sleek look.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484609438/bizyhhz7m39n34bilnah.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>We wanted to use the world around us to inspire us for the design, and we loved the concept of light… There are so many naturally occurring sources of light in nature that we wanted to capture the raw essence of that light and incorporate that into our design.  </p>

<p>We settled on a design that we absolutely love, and we have received AMAZING feedback from everyone who has seen it.  The ring is a domed, pressure-forged ceramic band that comes in both black and white.  The inner glow is made up of a non-toxic blend of strontium alluminate...the same material you may be used to seeing in higher end swiss watches.  </p>
<p>The glow is rechargeable and lasts a lifetime.</p>

<h3>LIFETIME WARRANTY</h3>
<p>All Myssy garments are handmade in Finland of a high quality yarn and we are proud of our work. We give all our products a lifetime warranty. If this product ever breaks down, we will ﬁx it or replace it with a new one. Simply mail the product back to the farm with a Warranty Repair Form which can be downloaded from this page. However, Myssyfarmi is not responsible for direct, incidental or consequential damages for any reason.</p>
<p>Please note, that the two following occasions are not covered by the warranty: stretching and felting. The myssy product stretches to match your head/body, which is one the attributes of the wool we use. If you want that the product takes more of its original shape, wash it carefully following the instructions and shape it while it’s still wet. Also if your myssy product becomes felted due to the hard rubbing or improper use, it is not covered by the warranty.</p>
<p>Your Myssy product will serve you long! </p>

<h3>GOOD TO KNOW</h3>
<p>1. We offer free shipping to all products worldwide!</p>
<p>2. After you have funded, we will send you an order survey where you can choose the colours and the sizes of your products. </p>
<p>3. Myssy Luksus, Muffi, Collar and Tube come in one standard size, but in Farmesters you can choose from S, M &amp; L. Size M is bought by 90% of our customers, but if you like it more tight or loose, S or L are good for that. </p>
<p>4. Our myssys are all unique and  though the grannies have this same chart, not all myssys size M are precisely the same.  </p>

<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>With your help, the local grannies get to do meaningful work, build a strong social network and of course – laugh and have fun. The grannies get a compensation for each myssy they knit, but this is not the essence of it. It’s about empowering our local communities and making sure everyone gets to be a part of it. The grannies are central to our work, but the positive impact extends to local producers, inhabitants and other local actors. We hope to grow in order to being able to get more grannies and local producers involved, and share the message of empowering the local communities around the globe.</p>

<h3>RISKS</h3>
<p>We are working with nature, the hands of people as our engine. All our myssy products are of high-quality organic wool, hand-knitted in their final form. In case of extremely high demand we might face a challenge in delivering all the products in time. We are used to responding to fluctuating demands as our growth has brought them about, and will not leave anyone disappointed to our Myssy product. Our promise is to deliver the products the latest before the snow falls in Finland in December. By pledging you acknowledge this risk of delayed delivery.</p>

The grannies get a compensation for each myssy they knit, but this is not the essence of it. It’s about empowering our local communities and making sure everyone gets to be a part of it. The grannies are central to our work, but the positive impact extends to local producers, inhabitants and other local actors. We hope to grow in order to being able to get more grannies and local producers involved, and share the message of empowering the local communities around the globe.


 
RISKS
We are working with nature, the hands of people as our engine. All our myssy products are of high-quality organic wool, hand-knitted in their final form. In case of extremely high demand we might face a challenge in delivering all the products in time. We are used to responding to fluctuating demands as our growth has brought them about, and will not leave anyone disappointed to our Myssy product. Our promise is to deliver the products the latest before the snow falls in Finland in December. By pledging you acknowledge this risk of delayed delivery.

These always have, and always will continue to influence the style and form of our frames.For our newest glasses and sunglasses collection - The Studio, we were influenced by the originality of the Bridge of Aspiration at The Royal Ballet School in London.   The Studio Collection will be handcrafted by artisans in the small Japanese town of Sabae; a historic community with a mastery of eyewear production.  These master-craftsmen were the first in the world to incorporate the high-grade Titanium used in aerospace technology into eyewear. Their process combines the traditional art of frame-making with modern technology to produce exceptional quality glasses and sunglasses.  We've decided to produce our collection from the high-grade Japanese Titanium used in aerospace technology as it has the highest strength-to-weight ratio of any metal. This also means our Studio frames only weigh 12.05 grams. Benefits of Titanium: We’ve joined forces with the international charity Sightsavers to offer one sight-saving cataract surgery for every ten pairs of glasses or sunglasses that we sell - so that we can do our part to help reduce global blindness. The reason we're able to use the same Japanese master-craftsmen as the niche luxury eyewear labels but not charge extortionate prices is that we're coming to you on Indiegogo. We don't have to excessively spend on marketing costs, we don't have any retail stores, and we don't pay for celebrity endorsements. This means we can afford to offer eyewear of the same quality as the niche luxury labels, but for a fraction of the price.   Prescription Lenses:Lens CoatingsAll of our prescription lenses include a 3 in 1 premium lens coating.  Sunglass & Blue-Light Computer Lenses: Lens Upgrade Options: Our Studio frames come with exceptional quality 1.61 lenses for no extra cost. However, if you would like to upgrade these, we have a range of options such as ultra-thin 1.67 and 1.74 index lenses or entry-level and Transitions photochromic lenses.To upgrade your lenses, you will be able to purchase an add-on in a survey sent to you 10 days after the payment is processed.  We offer sun lenses in black, blue or brown. They are made from nylon, a top-notch performance material with amazing shock resistance whilst being extremely lightweight.We're so confident about the strength and durability of our frame hinges that we decided to put them to the test. Watch below to see what happened. We designed the temples of our Studio frames to be slightly tapered. This means they offer extra flexibility and are therefore suited to all head shapes.

<h3>ABOUT BERMUDA BORN</h3>
<p>My name is Patrice Morgan and I am the designer and sole creator of Bermuda Born. Bermuda Born is an independent, luxury accessories and gifts brand that was founded in my island home of Bermuda.</p>
<p>As a graduate of London College of Fashion, I am ready to use my knowledge of making highly skilled accessories, to bring you premium products that feel good to the touch and are made by the finest craftsmen out there.</p>
<p>I created Bermuda Born because I am really passionate about providing products that will survive for generation after generation.  </p>
<p>I am concerned with the environmental impact of “fast fashion"". Fast fashion is the result of consumers demanding trend-driven, cheaply made products. However, this has created a disposable culture, which has resulted in global environmental issues in the form of not only clothing landfills, but the human factor.</p>
<p>My vision is to switch the fashion game around by changing the way consumers view quantity over quality. I want consumers to realize that fashion can be something special that’s worth investing in, whilst still remaining affordable. My aim is to create products, which are not only nostalgic, but will stand the test of time.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The biggest hurdle we face is to raise enough funds to market Bermuda Born in major cities around the world. With your support, we can take a giant step closer to our goals. All the money raised for Bermuda Born will go towards:</p>
<p>• Expediting the business development process which would contribute to the running of our business in a more timely fashion and would enable us to become an efficient global business trader.</p>
<p>• The cost of producing our first staple handbag collection (design, prototyping, materials, S&amp;H).</p>
<p>• Various other start-up costs such as website development and international/local marketing initiatives.</p>
<p><em>Although the minimum amount of money we are expecting to raise is $20,000 we are hoping to surpass this amount.</em></p>
<h3>WHAT YOU'LL RECEIVE FOR FUNDING US</h3>
<p>Please support us by purchasing one of our Bermuda Born products, or by purchasing a Bermuda Born experience. We are offering the following:</p>

<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We live in an age where products are no longer created to be keepsakes. Instead, they are made with cheap materials and are then thrown away quickly. We want to bring back products that last and have a personal connection with the owner and we want to sell gifts that are nostalgic - gifts that really mean something. Our aim is to bring back fine leather goods and gifts at a price you can afford. </p>
</div>

As a graduate of London College of Fashion, I am ready to use my knowledge of making highly skilled accessories, to bring you premium products that feel good to the touch and are made by the finest craftsmen out there.
I created Bermuda Born because I am really passionate about providing products that will survive for generation after generation.  
I am concerned with the environmental impact of “fast fashion"". Fast fashion is the result of consumers demanding trend-driven, cheaply made products. However, this has created a disposable culture, which has resulted in global environmental issues in the form of not only clothing landfills, but the human factor.
My vision is to switch the fashion game around by changing the way consumers view quantity over quality. I want consumers to realize that fashion can be something special that’s worth investing in, whilst still remaining affordable. My aim is to create products, which are not only nostalgic, but will stand the test of time.
WHAT WE NEED


The biggest hurdle we face is to raise enough funds to market Bermuda Born in major cities around the world. With your support, we can take a giant step closer to our goals. All the money raised for Bermuda Born will go towards:
• Expediting the business development process which would contribute to the running of our business in a more timely fashion and would enable us to become an efficient global business trader.
• The cost of producing our first staple handbag collection (design, prototyping, materials, S&H).
• Various other start-up costs such as website development and international/local marketing initiatives.
Although the minimum amount of money we are expecting to raise is $20,000 we are hoping to surpass this amount.
WHAT YOU'LL RECEIVE FOR FUNDING US
Please support us by purchasing one of our Bermuda Born products, or by purchasing a Bermuda Born experience. We are offering the following:

THE IMPACT


We live in an age where products are no longer created to be keepsakes. Instead, they are made with cheap materials and are then thrown away quickly. We want to bring back products that last and have a personal connection with the owner and we want to sell gifts that are nostalgic - gifts that really mean something. Our aim is to bring back fine leather goods and gifts at a price you can afford.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Projects of this nature typically carry a high amount of risk, which is precisely why we assembled the core team, </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">the way we did. We understand that a project of this scale will require expert project and risk management </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">guidance to make it to the production line; we are well prepared for the journey ahead.</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">And it is going to be a journey. We are using specialised funding techniques and embracing all aspects of social <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">and digital technologies to make this happen – building on the experience of Willie and Adrian, our headline </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">personalities who lend an enormous amount of enthusiasm and creative energy to this project.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Finally, the very nature of this concept lends itself well to attracting big-name sponsors and collaborators; <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">we already have a growing number of supporters and are confident that we can execute this project given the </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">expressions of interest we are receiving.</span></p>
<h3>
<b style=""text-align: justify; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">FAQ</b><br/>
</h3></span><p></p>
<h4>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">How are the Funds Being Used?</b><br/>
</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Acquired funds will be used for the production costs of the show. The funds will cover expenses involved in filming a professional production.</p>
<p>Here's a budget breakdown:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Cameras, lighting and other equipment costs</li>
<li>Producer's cost for filming and editing the show</li>
<li>Project coordination, oversight and monitoring</li>
<li>Booking expenses for locations and venues</li>
<li>Stylist / wardrobe and related expenses </li>
<li>Booking and administrative expenses for models</li>
<li>Travel expenses for crew, contestants and cast</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As with any production project, our campaign can be scaled. If we exceed our funding goal, we will have the flexibility to make this first series the most valuable experience for our contestants and supporters, as well as our audience. Any additional funds would increase our ability to expand the concept and secure talented guest stars and, most importantly our ability to create an amazing reality show production!</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<h4><b>Is crowdfunding your only source of funding?</b></h4>
<p>No, we will have other contingent sources of funding, commercial and private.</p>
<h4><b>What happens to my money if you don't reach your goal?</b></h4>If we cannot film the show due to lack of funding, you will be refunded in full.<br/></span><p></p>
<h4><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Thank You!</span></h4>

Risks & Challenges
Projects of this nature typically carry a high amount of risk, which is precisely why we assembled the core team, the way we did. We understand that a project of this scale will require expert project and risk management guidance to make it to the production line; we are well prepared for the journey ahead.


And it is going to be a journey. We are using specialised funding techniques and embracing all aspects of social and digital technologies to make this happen – building on the experience of Willie and Adrian, our headline personalities who lend an enormous amount of enthusiasm and creative energy to this project.
Finally, the very nature of this concept lends itself well to attracting big-name sponsors and collaborators; we already have a growing number of supporters and are confident that we can execute this project given the expressions of interest we are receiving.

FAQ


How are the Funds Being Used?

Acquired funds will be used for the production costs of the show. The funds will cover expenses involved in filming a professional production.
Here's a budget breakdown:


Cameras, lighting and other equipment costs
Producer's cost for filming and editing the show
Project coordination, oversight and monitoring
Booking expenses for locations and venues
Stylist / wardrobe and related expenses 
Booking and administrative expenses for models
Travel expenses for crew, contestants and cast


As with any production project, our campaign can be scaled. If we exceed our funding goal, we will have the flexibility to make this first series the most valuable experience for our contestants and supporters, as well as our audience. Any additional funds would increase our ability to expand the concept and secure talented guest stars and, most importantly our ability to create an amazing reality show production!

Is crowdfunding your only source of funding?
No, we will have other contingent sources of funding, commercial and private.
What happens to my money if you don't reach your goal?If we cannot film the show due to lack of funding, you will be refunded in full.
Thank You!

<p><strong>Liusid</strong></p>
<p>It's funny how life takes you where you were always meant to be, but it never looks like it did in your dreams! My name is Ed Carlise.  I work in the customer service field.  I have been married for 7 years to my beautiful wife Heather and we have a 4 year old son named Kegan.  I am also a Cancer Survivor.</p>
<p>My campaign is to get my company Liusid and my nonprofit The Liusid Foundation funded and up off the ground.  Liusid is an apparel company that will sell quality clothing and reasonable prices with a portion of the proceeds going to The Liusid Foundation.  Once there are funds in The Liusid Foundation they will be distributed to various Cancer charities and patients in need of help.  These two ideas are VERY important to me.  Cancer took the lives of my aunt, uncle and dad all within a 6 year time period.  This disease also altered the lives of my cousin (who has had to battle throat Cancer 4 times and she has kicked it’s ass every time) myself, friends and several co-workers.  I am tired of watching this disease do whatever it wants whenever it wants and I have decided to stand up and FIGHT!</p>
<p>With your contributions, I will not only be able to get my business and nonprofit up off the ground but I will be able to make a stand against this ugly disease and help many affected by it along the way. So I ask you to please, please help me STAND UP and FIGHT!</p>
<p>I am asking for whatever I can get, but my goal is $10,000.  With this money I will be able to complete the process of filling papers such as my LLC, 5013c, and any other legal documents that may pop up.  I will also be able to complete the website and finalize the first line of clothing which will include t-shirts, jeans, and hats all of which have been submitted to the artist for final tweaking.  Hopefully with your help I will be able to have Liusid up and running by June 1, 2013.  If there is any money left over from the initial start up costs I will be donating the rest to a Cancer charity to be voted on by you, at <a href=""http://www.liusid.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.liusid.com</a>.</p>
<p>I hope to have sample shirts up on the site within the next two weeks so that people can get a glimpse of what is coming.  Also please stop by the site, it is just a teaser now but should be up and operational by the end of next week as well.  If you have any questions or comments or would like to submit a shirt design my email is <a href=""mailto:carlisefamily@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">carlisefamily@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>I know that right now I am just some stranger to you with a story that you have probably already heard.  My story is different in that I am not just happy with being a Cancer Survivor.  I want to be a Cancer destroyer as well.  I want to know that when I leave this beautiful world in 50 years or so I did every thing in my power to end this disease and I make myself, my family and you as well, proud of what I accomplished.</p>
<p>P.S.  If you don’t want to donate to me that is totally fine but please find some Cancer charity and throw some cash their way, every little bit helps.</p>

<h1><em>The StashBelt:</em></h1>
<p>Handmade in Kenya with 100% natural African leather<strong>, <em>StashBelt</em></strong> is the WORLD'S ONLY traveler's money belt with integrated DATA STORAGE.</p>
<p>Your <em><strong>StashBelt</strong></em> is a wearable insurance policy, designed for intrepid travellers in troubled times. Yet <em><strong>StashBelt</strong></em> is versatile and comfortable enough to be worn every day by anyone. Whether you're stuck in a tough spot in Bangkok or hanging out a coffeeshop in New York City, <strong><em>StashBelt</em></strong> is for you.</p>
<p>It's<strong> HIDDEN 18-Inch Zipper Pocket</strong> is large enough to hide up to $500 in folded bills - enough to get you out of nearly any jam. You can also stash keys, jewelry, medication or any other small, precious items you'd rather keep away from sticky fingers. </p>
<p><strong><em>StashBelt</em></strong> is the only moneybelt with a built-in data storage solution: a hidden <strong>4 GB Micro USB Stick</strong>. Use this to keep scans of key documents like your passport, travel insurance information, ID cards...or a selection of your favourite tunes to rock out to while on the road.</p>
<p>With our double snap design, you can even customize your <strong><em>StashBelt</em></strong> with buckles of your own.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><em>       Travel safe. Travel with confidence. Travel with a StashBelt!</em></strong></h3>

<h1><em>The StashStory</em></h1>
<p>After spending many years living and traveling abroad, the <em><strong>StashBelt</strong></em> team was fed up with common depictions of Africa, full of starving orphans and ""Save Africa"" rhetoric. Having actually spent time there, our experiences showed us Africa the proud, Africa the beautiful and Africa the hopeful.</p>
<p>So why didn't more people know about this side of the African story?</p>
<p>Realizing that only grassoots wealth creation can raise individuals and nations out of the cycle of poverty, <strong><em>StashBelt </em></strong>was formed in 2012 as a collaboration between skilled leather artisans in Kenya and young social entrepreneurs in Canada.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1162.photobucket.com/albums/q521/Stashbelt/Wambua.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1><em>How does Stashbelt work?</em></h1>
<p>Every <em><strong>StashBelt</strong></em> is hand-crafted by some of the top leather workers in Africa. All leather comes from indigenous Boran cows that graze and roam freely throughout the Kenyan countryside.</p>
<div class=""template""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1162.photobucket.com/albums/q521/Stashbelt/kick1a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>While sizing and styles vary, each <strong><em>StashBelt</em></strong> is equipped with a hidden zipper pocket to store important papers (copies of your passport, bank/credit cards, travel insurance, etc.) and emergency money (up to 10 bills can fit folded up).</p>
<div class=""template""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1162.photobucket.com/albums/q521/Stashbelt/kick2a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>All <strong><em>StashBelts</em></strong> are equipped with a small slot for our custom-made <strong>4GB USB</strong> jump drives.</p>
<div class=""template""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1162.photobucket.com/albums/q521/Stashbelt/kick3a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>

<h1><em>How will we use your money?</em></h1>
<p><em>Well first of all, $10,000 goes a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">LONG</span> way in Kenya!</em></p>
<p>As you can see, our Nairobi workshop is a little <span class=""il"">cramped</span> even by local standards. Despite these conditions, the team has been able to turn out incredible products and create exciting new designs every time we speak to them. Our first bit of business is to move to a cleaner and larger location just down the road. Your Indiegogo pledge ensures a stable income for our master leather artisans and young apprentices. Together we're creating jobs and putting food on the tables of a lot of underemployed yet talented Kenyans.</p>
<p>The remaining funds will be directed into tooling up the shop for more sustainable and large-scale production, purchasing organic leather and raw materials (always locally sourced) and finally sorting out a streamlined method of getting our belts from Nairobi to your doorstep!</p>
<p>Your support means we can turn <strong><em>StashBelt</em></strong> into a reality. Help us create sustainable jobs and change lives in Kenya. In exchange you'll score sweet gear making you the coolest traveler around.</p>
<p>Check out this killer messenger bag (only 50 available) that our guys recently completed:</p>

<h1><em>What makes Stashbelt different?</em></h1>
<p>A North-South partnership conceived to leverage the complementary skills of African artisans and North American entrepreneurs, <em><strong>StashBelt</strong></em> pioneers a new model of cooperative development and shared benefit. To us, social enterprise isn't a passing fad; the triple bottom line is real and here to stay.</p>
<p>With this in mind, <strong><em>StashBelt</em></strong> pays above-market wages to our workers, sources only free-range Boran cows for leather hides, provides vocational training and certification for apprentices, and donates a portion of all profits to the <em>StashBelt Foundation.</em></p>
<h1><em>What's the StashBelt Foundation?</em></h1>
<p><strong>The StashBelt Foundation </strong>(SBF) aims to address issues of poverty and development in Kenya through the lens of trade not aid, pride not pity. With our first loan, SBF has helped launch the Kibera Gamer's Cafe, a video game hangout for kids in the largest slum in East Africa. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/I8VaQqj.png?1"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div class=""template"">From the first day, the Kibera Gamer's Cafe has become a hot spot and positive space for youth to hang out after school. Based on its success, plans for expansion into the next shop and more gaming systems are in the works.</div>
<div class=""template""> </div>
<div class=""template"">SBF will continue to support similar creative projects in Kenya that provide long-term employment opportunities and positive spaces for youth.</div>

<h1><em>Sounds amazing but what should I do now?</em></h1>
<p>Please take a look at the rewards we have to offer. While climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro is obviously the coolest, we sincerely hope that you will consider buying a StashBelt as we are a new social enterprise looking to create a new way to do business while doing good in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Feeling generous?</strong> Did you know more than 1/3rd of all Indiegogo donors show their support by donating <em>above and beyond</em> the perk amount? - And you can too!</p>
<p><strong>Feeling frugal? </strong>We still need your help! Support us by spreading the word in any way you can: Like us, Tweet us, Pin us, Post us, let your favorite newspaper/blogger know... and for God's sake somebody please tell Ellen!</p>

Every StashBelt is hand-crafted by some of the top leather workers in Africa. All leather comes from indigenous Boran cows that graze and roam freely throughout the Kenyan countryside.

While sizing and styles vary, each StashBelt is equipped with a hidden zipper pocket to store important papers (copies of your passport, bank/credit cards, travel insurance, etc.) and emergency money (up to 10 bills can fit folded up).

All StashBelts are equipped with a small slot for our custom-made 4GB USB jump drives.


Buckle up and Stashbelt's hidden payload is now safe from prying eyes!


How will we use your money?
Well first of all, $10,000 goes a LONG way in Kenya!
As you can see, our Nairobi workshop is a little cramped even by local standards. Despite these conditions, the team has been able to turn out incredible products and create exciting new designs every time we speak to them. Our first bit of business is to move to a cleaner and larger location just down the road. Your Indiegogo pledge ensures a stable income for our master leather artisans and young apprentices. Together we're creating jobs and putting food on the tables of a lot of underemployed yet talented Kenyans.
The remaining funds will be directed into tooling up the shop for more sustainable and large-scale production, purchasing organic leather and raw materials (always locally sourced) and finally sorting out a streamlined method of getting our belts from Nairobi to your doorstep!
Your support means we can turn StashBelt into a reality. Help us create sustainable jobs and change lives in Kenya. In exchange you'll score sweet gear making you the coolest traveler around.
Check out this killer messenger bag (only 50 available) that our guys recently completed:

What makes Stashbelt different?
A North-South partnership conceived to leverage the complementary skills of African artisans and North American entrepreneurs, StashBelt pioneers a new model of cooperative development and shared benefit. To us, social enterprise isn't a passing fad; the triple bottom line is real and here to stay.
With this in mind, StashBelt pays above-market wages to our workers, sources only free-range Boran cows for leather hides, provides vocational training and certification for apprentices, and donates a portion of all profits to the StashBelt Foundation.
What's the StashBelt Foundation?
The StashBelt Foundation (SBF) aims to address issues of poverty and development in Kenya through the lens of trade not aid, pride not pity. With our first loan, SBF has helped launch the Kibera Gamer's Cafe, a video game hangout for kids in the largest slum in East Africa. 

From the first day, the Kibera Gamer's Cafe has become a hot spot and positive space for youth to hang out after school. Based on its success, plans for expansion into the next shop and more gaming systems are in the works.
 
SBF will continue to support similar creative projects in Kenya that provide long-term employment opportunities and positive spaces for youth.
 

Sounds amazing but what should I do now?
Please take a look at the rewards we have to offer. While climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro is obviously the coolest, we sincerely hope that you will consider buying a StashBelt as we are a new social enterprise looking to create a new way to do business while doing good in the world.
Feeling generous? Did you know more than 1/3rd of all Indiegogo donors show their support by donating above and beyond the perk amount? - And you can too!
Feeling frugal? We still need your help! Support us by spreading the word in any way you can: Like us, Tweet us, Pin us, Post us, let your favorite newspaper/blogger know... and for God's sake somebody please tell Ellen!
Thank you in advance for supporting our project.

These patients and their families are partnered with a participating designer, and they willingly share their stories, their disappointments and their successes with all of us. Every time a member of the Jingle team walks into the pediatric clinic at the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, one is a struck by the artwork on the ceilings and on the walls; the unflappable parent comforting a tired child; the tireless action of the staff; the smiles on all the faces; the courage that each and every child and adult must have to walk through those doors each day.</p>

<p><em><span style=""color: #138cd3;"">I'm raising money to finish development and bring to market a first time new design</span></em><em style=""color: #138cd3;""><span style=""color: #138cd3;"">  </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style=""color: #138cd3;"">I was motivated to create this new design after I saw a picture on the internet of a 4 year old little boy who stuck a huge pair of scissors into his face when he was running and fell with them in his hands.  <br/></span></em></p>
<p><em><span style=""color: #138cd3;"">Just the thought alone of a child being injured by a pair of scissors is more than enough to create needless stress and anxiety.  It only takes a few seconds for a bad accident to happen.  </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style=""color: #138cd3;"">Every parent shares this fear, and for far too many, this fear becomes a reality.  Thousands of children are rushed to hospital emergency room every year because of scissor accident. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style=""color: #138cd3;"">Every child is at risk when using normal pointed scissors.  </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style=""color: #138cd3;"">I think you will agree that one accident is one too many. Together, we can provide a higher level of safety four you children and millions of others.  Please help me bring this product to life by picking a perk listed on the right and then making a donation.  </span></em></p>
<h3><em>Please donate today.  You get great thank you perks in return for your donations; exclusive limited edition T-shirts, caps, first parents to have a set of ""My Pet Scissors,"" more.  You can even give in the name of someone else such as a mother's day gift.</em></h3>

<p><strong>""My Pet Scissors"" is a revolutionary, exciting new design in safety scissors for children.  Together, with your help, we can help protect millions of children from needless tragedies.</strong></p>
<p>This project can only be a success with you help. It won't happen without your support.  Every day lost is another day another child is needlessly hurt.  Every dollar counts.  You can make a difference.</p>

<p><strong><br/></strong></p></div>","Hi everyone.  This project is cancelled and a new one will be started under the name of 'Happy Scissors.""   The my pet scissors name was confusing to a few who though the scissors were for their cat, dog, or pet. 
I'm raising money to finish development and bring to market a first time new design  
I was motivated to create this new design after I saw a picture on the internet of a 4 year old little boy who stuck a huge pair of scissors into his face when he was running and fell with them in his hands.  
Just the thought alone of a child being injured by a pair of scissors is more than enough to create needless stress and anxiety.  It only takes a few seconds for a bad accident to happen.  
Every parent shares this fear, and for far too many, this fear becomes a reality.  Thousands of children are rushed to hospital emergency room every year because of scissor accident. 
Every child is at risk when using normal pointed scissors.  
I think you will agree that one accident is one too many. Together, we can provide a higher level of safety four you children and millions of others.  Please help me bring this product to life by picking a perk listed on the right and then making a donation.  
Please donate today.  You get great thank you perks in return for your donations; exclusive limited edition T-shirts, caps, first parents to have a set of ""My Pet Scissors,"" more.  You can even give in the name of someone else such as a mother's day gift.

""My Pet Scissors"" is a revolutionary, exciting new design in safety scissors for children.  Together, with your help, we can help protect millions of children from needless tragedies.
This project can only be a success with you help. It won't happen without your support.  Every day lost is another day another child is needlessly hurt.  Every dollar counts.  You can make a difference.

Do you want to help make children's lives safer?
Would you feel good knowing that you helped a parent breathe a sigh of relief because their child was not hurt by standard scissors? 
Would you be proud wearing your limited edition ""My Pet Scissors Founding Contributor"" T-shirt and a parent see it and thanks you?
Would you like to be one of the select few to be the first to receive your own pair of limited edition ""My Pet Scissors"" and other limited edition perks?
Will you help me spread the word and also make a ‘contributing founder’ donation today?
Thank You, Kenneth Doyle

DESIGN NOTES:


The pictures of the three My Pet Scissors are concept drawings. 
The mechanics of the scissors is not shown. 
The scissors part itself is just like a standard sewing scissor, except that the cutting blade is lengthened to 75%.  
It is then encased in a circular ring that has room on the side for the Pet images. 
The two different designs seen in the above pictures will be merged together into one single version.

DESIGN DETAILS:


Size - The first versions of My Pet Scissors will be between 4""- 5"" inches in diameter.  The maximum cutting lenght of the blades will be 75% of the diameter.  Kids have show to love the larger of the two sizes.
The handle of a conventional scissor is removed and the blades are encompassed in a circular cage. The sides are printed with cute pet faces.
Each My Pet Scissors Pet comes with its pet pedigree certificate.
To use - simply squeeze the scissors together to cut.  Similar to how open end sewing scissors are used.
Finger cut risk is reduced because the blades automatically return to their original opening width of approximately 1/4"".  .
The circular design eliminates dangerous points. 
The blades are made of metal and the rest is plastic.

Innovative for its time, the Discman revolutionised the whole industry.We wanted to bring the same traditional principles and philosophy into our designs and hence the Disc Wallet was born to hold coins upright whilst still creating something beautiful, slim, packed with features and most importantly minimalist for the new generation.                         Our eureka moment! In a eureka moment and after buying some cardboard paper, stretch bands we created a simple prototype. After searching countlessly we came across a genuine leathermaker business and created the first set of designs that led to multiple field testings, feedback, pivots, iterations, resulting in the highest quality product that solved the problem. INITIAL PROTOTYPE  FINAL DESIGNInitial Pattern Making Leather Cutting Traditional Hand Stitching Premium Leather Handcrafted Disc Wallet    PRODUCT DESCRIPTION   RFID Card Features:Traditional RFID fabrics are only effective for small range frequencies.RFID shield card has been created exclusively for backers which provides the maximum protection and blocking technology to prevent unauthorized access to personal information.Fits easily in the Disc Wallet card slot.Protects following types of contactless cards: All payment cards, Student IDs, Transit cards such as Oyster, ID cards, Access cards operates on frequency 13,56 MHz and Cards such as MIFARE, HID iClass, DESFire.ISO 14443/15693 and EPC Gen1/Gen2 contactless smart card. 100% Full Grain Calf Leather Features:  We work closely with our supplier and only chose the highest quality of 100% Full Grain Calf Leather.Features great durability and strength which can last a lifetime.Entirely organic material.Full-grain leather breathes and ventilates body heat away from the body, allowing them to remain cool and comfortable in summer while not becoming cold and rigid in winter.Natural, supple, and provides a robust hand.All wallets are traditional hand sewn with top quality stitching techniques, we are bringing back this lost art form.  REWARDS     PRODUCTION TIMELINE  We have completed an intensive, 6 month-long prototyping process with consistent stages of testing feedback, iterations to perfect our Disc Wallet as we move into production.The next step is to place the order for materials and start the first production run of wallets.

<h2>CABIN SPACEY - home anywhere</h2>
<h3>A new genre of urban living above the roofs and in every niche of the city. Together we will build a prototype!</h3>
<div> </div>
<p>Over the past 100 years, our urban living situation has changed very little. Whether brownstone or high-rise: The average configuration of two rooms/kitchen/bath remains standard. At the same time, our cities keep growing while affordable space is at a premium, making apartment hunting increasingly stressful. The resulting new urban challenges demand progressive innovations.<br/>It’s not just modern urban nomads – here today, there tomorrow – who need CABIN SPACEY.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464635741/interior_jw6qkn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>CABIN SPACEY offers living space that’s very much now: crafted from sustainable materials and designed to match the actual needs of those looking for a new home. Environmentally friendly, contemporary, intelligent, modular, flexible. No matter where you plan to live: Cabin Spacey exploits previously untapped potential. The minimal homes for new living conquer your city’s upper-most level – its rooftops. Berlin alone has 55,000 unused roofs that are unsuitable for regular development. This is where Cabin Spacey comes in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464636349/night_wall2neu_vfyfir.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The path forward takes us all the way up: CABIN SPACEY exemplifies the growing demand for high-quality, resource efficient, and extremely flexible urban living space. At just over 20 square meters, the smallest unit can easily house 2 people. CABIN SPACEY consists of an outer hull and an interior supply unit featuring a bathroom, bed, and kitchenette. For urban nomads, the minimal house is the perfect choice: It’s easy to transport, easy to install, and easily hooked up to existing utilities and infrastructures, whether unused roof, urban wasteland, or parking lot. With CABIN SPACEY, a confident generation unlocks new oases in the metropolitan jungle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464636921/IMG_3335_t9ifnn.jpg"" src=""""/></b></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>How it works</b></h3>
<p>Many decision-makers are already intrigued by the idea. Negotiations with potential customers are currently under way. Our first prototype is about to see the light of day: CABIN SPACEY Model Zero – supported by Thoma Holz100, Green Living, and the Berlin-Mitte Housing Society.</p>
<p>Now, we want you to join the fun and help us bring CABIN SPACEY to life!</p>
<p>Leave your mark in the very first cabin or select a building block to contribute. Be the first to spend a night in CABIN SPACEY above the city’s skyline.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>CABIN SPACEY features</b></h3>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465301557/2016_0525_Modell_yldick.jpg"" src=""""/></p></div>
<p>CABIN SPACEY is completely sustainable: Holz100 technology turns a timber house into CABIN SPACEY. A large battery solar set-up, integrated into the innovation’s sandwich floor, provides the necessary power – and even supplies the house below in case of overproduction. If desired, the flexible minimal home can also be fitted with contemporary hardware selected by its residents.</p>
<h3>Urban challenge</h3>
<p>CABIN SPACEY offers easy access to new, innovative, and purist living spaces for urban nomads or anyone else fed up with the restrictions of traditional living.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Ready to go</h3>
<p>Your support will help us realize the first prototype. The moment Model Zero is up and running and filled with life, we will attract global interest to this new type of living, inviting people to explore the experience of Cabin Spacey and enjoy the infinite possibilities of today’s intelligent living concept, designed for tomorrow.</p>

<h2>CABIN SPACEY - home anywhere</h2>
<h3>Ein neues Genre des urbanen Wohnens auf den Dächern und in jeder Nische der Stadt. Zusammen wollen wir einen Prototypen bauen!</h3>
<p>In unseren Städten hat sich der Wohnraum seit 100 Jahren nicht mehr maßgeblich verändert. Ob Altbau oder Platte - wohnen nach Schema F mit ZweiZimmerKücheBad ist Standard. Gleichzeitig wachsen unsere Städte immer weiter, bezahlbarer Wohnraum wird immer knapper und die Wohnungssuche stressiger. Dadurch ergeben sich neue urbane Herausforderungen, die mit zukunftsorientierten Wohn-Innovationen gelöst werden können. Nicht nur moderne Großstadtnomaden - heute hier, morgen dort - brauchen CABIN SPACEY. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464635741/interior_jw6qkn.jpg"" src=""""/></p> <p>CABIN SPACEY schafft Wohnraum für den Zeitgeist: nachhaltige Materialien, designed nach den wirklichen Bedürfnissen der Wohnungssuchenden. Ökologisch, modern, intelligent, modular, flexibel. Ganz gleich, wo Du wohnen willst: Cabin Spacey öffnet Wohnpotenziale, die bisher noch nicht wahrgenommen wurden. Die Minimalhäuser für das Neue Wohnen erobern den Top-Level Deiner Stadt: die Dächer. Allein in Berlin gibt es 55.000 ungenutzte Dächer, die man mit herkömmlicher Bauweise nicht nutzen kann. Aber mit CABIN SPACEY.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464636349/night_wall2neu_vfyfir.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Der Weg nach vorne führt nach ganz oben: CABIN SPACEY steht für die wachsende Nachfrage nach urbanem Wohnraum von höchster Lebensqualität und Ressourceneffizienz bei maximaler Flexibilität. Die kleinste Einheit verfügt über knapp 20m2 und kann mindestens 2 Personen beherbergen. Cabin Spacey besteht aus einer äußeren Hülle und einer inneren Versorgungseinheit mit Bad, Küchenzeile und Bett. </p>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464636921/IMG_3335_t9ifnn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Für den Großstadtnomaden bietet das Minimalhaus ideale Bedingungen: es ist leicht zu transportieren, einfach aufzustellen und lässt sich mit wenigen Handgriffen an vorhandene Infrastrukturen anschließen. Ganz gleich, ob sie sich auf ungenutzten Dächern, urbanen Brachflächen oder Parkplätzen befinden. Eine selbstbewusste Generation erobert mit CABIN SPACEY neue Wohnoasen im Großstadtdschungel. </p>
<h3>CABIN SPACEY ""Modell Null""</h3>
<p>Wir bauen den ersten Prototypen: CABIN SPACEY Modell Null. Dafür haben wir die Unterstützung von Thoma Holz100, Green Living und der Wohnbaugesellschaft Mitte. </p>
<p>Jetzt wollen wir, dass auch Ihr mit dabei seid und CABIN SPACEY mit zum Leben erweckt. Verewigt Euch im aller ersten Cabin, sucht Euch ein Bauteil aus, das ihr dazu beitragen wollt. Seid die ersten, die eine Nacht in CABIN SPACEY über den Dächern der Stadt verbringen.</p>
<h3>CABIN SPACEY Features</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465301490/2016_0525_Modell_siffxk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>CABIN SPACEY ist durch und durch ökologisch: Holz100 Technologie macht aus einem Holzhaus ein CABIN SPACEY. Eine Photovoltaik-Anlage mit einem großen Akku im Sandwich-Boden der Wohn-Innovation sorgt für den nötigen Strom - und kann bei Überproduktion sogar das Haus darunter noch mitversorgen. Das flexible Minimalhaus ist offen für zeitgemäße Hardware, mit denen die Bewohner ein CABIN SPACEY individuell ausstatten können. </p>
<h3>Urban Challenge</h3>
<p>CABIN SPACEY ist der einfache Zugang zu neuem, innovativem und puristischem Wohnraum für urbane Stadtnomaden und alle anderen, die keine Lust mehr auf die Beschränkungen herkömmlichen Wohnens legen. </p>
<h3>Ready to go</h3>
<p>Mit Eurer Unterstützung können wir einen ersten Prototypen realisieren.  Sobald Modell Null steht und mit Leben gefüllt wird, lenken wir weltweites Interesse auf die neue Wohnform, laden ein zum Erleben und Erfahren von CABIN SPACEY. Und überzeugen Interessenten von den unendlichen Möglichkeiten der intelligenten Wohnform von heute für morgen. </p>

CABIN SPACEY - home anywhere
A new genre of urban living above the roofs and in every niche of the city. Together we will build a prototype!
 
Over the past 100 years, our urban living situation has changed very little. Whether brownstone or high-rise: The average configuration of two rooms/kitchen/bath remains standard. At the same time, our cities keep growing while affordable space is at a premium, making apartment hunting increasingly stressful. The resulting new urban challenges demand progressive innovations.It’s not just modern urban nomads – here today, there tomorrow – who need CABIN SPACEY.
 

 
CABIN SPACEY offers living space that’s very much now: crafted from sustainable materials and designed to match the actual needs of those looking for a new home. Environmentally friendly, contemporary, intelligent, modular, flexible. No matter where you plan to live: Cabin Spacey exploits previously untapped potential. The minimal homes for new living conquer your city’s upper-most level – its rooftops. Berlin alone has 55,000 unused roofs that are unsuitable for regular development. This is where Cabin Spacey comes in.
 

 
The path forward takes us all the way up: CABIN SPACEY exemplifies the growing demand for high-quality, resource efficient, and extremely flexible urban living space. At just over 20 square meters, the smallest unit can easily house 2 people. CABIN SPACEY consists of an outer hull and an interior supply unit featuring a bathroom, bed, and kitchenette. For urban nomads, the minimal house is the perfect choice: It’s easy to transport, easy to install, and easily hooked up to existing utilities and infrastructures, whether unused roof, urban wasteland, or parking lot. With CABIN SPACEY, a confident generation unlocks new oases in the metropolitan jungle.
 

 
How it works
Many decision-makers are already intrigued by the idea. Negotiations with potential customers are currently under way. Our first prototype is about to see the light of day: CABIN SPACEY Model Zero – supported by Thoma Holz100, Green Living, and the Berlin-Mitte Housing Society.
Now, we want you to join the fun and help us bring CABIN SPACEY to life!
Leave your mark in the very first cabin or select a building block to contribute. Be the first to spend a night in CABIN SPACEY above the city’s skyline.
 
CABIN SPACEY features

CABIN SPACEY is completely sustainable: Holz100 technology turns a timber house into CABIN SPACEY. A large battery solar set-up, integrated into the innovation’s sandwich floor, provides the necessary power – and even supplies the house below in case of overproduction. If desired, the flexible minimal home can also be fitted with contemporary hardware selected by its residents.
Urban challenge
CABIN SPACEY offers easy access to new, innovative, and purist living spaces for urban nomads or anyone else fed up with the restrictions of traditional living.
 
Ready to go
Your support will help us realize the first prototype. The moment Model Zero is up and running and filled with life, we will attract global interest to this new type of living, inviting people to explore the experience of Cabin Spacey and enjoy the infinite possibilities of today’s intelligent living concept, designed for tomorrow.

CABIN SPACEY - home anywhere
Ein neues Genre des urbanen Wohnens auf den Dächern und in jeder Nische der Stadt. Zusammen wollen wir einen Prototypen bauen!
In unseren Städten hat sich der Wohnraum seit 100 Jahren nicht mehr maßgeblich verändert. Ob Altbau oder Platte - wohnen nach Schema F mit ZweiZimmerKücheBad ist Standard. Gleichzeitig wachsen unsere Städte immer weiter, bezahlbarer Wohnraum wird immer knapper und die Wohnungssuche stressiger. Dadurch ergeben sich neue urbane Herausforderungen, die mit zukunftsorientierten Wohn-Innovationen gelöst werden können. Nicht nur moderne Großstadtnomaden - heute hier, morgen dort - brauchen CABIN SPACEY. 
 CABIN SPACEY schafft Wohnraum für den Zeitgeist: nachhaltige Materialien, designed nach den wirklichen Bedürfnissen der Wohnungssuchenden. Ökologisch, modern, intelligent, modular, flexibel. Ganz gleich, wo Du wohnen willst: Cabin Spacey öffnet Wohnpotenziale, die bisher noch nicht wahrgenommen wurden. Die Minimalhäuser für das Neue Wohnen erobern den Top-Level Deiner Stadt: die Dächer. Allein in Berlin gibt es 55.000 ungenutzte Dächer, die man mit herkömmlicher Bauweise nicht nutzen kann. Aber mit CABIN SPACEY.

Der Weg nach vorne führt nach ganz oben: CABIN SPACEY steht für die wachsende Nachfrage nach urbanem Wohnraum von höchster Lebensqualität und Ressourceneffizienz bei maximaler Flexibilität. Die kleinste Einheit verfügt über knapp 20m2 und kann mindestens 2 Personen beherbergen. Cabin Spacey besteht aus einer äußeren Hülle und einer inneren Versorgungseinheit mit Bad, Küchenzeile und Bett. 


Für den Großstadtnomaden bietet das Minimalhaus ideale Bedingungen: es ist leicht zu transportieren, einfach aufzustellen und lässt sich mit wenigen Handgriffen an vorhandene Infrastrukturen anschließen. Ganz gleich, ob sie sich auf ungenutzten Dächern, urbanen Brachflächen oder Parkplätzen befinden. Eine selbstbewusste Generation erobert mit CABIN SPACEY neue Wohnoasen im Großstadtdschungel. 
CABIN SPACEY ""Modell Null""
Wir bauen den ersten Prototypen: CABIN SPACEY Modell Null. Dafür haben wir die Unterstützung von Thoma Holz100, Green Living und der Wohnbaugesellschaft Mitte. 
Jetzt wollen wir, dass auch Ihr mit dabei seid und CABIN SPACEY mit zum Leben erweckt. Verewigt Euch im aller ersten Cabin, sucht Euch ein Bauteil aus, das ihr dazu beitragen wollt. Seid die ersten, die eine Nacht in CABIN SPACEY über den Dächern der Stadt verbringen.
CABIN SPACEY Features

CABIN SPACEY ist durch und durch ökologisch: Holz100 Technologie macht aus einem Holzhaus ein CABIN SPACEY. Eine Photovoltaik-Anlage mit einem großen Akku im Sandwich-Boden der Wohn-Innovation sorgt für den nötigen Strom - und kann bei Überproduktion sogar das Haus darunter noch mitversorgen. Das flexible Minimalhaus ist offen für zeitgemäße Hardware, mit denen die Bewohner ein CABIN SPACEY individuell ausstatten können. 
Urban Challenge
CABIN SPACEY ist der einfache Zugang zu neuem, innovativem und puristischem Wohnraum für urbane Stadtnomaden und alle anderen, die keine Lust mehr auf die Beschränkungen herkömmlichen Wohnens legen. 
Ready to go
Mit Eurer Unterstützung können wir einen ersten Prototypen realisieren.  Sobald Modell Null steht und mit Leben gefüllt wird, lenken wir weltweites Interesse auf die neue Wohnform, laden ein zum Erleben und Erfahren von CABIN SPACEY. Und überzeugen Interessenten von den unendlichen Möglichkeiten der intelligenten Wohnform von heute für morgen.

<p>I'll always remember the day I got my USC acceptance letter as one of
 the best days of my life. I know I speak for our contributors as well 
when I say getting into the University changed me in ways that I'll 
forever be grateful. However, it also turned me into something I'm still
 not sure if I'm better for - a college sports fan. Now, set with the 
disease that is unconditional love and support for our alma mater, we've
 set out on an ambitious project that looks to add another voice to the 
chorus of news, editorials, and opinion that surrounds the University of
 Southern California. We look to make USC news FOR Trojans, BY Trojans.</p>
<p>Our
 coverage of football, basketball, and the other sports at our fine 
university will be fair, but written from a Trojan point of view. We 
make no claims to be journalists - in fact, we look to avoid the 
bureaucracy and agendas that often pervade bigger news outlets (*cough* 
ESPN *cough*), and give the news that comes out of Heritage Hall a fun, 
accesible spin. We aren't looking to change the way you see the Trojans.
 In fact, we're not looking to change anything at all. Our value lies in
 our passion, knowledge, and support of USC through good and bad, and we
 want you to be a part of that.</p>
<p>Kick the Pole will mainly function as a blog with multiple editorial sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Football - coverage and opinion of the USC Trojan football team, fun
 tweets and social media coverage of the team, and gameday experiences, 
both at the Coliseum and abroad.</li>
<li>Basketball - with the arrival of coach Andy Enfield, the basketball 
program is looking up, and we plan to be there for it. Coverage of the 
plays, players, teams and trends from the Galen Center.</li>
<li>Other Sports - including but not limited to pieces on baseball, 
water polo, volleyball, and track, this section will provdie previews 
and watch lists from the non revenue sports, along with profiles on 
especially spectacular athletes.</li>
<li>""The Student Section"" - inspired by sites such as Bleacher Report 
and BuzzFeed, we seek to supplement our more factual coverage of 
athletics with the more jovial side of being a USC student - whether it 
covers tailgating, top 10 lists, funniest tweets, pictures of passed out
 fans, etc., we seek to provide a lighthearted section of the best from 
the life of Trojans.</li>

collection of little black dresses with a unique and bold business model. The
brand is positioning itself to be THE online destination for the perfect little
black dress, knitted and produced in Montreal from responsible materials
(notably recycled polyester made from recycled water bottles and organic
cotton). GYORK&amp;VEIL makes designer dresses sold at a fraction of the price
by eliminating the middlemen and selling exclusively online. </p>
The success of crowdfunding has also inspired
this young company to launch a campaign on the <i>Indiegogo</i> platform. “We want to do business in a different way in
the fashion industry. Collective and engaging funding is something that resonates
with us,” explains Diana Györkös, co-founder of GYORK&amp;VEIL. “We strongly
believe in innovation, and we feel inspired by the audacity, energy and
authenticity displayed in the tech industry right now. We want to establish a
real relationship with our clients, and for us, crowdfunding is a way to
connect directly with our target market right from the start.” GYORK&amp;VEIL
hopes to finance part of its next production cycle as well as research and
development costs to continually improve its online store platform. Their
objective is to raise $100 000.<br/><p></p><p>GYORK&amp;VEIL, <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">makes little black dresses for all silhouettes, from XXS (0-2) to XXL (16-18). Designed, knitted and produced in Montreal from responsible materials, this start-up’s collection is made up of designer dresses sold at a fraction of the price by eliminating the middlemen and selling exclusively online.</span></p><h3>The founders</h3><p>
</p><p>Designer and
entrepreneur for nearly a decade, Melanie Veilleux quickly distinguished
herself in the Montreal fashion industry by her creativity. After a stint in
the prestigious workshops of Marie Saint Pierre, she founded FALBALA, her own
brand of women's clothing designed and manufactured in Montreal. </p>
<p>For this new line
of ready-to-wear, sold exclusively online, she ventures with Diana Györkös,
graduate of HEC with over 15 years of experience in project and operations
management. </p>
<p>This passionate
team shakes up preconceived ideas in fashion with a transparent business model,
attention to design, and a desire to showcase the beauty of all women.</p>
<p></p><p>
</p><p><b><strong>ABOUT THE COMPANY</strong> </b></p>
<p>Design - <b>Modern.
Versatile. Flattering for all figures. Highlighting the unique beauty of every
woman. </b></p>
<p>GYORK&amp;VEIL dresses are inspired by real
women. Classical, casual or sexy, they are easy to accessorize, and all
silhouettes will find the model that suits them. The brand’s trademark? Ensure
that women who wear G&amp;V dresses feel beautiful and especially good! “To
create a design, I truly get inspired by real people. For this first
collection, for example, I sat down with girlfriends and women I know and I
asked them to imagine the perfect little black jersey dress. I then drew each
dress and gave it the name of the woman who had inspired it! Each woman becomes
a muse and ambassador. This process allows us to create a variety of styles for
all kinds of women”, explains Mélanie Veilleux, designer and co-founder. “Our
dresses love women from XXS to XXL!,” is one of the brand’s taglines. </p>
<p>The little black dress is a must in a woman’s
wardrobe ; practical, versatile, easy to wear. GYORK&amp;VEIL wants to
establish itself with this piece. Dresses will also be available eventually in
other colors. </p>
<p>Open Book- <b>A transparent business model.
A model based on integrity, a relationship of trust with clients. High quality
dresses at a lower cost. </b></p>
<p>GYORK&amp;VEIL has a unique business model and
is completely transparent. The founders believe in the local economy, price transparency
and integrity of their process and products. They have cut the middlemen and
are selling their dresses exclusively online. Result: closer monitoring, from
design to production, and a more direct relationship with clients.
GYORK&amp;VEIL dresses are of superior quality and cost up to three times less
than in retail stores.</p>
<p>Sustainability - <b>Sustainable fabric
knitted in Montreal. Accessories made locally. Ethical local production.</b></p>
<p>The company founders have chosen to work with sustainable materials because
they truly believe in a better world. Dresses are all produced in Montreal from
environmentally friendly fabrics such as recycled polyester - from recycled
water bottles - or organic cottons. Accessories, such as zippers, are also
manufactured in Montreal. The goal is to reduce the company’s ecological footprint
to a minimum without sacrificing design.</p>

<p>GYORK&amp;VEIL,
un <i>start-up</i> e-commerce de mode
montréalais, lance sa collection de petites robes noires et son modèle d’affaires
unique et audacieux. La marque est désormais <i>la</i> destination en ligne pour la parfaite petite robe noire,
tricotée et produite entièrement à Montréal à partir de tissus écologiques (polyester
recyclé à base de bouteilles d'eau récupérées et coton biologique). GYORK&amp;VEIL
produit des robes de designer à une fraction du prix en éliminant les
intervenants et en vendant uniquement en ligne.</p>
<p>Le
socio-financement est un modèle qui rejoint cette jeune entreprise
avant-gardiste, d’où la campagne de <i>crowdfunding</i>
lancée sur la plateforme <i>Indiegogo</i>. <i>« Nous avons envie de faire des
affaires autrement dans le domaine de la mode. Le financement collectif et
participatif colle à nos valeurs »</i>, explique Diana Gyorkös, l’une des
deux fondatrices. « Nous croyons à l’innovation et nous sommes très
inspirées par l’audace, l’énergie et l’authenticité qui habitent les nouvelles
technologies en ce moment. Nous voulons établir un lien privilégié avec notre
clientèle, et pour nous, le socio-financement est une autre façon d’entrer en
relation directement avec notre marché-cible, dès notre lancement ». En
effet, GYORK&amp;VEIL compte financer une partie de sa prochaine production
ainsi que les coûts de recherche et développement dans le but de
continuellement améliorer sa plateforme internet. L’entreprise se fixe un
objectif de socio-financement de 100 000$.</p>
<p>GYORK&amp;VEIL,
présente ses petites robes noires pour toutes les silhouettes, de XXS (0-2) à
XXL (16-18). Dessinée, tricotée et produite à Montréal dans des matières
durables, la collection de ce start-up montréalais est constituée de robes de
designer à une fraction du prix en éliminant les intervenants et en
vendant uniquement en ligne.</p>
<p><b>LES
FONDATRICES</b></p>
<p>Designer
et chef d’entreprise depuis près d’une décennie, Mélanie Veilleux s’est rapidement
démarquée dans le milieu montréalais de la mode par sa créativité. Après un
passage dans les prestigieux ateliers de Marie Saint Pierre, elle a connu un
vif succès avec FALBALA, sa propre griffe de vêtements pour femmes conçus et
fabriqués à Montréal.</p>
<p>Pour
sa nouvelle collection de prêt-à-porter vendue exclusivement en ligne, elle
s’allie à Diana Györkös, gestionnaire émérite diplômée des HEC, spécialisée
depuis plus de 15 ans en gestion de projet et des opérations.</p>
<p> « J`ai toujours rêvé de me lancer en
affaires. Je savais que je voulais me retrouver dans un monde de création et

d’affaires transparent, un souci du design omniprésent, et un désir de mettre

PROPOS DE L’ENTREPRISE</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p><p><b>Un
modèle d’affaires transparent. Une démarche intègre, une relation de confiance
avec nos clientes. Des robes de haute qualité à un coût moindre.</b></p>
<p>GYORK&amp;VEIL
a adopté un modèle d'entreprise unique et totalement transparent. Les
fondatrices croient en l'économie locale, en la transparence des prix et à
l'intégrité de leur démarche et de leur produit.  L’entreprise a coupé les intermédiaires et vend
ses robes uniquement en ligne. Résultat : un suivi plus étroit, du design
à la production, et une relation plus directe avec les clientes. Les robes de
qualité supérieure de GYORK&amp;VEIL sont jusqu'à trois fois moins chères qu'en
boutique. </p>
<p><br/></p><p><b>Tissus
écologiques tissés à Montréal. Accessoires fabriqués localement. Confection
locale et éthique.</b></p>
<p> Les fondatrices de l’entreprise ont choisi de
travailler avec des matières durables parce qu’elles croient sincèrement à un
monde meilleur. Les robes sont toutes confectionnées à Montréal à partir de
matières écologiques, soit avec des polyesters recyclés – à partir de
bouteilles d'eau recyclées – ou des cotons biologiques. Les accessoires, tels
que les fermetures éclair, sont également fabriqués à Montréal. Le but est de
réduire au minimum l’empreinte écologique de la production, sans jamais
sacrifier le design. </p>
<p><br/></p><p><b>Moderne.
Versatile. Flatteur pour toutes les silhouettes. Pour mettre en valeur la
beauté unique de chaque femme. </b></p>
<p>Les robes
GYORK&amp;VEIL sont inspirées par des femmes réelles. Classiques, sexy ou
décontractées, elles sont faciles à accessoiriser et chaque silhouette trouvera
le modèle qui la met en valeur. La marque de commerce? Faire en sorte que les
femmes qui portent les robes GYORK&amp;VEIL se sentent belles, et surtout bien!
« Pour créer un modèle, je m’inspire réellement d'une personne. Pour cette
première collection, par exemple, je me suis assise avec des amies et des
femmes que je connais et je leur ai demandé de me dire leurs préférences pour
la petite robe noire parfaite en jersey. Ensuite, j’ai dessiné les modèles et
je leur ai donné le nom des femmes qui les ont inspirés! Donc chacune d'entre
elles devient une ambassadrice et en quelque sorte une muse. Avec cet exercice,
nous allons vraiment toucher tous les styles de robes et de femmes», explique
Mélanie Veilleux, designer et co-fondatrice de l’entreprise. D’ailleurs, un des
slogans de la marque est : « Nos robes aiment les femmes de XXS à XXL! ».</p>
<p>La petite

collection of little black dresses with a unique and bold business model. The
brand is positioning itself to be THE online destination for the perfect little

(notably recycled polyester made from recycled water bottles and organic
cotton). GYORK&VEIL makes designer dresses sold at a fraction of the price
by eliminating the middlemen and selling exclusively online. 
The success of crowdfunding has also inspired
this young company to launch a campaign on the Indiegogo platform. “We want to do business in a different way in
the fashion industry. Collective and engaging funding is something that resonates
with us,” explains Diana Györkös, co-founder of GYORK&VEIL. “We strongly
believe in innovation, and we feel inspired by the audacity, energy and
authenticity displayed in the tech industry right now. We want to establish a
real relationship with our clients, and for us, crowdfunding is a way to
connect directly with our target market right from the start.” GYORK&VEIL
hopes to finance part of its next production cycle as well as research and
development costs to continually improve its online store platform. Their
objective is to raise $100 000.GYORK&VEIL, makes little black dresses for all silhouettes, from XXS (0-2) to XXL (16-18). Designed, knitted and produced in Montreal from responsible materials, this start-up’s collection is made up of designer dresses sold at a fraction of the price by eliminating the middlemen and selling exclusively online.The founders
Designer and
entrepreneur for nearly a decade, Melanie Veilleux quickly distinguished
herself in the Montreal fashion industry by her creativity. After a stint in
the prestigious workshops of Marie Saint Pierre, she founded FALBALA, her own
brand of women's clothing designed and manufactured in Montreal. 
For this new line
of ready-to-wear, sold exclusively online, she ventures with Diana Györkös,
graduate of HEC with over 15 years of experience in project and operations
management. 
This passionate
team shakes up preconceived ideas in fashion with a transparent business model,
attention to design, and a desire to showcase the beauty of all women.

ABOUT THE COMPANY 
Design - Modern.
Versatile. Flattering for all figures. Highlighting the unique beauty of every
woman. 
GYORK&VEIL dresses are inspired by real
women. Classical, casual or sexy, they are easy to accessorize, and all
silhouettes will find the model that suits them. The brand’s trademark? Ensure
that women who wear G&V dresses feel beautiful and especially good! “To
create a design, I truly get inspired by real people. For this first
collection, for example, I sat down with girlfriends and women I know and I
asked them to imagine the perfect little black jersey dress. I then drew each
dress and gave it the name of the woman who had inspired it! Each woman becomes
a muse and ambassador. This process allows us to create a variety of styles for
all kinds of women”, explains Mélanie Veilleux, designer and co-founder. “Our
dresses love women from XXS to XXL!,” is one of the brand’s taglines. 
The little black dress is a must in a woman’s
wardrobe ; practical, versatile, easy to wear. GYORK&VEIL wants to
establish itself with this piece. Dresses will also be available eventually in
other colors. 
Open Book- A transparent business model.
A model based on integrity, a relationship of trust with clients. High quality
dresses at a lower cost. 
GYORK&VEIL has a unique business model and
is completely transparent. The founders believe in the local economy, price transparency
and integrity of their process and products. They have cut the middlemen and
are selling their dresses exclusively online. Result: closer monitoring, from
design to production, and a more direct relationship with clients.
GYORK&VEIL dresses are of superior quality and cost up to three times less
than in retail stores.
Sustainability - Sustainable fabric
knitted in Montreal. Accessories made locally. Ethical local production.
The company founders have chosen to work with sustainable materials because
they truly believe in a better world. Dresses are all produced in Montreal from
environmentally friendly fabrics such as recycled polyester - from recycled
water bottles - or organic cottons. Accessories, such as zippers, are also
manufactured in Montreal. The goal is to reduce the company’s ecological footprint
to a minimum without sacrificing design.

GYORK&VEIL,
un start-up e-commerce de mode
montréalais, lance sa collection de petites robes noires et son modèle d’affaires
unique et audacieux. La marque est désormais la destination en ligne pour la parfaite petite robe noire,
tricotée et produite entièrement à Montréal à partir de tissus écologiques (polyester
recyclé à base de bouteilles d'eau récupérées et coton biologique). GYORK&VEIL
produit des robes de designer à une fraction du prix en éliminant les
intervenants et en vendant uniquement en ligne.
Le
socio-financement est un modèle qui rejoint cette jeune entreprise
avant-gardiste, d’où la campagne de crowdfunding
lancée sur la plateforme Indiegogo. « Nous avons envie de faire des
affaires autrement dans le domaine de la mode. Le financement collectif et
participatif colle à nos valeurs », explique Diana Gyorkös, l’une des
deux fondatrices. « Nous croyons à l’innovation et nous sommes très
inspirées par l’audace, l’énergie et l’authenticité qui habitent les nouvelles
technologies en ce moment. Nous voulons établir un lien privilégié avec notre
clientèle, et pour nous, le socio-financement est une autre façon d’entrer en
relation directement avec notre marché-cible, dès notre lancement ». En
effet, GYORK&VEIL compte financer une partie de sa prochaine production
ainsi que les coûts de recherche et développement dans le but de
continuellement améliorer sa plateforme internet. L’entreprise se fixe un
objectif de socio-financement de 100 000$.
GYORK&VEIL,
présente ses petites robes noires pour toutes les silhouettes, de XXS (0-2) à
XXL (16-18). Dessinée, tricotée et produite à Montréal dans des matières
durables, la collection de ce start-up montréalais est constituée de robes de
designer à une fraction du prix en éliminant les intervenants et en
vendant uniquement en ligne.
LES
FONDATRICES
Designer
et chef d’entreprise depuis près d’une décennie, Mélanie Veilleux s’est rapidement
démarquée dans le milieu montréalais de la mode par sa créativité. Après un
passage dans les prestigieux ateliers de Marie Saint Pierre, elle a connu un
vif succès avec FALBALA, sa propre griffe de vêtements pour femmes conçus et
fabriqués à Montréal.
Pour
sa nouvelle collection de prêt-à-porter vendue exclusivement en ligne, elle
s’allie à Diana Györkös, gestionnaire émérite diplômée des HEC, spécialisée
depuis plus de 15 ans en gestion de projet et des opérations.
 « J`ai toujours rêvé de me lancer en
affaires. Je savais que je voulais me retrouver dans un monde de création et
que je ne voulais pas le faire seule. Il faut de la patience pour trouver la
bonne idée et je crois sincèrement qu’une entreprise solide se construit sur
une amitié solide. C`est ce que je retrouve avec mon associée Mélanie», mentionne
Diana.
Cette
équipe passionnée bouscule les idées reçues sur la mode actuelle avec un modèle
d’affaires transparent, un souci du design omniprésent, et un désir de mettre

<p><b>Q. If my question is not answered here, how do I ask ?</b></p>
<p>A. Please email us at talktous@tenvas.com</p> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q. Will the size of the watch fit me?</b></p>
<p>A. Yes, it will. We will get your wrist measurements and 3d print a size that best fits your wrist. It is in fact customised for your wrist. Similar to how a tailor would tailor-make suits and gowns.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Q. Will the watch be water and splash resistant?</b></p>
<p>A Yes, it is tested to be water resistant up to 3 atm or 30m. The 3D printed material will retain its colour even after prolonged exposure to water.</p>

Why should we accept brands that sell us clothing that is deliberately designed to wear out after just a year or two?
Many big fashion brands make their clothing knowing that it will fall apart, so that their customers will have to return to buy more. It’s called built-in obsolescence, and it creates a cycle of consumption and waste that’s become all too common these days.We believe brands should sell their clothes based on the quality of their designs and a customer should return to buy more because they have released a great new product, not return to buy the same wardrobe staple that's been systemically produced to fall apart.

It's time to return to that bygone era where clothing was made so beautifully it could last a lifetime. Partnering with a group of old school Portuguese craftsmen, who have been hand-making clothing since 1964, we have created a luxury cotton crewneck t-shirt that is so well made we are backing it up with a 30 Year Guarantee.Together we can create a more sustainable fashion industry and lead a trend towards truly durable clothing. Starting right here, with The 30 Year T-Shirt.

This resulted in the release of Tom's best-selling Nigel Olsson Navy Pants.Tom Cridland's premium organic cotton crewneck sweatshirts have been acclaimed by everyone from the BBC to THE INDEPENDENT to THE HUFFINGTON POST, which makes us very confident we can deliver you the world's perfect t-shirt.We have spent the past year meticulously developing The 30 Year T-Shirt because it's ok to pay for luxury, just don't pay too much.CONTACTBackers: customerservices@tomcridland.co.ukBusiness Enquiries: tc@tomcridland.co.ukPress Enquiries: tc@tomcridland.co.ukFAQs
How do you select your size and color of preference?

What We Need & What You Get I am trying to raise about $800 for material costs such as some beautiful beaded fabrics, satins, sheers and laces.  As well as small materials like lining fabrics, boning, lace trim etc.  
I have special perks for donors! Check them out to the right.  
If I get more donations than needed it will go towards further awesome fashion projects.
    The Impact I am a Colorado based designer and I wish to share my designs nationally and hopefully one day internationally.  This show gives me the opportunity to show in the fashion capital along with other amazing designers and artists.
Since I showed in New York in September of 2013 I have been published in several magazine publications and worked with some of Colorado's best photographers, makeup/hair artists, and models.
I am looking forward to meeting  new people in New York and expanding my network of people!
   Risks & Challenges Presently my only challenge is finances.  I make very detailed and intricate designs which take a lot of materials.  My other challenge is time, however I will seek help from other seamstress and forego sleep if needed.
    Other Ways You Can Help Please share this campaign to help an awesome collection be made!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

That is where we come in. Green Matters Natural Dye Company is a natural dyeing service to clothing and fiber product company with sustainability incorporated into their company and brand image. We use plant materials that can be found all over the world and can even be sourced locally in Lancaster County, PA. We cook down the plant materials, strain them out, and introduce the fiber (yarn or fabric) into large dye pots for coloring. Once the dyed fiber is dried, the finished product is delivered to our customer.</p><p>We are currently working out of Winona's home. Even though it has served us well, it is time for us to move into a warehouse. When moving along with upgrading our equipment and processes, we will be able to at least double our production capabilities. We have gained solid traction in the first year of our operation, and it is not out of reach for us to be working with industry leaders like Patagonia in the next two years. </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>By contributing to our campaign, you are not only helping efforts to clean up local water ways, but also the water pollution problem of the world at large. For each yard of fabric that we dye, we are eliminating the contamination of anywhere from 15-30 gallons of water. As our company grows, we will go from eliminating the contamination of thousands of gallons of water to millions.</p><p>Our business is also positively impacts the Lancaster County area. As our company grows, we will be providing jobs for all skill levels. We also will be supporting the Lancaster agricultural community by purchasing our dye materials from the local farms and greenhouses.</p><h3>Meet the Co-founders</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504579252/wbt6wjpohs0jif2zgrvx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Winona Quigley is a dyer, designer and photographer who grew up in Lancaster County.

<p>At <a href=""https://brykerhyde.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bryker Hyde</a> we have always been drawn to artisan crafted leather products. But the truth is we wanted the quality of a higher priced item but couldn't justify the cost. We figured exquisite hand selected leather, detailed stitching and practical designs were out of our budget. If this was true for us than it must be for others too.</p>
<p>So we began designing our own leather goods. We started with wallets and are now ready to expand the Bryker Hyde experience by launching a product that we love and have been asked for on numerous occasions: <strong><i>Exquisite Leather Messenger Bags</i></strong>. </p>
<p>Our messenger bags are available two unique styles: <strong>Buffalo Brown &amp; Mustang Brown. </strong> Each bag is handcrafted with full grain cowhide leather and treated using the crazy horse leather technique; a specialized technique that gives the bag a unique and antique appearance while retaining its ruggedness and durability.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Why use Crazy Horse Leather?    </h3>
<p>Most widely used for horse saddles, <strong>the crazy horse leather technique is specially processed to have an antique appearance while retaining its ruggedness and durability</strong>. Our artisan leather bags will be made out of handpicked Full Grain Leather.</p>
<p>In fact, the more you use it, the better it will look. Your bag will gradually change in appearance and take on natural character. Most leathers are heavily coated with chemicals, paints, oils and pigments which shorten its lifespan. Your bag is not one of these. <strong>With our combination of fine leather and quality craftsmanship, your bag will last you a lifetime.</strong></p>
<p><i>*Dye Transfer - Our Buffalo Brown leather is treated with a dark dye that when damp or wet with excessive friction can transfer on to white and light colored clothing. </i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508122289/qrojxt2df9fzk2to34uo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h2>The Bryker Hyde Experience</h2>
<p>You might not believe it, but Bryker Hyde started as a wallet company by a regular guy, just like you, back in 2015. Working a regular day job and, ""burning the midnight oil"", designing wallets at night. </p>
<p>At Bryker Hyde we have always been drawn to artisan crafted leather products. But the truth is we wanted the quality of a higher priced item but couldn't justify the cost. We figured exquisite leather, detailed stitching and practical designs were out of our budget. If this was true for us than it must be for others too.</p>
<p>This inspired us to start designing and manufacturing our own leather goods. Over the past two years we have invested thousands of dollars and countless hours into fine tuning and creating our products. Obsessed with quality and focused on affordable pricing, the Bryker Hyde team continues to innovate and develop new designs so that you too can enjoy artisan crafted leather goods without having to break the bank.</p>

But the truth is we wanted the quality of a higher priced item but couldn't justify the cost. We figured exquisite hand selected leather, detailed stitching and practical designs were out of our budget. If this was true for us than it must be for others too.
So we began designing our own leather goods. We started with wallets and are now ready to expand the Bryker Hyde experience by launching a product that we love and have been asked for on numerous occasions: Exquisite Leather Messenger Bags. 
Our messenger bags are available two unique styles: Buffalo Brown & Mustang Brown.  Each bag is handcrafted with full grain cowhide leather and treated using the crazy horse leather technique; a specialized technique that gives the bag a unique and antique appearance while retaining its ruggedness and durability.

Side-by-side comparison, Medium & Large Bags

 
Why use Crazy Horse Leather?    
Most widely used for horse saddles, the crazy horse leather technique is specially processed to have an antique appearance while retaining its ruggedness and durability. Our artisan leather bags will be made out of handpicked Full Grain Leather.
In fact, the more you use it, the better it will look. Your bag will gradually change in appearance and take on natural character. Most leathers are heavily coated with chemicals, paints, oils and pigments which shorten its lifespan. Your bag is not one of these. With our combination of fine leather and quality craftsmanship, your bag will last you a lifetime.
*Dye Transfer - Our Buffalo Brown leather is treated with a dark dye that when damp or wet with excessive friction can transfer on to white and light colored clothing.

The Bryker Hyde Experience
You might not believe it, but Bryker Hyde started as a wallet company by a regular guy, just like you, back in 2015. Working a regular day job and, ""burning the midnight oil"", designing wallets at night. 
At Bryker Hyde we have always been drawn to artisan crafted leather products. But the truth is we wanted the quality of a higher priced item but couldn't justify the cost. We figured exquisite leather, detailed stitching and practical designs were out of our budget. If this was true for us than it must be for others too.
This inspired us to start designing and manufacturing our own leather goods. Over the past two years we have invested thousands of dollars and countless hours into fine tuning and creating our products. Obsessed with quality and focused on affordable pricing, the Bryker Hyde team continues to innovate and develop new designs so that you too can enjoy artisan crafted leather goods without having to break the bank.

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Hello!</h3> </b><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>My name is
Bernadette and I am the founder of ono. For years I have been pondering about
how to improve the ethical practices in business. I wanted respect and care for both humans and nature<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px;"">. </span></p>
<p>ono is my dream of creating a new normal. ono is driven by
the question of how to do business in the most sustainable and cooperative
way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two years
ago, while working for an NGO in Indonesia, I started looking for the best
possible natural and sustainable materials. The following year I met my business partner Nadine, built a team,
bought a couple of sewing machines and started to train local women in Bali to
manufacture bags. </p>
<p>
After almost two
years of intense learning and attempting to excel, our first line of awe-inspiring bags is now
ready:</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>For two
years I passionately invested a lot of my time (as well as my savings) to get
to a point where I now have a great team, a number of reliable and well-trained
seamstresses, as well as suppliers for sustainable materials. </p>
<p>So far we only
produced a small amount. Now we are ready to take ono to the next level. We
need your help to turn the dream of a ‘new normal’ into a shared reality. </p>

</div><p><i><b></b></i></p><p><b>A unique, highly sustainable material combination</b></p>
<p></p><p>
</p><p>We’re not
the first ones to use cork for bags. What not many people know is that the cork
layer is only 0.2 mm thick and is glued onto a backing material. Mostly on polyester,
plastic and sometimes on regular cotton (which get’s treated with loads of
chemicals). The cork is sustainable, but not the material combination. This
wasn’t good enough for us. </p>
<p><i><b></b></i></p><p><i><b>Therefore we decided to make it better:</b></i></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>A sustainable backing material <br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px;""></span>
</b><p>We use organically
certified tencel<sup>®</sup>, an incredibly strong and functional fibre made
from wood pulp of mostly eucalyptus trees. Even the dye used for our tencel<sup>®</sup>
is organically certified.  (more details
below)</p></span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Water based glue<span><br/></span></b></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To combine
the tencel</span><sup style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">®</sup><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and cork we use water-based glue as it creates the least
possible impact on the environment. </span>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Natural colour<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
<p>To dye cork
with a good quality result usually requires strong chemicals. The less cork is
processed, the more sustainable and environmentally friendly its use becomes.
Therefore we chose to go with its natural colour.</p></span>
</li>
</ul><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><p></p>
<ul><li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Only natural materials <br/></b><span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px;"">
<p>We didn’t
want to stop at the outside material. We decided to use eco-friendly materials
to create our bags like organic bamboo and organic cotton, both naturally dyed.
And for our buttons we chose reclaimed teak. </p></span>

(cor affection/tablet sleeve)



Hello! 



My name is
Bernadette and I am the founder of ono. For years I have been pondering about
how to improve the ethical practices in business. I wanted respect and care for both humans and nature. 
ono is my dream of creating a new normal. ono is driven by
the question of how to do business in the most sustainable and cooperative
way.

Two years
ago, while working for an NGO in Indonesia, I started looking for the best
possible natural and sustainable materials. The following year I met my business partner Nadine, built a team,
bought a couple of sewing machines and started to train local women in Bali to
manufacture bags. 

After almost two
years of intense learning and attempting to excel, our first line of awe-inspiring bags is now
ready:





Produced under human-friendly conditions 
Entirely made from sustainable materials 
Innovative material combination of cork and tencel®
Unique and beautiful design 







(cor unity/unisex bag & cor courage/awesomeness bag)



Why crowdfunding?
 



For two
years I passionately invested a lot of my time (as well as my savings) to get
to a point where I now have a great team, a number of reliable and well-trained
seamstresses, as well as suppliers for sustainable materials. 
So far we only
produced a small amount. Now we are ready to take ono to the next level. We
need your help to turn the dream of a ‘new normal’ into a shared reality. 
Back us. Invest
through us in a new ethical approach of doing business. And be one of the first to receive one of our
awe-inspiring bags.






(cor compassion / wallet & cor love / shoulderbag)
   What makes us different? 
A unique, highly sustainable material combination

We’re not
the first ones to use cork for bags. What not many people know is that the cork
layer is only 0.2 mm thick and is glued onto a backing material. Mostly on polyester,
plastic and sometimes on regular cotton (which get’s treated with loads of
chemicals). The cork is sustainable, but not the material combination. This
wasn’t good enough for us. 
Therefore we decided to make it better:


A sustainable backing material 
We use organically
certified tencel®, an incredibly strong and functional fibre made
from wood pulp of mostly eucalyptus trees. Even the dye used for our tencel®
is organically certified.  (more details
below)


Water based glueTo combine
the tencel® and cork we use water-based glue as it creates the least
possible impact on the environment. 


 Natural colour
To dye cork
with a good quality result usually requires strong chemicals. The less cork is
processed, the more sustainable and environmentally friendly its use becomes.
Therefore we chose to go with its natural colour.



Only natural materials 
We didn’t
want to stop at the outside material. We decided to use eco-friendly materials
to create our bags like organic bamboo and organic cotton, both naturally dyed.
And for our buttons we chose reclaimed teak. 




(cor life/laptop sleeve  & cor intuition/yogabag)

Human-friendly and fair 





We trained
individual women to work from home to produce our products and support their
own small business while being with their family and children. If needed, we
bought sewing machines. The women paid these back with a part of their earning.
They are free to do with them as they please. Additionally, we started working
with smaller local workshops to support existing local businesses. 



Local production. We’re based in Indonesia. We support local producers in Indonesia.


Family-friendly working hours.
Our
manufacturers are free to work when it’s best for them.


Fair paymentFor their work we pay our manufacturers fair wages far above the regional standards.


Independence & Empowerment
We provide
training and manufacturing tools. We don’t tie our workers down. They are free
to use our loaned sewing machines for their own purposes.

Risks & Challenges
  
We've done our learning, and now we're ready to take ono to the next level. We've chosen flexible funding because, regardless of the outcome, we've got the set up and are ready to produce. 
The funding amount will simply determine the number of bags we can produce. And we certainly hope for the best to achieve our goal!

<h2>About The Project</h2>
<p>Hiya indiegogo-ers! We are WOODIES, and we make iphone skins for the 4 and 4s out of laser cut veneers. We work with a really awesome team of artists and designers to make your iphone beautiful and unique.</p>
<p>The wood we use is a walnut, which adds a touch of natural warmth to the design of the iphone, without adding any bulk. There is a 3M adhesive backing on the skin that will form a semi-permanent bond on your iphone. This can be removed later with no residue.</p>
<p>We are located in Los Angeles, California, and we do all of the work ourselves. No outsourcing to China! We believe that there are massive problems with having to make a million units of a product just to reach ""scale"". We believe in small business, and local craftmanship, and so should you!</p>
<p><img alt=""4 designs"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.getwoodies.com/images/array.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Why we need to raise $15,000</h3>
<p>We're trying to get our very own laser cutter in order to produce these quickly and efficiently (laser cutters are EXPENSIVE), and at a reduced cost to buyers, so our goal is 15,000, but if we don't make that goal, we'll still be able to make and ship all of your skins :)</p>
<p>We've done a lot of research and found that our best bet is going to be a Hurricane Lasers 100W ""Andrew"" laser cutter, which runs $11,395 + Shipping, as well as an air purifier ($1,595). We'll be spending the rest on walnut veneer, and shipping for your rewards.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://getwoodies.com/shop-2/images/21/camera_closeup.jpg/"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Also, we want to hear from you! We're accepting submissions for designs, and if your design is chosen, you will be able to receive a percentage of each case with your design on it. We want to support artists, and support small, agile, and innovative business. </p>

<h3>Custom Designs</h3>
<p>Once the fundraising has ended, we'll send out detailed instructions to those who ordered custom skins on what the best format to send us artwork, logos, or designs. The process will be relatively painless. You will be able to format your artwork in photoshop or gimp (which is free and open source).</p>
<h3>Shipping</h3>
<p>Shipping is free in the USA.  International shipping is $10.</p>

<div><br/></div>
<p> In 2013, MELT THE ICE was a one man business. The founder of MELT THE ICE was studying apparel design at the university last year when she happened to watch a video of the blind and of the blind's life. This was something she had never thought before and it motivated her to set up the MELT THE ICE company.</p>
<p> Until last year, she merely sold bags and did common things such as contributing and donating to the blind which is what most social enterprises do. It was quite easy to help the blind by this sort of financial aid. <b>However, what was truly important was that they dream of their future on their own and overcome the challenges they face throughout their lives.</b> Despite its importance, this spirit has been neglected by government and the majority of social enterprises. However, we point out that MELT THE ICE is not like those other enterprises. <b>We proudly declare that ""MELT THE ICE can motivate the blind with this spirit!"".</b></p>
<p> Moreover, I who write for Indiegogo's campaign also bought one of her bags. I vividly remember when the founder of MELT THE ICE and I met to receive my bag. She told me about MELT THE ICE's brand story and handed me the one and only existing bag in the world. <b>At that time, It was my first time to hear about the blind, but afterwards, everytime I carry MELT THE ICE's bag, I think of the blind.</b> This is why I am currently working for this organization.</p>
<p> Now, What I will introduce through Indiegogo will be different from the previous work of MELT THE ICE. We are attempting to add a new value. <b>This time it will not just a bag for contribution and donation, but it will include the blind's stories and also something invisible to the bare eye.</b> It is time to tell warm tales that will melt the world.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>BAGS WITH AN INVISIBLE CHARM!</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p><b>1, Our bag include stories of the blind</b></p>

<p> This is one of bags we made. However, as it may seem like just a bag, it is not so. The bag itself includes the stories of the blind. MELT THE ICE puts someone's dream and hope into the bag.</p><p><br/></p>

When he was in his mother's belly, his mother took a drug for personal reasons. Unfortunately, it was the wrong drug and it caused side effects to the baby.<b> As a result, he was born with several disabilities and they affected him ever since his birth and the year he turned eleven, he lost his sight completely.</b></p>
<p> To overcome his disabilities, he tried to do whatever he could; he engrossed in making money, so he could afford to get a surgery. In spite of his effort, his disease was immedicable. He was in great sorrow and he was deeply troubled. His daily life was miserable. Nevertheless, this is how he talks about his life:</p>
<p><i><b>"" I have went through many hardships. On such occasions, I eventually overcame my hardships thanks to two principles: One is to humbly conform to God and the other is to believe that there is nothing that  I cannot overcome. Thus, my life can be described by two words : "" HUMILITY, and CHALLENGE"".</b></i></p>

He just really enjoys taking pictures. He also published quite a few poetical books.</p>
<p><br/></p><p>Below, there are some of his works.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/902484/files/20141003171525-_5.JPG?1412381725"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/902573/files/20141003181548-_2.JPG?1412385348"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> <b>He wants to have an exhibition of his works. He wants to share his works pictured by his inner eyes and heart to his audience. Additionally, MELT THE ICE will help KIM's display throughout this campaign.</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p> He has constantly tried to break people's prejudice on the blind; that the blind cannot do artistic activities whatsoever. Whether with or without MELT THE ICE, he will continue to do so.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>2.

<p> We use braille when crafting the bags. This word means ""CHALLENGE"". This word indicates the life of this bag's main character, Kyoung Sik Kim. We send you his whole story by using braille.</p><p><br/></p>

<p> Because each person has his or her own unique life story, we design a bag only once. There are no two identical bags. In other words, KIM's bag will never again be reproduced.</p><p><br/></p>

 In 2013, MELT THE ICE was a one man business. The founder of MELT THE ICE was studying apparel design at the university last year when she happened to watch a video of the blind and of the blind's life. This was something she had never thought before and it motivated her to set up the MELT THE ICE company.
 Until last year, she merely sold bags and did common things such as contributing and donating to the blind which is what most social enterprises do. It was quite easy to help the blind by this sort of financial aid. However, what was truly important was that they dream of their future on their own and overcome the challenges they face throughout their lives. Despite its importance, this spirit has been neglected by government and the majority of social enterprises. However, we point out that MELT THE ICE is not like those other enterprises. We proudly declare that ""MELT THE ICE can motivate the blind with this spirit!"".
 Moreover, I who write for Indiegogo's campaign also bought one of her bags. I vividly remember when the founder of MELT THE ICE and I met to receive my bag. She told me about MELT THE ICE's brand story and handed me the one and only existing bag in the world. At that time, It was my first time to hear about the blind, but afterwards, everytime I carry MELT THE ICE's bag, I think of the blind. This is why I am currently working for this organization.
 Now, What I will introduce through Indiegogo will be different from the previous work of MELT THE ICE. We are attempting to add a new value. This time it will not just a bag for contribution and donation, but it will include the blind's stories and also something invisible to the bare eye. It is time to tell warm tales that will melt the world.

BAGS WITH AN INVISIBLE CHARM!

1, Our bag include stories of the blind

 This is one of bags we made. However, as it may seem like just a bag, it is not so. The bag itself includes the stories of the blind. MELT THE ICE puts someone's dream and hope into the bag.
""MELT THE ICE, the first page - By Kyoung Sik Kim""
 He lost his sight when he was eleven, not because of a heredity effect, but because of an unexpected accident. When he was in his mother's belly, his mother took a drug for personal reasons. Unfortunately, it was the wrong drug and it caused side effects to the baby. As a result, he was born with several disabilities and they affected him ever since his birth and the year he turned eleven, he lost his sight completely.
 To overcome his disabilities, he tried to do whatever he could; he engrossed in making money, so he could afford to get a surgery. In spite of his effort, his disease was immedicable. He was in great sorrow and he was deeply troubled. His daily life was miserable. Nevertheless, this is how he talks about his life:
"" I have went through many hardships. On such occasions, I eventually overcame my hardships thanks to two principles: One is to humbly conform to God and the other is to believe that there is nothing that  I cannot overcome. Thus, my life can be described by two words : "" HUMILITY, and CHALLENGE"".
 His life philosophy is greatly shown in his works of pictures and poems. Though he is not able to see, he can write poems and take pictures with the eye of his mind. He began to take pictures in 2011 and the quantity of his works exceeds 10,000 already. He just really enjoys taking pictures. He also published quite a few poetical books.
Below, there are some of his works. He wants to have an exhibition of his works. He wants to share his works pictured by his inner eyes and heart to his audience. Additionally, MELT THE ICE will help KIM's display throughout this campaign.
 He has constantly tried to break people's prejudice on the blind; that the blind cannot do artistic activities whatsoever. Whether with or without MELT THE ICE, he will continue to do so.

2. The bags have braille on them
 We use braille when crafting the bags. This word means ""CHALLENGE"". This word indicates the life of this bag's main character, Kyoung Sik Kim. We send you his whole story by using braille.
