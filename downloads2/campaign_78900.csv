<p>Hello! My name is Ben and I am a guitarist, musician, and songwriter. I started playing in a band called Worth Road 3 years ago, and have toured and recorded with various artists off and on over the last 5 years, but after a few recent events, I feel it impressed upon myself to record and release a solo album, and put some energy into a new and fresh musical expedition with a new and fresh musical direction. I put everything that I have into my music and after independently recording a self-funded full-length instrumental CD in 2012, which was only released to a handful of people, I am ready to record my next full-length album entitled ""Genosis""!</p>
<p>This album is important to me because it is the biggest step I have ever taken in my musical career, being the first album that I have ever sang lead on, as well as the first ever recording that I have played drums on. I have one song almost fully recorded for you so far to give you a taste of what is to come with this album, but I need your help to finish this song and to complete the remaining 14 songs for this album.</p>
<p>$101,000. I know that is an exceptionally large number, but making music is expensive, and especially making it right. Which is how I want to record this album. I always want to make sure that I am giving 101% (hehe) to my music. There are many high costs involved (production, equipment, session musicians, mixing, mastering, artwork, pressing, publicity...just to name few!). If I am blessed enough to raise more than my goal, then I will definitely record more songs for you.</p>
<p>I have a list of incentives to accommodate all fans and samaritans, no matter your financial ability to help make this happen. Also, purchasing the CD up front is like a pre-order for you, while also making it possible for me to record the CD – so everybody wins!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for visiting my page, I appreciate you more than I will ever be able to express! And if you feel led, please share this link with your social networks. I can’t do this without you, and I will forever remember the contributors who made this possible for me. God bless you. </p>

<p><strong>""Pauline Reese is my favorite female artist.""</strong><strong>~ Willie Nelson</strong></p><div>
</div><p><strong>Pauline Reese</strong> was twice named ""Entertainer of The Year"" by the Texas Music Association and has successfully carved her name in the male-dominated music business, touring with such notable Texas acts as Cory Morrow, Jack Ingram, Kevin Fowler and Pat Green. With a magnetic stage presence, quick wit and a smoking band, she performs regularly around Texas &amp; Oklahoma.<br/></p><div>
</div><p>If Pauline Reese had been born in the 1800s, she would have used a plow and a Henry rifle to carve her place the Wild West. Instead, she’s slinging a guitar and sharp-edged lyrics to blaze a trail in a man’s world of outlaw country music and staking milestones along the way, including praise from Willie Nelson as his favorite female vocalist and from the Texas Music Awards as the reigning entertainer of the year – the first woman to earn that honor. <br/></p><div>
</div><p><span>Pauline’s albums won critical acclaim since her self-titled debut in 1999. Willie joined her for a duet on “Pick Up the Pieces” on her 2004 CD “The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.” The Texas Music Awards bestowed album of the year honors on her 2007 CD “Too Texas,” a collection of her classics and others’. Her sixth CD, “Just Getting Started,” reveals Pauline’s growth as an artist in a powerful collection of folk, pop rock and alternative and contemporary country that reflects a life being lived to its fullest – from a leaving a rocky marriage and finding new love and a new role as a wife and mother with two young daughters to all the highs and lows in between.</span><br/><br/><span>For Pauline, there are plenty of trails yet to blaze. As the chorus in her latest CD’s title track says, “I’ve just hit my stride this ride ain’t over yet/ My heart is racing to see what’s waiting up </span><span>ahead/ I’m about to make my mark/ Yeah, I’m just getting started.” ""I am full of surprises,"" sings Pauline Reese on opener ""Just Getting Started,"" and the Austinite's not kidding. </span></p><div>
</div><p><span>Reese challenges Carrie Underwood for Nashville good looks, but she's a crack Texas songwriter (""First Love"") in the tradition of Dolly Parton (""Beautiful Shame,"" ""Front Porch Sunday"") and spends half the year on the road honing that craft.

<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><b>HERE A LITTLE STORY ABOUT THE IDEA </b></p>
<p>The design idea for Studio42 floated in my head for about 5 years before i put it on paper with the help of Architect/Designer Pietro Pagliaro.</p>
<p>For an Entire year we sketched, scrapped, burned and tossed A LOT of ideas over pizzas and beers, occasionally pasta... but mainly pizza... more on that later.  </p>
<p>We finally set out on a basic layout and after a lot of pizzas and beers </p>
<p>though it felt as if ..... as if... we just ate pizzas and beers.... and the design was taking 2 steps forward and 3 steps back. </p>
<p>We've then decided to switch to pasta with pesto for our meetings and it is then...and only then, that things started to take shape!! call it pesto synchronicity or beer serendipity, I don't know...but something deeply influenced our neurons. </p>
<p>We've finally come up with a cohesive idea.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The most difficult part was to combine acoustical properties/materials, ergonomics,isolation and the design. Pietro wants things pretty, I want things to sound good and occasionally be pretty where i need them to be, we've balanced each other out quite well. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The main live room can </span>shape shift<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> from one large live room where you can track BIG DRUMS and shoot videos and pictures, to 3 separate rooms with </span>sight lines<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> for isolation, just in case someone out there </span>does't like mic bleed into their recordings, I do like it but let's leave this discussion for another time.. </p>
<p>It feels like most of the work, is now behind us. Now we need to BUILD! and here is where you come in! </p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><b>WHAT THE STUDIO CAN DO </b></p>
<p>Studio 42 will be geared for high end recordings, with or without sound separation between the instruments. </p>
<p>The lighting and the colors/textures will be geared towards filming and giving a cinematic look to the footage. </p>
<p>The space can be opened up and accommodate a live intimate concert with an audience. </p>
<p>Backdrops of different colors can be pulled from the ceiling and be your best friends during a photo shoot or video shoot. </p>
<p>There are many more combinations.. and i hope we will discover them together during this new year! </p>

The design idea for Studio42 floated in my head for about 5 years before i put it on paper with the help of Architect/Designer Pietro Pagliaro.
For an Entire year we sketched, scrapped, burned and tossed A LOT of ideas over pizzas and beers, occasionally pasta... but mainly pizza... more on that later.  
We finally set out on a basic layout and after a lot of pizzas and beers 
though it felt as if ..... as if... we just ate pizzas and beers.... and the design was taking 2 steps forward and 3 steps back. 
We've then decided to switch to pasta with pesto for our meetings and it is then...and only then, that things started to take shape!! call it pesto synchronicity or beer serendipity, I don't know...but something deeply influenced our neurons. 
We've finally come up with a cohesive idea.
The most difficult part was to combine acoustical properties/materials, ergonomics,isolation and the design. Pietro wants things pretty, I want things to sound good and occasionally be pretty where i need them to be, we've balanced each other out quite well. 
The main live room can shape shift from one large live room where you can track BIG DRUMS and shoot videos and pictures, to 3 separate rooms with sight lines for isolation, just in case someone out there does't like mic bleed into their recordings, I do like it but let's leave this discussion for another time.. 
It feels like most of the work, is now behind us. Now we need to BUILD! and here is where you come in! 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT THE STUDIO CAN DO 
Studio 42 will be geared for high end recordings, with or without sound separation between the instruments. 
The lighting and the colors/textures will be geared towards filming and giving a cinematic look to the footage. 
The space can be opened up and accommodate a live intimate concert with an audience. 
Backdrops of different colors can be pulled from the ceiling and be your best friends during a photo shoot or video shoot. 
There are many more combinations.. and i hope we will discover them together during this new year! 

Thank you for the support!

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>For those of you who do not know who I am, my name is Morgan Alexander.  <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>I am a singer, songwriter, entertainer, radio personality, and a lucky father of two living in Nashville, Tennessee. I moved here from Oregon in 2009 where I met the woman who stole my heart and gave me those two little ones we love so much.</span></p>
<p>This IndieGoGo campaign, called ""IT STARTS WITH A SONG"", was inspired after a trip I made in 2015 to the island of Exuma in the Bahamas for a songwriting festival.  I was invited to perform with members of the Standard Club #Nashville and various hit country stars of the Canadian country music scene.   </p>

<br/>
<p>I have been invited back for a second year as a performer and to emcee the festival and wrote a song for this little island.  I have realized through many respected members of the music industry that I have a radio hit on my hands.</p>
<p>Here is how YOU help get this song on the radio...</p>
<p>You may not know what it takes to get a song on the radio, but these days it takes more than just a phone call or handshake. Most songs you hear on the radio are purchased by labels and companies who have deep pockets to go along with the talent behind the song.</p>
<p>It's a 24/7 job that I have been studying for the past 10 years, and as a radio personality and performer I understand the pit falls a songwriter or artist faces when trying to get their song on the radio, tv or even film.</p>
<p>Your help will come in the way of finishing (mixing, mastering, distribution and marketing campaign) the song ""EXUMA"" and the other two songs to be released on the EP.</p>
<p>In short, doing a radio release has been a life long goal and dream added by the possibility to have a hit song and with your generosity and heart, together I believe this will happen in 2016.</p>

<p><b>THE PAST: </b>In the winter of 2011/2012 we embarked on recording our first ever worship album in the woods of North Carolina. What a process and learning experience it was to explore our hearts and the song inside us, all the while shrinking and fitting that into 80 minutes on a CD. It was a long road to the finish line of releasing the album but on December 9th, 2013, what we had dreamed of for some time, we shared with the world. We are so proud of the finished product and the testimonies we continue to hear from it.</p>

At $1200, you will receive a 15 minute private meeting with the musician of your choice.  Contribute just a little more -- $1500 -- and you get to have dinner with the musician of your choice paid for by St. Clair Productions.

  The Impact St. Clair Productions is so excited about having reached its 20th season.  We're the only non-profit producing folk music concerts in Ashland as our main reason for existing.  Giving Ashland residents the opportunity to attend hands-on workshops is our other focus.  St. Clair Productions also is the only producer of folk concerts in Ashland that has lasted 20 years.  Other organizations have come and gone -- we're still here.  
Why have we made it this long?  YOUR FINANCIAL SUPPORT.  And with your financial support, we can continue to bring musicians to Ashland that YOU love and want to come see live.

     Tish Hinojosa  
  Risks & ChallengesLast season, attendance was down.  We ended the season approximately $3000 in the red.  Reserves from previous seasons are keeping us going for now.  We need both your Indiegogo contributions and your attending shows to make it through the next season in order to have a 21st season.  We still have some reserves, but cannot continue operating in the red.      Swami Beyondananda",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Impact

 Your donation will surely impact more people than just one. Sure, I'll be incredibly thankful for the chance to record this new batch of songs and raise the quality of my videos and instruments, but so will others! This is also a donation to the bands I'm lucky enough to play with and possibly make videos for, and all the listeners and viewers that will be able to appreciate the art!! Furthermore, the CD release party will be a fundraiser with all proceeds going to an incredible charity that has yet to be decided! Your help is also a donation to others in your community!! And remember, my last three albums are still available for free download at joelmeeks.bandcamp.com!!

<p>This is the first activity of our partnership with Abrons, and is mainly what we are asking you to support. The program reflects our eclectic interests

classical, medieval chant, and some pop tunes.</p>
<br/><h3>ACCESS ABRONS<br/>

</li>
</ul>Also, through Abrons' offsite programs, we will be visiting public school students learning about classical music. <br/><br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Where does the money go?<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<div>Making our goal of $6000 would mean we could completely cover performer fees, administration fees, and would give us a start on covering artist fees for the classes we will be offering at Abrons beginning in September. The more generous you are, the less often we have to ask for your help. Abrons is a division of the Henry Street Settlement, which has a 100-year history of deeply impacting the Lower East Side community. Supporting us means supporting their much needed work that crosses class, race, and educational boundaries. If that's not enough for you, we created some perks like one does for these campaigns. Since we called our little project Access, our perks are all about accessing our performers and the artistic Mecca that is NYC. <b><br/></b><b><br/></b>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What will this do for the community?<br/>
</h3>Abrons Art Center has working relationships with many schools and community organizations in the LES neighborhood. A great example is the Lower East Side Preparatory High School. As part of Access, we would play music for students in Abrons' existing choral and music appreciation program there. Quite apart from the well documented benefits of consistent exposure to the arts, a project like this can totally alter the course of lives in a good way. And you can be part of it!<br/><br/>A partnership of this type is also tricky. We are agreeing to shoulder much of the responsibility for fundraising in return for space and inclusion in Abrons' class offerings, so we are relying on you to make it happen. But each member of our group brings skills to the table beyond writing and performing music. Highlights of our combined administrative experience includes the establishment of chamber music festivals is Florida and Connecticut, development and funding of a music series with attendant outreach in Pennsylvania, Music Director for DBR and the Mission and so on. The challenges we face are sort of up our collective alley. Plus we are simply excited for the opportunity to work in this way, especially as a new project. <br/><br/>

<h3>Who is this ""Robert Svilpa"" guy, and why should I support this music CD project??</h3> <p></p>

<p>I'm Robert Svilpa - musician, composer and vocalist over here in Snoqualmie Washington, USA. With my good friends Paul Harrington and Mark Parris, we've written, arranged &amp; recorded about 80 minutes worth of original music. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Helping out the project on drums and percussion were featured guests Nick D'Virgilio, Andy Edwards &amp; Zsolt Galantai. Guitar god Alan Morse rounds out the guest list playing lead guitars on the instrumental Mesmerize. The artwork and packaging were created by celebrated artist Ed Unitsky  (<a href=""http://www.edunitsky.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.edunitsky.com</a>) whose resume includes album covers for Unitopia, The Flower Kings and many others.</span></p>

<br/><p></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The completed album was recorded mostly in our home studios between Nov 2007 and May 2009 - but for many reasons instead of releasing it at the time the album was shelved temporarily. </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I ended up burning a measly 35 CD-Rs - 14 which were sent to a small group of loyal supporters and the remaining 21 went out to reviewers &amp; prog radio websites.</span></p>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><i>This original version of the album got rave reviews - some examples of which are below:</i></b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>“A Fine Line Between… is an album that knows no boundaries in what relates to style, as its musical aesthetics never stand still on a particular genre. The music is melodious but in a complex way, always challenging the listener to accompany the directions it surprisingly takes...a great creation of modern progressive music with a deep respect for the legendary vintage bands. A work of art!”<p>- <a href=""http://www.proggnosis.com/PGRelease.asp?RID=30309"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nuno Lourenco, <i>ProgGnosis</i> (Feb 12, 2010)</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“A Fine Line Between ... is neo prog but contemporary... All tunes are very accessible - the songs are very well constructed - Robert Svilpa is a good song writer... neo progressive rock incorporating many traditional prog aspects without sounding old fashioned. Robert Svilpa very nicely combines elements from well known symphonic bands (with) songs that are accessible, without becoming too predictable... DPRP Recommended!!”</p>
<p>- <a href=""http://www.dprp.net/reviews/201009.php#svilpa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EDWIN ROOSJEN, <i>DPRP</i> (Jan 02, 2010)</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>""a fine line between..."" is an excellent new album that caught this reviewer totally by surprise. Progressive rock with elements of neo, symphonic and pop that comes together remarkably well, very listenable &amp; full of melodies... Do yourself a favour &amp; check it out. You will not be disappointed.</p>
<p>- <a href=""http://www.seaoftranquility.org/reviews.php?op=showcontent&amp;id=8394"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Sea of Tranquility</i> (Oct 15, 2009)</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Robert Svilpa and his band have created some great memorable music on A Fine Line Between… a very recommendable to fans of the more melodic side of progressive rock genre. This is an album that could sit side by side new releases by Porcupine Tree, IQ and many others.”</p>
<p>- <a href=""http://www.prognaut.com/reviews/robert-svilpa2.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ron Fuchs, <i>ProgNaut.com</i> (Oct 22, 2009)</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So finally in 2013 I went back to the original recordings resulting in entirely new mixes of the songs incorporating significant improvements in vocal and instrumental performances. To date, feedback from internet radio and reviewers has been very positive - many have remarked on how clean &amp; crisp but ""with balls"" these songs sound today.<br/></p>

I'm Robert Svilpa - musician, composer and vocalist over here in Snoqualmie Washington, USA. With my good friends Paul Harrington and Mark Parris, we've written, arranged & recorded about 80 minutes worth of original music. Helping out the project on drums and percussion were featured guests Nick D'Virgilio, Andy Edwards & Zsolt Galantai. Guitar god Alan Morse rounds out the guest list playing lead guitars on the instrumental Mesmerize. The artwork and packaging were created by celebrated artist Ed Unitsky  (www.edunitsky.com) whose resume includes album covers for Unitopia, The Flower Kings and many others.





The completed album was recorded mostly in our home studios between Nov 2007 and May 2009 - but for many reasons instead of releasing it at the time the album was shelved temporarily. I ended up burning a measly 35 CD-Rs - 14 which were sent to a small group of loyal supporters and the remaining 21 went out to reviewers & prog radio websites.
This original version of the album got rave reviews - some examples of which are below:


“A Fine Line Between… is an album that knows no boundaries in what relates to style, as its musical aesthetics never stand still on a particular genre. The music is melodious but in a complex way, always challenging the listener to accompany the directions it surprisingly takes...a great creation of modern progressive music with a deep respect for the legendary vintage bands. A work of art!”- Nuno Lourenco, ProgGnosis (Feb 12, 2010)


“A Fine Line Between ... is neo prog but contemporary... All tunes are very accessible - the songs are very well constructed - Robert Svilpa is a good song writer... neo progressive rock incorporating many traditional prog aspects without sounding old fashioned. Robert Svilpa very nicely combines elements from well known symphonic bands (with) songs that are accessible, without becoming too predictable... DPRP Recommended!!”
- EDWIN ROOSJEN, DPRP (Jan 02, 2010)


""a fine line between..."" is an excellent new album that caught this reviewer totally by surprise. Progressive rock with elements of neo, symphonic and pop that comes together remarkably well, very listenable & full of melodies... Do yourself a favour & check it out. You will not be disappointed.
- Sea of Tranquility (Oct 15, 2009)


“Robert Svilpa and his band have created some great memorable music on A Fine Line Between… a very recommendable to fans of the more melodic side of progressive rock genre. This is an album that could sit side by side new releases by Porcupine Tree, IQ and many others.”
- Ron Fuchs, ProgNaut.com (Oct 22, 2009)


So finally in 2013 I went back to the original recordings resulting in entirely new mixes of the songs incorporating significant improvements in vocal and instrumental performances. To date, feedback from internet radio and reviewers has been very positive - many have remarked on how clean & crisp but ""with balls"" these songs sound today.
Here's the first ""single"" that internet radio has been playing a lot.

Mirror Mirror - first single from the album

   What We Need & What You Get To be very transparent, this is what I'm looking to fund: 

do a top to bottom mastering of the CD with Steve Turnidge - mastering engineer extraordinaire. Build a ""glass master"" CD to have for proper replication. Package rate of $500 is what's been quoted.

manufacture 1000 full color printed 6 panel CD packages, shrink wrapped and with UPC number. This is quoted at $1350 with shipping.
shooting a promotional video for the album - it will be a self-produced product using rented high definition cameras and my own video production/editing software. I'm estimating between $300 and $500 for the camera rental, incidentals, set pieces and rentals of lighting equipment as needed. (1 day)
I'm asking for a little bit more to cover off any overages in costs, plus promotional postage/shipping to enable setting up inventory with Amazon, CDBaby.com, and distribution networks overseas. I also need to send copies of the CD to music labels to work out distribution deals to both get exposure through the labels marketing networks and also provide credibility for the album itself.  

Of course, if we don't get all the funding we're hoping for I'll be following the task list above and completing each in that exact order - at minimum, reaching a value just over $800 would get us to the point of fully mastered songs and a glass master CD but then likely choosing to have CD-R duplication for short run of 100 exclusively for those who have contributed and are supporting the campaign. It's very important that we take care of you, our trusting supporters.

NOW, if we were to surpass our goal - I have been writing the narrative story that anchors and ties all the songs together with the intention to make it a novella that accompanied the CD. If we exceed the goal and achieve $4500 or more, I'll have the novella professionally printed into booklet form and have them sent along with the CD perks you purchased. I will even sign the booklet with a personal message to each contributor thanking you for your support.
The perks themselves have added items with each level - a full 60 minute CD of classic rock and progressive rock tribute songs. Select songs from the other two remixing projects ""The Sound of Thoughts"" and ""Onion"". Outtakes and rehearsal writing sessions of the songs that made it onto the CD. And I will offer the chance to have a phone or Skype conversation to discuss any music related item you would like to talk about - 30 minutes of one on one time.   The Impact you can make by contributing... Having a proper replicated CD package of the album available gives the band a vehicle that will allow us to play more higher profile shows. Being able to play some of the key progressive rock festivals and events is invaluable but that opportunity can only be available if the band has CDs available - the credibility gains are immense.
Having success with this album then opens up opportunity for new music. As with everything in life, success breeds success - bands such as Marillion and Frost* have been able to ride grass roots fan support into long term success and a steady stream of new material, so this cannot be understated.
    Risks & Challenges From the perspective of the recordings, this project has very low risk 


marketing and publicity has been handled to date by myself (Rob) and people around us. Getting more airtime for the music shouldn't be difficult as I have been networking considerably to get it out there. Driving traffic to the website and all the distribution networks is the goal and all are on board with that task. 

Artwork & packaging is done:

Where risk exists is only in developing and legitimizing a working relationship with a music label who is supportive of the genre and in particular the band. With new music coming out and the reviews being good, we believe it will fit into the same sweet spot that artists like Steven Wilson, Gaspacho (the Norwegian band), IQ, Haken and Neal Morse / Spock's Beard sit right now.

    Other Ways You Can Help You personally may not be in a situation to contribute. That's ok - if you can help in the following way, it would be spectacular:  Help get the word out about this project and encourage people to contribute to my campaign.
Share the music, and ask me to do an interview or a Q & A session - there's a lot of background in terms of how everyone involved became involved with the CD Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!
Most of all - if you're on Facebook, Twitter, etc... share and rebroadcast anything to do with the project and future projects!    Thanks to all and much love to you going forward!!",4.0,1,"1 Campaign

</div><p></p><h3>Summary</h3><p>My name is Ariel Levine.  Many of you may know me as lead singer and guitarist from the New York band, <a href=""http://www.kindergartennyc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/kindergarten/id263840456"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">KiNDERGARTEN</a>.  We were active through the 2000's and produced two albums together.  About 5 years ago, I was itching to step out of my comfort zone and leave my hometown of New York City.  I ended up in San Diego, where I've been making a name for myself as a producer, engineer and musician, here and in Los Angeles.  I've been lucky to work with some great artists, and have discovered new methods of finding happiness; namely the ocean.  But I'm an artist and a songwriter at heart.  Those sleepless nights are creeping back into my life, and new music is pouring out of me at a rate I can barely keep up with.  With that, I welcome you to the production of my debut solo album, ""<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/ariellevine/sets/let-the-machine-get-it-works-in-progress-working-titles"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LET THE MACHINE GET IT</a>"".</p><p>This is meant to be a good ol' fashioned, full length, rock n' roll LP.  It has a story arc, it has recurring musical themes and it's meant to be listened to from start to finish.  That's not to say that each song can't stand out on it's own, I believe they do.  But I've always loved the art of the 40-45 minute album, I believe they're still relevant and it's the medium in which I work best. </p>The songs I wrote with KiNDERGARTEN focused on finding humor in mankind's darkest moments, dystopian futures, cities and skylines.  However, this time I turn my candor inward, breaking down a wall I've kept up all these years. ""<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/ariellevine/sets/let-the-machine-get-it-works-in-progress-working-titles"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LET THE MACHINE GET IT</a>"" is the first time where I'm writing about myself, my own personal experiences with love, loss, fear, change and obsession in a traveling story arc that surrounds the album. ""LTMGI"" is set to be the most personally revealing collection of songs in my career to date. <div>
<br/><p></p>
<h3><b>What I Need</b></h3>
<p>The drums have already been recorded at <a href=""http://rarefiedrecording.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rarefied Recording</a> in San Diego, CA.  Now I just need to do the rest!</p>
<p>My asking budget will give me the complete start-to-finish freedom I need to create exactly what I set out to create, without compromises.  I'd love for ""LTMGI"" to be done at a professional studio.  Rarefied Recording has everything I need to make this sound as good as possible. </p>
<p>Besides the recording process, my budget also includes:</p>
<p>-Hiring additional musicians when needed</p>
<p>-Mixing</p>
<p>-Mastering </p>
<p>-Photo shoot, packaging and design of the album cover (see rough sketch below)</p>
<p>-Pressing and distributing vinyl</p>
<p>-Publicist and promotion  </p>

<div>
<h3><br/></h3>

</div></div>","SummaryMy name is Ariel Levine.  Many of you may know me as lead singer and guitarist from the New York band, KiNDERGARTEN.  We were active through the 2000's and produced two albums together.  About 5 years ago, I was itching to step out of my comfort zone and leave my hometown of New York City.  I ended up in San Diego, where I've been making a name for myself as a producer, engineer and musician, here and in Los Angeles.  I've been lucky to work with some great artists, and have discovered new methods of finding happiness; namely the ocean.  But I'm an artist and a songwriter at heart.  Those sleepless nights are creeping back into my life, and new music is pouring out of me at a rate I can barely keep up with.  With that, I welcome you to the production of my debut solo album, ""LET THE MACHINE GET IT"".This is meant to be a good ol' fashioned, full length, rock n' roll LP.  It has a story arc, it has recurring musical themes and it's meant to be listened to from start to finish.  That's not to say that each song can't stand out on it's own, I believe they do.  But I've always loved the art of the 40-45 minute album, I believe they're still relevant and it's the medium in which I work best. The songs I wrote with KiNDERGARTEN focused on finding humor in mankind's darkest moments, dystopian futures, cities and skylines.  However, this time I turn my candor inward, breaking down a wall I've kept up all these years. ""LET THE MACHINE GET IT"" is the first time where I'm writing about myself, my own personal experiences with love, loss, fear, change and obsession in a traveling story arc that surrounds the album. ""LTMGI"" is set to be the most personally revealing collection of songs in my career to date. 

What I Need
The drums have already been recorded at Rarefied Recording in San Diego, CA.  Now I just need to do the rest!
My asking budget will give me the complete start-to-finish freedom I need to create exactly what I set out to create, without compromises.  I'd love for ""LTMGI"" to be done at a professional studio.  Rarefied Recording has everything I need to make this sound as good as possible. 
Besides the recording process, my budget also includes:
-Hiring additional musicians when needed
-Mixing
-Mastering 
-Photo shoot, packaging and design of the album cover (see rough sketch below)
-Pressing and distributing vinyl
-Publicist and promotion

The Impact
I believe in my heart I have something really good here.  I believe I have songs that everyone can find a spot to relate to.  I believe the art of the album is not dead.  This is not the only album I plan to make.  This is a starting point to what I hope is a long and prolific career as a solo artist.  The cornerstone to a full body of work to come.
If this can help boost my reputation and career, I will continue to write songs from my heart.  Songs that explore the human condition, the future, the world inside our heads and outside our eyes.  I will continue to make sounds that draw upon decades of influences, yet take them on new twists and turns.

</h3> <p>Not since the early days of Motown has a company attempted to craft and mold young artist into full fledged musical brands that can create a fresh impact on the music landscape. ""ON FUEGO PRODUCTIONS"" wants to do just that. It's time to reestablish quality over quantity, style and substance, relevance and pride. Today's music is missing it's soul and we don't mean ""soul music"", we mean the ""soul"" of music. The ability to connect with the listener, to create those moments that take you back to a special time &amp; place or that connection to love or a love lost... to create classic songs that will live on 20 years from now. Eddie Cabrera, Paul Beatty, Shawn Grate and Frank Desplantes have over 50 years of combined music experience. ""ON FUEGO PRODUCTIONS"". </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Gordon Vaughn, and I'm originally from Los Angeles now living in Atlanta Georgia. I grew up in a small suburb of LA called Sylmar, in San Fernando Valley. I was a misunderstood child turned choir geek in High School and started writing my own music with a friend while a senior. I joined a band my 2nd year in college and we named ourselves Cool For August. 2 years later, we were in the middle of a bidding war with 5 major labels wanting to sign us. Our first single hit top 15 on radio before a new CEO was hired at WB Records, &amp; 2/3 of the entire label was fired. Needless to say everything came to a halt for us. I then became a salaried songwriter for Hitco Music @ $30,000 a year for 2 years, and had many song placements on TV shows, sporting events, etc, but not enough to see good residual checks. I've spent the past 10 years working regular jobs &amp; raising 2 beautiful sons, &amp; at the same time spending these last 4 years preparing for this moment to finally do what I was born to do. And the great part is I don't have to rely on big labels and expensive studio recordings. However, I do need money to support what's needed for me to succeed.  I've worked so very hard these past 4 years, sacrificing so much to make this happen. Please help me see this through! I know the results will be monumental!</p>
<h3>What we need &amp; what you get</h3>
</div><div><p>Much of our expenses such as rehearsal studios, equipment, new website design, and close to 1/2 of the album recording has already been completed. I need roughly $30,000 to complete my goals, which include finishing the recording, mixing, and mastering of the album. Your funds will also be used to pay for 50% of our professional video costs, hire a social media marketing expert for 6 months to expand our fan base and visibility, design and purchase our first order of band merchandise, and allow us to lease a touring vehicle with a trailer until we start making money on the road. Our perks will include everything from digital downloads, autographed CD's, band t-shirts, signed handwritten lyric sheets, free guest list attendance to our live shows, backstage passes, personal performances at your home or place of choice, and more! We are seasoned artists, musicians, and performers, so the sky's the limit!!</p></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will allow us to get the best songs I've ever written, to the public. Your contribution will also allow my band, 1500 Pieces to take our performance to almost every state in the nation, &amp; hopefully to Australia, New Zealand, &amp; Europe! My songs have been featured on MTV, Conan OBrien, Hey Hey It's Saturday, and have been played on multiple radio stations in the US and around the world! I also have contacts with many people in the business, including pros and artists that you've heard of, &amp; they're watching to see how 1500 Pieces puts this together. Your contributions will accomplish more than anyone could possibly imagine! We have a very real shot at the top, and everything that comes with it: TV shows, radio, and tours in the US &amp; abroad! Go to <a href=""http://www.1500pieces.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.1500pieces.com</a> and listen to 3 of the album tracks completed so far. Hopefully they will speak for me, but your donations are the key to their success!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge facing 1500 Pieces is whether a group of older guys can succeed in a business that has traditionally been dominated by young artists. My goal is huge. I want to be on stage with The Killers, Portugal The Man, &amp; Daft Punk. I want my songs to be played in heavy rotation on Sirius XM, Spotify &amp; Pandora. I want to have over a million followers on Instagram, and want to write songs for movie soundtracks. My musical desires haven't changed since I was very young. This goal is a longshot for anyone's pursuit, but I know what it's gonna take to accomplish it: I have to keep an open mind, enjoy every moment of the journey, make many friends along the way that share the same vision, seek advice from people in the business that know more than myself, support the people that surround me including the ones that don't support me, and continue to write strong, melodic, hooky, pop sensible songs. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some of you may not be able to support or donate financially, but there are so many other ways you can show your support! I frequently keep in contact with my friends on fans, and enjoy showing them love when they show their support by getting the word out on our behalf! This includes sharing my posts, suggesting they follow 1500 Pieces on Instagram &amp; Facebook, telling their friends to listen and download our music. Being a success in music today takes the effort of thousands rallying around music and musicians they like and respect. Please listen to my music: <a href=""http://www.1500pieces.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.1500pieces.com</a>. If you believe in the music, let your feelings be known on social media. Your participation, no matter how big or small, will always make a significant impact!!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Groove. Legacy. Impact.</h3>
<p>The TOaG Quartet is an Oakland-based assembly of instrumentalists inspired by the many lineages of improvisation and groove. Striving to be honest to who we are, where we have been, and where we hope to go, we pay homage to the work of our elders - who laid the groundwork upon which we stand - while aspiring to spark the mind with truth, and move the spirit with groove. Alongside the tireless service of community music educators, TOaG also works to support arts education by curating jazz clinics for young students, creating a positive space for musical exchange between professionals and pupils.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557531818/zraodo0oda8pmnhpzyda.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

</h3>
<p><font>Our music, described as ""raw but refined,"" is i</font>nspired by the many lineages of improvisation and groove.  Charting a course of all original compositions with dirge-like ballads, greasy grooves, lush soundscapes, sizzling up-tempo swingers, and narrative interludes, our music is a sonic adventure that will take you places. We intend for our music to be a thread in the fabric of creative resistance that both honors and continues the fight for a better world: one that is just, green, safe, and joy-filled for all peoples.  <br/> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We support music educators.</span></h3>
<p>The TOaG Quartet also supports arts education by curating jazz clinics for young students, which create a positive space for musical exchange between professionals and pupils. In partnership with Oakland High School Music department head David Byrd, we successfully finished our first complete year of the program. The clinics culminated in a 10-hour studio session for the student jazz band at Airship Laboratories, where they recorded a selection of their repertoire for their future use.<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557200371/ujlina5easlupr3psvl5.jpg"" src=""""/></span></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/>We are throwing an album release party!</h3>
<p>We are gonna kick off the release of this record with a special evening concert in East Bay, CA on July 25th 2019. The show will begin with a opening set by our Oakland High School jazz students, who will be showcasing their own band and music. After a brief intermission, The TOaG Quartet will play two sets of our music, celebrating the album as well as brand new compositions never before heard in public. You don't want to miss this night of entertainment!</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/>But we can't do all this without your support.</h3>
<p>We've done so much work to get to this point, but the fact is that the large front end costs of launching a project like ours make it impossible to do on our own. We know we have to invest now in order to secure a sustainable future for our work, but we just don't have the capital to do all the things that are necessary.</p>
<p>Running a successful band means managing a consistent stream of content that can be utilized to market our services for bigger and bigger opportunities. In our case, the success of this record will not only help us elevate our booking capabilities, but will enable us to expand our outreach efforts in support of music education programs that need mentors and supplemental programming. Every single show we play will help us raise funds for our educational partners. That means the more we book, the more we give back. <br/><br/>Here is what the funds raised will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixing the record</li>
<li>Mastering the record</li>
<li>Manufacturing double CDs</li>
<li>Manufacturing double Vinyls</li>
<li>Manufacturing T-shirts</li>
<li>Manufacturing promotional materials</li>
<li>Producing two videos</li>
<li>Promoting the record both nationally and internationally</li>
<li>Marketing our services to schools and institutions</li>
<li>Paying venue booking fees for the release show</li>
<li>Renting sound and lighting equipment for the release show</li>
<li>Paying our hardworking musicians a living wage for their time</li>
</ul>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/>So many ways to say THANK YOU!</h3>
<p>We've put together an incredible variety of perks to thank you for your generous donation to our cause, ranging from digital to physical to experiential. While all are designed to please, we did want to highlight a few. </p>
<p>1. <strong>Sponsored OUSD Student Ticket</strong><br/>We know that not everyone is going to be able to make it to our release show. But, that doesn't mean you cant support us AND make a meaningful difference in a young artist's life. I'm sure we can all remember how hard it was to see all the live music we wanted to go to when we were under 18 - not to mention our general lack of funds at that an age. That's why we're offering sponsored tickets to our release show for Oakland student musicians. Not only will they have an opportunity to come see our band put on a kick-ass show at no cost to them, they will also get to see their peers perform in a professional environment. How cool is that?!</p>
<p>2. <strong>A Visual Masterpiece</strong><br/>Have you checked out our graphics yet? They are unique visual art, painstakingly crafted by the incredible being that is Johnny Jones. A kind soul with a sharp eye, he is a top-shelf graphic designer with decades in the industry. Thanks to him, the representation of our musical organization in visual form has taken on a life of its own. And we just can't say enough about the album cover art. . . it's stunning. Get the limited edition double vinyl to appreciate his beautiful and incredibly detailed art at it's best, but the digital still and the CD design look freakin' awesome, too.  </p>
<p>3. <strong>A Private Concert Exclusive</strong><br/>For our highest giving levels, we will present an entire evening of excitement, entertainment, and groove, tailored to fit your particular taste. This private performance at your home or work will be an up-close and personal experience like no other.

<p>4. <strong>A Hi-Fi Vinyl Record That Sounds Great to Professional Audiophiles</strong><br/>For you audiophiles out there, two industry heavies are absolutely hyped on how good this record is gonna sound: Jessica Thompson and Neil Godbole. Jessica, our mastering engineer, is a top-shelf mastering engineer/audio preservationist who serves as the secretary of the San Francisco Chapter of the Recording Academy, sits on the board of the San Francisco Chapter of the Audio Engineering Society, and teaches a course on the history of music production at SAE/Expression College.  <br/><br/>Neil, our recording and mixing engineer, is the owner of one of the premier studios in Northern California - Airship Laboratories. As a heavy in the industry who consistently works with world class talent, Neil knew what he was getting into this time around - a hard hitting band, feet away from each other, with no isolation, and a live audience. No big deal for a pro like him. From the design of the room through the hand-off to Jessica, Neil has had his hand on every single stem of audio we produced. </p>

</div></div>","Groove. Legacy. Impact.
The TOaG Quartet is an Oakland-based assembly of instrumentalists inspired by the many lineages of improvisation and groove. Striving to be honest to who we are, where we have been, and where we hope to go, we pay homage to the work of our elders - who laid the groundwork upon which we stand - while aspiring to spark the mind with truth, and move the spirit with groove. Alongside the tireless service of community music educators, TOaG also works to support arts education by curating jazz clinics for young students, creating a positive space for musical exchange between professionals and pupils.

We produce furious jazz.

Our music, described as ""raw but refined,"" is inspired by the many lineages of improvisation and groove.  Charting a course of all original compositions with dirge-like ballads, greasy grooves, lush soundscapes, sizzling up-tempo swingers, and narrative interludes, our music is a sonic adventure that will take you places. We intend for our music to be a thread in the fabric of creative resistance that both honors and continues the fight for a better world: one that is just, green, safe, and joy-filled for all peoples.   
We support music educators.
The TOaG Quartet also supports arts education by curating jazz clinics for young students, which create a positive space for musical exchange between professionals and pupils. In partnership with Oakland High School Music department head David Byrd, we successfully finished our first complete year of the program. The clinics culminated in a 10-hour studio session for the student jazz band at Airship Laboratories, where they recorded a selection of their repertoire for their future use.

We are preparing to launch a live studio album.

Recorded live at the legendary Airship Laboratories with the audience in the studio with us, our upcoming double album is an impassioned follow-up to our first record Grey and Green.  With all the grit and grace of a live show, each tune will play seamlessly from track to track - including two suites that were performed as continuous compositions at the recording session. We are also very proud to have assembled a dream team of local creatives to handle our production needs - with Neil Godbole as recording and mixing engineer, Jessica Thompson as mastering engineer, Nino Fernandez as videographer, and Johnny Jones of COMA as our graphic designer. Our collective souls have been poured into this record - and now we want to share it with the world. 

We are throwing an album release party!
We are gonna kick off the release of this record with a special evening concert in East Bay, CA on July 25th 2019. The show will begin with a opening set by our Oakland High School jazz students, who will be showcasing their own band and music. After a brief intermission, The TOaG Quartet will play two sets of our music, celebrating the album as well as brand new compositions never before heard in public. You don't want to miss this night of entertainment!


But we can't do all this without your support.
We've done so much work to get to this point, but the fact is that the large front end costs of launching a project like ours make it impossible to do on our own. We know we have to invest now in order to secure a sustainable future for our work, but we just don't have the capital to do all the things that are necessary.
Running a successful band means managing a consistent stream of content that can be utilized to market our services for bigger and bigger opportunities. In our case, the success of this record will not only help us elevate our booking capabilities, but will enable us to expand our outreach efforts in support of music education programs that need mentors and supplemental programming. Every single show we play will help us raise funds for our educational partners. That means the more we book, the more we give back. Here is what the funds raised will pay for:

Mixing the record
Mastering the record
Manufacturing double CDs
Manufacturing double Vinyls
Manufacturing T-shirts
Manufacturing promotional materials
Producing two videos
Promoting the record both nationally and internationally
Marketing our services to schools and institutions
Paying venue booking fees for the release show
Renting sound and lighting equipment for the release show
Paying our hardworking musicians a living wage for their time



So many ways to say THANK YOU!
We've put together an incredible variety of perks to thank you for your generous donation to our cause, ranging from digital to physical to experiential. While all are designed to please, we did want to highlight a few. 
1. Sponsored OUSD Student TicketWe know that not everyone is going to be able to make it to our release show. But, that doesn't mean you cant support us AND make a meaningful difference in a young artist's life. I'm sure we can all remember how hard it was to see all the live music we wanted to go to when we were under 18 - not to mention our general lack of funds at that an age. That's why we're offering sponsored tickets to our release show for Oakland student musicians. Not only will they have an opportunity to come see our band put on a kick-ass show at no cost to them, they will also get to see their peers perform in a professional environment. How cool is that?!
2. A Visual MasterpieceHave you checked out our graphics yet? They are unique visual art, painstakingly crafted by the incredible being that is Johnny Jones. A kind soul with a sharp eye, he is a top-shelf graphic designer with decades in the industry. Thanks to him, the representation of our musical organization in visual form has taken on a life of its own. And we just can't say enough about the album cover art. . . it's stunning. Get the limited edition double vinyl to appreciate his beautiful and incredibly detailed art at it's best, but the digital still and the CD design look freakin' awesome, too.  
3. A Private Concert ExclusiveFor our highest giving levels, we will present an entire evening of excitement, entertainment, and groove, tailored to fit your particular taste. This private performance at your home or work will be an up-close and personal experience like no other. You'll have the opportunity to meet members of the band, get a behind the scenes look at our compositions and process, check out our high-end gear, and hear some of our unreleased music! From conception to concert, we'll work with you to make sure your evening with The TOaG Quartet is absolutely extraordinary. 
4. A Hi-Fi Vinyl Record That Sounds Great to Professional AudiophilesFor you audiophiles out there, two industry heavies are absolutely hyped on how good this record is gonna sound: Jessica Thompson and Neil Godbole. Jessica, our mastering engineer, is a top-shelf mastering engineer/audio preservationist who serves as the secretary of the San Francisco Chapter of the Recording Academy, sits on the board of the San Francisco Chapter of the Audio Engineering Society, and teaches a course on the history of music production at SAE/Expression College.  Neil, our recording and mixing engineer, is the owner of one of the premier studios in Northern California - Airship Laboratories.

No big deal for a pro like him. From the design of the room through the hand-off to Jessica, Neil has had his hand on every single stem of audio we produced. 



No one is gonna help except you, and us.
Let's be real: it's no easy task to manage a band, fundraise, build curricula, book shows, and development new material - especially in a society that has consistently under-supported art. Whether we are talking about the seemingly endless cutbacks to arts programming in our schools, especially in those that serve our communities of color, or the colossal depression of creative industry wages that has working artists all over the country hustling for ""exposure and food"" gigs, we've chosen a rather difficult path.

<h3>Dream Delayed</h3>
<p>Have you ever had a dream delayed? Has it ever been for the best of reasons? Rob's daughter Margaux Ivy was born days apart from his last release in September of 2017, and instead of hitting the road in support of the recording, Rob took a break to be with his new baby.  While she is Mary Poppins practically perfect in every way, caring for her slowed down the band's momentum.  Rob and crew are now ready to return to the studio and get back into the fray of making original music full time.</p>
<p>The songs are ready, full of passion and poetry.  The band is tight and ready to go. We have a top notch producer lined up and time booked at one of the finest studios in Nashville Tennessee.  All we need is your support. </p>
<h3>Dream Renewed</h3>
<p>Proceeds from this campaign will go towards a day of recording at Sound Emporium Studios and the subsequent costs of mixing and mastering what we lay down.  Our Grammy award winning friends <a href=""https://buckleymiller.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Buckley Miller</a> will be in charge of tracking and Andy Selby will handle the mixing.  The remaining proceeds will go towards making a short run of CDs and merch to share with you, loyal contributors! </p>
<h3>What We Need, The Breakdown</h3>
<p>One day of tracking at Sound Emporium: $1850</p>
<p>Mixing and post production on 6 songs: $900</p>
<p>Mastering: $650</p>
<p>Total: $3400</p>
<p>Everything over that will go towards a short CD run and all the goodies you can find below!</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Anyone who contributes can get their name on our website thank you page (or opt out if you're off the grid...)  We have:</p>
<p>Official Rob Higginbotham Guitar Picks</p>
<p>Pre-release digital downloads</p>
<p>Signed posters</p>
<p>CDs</p>
<p>Digital Companion Liner Notes</p>
<p>Shirts, Sweatshirts, private lessons, a spot in our next music video, an invite to the actual recording (July 13 2019), house concerts and more!</p>
<h3>What It Means</h3>
<p>We are so grateful to all of you who helped us meet our goal in 2017.  Our first EP recording surpassed all our expectations.  We learned a ton about using a new release to gain exposure and open new markets, and this time around we're going to hit the ground running with your help.  </p>
<p>The songs on this new EP are passionate works from Rob's heart, and need to make it out into the light.  ""Margaux"" and ""Ivy Bee"" were both inspired by his little one, and the other songs spin tales and create worlds of beauty and longing.  Help us bring that into the world.</p>
<h3>Make It Or Break It</h3>
<p>We know there are a million things to invest in, a million causes to get behind.  Why pick this one?</p>
<p>Rob has always been a dreamer.  His goal has never been to make money, but to follow his heart.  His genre defying, exceptionally eclectic songs certainly prove that.  Instead of chasing the dog's tail of the popular to make a buck, Rob finds his muse elsewhere:  in family, the heartache of friends, the longing of the soul, even in a perfect cup of black coffee.  You can help make this dream a reality and bring some heartfelt music into a world that could honestly use some more.</p>
<p>This music resonates with so many that hear it.  Rob and the Mysterious Undertones have been playing out constantly to share these songs with all who will listen.  Help us reach more.</p>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can tip the band with $5 and get a thank you, or throw us $1500 and get a free pass to everything we do for the next year and a boatload of perks.  Or if you're as broke as we are, you can:</p>

<h3>Greetings!</h3>
<p>Hello there! We are a Texas-grown, independent band known as Televangelist. As we started planning the ground work for 2017, we had no idea how many changes and challenges we would face--it's been an exciting time. New members, a bigger show, our first west coast tour, and a new album on the horizon have certainly kept us busy even in the planning stages. </p>
<p>To keep up with our expanding show, we come to an unavoidable conclusion: <strong>WE NEED A VAN. </strong>Our first tour effort saw us cramming into Kyle's 2013 Honda Fit. With an extra member and more equipment, this is no longer a possibility. </p>
<p>This is why we need your help. With the tour right around the corner, we are still around $3750 short of getting a van that meets our requirements. Getting a vehicle like this will help us to tour longer and more often!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to be able to buy a suitable van (enough space, secure, safe) for the tour. We decided that, to keep the price down, we would get a used van. $3750 seemed like enough to do this. If there is ANY excess money, it will go to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage light</li>
<li>Music video efforts</li>
<li>Recording our next album</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to note that any money we raise with this album will remain with the band; that is to say that whatever YOU help us raise will directly impact what we can do for the upcoming year. We have big plans (international touring, music video series), so getting the van out of the way and paid for will help us reach our more lofty goals.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We realize that this campaign is last minute--truth be told, we weren't really in a position to ask for something like this until this week! This goal is the absolute lowest amount we feel will the tour van expenses. If we do not make this goal, we will still honor any perks that are met. If we exceed our goal, we will publish a statement so that you will know where all the money is going. If our goal is met, expect to see a shiny, new (used) van in a city near you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that you may not be able to personally help with this effort. If you don't have money to spare, please take a second to share our event. We are entirely funded by our fan base, so the more people that includes the more likely we are to be able to keep it going. </p>
<p>If something about the Indiegogo platform turns you off, a lot of this merch is accessible via our bandcamp wesbite televangelist.bandcamp.com.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time! We'll see you on the road!!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As an artist, AMET Ricky's style captivates all audiences. His lyrical word play is enticing.

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

As of now he has been nominated for two awards, one for best Indie Female Hip Hop at the Women In Charge Awards held in Atlanta,GA, and also for the Young Artist Spotlight Award at the SCM Awards held in Memphis, TN. AMET Ricky's creativity leaves listeners wondering if he will take the crown as the true new prince of Hip Hop.

What We Need & What You Get
AMET Ricky has been given an opportunity, thanks to MP3Waxx, to make His-Story as the first transgender male artist to ever take over major radio platforms. Along with this opportunity, all contributions to this campaign will go to the marketing of ""LxVE"" both on social media and on major platforms.

The Impact
AMET Ricky wants to thank everyone in advance for their support of this campaign. As a young artist, he has faced many challenges both personally and in his career. Being a part of the LGBT as well as the hip-hop community is not ordinary, and he appreciates everyone who is helping him break down the barriers to show that it doesn't matter who you are or how you identify, what matters is the music.

Other Ways You Can Help
Along with donations, you can help this cause by supporting AMET Ricky's music, as well as sharing the campaign with others. Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h2><p><strong>Q: Who is the Physics of Guitar Playing <i>Foundations</i> <i>Course</i> for?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A: Okay, we’re biased, but we can’t think of many guitar players who wouldn’t benefit, from near-beginner to advanced to pro. If you’re a player who knows everything about technique, you might pass—but if you’re always seeking new info this course is for you. Hey, playing really great is everything you thought it'd be. Here’s your ticket to all of that.</p><p><strong>Q: How much do I have to practice?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A: More important than practice quantity is practice <i>quality and consistency</i>. Many players make headway with a 1/2  hour of great practice five days a week; most can’t excel with three hours of sloppy, occasional practice. Don’t skip more than a few days at a time. Always seek to improve, not just practice your mistakes.</p><p><strong>Q: Is this about the “secrets” of classical guitar technique?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A: To some extent, yes. That said, the 17 AXioms™ of our Foundations Course are based on nuggets of teaching wisdom that cross style lines and are universal, designed to help jazz, rock, blues, acoustic, and players of all styles play better. </p><p><strong>Q: I see you have different options for the Foundations Course. Which version should I get?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A: This depends on whether you're a beginner or intermediate-advanced (our courses are labeled for either beginner or intermediate and above), how fast you want to learn, your budget. Your choices include the Foundations Course “Chalk Talk” videos with animation and workbook, the Foundations Course Supplemental Video, the 10-Minute Foundations Workout Course, and all of the above with online tutoring.</p><p><strong>Q: I think great playing is all about talent—so how can this course help?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A: Well, first off, we strongly disagree. Yes, there are genuine talents—Hendrix, for instance—to whom, perhaps, guitar playing came easily (though we’re pretty sure he practiced—a lot and with great precision). They are one in a million. Still, most of the best guitarists worked at it; just ask them.</p><p><strong>Q: How tough is the material to understand?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A: The material is understandable to most, even very young players who have someone to help them. Some of the concepts involve seemingly simple ideas, such as slow practice. Some involve more complex ideas, such as understanding systems and motion. But with a little patience, nearly anyone can master the material.</p><p><strong>Q: How do I get the most out of this course?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:21.0pt;"">A: First: Like the karate student who should do what the instructor says at first, POG students do best when taking each AXiom™ to heart before trying to tweak it.</p><p style=""margin-left:21.0pt;"">Second: While you don’t have to practice hours a day, consistent practice while applying the technical lessons will optimize your results.</p><p style=""margin-left:21.0pt;"">Third: It’s best to stick with one AXiom™ at a time, applying the technique until it is a habit before jumping from one AXiom™ to another. (Note that we include a practice guide for getting the most out of the course.)</p><h3>Who Should Get the Course?</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505973663/y5ctpjyggtf2moakbpe1.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Are you intellectually curious? Do you wonder exactly how to make your fingers work better? Do enjoy studying and practicing? Does the idea of a scientific approach to playing appeal to you?

While we believe that nearly any player can benefit, we would rather turn away those not the best fit.

""Ninety percent of this game is mental. The other half is physical.""                                     -Baseball great Yogi BerraIn development for over a decade at the Physics of Guitar Playing® Institute, our course addresses a real problem in the world of guitar teaching and playing: Most guitar players are only taught WHAT to PLAY, not HOW to PLAY WELL. Students memorize songs, scales, and chords without any real idea of how to play with the effortlessness and precision of a pro.The Foundations Course—based on technical wisdom from classical and flamenco guitar teachers but designed for non-classical players—gives guitar players of all styles the tools they need to play great. With “Chalk Talk” classroom-style videos, workbooks, and tutoring, frustrated students can finally understand why they don’t play expertly, why others do, and how to hone their technique until they can play great guitar too.Join us as we set out to create better guitar players the world over and make guitar more fun to play—and listen to. Play Guitar, But Still Can't Shred?You want to make clean chord changes and shred through scales and songs. But despite lessons, books, and videos, you still can’t blaze. You're stuck. You suck. It’s not your fault!Going Nowhere? 
Are you struggling to play great?
Can’t make fast, clean changes?
Do your hands feel clumsy, unable to do what you want them to do?
Ready to jump into the big leagues but you just can’t seem to push your playing to that pro level?
Getting No Help?
Bought stacks of books filled with scales or songs, but they didn’t teach how to play great, just what to play?
Signed up for online courses or bought DVD’s and still didn’t learn how to play?
Asked teachers how they play as well as they do, but found they can’t explain it?

There's A Reason You Can't Play Great:
You’ve only Learned WHAT to PLAY, Not HOW TO PLAY GREAT!Scale charts like this are for memorizing.They don’t show you how to get your fingers to play at a professional level. You may have memorized chords, scales, and songs, but that’s not enough.The sad secret is most teachers don’t “teach” how to play well—they just walk students through what to play, never cracking the question of how. See the difference?There are underlying principles of why some people are great players, and once you understand them, you can apply them to your own playing—and shred. No “blues” or “rock” chords and licks. Just how to play great—because that’s what you need.Just Learning What to Play Won't Cut ItIt Won’t Happen By Learning More Scales & Chords.Learning scales and chords is simple memorization, and you can spend $100 on books and videos to memorize for 10 years. What you need is someone to show you how to play great. That’s what we do!Playing Guitar is a Gas When You Can Play GreatRemember when, as a kid, you’d lie in bed, wishing you could wake up and play like a guitar god? Now, it can happen! It will take some time, some discipline, some study. But it won’t take forever. In as few as three months, you’ll see a huge improvement, and in 12 months, you can double your skills. This time next year, you can be playing at the pro level. Ready to Play Like a Pro?What if you could double your playing skills in the next 12 months? What if this time next year you could have the kind of chops and speed you’ve always wanted? Finally, You Can Play GreatWhen You Learn the SECRETS Behind How to Play Guitar.Many of these secrets of technique come from the world of classical and flamenco guitar. Top classical guitarists don’t just know how to play incredibly difficult music—they are taught how to play. And you can be taught how to play your style of guitar—and do it with ease, precision, and speed.Classical Guitarists Often Perform Music That Seems Impossible to PlayThey’ve been taught to understand the mechanics—the physics—of playing (how their hands and fingers work best), how to think like a musician, and they’ve learned to practice in a way that produces a high level of playing. In short, they’ve learned the Physics of Guitar Playing®. These 17 concepts—aka AXioms™—can help make the most challenging passages easy, and our expert instructors have adapted these for rock, blues, jazz, and all non-classical players.Double your chops in 12 months: POG = YG^2(Physics of Guitar Playing® = Your Guitar Skills, Squared)By understanding concepts of physiology, straight-line movement vs. curved-line movement, weight, mental tension, practice efficiency, the psychology of error-free playing, “muscle memory,” and more—all presented in an easy-to-understand format.The Physics of Guitar Playing® Foundations Course Will Shift Your Playing Into OverdriveNow you can learn these principles and techniques with our 17 video AXioms™. You’ll understand how to play great, and you’ll make playing look as easy as brushing your teeth. This course is about how to rock in any style, rock, blues, jazz, or shred. And good technique, based upon reducing your workload and using the correct mechanics, can reduce common player injuries.No - We're Not Going to Teach You ""Classical Guitar""That's not the point. Whatever your style, you'll learn to think, practice, and play like a pro.Here's Just Some of What You'll Learn About:
How your hands naturally function in everyday life — and why they fail you on guitar.
The left hand “approach” that seems to make your fingers longer.
How to eliminate the excessive muscle tension in your hands that robs you of the ability of change chords cleanly and play fast scales.
How you can “work” at making playing easy and completely effortless.
Why gravity is a guitarist’s best friend.
Why ”slow-mo” practice creates flawless, professional-level guitar playing.
What guitarists can learn from race car drivers about going fast.
The difference between “linear” and “curvilinear” motion and the astonishing effect this difference makes when shifting across the fingerboard. (It’s easy to learn!)
Why the way you change chords now is so inefficient that chord changes are far tougher than they should be.
Why you don’t even need your guitar to learn a new piece of music.
Why your upper knuckles are the key to blazing finger-picking.
Upstage Friends. Sit In On Elite Jam Sessions. Form a Band. Absolutely Rule At the Guitar Store. Because now you’ll be able to make clean, fast chord changes. You’ll shred scales at the speed of light. Now, finally, you can take everything to the pro level, whether you want to get famous, front a local band, or just show off. Answers to Your Questions
Q: Who is the Physics of Guitar Playing Foundations Course for?A: Okay, we’re biased, but we can’t think of many guitar players who wouldn’t benefit, from near-beginner to advanced to pro. If you’re a player who knows everything about technique, you might pass—but if you’re always seeking new info this course is for you. Hey, playing really great is everything you thought it'd be. Here’s your ticket to all of that.Q: How much do I have to practice?A: More important than practice quantity is practice quality and consistency. Many players make headway with a 1/2  hour of great practice five days a week; most can’t excel with three hours of sloppy, occasional practice. Don’t skip more than a few days at a time. Always seek to improve, not just practice your mistakes.Q: Is this about the “secrets” of classical guitar technique?A: To some extent, yes. That said, the 17 AXioms™ of our Foundations Course are based on nuggets of teaching wisdom that cross style lines and are universal, designed to help jazz, rock, blues, acoustic, and players of all styles play better. Q: I see you have different options for the Foundations Course. Which version should I get?A: This depends on whether you're a beginner or intermediate-advanced (our courses are labeled for either beginner or intermediate and above), how fast you want to learn, your budget. Your choices include the Foundations Course “Chalk Talk” videos with animation and workbook, the Foundations Course Supplemental Video, the 10-Minute Foundations Workout Course, and all of the above with online tutoring.Q: I think great playing is all about talent—so how can this course help?A: Well, first off, we strongly disagree. Yes, there are genuine talents—Hendrix, for instance—to whom, perhaps, guitar playing came easily (though we’re pretty sure he practiced—a lot and with great precision). They are one in a million. Still, most of the best guitarists worked at it; just ask them.Q: How tough is the material to understand?A: The material is understandable to most, even very young players who have someone to help them. Some of the concepts involve seemingly simple ideas, such as slow practice. Some involve more complex ideas, such as understanding systems and motion. But with a little patience, nearly anyone can master the material.Q: How do I get the most out of this course?A: First: Like the karate student who should do what the instructor says at first, POG students do best when taking each AXiom™ to heart before trying to tweak it.Second: While you don’t have to practice hours a day, consistent practice while applying the technical lessons will optimize your results.Third: It’s best to stick with one AXiom™ at a time, applying the technique until it is a habit before jumping from one AXiom™ to another. (Note that we include a practice guide for getting the most out of the course.)Who Should Get the Course?Are you intellectually curious? Do you wonder exactly how to make your fingers work better? Do enjoy studying and practicing? Does the idea of a scientific approach to playing appeal to you? Do you want to get better fast and out-shred nearly everyone? If you answered yes to these questions, then you’re a Physics of Guitar Playing® Institute kind of guitar player!Who Shouldn't Get the Course?It’s important to us that the right people invest in our courses. While we believe that nearly any player can benefit, we would rather turn away those not the best fit. Some who should consider NOT joining us: Students who think they can learn to play great in a few months, students who never practice, students who already know everything, and those not interested in a scientific (we might say “nerdy”) approach. Please review this entire page and the sample videos; if the information doesn’t click, perhaps our courses aren’t for you. But if they do, join us!But What If I'm Just Starting Out?Even if you’ve never played, you can surpass your more experienced friends by learning the right way, right away. While the Foundations Course is primarily geared toward those with experience, using the course in conjunction with lessons, and with our Beginner’s Guide to Playing Guitar, can jumpstart your playing. It can help you play better than people with more experience because you will truly understand how to think and play like a pro guitarist.What Students Say: Our Advisory TeamMeet the Experts from Physics of Guitar Institute!Chief Course Advisor: Bruce ArnoldBruce Arnold has taught at some of the most prestigious music schools in America, including the New England Conservatory of Music, Dartmouth, Berklee, and he currently teaches at Princeton and City College of New York.

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I am a Jamaican born Singer/Songwriter/Musician. I've been a Christian since i was eleven (11) years old. I wrote my first song at thirteen (13) years old after which songwriting became almost like a musical diary to me where i get to pour out about whatever my meditation is on. I've been doing praise and worship at various churches: Christ Alive Christian Center with Pastors Dean Brown and Pastor Baker, Faith Cathedral Deliverance Center with Pastor &amp; Bishop Blair, Lighthouse Church of God with Pastor Alldredge and Pastor Gresham. These men and woman of God have all ministered to me, encouraging me to do that which God has called me to do. I released my debut album ""Shelter of Love"" in Jamaica in February of 2012. Now God has blessed me with inspiration once more to start this project - Love Personified: The Movement.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Should You Be Interested?</h3>
<p>This project is important to me because it is totally dependent on God's provision through you. This is faith put into action. I have not released any new music in five (5) years and now i am itching to get these songs out there to you. They have been a blessing to the few ears that have heard them so far but now i want you to hear them and be blessed also.  This project is a global challenge to all of us to see why God is so big on love and why we must strive to be the same with one another. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This six-track project needs <u><strong>$7500 USD</strong></u> to be completed and airplay ready, That total will cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited studio time for the duration of the project</li>
<li>Professional Musicians, Background Vocalist(s), studio producer and engineer</li>
<li>Cost to completely mix, master and finalize the project</li>
<li>Professional Photo Shoot and Album Design </li>
<li>Performance Soundtracks</li>
<li>Digital distribution to major online outlets. such as Itunes, CDBaby, Amazon etc.</li>
<li>Copyrighting, Mechanical Licensing, etc.</li>
<li>500 count Packaged CDs.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Love Personified came from what started as an internal interrogation at a bus stop and turned into a prayer asking God for that unconditional love to love others even when you've been hurt and to reach out in love to those you don't even know are hurting just like you. Instead of all of us shutting down and hiding within ourselves because we don't want to be vulnerable again. Our love is conditional, we all have stories of how we said we would never fall in love again, or we would never trust someone again etc. These are the times when that love is tested and oftentimes destroyed. But, what if we dared to continue to love even in the face of our enemies. Could we ever find it in ourselves to be unwavering in our love for the people who are actively seek our destruction?</p>
<p>There are songs of encouragement, songs of adoration, worship and meditation and songs that challenge your heart about decisions we've made in our lives as Christians.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It is difficult to fund an album yourself when you are an independent artiste, but with your help and you believing in me to accomplish this - It will be done and it will be AMAZING!</p>
<p>I am trying by all means to fund this project because i believe God wants to do something with these songs. I also believe that once you hear them you too will catch the vision and it will be made plain. This is a movement and i pray it will spread across the world. </p>
<p>The producers have heard the demos and they are chomping at the bit so to speak to get started on this new and innovative project. New sounds, new genres, even what i'm known for - Praise and Worship, will be making its appearance on the album this time. I wasn't so fortunate the first time around with ""Shelter of Love"". There's a little bit of everything coming at you on this project so please help me make this happen.</p>

They have been a blessing to the few ears that have heard them so far but now i want you to hear them and be blessed also.  This project is a global challenge to all of us to see why God is so big on love and why we must strive to be the same with one another. 
 

What I Need & What You Get
This six-track project needs $7500 USD to be completed and airplay ready, That total will cover the following:

Unlimited studio time for the duration of the project
Professional Musicians, Background Vocalist(s), studio producer and engineer
Cost to completely mix, master and finalize the project
Professional Photo Shoot and Album Design 
Performance Soundtracks
Digital distribution to major online outlets. such as Itunes, CDBaby, Amazon etc.
Copyrighting, Mechanical Licensing, etc.
500 count Packaged CDs.


The Impact
Love Personified came from what started as an internal interrogation at a bus stop and turned into a prayer asking God for that unconditional love to love others even when you've been hurt and to reach out in love to those you don't even know are hurting just like you. Instead of all of us shutting down and hiding within ourselves because we don't want to be vulnerable again. Our love is conditional, we all have stories of how we said we would never fall in love again, or we would never trust someone again etc. These are the times when that love is tested and oftentimes destroyed. But, what if we dared to continue to love even in the face of our enemies. Could we ever find it in ourselves to be unwavering in our love for the people who are actively seek our destruction?
There are songs of encouragement, songs of adoration, worship and meditation and songs that challenge your heart about decisions we've made in our lives as Christians.

Risks & Challenges
It is difficult to fund an album yourself when you are an independent artiste, but with your help and you believing in me to accomplish this - It will be done and it will be AMAZING!
I am trying by all means to fund this project because i believe God wants to do something with these songs. I also believe that once you hear them you too will catch the vision and it will be made plain. This is a movement and i pray it will spread across the world. 
The producers have heard the demos and they are chomping at the bit so to speak to get started on this new and innovative project. New sounds, new genres, even what i'm known for - Praise and Worship, will be making its appearance on the album this time. I wasn't so fortunate the first time around with ""Shelter of Love"". There's a little bit of everything coming at you on this project so please help me make this happen.

<p>The fundraising is for my friend, Shahd Syoufi, who is an extremely talented and fiercely passionate musician. Shahd comes from the city of Homs in Syria. Presently, she lives in Germany where her family moved in 2013, given the situation in Syria, because of the civil war.</p>
<p>""I have dreamed of becoming a singer since the day I learned to talk, maybe even before that"", she would say when asked about her dreams.</p>
<p>As a kid, she was encouraged to pursue her passion for singing where she used to perform at school functions and sometimes at family gatherings. But coming from a society where music, dance and other such art forms are mostly frowned upon when pursued by women, she lost the support when she came of age.</p>
<p>But, things changed (mostly for good) when she moved to Germany where she is more free from the boundaries of a restrictive society. She is twenty-three and studying at the University of Stuttgart. She is a fierce advocate for women's rights especially in the Arabic world and wishes to inspire women to pursue their passions and dreams and fight the restrictions of the society they live in.</p>
<p>She has kept alive her passion for singing through her youtube channel where she uploads English and Arabic songs. Currently, she is working on her first original single. The song will be in Arabic, and will urge women to think about their lives and think freely. But, being a student, and trying to live independently without depending on her parents for finances, while facing criticism from her community, she needs our help.</p>

<p>My new recording is called ""7""  and it is looking at how there are patterns of rest found in ""7"". it is a good idea rest on the 7th day, it is good to rest on the 7th week and people often get a chance to change rhythm in the 7th year. We tend to think of the day as having 3 parts but many years ago there were actually 7 parts. This recording will explore what different stages look like and will reflect this lyrically and musically in a creative way. </p>

We live in age where there are countless albums to stream on Spotify and Apple.  I love supporting artists I know and who are independent. In backing this recording you will help me  independently produce songs and keep creativity alive.</p>
<p><strong>What's the craic?</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>So what does this involve? </p>
<p>It involves recording costs in the studio </p>
<p>It includes designing the CD </p>
<p>It also includes manufacturing the CD (they actually all go off to a factory and get made by the CD making people in long coats)  </p>
<p>When you add this all up its around  £3000 - who knew CD's cost so much? we thought they got made for free!</p>

<h3>The Story:</h3>
<p>I simply MUST do this. I am compelled. It is my mission and purpose in life to create music.</p>
<p>I have tried to get out of this and run, but there is nowhere to hide. </p>
<p>About 14 years ago after a great upheaval and change in my life, I sold or gave away every piece of music equipment I had left,  I was happy to turn my back on music forever, live happily ever after as a “Regular Joe” with a secure paycheck and work toward a beautiful retirement during which maybe - just maybe - I might dabble in music occasionally as a nice hobby in my golden years. </p>
<p>But little did I know that a second crisis/collapse was looming just ahead as my very successful and meteoric rise in the non-music corporate world was coming to an abrupt end as quickly as it had started after only 7 years. I won’t go into all the details, but let’s just say every “Here’s your sign” joke and obvious closed door / open door directive from all of creation pointed in unison toward getting back into music. </p>
<p>So off I went into yet ANOTHER career change within a few short years but this time I was in my fifties and not getting any younger! </p>
<p>But an amazing thing started to happen IN me as all these things were happening TO me. </p>
<p>I learned that I just happened to be good at music so I just need to be OK with that and stop fighting it. What else could I do?</p>
<p>I feel I am just barely beginning to find peace by stepping confidently into the depths of what I have been made to do. That is what the launch of this Third Leg, these recordings, and this campaign is all about. Please join me in this adventure! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Music:</h3>
<p>Although THE STORY is the Big Idea behind all this and what I want you to get behind and support, here’s some of the nuts and bolts about all of this, including the beautiful music this project will give life to:</p>
<div>
<p><strong><i>You can see samples of music to be included in these recordings below the intro video at the top, as well as periodically through social media throughout the campaign. Be sure to take some time to enjoy them now and to follow me in your favorite social media platforms (see links below) so you won’t miss anything! This is some pretty awesome music! You will not be disappointed!</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Instrumental Album</strong> will include piano and full instrumental original compositions. It will be beautiful background music in “New Age” or “Classical Crossover” styles. This album will also become the source material  presented in various formats for video synchronization. It will also be available at a later date in printed form for piano students of various levels to play.</p>
<p><strong>The Cover Songs Album</strong> will be a selection of songs from among the hundreds I perform regularly in gigs at private parties and elsewhere. I will record piano/vocal recordings of songs selected by you if you partner with me at Associate Producer level or above! Songs span the last 100 years from early 20th century standards, later 20th century classic rock, and 21st Century singer-songwriters</p>
<p><strong>The Christian Album</strong> includes many of the songs written and recorded during my earlier years traveling the nation and working in Nashville as a Contemporary Christian music artist, songwriter and worship leader. Although I no longer write or perform for this genre, these are some of my favorites that will finally be re-mastered and re-released with 21st century audio standards and formats.</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>Here’s how the money raised will enable us to complete the recording, editing, mastering and distribution for 3 of the 5 projects already under way, and maybe even give us a head start on the two scheduled for next year:</p>
<p><strong>Unfinished Project 1 )</strong> Editing and segmenting the instrumental recording that was previously composed as background music to a DVD educational series. These musical themes need to be divided into smaller segments for use as a listening project for CD and streaming and video synchronization.</p>
<p><strong>Unfinished Project 2 )</strong> The recording of many of the cover songs I currently perform regularly when I do background music or other performance gigs. I have always wanted to have quality recordings to sell at these events and also to use in promotion and distribution through streaming and other means.</p>
<p><strong>Unfinished Project 3 ) </strong>Editing and re-mastering of a selection of songs from my earlier contemporary Christian and worship music recordings. By cleaning these up, many of these great songs may get a second chance to be heard by a new generation through streaming and other means.</p>
<p>All three of these projects will also need to have packaging and graphics developed for digital and physical distribution, along with as many professionally produced videos to accompany them as we can afford the time and money for. Also, any songs written by others will need to have licensing fees paid for the commercial use of them as well as proper credits developed and posted. There are fees to process each song for proper UPC coding, royalty tracking and distribution through independent music amalgamators like CD Baby or Tunecore, who will in turn distribute to the appropriate channels for streaming and sale around the world through channels like Amazon, Apple Music, Spotify and others. It's quite an interesting process and I'll keep you updated.</p>
<p><strong>Possible start of future projects ) </strong>In addition, if time and money permits, I would like to be able to produce one or two more ""teaser"" recordings for the next two projects in the pipeline. These will be the singer songwriter genre of original songs that already has several completed songs, and the long awaited (and way too promised) upcoming Christmas recording. Those releases would help build more of a following before the full release of both those major projects, hopefully in 2020. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get:</h3>
<p>There are perks and rewards tailored for every level of giving that will be sent to everyone who gives. Be sure to review the various levels of each perk that is displayed. You need to click on or tap each perk to open up the details for each. They are really awesome packages so look through the details!</p>
<p>Everyone will be kept informed of progress and pertinent updates, but to be truly a part of the community I would like to build around this, please consider supporting at the <strong>Associate Producer</strong> level or higher. At that level I will be getting back with you for specific instructions on how to help me complete each of these projects and what to include for future ones. I have lots of fun ideas to involve you with these and other projects as well, so I hope as many of you can be part of this as possible. It's just a bit more to get into that level from the all-music package, so go ahead! I know you will see it is worth it!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>Unlike some crowdfunding campaigns, this one will not be “All or Nothing”. If the full amount of the minimal goal is not reached, I will still be able to get all products described in the perks out the door using a larger percentage of funds from teaching and other sources than I would like to.   Regardless of the progress, you will all be updated regularly over the next few months through this forum and social media or email as you request.  </p>

I simply MUST do this. I am compelled. It is my mission and purpose in life to create music.
I have tried to get out of this and run, but there is nowhere to hide. 
About 14 years ago after a great upheaval and change in my life, I sold or gave away every piece of music equipment I had left,  I was happy to turn my back on music forever, live happily ever after as a “Regular Joe” with a secure paycheck and work toward a beautiful retirement during which maybe - just maybe - I might dabble in music occasionally as a nice hobby in my golden years. 
But little did I know that a second crisis/collapse was looming just ahead as my very successful and meteoric rise in the non-music corporate world was coming to an abrupt end as quickly as it had started after only 7 years. I won’t go into all the details, but let’s just say every “Here’s your sign” joke and obvious closed door / open door directive from all of creation pointed in unison toward getting back into music. 
So off I went into yet ANOTHER career change within a few short years but this time I was in my fifties and not getting any younger! 
But an amazing thing started to happen IN me as all these things were happening TO me. 
I learned that I just happened to be good at music so I just need to be OK with that and stop fighting it. What else could I do?
I feel I am just barely beginning to find peace by stepping confidently into the depths of what I have been made to do. That is what the launch of this Third Leg, these recordings, and this campaign is all about. Please join me in this adventure! 
 
The Music:
Although THE STORY is the Big Idea behind all this and what I want you to get behind and support, here’s some of the nuts and bolts about all of this, including the beautiful music this project will give life to:

You can see samples of music to be included in these recordings below the intro video at the top, as well as periodically through social media throughout the campaign. Be sure to take some time to enjoy them now and to follow me in your favorite social media platforms (see links below) so you won’t miss anything! This is some pretty awesome music! You will not be disappointed!
The Instrumental Album will include piano and full instrumental original compositions. It will be beautiful background music in “New Age” or “Classical Crossover” styles. This album will also become the source material  presented in various formats for video synchronization.

Because of that, many of our fans and supporters, whom we kindly call ""Sentinels of The Starry Skies"", have been asking for a physical version of it, which we can't make happen without the proper budget. So we ask for your help to relase Daphne in physical format with three very special surprises: the first ever EP released by Ruins of Elysium, Prince, completely free as remixed and remastered bonus tracks. But it is not over!<br/>Our upcoming album is already written and ready to be produced. There will be 8/9 songs ranging to aprox. 75 minutes of pure epic metal and we can unveil the name of some of the tracks: ""Kama Sutra"", ""Serpentarius"", ""Shadow of The Colossus"", our own version of Amy Winehouse/TheZoutons classic ""Valerie"" and the gargantuan 40 minutes long symphony that names the album, ""Seeds of Chaos and Serenity"". Those seeds can't be sown without your help, so we are counting with your support on this new adventure, Sentinels of the Starry Skies!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Having an album printed is not a cheap task, so we need the funds to help bringing into existance the physical copies of Daphne, the EP that spread Ruins of Elysium's name to the world. All copies will come signed with a personal dedication to the purchaser by all the brazilian members and the remixed and remastered versions of the 3 songs of our debut EP, Prince: ""Prince"", ""The Chronicles of Mist"" and ""Sentinels of The Starry Skies"".</p>
<p>For Seeds of Chaos and Serenity, this task is pushed even further because we pushed ourselves even further on writing this album. The songs are all huge, orchestra-wise or lenght-wise (or both lol) and demand extra production, which will be in charge of Greek producer Georgia Damigou and our guitar player and producer Vincenzo Avallone. Not only counting production and studio time, we also need artwork, professional band photos, image manipulations for the social medias e don't forget the extra merchandise such as posters and t-shirts. If we don't reach our goal, the album will still happen, but it may take a little more time for the band to raise the money by themselves.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The support of fans make all the difference in the crowded and even cruel music world of today. It is still hard for unsigned and independent bands to produce and release their material in the best possible ways, even though digital distribution has made it somewhat easier.

</div></div>","Short Summary Epic Symphonic Metal band Ruins of Elysium is making history on the heavy metal scene for being the first ever tenor fronted symphonic metal band and our latest release, Daphne, was acclaimed all over the world as innovative, powerful and really, really epic. Because of that, many of our fans and supporters, whom we kindly call ""Sentinels of The Starry Skies"", have been asking for a physical version of it, which we can't make happen without the proper budget. So we ask for your help to relase Daphne in physical format with three very special surprises: the first ever EP released by Ruins of Elysium, Prince, completely free as remixed and remastered bonus tracks. But it is not over!Our upcoming album is already written and ready to be produced. There will be 8/9 songs ranging to aprox. 75 minutes of pure epic metal and we can unveil the name of some of the tracks: ""Kama Sutra"", ""Serpentarius"", ""Shadow of The Colossus"", our own version of Amy Winehouse/TheZoutons classic ""Valerie"" and the gargantuan 40 minutes long symphony that names the album, ""Seeds of Chaos and Serenity"". Those seeds can't be sown without your help, so we are counting with your support on this new adventure, Sentinels of the Starry Skies!   What We Need & What You Get Having an album printed is not a cheap task, so we need the funds to help bringing into existance the physical copies of Daphne, the EP that spread Ruins of Elysium's name to the world. All copies will come signed with a personal dedication to the purchaser by all the brazilian members and the remixed and remastered versions of the 3 songs of our debut EP, Prince: ""Prince"", ""The Chronicles of Mist"" and ""Sentinels of The Starry Skies"".
For Seeds of Chaos and Serenity, this task is pushed even further because we pushed ourselves even further on writing this album. The songs are all huge, orchestra-wise or lenght-wise (or both lol) and demand extra production, which will be in charge of Greek producer Georgia Damigou and our guitar player and producer Vincenzo Avallone. Not only counting production and studio time, we also need artwork, professional band photos, image manipulations for the social medias e don't forget the extra merchandise such as posters and t-shirts. If we don't reach our goal, the album will still happen, but it may take a little more time for the band to raise the money by themselves.
    The Impact The support of fans make all the difference in the crowded and even cruel music world of today. It is still hard for unsigned and independent bands to produce and release their material in the best possible ways, even though digital distribution has made it somewhat easier. The majority of Ruins of Elysium is based in Brazil and the scenario for metal and specially symphonic metal has been losing ground here, so it becomes harder and harder to produce and release an abum.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Inspired by Talking Heads music and their own</strong></p>
<p>In the summer of 2013 a group of Portland, Oregon musicians got together around the love of Talking Heads music. Especially that of the epic 1984 concert film, Stop Making Sense, which they consider to be the most brilliant concert film of all time. They began to perform with a 7-piece lineup that was inspired by that particular movie and time period. “There was so much funkiness, movement, and excitement to the music in that movie and we just knew it would get people excited and feel fresh” says Lawrence Orleck, co-founder and singer in the band.</p>
<p>Audiences keep coming back to see LDW. Not only for their exuberant interpretations of the legendary Talking Heads, but also for their original music, improvisation, choreography and the random experiences they deliver at every one of their shows. In a matter of 2 years they were playing to sold out shows all over the west coast and found themselves with the question: “What’s next?”</p>
<p><strong>The upcoming Album – Movement in a spirited manner</strong></p>
<p>For LDW, every performance matters, and, it’s that mantra, that has the band in the studio recording their first album, Movement in a spirited manner. “We were so inspired by playing David Byrne’s music for 3 years that we found ourselves in the studio writing this album and it just naturally fit into our set. That’s our evolution and trajectory. But, yes, we still play a ton of talking heads because, plain and simple, it’s fun. We named it Movement in a spirited manner because for the last 3 years we have been enthralled with the excitement and motion of our fans. They get down, big time.” Lawrence muses.</p>
<p>About the Album:</p>
<p>This is our first full-length record! The album will have 10 songs, including a nod to a classic Talking Heads tune...no, we won't tell you which one just yet!<br/> </p>
<p>The Collaborators:</p>
<p><br/>Producers:  Paul Chandler, Steveland Swatkins, Anthony Resta<br/>Musicians: Lawrence Orleck, Jessa Campbell, Taylor Stapleton, Hayley Dolan, Chuck Warda, Paul Chandler, Steveland Swatkins, Tyrone Hendrix, Joshua Simon<br/>Mix Engineer: Justin Phelps, Karyadi Sutedja<br/> </p>

<p>Your Support. As a completely independent with a small team, (completely funded by ourselves), the only way we continue going is by our own work, and you, our incredible fans. It would literally be impossible without your help.<br/>We need about $30,000 to make the recordings, the rewards &amp; to pay all of the super talented and deserving musicians. We are hoping to raise a portion of that here.<br/>I know, I know. The number seems big, but we tried to cut our costs as much as possible without sacrificing the quality of music you deserve. We are working hard, and working smart! </p>
<p>There are tons of cool perks. Some of them are going to be exclusive to Indie-Gogo.<br/>Which means, you will have what no one else does as a major thank you for making this happen.<br/>And as an extra thank you, once we hit 50% funding we are going to be sharing the lyrics to Ebb &amp; Flow, the original track featured in the video. </p>
<p>If we don't reach the entire goal, it will take a bit longer to put out the album, but we will continue investing into this project until it's completed! This isn't a Road to Nowhere!</p>

<p>Now I am asking for your help. Help me achieve my dream of recording my first full length album of my original songs, titled ""Small Town Big Heart.""</p>
<p>I finally decided at the age of forty-nine to pursue this life long dream of mine. I bought my first guitar and began teaching myself to play. I had songs deep within me and wanted to get them out. I am now fifty-one, and in the two short years since picking up that guitar, I have recorded and released an EP of my first four songs. I have shared the studio and stage with such notables as Marty Stuart, Rudy Gatlin, Dale Watson, Red Simpson, Theresa Spanke, WS ""Fluke"" Holland, and others.</p>
<p> I feel now is the time, and I am whole heartedly ready to answer this call.</p>

<br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>So Here's The Deal...</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">As an independent artist, I am on my own to make my dream a reality. I don't have the financial backing from music industry professionals or a record label. As such, it is up to me to get my music written, recorded, manufactured, marketed, and distributed. It is a daunting task indeed to have your music heard in today's music business climate. It takes a lot of money, time, and effort to make it happen.</span></h3>
<div><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">But it is my dream, and I am in full pursuit.</span></div>
<p>Let me break it down for you in more detail:</p> <ul> <li>Recording studios charge by the hour for their services to record and mix your songs. Generally speaking, a safe estimate for an independent artist is 3-4 hours per song at around $100 per hour.   </li>
<li>Session artists (professional musicians hired to play on your session) charge by the hour, the song, or by the instrument. I generally have 4-8 on each song. Average rate is around $150-$300 per instrument per song.</li>
<li>While I do have a couple of projects under my belt as a Producer, I have decided to bring in a fresh set of ears for this album. I am very fortunate to have the multi award winning Producer Milo Deering joining me on this album.</li>
<li> Once the album is recorded, and mixed, it will need to be mastered. This is the process that really smooths out the sound files and prepares them for their final format of digital download, CD, and Vinyl. Each format requires it's own mastering. This step is generally around $1000-$2000 for a project this size.</li>
<li>Then there is the artwork! This step usually requires a professional photographer and an on location photo shoot. In addition the services of a quality graphic artist are required to design and format the Album/CD cover. Go ahead and budget $1500-$2000 for these services.</li>
<li>Next up...Replication! This is where your project really comes alive. Your digital files and artwork are now sent to a Replicator who prints and packages your Album. This cost is based on how fancy you want your packaging, and the number of copies you want printed..the more you print, the lower the cost per unit.  You're looking at around $1500- $3000 for an initial print.</li>
<li>Now you have to get your brand new record out so all of your adoring fans can purchase it. Distribution! You can spend a small fortune in this step. This is where the indie artist has to get really creative. Fortunately there are many online outlets available including online stores such as CDBaby, itunes, Apple music, etc. as well as a host of internet radio stations to potentially play and help sell your music. This step requires a lot of time, and effort to be successful. A budget of around $3000 for the initial start up here can help you go a long way in this step if you're willing to work it hard...I am!</li> <li>All told I'm looking at an estimated cost for all of the above to be around $1500-$2000 per song, and  ""Small Town Big Heart"" is slated for thirteen songs.</li> <li>My hope is to raise most, if not all of the needed funds through this campaign. Any shortages will come out of my pocket. I am determined to succeed.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Bang For Your Buck...</h3> <p>The bottom line is I can't do this project without your help:</p> <ul> <li>Now, I know there are a lot of wanna-be songwriters out there, and they all need help making their dreams come true. I truly believe I have written some really good songs, and I think they will stand on their own, and stand the test of time. My ultimate goal is to shop some of these songs around to the big boys in country music and get them to record them on their projects.</li> <li>I have spent the past fifteen years of my life involved in the music business as more or less a hobby. I have produced and promoted just under two hundred shows, from small house shows, to large outdoor festivals. I have worked as a producer on my first record, and co-produced an album for Bakersfield Recording artist, Theresa Spanke. I have become well versed in the world of music, and I'm ready to make my mark as not only a successful promoter/producer, but as a multi genre singer/songwriter. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What I'm Up Against...</h3> <p>I have eluded to the fact that I'm not a spring chicken. I'm also not afraid of a challenge. That being said, there are some harsh realities for a person such as myself trying to break into a new, highly fortified world.</p> <ul> <li>Today's music business gatekeepers say I have to be young and beautiful in order to be successful in their world...I don't buy into that.</li> <li>They say they know what YOU and I as music lovers want. Judging by most of what I hear of their choices today...I don't buy into that.</li>
<li>They say the era of music with meaningful stories is dead and gone...I don't buy into that.</li>
<li>They say I can't be a part of their world unless they control me...I don't buy into that.</li>
<li>If any of what you have read here rings true to you, then I need you to buy into me!</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Times Are Tough All Over...</h3> <p>Hey I understand. Money is tight for a lot of us, and if you can't contribute right now...don't sweat it. You can still help me out tremendously:</p> <ul> <li>You can simply make a little noise about me and my dream and campaign by sharing me on your social media outlets. There are tools here on Indiegogo that are available for you to help.</li> <li>If you see me playing a show somewhere, stop by and say hello, maybe buy a CD or a t-shirt or something!</li> </ul> </div> <p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","The Skinny...  For more than twenty-four years I have answered the call.

I am a story teller, and that is one thing sorely missing in country music today. How big is your heart? Will you answer the call and help me get my music out there?

   So Here's The Deal...
As an independent artist, I am on my own to make my dream a reality. I don't have the financial backing from music industry professionals or a record label. As such, it is up to me to get my music written, recorded, manufactured, marketed, and distributed. It is a daunting task indeed to have your music heard in today's music business climate. It takes a lot of money, time, and effort to make it happen.
But it is my dream, and I am in full pursuit.
Let me break it down for you in more detail:  Recording studios charge by the hour for their services to record and mix your songs. Generally speaking, a safe estimate for an independent artist is 3-4 hours per song at around $100 per hour.   
Session artists (professional musicians hired to play on your session) charge by the hour, the song, or by the instrument. I generally have 4-8 on each song. Average rate is around $150-$300 per instrument per song.
While I do have a couple of projects under my belt as a Producer, I have decided to bring in a fresh set of ears for this album. I am very fortunate to have the multi award winning Producer Milo Deering joining me on this album.
 Once the album is recorded, and mixed, it will need to be mastered. This is the process that really smooths out the sound files and prepares them for their final format of digital download, CD, and Vinyl. Each format requires it's own mastering. This step is generally around $1000-$2000 for a project this size.
Then there is the artwork! This step usually requires a professional photographer and an on location photo shoot. In addition the services of a quality graphic artist are required to design and format the Album/CD cover. Go ahead and budget $1500-$2000 for these services.
Next up...Replication! This is where your project really comes alive. Your digital files and artwork are now sent to a Replicator who prints and packages your Album. This cost is based on how fancy you want your packaging, and the number of copies you want printed..the more you print, the lower the cost per unit.  You're looking at around $1500- $3000 for an initial print.
Now you have to get your brand new record out so all of your adoring fans can purchase it. Distribution! You can spend a small fortune in this step. This is where the indie artist has to get really creative. Fortunately there are many online outlets available including online stores such as CDBaby, itunes, Apple music, etc. as well as a host of internet radio stations to potentially play and help sell your music. This step requires a lot of time, and effort to be successful. A budget of around $3000 for the initial start up here can help you go a long way in this step if you're willing to work it hard...I am! All told I'm looking at an estimated cost for all of the above to be around $1500-$2000 per song, and  ""Small Town Big Heart"" is slated for thirteen songs. My hope is to raise most, if not all of the needed funds through this campaign. Any shortages will come out of my pocket. I am determined to succeed.    The Bang For Your Buck... The bottom line is I can't do this project without your help:  Now, I know there are a lot of wanna-be songwriters out there, and they all need help making their dreams come true. I truly believe I have written some really good songs, and I think they will stand on their own, and stand the test of time. My ultimate goal is to shop some of these songs around to the big boys in country music and get them to record them on their projects. I have spent the past fifteen years of my life involved in the music business as more or less a hobby. I have produced and promoted just under two hundred shows, from small house shows, to large outdoor festivals. I have worked as a producer on my first record, and co-produced an album for Bakersfield Recording artist, Theresa Spanke. I have become well versed in the world of music, and I'm ready to make my mark as not only a successful promoter/producer, but as a multi genre singer/songwriter.     What I'm Up Against... I have eluded to the fact that I'm not a spring chicken. I'm also not afraid of a challenge. That being said, there are some harsh realities for a person such as myself trying to break into a new, highly fortified world.  Today's music business gatekeepers say I have to be young and beautiful in order to be successful in their world...I don't buy into that. They say they know what YOU and I as music lovers want. Judging by most of what I hear of their choices today...I don't buy into that.
They say the era of music with meaningful stories is dead and gone...I don't buy into that.
They say I can't be a part of their world unless they control me...I don't buy into that.
If any of what you have read here rings true to you, then I need you to buy into me!    Times Are Tough All Over... Hey I understand. Money is tight for a lot of us, and if you can't contribute right now...don't sweat it. You can still help me out tremendously:  You can simply make a little noise about me and my dream and campaign by sharing me on your social media outlets. There are tools here on Indiegogo that are available for you to help. If you see me playing a show somewhere, stop by and say hello, maybe buy a CD or a t-shirt or something!   And that's all there is to it.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The Project</span>
</h3><p>During the Summer of 2016, I will finally fulfill a lifelong dream of mine by hiking the New England portion of the <a href=""http://www.appalachiantrail.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Appalachian Trail</a>, a journey of more than 700 miles (about one-third of the entire 2,200 mile trail.)  I grew up in Massachusetts and spent many weekends exploring the woods and wilderness of this region.  Then I will spend the next year realizing another long-held dream of mine, to write my first symphony for orchestra, which will be a 20-25 minute symphony inspired by the experiences hiking the trail, commissioned by a consortium of orchestras across New England for the 80th anniversary of the completion of the trail.  The work will be in five movements, one for each New England state the trail passes through (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine) with the music for each arising from my experiences hiking in that particular state.  Professional, community, and collegiate orchestras from these five New England states will each premiere the work in their own communities during the 2017-18 season.  Orchestras already on board include the <a href=""http://www.claflinhill.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Claflin Hill Symphony Orchestra</a> (Milford, MA), the <a href=""http://www.wellesleysymphony.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wellesley Symphony Orchestra</a> in (Wellesley, MA), and the <a href=""http://www.wesleyan.edu/music/performance/orchestra.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wesleyan University Orchestra</a> in (Middletown, CT).  Several more orchestras are interested, and we expect these ensembles to join the consortium within the next year.</p><p>We are also partnering with the <a href=""http://www.appalachiantrail.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Appalachian Trail Conservancy</a> who is planning to have an orchestra from Maine perform the work as the main entertainment feature at their next Biennial Conference (August 4-10, 2017) at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, co-sponsored by the <a href=""http://www.outdoors.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Appalachian Mountain Club</a> and the <a href=""http://www.matc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Maine Appalachian Trail Club</a>. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>But this project is more than just a realization of my own dreams and goals, and I am a firm believer that music can be a catalyst for positive change in the world.  Through these concerts throughout New England, associated educational events, and the publicity surrounding them, local orchestras will connect with the environmentalists and nature enthusiasts in their communities, a population that is not traditionally associated with classical music, in addition to their usual audiences. Likewise, this project will inspire and encourage classical music fans throughout the region to enjoy their local wilderness, including the Appalachian Trail, and to support local conservation efforts.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While I have never done a hike of this length, I have an athletic background and have done several shorter overnight hikes on the Appalachian Trail in the past.  In high school, I played Soccer, varsity Basketball, and was a league All-Star Tennis player.  I once cycled 100+ miles across Massachusetts and more recently played club Cricket in England.  In the past few months, I have been getting in shape with shorter hikes, treadmill runs, and researching gear, food, guidebooks, and other issues related with such a long hike.  I plan on hiking at least 10 miles per day which would mean finishing the hike in about 2.5 months, although I am giving myself 3 full months to do the hike to allow some buffer time in case something happens.</p>
<p>While I have certainly had my own doubts about completing such a long hike, during an overnight hike on the Appalachian Trail this past Summer I met a man in his 60's who was diabetic and had completed over three-quarters of the trail already.  If he can gather enough strength and determination to complete the trail, then certainly myself, a 28-year-old in good health and shape, has no excuses for not completing a 3rd of the trail.  Plus, I'm the kind of person who, when he is passionate about doing something, never even thinks about backing out of it.</p>
<p>If, however, for any reason the project is not completed, every effort will be made to return donations. </p><p>In terms of composing, I have been a professional composer for the past five years and have been commissioned by other groups such as the <a href=""http://www.comusicteachers.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Colorado State Music Teachers Association</a>, the <a href=""https://academics.nsuok.edu/band/Ensembles/WindEnsemble.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Northeastern State University Wind Ensemble (OK)</a>, the Arrowhead Union High School Wind Ensemble (WI), pianist <a href=""http://www.mckiggan.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Christopher Janwong McKiggan</a>, saxophonist <a href=""http://www.allisondadams.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Allison Dromgold Adams</a>, cellist Christine Thomas Tsen, and the <a href=""http://soundsofstow.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sounds of Stow Chorus and Orchestra</a> for which we <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1650532160/sounds-of-stow-commission-a-piano-concerto-by-kean/description"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">successfully ran a similar crowd-funding campaign</a> to raise funds for the commission fee in 2012.</p>

<p>Founded in 1948 as the Wellesley Community Orchestra, the Wellesley Symphony Orchestra was the brainchild of Wellesley residents: BSO violinist Rolland Tapley and Mrs. William Vogler. Maestro Tapley served as music director and conductor for nearly thirty years, offering three or four concerts each season, including a Pops Concert and a Youth Concert. Performances were held in various locations in Wellesley, Littleton and Framingham. Mr. Tapley retired in 1973 and was succeeded by Robert J. Prins (1972-1991) and Michael Webster (1992-1993). Max Hobart has been at the helm since 1993. Since 1984 the Wellesley Symphony Orchestra has been orchestra-in-residence at MassBay Community College.<br/></p>

<p>The Wesleyan University Orchestra has been an integral part of the University’s Music Department for many years. The completion  of the Center for the Arts in 1973 allowed the orchestra to begin a regular annual series of concerts, and the 1980′s saw the rise of a strong orchestral program, first under Roger Solie, and then under Melvin Strauss.</p>
<p>1984 saw the premiere of Henry Brant’s  “Meteor Farm,” a commission which featured not only the orchestra, but also many of the Music Department’s celebrated World Music ensembles.  The 1988 “John Cage at Wesleyan” festival was a high-water mark for the orchestra; it featured a performance of Cage’s “Atlas Eclipticalis” with nearly a hundred performers, and distinguished guest performers including the Arditti Quartet.</p>
<p>Angel Gil-Ordóñez arrived as music director in the Fall of 1998, the orchestra and its members have played with many major artists under a program that brings performers from the CFA Concert Series together with Wesleyan students; among these perfomers have been Igor Kipnis, the Lydian String Quartet, Jaap Schroeder, and Pedro Carboné. Orchestral collaborations have included performances with Wesleyan’s Theater, Dance, and Film departments. The orchestra and theater department produced Tom Stoppard’s “Every Good Boy Deserves Favor” in the Spring of 2001, featuring music by André Previn; opera productions have included “The Countess III”, “Master Peter’s Puppet Show”, and “The Threepenny Opera”.</p>
<p>In Spring 2000, the orchestra initiated the “Millenium Concert”, which included collaborative commissioned works for the Jazz Orchestra and Gamelan, as well as premieres of works by Wesleyan composers. A year later, under the baton of guest conductor Zheng Xiao-ying, China’s first female conductor, the orchestra performed the U.S. premiere of Liu Yuan’s Symphony “Echo of Hakka Earth Buildings” as a part of the Chinese Music Festival “Echoes of the Earth”.  In 2005, as a benefit for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, two New Deal documentaries, the films “The Plow that Broke the Plains” and “The River”, were presented with live musical accompaniment by the orchestra, performing Virgil Thomson’s original scores. Another New Deal Documentary, “The City” (with a score by Aaron Copland), was presented with live music in the Fall of 2007. As a catalyst for contemporary music, the orchestra developed an annual Symphonic Workshop to showcase and premiere works by Wesleyan and other prominent U.S. composers, including Alvin Lucier, Anthony Braxton, Lawrence D. “Butch” Morris, Guilermo Gregorio, and David Amram.  Recent premieres include <em>Mijidwewinan</em> (“Messages”), by Barbara Croall, and <em>Dear Mother Earth</em> by Glenn McClure, both commissioned by the Wesleyan Center for the Arts as culminating events in its “Feet to the Fire” Festival, and for the inaugural year of the College of the Environment.</p>
<p>The Wesleyan Orchestra has also performed a variety of works such as Dvorak, <em>Symphony no 8 in G Major</em>; Holst,<em>Jupiter from ""The Planets""</em>; Brahms, <em>Variations on a Theme by Haydn;</em> Handel, <em>Water Music - Suite in D Major;</em>Mendlessohn, <em>Die Hebriden</em>; and Beethoven, <em>Symphony no. 7 in A Major.</em></p>
</div>
</div>","Update: I'm excited to announce that a 4th orchestra is now on board the project as part of the consortium: The Sage City Symphony from Bennington, VT!  I'm thrilled to have them on board the project as the first orchestra from Vermont!
The Project
During the Summer of 2016, I will finally fulfill a lifelong dream of mine by hiking the New England portion of the Appalachian Trail, a journey of more than 700 miles (about one-third of the entire 2,200 mile trail.)  I grew up in Massachusetts and spent many weekends exploring the woods and wilderness of this region.  Then I will spend the next year realizing another long-held dream of mine, to write my first symphony for orchestra, which will be a 20-25 minute symphony inspired by the experiences hiking the trail, commissioned by a consortium of orchestras across New England for the 80th anniversary of the completion of the trail.  The work will be in five movements, one for each New England state the trail passes through (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine) with the music for each arising from my experiences hiking in that particular state.  Professional, community, and collegiate orchestras from these five New England states will each premiere the work in their own communities during the 2017-18 season.  Orchestras already on board include the Claflin Hill Symphony Orchestra (Milford, MA), the Wellesley Symphony Orchestra in (Wellesley, MA), and the Wesleyan University Orchestra in (Middletown, CT).  Several more orchestras are interested, and we expect these ensembles to join the consortium within the next year.We are also partnering with the Appalachian Trail Conservancy who is planning to have an orchestra from Maine perform the work as the main entertainment feature at their next Biennial Conference (August 4-10, 2017) at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, co-sponsored by the Appalachian Mountain Club and the Maine Appalachian Trail Club. 

Impact

But this project is more than just a realization of my own dreams and goals, and I am a firm believer that music can be a catalyst for positive change in the world.  Through these concerts throughout New England, associated educational events, and the publicity surrounding them, local orchestras will connect with the environmentalists and nature enthusiasts in their communities, a population that is not traditionally associated with classical music, in addition to their usual audiences. Likewise, this project will inspire and encourage classical music fans throughout the region to enjoy their local wilderness, including the Appalachian Trail, and to support local conservation efforts.
We invite you to be a part of the hike and donate to the project to help bring this musical celebration of the Appalachian Trail to life.  Every dollar helps!
Budget
Our goal is to raise at least half of the composer commission fee through this Indiegogo campaign.
Expenses ($22,000)
-$1,500: Estimated costs associated with doing the hike (including purchasing gear, fuel, food, and occasional lodging)
-$500: Indiegogo Campaign Fees
-$20,000: Composer Commission Fee* (includes copying expenses and travel for composer attend the performances)
*Artists deserve to be paid a good wage for their work. ""Meet the Composer's"" Commissioning Music: A Basic Guide suggests a commission fee between $13,000-$60,000 for a 10-25 minute work for full orchestra not including copying expenses and travel to premiere performances.
Funds already raised ($1,500)
-$1,500: $500 from each of the three orchestras that have already joined
Funds to raise ($20,500)
-$1,500: $500 from each additional New England orchestra
-$7,500: New Music USA Grant (pending)
-$1,500: Vermont Arts Council Grant (pending)
-$10,000: Indiegogo Campaign


Risks & Challenges
While I have never done a hike of this length, I have an athletic background and have done several shorter overnight hikes on the Appalachian Trail in the past.  In high school, I played Soccer, varsity Basketball, and was a league All-Star Tennis player.  I once cycled 100+ miles across Massachusetts and more recently played club Cricket in England.  In the past few months, I have been getting in shape with shorter hikes, treadmill runs, and researching gear, food, guidebooks, and other issues related with such a long hike.  I plan on hiking at least 10 miles per day which would mean finishing the hike in about 2.5 months, although I am giving myself 3 full months to do the hike to allow some buffer time in case something happens.
While I have certainly had my own doubts about completing such a long hike, during an overnight hike on the Appalachian Trail this past Summer I met a man in his 60's who was diabetic and had completed over three-quarters of the trail already.  If he can gather enough strength and determination to complete the trail, then certainly myself, a 28-year-old in good health and shape, has no excuses for not completing a 3rd of the trail.  Plus, I'm the kind of person who, when he is passionate about doing something, never even thinks about backing out of it.
If, however, for any reason the project is not completed, every effort will be made to return donations. In terms of composing, I have been a professional composer for the past five years and have been commissioned by other groups such as the Colorado State Music Teachers Association, the Northeastern State University Wind Ensemble (OK), the Arrowhead Union High School Wind Ensemble (WI), pianist Christopher Janwong McKiggan, saxophonist Allison Dromgold Adams, cellist Christine Thomas Tsen, and the Sounds of Stow Chorus and Orchestra for which we successfully ran a similar crowd-funding campaign to raise funds for the commission fee in 2012.

Other Ways You Can Help

Share this campaign with others who might be interested, via social media or word of mouth
Like Keane's Facebook Page and sign up for Keane's email newsletter for updates on the project and his other musical activities.
If I can get to a computer often enough, I will blogging during the hike, so follow along
If you live along the trail in New England and will be around this summer, I'd love to meet you when I pass through.  I'd also be very appreciative of any ""Trail Magic"" you could provide, like giving me a ride into town to buy supplies, letting me sleep on your couch for a night or take a hot shower.

Founded in 1948 as the Wellesley Community Orchestra, the Wellesley Symphony Orchestra was the brainchild of Wellesley residents: BSO violinist Rolland Tapley and Mrs. William Vogler. Maestro Tapley served as music director and conductor for nearly thirty years, offering three or four concerts each season, including a Pops Concert and a Youth Concert. Performances were held in various locations in Wellesley, Littleton and Framingham. Mr. Tapley retired in 1973 and was succeeded by Robert J. Prins (1972-1991) and Michael Webster (1992-1993). Max Hobart has been at the helm since 1993. Since 1984 the Wellesley Symphony Orchestra has been orchestra-in-residence at MassBay Community College.
The Wesleyan University Orchestra


The Wesleyan University Orchestra has been an integral part of the University’s Music Department for many years. The completion  of the Center for the Arts in 1973 allowed the orchestra to begin a regular annual series of concerts, and the 1980′s saw the rise of a strong orchestral program, first under Roger Solie, and then under Melvin Strauss.
1984 saw the premiere of Henry Brant’s  “Meteor Farm,” a commission which featured not only the orchestra, but also many of the Music Department’s celebrated World Music ensembles.  The 1988 “John Cage at Wesleyan” festival was a high-water mark for the orchestra; it featured a performance of Cage’s “Atlas Eclipticalis” with nearly a hundred performers, and distinguished guest performers including the Arditti Quartet.
Angel Gil-Ordóñez arrived as music director in the Fall of 1998, the orchestra and its members have played with many major artists under a program that brings performers from the CFA Concert Series together with Wesleyan students; among these perfomers have been Igor Kipnis, the Lydian String Quartet, Jaap Schroeder, and Pedro Carboné. Orchestral collaborations have included performances with Wesleyan’s Theater, Dance, and Film departments. The orchestra and theater department produced Tom Stoppard’s “Every Good Boy Deserves Favor” in the Spring of 2001, featuring music by André Previn; opera productions have included “The Countess III”, “Master Peter’s Puppet Show”, and “The Threepenny Opera”.
In Spring 2000, the orchestra initiated the “Millenium Concert”, which included collaborative commissioned works for the Jazz Orchestra and Gamelan, as well as premieres of works by Wesleyan composers. A year later, under the baton of guest conductor Zheng Xiao-ying, China’s first female conductor, the orchestra performed the U.S. premiere of Liu Yuan’s Symphony “Echo of Hakka Earth Buildings” as a part of the Chinese Music Festival “Echoes of the Earth”.  In 2005, as a benefit for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, two New Deal documentaries, the films “The Plow that Broke the Plains” and “The River”, were presented with live musical accompaniment by the orchestra, performing Virgil Thomson’s original scores. Another New Deal Documentary, “The City” (with a score by Aaron Copland), was presented with live music in the Fall of 2007. As a catalyst for contemporary music, the orchestra developed an annual Symphonic Workshop to showcase and premiere works by Wesleyan and other prominent U.S. composers, including Alvin Lucier, Anthony Braxton, Lawrence D. “Butch” Morris, Guilermo Gregorio, and David Amram.  Recent premieres include Mijidwewinan (“Messages”), by Barbara Croall, and Dear Mother Earth by Glenn McClure, both commissioned by the Wesleyan Center for the Arts as culminating events in its “Feet to the Fire” Festival, and for the inaugural year of the College of the Environment.
The Wesleyan Orchestra has also performed a variety of works such as Dvorak, Symphony no 8 in G Major; Holst,Jupiter from ""The Planets""; Brahms, Variations on a Theme by Haydn; Handel, Water Music - Suite in D Major;Mendlessohn, Die Hebriden; and Beethoven, Symphony no. 7 in A Major.",4.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Songs from the eye of the storm…</b></p>
<p>8 years ago I saw a friend
playfully plucking a ukulele and thought, 4 strings…I can do that! I thought I
would just play around at home. The playing quickly evolved into intricate
re-arranging of songs, writing my own songs, picking up other instruments and playing
amazing NYC venues over the next few years as my identity as a musician was
born. </p>
<p>Armed with solid songs, I
connected with a producer and started working on my debut album.
Heartbreakingly, I was mislead with the producer, lost thousands of my own dollars and over a year of work, and left with no
finished product. </p>
<p>But now I’m back and ready to
complete this creative journey. I’m partnering with a wonderful new producer
and ready to share with you the songs I have been creating over the past few
years. </p>
<p>To fully realize these songs as I
envision them, I have assembled an incredible team of musicians, creators and
collaborators. These components, along with the recording studio, mixing and
mastering of the album, design elements and all the other curated moments that
go into this process, are expensive. At this point I’ve spent as much of my
personal money as I possibly can, and I have hit a wall.  </p>
<p>So I am asking for help. Help from
my greater community of listeners, co-conspirators, believers. Help from you. </p>
<p>It’s time to bring these songs
from the live experience into the other. Into the personal experience. To be
shared, repeated, and enjoyed outside of the single staged moment. </p>
<p>These songs are written from a maelstrom of chaos and desperation while being anchored in hope and joy. I
believe in the beauty and the truth of these songs. And I know you will too. </p>
<p>Will you partner with me?</p>

<p>It all started deep in the frosty majesty of Rochester, NY's winter landscape.  Long-time pals and former bandmates Jeremy O’Reilly and Alex Northrup began working on some of Northrup’s tunes on their acoustic guitars in the winter of ’14, and decided it was time to find a drummer. After playing together in a one-off Fleetwood Mac cover project and bonding over a mutual admiration of The Band, Travis Johansen soon joined on drums. Adding high-energy Bonham-esque drums, Johansen kicked these previously tame tunes up a notch. With the mix of crashing drums and jangling guitar, the guys rounded out their cast with the Craigslist discovery of AJ Schneeberg, a recent transplant from New Jersey. Synergizing the rhythm section, Schneeberg’s buttery sweet bass lines rock and lock into the groove epitomizing the <a href=""https://northernspiesroc.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.northernspiesband.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Northern Spies’</a> sound.</p>
<p>With this in place, Northern Spies’ updated take on classic power pop and roots rock comes as a worthy addition to the Rochester, NY music scene. 2014’s Nothing But Static EP has garnered them regional airplay, and the upcoming February 2016 release of the single “Do” is set to follow. Blending surfy guitar licks and coded lyrics the Spies appeal to an indie crowd, though their love of bluesy jams, familiar classics, and no-nonsense toe-tapping beats have been winning them a wider audience across western NY. Buffalo’s premier indie music blog Buffablog sates that their sound “recalls acts like Elvis Costello, the Byrds, REM, and Stephen Malkmus.”</p>
<p>Not one to rest on their laurels, the band decided it was time to put their mass of tunes to tape in the format of a full length album. After a successful run recording their soon-to-be released single, ""Do,"" there was no question as to whether or not the Spies would return to 1809 Studios to record their album with Dave Drago. Capturing the spirit of the band, Drago helped to provide further insight to the songs, proving to be one of the best recording collaborations the band has experienced. The yet-to-be-titled album promises to be an engaging statement, and one true to the live four-man sound the band has honed. </p>

Our story has been something kind of like what you would see in a movie.</p>
<p>We all came together a little over a year ago when our lead guitarist, Tommie, met Mark at their first class at the same college. She noticed his Marine Corps desert camouflage pants that he cut into shorts, he happened to sit right next to her and they struck up a conversation about the Marine Corps right away. They both had a goal when they moved to Hollywood, and that was to create one hell of a metal band and to make it our career. So they both ended up jamming together and started the beginnings of Born for War basically in the same day. TK, our drummer, was also going to the same college and we were introduced to him through an all military band in the area called Kings of Carnage. They also helped us get in contact with Sam, our vocalist; who is currently active duty in the Marine Corps on Camp Pendleton, and we all ended up meeting him at Knotfest 2014.</p>
<p>We quickly began writing and ended up creating the most amazing music that any of us had ever created before! Unfortunately, Sam was called away on deployment before we could play any shows, but the story doesn't end there. Despite his absence, we diligently worked on our material and practiced nearly every day until he returned. As luck would have it, that Sam was unexpectedly able to come home early from his deployment! We immediately began working on booking shows and we came across an amazing opportunity, the Battle for Knotfest 2015. Most bands would never think about having a battle for their first show, but us being the ""living on the edge"" Marines that we are, we signed up for it. The show ended up being phenomenal, despite having gear issues throughout, and we Won! Before we knew it, we were on stage in front of a massive crowd at Knotfest 2015, the same place we met Sam only a year before, and people were going insane!</p>
<p>Once that happened, tons of shows started rolling our way, and even our first sponsorship, Coldcock Whiskey. But then we realized, we need an album. So many people have been asking us for it, so here we are. Despite having a sponsorship, we are having difficulties funding our album on our own. So, we are asking for a miracle again, but this time, we want to make this an experience for all who donate to us for this album. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p><span>Imagine it’s coming up to midnight on April 19.</span></p>
<p>You are still up nervously watching election returns when the television talking heads announce Bernie Sanders has won the New York primary.  How would you feel?</p>
<p>It can happen. Sanders trails in the delegate count but is rapidly gaining in the polls. A victory in Hillary Clinton’s adopted “home state” of New York could alter the race for the Democratic nomination like no other single event.  Sanders would become the odds-on favorite in most if not all or the remaining primaries and caucuses while Clinton’ s aura of “inevitability” would be left in tatters.</p>
<p>Between now and then, we can expect corporate media to do everything it can to prop up Clinton and ignore or mischaracterize Sanders and the increasingly broad and diverse movement that supports him.</p>

<p>Titled <i>The Battle of New York</i>, this special edition will appear in an extra-large, four-page broadsheet format. It will provide information and analysis from prominent voices with compelling, original art and photography. And a proven design team. It will provide a practical, compelling and interactive means of demonstrating the surge of support especially among those under 40. It will include a diversity of voices, speaking to the communities not represented by the Democratic Party establishment. Optimistic, determined, visionary, of our time.</p>
<p><i>The Battle of New York </i>will be distributed during the week before the New York primary. We expect it to have a catalytic effect, amplifying and projecting a movement in motion. We will build on that by making the release of the special issue a news story in itself.

<p>Hello World, Friends and Neighbors. </p>
<p>First with the personal: I've been painstakingly working on a collection of songs for my solo debut album. After many years of being in bands, I went solo. It's been humbling to realize how much I achieved in the past because of working WITH great bandmates and musicians, and how much slower I am on my own. However, playing tons of solo gigs and leading a band myself has been an interesting and expansive experience and I am a stronger artist because of my successes and failures. The songs on this album are about my journeys through all kinds of love and loss, exaltations and breakdowns. </p>
<p>Artistic: These songs are influenced by emotion more than the need to satisfy and please a base. I started writing on piano and Viola and that has really transformed my writing.  </p>
<p>Social: Rarely, but thankfully often enough, I get a glimpse of what the music I make can do for other people. Folks say they sing their asses off to my previous albums, or that knowing I'm out there chugging along through the difficult helps them keep going too. We need each other! </p>
<p>Thanks for considering helping with my project. Making music is a huge part of my identity, as is being part of a community. </p>
<p>PS- Stuff can be signed if you specify! Also my photo by Brad Emmons </p>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>Raising funds is a huge challenge and I have a budget for an extremely lo fi version of the record if crowd funding doesn't work. <br/>Sometimes I get panic attacks too and that slows me down. If that happens, I'll do some deep breathing.</p>

<h3>About The Liberation Music Collective</h3>
<p>The Liberation Music Collective is a contemporary jazz ensemble dedicated to performing original compositions about social issues. The Liberation Music Collective brings a 21st-century approach to the tradition of protest music in jazz. In the words of jazz critic Neil Tesser, The Liberation Music Collective is an energetic group ""conceived in the blazing crucible of political awakening."" At the Collective, we believe that art should reflect life, and our work seeks to illustrate important cultural conversations with thought-provoking musical narrative. ​</p>

<h3>About <i>Rebel Portraiture</i>
</h3>
<p>Each song on <i>Rebel Portraiture</i> is dedicated to someone who lost their life because of who they were or what they believed in. However, this music is not a meditation on death (how dull!) These songs are illustrations of character—of decision, belief, and risk, filling a person’s life with enough power that someone seeks to extinguish it. </p>
<p>In that sense, <i>Rebel Portraiture</i> is an art gallery of martyrs. But there is another way to see it. The people we have chosen to depict – Giles Corey, students at Kent State, Noxolo Nogwaza, Berta Cáceres, journalists in the Middle East—were targeted. They were singled out to be silenced. But we refuse to accept that. We believe that you can bury a body, but you cannot bury a <i>life</i>. We hope our music stirs ripples of remembrance and helps assure that these people are not forgotten. That their messages echo for generations to come. That all who listen hear <i>our</i> message: you cannot prevail when you silence through violence and intimidation. In this way, the portraiture <i>itself</i> becomes an act of rebellion.</p>
<p>Portraits of rebels, rebellion through portraiture—whichever interpretation you choose, we hope that this music offers you courage. <i>Rebel Portraiture</i> is a tribute to those who went before us on the frontlines. They have yet to be forgotten, affirming their lives (and ours) as a worthy cause.</p>
<p>Musicians: Jess Henry, Matt Riggen, Wayne Wallace, Miró Sobrer, Brennan Johns, Ana Nelson, Sean Imboden, Alex Dura, Ellie Pruneau, Kyle Schardt, Hannah Fidler, Hannah Johnson</p>
<p>Production: Hannah Fidler, Matt Riggen, Wayne Wallace, Jake Belser (recording &amp; mixing), Kabir Sehgal (mastering &amp; liner notes)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact of Your Support</h3>
<p>Whenever the LMC goes into the studio, we believe it is imperative to pay all the musicians, engineers, and producers the professional wages they deserve for all their hard work. As you can imagine, with a big band, this adds up to a lot of money! As of right now, we have <strong>most</strong> of the funding we need <i>Rebel Portraiture</i>. However, there are some expenses that are still out of our reach. And that’s where we could use your help. </p>
<p>For our first album (<i>Siglo XXI</i>) we were able to hire a print and radio agent, all because of grants and contributions <i>from people like you</i>. Those two amazing agents got the record played on hundreds of stations worldwide, and got the word out to reporters that the music was worth writing about. Our goal is to be able to do this for <i>Rebel Portraiture</i> too.</p>
<p>This music makes more of a difference if people around the world actually listen to it and are galvanized by it. The two women we want to hire as our print and radio agents know this. They believe in our message and believe in the power of art. We all want it to be heard for the same reason--at its core, this is social music. </p>
<p>And that’s where you come in.</p>
<p>To raise the money, we’re selling the record in advance, and we’re using a “name your own price” model. No matter how much you donate, you will receive a copy of the album. We’re willing to accept whatever that might be worth to you. But if you can give a little extra, you’re not only paying for yourself to hear the album--you’re also helping other people around the world hear it.</p>

<h3>A bit about me... </h3>
<p>My name is <strong>Eric Bro</strong> but if you're reading this, that much you already know. I could give you a list of facts like, where am I from? (NH) Am I married? (Yes, to my best friend) How many kids do I have, if any? (3 ridiculously amazing daughters) Do I have any Pets? (Be honest, you really don't care about this one.) and so on. But, just give me a handful of paragraphs worth of reading and you will know the <strong>heart</strong> behind the artist and all that I am trying to accomplish.</p>
<p><strong>People are hurting.</strong> Drug abuse, mental illness, poverty, racism, homelessness, battered women and children; the list goes on and on. My desire and goal as a musician has always been to speak hope into peoples lives. I write and play to remind the listener that hopelessness is a lie. I write music that comes straight off the pages of my life or those close to me. Like so many, I have been hurt and I have hurt others. I have faced my demons head on and I have hid in the corner afraid to face the world. We all laugh... we all cry. I capture those moments in song.</p>
<p>I've been writing those songs for a very long time but it was only a few short years ago that I began playing them out at shows. I quickly found out that what I had been doing in the quiet of my own home was reaching people. What I thought was meant only for me resonated with others and I realized that I enjoyed reaching them. After two years of playing anywhere and everywhere I could, I am ready to record my first EP.</p>
<h3>A bit about this campaign...</h3>
<p>Simply put, I am asking you for help in raising the funds to do it. Making music in my living room is cheap. Having it done correctly in studio with professionals and the end product being radio ready is very costly. I need your help. If you are family or a friend, I am really counting on you. You will be the backbone of this campaign. This will be our journey together and you will be with me through the entire process. If you don't know me, I am so glad you are reading this. I need your support just as much and want you in on the journey with us. I can't overstate the gratitude I have for any and all support.   </p>
<p>I will be working with Nashville Recording Artist and Producer Jonas Woods (<strong><a href=""http://jonaswoods.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">jonaswoods.net</a></strong>) and his team of merry men and women. Jonas has worked with some of the best and I am very excited to work with him. As a matter of fact, thanks to his generosity, you can too. See the <strong>PERKS</strong> section of this campaign. Jonas is offering a couple SKYPE songwriting sessions. If you are a songwriter, this is a great opportunity to build your writing skills and help yours truly at the same time. There are only two (2) so claim them quick. Be sure to check out all the perks! It's my way of saying thank you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How the funds will be used?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Songwriting time with Jonas and others</li>
<li>Recording vocals/guitar </li>
<li>Studio time</li>
<li>Audio engineer/mixing</li>
<li>Additional musicians</li>
<li>Producer</li>
<li>Mastering</li>
<li>Artwork design and layout</li>
<li>EP Promotion</li>
<li>Travel expenses</li>
</ul>
<p>If I don't reach my goal (I know you wont let that happen), I will begin the process and complete as many songs as I can and I will continue as more funds are raised. This project will be completed.</p>
<h3>It's more than music to me...</h3>
<p>Though making music at this level is most certainly a dream of mine, that dream is not the driving force behind what I am doing. I believe in the power of music and I believe I can reach people through it. I have a heart to share what has been done in my life. I once was lost but not anymore. I have been found and I can't help but sing about it. The rest is the proverbial icing on the cake. I like icing.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Since its launch through La Clínica’s Soundcloud account, the track has gained more than 12,000 plays, around 700 likes, and 200 shares.Not so bad for a kid who came out of nowhere and was born in 1999, right?
¡TBLMKR podría ganar un Grammy! Bueno, por asociación. Frank El Médico Rodríguez fue nominado a los Grammy y Grammy Latinos por su trabajo como ingeniero de sonido en el disco “El Cartel: The Big Boss” de Daddy Yankee. Frank también confía en el talento de TBLMKR y mixeó y remasterizó su EP, así que al apoyar esta campaña podrías ser parte del futuro de un próximo gran artista.
La alianza entre TBLMKR, La Clínica Records y nuestra casa productora Cocula Films es un trabajo en conjunto donde todos estamos aportando de nuestras ganas, tiempo y esfuerzo para crear un producto donde no estamos ganando un solo peso, pero sí ganamos en proyectar el talento local con el buen trabajo que merece. La idea es que esta alianza no solo se quede aquí, sino que gracias a este proyecto contemos con los recursos para apoyar más artistas emergentes y podamos crecer juntos.

¡Viva México! No solo en Monterrey, sino en todo México hay un sinfín de artistas con un talento enorme que no siempre pueden llevar a cabo sus proyectos por falta de presupuesto. Apoyar nuestra campaña es una apuesta por el futuro de todos esos artistas con los que queremos seguir trabajando y que no solo se queden en Monterrey o en México, sino que puedan expandirse a todos lados.
1. TBLMKR could win a Grammy!!! Well, by association. Frank El Médico Rodríguez was nominated to the Grammy’s and Latin Grammy’s for his sound engineer work in Daddy Yankee’s album “El Cartel: The Big Boss”. We’re talking about this is the guy who blindly trusts in TBLMKR and mixed and mastered his upcoming EP. So, supporting this campaign you could be part of the future of a very big artist.​2. The alliance between TBLMKR, La Clínica Records, and our production company Cocula Films, is a team work where all of us are putting our time and effort to create something without any financial gain. We believe in this young artist and other great talents that might not have the resources to expose their work, but with projects like these, they could have a chance to make it out there, be heard and be seen.3. Viva México!! There’s a huge amount of talent not just in Monterrey, but everywhere in México. These unknown artists are a great example of this country’s amazing cultural variety, but not many can succeed in their projects because of financial problems. Supporting our campaign it’s a bet on the young people we would love to work with and to help them expand all over the world.  Arriba, en el video introductorio a esta agradable campaña, les explicamos de qué tratará la historia de “Que lo bailen”. Pero aquí les van algunos detalles de producción:Up there in our introduction video for this campaign, we explain what’s the deal with the videoclip’s story. But here you’ll find some details about the production process behind all of it:El rodaje será en dos días. El primer día para cubrir todas las escenas de fiesta y descontrol, y el segundo día para grabar el ritual de resurrección y baile. Para estos dos días necesitamos transporte, alimentación, pagar algunos permisos y refrigerios del cast & crew.Filming will take two days. One day for the party scenes, and a second day for the dancing resurrection ritual. For all that we’ll need transportation, food, permit fees and snacks for the cast & crew.La cámara que queremos usar es una Scarlet M-X de la familia de RED. De esta manera tendremos todo el material en 4K y listo para modificar a nuestro antojo en edición. Para manejarla contamos con la mano experta de Juansa Ávalos, director de fotografía consagrado de Monterrey y México. (PD: ¡Gracias por seguir con nosotros, Juansa!)The videocamera we want to use is the beautiful Scarlet-MX from RED. This way, we’ll have all the footage in 4K, ready to be preciously edited to our wishes. To handle this bad girl, we have the expert hands of Juansa Ávalos, one of the best DPs in the country. Thank you, Juansa!El diseño de producción estará a cargo de los chicos de La Causa, un estudio creativo de Monterrey que ha estado a cargo de proyectos artísticos desde el diseño de la identidad, hasta montar sets completos en cortometrajes y videoclips.Production Design will lay in the talented team of La Causa, a creative studio in Monterrey with several years of experience. Y también se unió a nuestro proyecto Fantasma Films, una casa productora de Monterrey que ha trabajado en proyectos de artistas como Cuatro Sobre La Luna, Morenito De Fuego y Teen Flirt, el festival musical Pa'l Norte, y la cadena de supermercados H-E-B.We’ll also will be working with Fantasma Films, the great production company in Monterrey responsible for some of the best music videos, shortfilms, and TV spots of the country. Having clients like Teen Flirt, music festival Pa’l Norte, and supermarket chain H-E-B.El maquillaje de los chicos y los minions para que den miedo y parezcan de ultratumba estará a cargo de Grecia Silva, una gran maquillista de efectos especiales de Monterrey.Our trusted make up artist’s name is Grecia Silva, and she will give the dead-look to our three anti-heroes and the dancing minions.Finalmente, la dirección y co-producción estará a cargo de Luis Machín y nuestro equipo de Cocula Films. Somos una agencia nueva de Monterrey que nos enfocaremos en crear contenido creativo y original desde México para todas partes.

SONGBOOKS TO A GLOBAL ONLINE PLATFORMAfter offering as free download since 2002 our original songbooks used in singing circles worldwide, presenting a total of 775 traditional and modern popular and spiritual songs with chords and rythm information, Songfisher now has a new vision: creating an online platform for the global Circle Singing community.MANY SONGS, MANY BOOKS TO CARRY ALONG... NOW, IMAGINE:
A “night-time” tablet/smartphone-friendly version of all 5 published songbooks
Accessing any song in a  global online searchable database containing all existing songs, and also updated regularly with new songs with texts, chords, etc..., all indexed with searchable tags for genres, etc...
All songs being approved in their original version by the songwriters
Creating and export your own custom compilations designed around a specific genre or theme, or for a particular occasion (circle, workshop, concert, etc...)
Listening to each song with one click
Connecting online with others members of the singing community
A calendar of circle singing related events and festivals, as well as many other features which will be developed in the future
 ​ WHY DO WE NEED FUNDING?Until now, all Songfisher's operations have been resourced through volunteer work. Through this crowdfunding campaign we are looking forward to resource the main elements required to realise this project: graphic design, web development, administration and co-ordination with the songwriters and the various communities, etc...To complete all 3 phases of the development of this platform will require €50k. We will complete as much as possible according to the funding available.Songfisher's mission is to offer a service to the singing community and is not for profit. If you have any query about the detail of how the money raised will be spent, please contact us at music@songfisher.orgIn the long term, Songfisher.org will become financially sustainable through subscriptions to affordable membership to website services, user donations and if necessary advertising.   HOW WE PLAN TO MANIFEST THIS VISIONHere are the detail of how we plan to roll out this new project, through 3 main phases:PHASE 1
Redesign and update all first 4 songbooks to the higher standard of last book “Ibiza Sagrada” 
Compile all 5 songbooks into a single pdf version with global index
Produce pdf “night-time” tablet/smartphone-friendly versions of all 5 songbooks and compilation 
Develop themed compilations such as Medicine Songs and Mantras
PHASE 2
Re-develop the website www.songfisher.org

Develop a searchable database to contain and index all songs with texts, chords, etc...
BASIC FEATURES OF THE  ONLINE SEARCHABLE DATABASE:
Search for, listen to and see songs from the songbooks on a global web platform containing songs from many different cultures, traditions and languages: Mantras, Rainbow, Native, Santo Daime, Umbanda, Hebrew, etc...
Each songs contains information about the artist/songwriter, lyrics, chords, key, tempo and links to the artist's website
Search tool for songs by artist, title, genre, language, songbook, etc...
Artists can introduce their songs (lyrics, chords, links to music) to a wider audience of listeners, musicians, seminar/workshop facilitators and singing circles
Compile and export your own personalised collection of songs as a printable online songbook which can be used in events, workshops, singing circles or for musicians/singers to study new songs
Artists can link their songs to places where they can sell and promote the songs such as Bandcamp, YouTube, iTunes, Sound Cloud, Melobee etc...
ADVANCED FEATURES:
Communicate with artists and users of the app, write comments and feedback through a chat/ forum platform
""Like"" your favourite songs and get info on other users favourites
Artists: announce new songs and new additions in your song books to all users or to a selected group of users
Artists: get statistics on songs audience and their location, to help promote concerts and events
PHASE 3
Further develop the website to better serve the global community: events calendars, forums, etc...
Open the online platform to other songbook producers (Ciranda, Sacred Valley, SoL, etc...), in order to feature their songs in the database, so that their are available in the Songfisher format (these songs from other books from other communities will retain their same song numbers as in the original books, which will remain usable of course)
Develop melodical notations for all songs
 SONGFISHER HAS THE FULL SUPPORT OF SONGWRITERS AND SINGING CIRCLES INTERNATIONALLY.The following musicians, songwriters and circle facilitators have all given their approval and expressed their support for this project (by alphabetical order):Adrian Freedman, Ale de Maria, Alexia Chellun, Amu, Andrea & Amin, Arnaldo Herrara/Boveda Celeste, Ayla, Carioca, Carlos, Chris Mancini, Chris Orange, Danit, Darpan, Diego Palma, Fantuzzi, Guy Lacroix, Heera, Ilona, Kuauthli, Laor, Loli, Lorna, Lucidia/Raphael, Lulu & Mischka, MaureenJi, Murray Kyle, Nick Barbachano, Omer, Oscar, Paloma Devi, Rainer Scheurenbrand, RaviJi, Rob/Rayo, Ryan Whitewolf, Shimshai, Tao, Tom Tom Lev, Vismay and many more.We already have the support of the following communities:Byron Community (Australia), Ubud Community (Bali, Indonesia), Alto Paraiso Community (Brazil), Mae de Agua (Brazil), Pacha Mama Community (Costa Rica), Miami Community (US), Ibiza Family (Spain), Sacred Valley Tribe (Peru), Eternal Heart Tribe (UK), Sol Community (Costa Rica), Ciranda (Brazil), Israel Families, Hawaii Families as well as people from Kaxinawá, Yawanawa, Huichol and other indigenous communities.THE POWER OF SINGING TOGETHERWe truly believe that singing as a group is a key factor in creating a more harmonious world: chanting songs form various cultures contributes to creating a true brotherhood and sisterhood globally, and group singing has been used to promote cohesion and harmony in native tribes and societies since ancient times. Today, science also acknowledges the psychological and health benefits of the practice of music and singing, especially in a group, as shown in this published research by Mona Lisa Chanda and Daniel J.

<h3>Who am I and why am I recording an EP?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A small accident on November 30, 2013 led to what is by far the most difficult year of my life. I incurred a terrible concussion that made me very sensitive to light and sound, so much so that I had to stay in the dark and wear earplugs a lot for months and months on end. That was very, very, very frustrating as a singer/songwriter and musician. To top that off, I had very bad anxiety and some depression, because I could hardly do anything. There were many occasions when I'd start feeling better and try to do something simple as washing dishes or being on the computer or driving and then I'd get a setback. So I was pretty much traumatized by what I was going through.</p>
<p>But, thank God, He still enabled me to hear melodies and write songs in my head. He even gave me dreams where I'd hear beautiful music or me singing. That was a great encouragement to me. And even though that may be the most difficult period of my life so far - it would eventually take about a year and 9 months before I'd be well enough to work at least part time - I am very grateful for the experience. Not only did it teach me to value silence, but songs were born out of it which I believe will be an encouragement to others. Just like it says in II Corinthians 1:4, ""He comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others."" (NLT)</p>
<p>These are songs that not only voiced my cry and prayers to God for help and healing, but also speak the truth. When times got confusing, I had to remind myself of the truth to find peace in the midst of the storm I was going through. A song was also written as a thank you to friends and family that came along side me in my time of greatest need.</p>
<p>The working title of this project is <strong>""My Future Is Alive""</strong> as that is the hope that God gave me and I believe it is the same hope He wants me to convey to those who are going through difficulties, including you. No matter what you're going through in life, your future is still alive in Christ.</p>
<p>Most of the songs in the EP will come from what was born out of my struggle to get better from the post-concussion syndrome. There may be one or two in there that were written before that, but they are all going to work towards the theme of <strong>My Future Is Alive.</strong></p>
<p>If this vision resonates with you and you would like to help me encourage people with the songs God has entrusted to me, you can partner with me in a couple of ways. First, pray that the right songs will be chosen for the project, the production and recording will go excellently, and that the Holy Spirit will use the songs mightily to heal and deliver. Second, pledge an amount towards the project and enjoy the perks when they become available.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Is Needed to Make This Happen &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The estimated budget for the project is $6000. Around $1000 has already been raised. So I'm setting the goal of $5000. Donations made in cash save 8%, which is what it will cost to run it through Indiegogo. This budgeted amount covers the recording, production, mastering, online distribution, registration for copyright, CD duplication, cost of perks, mailing and marketing. The aim is not just to record 5 songs, but to get these songs in the hands and ears of those who need it. That is why marketing is included in the budget.</p>
<p>If we reach $7000 total, that will enable me to add 2 songs to the EP. Lord willing, it will get to that.</p>

A small accident on November 30, 2013 led to what is by far the most difficult year of my life. I incurred a terrible concussion that made me very sensitive to light and sound, so much so that I had to stay in the dark and wear earplugs a lot for months and months on end. That was very, very, very frustrating as a singer/songwriter and musician. To top that off, I had very bad anxiety and some depression, because I could hardly do anything. There were many occasions when I'd start feeling better and try to do something simple as washing dishes or being on the computer or driving and then I'd get a setback. So I was pretty much traumatized by what I was going through.
But, thank God, He still enabled me to hear melodies and write songs in my head. He even gave me dreams where I'd hear beautiful music or me singing. That was a great encouragement to me. And even though that may be the most difficult period of my life so far - it would eventually take about a year and 9 months before I'd be well enough to work at least part time - I am very grateful for the experience. Not only did it teach me to value silence, but songs were born out of it which I believe will be an encouragement to others. Just like it says in II Corinthians 1:4, ""He comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others."" (NLT)
These are songs that not only voiced my cry and prayers to God for help and healing, but also speak the truth. When times got confusing, I had to remind myself of the truth to find peace in the midst of the storm I was going through. A song was also written as a thank you to friends and family that came along side me in my time of greatest need.
The working title of this project is ""My Future Is Alive"" as that is the hope that God gave me and I believe it is the same hope He wants me to convey to those who are going through difficulties, including you. No matter what you're going through in life, your future is still alive in Christ.
Most of the songs in the EP will come from what was born out of my struggle to get better from the post-concussion syndrome. There may be one or two in there that were written before that, but they are all going to work towards the theme of My Future Is Alive.
If this vision resonates with you and you would like to help me encourage people with the songs God has entrusted to me, you can partner with me in a couple of ways.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi folks, I'm Jeff Przech. Thanks for stopping by this page. What you'll see here is 100% me. No acting, no 'sales pitch', just myself. I strive to be authentic in my music and this campaign will be no different. Thanks for coming this far and I hope you'll keep reading!</p>
<p>To explain all this, I think it's best to start with the 5 W's:</p>
<ul>
<li>WHO: Jeff Przech (me) and band (The Outfit)</li>
<li>WHAT: Our new record that we're recording now</li>
<li>WHERE: Well, we live and are recording in Connecticut, but it's music so the world is our target audience.</li>
<li>WHEN: Now! Today!</li>
<li>WHY: Because you can be a part of this process with us. Because you can get some really cool things for your pledge. Because you love good music and support those making it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're not simply asking for a handout. Instead, we're inviting everyone to join us in the music making process. We hope you'll share some of the ride with us. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Why</h3>
<p>Truthfully, the usual budget for a record like this is far more than we're asking and can even leak into the six figures. We're doing this on a tight budget, but that does NOT mean we're doing this halfway. We have a good friend with a great studio and we're recording a majority of the record live in the same room. That means very few overdubs. What you'll hear is the four of us playing together in the same room. In addition to helping us on recording costs, it's an excellent vibe to make a record and has been used by some of our favorite artists. We've already got most of the record tracked and are thrilled with the way it's sounding so far. We're trying to raise a total of $7500. Here's what all that will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio time for recording</li>
<li>Mixing &amp; mastering the final record</li>
<li>Production costs, including the CD pressing </li>
<li>Licensing fees for the one cover song on the record </li>
<li>Distribution costs (for physical CD and digital outlets - iTunes, Spotify, etc.)</li>
<li>Printing high quality T-shirts</li>
<li>IndieGogo &amp; credit card fees</li>
<li>Promotion of the new record, to get it heard</li>
<li>Publicist/PR professional to help with promotion</li>
<li>Packaging &amp; postage</li>
</ul>
<p>If we're unable to reach our goal, some of these things will fall by the wayside, starting with the publicity and promotion. There's no sense paying for promo for a record that's not finished, of course. But, we don't want to make a record that no one will know about or hear either. If we're able to somehow exceed our goal, then we'll be able to do other things, like more promotion focusing on the digital world, and perhaps even shoot a music video. Anything is possible!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>In addition to being part of this project with us, there are a bunch of great exclusive items and experiences available depending on your pledge. Remember, these are NOT donations, and we are not a charity! Everyone who pledges their support will get something for it. There are the usual things like CD's and T-shirts, and also exclusive things like a round of golf with me or even one of my guitars. You can also have the opportunity to have your name listed in the liner notes of the record and even be credited as an executive producer. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This record is 'old school' in a lot of ways. We're recording it live in the studio. The music itself is, in my opinion, the kind you don't hear too much anymore. I'm not going to compare it to any particular artist - you the listener can do that for yourselves - but it'll be pretty clear who the influences are. We believe this record and these songs will help fill a void. There are a ton of music choices out there these days. The music business is changing daily and it's a far cry from the one many of us remember. Technology has allowed anyone who wants to become a recording artist the chance to do so.</p>
<p>However, technology has also led to streaming, which is the primary way, sometimes the ONLY way, people consume music these days. I won't bore you with the specifics, but suffice it to say when someone streams a song by an artist, that artist will only receive fractions of a penny for him/herself.</p>
<p>So what? My point is, I'm not getting rich off of this record and have no expectations of doing so. In fact, it's safe to say I probably won't even make a profit from it at all. And honestly, I don't care! I'm not doing this to make money or a living. I'm doing this because I love it and I need to. It's my passion and these songs are a huge part of who and what I am. Your support and pledge will help ensure that these songs get out there. I believe it's good music. I believe people who hear it will agree. But it must be made in order to be heard. Where the music goes from there? Who knows? But we'll never know unless this record gets made, right?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p> “There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.”</p>
<p>Quite honestly, the challenge will come if we fail and don't meet our goal. Things need to be done and those things have a price. This is the reality of being an independent musician these days. We have not held back on the recording. In my mind, good enough is not good enough. That's my attitude about this entire project and meeting our goal will guarantee that nothing about this record is just 'good enough'.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We can't do this by ourselves. If you aren't in a place where you can comfortably contribute to the making of this record, I completely understand. But, you can still help! The best way is by <strong>sharing this campaign via email and social media using the IndieGoGo Share Tools by the ""BACK IT"" button the top of the page! </strong>Any and all help is much appreciated.</p>

Hi folks, I'm Jeff Przech. Thanks for stopping by this page. What you'll see here is 100% me. No acting, no 'sales pitch', just myself. I strive to be authentic in my music and this campaign will be no different. Thanks for coming this far and I hope you'll keep reading!

What We Need & Why
Truthfully, the usual budget for a record like this is far more than we're asking and can even leak into the six figures. We're doing this on a tight budget, but that does NOT mean we're doing this halfway. We have a good friend with a great studio and we're recording a majority of the record live in the same room.

Production costs, including the CD pressing 
Licensing fees for the one cover song on the record 
Distribution costs (for physical CD and digital outlets - iTunes, Spotify, etc.)
Printing high quality T-shirts
IndieGogo & credit card fees
Promotion of the new record, to get it heard
Publicist/PR professional to help with promotion
Packaging & postage

If we're unable to reach our goal, some of these things will fall by the wayside, starting with the publicity and promotion. There's no sense paying for promo for a record that's not finished, of course. But, we don't want to make a record that no one will know about or hear either. If we're able to somehow exceed our goal, then we'll be able to do other things, like more promotion focusing on the digital world, and perhaps even shoot a music video. Anything is possible!

What You Get
In addition to being part of this project with us, there are a bunch of great exclusive items and experiences available depending on your pledge. Remember, these are NOT donations, and we are not a charity! Everyone who pledges their support will get something for it. There are the usual things like CD's and T-shirts, and also exclusive things like a round of golf with me or even one of my guitars. You can also have the opportunity to have your name listed in the liner notes of the record and even be credited as an executive producer. 
The Impact
This record is 'old school' in a lot of ways. We're recording it live in the studio. The music itself is, in my opinion, the kind you don't hear too much anymore. I'm not going to compare it to any particular artist - you the listener can do that for yourselves - but it'll be pretty clear who the influences are. We believe this record and these songs will help fill a void. There are a ton of music choices out there these days. The music business is changing daily and it's a far cry from the one many of us remember. Technology has allowed anyone who wants to become a recording artist the chance to do so.
However, technology has also led to streaming, which is the primary way, sometimes the ONLY way, people consume music these days. I won't bore you with the specifics, but suffice it to say when someone streams a song by an artist, that artist will only receive fractions of a penny for him/herself.
So what? My point is, I'm not getting rich off of this record and have no expectations of doing so. In fact, it's safe to say I probably won't even make a profit from it at all. And honestly, I don't care! I'm not doing this to make money or a living. I'm doing this because I love it and I need to. It's my passion and these songs are a huge part of who and what I am. Your support and pledge will help ensure that these songs get out there. I believe it's good music. I believe people who hear it will agree. But it must be made in order to be heard. Where the music goes from there? Who knows? But we'll never know unless this record gets made, right?

Challenges
 “There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.”
Quite honestly, the challenge will come if we fail and don't meet our goal. Things need to be done and those things have a price. This is the reality of being an independent musician these days. We have not held back on the recording. In my mind, good enough is not good enough. That's my attitude about this entire project and meeting our goal will guarantee that nothing about this record is just 'good enough'.

Other Ways You Can Help
We can't do this by ourselves. If you aren't in a place where you can comfortably contribute to the making of this record, I completely understand. But, you can still help! The best way is by sharing this campaign via email and social media using the IndieGoGo Share Tools by the ""BACK IT"" button the top of the page! Any and all help is much appreciated.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It has been nearly 6 months since the release of our début single 'Better From You', and in that time the band has refrained from an immediate follow up in order to prepare, develop and create a series of releases aimed at this coming summer. The consistent rehearsing, recording and production has seen the band evolve into something that our first single can no longer adequately characterise, with every new song expanding the group's songwriting capabilities, drive, and creative identity. We are now ready to break our silence and make some new noise.</p>
<p>Our goal is to finally take our fanbase on a journey through these last 6 months, and to show the world who we are, what we've become, and why we believe in Iridesce. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Targets</h3>
<p>The 3 songs that are scheduled for release this coming summer are only a fraction of the new material we've been working on, and will act as pillars to introduce Iridesce's developing sound. These singles are there to show the array of moods and atmospheres that have come to define our group's sonic identity, thereby re-inventing the band we were in 'Better From You'. To enable this successful evolution, we have a few key targets that we are aiming to meet. This is what the funds from our campaign will help us achieve:</p>
<p>A) Mixing/Mastering/Production of the 3rd single </p>
<p>B) Recording &amp; Production of the other new material we've written - this enables us to structure the second wave of releases we are currently drafting for autumn 2017</p>
<p>C) Music Video for the 3rd single </p>
<p>D) Live sound equipment - this will be a bundle of sound engineering equipment that will help the band guarantee a great live sound, and bring the richness and depth we work into our records onto the stage with us </p>
<p>E) Live show design - as well as re-inventing Iridesce's sound, the band are in the production stages of crafting an entirely new live show (containing only 2 out of the 8 older songs the band were touring when 'Better From You' was released). Live is the environment where we truly want our music to live in, so investing in this campaign will help the band present to you the exact experience and energy we feel when playing our songs. </p>
<p>F) Promotion and advertisement to showcase and support the new releases and live dates </p>

<p>Any and all support is appreciated! We cant wait to show you what we've become, and hope we can share our story with you!</p>

<p><strong>Dear friends, wellcome to my Indiegogo campaign page!</strong></p>
<p>My name is <strong>Joca Perpignan</strong> - percussionist, singer and composer, from Rio de Janeiro, living in Israel and I am here to present my new project: my third album of original music, and the first one exclusively of Sambas!</p>

<p>In order to produce this project I called some of the top samba musicians in Rio de Janeiro, led by the master cavaquinho player and producer <strong>Alceu Maia</strong>! </p>

<h3><u>Can I be honest?</u></h3>
<p>Let's be real, this is always the hardest part, talking about yourself and asking for money. I just wanted to get that out of the way up front. </p>
<p>Since I was in middle school I knew I wanted to create music. I never had aspirations of becoming some big pop star or being in the magazines but I knew I wanted to create music that mattered. As I grew older and confronted the reality of other peoples opinions, my own self-esteem, and confidence, and my lack of faith in myself I put that hope aside. I regained it from time to time, I even attempted to record and release a project nearly 5 years ago and failed. I began to realize that all of those experiences from trying to failing, loving and hating myself, believing and not believing weren't isolated to just me. I realized that we as humans share many common experiences and I had the opportunity to express that in music form and thats exactly what I did and still do. </p>
<p>Creating music for me is beyond bringing a dream to reality. It’s about relating, connecting, grieving, loving, and journeying with others in melodies and languages laced with honesty and hope. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Lynn Hadley-Gillitzer’s first Album a mixture of country/blues and jazz with a little rock thrown in.  I have been singing my whole life, Music is my Passion, my Paradise.</p>
<p>Music heals, and brings such joy to our lives, I am raising funds for my first Album,  and at the same time hope to bring to awareness to those who suffer from mental illnesses; coping with everyday life and It’s challenges.  People need a way to escape and heal.  Many wear masks to disguise their pain, and are left adrift at sea alone to their own devices. We must come together, to help unmask the stigma of mental illnesses.  Below is a meandering of my story, with my song titles embedded within it.</p>
<p>I have traveled many roads while enjoying the adventures of motherhood, all the while quietly dreaming my path would lead back to music.</p>
<p>Within the meanderings of life, I have many <strong><i>Reflection</i></strong><i>s </i>and have stood by<strong> <i>Still Waters </i></strong>and dove into the deep to try to solve the many mysteries of life, only to have been lead down <strong><i>Mystery Street</i></strong>  trying  to understanding the many twist and turns that life brings.</p>
<p>I have been left<strong> <i>Breathless</i></strong> by the joys and experiences of parenthood, marriage and friendships, at the same time felt the sadness of loss.  The bitter sweetness of life.  These experiences have left their mark, leaving many <strong><i>Scrapes and Bruises</i> </strong>along the way, music has always lead me back to the harmonious melodies of <strong><i>Paradise Alley</i></strong>, while dealing with my own depression and anxiety,  my escape, the gift that lifts me up and brings me back home.</p>
<p>I spent so much time watching my children grow, felt the love only mothers know, the love <strong><i>Mothers and</i> <i>Daughters</i></strong>  feel. I have seen the sands of time slip through the glass, only to awaken to feel the <strong><i>Winds of</i> <i>Change</i></strong> at my feet, and see through new eyes, the love that shines through their experiences, experiences through <strong><i>Sophie’s Eyes</i> </strong>and with renewed vision see,  realize <strong><i>It’s Never Too Late</i>.</strong> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The adventure continues, and I hope you will join me on my journey, and help me raise funds to pay for the many talented and dedicated musicians that have graciously help produce and play on my Album.</p>
<p>Beth Kille</p>
<p>Dana Perry</p>
<p>Jenna Joanis</p>
<p>Shawnie Marks</p>
<p>Rin Ribble</p>
<p>Dan Kennedy</p>
<p>Nikki Wentworth Allbaugh</p>
<p>I also need to pay for production costs, audio engineering, graphic design, photography, and CD mastering.</p>
<p>My journey would not be possible with Beth Kille, who has invested countless hours to help breathe life into my songs. I have been able to collaborate with many others on this project as well, including songwriters  Elizabeth Petty(Mystery Street), Jacob Peetz(It's Never to late) Elizabeth Gillitzer(Reflections), and my fellow Ladies Rock Campers, Sarah Chrysler, Heather Williams, Judi Alvarado, Lynda Mcafee who cowrote ""Winds of Change"" with me.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Finally, it is my hope with this album will continue to always bring awareness of Mental Health, and the importance of recognizing; being vigilant to those who suffer from mental illnesses, and to those who have taken their own lives.  One of the songs <i>Still Waters</i> is a testimony to my brother, who took his own life, and to a multitude of others who have done the same.</p>
<p>People with mental illness often wear a mask, we often do not even know those who are suffering, but if we can erase the stigma, so people can remove their masks and get the help they need.</p>
<p>Music heals, it has helped me grieve the loss of my brother, my mother and also my father, and not to mention so many other facets of my life.  Music is my paradise I escape to so I may reflect on life and find the peace love and happiness I so long for.</p>
<p>Any extra funds I raise will be donated to the MAMA's and Girls Rock Camp Madison, organizations that put instruments into the hands of children, and foster the love of music to new generations. </p>

<p> </p> <h3>Here I Am Again</h3>
<p>Hello my friends, it's Rick again.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed hearing some of my music in the videos above.</p>
<p>Let me be up front with you, <strong>this is my second attempt to fund this album.</strong> Last time we raised about half of what I needed so now I'm attempting to raise the other half.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Let Me Tell You about This Album</h3>
<p>I’ve already finished recording this album with my super-talented friends at <a href=""http://oldbearstudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Old Bear Studio</strong> </a>in Buffalo, New York. <i>Chris Hoisington</i>, of <a href=""http://brothersmcclurg.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Brothers McClurg</strong></a>, produced the project and he has been an amazing collaborator to work with.  We completed the recording of the album on the week of March 12th.</p>
<p>This album is important to me for a variety of reasons. One big reason is that I have the honor of releasing a never before published song on this album by one of my musical heroes, the late <strong>Rich Mullins.</strong> The song is called Thunder, and I love it so much that I decided to give the album the same title.</p>
<p><strong><i>The album is much more than music by Rich Mullins though</i></strong>.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years I feel like I have been through some large peaks and valleys in life. The songs I'm putting on this album are songs of worship but they are also songs that deal with hard things I have been through with family, my friends, and my church.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the songs on this album deal with hard life issues like death of loved ones, miscarriages, and painful human struggles we all encounter. </li>
<li>Certain songs deal with rich but difficult theological matters like the contemplative prayer, the Trinity and loving our enemies.</li>
<li>Some of the songs are just some fun proclamations of joy designed to help the church rejoice and sing together.</li>
</ul>
<p>My hope is that the music on this album will not only have the highest musical quality, but that it will be a tool used by God to draw worship from His people no matter what circumstance of life we find ourselves in. </p>
<h3><strong>What Do I Need?</strong></h3>
<p>To meet the financial needs for this recording, we needed to raise $5200 dollars more. However, just prior to our launch a $500 came in so now we only need to raise $4700 total to meet the recording budget. There are many complex aspects that go into a live recording like this.</p>
<p>The money will be used to pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio time  </li>
<li>The musicians </li>
<li>The engineers </li>
<li>The videographers</li>
<li>The photographers</li>
<li>Pre and post production expenses</li>
<li>The Producer</li>
</ul>
<h3>Good News</h3>
<p>With God's help, I've already raised over $5000 dollars and with generosity of good people like you I know we can raise the rest in 45 days.</p>
<p>Your contributions to this campaign will ensure that I don't have to take out a large loan for this project thus keeping my family out of financial hardship. These days you really can't depend on albums to pay for themselves after they release, especially as an independent artist, so your contributions literally allow me to continue making music now and in the future.</p>
<strong>Perks For Giving</strong><ul><li><h3><strong>Album Pre-Orders</strong></h3></li></ul>
<p>Every donation is greatly appreciated, but donations $30 dollars and above receive two tracks from the album immediately, a digital download of the entire album when it releases, and an autographed physical copy of the CD.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>“When we talk about ‘classic’ jazz, I think what we really mean is timeless jazz. Music that not only endures for decades, but remains relevant. This is where E. J. Decker comes in. With  </i><strong>Bluer Than Velvet: The Prysock Project</strong><i> he goes deep into the timeless sound of Arthur Prysock, carefully choosing a repertoire that is at once classic and fresh. </i><strong>The Prysock Project</strong><i> breathes life into songs that have obviously made a lasting impression on this vocalist. </i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Having been fortunate enough to watch this recording project move from concept to final tracks, I’ve been reminded of the determination and commitment it takes to be an artist, to have a desire to honor a legacy, and to jump in on your own to make it happen. I’ve listened to it again and again, each time hearing another nuance, another nod, another moment of appreciation for the groundwork laid by an often under sung classic singer. And I hear compassion, heartache, and humor in this music. This is why it’s worthy of your time…to listen, to support, and to help bring the creative process to full fruition. </i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>That, and the music is just so d*mned good.”</i> <strong>—Claudia Russell, KSDS Public Radio 88.3 fm, San Diego, CA</strong></p>
<p>This is the level of response that <i><strong>Bluer Than Velvet: The Prysock Project</strong></i>  has engendered from those in the industry with whom I've spoken about it and those few who have had the chance to hear it. This album's low-note tastiness and its refocusing on human connection in jazz is why I'm making this effort to reach the wider industry. I've started this funding campaign because many more taste makers than I can reach alone have expressed interest in hearing it and judging for themselves. We need the assistance of promotions professionals &amp; you can help with that!</p>
<p><strong>WHO'S ON THIS ALBUM?</strong><br/>I'm joined on this session by some of New York's top players: <strong>Claire Daly</strong>, <i>baritone sax</i>; <strong>Chris Bergson</strong>, <i>guitar</i>; <strong>Elizabeth Frascoia</strong>, <i>trombone</i>; <strong>Les Kurtz</strong>, <i>piano</i>; <strong>Saadi Zain</strong>, <i>bass</i>; <strong>Tom Melito</strong>, <i>drums</i>. We've sought to channel the lush, romantic quality of Prysock's sound to make music of today that has a deeply human heartbeat. The first few reviews I've seen intimate that we may very well have succeeded.</p>
<p><strong>HOW I KNOW ARTHUR PRYSOCK</strong><br/>I was a 17-year-old kid when I first encountered Arthur Prysock.</p>
<p>An AM radio played softly behind me where I was working one night. Suddenly I heard this stunning, deep voice behind me, telling me the story of his love gone wrong. A powerful man’s voice, standing out from the string of tenor men’s voices and women’s voices I’d long stopped listening to that day. I stopped everything, listening as he told me his tale of woe and I waited for the DJ to name him. It was Arthur Prysock. I suddenly was a fan. And he became a major influence on my singing.</p>
<p><strong>HOW YOU MAY KNOW ARTHUR PRYSOCK</strong><br/><i>“Here’s to good friends, tonight is kind of special…”</i> <strong>—Arthur Prysock, for Löwenbräu beer.</strong></p>
<p>In the ’70s, with his recording career in eclipse, Prysock reached his widest audience, ironically, as the ubiquitous soundtrack to “good times” with his famous beer jingle — arguably the best beer jingle ever made:</p>
<p> </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ztXr_WLrKvc?rel=0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY THE ALBUM</strong><br/>The wondrously happy look on people’s faces when they hear I'm honoring Prysock is a big motivator. Half the people I meet know of him and are elated, as if being reminded of an old friend. Half of the rest don’t know him by name — but when I sing the beer jingle, their eyes light up. And the remainder are simply in for a treat!</p>
<p><strong>HIS INFLUENCE</strong><br/>By the early '90s, after years in folk &amp; rock, I’d moved to jazz, listening to everyone intently. Prysock jumped to the fore of my research, telling stories of real people that simply were more honest and direct than the work of other singers I heard; he was steadfast in sharing his love, joy or heartbreak to a specific person in each song. The more I listened, the more I realized that’s how you go about things. Sadly I also found those elements were diminishing in an increasingly academic music. I made sure to insert that Prysock honesty, along with songs of his I connected to, into my earlier albums.</p>
<p>I studied briefly with jazz great <strong>Mark Murphy</strong> and he once asked me my influences. I named a few singers, but as I mentioned Prysock, he jumped and his face lit up, a reaction I’d soon get from many others. “Prysock?! Prysock! You <i>have</i> to do a Prysock tribute!” I resisted a bit, but he insisted over time.</p>
<p>And with <i><strong>Bluer Than Velvet</strong></i>, we’ve produced what I believe is both a fitting tribute and a very human album. There are songs here that only Prysock recorded. There are Songbook tunes with which he had pop or R&amp;B hits. As his discography numbers hundreds of tracks, there are many songs here that he did that have been in my gig book for years. We include a few songs that he most likely never sang — but where, to my mind, you can hear the unmistakable influence on me of Prysock's approach or the influence of the amazing arrangements that always surrounded him. I then rearranged the whole collection and formed my own approach to his consistent lesson of connecting with each person across the speakers.</p>
<p>I’ve put nine years into this project — not just getting it out but making it the best it could be. I certainly hope that Arthur would feel honored. I believe Mark would be pleased that his insistence bore fruit.</p>
<p>Now I ask your help in bringing this long-overdue celebration of Arthur Prysock to the greater jazz audience.</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE'RE GOING TO PROMOTE THIS ALBUM</strong><br/><strong>My fundraising goal is $6,000 to build the national promotions campaign this album needs.</strong> That helps cover the fees of the stellar publicist and radio promotion teams I’ve assembled, who are already laying the groundwork in their arenas.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Press: Chris DiGirolamo, Two for the Show Media — </strong>has run successful press campaigns for Eddie Gomez, Steve Gadd, Donny McCaslin, Mike Longo, Jay Leonhart, Wycliffe Gordon, The Persuasions, Dafnis Prieto, Tierney Sutton, Edie Brickell, and scores of others.</li>
<li>
<strong>Radio: Kate Smith, Kate Smith Promotions — </strong>has achieved extensive radio airplay for a long list of jazz luminaries, including Dave Stryker, Nnenna Freelon, Steve Slagle, Nancy Kelly and Howard Johnson, as well as promoting Wayne Wallace's recently Grammy nominated album. She also did a stunning job on my previous album, <i><strong>A Job of Work (Tales of the Great Recession)</strong></i>, helping me forge strong relationships with radio programmers and on-air hosts around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything we receive above our goal goes to the postage for the more than 600 top jazz journalists and radio programmers to whom we’re reaching out — a cost that’s risen dramatically since my last album.</p>
<p>For the nine years we’ve worked on this project, we’ve borne the entire cost of this production, which as you can imagine has been sizable — but your pre-order of this album now and/or any donation you can give will allow us to take that critical final step to reach its broadest fair hearing, a process which is already beginning…</p>
<p><strong>THE EARLY RETURNS</strong><br/>In step with the Russell quote above, here’s a taste of the reaction this album is now receiving as industry people hear early pre-release copies:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""Hitting it out of the park here in the classiest of ways, Decker isn’t aping Prysock so much as he is following in his footsteps. One of the class acts of the past, this is a smoking way to make sure he’s not forgotten.""</i> <strong>—Chris Spector, <i>Midwest Record</i>, Lake Zurich, IL</strong></p>
<p>Your donation to <i><strong>Bluer Than Velvet</strong></i>  allows us to give this album its full release to the taste makers who point audiences to music worth their time.</p>
<p>Every donation, large or small, that you can afford gets us closer to our goal. Your donation at various levels gains you an early pre-release copy of the <i><strong>Bluer Than Velvet</strong></i>  CD, something from an array of gifts, and your being a part of this effort.</p>
<p><strong>THANK YOU!</strong><br/>And, yes, we have a number of tasty ‘gets’ to interest you at different levels — New York City donors can even choose 'joy for the taste buds' as well as the ears — as our way of saying, “Thank you!”</p>
<p>Even if you’re not in the position to donate today, join us by sharing this campaign with your Facebook and Twitter communities — or passing it on to people you know who love solid and romantic vocal jazz. There are handy IndieGoGo share tools at the upper right of this page, above the perks.</p>
<p>And for each of you who joins this campaign, we will mention, in perpetuity, your part in this effort on the <i><strong>Bluer Than Velvet</strong></i>  page on my website, <a href=""http://www.ejdecker.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>www.ejdecker.com</strong></a> — with your permission, of course — instead of in the usual CD notes, as this CD is now already fully pressed and printed.</p>
<p>Join us in commemorating the amazing voice of Arthur Prysock by pre-ordering this album today and choosing your gift. Let <i><strong>Bluer Than Velvet</strong></i>  be a feast for your ears and your soul.</p>
<p>And enjoy the good karma that lives in that lovely place where, as Arthur said, <i>“tonight is kind of special…”</i></p>

I am out here in this world lending my heart and hands to shaping a world where love is a guiding principle. I have a music project by the name of Timbre Ghost. For those of you familiar, I am humbled by your support. If you are new to the music, I am grateful to have this opportunity to share it with you now.</p><p>A little shy of 2 years ago, I began working on the debut Timbre Ghost EP. It was a culmination of the process of making sense of years of struggle, of finding a voice, and of putting to rest a chapter of trying to escape the world around me. ""The Ledger"" was released in the Fall of 2016. It's been a beautiful process of coming back into the world. The music and band have been a joy to share with each and every person who has spent a moment with Timbre Ghost. The time has come to create and share the next work of heart. It will be a full-length release, and will be released on both vinyl LP and digital format. Your contribution and support will directly help this project see the light of day. Your support will foster this message of empathy, love, and understanding. Also, your support will help bring to life a pretty decent batch of songs and great record, if I may be so bold.</p><p>Let's talk details now. I seek to raise $5,000 funding for this project. Making records can be an expensive venture. Where I'm at now, I simply can't shoulder this cost. As tough as it can be to ask for help, I am here to do so now. Here's a little breakdown of where the money will go.</p><ul>
<li>$2500 for studio time, engineering, and mixing the record</li>
<li>$400 for guest musicians &amp; creative contributions</li>
<li>$500 for mastering the record</li>
<li>$1600 for production of LP's and packaging</li>
</ul><p>Any funds raised above and beyond the campaign goal will be directly applied towards fulfilling orders &amp; perks, and promotion of the record. And, speaking of perks? Yes, there are some delightful perks to be had! Interested in a Timbre Ghost T-shirt? Yeah, I got you. How about getting your hands on an LP, for that superb fidelity? Yeah, it's coming out on vinyl. Looking to finally get a copy of The Ledger on cd? There's a perk just waiting just for you. Am I serious about a lifetime on the guest list at any/all Timbre Ghost shows? Yes, that too is a perk. Lastly, will I really clean your house/apartment/condo/living space as a perk? Yes. This is not a joke. To see these perks, please make your way to the ""Perks"" page. </p><p>In the event the goal is not met, I intend to apply every bit of money raised towards studio time, engineering, and mixing the record. I also intend to see everyone's perks met and fulfilled. This may present with a degree of difficulty, should the goal not be met, but it's a contingency I'm keeping mindful of. I'm in this thing to see it through to the finish, no matter what the outcome of the campaign. That being said, let's do all we can to meet this modest goal. </p><p>As stated in the overview for the campaign, I seek to foster connections, share community, and to offer a lens through which to gain insight into experience. Communicating through art, through music, and through expression are the most direct means for me to get across. The songs written for this full-length record span the continuum of human experience. The content brushes up against the depths of the breathtaking and heartbreaking times we are living in. Dialogue is vital, visibility is crucial. I offer voice through experience. </p><p>I plan to do all that lies within my power to see this project launched, funded, and completed successfully. Asking for help is always a difficult process for me. However, as noted in my video, countless life-altering shared and personal experiences have come into my life through the act of asking for help. I'm inclined to keep some details of the production of this project a mystery, as art doesn't always do well by explanation. However, if you wish to have a discussion, or have any questions on any aspect of this campaign, project, or anything else I urge you to reach out directly to me. I am an open book.</p><p>Any bit of support is going to take this thing far. Each and every contribution is important. If you are able to help by spreading the word on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc... please, you would be doing me worlds of assistance. For this, I am so grateful. Support through pledges, orders, donations... I am deeply grateful for any level you feel you are able to help. Indiegogo has some awfully convenient share tools to help promote this campaign, and so many other meaningful campaigns alike. Please, share and share alike.
