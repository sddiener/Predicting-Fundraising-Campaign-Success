you for your time and consideration in reading this project and watching the

<p><b>Getting
to the Point</b></p>
<p>We
all spend an average of $25 to $50 regularly in many things. Just think about
how much money Uncle Sam takes from your paycheck every month, how many times
you've gotten a parking ticket, paid for an expensive item you didn't need, or
bought non-winning lottery tickets. This is the perfect time to reflect and get
into action: what would I rather be doing with these $25 - $50?  Well, I
can think of only one marvelous thing!  Crowdfunding my project to help
others.  Why not spend a few dollars on something we both want to be part
of…cash for a unique project! …. Yes, cash to continue developing a much
needed drug for patients with pancreatic cancer who are desperately waiting for
a breakthrough. Do not miss this opportunity to be a part of something
significant!</p>
<p>I
will do the hard work and you will get the satisfaction of having contributed
to this project.  We both will be proud to help others by supporting this unique project. Why do I think your contribution will make a difference? Here's
the reason: more than four decades have passed since the war against cancer was
declared by Congress. For pancreatic cancer the net result is ZERO because
scientists keep repeating again and again methods that don't work.  We have
NOT conquered pancreatic cancer!! The death rates continue to increase and
there are no drugs or cures to deal with this lethal malignancy.  But
together, you and I can make the difference. You can help me achieve my goal
of creating something different and you will get the satisfaction of helping me
to do it! But the only way I can advance this project is with your generous
help! <br/></p>

Matters to You please chip in with any amount you can and get a reward for your
contribution! </p>
<p><b>Who
leads this campaign?</b></p>
<p>This
fundraiser is led by Dr. Irene Gonzalez, an entrepreneur,
independent inventor, business executive, and scientist. She holds BA, MS and PhD degrees and has over
15 years of experience in scientific research at Johns Hopkins University, and 20
years of experience in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries developing
commercial therapeutics for several human diseases including cancer, ophthalmology, infectious diseases and neurology. She created the novel technology from which therapeutic
compounds for cancer and other diseases are created. This technology brings a
unique and novel approach to the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Dr. Gonzalez is pursuing something
completely different to the current standards of care that could make a
difference and potentially impact the way pancreatic cancer is
treated and managed. <br/></p>
<p><b>Dr.
Gonzalez’s commitment</b></p>
<p>I
am fully committed to develop this therapeutic. To demonstrate my passion,
commitment, and dedication to this project, I have contributed $200,000 to support all aspects of this project since

Note
to all our contributors: Your
contributions will fund the goals of the project; however, further development
of the therapeutic will depend on our ability to continue raising money from
the public and/or from accredited investors since the costs to bring this
therapeutic from its current stage of development to the FDA for approval, to clinical
trial, and to the hospital bed are staggering. Since funding is the key to
advance development of this therapeutic, we cannot guaranty that its full development
will be fulfilled.

<p>Occles are the brainchild of couple, Hugh Robertson and Lynne McLeod. We first had the idea for Occles three years ago whilst lying on a beach in Greece. Struggling to rest our eyes in the strong sunlight, we looked around and noticed various methods being employed by our fellow holidaymakers to block out the sun’s glare. The most common seemed to be a towel over the head! </p>

<p></p>
<p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'></span></p>
<p>We knew at that moment, there had to be a better way. </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Do you love the sun but not its glare? </li>
<li>Does it cause you to frown, inducing those unwanted wrinkles
     lines? </li>
<li>Does that glare prevent you from achieving that feeling of
     total relaxation, to zone out and re-charge?</li>
</ul>
<p>A recent Mintel report posted  results that shows over 40% of people who spend time at the beach believe they look healthier with an even suntan on their face. Its actually hard work though due to the strength of the sun!!</p>
<p><b><i>The bridge-less design minimizes tan lines making them popular with sunbathers. A major plus is their 21st century unrivaled design and style which you will be happy to be seen wearing.</i></b><br/></p>

Say hello to the most unique eyewear product.........The  Sleep mask reinvented for the 21st century..........
Occles are unique bridgeless eyeshades that wrap around the head and block out all ambient and uv light. The silicone  rubber eye seals ensure a comfortable fit and the design helps prevent panda/raccoon eyes.They have been invented to allow relaxation and sleep  whenever strong light is present-not just for sunbathing.We want to help you upgrade your travel experience.Whether you are in business or economy -block that disruptive light from the passenger next to you with the film playing or reading light on. As an aid to helping with anti-aging of the delicate skin around the eye, Occles can help and when used with a cooling eye gel the cooling, restful experience is quite addictive.Occles have been
developed to protect your eyes completely from disruptive light throughout your journey from flight to beach,  help combat jet-lag on a  flight or block sun glare when you lay at the beach they also  deliver
the added benefit of reduced tan lines.Next time
you’re jetting off think
about your eyes.............
Are you aware of the risk your eyes are exposed to flying at 30,000ft? Dermatologist
Mark Glashofer* has reported that UVA
rays can penetrate the window glass and burn skin and eyes
whilst travelling. It is recommended to wear both a UV certified eye mask and
sunscreen. One solution is British designed Occles Travel Eyewear, a must have
accessory to be included in your hand luggage for flight travel all year
round. The
design is set to revolutionise how we relax and get some shut eye during a
flight and whilst protecting our eyes
from UV damage. Dr Doris Day a New York dermatologist has been
quoted saying that UVA
Rays can pass through aeroplane windows and that UVA rays are stronger at altitude. Day said, “The fact is, flying at 30,000 feet [for 60 minutes] can be as
dangerous as 20 minutes in a tanning bed”.Occles
are a UV certified travel sleep mask providing protection from
UV light at altitude on a plane or to block out the intrusive reading light of
the passenger next to you.  

Say goodbye to
squinting and premature crows feet, this revolutionary eyewear will help  anti-age your eyes ,
keeping skin smooth and eyes protected from harmful UV damage. The 'no pressure' eyecups cover
and protect the peri-orbital
area of the skin around the eyes known to be more sensitive and
where age spots can sometimes appear first.
‘The human cost of eye damage means that new innovative solutions are needed to protect our eyes from the harmful effects of strong light. Occles are leading the way in their design and approach'

Dr. G. Mulholland,  Associate Director Innovation (2014)









Occles are the brainchild of couple, Hugh Robertson and Lynne McLeod. We first had the idea for Occles three years ago whilst lying on a beach in Greece. Struggling to rest our eyes in the strong sunlight, we looked around and noticed various methods being employed by our fellow holidaymakers to block out the sun’s glare. The most common seemed to be a towel over the head! 






We knew at that moment, there had to be a better way. 


Do you love the sun but not its glare? 
Does it cause you to frown, inducing those unwanted wrinkles
     lines? 
Does that glare prevent you from achieving that feeling of
     total relaxation, to zone out and re-charge?

A recent Mintel report posted  results that shows over 40% of people who spend time at the beach believe they look healthier with an even suntan on their face. Its actually hard work though due to the strength of the sun!!
The bridge-less design minimizes tan lines making them popular with sunbathers. A major plus is their 21st century unrivaled design and style which you will be happy to be seen wearing.
What look do you want?
Raccoon eyes?  
      
 



Or all over perfect, safe face tan..............




Keep your sunglasses for looking cool but on the beach wear your Occles for complete protection.






Following on from the Travel Goods Show 2016 in March  Occles are included in CNN Travel's  Hottest Products Guide. 
In May 2016, Occles eye wear received the 2016 Diamond Award  following an independent review as 'safe beauty product of the month' by www.safetyinbeauty.com

others, it’s lightweight running shoes. We <i>all</i> can agree, however, that we need good
 clothing to do our thing. We know that the right clothes can make the 
difference between a brilliant day and a bad one. We aren’t talking 
about the mis-matched old stuff you use for training. We’re talking 
about game day—when it really matters: that’s when you break out your 
Sunday's finest. And yet after months of preparation for an 
event—whether it’s a 3-day fundraiser walk, 10k trail run or 100-mile 
gran fondo—we all reach for the free safety pins and poke holes in the
 expensive clothing we’ve been waiting to wear.  We knew there had to be
 a better way.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/200139/files/20131115121343-2_Title.png?1384546423"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/200157/files/20131115123032-3_PhotoPinRip.jpg?1384547432"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p></p>Our objective was simple: to hold a number plate in place without 
damaging our clothing (and look good doing it). We wanted a design that 
was as simple as a button and as durable as steel. With over 40 years 
combined experience in cycling and running events and motivated by 
countless holes in our favorite jerseys, tank tops and shorts, our team 
began experimenting with alternatives. We tried various snaps,
 micro-velcro, double-sided tape and finally magnets. Once we started 
playing with rare-earth magnets, it was clear they would be at the core 
of our solution. Field testing 
at events began early in 2013, and soon we narrowed down the size and 
strength magnets that would offer the best performance and durability, 
lowest weight and easiest handling by fingers big and 
small.<br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/200163/files/20131115123402-4_CropCircles.jpg?1384547642"" src="""" style=""""/><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Early RaceDot™ designs</i><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p>In an effort to make the magnet on top of the number easier to handle, 
we decided to glue to it a clear acrylic dome. The natural magnifying 
property of the dome enhances any graphic under it. We stressed the 
aerodynamic factor and refused to settle for what was cheapest. We have 
found it pays not to listen when you hear, ""it's not possible."" Finally, we found <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ü</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ber-aero, ultra low-profile domes. </span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/200160/files/20131115123212-5_Domes.jpg?1384547532"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Next came the task of designing a durable, lightweight shell to keep the
 outside magnet, graphic and acrylic dome together, since glue alone 
would never hold up. This design had to allow the two magnets to lock 
together with a race number and fabric in between. After trying 
many different assemblies, the most effective one, as fate would have it, was the simplest one. <p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/200162/files/20131115123240-6_Carrier.jpg?1384547560"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Over the last 8 months, we have been sourcing materials and

Regarding rules by your governing body of cycling: we are currently working with UCI and USAC and hope for approval of RaceDots at the highest level. There is only one mine in the U.S. producing rare-earth magnet 
materials, and they cater exclusively to the military. Almost every 
other rare-earth magnet that enters the U.S. comes from China (bummer, 
we know). Each shipment of magnets into the U.S. must pay a 10% of value customs fee, which helps explain why no one else has pursued this

<p></p></div>","Athletes love gear. For some, it’s carbon bicycle components. For 
others, it’s lightweight running shoes. We all can agree, however, that we need good
 clothing to do our thing. We know that the right clothes can make the 
difference between a brilliant day and a bad one. We aren’t talking 
about the mis-matched old stuff you use for training. We’re talking 
about game day—when it really matters: that’s when you break out your 
Sunday's finest. And yet after months of preparation for an 
event—whether it’s a 3-day fundraiser walk, 10k trail run or 100-mile 
gran fondo—we all reach for the free safety pins and poke holes in the
 expensive clothing we’ve been waiting to wear.  We knew there had to be
 a better way.Our objective was simple: to hold a number plate in place without 
damaging our clothing (and look good doing it). We wanted a design that 
was as simple as a button and as durable as steel. With over 40 years 
combined experience in cycling and running events and motivated by 
countless holes in our favorite jerseys, tank tops and shorts, our team 
began experimenting with alternatives. We tried various snaps,
 micro-velcro, double-sided tape and finally magnets. Once we started 
playing with rare-earth magnets, it was clear they would be at the core 
of our solution. Field testing 
at events began early in 2013, and soon we narrowed down the size and 
strength magnets that would offer the best performance and durability, 
lowest weight and easiest handling by fingers big and 
small.Early RaceDot™ designsIn an effort to make the magnet on top of the number easier to handle, 
we decided to glue to it a clear acrylic dome. The natural magnifying 
property of the dome enhances any graphic under it. We stressed the 
aerodynamic factor and refused to settle for what was cheapest. We have 
found it pays not to listen when you hear, ""it's not possible."" Finally, we found über-aero, ultra low-profile domes. Next came the task of designing a durable, lightweight shell to keep the
 outside magnet, graphic and acrylic dome together, since glue alone 
would never hold up. This design had to allow the two magnets to lock 
together with a race number and fabric in between. After trying 
many different assemblies, the most effective one, as fate would have it, was the simplest one. Over the last 8 months, we have been sourcing materials and 
manufacturing as well as putting the prototypes through rigorous 
testing. RaceDots™ have not affected RFID, RTLS, ANT or any other 
wireless timing device signals. We have been sending prototypes to timing 
companies and have yet to have a single problem. We also tried different size and strength magnets, an array of domes—in 
fact pretty much every aspect you could factor into RaceDots™ has been 
carefully considered and tested. One question we received on a regular 
basis was, ""Why not make it out of plastic?"" At this point in time we 
feel strongly that there is too much plastic in the world as it is,
 and you simply would not get the quality, durability and attractive 
look of polished, nickel-plated copper (which is higher quality metal 
than a lot of jewelry being sold these days).RaceDots™ Patent Pending Design locks the two magnets togetherHaving options is an important part of bringing any product to market. 
We know that matching gear makes you faster, so we researched colors on 
new running shoes, watches, bike frames, clothing, iPods and eye wear. 
Chances are we have something to match anything you have purchased this year or might purchase next year.  Like most athletes, we find the lack of daylight not only depressing 
but a safety hazard as well. It doesn't have to be race day to snap on a reflective RaceDot™ for a 
some added visibility before the sun comes up. We've been snapping them 
on to our jackets, shorts, even beanies!If you are part of an organized club or corporate team and you see value in branding healthy employees while they run, walk or 
ride, the Custom RaceDot™ is a perfect choice. Have a cycling team that wants matching RaceDots™? Perfect! Band everyone on your team together and support the CustomDots perk to the right. The minimum for custom dots is 200 dots - once we go full retail this is likely to go up (and there won't be a BluRay of that awesome cycling movie, Chasing Legends included). To prove how strong RaceDots™ are, we couldn't afford a wind tunnel so we did the next best thingWhen you support this campaign, shipping charges will be billed once the campaign is completed. We can ship anywhere FedEx goes. Below is the nuts and bolts behind RaceDots™ and our plan to rid the world of evil safety pins.Risks and Challenges We have reduced the variables to only a few. 
Regarding rules by your governing body of cycling: we are currently working with UCI and USAC and hope for approval of RaceDots at the highest level. There is only one mine in the U.S. producing rare-earth magnet 
materials, and they cater exclusively to the military. Almost every 
other rare-earth magnet that enters the U.S. comes from China (bummer, 
we know). Each shipment of magnets into the U.S. must pay a 10% of value customs fee, which helps explain why no one else has pursued this 
concept. Add to that tooling and material charges, and you start to see 
why we need Indiegogo! We will use the money raised on Indiegogo to submit our first order for a minimum of 20,000 RaceDots™. Any lower quantity, and there simply will be no profit.

<h3>Hello, my name is Thomas Fairman, and welcome to <i>T-Water</i>
</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/250049/files/20131208201741-1016068_10151412267625997_1196826303_n.jpg?1386562661"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;"">What is it?</span></p>
<p>This project is an attempt to bring human beings the best drinking water possible.</p>
<h4>What are you going to do?</h4>
<p>My plan is to take tap water, purify it through distillation and activated carbon filtration, and then refortify it with rock salts, electrolytes, and Vitamin-C. This will be called T-Water Blue; it will be the standard form of T-Water, and it'll have the benefits of a sports drink and an immune booster in one, without any artificial colors or flavors.</p>
<p>In addition to T-Water Blue I will be creating two other types of T-Water</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">T-Water Red: designed to increase mental and physical acuity through vitamins B1, B2, and caffeine.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">T-Water Green: designed to boost immune system </span>function<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> and physical recovery through vitamins B6, B12, and extra vitamin-C.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4>Why are you doing this?</h4>
<p>1.<b> I want to give people high quality water.</b> Water is the most important compound in the human body, attributing to over half of human body weight. The water we drink has an even greater impact on us than food does, so it only makes sense that we should provide ourselves with the highest quality of drinking water possible. </p>
<p>2.<b> Bottled water sucks</b><b>!</b> Bottled water accounts for 1.5 million tons of plastic waste every year...that's enough plastic to rebuild the Eiffel Tower out of plastic every 3 days. (5,6) As if that wasn't enough, <b>Aquafina, Dasani, and Arrowhead cost more per gallon than gasoline. </b>On Arrowhead's website, it costs <b>$49 a gallon</b> to order bottled water on a monthly plan. (7) That is utterly absurd.<br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">3. <b>Tap water sucks! </b>Contrary to popular belief, the tap is NOT a safe source of drinking water. There are chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and even tiny organisms in the stuff that comes out of the tap. Check it out: </span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Sodium fluoride, used in tap water to prevent cavities, is lethal in 5-10g doses (that's about two teaspoons)...look at it this way: if you were to drink only from the tap your whole life, you would consume enough fluoride to kill 10 people. (1,2)</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">According to the Associated Press via the USA Today, pharmaceuticals ""including antibiotics, anti-convulsants, mood stabilizers and sex hormones"" have been detected in the tap water of at LEAST 41 MILLION AMERICANS. (3)</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A New York resident H&amp;E stained a sample of his tap water and found these: <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/169634/files/20131101152132-invisible-shrimp.jpg?1383344492"" src="""" style=""""/></p>mosquito larvae eating copepods. Yum. (4)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I think you get the idea...<b><i>we need higher quality sources of water.</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Here's what I need to make this happen:</h3>
<p>1. <b>A distiller</b> - After doing some research, I think the MH943SBS Glass Distiller from Megahome is the best fit for the beginning of this company. It pumps out 4 gallons a day, which isn't an enormous amount, but it's relatively inexpensive, lower in power consumption than most other models on the market, and quiet, so I won't wake up my roommates when I need to make some water. If I do need to increase my capacity for making water, I can purchase a second one or upgrade to something bigger later on. ($219)</p>
<p>2. <b>Activated Carbon Filters</b> - The Megahome distiller comes with activated carbon filters, so this won't be a cost factor until I need to buy replacements in about 6 months.</p>
<p>3. <b>Stainless steel and Glass bottles</b> - </p>
<p>I will be selling T-Water in several different types of containers. </p>

What is it?
This project is an attempt to bring human beings the best drinking water possible.
What are you going to do?
My plan is to take tap water, purify it through distillation and activated carbon filtration, and then refortify it with rock salts, electrolytes, and Vitamin-C. This will be called T-Water Blue; it will be the standard form of T-Water, and it'll have the benefits of a sports drink and an immune booster in one, without any artificial colors or flavors.
In addition to T-Water Blue I will be creating two other types of T-Water



T-Water Red: designed to increase mental and physical acuity through vitamins B1, B2, and caffeine.


T-Water Green: designed to boost immune system function and physical recovery through vitamins B6, B12, and extra vitamin-C.



Why are you doing this?
1. I want to give people high quality water. Water is the most important compound in the human body, attributing to over half of human body weight. The water we drink has an even greater impact on us than food does, so it only makes sense that we should provide ourselves with the highest quality of drinking water possible. 
2. Bottled water sucks! Bottled water accounts for 1.5 million tons of plastic waste every year...that's enough plastic to rebuild the Eiffel Tower out of plastic every 3 days. (5,6) As if that wasn't enough, Aquafina, Dasani, and Arrowhead cost more per gallon than gasoline. On Arrowhead's website, it costs $49 a gallon to order bottled water on a monthly plan. (7) That is utterly absurd.
3. Tap water sucks! Contrary to popular belief, the tap is NOT a safe source of drinking water. There are chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and even tiny organisms in the stuff that comes out of the tap. Check it out: 



Sodium fluoride, used in tap water to prevent cavities, is lethal in 5-10g doses (that's about two teaspoons)...look at it this way: if you were to drink only from the tap your whole life, you would consume enough fluoride to kill 10 people. (1,2)

According to the Associated Press via the USA Today, pharmaceuticals ""including antibiotics, anti-convulsants, mood stabilizers and sex hormones"" have been detected in the tap water of at LEAST 41 MILLION AMERICANS. (3)
A New York resident H&E stained a sample of his tap water and found these: mosquito larvae eating copepods. Yum. (4)

I think you get the idea...we need higher quality sources of water.




Here's what I need to make this happen:
1. A distiller - After doing some research, I think the MH943SBS Glass Distiller from Megahome is the best fit for the beginning of this company. It pumps out 4 gallons a day, which isn't an enormous amount, but it's relatively inexpensive, lower in power consumption than most other models on the market, and quiet, so I won't wake up my roommates when I need to make some water. If I do need to increase my capacity for making water, I can purchase a second one or upgrade to something bigger later on. ($219)
2. Activated Carbon Filters - The Megahome distiller comes with activated carbon filters, so this won't be a cost factor until I need to buy replacements in about 6 months.
3. Stainless steel and Glass bottles - 
I will be selling T-Water in several different types of containers. 



25 oz glass bottles - $1.35 apiece 


Customized stainless steel bottles -$3.60 apiece (for 50 bottles). T-Water logo laser-engraved on the side!


1 gallon glass bottles - $2.33 apiece




4. Ingredients: 



Caffeine - one of these and one of these to test each out. The advanced caffeine supplement might not dissolve as well in water, but it has some extra compounds that will make T-Water Red even more potent. (~$18 with shipping)


Electrolyte packs - $17.39 each on Amazon, I'll purchase two of these to start off with. ($34.78 total)


Rock Salts - 2 pounds Hawaiian ($7.99/lb) and 1 pound Himalayan ($9.41/kg). Plus shipping will cost about $35.


Vitamin-C - I'll get two of these, for a total of $20.13 plus shipping


Vitamin B1 - $6.49


Vitamin B2 - $9.49


Vitamin B6 - $10.78


Vitamin B12 - $7.52






5. Mortar and Pestle - to grind up my ingredients for dissolution into the water. 13.95 + ~$6 shipping.
6. Labels - to print my nutrition facts, data, and logo on. 100 sheets of labels (I'll put two on each bottle) cost $18.95 plus $4.95 shipping ($23.90 total). Printing won't be an issue because I live on a college campus with printers galore.
That's as transparent as I can be with this funding for this project. Assuming that I start with 50 stainless steel bottles, 50 twenty-five oz glass bottles, and 10 one gallon bottles, my primary costs will come out to about $750 + tax + shipping perks + Indiegogo fees for a total of around $1000-1250. I'll want to crank out more than that though, so the more funding I receive, the more I can give!



Spread the word!
Thanks for supporting and learning about T-Water, it really means a lot to me. Even if you can't support this project with funding, spread the word and tell people the truth about the water they consume!
Use the Indiegogo share tools! 
Talk about what you've heard about water on Facebook! 
This isn't just about T-Water, it's important that people know what they are putting in their bodies.

One week into my diagnosis, someone introduced me to another woman who had lived with MS for thirty years.  I thought talking to her would help, but it didn't. She was bitter and I wanted to be hopeful.</p>
<p>I made a documentary about my first year with MS called katescounterpane.com; I made a choice to be emotionally honest through video, photos and text.  Kate's Counterpane launched in 2009 and I continue to get 2-3 phone calls a week from people newly diagnosed who are deeply grateful for its presence.  This has made me realize that people need a way to connect each other not only via sharing the daily experience of illness (the clinical) but by sharing the emotions behind the illness (the psychological).  This is how the Moodifier™ was born.</p>
<p>The Moodifier can be accessed on a desktop or smartphone and is designed for patients, caregivers and supporters.  It offers a way to tell your story via text, photos and videos and to categorize the emotional highs and lows.  By using it, other users can view someone's entire emotional journey in one look, making it easier to find someone who might be a positive connection.  </p>

<p>This site will be a place where a newly diagnosed individual can find someone who offers context to all the scary ""what ifs."" It is a place where the longest sufferers of chronic illness may be given a renewed sense of purpose. It is a place where caregivers, whose lives have been forever changed by the illness of someone they love, have a platform to seek practical advice and share their own feelings.  It is a place is where patients and caregivers undergoing treatment can update friends and family on their progress. </p>
<p>A counterpane is a patchwork quilt created from a variety of fabrics which, when sewn together, creates warmth and beauty as a whole.  My Counterpane is the experiential version of this quilt: A community that celebrates the virtual, remembers the real, and ultimately, <em>counters pain</em> with the knowledge of who we are, what we know, and how we feel.</p>
<p>The first counterpane at mycounterpane.com will be focused around MS.  As the site gains traction, other diseases will follow, broadening our focus and expanding our user base.  Your contribution is critically appreciated, as is the simple but tremendously helpful act of passing this link along to anyone you know who may be interested in what we're doing.  Also, if you'd like to receive the initial version of this site once built, please sign up for a notifcation at signup.mycounterpane.com- no spam, just an email introducing you to the tangible result of many generous people who have decided to help me launch my dream.</p>

<h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
Currently, digitalrunning.com is a free service. It is free to register an account, log your races and have them verified. Our bulk race discounts are available to all registered members. Our generic training plans are available to all readers. There is a fee to register for challenges and join our overnight relay teams.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the same way, the next phase of digitalrunning.com will also be free to use. Any user can browse races, see race ratings, get race recommendations, join groups and interact with other participants online.</div>

<div>After successfully completing the Walt Disney World marathon in January and logging her result on digitalrunning.com, Mary realizes that she can earn additional medals for her efforts. She pays $15 to sign up for the digitalrunning.com Interstate Challenge. Over the summer, Mary runs the Grandma's half-marathon near her home in Duluth. She logs her result on digitalrunning.com, where it is verified against the official race results. A week later, a shiny new Interstate Challenge medal arrives in the mail and Mary proudly hangs it on her medal rack.""</div>

She logs her result on digitalrunning.com, where it is verified against the official race results. A week later, a shiny new Interstate Challenge medal arrives in the mail and Mary proudly hangs it on her medal rack.""
 
We hope our challenges will continue to help people step out of their comfort zones to try new races. We hope the online communities that develop around those races will foster a lifetime love of running.

<p class=""p1"">Samuella turned 9 years old this April and time is running out for her to have an operation that will greatly improve the quality of her life. Samuella has Spina Bifida and must have an operation before the age of 10.  At three days old, Samuella underwent surgery but the operation was not entirely successful. She suffers from a lack of any control over urination and bowel movements. She must wear diapers. She has difficulty walking. Samuella is bright and a good student. She has a fighting spirit and wants to believe that she can have the same dreams as every young girl: that she will grow up to be strong and healthy and find love and have her own family. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Samuella lives in Burundi with her family - her mom, Chantal and her dad, Clement, her grandmother, Josephine, and her brothers. There are no surgeons skilled to perform this operation in Burundi. Burundi is a poor country and there is no healthcare. Samuella and her mom must travel from Burundi to the Artemis Hospital in Delhi, India. The cost to travel, the hospital fees, the medication, the cost of the consultations and the surgeon's fees will come to $15,000 USD. </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>WHO are We?</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">We are her family and friends. Some of us are in Burundi and some of us are in Canada. We are doing our best to raise the money for Samuella's treatment. But we need your help.</p>

<p class=""p1"">You can help us reach our goal of $15,000. A gift of $5, $10 or $25 would make a tremendous difference. ALL of the money raised will go towards Samuella's treatment.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>The Center 4 Nutrition in Cap-Haition</strong></p>
<p>Cap Haitien is a city of approximately 1 million people on the north coast of the island- nation of Haiti. This is the second largest city in the country. One of the biggest issues that most families face in this city is malnourished kids growing up without food to eat. The main cause of this problem is due to the high unemployment rate, as well as single parented homes, mostly women. The Center 4 Nutrition is helping families cope with these problems, with a children center in downtown Cap-Haitian that receives kids Monday through Friday where we give them two meals a day. Their parents drop them off at the center at 8 am and pick them up at 2 pm, giving them a chance at going to school or in search of employment. We are not an orphanage because we believe strongly in the building up of families. We have been working with these types of issues in Cap-Haitian for over 15 years.</p>
<p><strong>With malnutrition being such a big issue in Cap-Haitian</strong>, we feel very proud of the work we have done in the past 15 years. Many of the young people in Cap-Haitian who are now in High School and under were kids who have pass through our program and now are at normal body weight and have been successful in life.</p>
<p><strong>It is known</strong> that the kids in our program would not have received the care that they received from us if it were not for our program. We are the only Nutrition program in Cap geared to poor people to receive food and care free of charge.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s where we need your help</strong>: we currently are having some problems with the area in which we care for these kids. So we have three spot projects that we need your help in improving the conditions in which we serve these kids. (1) We have a leaky roof in the area where our kids play and have lunch that we would like to recover. This is going to cost us $2,500.00 USD. (2) We would like to fix the toilets and bathrooms for the kids, this is the area that the kids take baths and have their diapers changed from time to time. This area is going to cost us $2,500.00 USD to fix. (3) We need a new gas stove to cook the daily meals. In Haiti, electricity is not something that most of the country has often, it is very sporadic. Therefore most people use burning charcoal for cooking (this is historically the most preferred by the Haitians). But we are a program that believes in saving the environment, which is why we rather use gas stoves, but currently our gas stove is in need of changing, and this will cost us $3,000.00 USD. We need your help to better help these underprivileged kids.</p>
<p><strong>Our goa</strong>l is to fix the leaky roof, bathrooms of these kids, and purchasing a new gas stove by August of 2013 with your help to better serve the malnourished kids of Cap-Haitian.</p>
<p><strong>Your support:</strong> funding our program will help us a great deal, but if you are not able to financially support please spread the word to others and share this link to everyone you know, we also appreciate your prayers and concerns. Thank you.</p>

This is something I have been waiting for for a very long time... Binding has caused me a lot of health problems (staph on my chest, pneumonia, and a couple of broken ribs) as well as making already existing health conditions more painful. I would love very much to to be able to breathe at night next to my partner, and to not feel it necessary to sleep in a compression shirt.</span></p>
<p>I am Sage, and currently I am attempting to raise funds to have a chest recontouring. This is an incredibly gender affirming surgery that also is a little out of most peoples budget. Basically this entails the removal of my breasts tissue and shaping of the chest to look more masculine. </p>
<p>I have been on testosterone for six months, and have been researching surgeons and their prices since I was 15. I am now 24. Unfortunately I have been unable to find surgeons that have payment options, especially ones that have realistic payment plans. There are also foundations that occasionally help low income trans* kids with their surgery costs, but unfortunately have a tendency to pit people with the same problems against eachother, requiring answers to essay questions, in hopes of coming out the victor, and claiming their prize as a new man. </p>
<p>Below is what I had written for one said foundation:</p>
<p><em>I am Sage. I have not gone by my birth name in literally a decade, and it still makes me uncomfortable to hear, even when it is being used to address someone else. I grew up with a pretty progressive mother who was excited when I came out as queer at thirteen, but is a lot less enthusiastic about my recent transition. I have been on Testosterone for six months, using a vial provided by my neighbor who could no longer be on his because of his health insurance. I eventually heard about NCNM in Portland (just in the knick of time) and got my own vial after borrowing money. </em><br/><em>My family has never really had money, and I believe this may be part of the reason my mother is less excited for me to be happy about my transition than I am. She knows surgery is not inexpensive, and knows some things can go seriously wrong. </em><br/><em>My entire life I have suffered terrible dysphoria because of my chest. I was cursed with a 32"" DDD chest that I had to hear called a ""blessing"" my entire life. I have bound with multiple bras, duct tape, ace bandages, and finally real binders, though nothing seems to be able to compress my chest enough to pass. As I grow facial hair I pass more and more. My voice has dropped considerably, and I am so grateful, though I feel these things only make the dysphoria worse. As I watch the rest of my body become my true self, I am still bound to a visibly female body. </em><br/><em>I would love more than anything to be able to feel my bare chest pressed against one of my lovers.</em></p>
<p>This is something most people have never really had to think about unless they have a trans* loved one, but that is very much a real problem. Something as simple as one surgery has the potential to rid a person of dysphoria entirely, eliminating the need for things like anti-depressants. Unfortunately, having top surgery costs about three times what it would cost someone to get breast implants.</p>
<p>I am here today to ask for help paying for this surgery, as working a minimum wage job and living in Seattle does not allow me to save at all. </p>
<p>Your donations would be going towards:</p>
<p>Consultation.</p>
<p>An experienced surgeon.</p>
<p>Operating room fees.</p>
<p>Travel.</p>
<p>Aftercare and follow up.</p>
<p>Medication. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any extra funds would be donated to another trans* kid in need of surgery, or hormone replacement therapy. I believe it is incredibly important ""Pay it forward"" when it comes to Trans* issues. Recently there has been a lot of media coverage sorrounding the LGBTQ community, but rarely is the ""T"" addressed. Maybe lack of knowledge, or lack of visability are the reasons things such as Hormone Replacement Therapy, or top surgery arent covered by insurance. My sincerest hope is to feel like the human I know I am. To finally feel like a whole human, and to not feel totally out of place in my own body. </p>

<h1>Sivananda Prison Outreach Program</h1>
<h3>The Project is comprised of the following aspects:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Sending Yoga books to prisoners</li>
<li>Letter correspondence with prisoners</li>
<li>Teaching Yoga in prisons – Hatha Yoga, Yoga philosophy, meditation</li>
<li>Organizing day-long programs in prisons</li>
<li>Making personal visits to prisoners</li>
<li>Raising funds, mainly for book distribution, $5,000-$10,000 per year (please see box below for donation information.)</li>
</ol>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>In 1996, Prison Life magazine published an article written by an inmate describing the inspiration and joy the ""Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga"" (CIBY) by Swami Vishnudevananda brought him.  A book review mentioned that the book was available to all prisoners at no cost.  Within weeks a deluge of letters from inmates arrived at the Sivananda AshramYoga Ranch, upstate New York, requesting copies of the book. </p>
<p>Letter correspondence with the prisoners began immediately, as did a fundraising program to meet the growing requests for books. Heartfelt letters of gratitude from prisoners proved the initial success of the Project, gave them a sense of “belonging”, enabling them to express their feelings and aspirations, and gave them a safe place to ask questions and have their doubts cleared.</p>
<p>Yoga classes began in 1998 at two local New York prisons. The program succeeded immediately, uplifting and inspiring inmates.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Book Distribution</h3>
<p>Our biggest activity continues to be distribution of the CIBY and other publications by Swami Vishnu and Swami Sivananda.  To date the Prison Project has mailed well over 4500 books. </p>
<p class=""style1"">Fundraising</p>
<p>The genuine sympathy of well-wishers has kept the program alive. Even $14 can buy one book.</p>
<h3>Inspiring Correspondence</h3>
<p>Although most prisoner correspondence relates to book requests, many letters come from inmates who are serious spiritual practitioners, who receive advice and guidance.</p>
<h3>Insights</h3>
<p>During the past 14 years, we have gained valuable insight into the prison system, which unfortunately does not live up to the true meaning of “correctional facility.” We believe in teaching prisoners a new way of thinking that empowers them to lead cleaner, more peaceful lives through Yoga in its many forms.</p>
<p>Although USA prison libraries contain many religious books, there are very few on Yoga and Eastern philosophy.</p>
<h3>Donations</h3>
<p>100% of all donations go to Prison Project activities such as purchasing books and other Yoga items, correspondence expenses, occasional visits to prisoners, and costs involved in teaching in prisons. There are no salaries to be paid or any administration costs, and all donations are tax-deductible. Your generous donations are much appreciated, and can make a great difference to an inmate locked up for years on end.</p>

<h3>The USA prison system - statistics</h3>
<p>The United States has the highest prison population rate in the world, 756 per 100,000 of the national population (2008). At yearend 2008, the total incarcerated population equaled 2,424,279 inmates. <br/>(Ref: <a href=""http://drugwarfacts.org/cms/?q=node/62"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://drugwarfacts.org/cms/?q=node/62</a>). The average cost to house a prisoner is approx. $55/day, which amounts to about $20,000/year. Inmates in solitary confinement can cost $60,000/year. <br/><br/>States are spending more money on prisons than education. Over the course of the last 20 years, the amount of money spent on prisons was increased by 570% while that spent on elementary and secondary education was increased by only 33%. (Ref: <a href=""http://www.heartsandminds.org/prisons/facts.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.heartsandminds.org/prisons/facts.htm</a>).</p>

During the past 14 years, we have gained valuable insight into the prison system, which unfortunately does not live up to the true meaning of “correctional facility.” We believe in teaching prisoners a new way of thinking that empowers them to lead cleaner, more peaceful lives through Yoga in its many forms.
Although USA prison libraries contain many religious books, there are very few on Yoga and Eastern philosophy.
Donations
100% of all donations go to Prison Project activities such as purchasing books and other Yoga items, correspondence expenses, occasional visits to prisoners, and costs involved in teaching in prisons. There are no salaries to be paid or any administration costs, and all donations are tax-deductible. Your generous donations are much appreciated, and can make a great difference to an inmate locked up for years on end.

The USA prison system - statistics
The United States has the highest prison population rate in the world, 756 per 100,000 of the national population (2008). At yearend 2008, the total incarcerated population equaled 2,424,279 inmates. (Ref: http://drugwarfacts.org/cms/?q=node/62). The average cost to house a prisoner is approx. $55/day, which amounts to about $20,000/year. Inmates in solitary confinement can cost $60,000/year. States are spending more money on prisons than education. Over the course of the last 20 years, the amount of money spent on prisons was increased by 570% while that spent on elementary and secondary education was increased by only 33%.

<p>In a healthcare system where countless people go without coverage, the philosophies of self-care or preventative care are foreign to many. I want to bridge the gap to health and healing by making massage not only affordable and accessible, but through actively promoting self-care practices.</p>
<p><strong>The Experiment in Giving</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>My mission is to give 10 distinctly different people free bi-weekly massage therapy sessions for 6 months. These people are teachers, community leaders, single parents, homeless folks and local business owners. They have health issues ranging from seizure disorders to scoliosis. Together, we will document our experiences and testify of the transformative power of massage. Throughout this “Experiment in Giving” I plan to share our stories by way of an online blog, which at the end of the experiment, will be published and distributed as a zine.</p>
<p>My hope is to not only provide free massage and radically impact the health of 10 awesome people but also to inspire more social dialogue around the importance of self-care.</p>
<p>By funding this campaign or simply passing the word along, you can help bring healing to people who normally wouldn’t have access to massage and help me carry out my dream.</p>
<p>To make this mission a reality, I need support; be it moral or financial. Hey, I like online or real-life cheerleaders and I’ll definitely need financial backing in order to do this.</p>
<p>Whether you’re an expectant mother…a hard working bartender…a coach….a boss who wants to give back to your hard working employees….another massage therapist…or anyone willing to purchase and receive a session from me….or give one away…its all here.</p>
<p>I am asking for $10,000 because I did some math. Yep, 25 massage sessions a week (which is the ideal amount of sessions I can and am willing to do per week) at $30 a session (that’s half the price of what a ‘normal’ session costs) multiplied by 6 months equals...well, $18,000! Hence, I am asking for less than the total amount that I would earn if I went the classical route working for myself alone. I am outsourcing to you all here and now because I believe $10,000 for 6 months of dynamic bodywork is a win/win situation for us all! This campaign is my way of putting myself, and my work, out there for the folks in Gainesville and around the globe that want to have affordable dynamic intuitive bodywork in their lives or simply want to help make it possible for others.</p>
<p>The funds raised through this campaign will not only directly impact my ability to serve my community through providing free massages to folks without healthcare, but will also empower me to build my own practice that’s centered on giving and ultimately fulfill my dream of bringing massage to the working-class.</p>
<p>In detail, the money raised through this campaign will help cover rent for my office space, the many bottles of massage lotion produced by local vendors, the excessive amounts of laundry, the gas in my tank for trips to different charity events or peoples homes that can not make the trip to an office space, and most likely a farmers market or 20. I do want to purchase a massage chair. As of now, I am borrowing one so that I can use it at events. And of course, the funds will also be used to feed and house myself because I need the basics in life too. Basically, these contributions will fund my existence and allow me to give and give and give and do what I love.</p>
<p><strong>I see this as a win/win situation. You sign up for a massage and you get a massage….this is not a charity situation. This is an experiment in giving.</strong></p>
<p>So again, the perks are simple and ranging and vast. If you live in town and want to purchase a massage…sign up and let the bodywork begin. If you live in or out of town, purchase a session for a friend…a club…a nonprofit…an office party…a random stranger…you get the idea. Massages will be had. This all being said, I am one person and I can reasonably do 20 massages a week (plus the free sessions for the group of 10) so it’s first come first serve…The campaign is 30 days long but I will begin the massage list as soon as people start signing up. THe 10 person group will officially begin the 3rd week of May. My vision is that, if my goal is met…hint hint…it will take me the next 3-6 months to accomplish all this awesomeness. Of course, I am here and committed and the massages will not stop at 6 months but I want to put that time frame out there so everyone is aware.</p>
<p>This is a deal….the going rate for an hour massage typically starts at $60. I am offering $30 sessions not only to get the ball rolling but also because I have ALWAYS offered sliding scale pricing and want to continue this throughout my practice. From day one and forever onward I want people to have access to the bodywork they need AND can afford. I walk the walk…..This is MY mission and I can truly only speak for myself….but if I believe the present healthcare system is failing--and oh, I do--and I strongly believe in preventive healthcare--and oh, I really do--then how can I justify charging everyone the same? I cannot and I will not. Period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A little bit about me, how I got here, and why I believe in massage.</strong></p>
<p>I endlessly thank my hard working parents for raising me under the rule of thumb: Be giving. Always. Whether it was the homeless shelter my parents helped run against much opposition in downtown Richmond VA or bringing an entire Cambodian family into our home until they could successful be on their own, all of it guided me to find my true self and my inner strength in order to survive a very traumatic childhood illness and emergency surgery. The details are not as important as the outcome: ME. My experience facing a life-threatening situation has instilled in me a great awareness around pain and suffering and has inspired me to find ways in which I can bring healing into the present.</p>
<p>In my experience as a LMT, I have noticed that there seems to be this crazy stigma that massage therapy is a luxury reserved for the rich or those who can selfishly pamper themselves. I could rant about that all day, believe me….but the truth is that massage therapy has been used in healing since, well, forever. Part of this campaign is to encourage a shift in the cultural perceptions around massage and promote the idea that therapeutic touch is vital to the health of the human body, spirit and mind.</p>
<p>The practice of being present in one’s body helps us gradually begin to understand what we need and want. How do you want to bring healing into the present? What assistance do you need from others? This kind of self-awareness has no price tag and the dialogue around self-care it is an integral part of what I am all about.</p>
<p>I am committed to this town and the people in it. I have traveled across the country and back playing music and giving massages along the way. What I’ve learned is that there are so many people ready and willing to be giving in so many ways…you just need to ask. People gave and gave and I not only survived life on the road, but I also thrived in creating a life worth living.</p>
<p>I truly believe in the healing potential of massage therapy.  I want to continue to build my massage therapy practice and reach out to more people who want to bring health and healing into the present….Any and all contributions will be accepted and shared through my work and I am grateful for any and all cheerleaders who want to get on the horn, or the twitter…or the facebook…or this or that to help me launch this experiment. Feel free to send me a message, encouragements, criticisms, questions and I will respond.</p>
<p>Thanks IndieGoGo for existing and for anyone and everyone who has read this entire proclamation. Be well…..and get a massage already!    </p>

<h3><strong>UPDATE!!</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1st round of chemo finished yesterday. No unexpected complications. Doctors are possibly going to push up round 2 by a week. Now, to keep him healthy until round 2.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Yesterday chest port was installed. Today cycle one of chemo begins for him. 6 days inpatient...</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>No evidence of disease in lungs. 3 rounds of chemo, 6 weeks of radiation, then 3 more rounds of chemo. Starting within 2 weeks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Thursday Terry was able to have his full body PET/CT Scan. These results will be used to see if the disease has spread anywhere, and to decide to absolute best and most appropriate treatment for him. We should know the results and treatment plan on Wednesday, the 8th. Please hope and pray for the best possible results...Thank you.</strong></p>

<h3>Please Help Terry Through His Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
<p>My son Terry was recently diagnosed with a synovial sarcoma. Synovial sarcoma is an extremely rare and  highly aggressive soft tissue cancer, that has a tendency to spread to the patients lungs.</p>
<p>Terry had the symptoms of this tumor since the age of 14. We went to the doctors on numerous occasions, just to be ignored and told it was pain due to his being thin. Early this year, Terry went to an outside doctor who immediately noticed it was a tumor, and sent him for approriate tests. He had surgery last Wednesday, in which the primary tumor was removed. He just received the catastrophic diagnosis a few days ago, and are working to accept it. At the same time we were told thatsome of the treatment he will need, will not be covered. Including some of the important scans needed in order to properly stage and treat this disease.</p>
<p>Terry has always been a great kid. He did great in school, and he has worked since he was 15. He is an Electrical Engineering student and was hoping to transfer to UOP next Fall. He is engaged and has a 2 year old son, Joshua, who adores him. He has worked really hard to get where he is. Terry and his son live in a house they rent. Terry works fulltime while also going to school fulltime. He is a great father, son, brother and god willing, a husband someday. We have found him great doctors at UCSF. He just cannot afford all of the tests and treatments needed.</p>
<p>Terry has never liked asking anyone for help. He has always been a prideful person, and a hard worker. He has never expected something for nothing.</p>
<p>the doctor informed us that he will not be able to work through his treatment. Even if he is granted disability, he will not be able to afford the basic necessities of life, let alone cancer treatment. He will be having impatient chemotherapy and radiation treatment, once we are able to get all of the body scans needed, in order to see if it has spread. His best case scenario is missing months of work. We live 40 miles from the treatment center, where even parking is $28 a day.</p>
<p>We also want to do everything we can to make sure Terry does not have to drop out of school, as he has worked so hard to get to this point.</p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Hope You Can Help With</h3>
<p>Anticipated needs to get him and his family thru treatment:</p>
<ul>
<li>He needs to start with a PET scan which runs around $8000, prior to beginning treatment</li>
<li>He will need follow up CT scans every 3-6 months</li>
<li>We are hoping to raise enough to help with their rent, utilities and groceries while he is off of work, as well as transportation costs to and from the hospital.</li>
<li>Other medical expenses and medications that are not or will not be covered</li>
</ul><h3>The Impact This Has Had</h3>
<p>This diagnosis has been a huge blow to our entire family. Though no one deserves a cancer diagnosis, we cannot wrap our heads around this happening to Terry. He is a great young man loved by anyone who knows him. He is a terriffic father who has been hands on since his son Joshua's birth. He helps anyone who is in need, any chance he gets. I just want Terry to be able to get the cancer treatment he needs and deserves, in order to give him the best possible chance at a long life!</p>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I wanted to clear up some confusion. <strong>There is no minimun donation.</strong> Every cent counts and helps..</p>
<p>It was suggested to me that I put an alternative way to donate other then through this sight. Especially for larger donations, as they take a portion, as does paypal.</p>
<p>You can contact me via email at <a href=""mailto:aprilephillip@comcast.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">aprilephillips@comcast.net</a> . Please be sure to include a return address so that we can thank you appropriately. Checks can simply be made out to Terry Richards.</p>
<p>Others have enquired about transportation needs. He would greatly appreciate gas cards, as the frequent trips to San Francisco are draining him. He has access to Shell, Chevron, and Safeway. Safeway gas is the cheapest in our area.</p>
<p>Please, get the word out. Share this with your co-workers, church, family, friends and social networks.</p>

<p>My name is Kirsten, I work full-time and have a 3 year old little girl named Brooklyn who will be 4 in August. I raise my daughter by myself with no support from her father. I was diagnosed with HPV right after finding out I was pregnant with my daughter back in 2007, I keep up with my check-ups every year and this one wasn’t normal, they told me I was high-risk for cervical cancer and I would need a colposcopy to examine the abnormal cells and to get a biopsy. When I got my biopsy results it came back with moderate dysplasia which is pre-cancerous cells on the cervix. I have to have what is called a LEEP procedure to remove the abnormal cells before they turn into cancer. Unfortunately the company that I work for does not offer any kind of health insurance as they are a small business, so I contacted my local government aid office to see if I would qualify for Medicaid and I don’t. Unless I make less than $200 a month or have been diagnosed with CANCER they will not help me. I also reached out to the American Cancer Society and there is nothing they can do to help me either. So do I sit back and wait until this turns into cancer before I can get the medical help that I need? I am all that my baby girl has, and I don’t want her to watch her mother die from cancer or go through the things that someone with cancer goes through.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This campaign is to help raise funds for surgery to remove the abnormal pre-cancerous cells from the cervix before they turn into cancer. This is very important to me because I want to take care of the problem before it gets any worse when it could have been prevented.  I have a little girl to raise and I would hate to have to quit my job so that the state will help me with my surgery or wait until I get cancer to get the help that I need which is going to in turn cost the taxpayers more money on something that could have been prevented. Please help so that I can watch my daughter grow up and enjoy all the things that a parent enjoys with their children.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I can raise enough money for this surgery I can get this problem taken care of and not have to worry about things getting any worse than they already are. I will be able to watch my daughter grow and enjoy parenthood. I will be able to continue to work and provide for my daughter the best that I possibly can.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The surgery is going to be around $2,500 and this solely goes to the doctor and surgery center for the procedure. Dr. Evan Wood of West Plains Missouri.</p>
<p>The company that I work for Countryside Pet Supply is going to give a $10 gift certificate for every $100 donation.  This gift certificate will be good for <a href=""http://www.countrysidepet.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.countrysidepet.com</a>.</p>

This is very important to me because I want to take care of the problem before it gets any worse when it could have been prevented.  I have a little girl to raise and I would hate to have to quit my job so that the state will help me with my surgery or wait until I get cancer to get the help that I need which is going to in turn cost the taxpayers more money on something that could have been prevented. Please help so that I can watch my daughter grow up and enjoy all the things that a parent enjoys with their children.
 
If I can raise enough money for this surgery I can get this problem taken care of and not have to worry about things getting any worse than they already are. I will be able to watch my daughter grow and enjoy parenthood. I will be able to continue to work and provide for my daughter the best that I possibly can.
 
The surgery is going to be around $2,500 and this solely goes to the doctor and surgery center for the procedure. Dr. Evan Wood of West Plains Missouri.
The company that I work for Countryside Pet Supply is going to give a $10 gift certificate for every $100 donation.  This gift certificate will be good for www.countrysidepet.com.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Research helped make illumy, and it’s important to us to give back. So far we have provided pre-production illumy masks for sleep and light therapy research and as a tool to study 40 Hz stimulation for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s studies. We’re excited to expand this program and have committed to donating one illumy to research for each of the first 50 campaign pledges.</p>

<p><br/>To design illumy, we sifted through scientific journals and spoke to sleep experts. Our first challenge was fitting the capabilities we wanted into the mask without making it heavy or bulky. Rather than build buttons and a display onto the mask, we decided to take advantage of a user interface almost everyone already has—a smartphone. This allowed us to ensure that the mask was lightweight and comfortable while effectively blocking external light.</p>
<p>The most challenging nuance was getting the lights right. As we dug through sleep research, a clear picture began to emerge. Humans have developed sensory responses to cues that occur every day in nature, but our modern lifestyle often prevents us from receiving those cues. A sunrise is rich in blue light, and studies have indicated that exposure to blue light in the morning is as effective as a cup of coffee. Red light, on the other hand, is calming and prepares you for bed. We designed our mask to provide light that provokes these natural responses, allowing you to fall asleep faster and to wake more gently and quickly.</p>

<p>At Sound Oasis, we are passionate about helping people to sleep better. Our complete line of products has always focused on helping people fall asleep and stay asleep - naturally. <br/><br/>illumy, the latest product in our line of sleep masks, expands on this goal by recognizing that waking refreshed and relaxed is just as important as falling asleep easily. Waking up to a blaring alarm clock is not only annoying, you often wake up during the deepest part of your sleep, and that can leave you groggy all morning.<br/><br/>illumy was envisioned by our team to let everyone benefit from this science of light<br/>developed for NASA.<br/><br/>We are very proud of this product and very proud of the team that brings it to you. We encourage you to try illumy for yourself and see what a great night's sleep can be.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can you adjust the brightness of the illumy sunset?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes. In the sunset mode, press and hold the sleep button. The red sunset will dim as you hold the button. Release your finger when you have reached your preferred sunset brightness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Will the head strap fit both large and small heads?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, illumy has an adjustable Velcro® strap so it comfortably fits all sizes of heads.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: How does the Sleep Enhancement work? </strong></p>
<p>A: If you suffer from insomnia or need extra help waking up, our optional Sleep Enhancement® technology uses pulsing lights to help. At bedtime, the dimming sunset will pulse at increasingly slower Delta frequencies consistent with falling asleep, and in the morning the “blue sky” light will pulse at increasingly faster Alpha frequencies to assist with waking and alertness. You can turn this feature on or off in the illumy app. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you only adjust the illumy settings with the illumy app on a smartphone or tablet?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, you can also program your illumy using your computer by visiting this page on the Sound Oasis website: <a href=""http://www.glotosleep.com/programmer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.glotosleep.com/programmer/</a>. Select your illumy alarm settings, connect your illumy to the computer with the programming cable, and press the sync button.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Q: Do I need to use illumy every day?</span></strong></p>
<p>A: Everyone is unique. Some people use the sunset every night to distract from racing thoughts and their unreasonably long to-do lists. Some people use the sunset on nights when it’s particularly difficult to fall asleep (the same way a lot of people use our nature sound machines).</p>
<p>Others use illumy during particular seasons of the year. December to March can be pretty dreary in the morning, and one of the best ways to overcome this sleep inertia is with illumy's sunrise.</p>
<p>Over time you’ll find the right combination, but we think a lot of people are going to enjoy illumy every day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Q: Where can I download the illumy app?</span></strong></p>
<p>A: The app can be found here:</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p><strong>Q: How long can I expect the battery to last?</strong><br/><br/>A: If you use illumy every night, you can expect about 2 weeks of battery life. This will depend on your settings, of course. Shorter sunset and sunrise settings will extend this time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: illumy has a washable cover—what is the best way to wash it?</strong><br/><br/>A: The electronics should not be submerged in water, so the best way to wash the cover would be to follow these simple steps:</p>
<p>1.       Remove the strap.</p>
<p>2.       Open the zipper.</p>
<p>3.       Remove the electronics module.</p>
<p>4.       Place the cover and strap in the washing machine and use a gentle wash cycle.</p>
<p>5.       Allow the cover and strap to air dry.</p>
<p>6.       Reinsert the electronics module into the cover and replace the strap. You’re all set for another great night’s sleep!<br/><br/>The foam can also be washed with a mild detergent and warm water using a soft cloth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: When will I receive illumy?</strong><br/><br/>A: We are working to have stock available by April. The earliest backers will receive illumy even sooner, as stock comes off the production line. We’ll do our best to deliver to all of our backers by April 2017. We’ll keep you updated as the campaign progresses and after the campaign, so you’ll always have a good idea of what to expect.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: How do you determine your shipping prices?</strong><br/><br/>A: We use actual shipping prices that we were quoted by various couriers. We chose the best value for each location so your shipping cost is minimized no matter where you are located.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Which countries is the campaign open to?</strong><br/><br/>A: Just about anywhere! We’re using multiple couriers so that we have full worldwide coverage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Does illumy come with a warranty?</strong><br/><br/>A: Yes. Your sleep mask is covered by a one-year replacement warranty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I need Bluetooth to program illumy?</strong></p>
<p>A: We designed illumy to use a platform-independent programming method. Your settings can be synced using most mobile phones, PCs and Mac devices. Since we use audio tones to program illumy, just about any device with a browser and sound output can be used to transfer your settings to your sleep mask. No pairing, no conflicts between multiple devices, and no worries about compatibility.</p>
<p>Of course, the most convenient way to program your sleep mask is using the iPhone or Android app.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I need to use the programming cable to sync my settings?</strong></p>
<p>A: In many cases the programming cable is the most reliable method. However, phones with accurate audio reproduction from the phone’s speaker can be used to program illumy wirelessly through audible tones. Check out our YouTube video to see how it works: </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/nGRX87x8La4"" width=""560""></iframe></div><br/> <p></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will illumy help me stay asleep during the night?</strong></p>
<p>A: It sure does. Illumy is designed to block out external light. If someone turns on the light during the night, you won’t even notice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: I often work night shift; can I use illumy during the day?</strong></p>
<p>A: illumy is ideal for night shift workers who need to sleep during the day. The red sunset helps you relax and prepare for sleep, and the blue sunrise will help you get ready for that next overnighter. The alarm can be set for any time of day or night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Are there other ways I can use illumy?</strong></p>
<p>A: illumy can be used to get a boost in the afternoon. A power nap has been shown to increase productivity while exposure to blue light can boost alertness. Why not combine the two? Set a 10-minute sunrise for 30 minutes from now, put on illumy, and wake up refreshed after a 30-minute nap.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does illumy do sleep tracking?</strong><br/><br/>A: No. We know that most people who are interested in sleep tracking already use a device such as a Fitbit or smartphone app. We focus on accurate light control/illumination and user comfort for the best sleep possible.</p>

Research helped make illumy, and it’s important to us to give back. So far we have provided pre-production illumy masks for sleep and light therapy research and as a tool to study 40 Hz stimulation for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s studies. We’re excited to expand this program and have committed to donating one illumy to research for each of the first 50 campaign pledges.
Are you an academic or medical researcher? Get in touch with us and let us know how illumy could help your studies! We can provide customized software for your application.
 



 

 

 

 

 

 

To design illumy, we sifted through scientific journals and spoke to sleep experts. Our first challenge was fitting the capabilities we wanted into the mask without making it heavy or bulky. Rather than build buttons and a display onto the mask, we decided to take advantage of a user interface almost everyone already has—a smartphone. This allowed us to ensure that the mask was lightweight and comfortable while effectively blocking external light.
The most challenging nuance was getting the lights right. As we dug through sleep research, a clear picture began to emerge. Humans have developed sensory responses to cues that occur every day in nature, but our modern lifestyle often prevents us from receiving those cues. A sunrise is rich in blue light, and studies have indicated that exposure to blue light in the morning is as effective as a cup of coffee. Red light, on the other hand, is calming and prepares you for bed. We designed our mask to provide light that provokes these natural responses, allowing you to fall asleep faster and to wake more gently and quickly.
(NASA uses similar light patterns in the space station to help astronauts regulate their sleep cycles—read more here.)
 

 

 
 
“I've grown dependent on the mask to sleep while traveling as many hotels don't have reliable blackout curtains. Also use at home on nights when I have to wake at a very early hour as it's light out when I go to bed.""- Josh H.United Airlines Pilot
 
""Really nice looking product and excellent quality. The blue morning light is excellent and it is nice to be able to adjust the wake up time. It is blocking out light 100% from the outside without any problems. The app is very good""- Michael von der ReckeDenmark
“I'm very impressed! Overall a comfortable mask and it stayed on well all night. The app is very simple and easy to use.”- Joe W.
 
""Congratulations on illumy, it is an impressive device. It seems very well made and is quite comfortable.""-Justyn BUK

</div></div>","Your dirty pillowcase is the leading cause of breakouts & damaged hair.
 Sleep Away is a product designed out of a necessity. Our team had grown tired of placing clean t-shirts or towels over our pillows each night. We wanted a clean sleeping surface, but doing Laundry Everyday was out of the question.

So we decided to look at what is wrong with current pillowcases. And after identifying a few crucial flaws we knew where to take our own pillowcase project. 

We set out to design a pillowcase perfect for travel & nightly use in the home. Easier to change than other pillowcases and available in sets to help you avoid the wash. Soft, 100% bamboo fabric that is antibacterial, anti-fungal, anti-odor. Wake up in the morning feeling refreshed with less breakouts, bed head & damaged hair










Sleep Away in ColorSleep Away is available in both White and Black. 
For the final model, the velcro of the white pillowcase will have white velcro, and the black model, black velcro.


Our velcro has an Open/Close average of 10,000 times and bamboo requires 1/3 of the water to wash when compared with cotton.Each Sleep Away comes with a mesh washing bag to help protect your velcro and bamboo cases in the wash.



SizingWe are bringing our standard twin sized (20""x26"") pillowcases to you. We wanted to also add King & Queen sized pillowcases to our inventory.1. King Sized Pillowcases (20"" x  36"")2. Queen Sized Pillowcases (20"" x  30"")  
What We Need & What You Get
We are asking for $5,000 to keep our production line both ongoing & growing. 
This money will allow us to produce and ship standard sized pillowcases. The hope is to bring our next product line to fruition through our first and second stretch goals, the king & queen sized pillowcases.



The Impact

Summary</b></p>
<p>Camp Challenge is a one-week summer camp for kids with
cancer and hematological disorders and their siblings. Our goal is to give
campers the same summer camp experience every young boy and girl should get. In
spite of their illnesses, campers play sports, go canoeing, do arts and crafts,
and participate in a myriad of other activities with other kids facing the
same obstacles they are.</p>
<p>We spend all year raising money for Camp so no camper's
family has to pay a dime. The money we raise goes directly into Camp,
paying for things such as transportation, water slides, s'mores, and luau
decorations. Our staff, from doctors to counselors, volunteers their time. </p>
<p>Each year we look forward to putting a smile on our
campers' faces and helping them make the same childhood summer memories that
many of us have had. We hope that you can support Camp Challenge in creating
another great year.</p>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>     On average it costs $750 to sponsor a
camper for the week of camp. Camp Challenge receives more than one hundred
campers a year. The number of campers received is steadily rising. This
campaign will help the camp continue to fund campers for this week of fun.</p>
<p>As a token of our gratitude for assisting in funding
Camperships (Camper SCHOLARSHIPS) we will be offering a few perks. If you
donate $25, we will send you a Camp Challenge postcard. If you donate $50,
we will send you a Camp Challenge pin. If you donate $100, we will send
you a Camp Challenge T-shirts. If you donate $250, we will send you a
Camp Challenge Flag that is signed by the campers and staff.</p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>   
 Camp Challenge is embarking on her 28th year of fun, and we have created
a family environment for children for nearly three decades. Many of our staff
members were campers who returned to volunteer at the camp, because Camp
Challenge is ""Their Happy Place” and they want it to be the same for these
children.</p>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Camp Challenge has yet to turn away a camper, and over the
years, our family has grown. Almost 30 years ago, camp consisted of a handful
of kids and their parents. Today, more than 100 campers attend Camp Challenge
free of cost. That growth requires more counselors and medical staff, more
bunks and meals, and more PRIZES for our famous carnival. The practical
effect of this is Camp has needed to raise considerably more money over time.<br/>
<br/>
Just as Camp has a history of great volunteers who come back year after year,
the organization has also had outstanding relationships with several companies
and individuals who raise money for us. In order to accommodate our growing number of campers, Camp Challenge realizes that it must continue to develop new
sources of funding. We hope Indiegogo is one way we can maintain a free summer
camp for all our new campers.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder 
that affects muscle coordination and leads to mental decline and 
behavioral symptoms. There is no cure for Huntington's Disease. 
Huntington's Disease usually begins between 35 and 44 years of age and 
with a life expectancy of 10 to 25 years in adults and cases starting 
before the age of 21 years life expectancy is only 10 years. Some people
 have described it as having MS, Parkinson and Dementia all in one.

<p>We are raising $40,000. The money we 
raise will be going to ""The Trey Gray Fund for Huntington's Disease"" at 
the Vanderbilt University research center for HD and for covering the 
expenses of traveling 3500 miles. The expenses include renting a support
 vehicle (a small RV) to carry the support team, extra equipment that is
 needed such as spare tires and an extra bike, hotels, gas, a website so
 the public can follow our progress and a PR person to help us get to 
interviews on the different media outlets while we are on the journey. 
It will take us between 35 to 50 days depending on weather, rode 
conditions and the number of interviews that take place. <br/>

Lets make this happen!!
35 Days and 4000 Miles 
My name is Doug Michael and my best friend Trey Gray has Huntington's Disease (HD). 



(Pictured Left to Right) Trey and Doug 2003

While I have supported HD for over a 
decade now I want to do something big to bring awareness to the cause 
and raise money for research. So, I have decided to ride a bike across 
the United States. Your help can bring about more awareness of this 
disease while also helping raise the funds needed to find a cure. If 
everyone who knows someone with HD were to contribute just $2 to this 
cause think about the impact and the difference this would make. Help me
 get the word out and let's make a difference!

What is Huntington's Disease
Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder 
that affects muscle coordination and leads to mental decline and 
behavioral symptoms. There is no cure for Huntington's Disease. 
Huntington's Disease usually begins between 35 and 44 years of age and 
with a life expectancy of 10 to 25 years in adults and cases starting 
before the age of 21 years life expectancy is only 10 years. Some people
 have described it as having MS, Parkinson and Dementia all in one.

   The Journey 

I will be riding a bicycle for about 
3500 from California to New York. I'll be starting at the Rose Bowl in 
Pasadena, CA, then traveling to Nashville, TN and then from there I will
 be heading north to South Bend, IN. After I leave South Bend I will be 
heading east to the Big Apple, New York City, where my ride will end at 
Yankee Stadium. During my ride I will be stopping in communities to do 
interviews on radio, television, newspaper and any other types of media 
outlets telling people about what I am doing and why we need their 
support for HD. I will be taking pictures and posting updates on the 
website that we will be setting up so you can follow the Journey daily. I
 won't be alone, coming with me in the support vehicle and sometimes 
riding himself will be Trey Gray. Some of you may know Trey from his 
work with Huntington's Disease Society of America as their former 
spokesperson,   the HD documentary film Alive and Well that he was in or
 for being a professional musician the last 20 years playing and touring
 with Faith Hill, Jewel, Brooks n Dunn and Ronnie Dunn. 

Trey Gray 2011

We are raising $40,000. The money we 
raise will be going to ""The Trey Gray Fund for Huntington's Disease"" at 
the Vanderbilt University research center for HD and for covering the

<p>Since well before the age of ten, I
noticed a slight change in me, at times feeling irritable, distraught and
lacked a sense of wellbeing and belonging. 
After the premature death of my father from alcoholism, I soon began
drinking and found some bizarre relief by the use of the drink, which was not
related to its intoxicating power. 
Little did I know that for the next forty-five years I would suffer
anxiety, the panic feeling of impending doom and depression, only to be relieved
by a period of drinking alcohol.   However the eventual intoxication and
resulting behaviors often resulted in fights, jails, and rehabilitation centers.
 I sought other drugs for relief.  Finally, federal prison resulted in the loss
of everything, including the desire for life.</p>
<p>I found myself sober because of
confinement, continuing to struggle with the insufferable mental anguish of
sobriety.  My study of medicine led me to
the subject of brain metabolism and I investigated the possibility that brain
metabolism played a role in my symptoms. 
The symptoms were the need to drink alcohol to feel normal and the
misery of sobriety.  </p><p>Not one medical instructor, personal
physician or alcoholism rehabilitation counselor had ever mentioned the
possibility of a genetic metabolic disorder in my brain nor suggested a
metabolic scan of my brain be performed. 
Not even one considered that I drank alcohol for reasons other than intoxication
and selfishness.  Yet, I was led to all
of the evidence needed to propose a new theory. It is clear that as of today,
February 5, 2013, the medical community is completely ignorant of the true
nature of alcoholism and causing harm with their treatment of alcoholism.</p>
<p>An amazing insight ensued as I
followed the trail of information answering a series of needed questions until
the answer lay before me.  Immediately I made
use of the information and within four days experienced that same special
feeling I got from alcohol, without the intoxication or hangover.  I soon was to experience a complete sense of
wellbeing and ability to think clearly while sober.   I grew
towards complete resolution of my sober irritability, melancholy and mental
anguish.  The ‘dry drunk’ was gone.  I was on to something. </p><p>I enthusiastically began sharing
this knowledge with my sober alcoholic friends, they eagerly took the
knowledge, used it in their lives and they too began to experience increased
feelings of wellbeing, calmness, and clear thinking and a decrease in their
particular negative symptoms of sobriety. 
</p>
<p>I  present here the known facts from
the literature and my own personal experience. I propose for the first time in

to a diabetic-type condition.  This creates
a situation whereby the alcoholic brain uses alcohol as fuel or food for the
starving afflicted brain centers with no particular interest in the
intoxicating effects. </p>

 The Natural Science Behind Our Pain Relief Revolution
Each formula has three (3) foundational components for supporting rapid and lasting relief from joint and muscle pain, associated with daily living, sports injuries, arthritis, sprains, bruises and related types of inflammation:
1. Natural Emollients
The base formulations of our ointments and creams are made with all-natural emollients that are readily absorbed by human skin. CBD CLINIC emollients include organic beeswax, jojoba seed oil, cottonseed oil, and shea butter. These were selected and combined via a proprietary method which quickly delivers pain-relieving ingredients into the skin.
Comparatively, many other topical analgesic products use cheap, synthetic ingredients for their base, including benzyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, diglycol stearate, glyceryl monostearate, petrolatum, etc. 2. Powerful Terpenes
Terpenes (C10H16 molecules) produce analgesic action in acute and neuropathic pain by decreasing neuronal excitability through peripheral mechanisms. Menthol and Camphor are the two most widely used terpenes in topical pain management today. Terpenes are aromatic organic hydrocarbons found in the essential oils of plants. They produce the distinct aroma associated with each plant. The therapeutic effects of terpenes are widely recognized. Other terpenes (essential oils) in our products--including Eucalyptus, Tea Tree, Clove, Peppermint and Rich-Hemp extract—are combined with Menthol and/or Camphor.

Grâce à elle, les aidants peuvent vérifier en un clin d’œil si tout va bien chez leur proche et être alerté en cas de problème. Ils sont moins stressés et disposent à tout moment, et depuis n'importe où, de toutes les informations nécessaires.Pour assurer la collecte et la transmission de ces informations, l'application Lili smart repose sur deux autres éléments : une montre et des capteurs.Au démarrage de Lili smart, les capteurs installés au domicile apprennent les habitudes de vie du proche pendant plusieurs jours. Ensuite Lili smart établit automatiquement une moyenne d'activité pour chaque capteur (10 ouvertures de frigo par jour, 3 utilisations du pilulier par jour, etc). Elle se basera sur celle-ci pour évaluer les changements de comportements et donner l'alerte aux aidants.La montre contient une carte SIM et communique avec les capteurs sans réseau Internet. Le domicile du proche aidé n'a pas besoin d'être équipé d'une connexion WiFi. Lili smart détecte les changements de comportement, qu'ils soient liés à l'évolution de la maladie, l'aggravation de troubles ou l'avancée en âge, et alerte automatiquement la famille. Cette fonctionnalité peut concerner l'alimentation (comme  ci-dessous), mais elle peut aussi s'appliquer à la prise des médicaments (capteur pilulier), à l'hygiène (capteur toilettes, porte de douche). 





Installez un capteur sur la porte du réfrigérateur de votre proche et programmez les jours et plages horaires pour les rappels de repas.
Votre proche reçoit les rappels directement sur la montre. Ils s'affichent sous forme de pictogramme avec des vibrations.






Le capteur détecte les mouvements de la porte et les communique via la montre. Si le capteur observe une irrégularité vous en êtes informé.
Vous recevez instantanément une notification via votre application Lili smart pour vous informer que votre proche ne se nourrit potentiellement plus, ou de manière irrégulière.

 Parmi ses fonctions d'alerte, Lili smart prévient aussi les aidants de la sortie du domicile de leur proche afin d'éviter qu'il ne s'égare 





Installez un capteur sur la porte d'entrée de votre proche pour surveiller les sorties du domicile.
Paramétrez les jours et les plages horaires autorisées avec votre application Lili smart.






Lorsque votre proche franchit la porte de son domicile, sa montre affiche automatiquement les noms et les coordonnées des aidants en continu en cas de désorientation.
Vous recevez instantanément une notification via votre application Lili smart pour vous alerter de la sortie de votre proche. Vous pouvez alors le géolocaliser grâce à sa montre.

 Parce que chaque famille est différente et que leurs besoins évoluent dans le temps, Lili smart s’adapte. C’est la raison pour laquelle nous avons créé plus de 50 fonctionnalités pour les assister au quotidien et leur proposer une solution personnalisée. Toutes les fonctionnalitésSécurité

Aymeric et Vincent ont pu y présenter l'application à François Hollande. En ce début d’année 2017, nous disposons d’une solution aboutie dont nous avons récemment lancé la commercialisation sur notre site www.lilismart.com.Aujourd’hui, nous nous sommes donné pour objectif de réunir la somme de 10 000€ pour soutenir notre lancement, pouvoir répondre aux premières demandes et augmenter notre visibilité. Au cours de l’année 2016, nous avons testé Lili smart avec des familles et obtenu des résultats concluants. Notre concept a rencontré un grand succès puisque nous nous sommes vu remettre quatre récompenses :

<h3>ABOUT</h3>
<p>The idea for the Whipper came one afternoon after a climbing session in the scorching 100 degree Sacramento weather. Matt and Laura were talking about their two hobbies, building things and climbing, while walking back to the car. They were also tired of having to write down or memorize the details of their climbing sessions such as which problem they were currently working on and how many routes they climbed in Yosemite last weekend. Eventually, they discussed how amazing it would be if there was a fitness tracker just for rock climbers. That way, they could quantify all of their climbs and optimize their workout sessions. So the Whipper was born!</p>

TIMELINE


ABOUT
The idea for the Whipper came one afternoon after a climbing session in the scorching 100 degree Sacramento weather. Matt and Laura were talking about their two hobbies, building things and climbing, while walking back to the car. They were also tired of having to write down or memorize the details of their climbing sessions such as which problem they were currently working on and how many routes they climbed in Yosemite last weekend. Eventually, they discussed how amazing it would be if there was a fitness tracker just for rock climbers. That way, they could quantify all of their climbs and optimize their workout sessions. So the Whipper was born!

The Story of Spring

We have invented a rolling walker that is smart, elegant, and highly functional. We are putting the user back in control of his or her own life.
Our team of talented designers and engineers, committed to helping people maintain and regain an active lifestyle, have moved from prototype to production. Our experts in New York, Hong Kong and mainland China are evaluating our off-tool samples now. We expect to complete our first production run by late summer and ship to customers in November.  Check Out Our Perks
Back us if you, or someone you know, needs a walker. We will ship it later this year. We will confirm delivery instructions before we ship. Remember that Spring arrives fully assembled, with clear color-coded instructions so that the person opening the box can use it right away.  The box can be saved for storage in a closet.Send a Spring to someone you love!What if you don't need a walker? You can still help us get this revolutionary mobility device into the hands of people who need it.If you want to support our mission but don't need a Spring, you can donate $25. Each time we receive ten $25 donations, we will donate one Spring Walker to an organization such as Heights and Hills, a Brooklyn NY agency serving community-dwelling older adults. We are also partnering with medical clinics, rehabilitation hospitals, and schools who will be receiving models. Back us multiple times if you want to contribute $50, $100 or more.

</div></div>","Using machine learning algorithms, Actofit tracks your motion in 3D to identify your exercise, count your reps, evaluate your form, measure heart rate and calories burned, all automatically without any user disturbance. When you exercise, your motion is tracked and compared to the database of exercises you record, allowing Actofit to successfully detect your exercise and count the number of reps. Force, Power, Velocity is evaluated on every set and you can see the numbers on your mobile apps along with your exercise log.  Every exercise has a specific motion signature. Actofit analyses that pattern to identify your exercise automatically. Here are some examples of how we identify each exercise.Actofit tracks activities to the scale and versatility which has never been done before. This allows for the users to compare and evaluate where they are versus where they want to be, what’s working vs. what's not working and make informed data driven decisions. But don't worry, we still do everything top of the line fitness trackers do!                Built by tech and fitness enthusiasts, Actofit is born out of mere need and a real market gap, with the belief that 10k steps is an inaccurate metric to track fitness since not all exercises involve steps, providing Actofit the competitive edge. Actofit starts where most of the market leader wearables stop. Innovative, versatile and comprehensive.     
               Logging that happened manually, is now automated with data science & logged in mobile apps.               Every little detail is crunched in ranging from the kind of exercise done to the force, velocity and power during a lift; exercise specific calorie burns to the exercise duration.          
 
With every session data logged; compare and evaluate what's working vs. what's not. See where you are against where you want to be. Use this data to make informed decisions; to take your training to new heights.

 

          
Actofit is that unique blend of innovation and versatility, where you can still track steps, sleep, distance, continuous 24 hour heart rate, call/text alerts, calendar notifications apart from your workouts.

 

 




          

Your form is your individual form and may be different than other peoples form. Therefore, we've built an easy to adapt system where our machine learning algorithms adapt to your personal and individual form.

As a result, they have been non competitive to synthetics in developed countries, and too expensive for use in developing countries, until now. By novel inexpensive encapsulation methods with natural materials, and in synergistic combinations with botanical oils, the microencapsulated essential oil products stabilize the essential oils in air and light and have a long term release without phytotoxicity nor do they leave toxic residues per single application, making them a fantastic substitute to synthetic chemical products, and safe for any home application.</p><p>*For those who want to know more about the science behind the Food Protectors, refer to the FAQ section, and if there are further interests don't hesitate to contact us, we would love to give a detailed explanation!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458475909/tuu8inppgjqs7czzq1zk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p> Our powder is therefore green and is a great repellent of insecticides, fungicides, bactericides and nematicides products.

We hope that even before our delivery we can add new fruits and vegetables for the Food Protectors to keep ripe. </p><p>Our main challenge is the movement to large-scale production.

It is an emotional way to share experiences, delicacies, and memories. Unfortunately, we sometimes neglect it and at other times simply cannot control it –so our foods spoil. That’s why we created the Food Protectors! The Food Protectors are silent heroes for every kitchen. They are an organic and safe solution that prevents fruits and vegetables from spoiling at homes!   StylesComing as two attractive designs and with countless colours, the Food Protectors deliver both cuteness and style. Each Protector has a built-in LED light that changes colour over time from green to red, reminding you when to change your powder.The Original Food Protectors come in red and gold (apple) and white (robot)A single Food Protector has enormous powers, stopping spoilage in: All at once!Using the Food Protectors is as simple as one, two, three!Infinitely more efficient, undoubtedly more reliable – this is why you have never seen anything like the Food Protectors.Each fruit or vegetable spoils for different reasons. Reactions to certain environments, development of fungi, and encounters with bacteria all cause different response from each type of produce, causing them to spoil at rates and moments inconsistent with one another. Over the past 12 years, we have outlined these causes, creating specialize powders that actively target the exact bacteria and fungi that cause spoilage in single fruits or vegetables with incredible precision usually attributed to the top chemical companies. Except we are organic.Samples of the specialised powders developed throughout the past twelve years.The beauty of the Food Protectors is the accumulation of all that knowledge into a single, global powder. Our powder is the result of carefully designed combinations of our research, actively targeting the exact causes that lead to spoilage in fruits and vegetables. It successfully focuses on the exact bacterium, fungus, and mushrooms that have negative effects on each and every produce. Thus, we offer a solution that can increase the life of your fruits and vegetables by weeks. This is not you average general solution. It is a calculated attack on the exact components that harm our kitchens. The Food Protectors reach incredible levels of effectiveness and precision, which surpass anything available in the market. Real change is coming to your kitchen.We all suffer from spoilage, so Food Protectors are for everyone! Whether you are:The Food Protectors are an organic and environmentally friendly solution that stops that stops the global harm caused by food waste, including methane gas, water waste, and land lost.Save money on food that end up throwing away, and time wasted on going to the supermarket all the time!The Food Protectors perform magical feats, silently protecting your kitchen from its invisible enemies - bacteria.Backers' RewardsWe use inexpensive microencapsulated essential oil, such as clove, spearmint, thyme, and more to power the Food Protectors. The powder generated from such a process is slowly released into the air, which creates conditions that safely protect ripeness in fruits and vegetables! Essential oils are volatile liquids produced by plants and used by the plant kingdom as natural insecticides, repellants and antimicrobials. They have been known throughout history as effective biopesticides in agriculture, but have been much more expensive than synthetic chemicals as they are volatile and non-stable in air and light, requiring multiple applications. As a result, they have been non competitive to synthetics in developed countries, and too expensive for use in developing countries, until now. By novel inexpensive encapsulation methods with natural materials, and in synergistic combinations with botanical oils, the microencapsulated essential oil products stabilize the essential oils in air and light and have a long term release without phytotoxicity nor do they leave toxic residues per single application, making them a fantastic substitute to synthetic chemical products, and safe for any home application.*For those who want to know more about the science behind the Food Protectors, refer to the FAQ section, and if there are further interests don't hesitate to contact us, we would love to give a detailed explanation! Our powder is therefore green and is a great repellent of insecticides, fungicides, bactericides and nematicides products. It is even edible!The capabilities of our powder go beyond households. By becoming as effective as chemical preservatives, different combinations of materials can be used for preservation in shipment, storage, and agricultural growth of fruits and vegetables. This can and will continue to reduce food waste in an environmentally friendly way for every sector of the industry. Micro encapsulation by itself is an extremely effective tool in a verity of sectors. Its ability to control substances and their release rate has potential all over the consumer world – from flowers to makeup. We already have plans in place to develop an organic preservative for plants, and are looking at possibilities to increase the effectiveness of cosmetics, such as significantly extending the timeframe of the smell of deodorants. Food waste is a global concern that affects us all. A growing population means we continue to struggle for food provision, and continual food waste leads to worsening global warming. Every year, food wasted results in the loss of:The team that leaded us to this moment is composed of countless brilliant minds over the past decade. They have each contributed immensely to every crucial piece of research, ensuring that we remain organic in every step of the way while making constant strides.Today, the core team that pushes Food Protectors forwards is made of the combination of youth and excitement with experience and ingenuity. Arie Markus is the leading scientist, who invented the technology and has been working on it for over twelve years. He is our Einstein, mentally and physically! Amit Gal-Or is the founder, running both front and backend operations in bringing the Food Protectors to you. Andy Sui runs legal operations and provides strategic planning. WK Chiu is the man behind much of our cool technologies for the container and the packaging.Risks and ChallengesFor the past twelve years, our scientists have created many types of powders for many types of fruits and vegetables. Yet since June, we have been actively working on the Food Protectors’ all-inclusive powder that treats almost all fruits and vegetables.Over the coming months, we will continue to add more and more fruits and vegetables to the treated list. However, this takes time and testing, as we use active ingredients that target the specific problems in the produce. This is not a risk, but our challenge in continuing to improve our product so that you can rip the benefits. We hope that even before our delivery we can add new fruits and vegetables for the Food Protectors to keep ripe. Our main challenge is the movement to large-scale production. We have been working closely with our manufacturer of the containers, and have in place a lab to create the powder. Now we need to put them together and ensure quality control, so that you can have the best possible experience.From the beginning of the campaign until every product is delivered, we will keep you updated with our progress. We will handle unexpected issues or delays with transparency, and will do our utmost best to answer all your questions and comments.We are very excited to go through this journey with you, and bring you all a Protector to your kitchen.",31.0,3,"1 Campaign

<h3>SAVE ELLIE'S HOME </h3>
<p><span>Hi, I am Ellie's mommy and to be quite honest I am very unsure about what to say or write here. But I am a mom and as a mom, I will do whatever it takes to help my baby.My beautiful Ellie was born dec. 22,2010. The absolute best Christmas present any person could ask for. She is perfect and a complete joy. Her smile is contagious and absolutely lights up the room. Ellie appeared to be perfectly healthy until she was about 8 weeks old. At her well baby check up we were rushed to hospital for an evaluation to determine why she seemed to be having laboured breathing... She had a few small tests done and was referred to cardiology and respirology. we didn't realize that Ellies little body was too stressed to even wait for those referrals and before she could get in to see any specialists Ellie was admitted her first time. She was quite sick, our pastor came in and we were asked if we would like to have Ellie baptized. I couldn't do it! I felt that baptizing her meant I was giving up on Ellie, that I felt she was not strong enough to fight this! Whatever ""this"" was! Ellie was in hospital 2 weeks, and underwent dozens of tests with, of course no answers. We should have been home, enjoying those precious first weeks of her life. Her big sister Avery who was only 2, could not understand why suddenly mommy was gone and the peaceful days after Ellie's birth had suddenly become tearful, stressful worried days. Ellie finally was discharged and once home, we thought we could get back to just living. We were an average family, we loved our church, we volunteered at the homeless shelter serving meals, loved being involved in our community and helping whenever we knew of people who needed Help. We are actually quite a large family. Ellie is blessed to have 7 other siblings! She is the baby! We have taught our older children to love all people and be involved in their community.It was not long, in fact it was within 3 weeks and Ellie was being rushed back to our children's hospital by ambulance. This time in extreme respiratory distress and vomiting on herself and loosing consciousness. This time we were admitted for a longer time as doctors struggled to figure out what on earth was wrong with her. Cystic fibrosis was the number one suspect but the tests all came back negative. </span></p>
<p><span>Ultimately after several tests it was determined that Ellie must have, childhood interstitial lung disease. This is very rare and finding the sub type would require biopsies of her lungs.Several emergency visits, admissions and scares later. Ellie was admitted for her biopsy which found that she has perhaps the rarest form of ILD. There are 19 people worldwide with her subtype. Ellie was number 18 to be diagnosed with folicular bronchiolitis And NEHI cells.</span></p>
<p><span>She lives her life tethered to oxygen tubing and with a feeding tube. She is on a ventilator for all sleeps in an effort to preserve her lungs so we can potentially hold off a lung transplant. Ellie's future is uncertain, she loves life even though several times a day she throws up from her laboured breathing, or she has episodes in which she stops breathing and looses counsciousness. In fact, this has become her normal. No 22 month old baby should know this as there normal. It breaks my heart as her mom. We are a close family but do not have the support of family as most people do, except for my brother and wonderful sister in law. Ellie and Avery don't have the blessing of being loved on by grandparents. We have always worked hard to provide for our children ourselves. I struggled and put myself through school to become a paramedic, this was my dream and with Ellie's health, I am not able to go back tO work. I am her nurse, her primary caregiver and I am her mommy. I wouldn't leave this babies side now, not for any amount of money. Not to mention, we are not in a position to hire a nurse to care for her in order for me to work. it would be financially impossible. My husband is a ceramic tile installer. His job counts on him being there. If Ellie is sick, he looses contracts. Income is very limited to begin with, a lost contract is devestating on top of the heartache of watching our baby fight for her life.</span></p>
<p><span>ellie has had an episode in ICU, admitted and on life support with no explanation for why she could not breathe on her own. We were simply told, it can happen at any time and we never know which of these episodes would be the one that she does not come out of.</span></p>
<p><span>because of her immuno compromised status and poor lung function our home is our safe place! Our home is all we have and it is where we spend ALL of our time. Loosing the luxury of staying here is devestating. We live isolated from friends and the little family we have as nobody can be here if they have even so much as a sniffle. This applies even if they have been around someone else who is sick. It means Christmas, thanksgiving, birthday celebrations are moray often spent by ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span>one thing I have learnt with Ellie and her health is to truly not take life for granted or any of our abilities. And I've learnt perspective is so important in life. Do I think my Ellie suffers more than a child with cancer or EB or the multitudes of diseases I've encountered due to having my own chronically ill child, NO I don't but this is MY baby and I need to do everything in my power to make her life stable. I just feel this is not even in my control now.we are just not ""takers"", we are a family that gives back and any blessings that come to us will certainly not be in vain.</span></p>
<p><span>THE GOAL...</span></p>
<p><span>Ive been asked what the actual goal is... Our hearts desire is to buy this house. That being said, we know that's a huge ""wish"" and this may be impossible.  We hope that the funds raised will allow this to happen and that the campaign will ""get noticed"" allowing us to help other families also. If there are not enough funds to secure this home, maybe another will come up but our hopes are that we can actually buy something and not have to move Ellie. </span></p>
<p><span>If the funds raised to not allow for any of these goals, they will be put into Ellie's account in trust. we also planned that IF the house could be purchased, it would also be for Ellie.I'm not sure of the legalities etc. but we would want to secure it as Ellie's home.</span></p>

I'm reaching out to all of you guys for a cause that is near and dear to me, The Shannon Smith Medical Benefit. Shannon Smith, the 29 year old native of Buffalo New York, has a very unique story. While living in Las Vegas and pregnant with her second child, she went to the hospital because of pneumonia complications. Her condition worsened, and she eventually developed a near fatal blood disease called sepsis, but her case was one of the worst cases anyone had ever seen. </p>
<p>Shannon not only lost her child, but the sepsis was so severe that in order to survive, she had to have all of her limbs amputated. So Shannon became a rare quadruple amputee case in this country. She eventually moved back to Buffalo from Las Vegas, and her mom took an early retirement to care for her daughter. Shannon is courageously fighting to live a normal life, but that wouldn't come without setbacks,  one being the MASSIVE medical expenses she incurred. While in the hospital Shannon incurred over ONE MILLION DOLLARS in medical expenses. Another setback she has is her home not having handicap accessibility. It is becoming burdensome for her family to carry her up and down several flights of stairs each day. </p>
<p>My organization, Capital Change, decided this was certainly a cause to get behind. This is particularly dear to me, as Shannon and I were very close friends when we were growing up, going through high school. We went our separate paths, but divine intervention allowed us to cross paths again, and God placed it in my heart to do something for Shannon. That's why, through my organization, I have come up with a goal to raise $10,000 for Shannon by December 1, 2012 to help cover her medical expenses and to purchase a handicap accessibility ramp for her to get up and down the stairs in her home. We will be presenting the check to Shannon at our 30 Under 30 Awards Gala which is taking place December 1, 2012. </p>

<strong>Fundraiser for Oumar Cisse, known as Peace Corps Baba</strong>
<p>Help us raise funds for Baba’s urgently needed surgery, scheduled for November 12 in France.</p>
<p>Our dear friend, Oumar Cisse, known to most of the world as Peace Corps Baba, needs our help.  Baba makes his living as an art merchant, living in Mopti, Mali.  He is an ambassador for Mail, traveling to neighboring countries, the US and Europe, selling ethnic jewelry and textiles of the many artisans of his country, and in the process supports hundreds of fellow Malians and their families. <strong>Baba’s life’s work has always been more than selling jewelry, beads and textiles. It is about serving people – uplifting, mentoring, inspiring, providing opportunity to the people of his area of the world.</strong> He is the selfless friend to the young and old who work with him, his neighbors,  to travelers who never forget him, to fellow exporters and importers. He is a legend throughout West Africa and a mention of him elicits immediate respect. There is no wonder why the Peace Corps honored him with his title of Peace Corps Baba.</p>
<p><strong>Peace Corps Baba never asks for anything in return for all that he does. But now, he needs help. A couple weeks ago he was diagnosed liver cancer requiring medical attention immediately.  His surgery, which will be done in France, has been delayed until 55,000 Euro can be raised.  Recovery and treatment for this will be costly as well.  The need for this funding is very urgent! </strong></p>
<p>Please join those of us who know and love him by donating what you can.  In addition to your contributions, we need you to <strong>pass this request on to people in your network</strong>, your face book friends, your blogs and tweets.  <strong>Many small donations will make it so we can reach or exceed our goal of raising $10k by October 24.</strong></p>
<p>As a young man he worked as a language instructor to new Mali Peace Corps volunteers, and was encouraged by them to build a business out of the beaded jewelry he created. Over the past 30 years he has returned the benefits he received from PCV several hundred fold.  His selfless existence is in service of his people, his West African country, and the friends he has made from around the world.  He makes sure hundreds of Malian artisans have work and that Malian exports are known for their traditional origins and quality.  He is a peacemaker - the one that people come to solve property, family, and neighborhood disputes.  People line up in the evening outside of his home to talk to him asking for money for food for their families and opportunity to succeed – no one leaves without his encouragement and enough food or money to feed their family for the next day.</p>
<p>Peace Corps Baba is in love with life and gives of himself every waking hour. He is devoted to his family, a loyal friend, a national treasure and a model for what is right in the world.  At a time when Mali is experiencing devastating infrastructure deterioration, he cannot look to his neighbors and friends at home to help.  This man is most deserving. With many people providing a donation, we can put a significant dent in the expenses he is accruing to stabilize his health and continue to be the important person he is in the world.</p>

Over the past 30 years he has returned the benefits he received from PCV several hundred fold.  His selfless existence is in service of his people, his West African country, and the friends he has made from around the world.  He makes sure hundreds of Malian artisans have work and that Malian exports are known for their traditional origins and quality.  He is a peacemaker - the one that people come to solve property, family, and neighborhood disputes.  People line up in the evening outside of his home to talk to him asking for money for food for their families and opportunity to succeed – no one leaves without his encouragement and enough food or money to feed their family for the next day.
Peace Corps Baba is in love with life and gives of himself every waking hour. He is devoted to his family, a loyal friend, a national treasure and a model for what is right in the world.  At a time when Mali is experiencing devastating infrastructure deterioration, he cannot look to his neighbors and friends at home to help.  This man is most deserving. With many people providing a donation, we can put a significant dent in the expenses he is accruing to stabilize his health and continue to be the important person he is in the world.
 “Show your support for a great man, contribute TODAY and make TOMORROW a better world for one man, his family, our tribe, two nations, ONE WORLD!”  SS",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Willow Cannan, our 3-year-old baby girl, was diagnosed in May 2016 with an ultra-rare and deadly genetic disorder known as Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency (MSD), which is a Lysosomal  Storage Disease. Only 30+ people in the world suffer with this degenerative disease, with many not living past the age of 10, since it targets the Central Nervous system, Lungs, Eyes, and many other major organs. MSD builds up proteins in the lysosomes, making it extremely difficult for the patient's cells, and therefore body, to work.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">But for the first time ever, a team of scientists and physicians are on the cusp of a miracle break through that would save our daughter and the other few children suffering from this dreadful disease. The only way to make this happen is by raising enough funds to privately finance the trial runs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481158054/wzq0uu3hlvgdvhnzzr9v.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Willow's Journey</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our youngest daughter <strong>Willow was born on August 21, 2013</strong> at 8.5 pounds, following a very normal pregnancy and C-section. Soon after, we began to notice that her weight and height weren't increasing by much, leaving Willow in the 0% percentile on the growth chart. Even now, at 3 years old, Willow only weighs 25 pounds and hasn't gained any weight in the last year. Although she was small, she played and developed, we didn't know anything was wrong at first.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>At 18 months old</strong>, Willow began to crawl and walk, which was a bit later than our two older daughters. While attending daycare daily, her runny nose and ear infections grew constant but were attributed to being around and playing with other sick children all day. Willow is non-verbal, and has never talked, which began to spark minor theories within our family: either the ear infections were inflaming her adenoids, which would block her from hearing well, or she just never felt the need to communicate since her two older sisters would speak on her behalf (just like all older siblings tend to do).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>At 23 months old</strong> (Summer '15), Willow visited a speech therapist who immediately noticed that she had a both a tongue tie and a lip tie. Hoping that a simple surgery could resolve her speech issues, we traveled to a dental specialist for a surgery consultation but were told that further tests should be conducted before resorting to the surgery.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">At this same time, Willow's skin became very dry, resulting in 'cradle cap' and severely dry skin on her front and back. A local dermatologist prescribed her medical-grade shampoo, and we continue to jot down each of Willow's symptoms, not knowing if these diagnoses were connected or simply coincidental.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>At 29 months old</strong> (January '16), Willow's pediatrician referred us to an endocrinologist and a pediatric neurologist for further assessment. The endocrinologist examined her blood for hormonal imbalances or anything else that could be affecting her body, but all tests essentially came back normal. We then met with the neurologist (Dr. Lee) next, assuming he'd be reviewing scans of Willow's brain for signs of tumors, but he instead insisted that we look deeper into genetic testing after hearing about the numerous symptoms she's been experiencing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In the last year, we have learned more about genetics than we ever thoughts possible. In short, every human body is made up of cells, which contain our individually unique DNA makeup. <strong>Our DNA is essentially a recipe book, made up of 20,000 genes, or pages in the book</strong>. Every single human has at least 5 pages containing misspellings or errors, and in most people, the 5-or-so incorrect pages aren't enough to cause bodily issues. However, some pages might be missing entirely (called deletions), which triggers a new recipe for disaster in a small percentage of people.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">With the dedication and knowledge of Dr. Lee, we were able to identify that <strong>Willow had a deletion of one her genetic pages</strong>. Without this finding, we may have never figured out the next step to saving our baby girl.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Following months of intrusive testing, Willow's screening declared her positive as a 'carrier' of Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency (MSD).

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency (MSD)?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Short Answer:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Children with Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency, or MSD, are born with a mutation of the SUMF1 gene, which means the body does not create Sulfatase enzymes and is unable to break down and recycle natural cellular waste. This results in the loss of all body function and the disease is ultimately fatal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481163599/coeyudgppfwch4anvx8e.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Long Answer (Scientific):</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Willow’s disease, MSD, is caused by a defective SUMF1 gene, and as explained above, this gene normally acts to activate enzymes in the body called “Sulfatases.”  Without functional Sulfatases, toxic material builds up in the lysosomes. There are many other diseases that are caused by a single missing Sulfatase (17 to be exact), including 'MPS I-VII' and 'Metachromatic Leukodystrophy'.  Since all Sulfatases are activated by the SUMF1 gene, SUMF1 gene therapy would not only help treat MSD, but help enhance treatment of these other diseases as well.  Scientists have proven the primary role of the SUMF1 gene in the treatment of several of the diseases mentioned above, which could altogether help save over 100,000 (MPS alone occurs in 1/25,000 births) children worldwide.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency (MSD) is a condition that mainly affects the brain, skin, and skeleton. Because the signs and symptoms of MSD vary widely, researchers have split the condition into three types: Neonatal, Late-infantile, and Juvenile.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">1) The 'Neonatal Type' is the most severe form, with signs and symptoms appearing soon after birth.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">2) The 'Late-Infantile type' is the most common form of Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency and is characterized by normal cognitive development in early childhood followed by a progressive loss of mental abilities and movement (psychomotor regression) due to Leukodystrophy or other brain abnormalities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">3) The 'Juvenile Type' is the rarest form of Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency. Signs and symptoms of the 'Juvenile Type' appear in mid to late childhood. Affected individuals have normal early cognitive development but then experience psychomotor regression; however, the regression in the 'Juvenile Type' usually occurs at a slower rate than in the 'Late-Infantile Type'.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">How Can We Find a Cure?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">There are several young MSD children that can be treated, causing the disease to be stopped and lives to be saved.  We are starting a patient group called the 'United MSD Foundation' and a patient registry is being developed as well, since we are also actively trying to find more patients.  Every doctor I talk to knows of a child somewhere who we can reach out to, but that still doesn't change the fact that we just had no solutions or options before now.</p>

</div></div>","Willow Cannan, our 3-year-old baby girl, was diagnosed in May 2016 with an ultra-rare and deadly genetic disorder known as Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency (MSD), which is a Lysosomal  Storage Disease. Only 30+ people in the world suffer with this degenerative disease, with many not living past the age of 10, since it targets the Central Nervous system, Lungs, Eyes, and many other major organs. MSD builds up proteins in the lysosomes, making it extremely difficult for the patient's cells, and therefore body, to work.
But for the first time ever, a team of scientists and physicians are on the cusp of a miracle break through that would save our daughter and the other few children suffering from this dreadful disease. The only way to make this happen is by raising enough funds to privately finance the trial runs.
 

 
Willow's Journey
 
Our youngest daughter Willow was born on August 21, 2013 at 8.5 pounds, following a very normal pregnancy and C-section. Soon after, we began to notice that her weight and height weren't increasing by much, leaving Willow in the 0% percentile on the growth chart. Even now, at 3 years old, Willow only weighs 25 pounds and hasn't gained any weight in the last year. Although she was small, she played and developed, we didn't know anything was wrong at first.
At 18 months old, Willow began to crawl and walk, which was a bit later than our two older daughters. While attending daycare daily, her runny nose and ear infections grew constant but were attributed to being around and playing with other sick children all day. Willow is non-verbal, and has never talked, which began to spark minor theories within our family: either the ear infections were inflaming her adenoids, which would block her from hearing well, or she just never felt the need to communicate since her two older sisters would speak on her behalf (just like all older siblings tend to do).
At 23 months old (Summer '15), Willow visited a speech therapist who immediately noticed that she had a both a tongue tie and a lip tie. Hoping that a simple surgery could resolve her speech issues, we traveled to a dental specialist for a surgery consultation but were told that further tests should be conducted before resorting to the surgery.
At this same time, Willow's skin became very dry, resulting in 'cradle cap' and severely dry skin on her front and back. A local dermatologist prescribed her medical-grade shampoo, and we continue to jot down each of Willow's symptoms, not knowing if these diagnoses were connected or simply coincidental.
At 29 months old (January '16), Willow's pediatrician referred us to an endocrinologist and a pediatric neurologist for further assessment. The endocrinologist examined her blood for hormonal imbalances or anything else that could be affecting her body, but all tests essentially came back normal. We then met with the neurologist (Dr. Lee) next, assuming he'd be reviewing scans of Willow's brain for signs of tumors, but he instead insisted that we look deeper into genetic testing after hearing about the numerous symptoms she's been experiencing.
In the last year, we have learned more about genetics than we ever thoughts possible. In short, every human body is made up of cells, which contain our individually unique DNA makeup. Our DNA is essentially a recipe book, made up of 20,000 genes, or pages in the book. Every single human has at least 5 pages containing misspellings or errors, and in most people, the 5-or-so incorrect pages aren't enough to cause bodily issues. However, some pages might be missing entirely (called deletions), which triggers a new recipe for disaster in a small percentage of people.
With the dedication and knowledge of Dr. Lee, we were able to identify that Willow had a deletion of one her genetic pages. Without this finding, we may have never figured out the next step to saving our baby girl.
Following months of intrusive testing, Willow's screening declared her positive as a 'carrier' of Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency (MSD). After being reassured by Dr. Lee that Willow being a carrier didn't mean she was diagnosed with MSD. She could just simply be a carrier, passed down through family genetics. Willow's blood was drawn again and we were forced to wait the longest 4 weeks of our lives to see if she actually had MSD.
At 33 months old (May '16), we received the confirmation from Dr. Lee that Willow did in fact have MSD. We will never forget that phone call that changed our lives forever.
Since MSD was such a rare occurrence, it proved difficult for us to find a Geneticist who had the proper experience (or at least dealt with one previous MSD patient). We finally landed an appointment with Dr. Kirmse at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, which meant a lot since he had previously worked with two other MSD children, both who never left the hospital.
While waiting for our upcoming appointment with Dr. Kirmse, we were introduced to a friend of a friend who had recently lost their 8 year old daughter to MSD. How coincidental that someone within our network was struggling with the same disease even though there are only about 30 known cases globally. From there, we were introduced to a private group meant for families dealing with this tragic disease, which led us to a father of an MSD child in Ireland. This changed everything because the father was already communicating with researchers and scientists in Italy who could potentially mutate the incorrect, or deleted, gene pages if enough funding was provided. The Irish father had already raised 500,000 Euros to rid this disease from the planet.
FINALLY, THERE WAS HOPE.
We flew to Cambridge, UK in the summer of 2016 to meet with scientists from across the world.  They showed us the science is there, they just need funding and time.  Back at home Willow's 14 year old sister, learned of Gene Therapy through science.  ""Why can't they just do that for Willow?""  
 
 

 
Our friends and family helped us create the campaign ""Warriors for Willow"" and our South Mississippi Community has rallied around us raising funds through fundraisers and private donations.  Our community support gave us hope that maybe we can fund the research to save Willow and the other children with MSD.

<h3>
<em>We are asking for your help my wife Cindy, mother of three, get the life savin</em><em>g procedjure she needs to be around a long time</em>
</h3>
<p>During her first pregnancy in 1991 Cindy was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, which in some cases will just go away after pregnancy. In her case it did not, the diabetes remained and developed into type II diabetes. Since then it has been a constant struggle for her to keep her weight down. She has dieted, exercised, and tried every different type weight loss. Cindy continued to struggle with the diabetes and weight through two more pregnancies, managing her sugar levels thru insulin use.</p>
<p>Year after year her natural insulin levels decreased, doctors have had her on every medication that has come out, several which had major side effects, including heart problems and weight gain. All the time the doctors are telling her to lose weight the medications they are giving her are causing her to gain weight.</p>
<p>Cindy has always tried not to let this condition keep her from raising her family and remaining active through kids sports, being a super soccer mom, and team mom for 15 years! She always keeps up with all the kids’ activities. As well as working full time as an Assistant CPA doing corporate taxes &amp; payroll.</p>
<p>In 2009, she was told that a new study showed that gastric bypass surgery can not only help her loose the weight she has been fighting for years, but also lower or completely remove her dependency in insulin, and could quite possibly cure her type II diabetes. We were all very excited about this news!</p>
<p>The first thing we did is sign up for a seminar with the KC Bariatric Center, and they felt Cindy was a great candidate for the surgery and gave us several different options. At that time we had very good insurance with Coventry. We went through all the steps filled out all the forms and submitted to the insurance company to get it pre approved. After about a 3 week wait we received a letter from Coventry stating that the procedure was not covered, because my employer had choose to remove that coverage from our policy.  After several months and multiple attempts to get my company to reinstate that portion of coverage, we gave up and started a savings fund to get her surgery.</p>
<h3><em>That’s when the unthinkable happened, June 2010 </em></h3>
<p>I came home from work and Cindy was sitting in a chair in the corner staring off into space, I went over to her and asked what was wrong and when she answered she was not making any sense, she was slurring her words and wasn’t sure where she was or what was wrong, she was completely confused and scared.  So I rushed her to the emergency room, it turns out at 46 year old she had a stroke. They immediately hospitalized her in ICU for 3 days then moving her to their stroke center for another 7 days. The stroke mostly affected her memory and some of her motor skills. She had trouble remembering events and doing simple arithmetic, along with terrible mood swings. Between all the doctors &amp; hospital bills along with treatments, we found our savings disappeared quickly. I didn't care my only concern was getting Cindy better.</p>
<p>Thus began our next challenge which made the others pale in comparison, getting Cindy back to herself.</p>
<p>It has been a long road since June 2010, many changes. Shortly after Cindy’s stroke I became injured on the job, and was promptly let go. This left us with no insurance and with Cindy’s medical conditions, impossible for us to get her any insurance, at least any we could afford and would cover any pre-existing conditions.  We did manage to get her on Social Security Disability, which has helped. But to our surprise SSD has a two and a half year period before they cover any medical with Medicare. The one thing she needs the most she can’t get. Even the state programs were no help, since she was getting SSD, she didn't quailfy for state medicare. This left us having to cover any medical straight out of pocket.</p>
<p>Over the past 2 years Cindy has made great improvements, she is able to get around pretty well, but does require a cane to keep her balance, she suffers from migraine headaches from the stroke. But surprisingly, she keeps in good spirits. She is still battling her diabetes and weight, but with her disabilities from her stroke she is not able to exercise and stay as active as she could before her stroke.</p>
<p>Cindy has gotten to a point in her recovery where if she was able to lose the extra weight and get the diabetes under control she would be able to get back to a normal life, where she could get out and spend more time with our son, and remove some of the stress the weight has put on her knees and back.</p>
<p>We are asking for donations to fund the Gastric Bypass Surgery &amp; recovery expeneses along with her continuing health care needs. We can't help that think if she had gotten the surgery that it might have prevented Cindy's Stroke.</p>
<p>Our goal is to get Cindy back to a healthly weight and to control the diabetes so she can live a long and heathly life.</p>
<p>If you’ve gotten this far reading about Cindy’s Story I want to thank you for at least reading it, and thank you even more if you decide to help by donate to our cause to help Cindy get her life back, every little bit helps!</p>

Over the past 2 years Cindy has made great improvements, she is able to get around pretty well, but does require a cane to keep her balance, she suffers from migraine headaches from the stroke. But surprisingly, she keeps in good spirits. She is still battling her diabetes and weight, but with her disabilities from her stroke she is not able to exercise and stay as active as she could before her stroke.
Cindy has gotten to a point in her recovery where if she was able to lose the extra weight and get the diabetes under control she would be able to get back to a normal life, where she could get out and spend more time with our son, and remove some of the stress the weight has put on her knees and back.
We are asking for donations to fund the Gastric Bypass Surgery & recovery expeneses along with her continuing health care needs. We can't help that think if she had gotten the surgery that it might have prevented Cindy's Stroke.
Our goal is to get Cindy back to a healthly weight and to control the diabetes so she can live a long and heathly life.
If you’ve gotten this far reading about Cindy’s Story I want to thank you for at least reading it, and thank you even more if you decide to help by donate to our cause to help Cindy get her life back, every little bit helps!

<p>Donations to <strong><em>Ink is Hip</em></strong> will be used for double hip surgery and rehabilitation expenses for Penelope, Owner and Queen Bee Tattoo Artist at Chameleon Ink Tattoo &amp; Body Piercing. Penelope, loved and respected by many, is well known in the Bellingham, Washington tattoo community.</p>
<p><strong><em>“Those who know Penelope might describe her personality as somewhere between outgoing and outrageous. When people meet her they seldom forget her.”</em></strong></p>
<p>Penelope is young for someone who requires hip replacement surgery.

<p><strong><em>Our goal is to raise $14,000 by September 30, 2012. We ask you to contribute whatever you can afford, from $5 to $500 or more.  You can donate as often as you like.  </em></strong></p>

<p>First we want to say thank you and welcome to all of our BBB supporters! My name is Kevin Barringer. My business partner, Fernando Ornelas, and I need your help to raise $375,000, to open a our own Functional Training (Think CrossFit) Body Boxing Fitness Center. We need the money to lease, renovate and equip a new kick butt training facility as well as cover the operating/marketing expenses for the first year of operation.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>About BBB!</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Body Boxing Bootcamp was created to be something totally original and different from the traditional modes of
fitness workouts or other boot camps!</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Body Boxing focuses on sculpting the entire body thru a combination of various types of fitness training such as Boxing/Thai Kick Boxing, Resistance Training (rubber bands and light weight lifting), Plyometrics (jumping and quick movement drills), Calisthenics (using one's own body weight), Obstacle Courses, Circuit Training, Parachute Running, and anything else we can dream up for the day! </span><br/></p>
<p>We do this in a very unique way by breaking down each one-hour class into 12-15 min intense workout sections (Warm up &amp; Abs, Strength &amp; Conditioning, Speed &amp; Agility, Boxing/Thai Kick Boxing), which is great for keeping workouts fresh and fun so that clients never get bored and are always challenged. <br/></p>
<p>Body Boxing Bootcamp services everyone including beginners, advanced fitness enthusiast, overweight kids, baby boomers as well as many celebrities living in Bel Air, Beverly Hills, Park La Brea,  Hollywood, West Hollywood, West Los Angeles, and Mid Wilshire Area of Southern California (CA).<br/></p>
<p></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Benefits of Joining Our Body Boxing Bootcamps</strong><br/></p>
<p>Common benefits discovered by beginner Bootcamp students are loss of weight and body fat combined with increased self-confidence after committing to a course. Advanced students find the routines challenging and fun and are always pushed to new heights they never thought possible!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The BBB Staff has 30 Years of Fitness Experience</strong></p>
<p>Combined we have a total of 30 years of experience working in the physical fitness industry.  We got into the industry not as a career move, but as a lifestyle choice to improve our physical health and well-being.  Being that we were overweight children carrying over into our early adulthood, we turned to fitness training and boxing as a way to lose weight, build confidence and gain control over our physical lives.</p>
<p>In order to help adults as well as children achieve their fitness goals and gain self confidence, we started Body Boxing Bootcamp in 2008 and developed it into a successful business with over 60 customers, 75% of which have been with us from the very start.  We now want to expand our Body Boxing operations and increase our marketing reach by leveraging a physical, mortar-and-brick Bootcamp location. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Building a BBB Fitness Center has many Benefits</strong></p>
<p>A centralized Body Boxing facility will allow our members to take their training to the next level! In addition, our members will have access to locker rooms affording them more time to enjoy the full benefits of a BBB class without having to dash home before going to work! It will provide secure parking lots as well as protection from inclement weather, a current problem of hosting classes in an outdoor environment.</p>
<p>A Body Boxing Bootcamp Workout Center will give us a home base for our operations and boot camp classes. It will also provide our business with a much better marketing opportunity to increase our BBB's brand visibility, and lure customers away from competing fitness centers. Curious customers will now be able to stop by our new fitness center to visit with staff members and/or take a ""free"" trial class before signing up for our more affordable 3-month and 6-month bootcamp workout packages.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A quick review of our perks/rewards will reveal that we are more than willing to give something back to the community that supports us.  As we expand, we will have plenty of room for many new personal trainers including many of our competitors that will be welcome to workout in our new training facility. </span><br/></p>

<p>For donors in Los Angeles, we are offering some great deals on Body Boxing workout packages complete with a satisfaction guarantee.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Banks Won't Give Loans to Small Businesses</strong></p>
<p>Although we have invested a significant amount of our own time and money into our business and have developed a loyal customer base, we have been turned down by numerous banks when seeking a small business loan because we do not have any assets to borrow against.  As many small businesses have done, we have turned our fate over to indiegogo’s crowdfunding platform as it is our only means of expanding our operations and providing a better workout environment and opportunities for our members.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/18750/files/20130818053428-Image_1.jpg?1376829268"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong style=""line-height: 1.45em; text-align: center;"">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: Demand for Personal Trainers will Increase by                                                          31.7%</strong></p>
<p style="""">Based on the research reports included at the bottom of this page, it is crystal clear that the fitness center industry offers a distinctive value-added business proposition. Staying healthy and lean, and looking and feeling one’s best, as well as managing stress and gaining self confidence are values that Americans prize highly.</p>
<p>""Fitness industry jobs are expected to grow for a number of reasons. First, businesses and insurance companies are offering incentives for employees to join health clubs,” said Matt Dotson, an economist for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “Also, as the baby boomers age, they’re encouraged to exercise in order to counteract the effects of aging.”</p>
<p>According to Dotson, personal training and instructor jobs are the occupations driving the majority of increase in the fitness industry and those jobs are expected to grow by 31.7 percent through the year 2020.</p>

<p>For donors who live outside of Los Angeles, we will provide a white paper or DVD on how to get into the fitness business. BBB will train you and provide all the equipment necessary to setup a similar Body Boxing facility in your home town. </p>
<p>In a sense, donors will have access to a very low cost-of-entry to get into the Body Boxing personal fitness business without paying the fees associated with a typical franchise business. Our goal is to teach anyone how to become a personal trainer, while perfecting our business development strategies and marketing rollout programs to ensure that future BBB fitness centers will have a better than average success rate. </p>

First we want to say thank you and welcome to all of our BBB supporters! My name is Kevin Barringer. My business partner, Fernando Ornelas, and I need your help to raise $375,000, to open a our own Functional Training (Think CrossFit) Body Boxing Fitness Center. We need the money to lease, renovate and equip a new kick butt training facility as well as cover the operating/marketing expenses for the first year of operation.
Here are some examples of the workout facility we want to build for Los Angeles:

About BBB!
Body Boxing Bootcamp was created to be something totally original and different from the traditional modes of
fitness workouts or other boot camps!
Body Boxing focuses on sculpting the entire body thru a combination of various types of fitness training such as Boxing/Thai Kick Boxing, Resistance Training (rubber bands and light weight lifting), Plyometrics (jumping and quick movement drills), Calisthenics (using one's own body weight), Obstacle Courses, Circuit Training, Parachute Running, and anything else we can dream up for the day! 
We do this in a very unique way by breaking down each one-hour class into 12-15 min intense workout sections (Warm up & Abs, Strength & Conditioning, Speed & Agility, Boxing/Thai Kick Boxing), which is great for keeping workouts fresh and fun so that clients never get bored and are always challenged. 
Body Boxing Bootcamp services everyone including beginners, advanced fitness enthusiast, overweight kids, baby boomers as well as many celebrities living in Bel Air, Beverly Hills, Park La Brea,  Hollywood, West Hollywood, West Los Angeles, and Mid Wilshire Area of Southern California (CA).



        Donate and Receive Valuable Perks as Well as a Great Return on Your                                                                     Investment!
In return for helping us raise money for our new Fitness Center you will receive cool BBB workout apparel, a number of our patented Bootcamp classes and option to launch your own personal training business using our BBB Fitness Center model and business plan. Not to forget the great feeling you will receive by knowing that you've helped someone achieve a worthwhile goal.
Benefits of Joining Our Body Boxing Bootcamps
Common benefits discovered by beginner Bootcamp students are loss of weight and body fat combined with increased self-confidence after committing to a course. Advanced students find the routines challenging and fun and are always pushed to new heights they never thought possible!

BBB Offers 3 Different Workouts
Body Boxing Bootcamp
Booty Boxing Bootcamp
Boogie Boxing Bootcamp


The BBB Staff has 30 Years of Fitness Experience
Combined we have a total of 30 years of experience working in the physical fitness industry.  We got into the industry not as a career move, but as a lifestyle choice to improve our physical health and well-being.  Being that we were overweight children carrying over into our early adulthood, we turned to fitness training and boxing as a way to lose weight, build confidence and gain control over our physical lives.
In order to help adults as well as children achieve their fitness goals and gain self confidence, we started Body Boxing Bootcamp in 2008 and developed it into a successful business with over 60 customers, 75% of which have been with us from the very start.  We now want to expand our Body Boxing operations and increase our marketing reach by leveraging a physical, mortar-and-brick Bootcamp location. 
 




Building a BBB Fitness Center has many Benefits
A centralized Body Boxing facility will allow our members to take their training to the next level! In addition, our members will have access to locker rooms affording them more time to enjoy the full benefits of a BBB class without having to dash home before going to work! It will provide secure parking lots as well as protection from inclement weather, a current problem of hosting classes in an outdoor environment.
A Body Boxing Bootcamp Workout Center will give us a home base for our operations and boot camp classes. It will also provide our business with a much better marketing opportunity to increase our BBB's brand visibility, and lure customers away from competing fitness centers. Curious customers will now be able to stop by our new fitness center to visit with staff members and/or take a ""free"" trial class before signing up for our more affordable 3-month and 6-month bootcamp workout packages.





What the Community Will Receive
A quick review of our perks/rewards will reveal that we are more than willing to give something back to the community that supports us.  As we expand, we will have plenty of room for many new personal trainers including many of our competitors that will be welcome to workout in our new training facility. 

For donors in Los Angeles, we are offering some great deals on Body Boxing workout packages complete with a satisfaction guarantee.


Banks Won't Give Loans to Small Businesses
Although we have invested a significant amount of our own time and money into our business and have developed a loyal customer base, we have been turned down by numerous banks when seeking a small business loan because we do not have any assets to borrow against.  As many small businesses have done, we have turned our fate over to indiegogo’s crowdfunding platform as it is our only means of expanding our operations and providing a better workout environment and opportunities for our members.


U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: Demand for Personal Trainers will Increase by                                                          31.7%
Based on the research reports included at the bottom of this page, it is crystal clear that the fitness center industry offers a distinctive value-added business proposition. Staying healthy and lean, and looking and feeling one’s best, as well as managing stress and gaining self confidence are values that Americans prize highly.
""Fitness industry jobs are expected to grow for a number of reasons. First, businesses and insurance companies are offering incentives for employees to join health clubs,” said Matt Dotson, an economist for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “Also, as the baby boomers age, they’re encouraged to exercise in order to counteract the effects of aging.”
According to Dotson, personal training and instructor jobs are the occupations driving the majority of increase in the fitness industry and those jobs are expected to grow by 31.7 percent through the year 2020.



BBB Business Plan



For donors who live outside of Los Angeles, we will provide a white paper or DVD on how to get into the fitness business. BBB will train you and provide all the equipment necessary to setup a similar Body Boxing facility in your home town. 
In a sense, donors will have access to a very low cost-of-entry to get into the Body Boxing personal fitness business without paying the fees associated with a typical franchise business. Our goal is to teach anyone how to become a personal trainer, while perfecting our business development strategies and marketing rollout programs to ensure that future BBB fitness centers will have a better than average success rate.

<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Before the ages of steam and internal combustion engines, sailing boats powered by winds of nature ruled the seas. In times when roaring engines and smelly exhaust gasses are no longer welcome, it is time to return to this tradition.</span></p>

<p>Sailing is one of the most exciting and at the same time relaxing activities there is, but somehow it has been taken away from most of us. Mainly because of the high cost of boats and difficulty in mastering sailing itself. With <em>Catri 25</em> this is no longer a problem!</p>
<p>Based on our designer's and team member's Aldis Eglajs <strong>40 years</strong> experience of boat building, we have changed the construction of our yacht so that it can be <strong>used by both - pros</strong>, who crave speed and high performance, <strong>and individuals </strong>looking for some “me time” or a pleasant day with friends or family.</p>
<p>The revolutionary <em>Catri 25</em> will be a serious <strong>alternative to </strong>consider even for <strong>motor boat </strong>enthusiasts - the speed, stability, safety and comfort are almost on par. The best part - you can <strong>travel </strong>for miles <strong>without spending a dime</strong>, making noise, or polluting the water. This is especially important in case of shallow waters, where propellers cause microclimat changes leading to death of fish and other flora and fauna. In the age when environmental protection is the personal responsibility of every individual - <em>Catri 25</em> will be the water craft of choise for all those who care. Even more, with innovative releasing system invented by Aldis Eglajs capsizing on Catri is impossible, and this is most important point of safety! Our <strong>next step</strong> is to develop bigger high speed <em>Catri </em>trimarans to provide even more possibilities for comfortable and safe long distance travels for larger groups.</p>
<h3>How is it done? </h3>
<p><em>Catri 25</em> uses the <strong>hydrofoil technology</strong> with a <strong>patented </strong>twist of our own, that has been developed based on extensive research, mathematical modelling and decades of experience. All patents, issued in this field in the last years, have to do with moving hydrofoil stabilization mechanisms, whereas our patented <em>Catri Foiler </em>solution simply attaches the “feather” at the end of the “arrow”, thus making all kinds of regulating mechanisms irrelevant and achieving <strong>unprecedented stability, safety and speed</strong> of the craft.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://catrigroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/026bowson.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Catri 24""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In our tests we have found the right combination of all the components and created a trimaran that is stable, easy to sail, and has the <strong>potential of being the fastest boat in its class</strong>. <em>Catri 25</em> is a 25 foot long trimaran on underwater wings which have been calculated to be able to lift this birdie <strong>100% above the surface</strong> of water. It`s almost as if you would be flying just above the waterline. </p>
<h3>Why is <em>Catri 25</em> so awesome?</h3>
<ul>
<li>It could be the <strong>fastest </strong>boat in its class </li>
<li>It is extremely <strong>stable &amp; safe  </strong>even at sea and during gusty winds </li>
<li>Easy to operate and steer </li>
<li>Can be folded and <strong>transported conveniently </strong>on a slightly adapted trailer (see the picture below) </li>
<li>It is <strong>spacious </strong>– can easily accommodate a team of 3-4 members for long trips Participate in races or use it for cruises.</li>

<p>In the past 10 months, driven by our passion and trust in our technology, we invested our own resources in manufacturing the main hull, outriggers, beam, wings, mast, and other parts of the craft. We have set up a shipyard and created molds for different boat components in order to make our sea bird available not only for professionals, but also for middle class sailing individuals. Our team has proven their loyalty and devotion for <em>Catri </em>project - their enthusiasm has been one of the main driving forces of this project from day one. </p>
<p>Sadly - the amount of finacial resources necessary for getting this bird into water is out of our reach, since <strong>prototyping and design improvements</strong> always make slight corrections in projects of this type and scale. </p>

Before the ages of steam and internal combustion engines, sailing boats powered by winds of nature ruled the seas. In times when roaring engines and smelly exhaust gasses are no longer welcome, it is time to return to this tradition.

I am hoping to raise enough to get the new pump, but if I don't, the funds will go toward paying my copay for the older pump and supplies. Anything that doesn't go toward getting a pump and supplies will be donated to the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.The ImpactThis pump will prevent me from going into diabetic shock. The sensor alerts the pump when blood sugars fall below 90 and if the alarm isn't responded to, the pump will temporarily suspend insulin delivery until the blood sugar is back to a healthy level. My blood sugars are very difficult to control and the pump will help immensely. Other Ways You Can HelpPlease share this, even if you can't donate. I need this pump and I can't afford it on my own. I'm hoping for the kindness of others to help me. Thank you for taking the time to read this and a huge thanks to anyone who could help or share.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Diabetic foot pain or peripheral neuropathy causes terrible pain for millions of people. You probably know someone who suffers with this excruciating disease. It might be a parent, grandparent, brother, sister or a close friend. Maybe it’s you!</p>
<p>TronaLife Neuropathy Pain Cream can help their pain without any side effects. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 150px;""><img alt=""Dan Lunt picture outdoors"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/894484/pictures/full/20130626092053-DSC_0130.JPG?1372263659"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: text-bottom;""/></p>
<p>Dan Lunt, President/CEO of TronaLife, knows what it’s like to see a loved one suffer with neuropathy. Two sisters and his mother-in-law all deal with this painful condition. Some say it feels like a thousand needles sticking into the soles of their feet. Others compare it to having a blow-torch held to their feet.</p>
<p>So Dan went looking for a solution to help his family members. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><img alt=""Bare foot stepping on broken shards of glass"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/890962/pictures/full/20130624181936-feet_on_glass.jpg?1372148381"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: text-bottom;""/></p>
<h3><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Natural product soothes pain &amp; enhances healing.</strong></h3>
<p>While looking for an answer, Dan met a chemist, Pete Fuller, who had done a lot of work for NASA and had developed a unique (patent pending) formula consisting of natural herb and mineral elements that enhances sub-cutaneous circulation when applied to the skin.</p>
<p>The potential applications were exciting!</p>
<p>Together with Pete and another chemist who specializes in homeopathic formulations, Dan was able to produce a soothing and healing lotion that not only relieves pain but enhances healing by improving blood circulation in the area of application.</p>
<p>Subsequently, hundreds of testers have reported significant relief from their peripheral neuropathy pain with the added benefit of healthier skin and no reported side effects. TronaLife Neuropathy Relief Cream worked like a miracle and Dan's family members finally had the relief they had been praying for.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/894663/pictures/full/20130626103248-Trona-Product-Shot_M.png?1372267971"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: text-bottom;""/></p>
<h3><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">TronaLife NRC relieves the pain with no side effects.</strong></h3>
<p>Dan has produced several relatively small batches of TronaLife NRC for testing purposes and for friends and family who were desperate for some relief. Through word-of-mouth, demand for TronaLife has been growing. People with PN from causes other than diabetes reasoned that if it worked for diabetic PN, why not for PN from chemo-therapy, or from surgeries? As more people tried it, the potential for relief continued to grow. It has been very gratifying to see people who have suffered for years, suddenly find relief. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Read what is being said about TronaLife NRC:</strong></p>
<p><em>I have been evaluating the efficacy of TronaLife’s formula in my clinic over the past 18 months, and have found it to be effective for promoting the healing of wounds and reducing the discomfort of peripheral neuropathy. TronaLife’s base formula includes natural mineral and homeopathic ingredients proven to reduce pain and inflammation while gently promoting dilation of the small blood vessels, improving circulation and enhancing the delivery of nutrients to and the elimination of waste from cells. The results have been remarkable and include enhanced healing, less pain and better health. </em>-<em>Sherman B. Johnson, MD., Advanced Wound Care and Hyperbaric Healing Systems, Taylorsville, UT</em></p>
<p><em>Before trying the TronaLife neuropathy relief cream, my feet and legs would swell so bad by mid-afternoon, I’d have to elevate my legs. Just to touch them would hurt. Since I’ve been using TronaLife, the swelling in my feet and legs is gone and I’m able to touch my legs without pain. - Vera, Sandy, UT</em></p>
<p><em>I have neuropathy in my feet as a result of diabetes. The pain is with me constantly and makes it uncomfortable to walk or even wear shoes, but the worst pain comes at night when I try to go to sleep. Sometimes the burning sensation is so severe that even though I know it can’t be so, I find myself lifting the sheets to look at my feet simply to reassure myself that they are not literally on fire. Since I started using the TronaLife Cream, my pain has virtually gone away. It is so nice to get a good night’s sleep again! </em><em>- Doug L, Sandy, UT</em></p>
<p><em>I am a diabetic with peripheral neuropathy in my feet and hands. Some days my feet and hands are so numb I can barely walk or even pick up objects. I started to use TronaLife Neuropathy Relief Cream on my feet. As I put the cream on my feet, I would use my hands to do so. As a result, not only has the numbness in my feet gone away, but also the numbness in my hands. I can now walk much better and I am able to pick up small items that use to be hard to even hold. </em><em>- Arolyn V. Salt Lake City, UT</em></p>
<p><em>FINALLY SOME ACTUAL RELIEF!!! Just sent through my 2nd order after experiencing some relief after 7 YEARS of CONSTANT PAIN (blow torch burning, exacto knife sharp pain &amp; electric shocks from nerves)…..the 1st and ONLY product to ACTUALLY DO WHAT WAS PROMISED!!! I WILL be discussing Tronalife with my Primary MD &amp; my Endocronologist at my next visits in March!! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!! </em><em>- Donna Wanke, West Bend, WI </em></p>
<p><em>I have diabetes and experienced tingling along with a genetic foot condition of muscle tightness in my heels which causes extreme pain when walking. Wearing any shoe for more than a few hours and then constantly having to massage my feet during the day to even be able to walk to my car was my normal, until being introduced to TronaLife Neuropathy Cream. I can confidently walk in any shoe without pain and have been able to continue my goal of running a half marathon with my husband! Thanks TronaLife. </em><em>- Breanne J.

<strong> </strong><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Everyone wants TronaLife Neuropathy Relief Cream.</strong>

<p>It is estimated that over 19 million people in the U.S. suffer from peripheral neuropathy. The largest percentage is caused by diabetes - a disease that is growing at an alarming rate. The big picture is one of suffering at a monumental level.</p>
<p>How can you calculate the cost of so many people in pain and unable to function at full capacity?</p>
<p>Knowing how much it can help, Dan has worked hard to produce more product and get the word out. ""It is wonderful,"" he says, ""to be able to help people who suffer from the excruciating pain of diabetic nerve pain,"" but he would like to do more.  </p>
<h3><strong>Without your help, we can’t produce enough to help everyone.</strong></h3>

<p>To produce TronaLife Neuropathy Relief Cream at a price that is affordable for people, we need to manufacture the cream in larger lots. Everything about the product including bottles, labels, caps and contents becomes less expensive in higher quantities. But this is an expense that is incurred on the front end.</p>
<p>On the other hand, with sufficient inventory, not only can we meet existing demand but we can also promote TronaLife with confidence to many more people who need the relief but are unaware that this product exists.</p>
<p>""If we have enough money, we can stop the suffering for literally tens of thousands of suffering people.”</p>

<p>And, of course, if we can raise even more, we can help even more.</p>
<h3><strong>What Your Donations will Be Used For?</strong></h3>
<p>It is expensive to manufacture and market enough TronaLife NRC to help thousands of sufferers. Here is what we will do with your support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product manufacturing, including:
<ul>
<li>Updated bottles and labels</li>
<li>Packaging for retail applications</li>
<li>Sufficient quantities to keep prices low and meet demand</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Marketing - we have to get the word out</li>
</ul><p>Additionally, not only during this campaign but on an ongoing basis, we will donate a generous portion of our revenues to diabetes research.</p>
<h3>Diabetes: Getting to the Root of the Problem.</h3>

Diabetic foot pain or peripheral neuropathy causes terrible pain for millions of people. You probably know someone who suffers with this excruciating disease. It might be a parent, grandparent, brother, sister or a close friend. Maybe it’s you!
TronaLife Neuropathy Pain Cream can help their pain without any side effects. 

Dan Lunt, President/CEO of TronaLife, knows what it’s like to see a loved one suffer with neuropathy. Two sisters and his mother-in-law all deal with this painful condition. Some say it feels like a thousand needles sticking into the soles of their feet. Others compare it to having a blow-torch held to their feet.
So Dan went looking for a solution to help his family members. 

Natural product soothes pain & enhances healing.
While looking for an answer, Dan met a chemist, Pete Fuller, who had done a lot of work for NASA and had developed a unique (patent pending) formula consisting of natural herb and mineral elements that enhances sub-cutaneous circulation when applied to the skin.
The potential applications were exciting!
Together with Pete and another chemist who specializes in homeopathic formulations, Dan was able to produce a soothing and healing lotion that not only relieves pain but enhances healing by improving blood circulation in the area of application.
Subsequently, hundreds of testers have reported significant relief from their peripheral neuropathy pain with the added benefit of healthier skin and no reported side effects. TronaLife Neuropathy Relief Cream worked like a miracle and Dan's family members finally had the relief they had been praying for.

TronaLife NRC relieves the pain with no side effects.
Dan has produced several relatively small batches of TronaLife NRC for testing purposes and for friends and family who were desperate for some relief. Through word-of-mouth, demand for TronaLife has been growing. People with PN from causes other than diabetes reasoned that if it worked for diabetic PN, why not for PN from chemo-therapy, or from surgeries? As more people tried it, the potential for relief continued to grow. It has been very gratifying to see people who have suffered for years, suddenly find relief. 
 
Read what is being said about TronaLife NRC:
I have been evaluating the efficacy of TronaLife’s formula in my clinic over the past 18 months, and have found it to be effective for promoting the healing of wounds and reducing the discomfort of peripheral neuropathy. TronaLife’s base formula includes natural mineral and homeopathic ingredients proven to reduce pain and inflammation while gently promoting dilation of the small blood vessels, improving circulation and enhancing the delivery of nutrients to and the elimination of waste from cells. The results have been remarkable and include enhanced healing, less pain and better health. -Sherman B. Johnson, MD., Advanced Wound Care and Hyperbaric Healing Systems, Taylorsville, UT
Before trying the TronaLife neuropathy relief cream, my feet and legs would swell so bad by mid-afternoon, I’d have to elevate my legs. Just to touch them would hurt. Since I’ve been using TronaLife, the swelling in my feet and legs is gone and I’m able to touch my legs without pain. - Vera, Sandy, UT
I have neuropathy in my feet as a result of diabetes. The pain is with me constantly and makes it uncomfortable to walk or even wear shoes, but the worst pain comes at night when I try to go to sleep. Sometimes the burning sensation is so severe that even though I know it can’t be so, I find myself lifting the sheets to look at my feet simply to reassure myself that they are not literally on fire. Since I started using the TronaLife Cream, my pain has virtually gone away. It is so nice to get a good night’s sleep again! - Doug L, Sandy, UT
I am a diabetic with peripheral neuropathy in my feet and hands. Some days my feet and hands are so numb I can barely walk or even pick up objects. I started to use TronaLife Neuropathy Relief Cream on my feet. As I put the cream on my feet, I would use my hands to do so. As a result, not only has the numbness in my feet gone away, but also the numbness in my hands. I can now walk much better and I am able to pick up small items that use to be hard to even hold. - Arolyn V. Salt Lake City, UT
FINALLY SOME ACTUAL RELIEF!!! Just sent through my 2nd order after experiencing some relief after 7 YEARS of CONSTANT PAIN (blow torch burning, exacto knife sharp pain & electric shocks from nerves)…..the 1st and ONLY product to ACTUALLY DO WHAT WAS PROMISED!!! I WILL be discussing Tronalife with my Primary MD & my Endocronologist at my next visits in March!! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!! - Donna Wanke, West Bend, WI 
I have diabetes and experienced tingling along with a genetic foot condition of muscle tightness in my heels which causes extreme pain when walking. Wearing any shoe for more than a few hours and then constantly having to massage my feet during the day to even be able to walk to my car was my normal, until being introduced to TronaLife Neuropathy Cream. I can confidently walk in any shoe without pain and have been able to continue my goal of running a half marathon with my husband! Thanks TronaLife. - Breanne J. Salt Lake City, UT 


 Everyone wants TronaLife Neuropathy Relief Cream.

It is estimated that over 19 million people in the U.S. suffer from peripheral neuropathy. The largest percentage is caused by diabetes - a disease that is growing at an alarming rate. The big picture is one of suffering at a monumental level.
How can you calculate the cost of so many people in pain and unable to function at full capacity?
Knowing how much it can help, Dan has worked hard to produce more product and get the word out. ""It is wonderful,"" he says, ""to be able to help people who suffer from the excruciating pain of diabetic nerve pain,"" but he would like to do more.  
Without your help, we can’t produce enough to help everyone.
 
To produce TronaLife Neuropathy Relief Cream at a price that is affordable for people, we need to manufacture the cream in larger lots. Everything about the product including bottles, labels, caps and contents becomes less expensive in higher quantities. But this is an expense that is incurred on the front end.
On the other hand, with sufficient inventory, not only can we meet existing demand but we can also promote TronaLife with confidence to many more people who need the relief but are unaware that this product exists.
""If we have enough money, we can stop the suffering for literally tens of thousands of suffering people.”
 
Help us to relieve the pain for thousands who suffer from peripheral neuropathy. TronaLife's Neuropathy Relief Cream provides relief without awful side effects!
 
$20,000 can reduce the suffering of thousands of good people.
We need $20,000 to manufacture enough TronaLife Neuropathy Relief Cream to fill the orders, get the word out to more people and help those family members and friends we love get relief from their constant pain.
And, of course, if we can raise even more, we can help even more.
What Your Donations will Be Used For?
It is expensive to manufacture and market enough TronaLife NRC to help thousands of sufferers. Here is what we will do with your support:

Product manufacturing, including:

Updated bottles and labels
Packaging for retail applications
Sufficient quantities to keep prices low and meet demand


Marketing - we have to get the word out
Additionally, not only during this campaign but on an ongoing basis, we will donate a generous portion of our revenues to diabetes research.
Diabetes: Getting to the Root of the Problem.
While peripheral neuropathy can have many causes, the leading cause is diabetes. As long as diabetes remains a growing problem, the problem with peripheral neuropathy will grow as well. 
""Frankly,"" Dan says, ""a growing problem might be good for our business but it is a horrible drain on society and on the individuals who suffer. Our hope is that someday soon, a cure for diabetes can be found that will eliminate a major part of this problem.""
""With that in mind, we are donating a generous amount from each sale of our product to the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation to be used to help find a cure.""

Over the last year we have begun work and have turned an overgrown area into a welcoming environment and have almost completed construction of our stables. However, more work is needed. We have started our arena and as spring is approaching we need to have it completed soon. With your help, we hope to welcome our first members around Easter.

We are in the process of acquiring used telephone poles to bank up the arena to level the surface. The telephone poles will also be used to support the roof. We will also be needing various grades of gravel (ranging from large stones to fine gravel) for the various layers of the arena.</p><p>Also the area will be fenced off to stop any accidental straying (whether of the two or four footed kind!) into the arena during a session. Again, recycled materials (crossbeams) will be used.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Although recycled items are more cost effective, the sheer amount that we will need raises our costs.

Over the last year we have begun work and have turned an overgrown area into a welcoming environment and have almost completed construction of our stables. However, more work is needed. We have started our arena and as spring is approaching we need to have it completed soon. With your help, we hope to welcome our first members around Easter. The arena is our utmost priority at this time as this is where the children and adults will be able to interact with their pony or horse. We need your helpWe need help to finish our arena and get it covered to enable year round activities, whether it is riding or even playing games or doing sports. As we are trying to keep our carbon footprint as low as possible, recycled and natural materials will be used wherever possible. We are in the process of acquiring used telephone poles to bank up the arena to level the surface. The telephone poles will also be used to support the roof. We will also be needing various grades of gravel (ranging from large stones to fine gravel) for the various layers of the arena.Also the area will be fenced off to stop any accidental straying (whether of the two or four footed kind!) into the arena during a session. Again, recycled materials (crossbeams) will be used.Although recycled items are more cost effective, the sheer amount that we will need raises our costs. Estimates that we have are:Telephone poles (15 tonnes x 56 euros a tonne) 840 eurosCrossbeams (4 tonnes x 100 euros a tonne) 400 eurosTransport for the above: (200 x 2) 400 eurosGravel: 1000 eurosTransport: 500 eurosRoof and roofing materials, lighting: 2700 eurosHeavy equipment (JCB) (2 days x 300) 600 eurosWork:  300 euros (the majority of the work will be of no charge)Misc costs 460 euros.A small token of our appreciationAs we are not producing a product that is transferrable, all our supporters will receive at least a thank you email or letter and apart from the humble perks we offer, all supporters (if they so wish) will have their names on a page on our website that is dedicated to our supporters. (Our webpage is under construction and link will be uploaded once complete).However, if you are in Greece or plan on visiting Greece you are very welcome to come visit us and see our work as we are very close to Patras.Some information about Patras and surrounding areas if you decide to visit:  Patras is Greece's third largest urban area and the regional capital of
Western Greece, in northern Peloponnese, 215 km west of Athens. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patras
Patras is a key tourist region,
being situated at reasonable distances between these famous archeological sites of
Greece:
Olympia, a sanctuary of ancient Greece where the Olympic Games were initiated http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia,_Greece
Delphi, the site of the Delphic oracle, the
most important oracle in the classical Greek world, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi
Nafplio, the capital of the First Hellenic
Republic, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NafplioIf our goal is not reached, whatever funding is achieved will still go towards the arena but work will have to stop once funds run out.Your Impact - financial or otherwiseDuring this period of severe crisis in Greece which has affected many people, young and old, (depression has risen acutely amongst people, predominately young), with your help we will be able to give the opportunity to children from all walks of life to come into contact with horses and their therapeutic ability. We also welcome any child or adult who is interested in being with and learning about horses and riding.Children with special needs in particular will be able to benefit from contact with the horse and if they are able to ride, from the movement of the horse. With our non-profit organization and club we will be able to subsidise sessions for families or individuals in a low income bracket.Even if you can't help financially, we would appreciate if you could help spread the word about our campaign!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

It naturally augments your ability to think and interact with reality. Holding the device in your hand can clarify your goals, uncover new solutions to old problems, brainstorm new ideas, manage stress better, augment meditation and prayer, and much more, all within your own level of expertise.Tarc is an advanced device that connects your DNA to the universe and creates a field of electromagnetic energy within which you can improve yourself. And because it contains no battery, you can use it anytime you want and for as long as you want. There's no terrestrial network and no connection fee, you are free to use Tarc anywhere.(And no agency can spy on you, which is a bonus.)Improve the way you think and interact with the world with the science of Tarc.This is where magic and science finally come together. Rather than invent another fancy computing device to measure the rate of growth of your fingernails, I decided to invent a device that would replace the computer. It was ambitious. But I am a fan of ambition.The Age of the Transistor is over. It's time to move on.The next-gen TarcThis futuristic computing device is the first of its kind. It modulates and magnifies thought waves to connect you to the universe (reality, nature, god). Tarc is based on a transistor-free architecture, it emits no harmful electromagnetic waves and is powered by the energy in your body.Tarc augments your mental abilities and your access to ideas and information. Meditation, brainstorming, solving problems, thinking through solutions, creative projects, prayer, introspection, soul searching, healing, magical thinking... anything that involves thinking this device can help.Transistor-free computing
Today we all use tablet PCs and smartphones. But these are built with millions of transistors. They require batteries, emit harmful electromagnetic radiation, and come with monthly fees. Imagine a mobile computing device that has no transistors, no battery and no monthly fees. Meet the next-gen Tarc. In development now for 6 years, and proven to work in the hands of others, this device connects you to reality. The reality field is made up of endless information. By accessing the library of reality,
you gain access to new ideas, new solutions, perhaps even revelations, and you
gain insight into things, including things having to do with yourself and your
goals in life. Solving problems.
Call it Reality Surfing.If Tarc is the computer. Then you are the software.
Where I’m
going
The first-generation Tarc was launched last year. I’d like to
take the Tarc device to the next level and make available an advanced scientific device
unlike ever before.
This is year
6 for me and I’m pleased with Tarc. It works. While the computing device amplifies and
modulates thought waves, what it’s been doing is providing users access to the available information in the universal fields of energy. Yes, whenever you think you are tapping into different fields of energy. Whether you are trying to figure out what to do with your life or whether you are finishing your next art masterpiece, thinking and reality fields are always involved.I want to develop a device that is comparable is quality to modern technological devices, except without the technology because let's face it, they can only put so many transistors on the head of a pin.
Transistor-free computing
A
transistor-free device with no electronics or battery. The device has a copper casing and is powered by
the energy in your body. Its secret crystalline architecture amplifies and redirects
thought energy. And you are the software.Electromagnetic
fields surround the human body. Using the available bioelectricity in your
body, Tarc device allows you to become an observer-participant to reality
(universe).
I need funds
to take the device to the next level.
Additional funds would go to design, production, and (possibly) packaging and marketing materials.I want to
focus my energy on an improved design, a better architecture and
materials. I demonstrated that I could vastly improve on the original design, a small pod (see image above) with a small amount of funding. I’m happy to build a small batch of powerful

<p> </p>
<p>On August 3rd 2010 i weighed 327 lbs. On that day I started my work out routine, but really my journey started a long time ago.</p>
<p>14 years ago I lost my son. I lost him to the complexity of divorde and the unfortunate hurt feelings that happened as a result. I didn't want to be an embarrassment, so it was easier for me to stay away from him. I thought since my weight was embarrassing to me so it must be embarrassing to him as well. What i didn't know was that the more I stayed away from him the bigger i got. Distancing myself from him was the cause of my depression. To ease my aching heart I ate. The more I ate, the bigger i got, the more depressed i became. To quote a famous movie, ""It's a Vicious Circle"". I was in a downward spiral. There was only one place for me to go, Rock Bottom. In reality i was trying to kill myself with out actually doing it. I was literally eating myself to an early grave.</p>
<p>A miracle brought me back from the brink of self-destruction. I call it a miracle, most other people call it Facebook. Over 2 years ago i reconnected with my son through Facebook and wouldn't you know it... he didn't care how big i was. Try this on for size, HE WANTED TO SEE ME! Here was the little boy i had left behind almost 13 years earlier and he wanted to see me and know me. Now he was a grown man, and a damn fine man too.</p>
<p>I wanted to be the kind of man my son could be proud of. I knew i needed to change. On August 3rd 2010, I walked in to the gym for the first time. I weighed 327 lbs, I had a goal to get below 200 lbs and i knew it was going to be a long hard road. I wanted to do it the old fashioned way, diet and exercise. At this time i didn't know if i was going to be able to do it. But I had to try.</p>
<p>I started with my diet. I cut out all the soda and reduced my food intake. I didn't stop eating what I wanted, I just ate less of it. I started slow with my exercise regimen. It was 10 minutes on an elliptical machine, 5 days a week. I knew you couldn't take a fat guy and just throw him on the track and get him running.</p>
<p>The day came to meet the man that my son had become. I flew out to see him the the weekend of August 27th, 2011. I had already taken my first tentative steps on my journey. That weekend with my son inspired me to get to the finish line. He is a man, a better man than i ever was and one that i hope to be one day.</p>
<p>When i got home I went back to the gym. The more I went to the gym the more confident I became. I began increasing 5 minutes every week. I was also increasing the level on the elliptical every couple of weeks. In April of 2011 I noticed that i had reached a plateau; I needed to change what i was doing. Keep in mind, by tis time, I was working out on the elliptical for an hour; but I needed to change my routine. So, I started using a stair master. It took me an hour to find a level that wouldn't kill me but would give me a solid workout. That was level 7, which was about 4 miles of stairs.</p>
<p>I also knew that i needed to greatly reduce my caloric intake. I was working 40 or more hours a week and working out 5 or 6 days a week. I didn't have time to prepare meals for my lunch at work. I decided to go with a pre-made meal. I tried every low calorie TV dinner i could find. Healthy choice, Smart ones and Lean Cuisine to name a few. Ultimately i went with Lean cuisine. It was the only one i could find that was tasty. I knew that these pre made meals weren't the best way to go. I knew i was putting in alot of sodium. but the one thing i did know it was going to be the easiest way to track my calorie intake.</p>
<p>By this time i was eating 1200 - 1500 calories a day and going to gym 5-6 days a week. Everyday at the gym I was burning 3000 - 4000 calories a day. The pounds started melting off.</p>
<p>I was seeing progress on the scale every week, that was all the motivation I needed. But it was also amazing getting comments from coworkers and friends. I wanted to prove to myself and everyone out there, that i could do something amazing on my own. I didn't need surgery or a crazy diet. I followed one simple rule: burn more calories than you take in. Being an inspiration to peope helped as well, I didn't want to let them down. People were (and still are) always coming up to me and saying that i inspired them to go for a walk or go to the gym. I honestly never thought I had that in me.</p>
<p>On the morning of Novemer 24th 2011 I weighed in at 199 lbs. I had reached my goal!</p>
<h2>             A Half Marathon? Are You kidding?</h2>
<p>The first week of December 2010 I jokingly told a coworker that if i got to my goal weight by December 3rd 2011, I would run the Las Vegas half marathon on December 4th 2011. The more weight I lost the more possible it seemed, so i really started taking it seriously. In August 2011 i started running, and then i fell in love with running. I got an email about 2 months before the half marathon was to take place telling me that there was only 500 spots open and they where going to sell out. I had to make a decision, I was still 25 lbs away from my goal weight and I was on the plateau from hell. My weight wasn't going anywhere. I said ""screw it I am going to register for the half marathon,"" and wouldn't you know it, the weight started melting off of me again. I reached my goal weight on Thanksgiving morning. I was mentally and physically ready for the next adventure of my life.</p>
<p>On December 4th 2011 I ran the Las Vegas half marathon in 2 hours and 36 minutes. I replay the moment I crossed the finish line in my head over and over again. I was so emotional, I just couldn't believe that i went from 327 lbs to running a half marathon in 15 months. I didn't care how bad my muscles or my feet hurt, it felt like I was walking on a cloud.</p>
<p>It took a long time, but I finally recovered from my first half marathon. It was getting close to the New Year, and everyone was coming up with their resolutions for 2012. I thought losing 128 lbs in 2011 was amazing, so i had to come up with something bigger. I needed something that would, hopefully, motivate and inspire everyone. I needed something that would keep me motivated for the next year. I wouldn't have the scale giving me motivation anymore, because now I was in the maintaining phase. I knew that I wanted to run more half marathons. I had become addicted, it wasn't the running part by itself that was addicting. It was the fact that i did it with so many people. So I came up with 12 half marathons in 2012, it sounded catch and i made it my goal for 2012.</p>
<p>I am 9 races into my goal, and i would have thought that my body would have gave up on me by now, and that would be the reason why i wouldn't be able to reach my goal. But in reality it has put such a financial strain on me that i have ran out of money. I am so close to reaching my goal that I can taste it. I only have 3 races to go.</p>
<p>So in short, that is why i came to this site. To ask you all for some help. Two out of the three races i have left i need to travel too. The 12th and final race of this year is in Las Vegas, my home town. so i don't need to travel to that race. but the entry fee is really steep.</p>
<p>I want to thank you all for taking the time to read this, and i hope you feel inspired enough to get out there and excercise, and donate so i can get out there and finish this goal.</p>

Notre mission: Prévenir la maladie et célébrer la santé de tous.Pour bien résumer l'initiative en question:
Un tour de vélo de 1200km en 5 jours autour du Nouveau-Brunswick (Bouctouche - Fredericton - Edmundston - Campbellton - Caraquet - Bouctouche)
Un groupe de près de 100 cyclistes formé de participants âgés de 12 ans à 65 ans (élèves, enseignants, membres des communautés...) Une initiative sans précédant au Canada!
Les fonds amassés contribuent directement à venir en aide à des familles défavorisées pour leur permettre d'offrir aux jeunes l'occasion de pratiquer des activités sportives et vivre une vie saine et active sans contraintes financières.
Notre objectif, nos motivations et l'impact de votre contribution
L'objectif de cette levée de fonds est de récolter 1$ pour chacun des 1200 kilomètres qui seront parcourus lors du Grand Défi. Puisque la présente campagne se déroule sur une période d'un mois, cela signifie une moyenne de 40$ de dons par jour, ce qui s'avère très réaliste!                                    

Les données d'une étude publiée dans la revue de l'Association médicale canadienne sont alarmantes. L'obésité a triplé au Canada entre 1985 et 2011 et les taux les plus sérieux (l'obésité de type 2 et 3) sont les plus élevés au Nouveau-Brunswick en comparaison aux autres provinces canadiennes. L'étude révèle que d'ici 5 ans, un Canadien sur cinq sera obèse. On rapporte que le Nouveau-Brunswick possèderait le plus haut taux d'obésité morbide au pays et que si la tendance se maintient, le nombre de personnes obèses dans la province pourrait continué d'augmenter au cours des 5 prochaines années, si bien que par 2019, entre 25 à 30% des Néo-Brunswickois seront obèses!
Voici une occasion pour vous de faire une différence! Suite à la campagne, les dons que vous aurez effectués seront distribués à l'ensemble des intitutions scolaires participantes pour donner une chance égale à tous les enfants de pouvoir cultiver le plaisir de bouger et ainsi vivre une vie saine et active! Ceci contribuera à améliorer le sort des communautés du Nouveau-Brunswick sur la question de l'obésité et des mauvaises habitudes de vie. De plus, en effectuant un don minimum de 25$, 50$ ou 100$, vous aurez l'option de demander d'obtenir une récompense en souvenir de votre geste:
25$ : Autocollant des Héros du coeur
50$ : Photo souvenir des cyclistes de l'édition de cette année, ainsi qu'un aimant à frigo portant le logo officiel des Héros du coeur.
100$ : T-shirt des Héros du coeur que vous pourrez porter fièrement

<h3>Hi all,</h3>
<p>My name is Paula Knight and I am a 41 year old married mother of two  adult daughters and I live  in the beautiful town of Toowoomba in South East Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>I am currently half way through my university degree of a Bachelor of Science and loving every minute of it as it has been a life long dream. Approximately 12 months ago I suffered with a bout of Myocarditis (an infection in the heart muscle) which left me ill for quite some time. Having recovered from this, I was left with chronic tiredness and other symptoms to the point I thought I may have to give up university for good.</p>
<p>After more tests failed to indicate what was happening to me, my doctor suggested that I may be suffering from Sleep Apnea (pauses in breathing during sleep) and sent me off for testing. The results were yes, I had severe sleep apnea. I have been placed on a rental CPAP(continuous positive airway pressure) machine on a two month trial. Which at the end of the trial you must purchase your own machine at the cost of  $2500. </p>
<p>I have had the rental CPAP machine for two weeks and I feel amazing already. It is like waking up out of a fog. I have better memory recall, my high blood pressure is better and my chronic tiredness is all but gone. I am symptom free. It really has been miraculous.</p>
<p>Being a university student and having a husband with a permanent disability finances have been tight, as most people can relate to these days. What it boils down to is  that I simply cannot afford to purchase this CPAP machine myself at the end of the two month trial but also cannot do with out it to be able to function everyday and continue at university. It really is a terrible predicament to be in.</p>
<p>I am asking for help because I have run out of options, this is my last ditch effort to be able to remain at university, finish my degree and then gain employment to support my family as we are a single income family.</p>
<p>Any assistance you can offer to me and my family would be most appreciated.</p>
<p>I thank you in advance.</p>

<p><strong>Please help
support our online fundraiser for my amazing friend Shawn Miyahara’s cancer
treatments and travel expenses as she fights a rare form of Non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma. Any and all donations will be very much appreciated.</strong> </p>
<p>Shawn is 27
and was diagnosed with a very rare form of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in July. Her
treatments are not fully covered by her insurance and her form of cancer
requires travel to MD Anderson in Houston (about 8 hour drive). All donations
will go directly to Shawn for her ever rising medical bills and/or travel
expenses. I have volunteers that are going to shave their heads for each $250
we raise up to $1000 hence the name Shave4Shawn.<span>  </span></p>
<p>My husband
and I met Shawn when she was a personal trainer at our gym in addition to her
day job. She encouraged and inspired so many people through her sweet and
thoughtful nature. She always went above and beyond to help people reach their
personal goals, including myself (which is why I am more than willing to shave
my head for her). Shawn and her husband Michael are also very active within
their church in Owasso (lifechurch.tv). Michael plays in the band every Sunday,
and Shawn volunteers her time to help out whenever needed. </p>
<p>Over the last couple years we have become very
good friends with Shawn and Michael. They have been there for us through hard
times and we would love to return the favor. We want Shawn to get any and all
treatments she requires to heal and stay the vibrant, active young woman we all
know and love. We are asking for your help in reaching this goal. We currently
have no idea what the figure is that she will end up needing, but her new chemo
will cost about $30,000 per treatment and she will be needing anywhere from 4
to 6 treatments. Right now her insurance is not covering it. Thank you for
taking the time to read about our campaign and THANK YOU to everyone who
donates. Every little bit helps and may God bless you for your support. Even if
you can’t make a monetary donation please tell everyone about our campaign! Pray
for her, share on Facebook, word of mouth, or any other way to let everyone know
about this wonderful, young woman who deserves to have so much more time with
us. </p>

campaign run by the organization Shalva (<a href=""http://www.run4shalva.org/en/index.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.run4shalva.org/en/index.php</a>), which focuses on aiding

has over 500 participants with special needs ranging from infants to young

many years I’ve been part of the Porsche Club of America’s amateur racing
series in a 944. I’ve had several
successful seasons, including the 2014 season were I took second place in the
national 944 Cup championship.  I’m ready
to build on these successes and transition into pro racing.  I have my sights set on the Pirelli World Challenge,
a televised series that focuses on late-model production cars.</p>
<p>I want to build a team, that you are part of, to bring amateur racing to the big leagues.  With your help I can successfully campaign a car and show the motorsports world what a team effort can accomplish.</p>
<p>Pirelli World Challenge runs races across the United States with two primary classes: GT for current-production sports cars; and TC for smaller current-production cars.</p>
<p>My focus is on the six-races featuring the TC class, which includes hatchbacks, sedans and smaller sports cars.  The operating expense of the smaller cars are less, and the six TC races will require less travel commitment than the eleven-race GT schedule.<br/></p>
<p>My usual racing budget won't cover everything - just about half.  That's why I'm launching this campaign!  With your contribution and my contribution, we can actually go pro racing.</p>

</h3> <p>Luckily, I do not need money for entry fees - that was my 944 Cup Championship prize!  But, to utilize those free entries, there is a whole lot more that I do need.</p>
<p>Although I need an eligible car, the largest expense by far is actually the transportation.  The car needs to be transported/trailered to races across the country, and the driver (me) and crew (possibly you?) also need to travel and spend several nights on the road for each race.  The smallest segment is for the consumables - the tires, brakes, gas, oil, spare parts, etc.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of what I think is needed for a season in the TCB class:</p>

<h3>My goals<br/>
</h3>
<p>In addition to winning races and becoming a Pirelli World Challenge
champion, I want to provide a way for <b>you</b>, my sponsors, to be involved and
participate in world-class racing.  That
participation might just be knowing your support helped make it happen; that
participation might be watching <b>your </b>team kick some ass on TV or YouTube;
that participation might be attending a race in person and providing crew
support!  </p>
<p>This is an excellent way to get your name or brand on TV and in front of a national audience.  It's like owning an NFL team, just a little smaller (and cheaper!)  For large sponsors, the car can become a moving billboard that will be seen around the world.  Contact me for the <i>grande enchilada</i> package, which includes driver interviews
and displaying the car at your business between race weekends for more promotion.</p>If my fundraising goal isn't met, it doesn't mean that everything is off the table - it just means I'll have to scale down the endeavor.  Perhaps only do a few races on the schedule or rent-a-ride.</div>
<div> <h3>My Track Record<br/>
</h3> <p>Let me tell you a little more about myself.  After buying my first 944 in 1996 and autocrossing for a year, I decided to try a HPDE (high performance driver's ed) at a race track.  I was hooked right away and spent every available weekend at the track progressing through the ranks.  A look at some of my achievements:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>2002 - rookie race at Lime Rock in a 944 Turbo S</li>
<li>2005-2014 - Chief Driving Instructor for the Hudson Champlain PCA region</li>
<li>In the last 10 years - 74 race starts, 45 podium finishes, 18 class wins</li>

<h3>What is Team Hack Racing?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Team ""Hack Racing"" started out as a light-hearted moniker for some of my Porsche friends and I to poke fun at our limited resources.  The team spirit is exemplified in the logo - a blow torch and hacksaw - which represents our resolve to use whatever tools are necessary to get the job done and get on track.  But it has real meaning as I contemplate joining a pro series - I will be a little fish among the ""big dogs"" in terms of resources.  However, make no mistake, I'm not short on ingenuity, drive or talent - I'm ready to take them by storm in proper Hack Racing fashion!</p>

many years I’ve been part of the Porsche Club of America’s amateur racing
series in a 944. I’ve had several
successful seasons, including the 2014 season were I took second place in the
national 944 Cup championship.  I’m ready
to build on these successes and transition into pro racing.  I have my sights set on the Pirelli World Challenge,
a televised series that focuses on late-model production cars.
I want to build a team, that you are part of, to bring amateur racing to the big leagues.  With your help I can successfully campaign a car and show the motorsports world what a team effort can accomplish.
Pirelli World Challenge runs races across the United States with two primary classes: GT for current-production sports cars; and TC for smaller current-production cars.
My focus is on the six-races featuring the TC class, which includes hatchbacks, sedans and smaller sports cars.  The operating expense of the smaller cars are less, and the six TC races will require less travel commitment than the eleven-race GT schedule.
My usual racing budget won't cover everything - just about half.  That's why I'm launching this campaign!  With your contribution and my contribution, we can actually go pro racing.
Off to a good start!
In the first 24 hours of the campaign, support has be tremendous!  Here's a big Thank You to those people:

The first round of rewards have been made and sent out to all current contributors!  Do you want a Hack Racing decal, too?  Make a contribution today!

And here's how I make the Hack Racing magnets!

Tee-shirts will be on the way soon!  Make a contribution by 12/10/14 to receive it by Christmas!  They make an excellent gift.  (In case you can't figure out the puzzle, it's ""Racing with heart"" - the nice way to give it all you've got!)

The fact that all I need to do is stop eating animals and I will gain abundant health, help heal the planet and save the lives of between 80 and 400 animals every year... It is an opportunity I simply cannot refuse. The result? Peace of mind and an ever-lasting feeling of Elation. </p><p>That is how I want you to feel: Elated!</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Be An Elated Supporter</h3><p>Do you believe in the work Elated does, but don't have the cash to spare?

So discovering that 'Enhancing the Lives of Animals Through Ethical Decisions’ produces the acronym ‘ELATED’ was a gift from the land of impossible-dreams-come-true!For me, living a vegan lifestyle resonates with my core inner truth. The fact that all I need to do is stop eating animals and I will gain abundant health, help heal the planet and save the lives of between 80 and 400 animals every year... It is an opportunity I simply cannot refuse. The result? Peace of mind and an ever-lasting feeling of Elation. That is how I want you to feel: Elated!Other Ways You Can Be An Elated SupporterDo you believe in the work Elated does, but don't have the cash to spare?

<h3>Listen up Grateful Americans!</h3>
<p>In just a few short weeks Chris and his fellow Marines will be returning home from a tour in war torn Afghanistan. We are looking to raise money to provide a venue and plenty of food, beverages and activities for the marines, families and guests alike. Anyone who knows Chris or anyone simply wanting to show the support of a grateful nation are welcome to attend. This will be an amazingly good time and with your generous donations can only ensure the best welcome home party possible.</p>
<h3>What we need:</h3>
<p>We estimate needing $800, which will go to renting a facility (likely the Elks Lodge.) The need for a facility ensures plenty of room for guests and parking. Additionally, proceeds will be utilized to provide plenty of hamburgers, hotdogs, snacks and drinks for all in attendence. If money permits we will look into hiring a local band to play.</p>
<h3>The impact:</h3>

He was rushed to Falmouth Hospital where they worked on lowering his body temperature and supporting his other body systems with a breathing tube and sedative medication. Due to the shock from the heat stroke he developed a blood clotting disorder DIC and a muscle breakdown disorder Rhabdomyolysis. His kidneys began to shut down as well. We had him med-flighted to Tufts Medical Center MICU where he received blood products and continuous dialysis. However, after a few days Charlie's liver began to fail and the Doctors were concerned he may need a transplant. We med-flighted him to Lahey Clinic and began the listing process for a liver. Luckily, after 3 days, Charlie's own liver function began improving and he was able to be transferred back to Tufts without transplant. Throughout this whole time we were concerned because Charlie was not waking up despite him being off sedative medication for quite some time.</p>
<p>On Friday, August 31st Charlie began to wake up on his own and his breathing tube was removed. The first thing he asked for was to ""see his girls."" Saturday, Christie and Charlie watched Borat and he even cracked a few jokes. However, later that day we had a major set-back. Charlie cardiac arrested due to an unknown cause. The doctors think he may have had a blood clot which shot to his lungs and his was started on blood thinning medication. Luckily, nurses were right at his bedside within seconds and CPR was performed quickly. A CAT scan did not show any acute issues and Charlie's body temperature was lowered with a machine for 24 hours to preserve brain function. He was sedated, intubated and closely monitored once again.</p>
<p>Charlie is currently at the Spaulding Rehab in Cambridge.  He has remained on Dialysis treatments every M-W-F (3 times per week.) Many of his measurable medical numbers continue to improve a bit each week, however he still has a long way to go before his kidneys recover to an acceptable level.  He still continues to struggle with a wide variety of medical issues. <br/> He has physical therapy 5-6 times per week for about 1 hour. The PT &amp; OT includes range-of-motion exercises, sitting upright in a mobile chair for 2-3 hrs, stretching of muscles &amp; joints, sight-sound work, as well as a variety of tracking, touch &amp; other sensory activities. <br/> He has been off of the ventilator for the past 5 days. This milestone will increase his PT options. <br/> The overall challenges with his condition remain with his limited state of consciousness.  We receive occasional facial expressions/responses from Charlie, such as purposeful blinking and mouth movements, etc...  <br/>  <br/> Spaulding Rehab is doing an excellent job in caring for Charlie and working on the wide variety of his needs. We continue to utilize the services of an outside Nursing agency from 9pm - 6am to supplement &amp; help watch over him when a family member is not there throughout the evening.  Charlie also responds really well to accupuncture, so we have been bringing in the on-staff accupuncturist 1-2 times per week.<br/>  <br/> The entire Papazian family continues to feel and appreciate all your love, prayers and care for Charlie and us all.  We continue to marvel at the support of our Family/Relatives, Friends.  You all have provided so much Love, Support &amp; Kindness.  Your visits, cards, emails, calls, texts, and prayers have been amazing and inspirational.</p>

    In January 2010, a group of student
leaders from Cornell University embarked on what they called the “Fistula Free Climb”, sumitting
Mt. Kilimanjaro in order to raise money and awareness for OperationOF,
a non-profit organization founded by Seth Cochran which helps women suffering
from obstetric fistulas, a horrific and almost unheard of condition. This climb was inspired by Seth Cochran's Summit for Smiles Campaign in 2007 which raised $40,000
for cleft palate surgery for The Smile Train through climb of Mt.
Kilimanjaro.
 
    Inspired by these
momentously altruistic feats, “Mountains for Moms” was born. In January 2012, a new group of
student leaders from Cornell, along with some very inspired and entrepreneurial
alumni, will attempt to summit Mt. Kilimanjaro in support of Obstetric Fistula.

THE IMPACT 
   
Every year nearly 100,000 women are diagnosed with an Obstetric Fistula
(OF) injury. Sustained during childbirth, OF is the result of a tear in the walls
separating a woman’s reproductive and excretory systems. This leads to a
never-ending flow of urine and stool, destroying her life and making her a
social outcast. Today, more than 2
million young women live with untreated OF in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
 
The GOOD NEWS
is: Obstetric Fistula is easily treatable with a simple surgery that costs just
$200 and is effective in 90% of cases. 
 
    Mountains for Moms thinks it’s a severe
injustice that so many women in the developing world receive dramatically
inadequate maternal health care. We are fund raising for OperationOF,
which finds women with obstetric fistula and facilitates their surgical
treatment through a treatment partner. A performance-based funding structure is used to support local surgeons. This ensures a high quality
of care at a low cost of service and allows us to commit 100% of your
donation to the program.

In March of 2008, my father was diagnosed with Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. Cancerous tumors were found in his chest, some of which were surgically removed. Then in June of 2009, his cancer metastasized when a new tumor was found in his lung. This diagnosis usually comes with a life expectancy of maybe a year or two, but sometimes even a few short months. Because my family is a very positive family, we all refused to accept these statistics.</p>
<p>After intense research over the past couple of years, we have found that there is no cure for melanoma, but even worse, there is a very little funding available for melanoma research, comparatively speaking to other forms of cancer. Luckily, we found a new experimental clinical trial treatment being conducted at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. My father was accepted into the trial, and he agreed to participate in it. He was the ninth patient in his phase of the clinical trial, hence the “Patient 9 Foundation.”</p>
<p>This clinical trial was run by Melanoma Specialist, Dr. Stephen Hodi at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. My father was about 4 months into this experimental treatment when his liver failed, in February of 2010. He spent over one month in the hospital on copious amounts of drugs, specifically steroids, to try to get his liver function to return to normal. After this setback, he was not allowed to go back on the experimental treatment, however, the clinical trial drugs worked so well on his melanoma, that they continued in its attack of the tumors in my father’s body.</p>
<p>For over 6 months, things were looking progressively better; the tumors were shrinking and his liver functioning was back to normal. Then in September of 2010, a brain MRI scan showed 5 cancerous lesions in his brain, the biggest of which is located on his cerebellum which has affected his motor control, balance and coordination. Follow-up full body scans uncovered several other new tumors as well as growth in the pre-existing ones. It seemed as though the uphill battle was becoming evermore steep with each new scan, but we all refused to give up hope.

<p>For me, the sky is the limit, and I will not stop until I reach my goal. This foundation means everything to my father, my family, my supporters and to me. Please help join the support and spread the awareness. Thank you</p></div>","My name is Cole Winarick. I am 18 years old and am currently a freshman at the University of Delaware. In March of 2008, my father was diagnosed with Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. Cancerous tumors were found in his chest, some of which were surgically removed. Then in June of 2009, his cancer metastasized when a new tumor was found in his lung. This diagnosis usually comes with a life expectancy of maybe a year or two, but sometimes even a few short months. Because my family is a very positive family, we all refused to accept these statistics.
After intense research over the past couple of years, we have found that there is no cure for melanoma, but even worse, there is a very little funding available for melanoma research, comparatively speaking to other forms of cancer. Luckily, we found a new experimental clinical trial treatment being conducted at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. My father was accepted into the trial, and he agreed to participate in it. He was the ninth patient in his phase of the clinical trial, hence the “Patient 9 Foundation.”
This clinical trial was run by Melanoma Specialist, Dr. Stephen Hodi at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. My father was about 4 months into this experimental treatment when his liver failed, in February of 2010. He spent over one month in the hospital on copious amounts of drugs, specifically steroids, to try to get his liver function to return to normal. After this setback, he was not allowed to go back on the experimental treatment, however, the clinical trial drugs worked so well on his melanoma, that they continued in its attack of the tumors in my father’s body.
For over 6 months, things were looking progressively better; the tumors were shrinking and his liver functioning was back to normal. Then in September of 2010, a brain MRI scan showed 5 cancerous lesions in his brain, the biggest of which is located on his cerebellum which has affected his motor control, balance and coordination. Follow-up full body scans uncovered several other new tumors as well as growth in the pre-existing ones. It seemed as though the uphill battle was becoming evermore steep with each new scan, but we all refused to give up hope. Again, the doctors at Dana Farber had a plan and he had to undergo whole head radiation and even more pinpointed stereotactic radiation.
After a lifetime of smiles, family, friends, and joy, my father passed away on June 25, 2011 from melanoma cancer. It had affected our family, our friends, and myself greatly. Life has been different without him, but I will always know he is with me.

My story.... In February of 2012 I ended up hospitalized due to severe stomach pains. An ultra sound was issued and it was found that I had a large tear in my inner abdominal wall. I was scheduled for surgery a day and a half later and they cut my abdominal wall open to repair the inner structure.  During the surgery (5 1/2 hours) I ended up losing about a unit of blood. I was eventually released to go home, and that was where the long road to recovery begins... The following weekend I ended up falling and me being bullheaded did not go back to the doctors right away. I was eventually admitted to the hospital with blood clots and was not able able to return to work for 6 weeks. Finally returning to work I had continued to experience a lot of discomfort due to the surgery and was told I eventually needed another to repair some of the damage from the first surgery that did not heal correctly. During the first surgery a 5 1/2 inch piece of mesh was used to repair the tear in my abdominal wall. We were left with several thousand in medical bills and having a family with two kids have been trying to pay them off before accumulating more medical bills in regards to the next surgery. We are a family that never tries to ask for help, but have come to the realization that sometimes one must do such a thing.   Any help would be greatly appreciated as we come from low income professions, my wife being a teacher and myself in law enforcement/corrections.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Larry is my dad. Three years ago he battled against prostate cancer by having surgery. He was clear for a year then it came back. After a round of chemotherapy, it was gone, but as he is the sole provider for my mom and diabetic younger brother, the family had amassed a lot of debt. <br/><br/>This June 2012, he went to work one day as if all was normal and began slurring his words. His boss called an ambulance thinking it was a stroke. After many CT, MRI, and PET scans, plus a liver and brain biopsy, he got a new diagnosis of glioblastoma- a very aggressive cancer of the brain. The prognosis with this cancer is very poor- estimates put the survival time after diagnosis if untreated at 3 months and if treated, somewhere between a year and 18 months. Our family is crushed. He has been a healthy, hard-working, brilliant man his whole life and a wonderful father. <br/><br/>It is now 6 weeks after his diagnosis and he is halfway through rounds of chemotherapy and radiation. The doctors can't operate because the tumor is too close to the motor control center of his brain and they are afraid it would render him completely paralyzed, if not kill him. In that time he has gone from looking and acting perfectly normal to being given a wheelchair because he can't walk. He has trouble comprehending words and even more trouble forming words so that he gets very frustrated trying to communicate. He occasionally loses use of the right side of his body so that my mom is having to feed him.</p>
<p>He has swelling in his brain and has had one violent seizure already that left him unable to speak at all for 24 hours. He is on steroids, chemo, radiation, anticoagulants, and anticonvulsants.<br/><br/></p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>It took nearly a month before his short-term unemployment benefits kicked in. The insurance company insisted on a diagnosis before they would give him anything. And that required scheduling a liver biopsy (for another questionable lesion) and waiting for those results- which were inconclusive. Then scheduling a brain biopsy, mailing it off, waiting for results...In all that time the family has had no money coming in. Extended family members have been chipping in to pay for groceries and my brother's insulin ($200 a month,) but we don't have a ton of spare money ourselves. The money finally came from the insurance but it was less than promised because they told us it wouldn't be taxed but it is being.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Please help us provide groceries to Dad, Mom, and my brother, and help pay for my brother's insulin. That's the main point of this fund but if more money can be made, it will go towards paying off some of their bills which are in collection and turning on their phone which has been shut off.</div>

<div>This photo used in the campaign is of my dad and me, taken when he was told he had a brain tumor but before the biopsy was back and he was given the news that it is incurable.

A lifetime soccer player, Lew’s active and healthy lifestyle stirred shock and disbelief as Lew went on to face a 2<sup>nd</sup> heart attack in 2003 which led to a 6-Bypass surgery. His children were 6, 2 and newborn at the time, and since then he and his family have faced unimaginable odds together as he never stopped working to secure employment that would support his family and provide healthcare. Lew has dedicated his professional life to serving people, committing 15 years to working with foster youth that together can only be described as inspirational and remarkable. Though challenges remained constant, his love for his family has never let up as everything he has done has been for them. His children, now 15, 11 and 9, have lived a financially simple life thus far that has been rich in ways most cannot fathom, as they embrace every day they have with him. They are a family that has been touched by the near-death reality that comes from facing heart attacks and a bypass surgery together. They embrace moments we commonly take for granted, and they love each other and appreciate life out of their experiences together thus far. Lew is my best friend, and approaching this campaign has been difficult in that his loving wife has nowhere else to go. In her search for a minimal amount of funds that would secure his health coverage for a few months, she was completely out of options. Healthcare providers can hesitate, delay and react differently with patients who lack health insurance, and it is devastating to imagine that this factor alone could keep him from receiving the medical attention he needs and in the time frame he needs it, something that could be life threatening in the days and weeks to come as those familiar symptoms have not only resurfaced but worsened. A family needs to know that it did all they could to get their dad and husband the care he needs. I don’t know how his children would cope with the reality that perhaps something could have, but wasn’t, done to treat their Dad so that he could continue being the ever-present and loving father he has always been. I can only aspire to be the wonderful father he is to my own 3 children. He is a true human being in every sense who is loved by many. As difficult as it is for us to step up and ask, we humbly seek donations of even $1 that can serve to help reach our current goal of $2000. Two of us raised $400 over the weekend so far. This amount would cover a few months of premiums as well as basic sustenance for his family as they are between home and hospital. Lew is presently in CCU awaiting confirmation for an angiogram appointment that may likely confirm the need for another bypass procedure. Though we cannot alleviate his very real fear, we can perhaps help him to breathe a bit easier as he would know that his family is carrying less of a burden through it all. “To know that even one life has breathed easier because you have lived … this is to have succeeded.” (Ralph Waldo Emerson.) Thank you for touching his life through the simple act of reading this. Please pray for him and his family in the coming days and weeks. <var id=""yiv606245156yui-ie-cursor""></var></span></p></div>","Lewis Garcia is a 48 year old husband and father who has suffered from steady heart problems since 1998 when he had his first heart attack at the age of 35.

<p>- Team Snug Vest</p></div>","Who are we?
We are Squeezease Therapy, a small team based in Vancouver, British Columbia commmitted to improve the lives of individuals with autism through the development of the Snug Vest.  Our goal in the next few months is to make the vest available for everyone who needs one. Visit www.snugvest.com to know more about our company.
What is the Snug Vest?
The Snug Vest is an inflatable therapy garment used for administering evenly-distributed pressure to the sides, shoulders, and back of the torso.  The vest provides Deep Pressure Therapy to relieve anxiety and increase focus and attention for individuals with sensory and anxiety disorders. Click here to read more about the Snug Vest. 
What is Autism?
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a life-long developmental disability and neurological dysfunction that affects 1 in 88 children in North America. Individuals diagnosed with autism often have an impaired ability to communicate and engage in social interactions.

Why do we need funding?
We currently have a number of eager parents who want to offer the Snug Vest as a treatment to their child's needs, but currently do not have the capacity to meet this demand. With the funding provided, we can produce more Snug Vests of different sizes at a faster rate by investing in the necessary tools and equipment.

What is our goal?
Our goal is to raise $20,000 to create customized tools that can help make our Snug Vests in larger quantities at a faster rate. Every dollar that is given to this project will go directly towards getting the vest on to the backs of those who this will help.   
What are the perks?
In return for every contribution of $600, you will be providing a Snug Vest to a child in need. Other rewards include T-Shirts, Squeeze Bears, Plush Bears, Massagers, and Pillow Sets. With every contribution over $10, you will receive a personalized card from us and a thank-you from a child waiting for a Snug Vest.

<p><b>How does my child use the ISSA mikro?</b></p>
<p>Depending on their age, children can use the ISSA mikro by themselves or have an adult brush with them. The ISSA mikro has been designed with an ergonomic, lightweight handle so children's small hands can get a comfortable grip when using it by themselves. We recommend always having an adult supervise brushing routines. </p>
<ol>
<li>Press the center button once for Brush Mode and a second time for Massage Mode. Depending on your child's age, use with a dentist recommended amount of infant-formulated soothing gel or toothpaste. </li>
<li>Use the same way as a manual toothbrush, and brush teeth and massage gums with wide, circular movements for two minutes.</li>
<li>Press the center button a third time to turn off the device and rinse. </li>
</ol>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461029737/D_zjti1l.png"" src="""" style=""width: 617.207px;height: 221px;""/></p></div>
<p>Note: The ISSA mikro comes with a How To Guide in the package, plus all Indiegogo supporters will be sent a downloadable Full Manual via email when we ship the perks.<br/> </p>
<p><b>Does the ISSA mikro have a spinning brush head?</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">No, the ISSA mikro uses gentle pulsations instead of spinning action to gently yet effectively clean baby teeth and gums. It is designed to be used with the same circular movement used with a manual toothbrush.</span><br/> </p>
<p><b>Can babies chew on the ISSA mikro?</b></p>
<p><span>The ISSA mikro is made from safe, food-grade silicone that’s free of BPA and phthalates, plus its brush head is non-detachable. It is therefore safe for babies to chew on during their brushing routine; however, we recommend the ISSA mikro only be used as an oral-care device and not as a teething toy.</span><br/> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What is Sonic Pulse Technology and is it safe for babies and young children?</b></p>
<p><span>FOREO's Sonic Pulse Technology is essentially gentle vibrations that are completely safe for babies. The sensation feels pleasant and soothing on their teeth and gums. The ISSA mikro channels up to 6,000 gentle pulsations through the soft and flexible silicone per minute and has two speeds so you can also adjust the intensity to suit your baby’s needs and comfort level. We recommend you consult your dental-care professional before adding any new products to your child’s oral-care routine.</span><br/> </p>
<p><b>How do the Smile Helpers help track my child’s brushing? </b></p>
<p><span>The ISSA mikro has two Smile Helpers that appear when the center button is pressed to turn the device on. “Glee” (happy face) appears after 2 minutes of brushing and “Glum” (sad face) appears if your child hasn’t brushed in over 12 hours. “Glee” and “Glum” will both light up if your child hasn’t brushed for the full 2 minutes. The ISSA mikro also has an integrated timer that will lightly pulse to indicate when you should brush another quadrant of the month and to signify the end of the 2-minute brushing routine.</span><br/> </p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What clinical studies and safety tests have been done for the ISSA mikro?</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In order to create the safest product for your children and ours, we’ve extensively tested the ISSA mikro. It is PVC-, phthalate-, latex-, and BPA-free. It has been tested by SGS, the largest product material company in the world. Its safety certifications include RoHS Compliant, CE Safety Mark, and IPX7 Protection. The device has also undergone extensive internal testing and clinical trials to confirm its ability to effectively clean teeth and massage gums.</span><br/> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>How do I clean the ISSA mikro?</b></p>
<p><span>After each brushing routine, rinse the ISSA mikro with clean running water. The medical-grade silicone bristles prevents bacteria buildup allowing the ISSA mikro to stay clean and hygienic between uses!<br/><br/>For additional sterilization, the ISSA mikro can be washed in the dishwasher: using a maximum temperature setting of 80 degrees Celsius, use a 1-hour wash/rinse cycle and a 30-minute drying cycle. You can also use a baby bottle sterilizer with a maximum temperature of 100 degrees Celsius for a maximum of 20 minutes.</span><br/> </p>
<p><b>How often do I need to replace the ISSA mikro?</b></p>
<p><span>Because of its completely encased, one-piece design and hygienic silicone material, you never have to purchase a replacement brush head for the ISSA mikro.

</div></div>","ISSA mikro now available on foreo.com!       
How does my child use the ISSA mikro?
Depending on their age, children can use the ISSA mikro by themselves or have an adult brush with them. The ISSA mikro has been designed with an ergonomic, lightweight handle so children's small hands can get a comfortable grip when using it by themselves. We recommend always having an adult supervise brushing routines. 

Press the center button once for Brush Mode and a second time for Massage Mode. Depending on your child's age, use with a dentist recommended amount of infant-formulated soothing gel or toothpaste. 
Use the same way as a manual toothbrush, and brush teeth and massage gums with wide, circular movements for two minutes.
Press the center button a third time to turn off the device and rinse. 


Note: The ISSA mikro comes with a How To Guide in the package, plus all Indiegogo supporters will be sent a downloadable Full Manual via email when we ship the perks. 
Does the ISSA mikro have a spinning brush head?
No, the ISSA mikro uses gentle pulsations instead of spinning action to gently yet effectively clean baby teeth and gums. It is designed to be used with the same circular movement used with a manual toothbrush. 
Can babies chew on the ISSA mikro?
The ISSA mikro is made from safe, food-grade silicone that’s free of BPA and phthalates, plus its brush head is non-detachable. It is therefore safe for babies to chew on during their brushing routine; however, we recommend the ISSA mikro only be used as an oral-care device and not as a teething toy. 
 
What is Sonic Pulse Technology and is it safe for babies and young children?
FOREO's Sonic Pulse Technology is essentially gentle vibrations that are completely safe for babies. The sensation feels pleasant and soothing on their teeth and gums. The ISSA mikro channels up to 6,000 gentle pulsations through the soft and flexible silicone per minute and has two speeds so you can also adjust the intensity to suit your baby’s needs and comfort level. We recommend you consult your dental-care professional before adding any new products to your child’s oral-care routine. 
How do the Smile Helpers help track my child’s brushing? 
The ISSA mikro has two Smile Helpers that appear when the center button is pressed to turn the device on. “Glee” (happy face) appears after 2 minutes of brushing and “Glum” (sad face) appears if your child hasn’t brushed in over 12 hours. “Glee” and “Glum” will both light up if your child hasn’t brushed for the full 2 minutes. The ISSA mikro also has an integrated timer that will lightly pulse to indicate when you should brush another quadrant of the month and to signify the end of the 2-minute brushing routine. 
What clinical studies and safety tests have been done for the ISSA mikro?
In order to create the safest product for your children and ours, we’ve extensively tested the ISSA mikro. It is PVC-, phthalate-, latex-, and BPA-free. It has been tested by SGS, the largest product material company in the world. Its safety certifications include RoHS Compliant, CE Safety Mark, and IPX7 Protection. The device has also undergone extensive internal testing and clinical trials to confirm its ability to effectively clean teeth and massage gums. 
 
How do I clean the ISSA mikro?
After each brushing routine, rinse the ISSA mikro with clean running water. The medical-grade silicone bristles prevents bacteria buildup allowing the ISSA mikro to stay clean and hygienic between uses!For additional sterilization, the ISSA mikro can be washed in the dishwasher: using a maximum temperature setting of 80 degrees Celsius, use a 1-hour wash/rinse cycle and a 30-minute drying cycle. You can also use a baby bottle sterilizer with a maximum temperature of 100 degrees Celsius for a maximum of 20 minutes. 
How often do I need to replace the ISSA mikro?
Because of its completely encased, one-piece design and hygienic silicone material, you never have to purchase a replacement brush head for the ISSA mikro. Plus, it has a long battery life: 1 hour of charging delivers approximately 8 months of use! After 5 years of age, your child can upgrade to the ISSA mini. 
Can my child use ISSA mikro with toothpaste or a soothing gel?
Yes. Depending on your child's age, use with a dentist recommended amount of infant-formulated soothing gel or toothpaste. We do not recommend using tooth powder or products with bleachers with children. 
Can my child use ISSA mikro if they have mouth ulcers, tooth decay, gum disease, or any other oral conditions?
We suggest that anyone who suffers from a serious oral condition should consult their dental-care professional before using an ISSA electric toothbrush. 
What is the difference between all of the ISSA toothbrushes? 
The ISSA is an adult electric toothbrush that has a 100% silicone-bristle brush head. It is perfect for those with gum recession or sensitivities.
The ISSA hybrid is an adult electric toothbrush that has PBT polymer bristles surrounded by silicone bristles. It’s perfect for those who prefer a more vigorous brushing, as well as a gentle gum massage. Although we are not offering the full ISSA hybrid toothbrush via our Indiegogo perks, we are including an ISSA hybrid brush head in select bundles so that those who purchase an ISSA can also try the hybrid technology!

Many of these chemicals are endocrine disruptors that interfere with the natural hormones in our bodies and can cause health effects.The Detox Me™ Action Kit is an easy and non-invasive urine test that detects the presence of 10 common household toxics in your body. You’ll receive a personalized digital report that compares your results with the aggregate data collected from all Detox Me™ participants and gives you concrete actions you can take to reduce your body’s chemical load.  The Detox Me™ Action Kit is part of a scientific study run by Silent Spring Institute, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. We’re crowdfunding this study to get a better sense of our collective exposure to harmful environmental chemicals. Taking part in the study not only will empower you to live a healthier life, you will also be helping us generate new scientific knowledge about everyday chemical exposures. These data can support stronger policies that protect people from dangerous chemicals in consumer products. Why should I get tested?Knowledge is not just power, but a prescription for prevention! Your personalized report…
indicates your level of exposure to particular toxics and shows how you compare with others in the study and in the U.S.
informs you about what is known about the health risks associated with each chemical
helps identify the likely sources of your exposure
warns you if your exposure is much higher than others in the study
shows you how to use our Detox Me™ smartphone app to help you reduce your exposures and see how low you can go
 This is good for Silent Spring Institute because…
it will help us further our mission to empower consumers to take action to lower unnecessary exposures to harmful chemicals called endocrine disruptors that interfere with the body’s hormones
it will allow us to better characterize the public’s exposure to toxic chemicals and identify important sources of exposure
findings from the study could lead to new ways of reducing exposures and better public oversight of the use of chemicals in consumer products
Together, we can create a healthier environment for everyone. As seen in… ""It Tears You Down, and Builds You Up,"" October 28, 2016 (Season 1, Episode 72)“The Truth About Toxins,” August 12, 2016 (Season 4, episode 5) What chemicals does it test for?Currently, our test screens for 10 of the most common household and environmental chemicals:
Bisphenol A (BPA)
Bisphenol S (BPS)
Benzophenone-3 (BP-3)
Triclosan (TCS)
Triclocarban (TCC)
2,4-dichlorophenol (24-DCP)
2,5-dichlorophenol (25-DCP)
Butyl paraben (B-PB)
Ethyl paraben (E-PB)
Methyl paraben (M-PB)
 Many of these chemicals are endocrine disruptors and all of them can have harmful effects on your body. Some mimic estrogen or block androgen, so they may affect child development, fertility, and increase your risk of some cancers. By understanding the levels of these toxics in your body, you can begin to take action to reduce your exposures. If this campaign is successful, we plan to add additional chemicals to the test, including flame retardants. Through our Action Kit report, and by using our Detox Me™ app, you will learn how to avoid:
lotions and other personal care products that include parabens and benzophenone
plastics commonly used in food packaging and processing that include BPA and BPS, a common BPA substitute
antibacterial products containing triclosan and DCP
Why these 10?The Detox Me™ Action Kit tests for 10 common endocrine disruptors—chemicals that mimic and interfere with the body’s naturally occurring hormones. Hormones regulate many important activities in your body, so endocrine disrupting chemicals raise concerns ranging from effects on fertility to child development to cancer.These 10 chemicals have been detected at different levels in people throughout the U.S., but detecting these chemicals in your urine doesn’t mean you will get sick. It is not known if exposure levels in the general population are above or below levels that cause health effects. Some people are more sensitive to effects than others, and the chemicals can act together, producing effects as a mixture that are not predicted from concentrations of each chemical on its own.Given these uncertainties, some people may want to reduce their exposures as a precaution while scientists continue to study the effects. (Bergman et. al. 2013) You can learn more about endocrine disruptors and precautionary action in these statements from Project TENDR, the United Nations Environment Programme and World Health Organization, and the Endocrine Society. 
Triclosan and Triclocarban are antibacterial and antifungal agents found in consumer products, including toothpaste, soaps, detergents, toys, and surgical cleaning treatments. Triclosan has been shown to alter thyroid and reproductive hormone levels and reproductive development in animals (Kumar 2009, Stoker 2010, Feng 2016). Studies in breast cancer cells show that both triclosan and triclocarban have the potential to alter the normal activity of estrogen (Gee et. al. 2008 and Ahn et. al 2008). The FDA recently banned the use of triclosan in some personal care products. 
2,5-DCP is a breakdown product of 1,4-DCB, which is used in mothballs and some toilet deodorizers. 1,4-DCB is classified as a possible human carcinogen (IARC 1999) and has been shown to affect the thyroid gland and thyroid hormone levels in rats (Elcombe et al. 2002). In human adolescents, levels of 2,5-DCP in urine were associated with thyroid hormone levels and hypothyroidism (Wei and Zhu 2016). 
2,4-DCP is a breakdown product of the widely-used herbicide 2,4-D, and may have other sources. It has been shown to affect the regulation and production of sex hormones and reduce egg hatching success in zebrafish (Ma et al. 2012). 
BPA and BPS are chemicals used in some plastics, food and beverage packaging, and receipt paper. BPA is listed under California Proposition 65 as known to cause reproductive toxicity in women. BPA levels in the general population appear to be below levels where health effects are reported in animal studies, but there isn't clear evidence that current exposures are safe and BPA/BPS can act additively with other chemicals. BPA is estrogenic and alters development of the breast and prostate (Dhimolea et. al. 2014 and Acevedo et. al. 2013). BPS, sometimes used as a substitute to BPA, is estrogenic in rats (Yamasaki et al. 2004) and affects the production and regulation of sex hormones in zebrafish (Ji et al. 2013). BPA and BPS both affect brain development and behavior in zebrafish (Kinch 2015). 
Benzophenone-3 is a chemical found in many sunscreen products. BP-3 has the potential to alter estrogen activity in breast cancer cells (Suzuki et. al. 2005). One study in humans shows changes in hormone concentrations for groups with highest exposure to BP-3 and parabens while another does not (Aker et. al. 2016, Scinicariello et. al. 2016). 
Parabens are the most widely used preservatives in personal care products; they stop fungus, bacteria and other microbes from growing in creams and makeup. Parabens can interact with hormone receptors, similar to natural hormones like estrogen, and have been detected in breast tissue (Okubo et al., 2001 and Barr et al., 2012). For men, parabens may be associated with sperm DNA damage (Meeker et al., 2011). Who is it for?Our Detox Me™ Action Kit is for anyone age 18 and over who is curious about the toxic chemicals that might be lurking in their home or residing in their body.While toxic chemicals in your everyday environment can affect your personal health, they also can affect your children’s health. Studies show that exposure to chemicals during critical periods of development—in the womb, during puberty, or during pregnancy—can increase the risk of health problems later in life. These critical periods, commonly referred to as “windows of susceptibility,” represent important stages in life when the body is developing and is most vulnerable to the effects of toxic chemicals.Exposure to environmental chemicals early in life has been linked with cancer, poor brain development, obesity, diabetes, and other health effects. Because babies and small children spend lots of time on the floor, crawling, playing, and putting their hands in their mouths, they are at higher risk for exposure to pollutants in house dust.  Research by Silent Spring Institute has shown that numerous chemicals in consumer products build up in air and dust indoors, and these chemicals can end up in people’s bodies. By understanding what your own chemical levels are, you can take steps to protect your family from potentially harmful exposures, and reduce their risk of developing health problems in the future.By participating in our study, you will be joining a large community that is working to advance science on chemical exposures and create a healthier environment not only for you and your family, but for everyone and for generations to come. Testimonials / quotes “The biomonitoring I did with Silent Spring Institute was revelatory.

<h3>I.  Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>1.  <u>The Purpose</u></strong>.  This campaign is to raise funds for us to buy the Hover Passport selfie-drone (<a href=""https://gethover.com/hover-camera-passport?d=pc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://gethover.com/hover-camera-passport?d=pc</a>) so we can make and post an on-going series of on-the-go short videos of people using the Rocket Rower. The goal of the series of videos is to drive awareness of the power, fun and flexibility of Rocket Rowers to address the epidemic of sitting by giving people short intervals of cardio exercise throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>2.  <u>The Inventor</u></strong>.  Tim Higginson invented the Rocket Rower for himself as a simple, effective and fun solution to the problem that he sits too much.  Rowing is one of the great all-body exercises. But traditional rowing machines are too big (and expensive) to go where most people sit, not to mention that they require you to sit while using them.  So, Tim (who rowed on top competitive teams for years) designed the world's first STAND-UP rowing machine that fits anywhere, is a fraction of the size and cost of standard rowing machines and adds a new dimension because you row straight upwards, just like a rocket.  He's an avid inventor and entrepreneur.  He holds multiple patents in the US and overseas.  His background includes writing software for spacecraft.  He's designed and built products ranging from sun protective gear to cloud apps.</p>
<p><strong>3.  <u>The Problem</u></strong>. Lack of physical motion is staggeringly bad for us, with very serious health and long term consequences.  And, here's the kicker:  it is not enough to exercise before or after a day of sitting.  And, standing at your desk isn't enough either.  </p>
<p>Read this article about the importance of regular intervals of cardio exercise all through the day <a href=""https://www.today.com/series/one-small-thing/sitting-bad-your-health-move-every-30-minutes-t116207"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.today.com/series/one-small-thing/si...</a>.</p>

<p>You can also watch multiple TED talks on how bad sitting is for us.</p>
<p><strong>4.  <u>What is Needed</u></strong>.  The key is to get physical motion that gives cardio exercise as many times in the day as possible.  <strong>In short, quick intervals of cardio exercise throughout the day are critical to our health. </strong></p>
<p><strong>5.  <u>The Solution</u></strong>.  Rocket Rowers do exactly that.  They are the world's first ""at your desk"" short interval cardio motion platform.  They fit pretty much anywhere people sit, and are ready for use on a second's notice.  They provide rigorous all-body cardio motion in a few seconds.  Most people can fit 30 or 60 seconds of motion into their day at multiple times, such as after finished a call, sending an email, updating a document, etc.  We want people to think of using the Rocket Rower as a reward for getting things done during their day.  That way, it becomes built in and marks all the successes people have during their day, leading not only to intervals of cardio motion throughout their day, but also a feeling of accomplishment at all that they have achieved.</p>
<p><strong>6.  <u>How does the Rocket Rower work?</u></strong>  The design inspiration for the Rocket Rower is quite literally competition-level rowing shells.  The question was how to take one of those, and make it work beside a desk.  The key to the answer was to rotate it 90 degrees to vertical.  This allowed us to strip out all the size and complexity, and reduce it down to the two most important features:  (1) an inclined platform, and (2) a resistance tube.  The inclined foot platform is used in all rowing shells to allow for a deeper knee bend for a longer leg push.  We took that platform and combined all the other complexity of rowing machines into it:  the moving seat, the oar riggers and oar locks, etc.  Our inclined platform is held in place by the user's weight, and has a swappable ""oar lock"" system for quickly changing out resistance tubes of various strengths.  By changing the ""oar"" into resistance tubes, we got rid of all the complex air, water and other resistance systems in rowing machines.  By changing the ""oar lock"" into a quick-change keyhole design embedded in the platform, a user can change among different strength resistance tubes on the fly in seconds.  (Trust us - or even better, try it for yourself - even the lightest resistance tube makes for a rigorous 30 or 60 second workout!)   </p>
<p><strong>7.  <u>No sweating!</u></strong>  By designing and building a system that gives cardio exercise in short intervals of 30 to 60 seconds, users don't build up a sweat.  People can fit 30 or 60 seconds of cardio exercise into their day right beside their desk or workspace whenever they finish a phone call, send an email, close a document, walk back from a meeting, or basically anytime they want.  There's always at least 3 to 5 times in a day when people step on a Rocket Rower right where they are and do 30 or 60 seconds of real motion with cardio.</p>
<p><strong>8.  <u>What about standing desks and balance boards?</u></strong>  These do not provide cardio exercise, and studies show that short intervals of cardio motion throughout the day are very important.  That's what Rocket Rowers solve.  </p>

<h3>III.  What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funding will enable us to buy this selfie drone:  <a href=""https://gethover.com/hover-camera-passport?d=pc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://gethover.com/hover-camera-passport?d=pc</a> (including extra battery, protective case and extra propellers).</p>
<p>We will use the selfie drone to make and post short, dynamic videos of the Rocket Rower in a whole range of fun contexts to increase our outreach efforts to educate people and businesses on the dangers of sitting, and get Rocket Rowers to more people for cardio at their desks.</p>
<p>Our perks range from a beautiful and totally useful microfiber lens cloths with a Rocket Rower logo, to discounts on buying Rocket Rowers to unique, one-off Rocket Rowers with custom artwork by a local artist.</p>
<p>If we raise less than our full goal, the funds will <strong>still</strong> help increase the quality and reach of our messaging about the dangers of sitting, and the importance of short intervals of cardio exercise through the day.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>IV.  The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is valuable to you as a contributor and many, many people in our society because educating people (including employers for the health of their employees) on the importance of getting short intervals of cardio exercise throughout the day is truly important for the health of all of us and the people we love. </p>
<p>By contributing to this Rocket Rower campaign, you will be helping fight back against the societal epidemic of sitting by providing people with education and a powerful antidote in the form not of drug or after-the-fact treatment, but an up-front simple, powerful, fun exercise platform that empowers people to stand up and get short intervals of cardio motion right at their desk.</p>
<p>Your contribution will also help build this small company into a larger one.  We're already helping provide jobs for people around Massachusetts.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>V.  Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We finished the design, prototyping and other development phases and starting full commercial manufacturing earlier in 2017.  We are selling and delivering Rocket Rowers to individuals and businesses now.  We are steadily learning from and improving on our first-round efforts at educating and bringing Rocket Rowers to people and businesses.</p>
<p>We have removed the manufacturing risk because we're already successfully manufacturing, shipping and delivering Rocket Rowers.  If demand increases fast, we will need to meet the challenge of scaling our manufacturing and fulfillment capabilities. </p>
<p>Our biggest immediate challenge is spreading the word about the importance of cardio exercise throughout the day, and Rocket Rowers as a simple, powerful and fun solution.  We are using a mix of direct outreach to owners and chief health officers of businesses to get these for their employees, social media posts and a very small amount of online advertising.  We would very much like to add some public relations, better product photos and website design and other improvements.</p>
