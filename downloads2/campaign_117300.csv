</ul><h3><strong>A Gruesome History</strong></h3><ul>
<li>In April of 2013, Doc Rotten and Thomas Mariani of the American Horror Story Fan Podcast and the Monster Movie Podcast teamed up with The Black Saint and Dave Dreher from HorrorNews.Net to form the Grue-Crew and to begin the weekly Horror News Radio Podcast, featuring the latest horror news and reviews.<br/> </li>
<li>Since then, they have expanded their podcast network to include the Hannibal Fan Podcast, Decades of Horror: 1970s, Decades of Horror: 1980s, Decades of Horror: 1990s, and the HNR Extra podcasts.<br/> </li>
<li>In October of 2015, the Grue-Crew joined with a large number of their friends and co-hosts to launch the online version of Gruesome Magazine. In the past 12 months, Gruesome Magazine’s international array of reviewers and correspondents have published <strong>over 1000 articles, reviews, podcasts, and contests.<br/> </strong>
</li>
<li>Gruesome Magazine’s contributors have covered a whole slate of conventions and film festivals around the world to bring you the latest in horror movie news and reviews.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<strong>Content: </strong>The Gruesome Magazine editorial staff has already lined up the writers (the Grue-Crew), has mapped out content for the first issue, and has already begun planning articles for the second issue due this Summer.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Printing: </strong>Lulu.com will be handling the printing of the physical copies as well as the distribution of the digital copies. With the print-on-demand model, the cost of fulfilling the print copies is fully covered by the perk levels.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Perks: </strong>Vendors have been procured for most of the other perks. They are still looking for a vendor for the stress balls and for some additional perks they would like to add.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3><p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">We understand that not everyone has spare cash on hand. If you want to help, but are temporarily short on funds, you can still help out by:</p><ul>
<li>Telling your like-minded friends, family, and co-workers about Gruesome Magazine</li>
<li>Share this campaign on all your social media account.</li>

A Gruesome History
In April of 2013, Doc Rotten and Thomas Mariani of the American Horror Story Fan Podcast and the Monster Movie Podcast teamed up with The Black Saint and Dave Dreher from HorrorNews.Net to form the Grue-Crew and to begin the weekly Horror News Radio Podcast, featuring the latest horror news and reviews. 
Since then, they have expanded their podcast network to include the Hannibal Fan Podcast, Decades of Horror: 1970s, Decades of Horror: 1980s, Decades of Horror: 1990s, and the HNR Extra podcasts. 
In October of 2015, the Grue-Crew joined with a large number of their friends and co-hosts to launch the online version of Gruesome Magazine. In the past 12 months, Gruesome Magazine’s international array of reviewers and correspondents have published over 1000 articles, reviews, podcasts, and contests. 

Gruesome Magazine’s contributors have covered a whole slate of conventions and film festivals around the world to bring you the latest in horror movie news and reviews.
Risks & Challenges

Content: The Gruesome Magazine editorial staff has already lined up the writers (the Grue-Crew), has mapped out content for the first issue, and has already begun planning articles for the second issue due this Summer. 

Printing: Lulu.com will be handling the printing of the physical copies as well as the distribution of the digital copies. With the print-on-demand model, the cost of fulfilling the print copies is fully covered by the perk levels. 

Perks: Vendors have been procured for most of the other perks. They are still looking for a vendor for the stress balls and for some additional perks they would like to add.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Glory Writers</i><br/><br/>My name is Deanna Drogan and I am the author of Glory Writers. I wrote this book because there is so much amazing Christian content out there, whether it be books, blogs, or songs, but not many discuss the process and divine inspiration that goes into them.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what it looks like to write an impactful Christian book and, more importantly, that you will learn the amazing ways that writing allows us to connect with the Lord. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for Christian writing in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you grow closer to the Lord through a powerful way of communication.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about Christian writing through:<ul>
<li>Several wise Christian authors who are experienced in the field and have amazing stories to tell and insight to share.</li>
<li>My own personal testimony and how God has used writing itself to communicate with me and change me in incredible ways.</li>
<li>The infallible Scriptures and things God has strongly put on my heart to share with you.</li>
</ul> You will love this book if you love to write or simply have a passion for creativity.<br/><br/>Glory Writers is a non-fiction book that speaks to aspiring writers and content creators who are seeking to use their gifts and skills for the glory of God.<h2> </h2>
<h2>The Book - Glory Writers</h2>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + additional chapters. The readers will learn about shifting their mindsets to writing for the glory of God rather than their own fame as well as different ways to implement divine inspiration into their writing and create a clear pathway with no distractions to hear God best. They will also learn the power of vulnerability and how writing authentically has the power to change lives.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 4-7. In these chapters the readers will learn about the power of words and the ways that writing can not only impact their audience but themselves as the writers. They will also learn about how to surrender and put themselves in a position to be used best by God. Lastly, they will learn how to combat attacks from the enemy and understand the victory they have in Christ.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 8-10. These chapters delve into identity and understanding that identity does not come from success or a vocation, but from Jesus Christ Himself. The readers will also understand through this chapter that in being authors they are taking on a role of leadership with the unique opportunity to reach people on a higher platform.<h2> </h2>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>

<p>Since October of 2011, Fiopa has been touring America, offering workshops in consensus, facilitation, non-violence, intentional community, agenda planning, minutes taking, how to start a Food Not Bombs, etc., to Occupy groups.

<p>•Substitute any perk above for a guest post on Hippie Chick Diaries---What would you like to say to the HCD audience? Perhaps you or your pet have some ideas to share with the world!</p>
<p><strong>Together We Are Making a Difference</strong></p>
<p>Early in their adult lives, C.T. was a theater producer and Wren went to film school for screenwriting. And I was studying to be a couch tester. We diverted from our paths, not because we changed our desires, but because, through our activism, we learned that social technologies like Value-Based Consensus, creative conflict resolution, Non-Violent Communication, ZEGG Forum, etc., were the structural keys to changing the world. The visions of how to make things better are all great---Permaculture, natural building, dog parks, bike co-ops, community gardens, direct action, etc. But whether these social change strategies succeed or fail is determined by how we talk, listen to each other and how we create buy-in.</p>
<p>AND WE WANT THE GREAT IDEAS PEOPLE ARE COMING UP WITH TO SUCCEED!</p>
<p>So we must stay on the road, teaching these skills. These cooperative concepts not taught in schools or obedience classes. Can you help? We have the experience, and our pedagogy is blossoming in exciting ways. Will you help get us down the road?</p>
<p>I teach that the best use of consensus is to decide to take a nap, go for a walk, choose between fetch and soccer and to reward the dog with the last corner of your sandwich. But C.T. and Wren thought you'd want to know of these examples...</p>
<p><strong>Success stories in Value-Based Consensus include:</strong></p>
<p>•The Tulsa Symphony Orchestra. Solved a intractable union dispute by adopting C.T.'s model. Now the musicians are in management and they're getting great reviews.</p>
<p>•The Alaskan Native Health Board. Used C.T.'s model to dismantle the government's ""divide and conquer"" stragegy. Now they are in charge of their own health care system and hundreds of millions of their tax dollars have been returned to them for health care. This success story is being spread to other First Nations groups around the world.</p>
<p>•Grand Travers County Land Use and Transportation Study. The county around Travers City, Michigan used C.T.'s model to create a land use plan with massive citizen input and decisionmaking.</p>
<p>•ACT UP. C.T. facilitated a national conference call using consensus to design a way to equitably distribute $1.5M between 80 ACT UP local chapters.</p>
<p>•Feminist GA; Occupy Redux. Occupy activists in New York and Philadelphia are ""recircling the wagons,"" organizing Value-Based Consensus affinity groups and calling for a reorganizing of the Occupy structure to create safer space and real accountability, so all voices can truly be heard!</p>

Hippie Chick Diaries writer Wren Tuatha is a 17 year veteran of the intentional communities movement. She's been an alternative educator for 30 years. Her activism has included campaigning for the Equal Rights Amendment, GLBT rights, animal rights, no nukes and the Worthy Wage Campaign. She developed and directed the consensus-based Open Classroom homeschooling program at Heathcote Community.
Here's Mama Wren posting about me and my stroller: http://hippiechickdiaries.com/2012/04/17/discov...
Tuatha Guinan is and eleven year old sheltie to teaches Wren and C.T. everything about group dynamics through the mediums of ball games and puppy piles. He is convinced that squirrels are tools of the state that throw things at him. He believes the social divide between dogs and cats has gone beyond what simple conflict resolution techniques can fix. Most of his activism has centered around access for dogs in public places, known as the, ""get to go, get to go!"" campaign. When thunder happens, Tuatha becomes the super hero Dragon Boy by donning a costume with some assistance.
Since October of 2011, Fiopa has been touring America, offering workshops in consensus, facilitation, non-violence, intentional community, agenda planning, minutes taking, how to start a Food Not Bombs, etc., to Occupy groups. We held 6 weekend workshops and dozens of shorter teach-ins in 15 Occupy cities, including:

Baltimore, MD Boston, MA Philadelphia, PA New York, NY Chico, CA San Francisco, CA Berkeley, CA Oakland, CA Louisville, KY Lexington, KY Charleston, WV York, PA

I teach Wren and C.T. and they teach others. I don't like the subway, even though I have a stroller, so I guard Serenity. Now we're taking our momentum to other groups. We continue to get requests from activists, communitarians and organizers for our deepened trainings in places are far flung as:

OWS/New York, NY Philadelphia, PA Denver, CO Boulder, CO Dallas/Ft. Worth, TX Atlanta, GA Louisville, KY Seattle, WA Asheville, NC Orlando, FL

THAT'S A LOT OF MILES! WE MUST KEEP OUR HOME ON THE ROAD TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE!
Everyone attends meetings. Humans have the idea that they're a necessary evil. But we are teaching a form of direct democracy that eclipses voting, where all voices truly are heard, and the group learns how to handle dominating personalities while making decisions that have everyone's buy-in.
HELP US KEEP SPREADING THESE SKILLS!
What We're Asking and Offering
Our 1986 34-foot Fleetwood Bounder, ""Serenity,"" is our home, office and transportation. It is a secure place where Mama can keep me safe and it makes our travels consistent, relaxing and possible. But it's an old truck and needs the following repairs to pass Maryland State Inspection, get registered and to be safe while we drive:

Update: Since we made this breakdown, we've learned from the inspectors that our total will actually be about $3400.
Any money donated will be applied toward RV repairs. If we exceed our goal, additional money will be held in reserve for future maintenence and repairs.
Perks:
Any donation you can make is greatly appreciated! $5 is $5! Here is what we are offering at specific giving levels:
• $25 A pewter dragon necklace, pewter frog necklace or a FNB t-shirt.
• $30 A pewter unicorn necklace, pewter Zuni fetish bear necklace or a batik blue fairy flag
• $35 A batik crystal dragon pennant
• $50 An autographed copy of On Conflict and Consensus. Keep it or gift it!
• $100 An autographed copy of On Conflict and Consensus and Consensus for Cities!
• $120 A string set of 6 batik cat goddess flags
• $250 Dinner with C.T. and Wren!
• $1000 A week on tour in Serenity!
OR
•Substitute any perk above for a guest post on Hippie Chick Diaries---What would you like to say to the HCD audience? Perhaps you or your pet have some ideas to share with the world!
Together We Are Making a Difference
Early in their adult lives, C.T. was a theater producer and Wren went to film school for screenwriting. And I was studying to be a couch tester. We diverted from our paths, not because we changed our desires, but because, through our activism, we learned that social technologies like Value-Based Consensus, creative conflict resolution, Non-Violent Communication, ZEGG Forum, etc., were the structural keys to changing the world. The visions of how to make things better are all great---Permaculture, natural building, dog parks, bike co-ops, community gardens, direct action, etc. But whether these social change strategies succeed or fail is determined by how we talk, listen to each other and how we create buy-in.
AND WE WANT THE GREAT IDEAS PEOPLE ARE COMING UP WITH TO SUCCEED!
So we must stay on the road, teaching these skills. These cooperative concepts not taught in schools or obedience classes. Can you help? We have the experience, and our pedagogy is blossoming in exciting ways. Will you help get us down the road?
I teach that the best use of consensus is to decide to take a nap, go for a walk, choose between fetch and soccer and to reward the dog with the last corner of your sandwich. But C.T. and Wren thought you'd want to know of these examples...
Success stories in Value-Based Consensus include:
•The Tulsa Symphony Orchestra. Solved a intractable union dispute by adopting C.T.'s model. Now the musicians are in management and they're getting great reviews.
•The Alaskan Native Health Board. Used C.T.'s model to dismantle the government's ""divide and conquer"" stragegy. Now they are in charge of their own health care system and hundreds of millions of their tax dollars have been returned to them for health care. This success story is being spread to other First Nations groups around the world.
•Grand Travers County Land Use and Transportation Study. The county around Travers City, Michigan used C.T.'s model to create a land use plan with massive citizen input and decisionmaking.
•ACT UP. C.T. facilitated a national conference call using consensus to design a way to equitably distribute $1.5M between 80 ACT UP local chapters.
•Feminist GA; Occupy Redux. Occupy activists in New York and Philadelphia are ""recircling the wagons,"" organizing Value-Based Consensus affinity groups and calling for a reorganizing of the Occupy structure to create safer space and real accountability, so all voices can truly be heard!

<p><strong>Thanks, </strong></p>

<p><strong>THANK-YOU TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS SUPPORTED THIS CAMPAIGN!! </strong></p>
<p><strong>The following material and the video above are from the recent campaign to fund the last draft. ""like"" the facebook page and stay tuned!</strong></p>
<p><strong>This campaign allows you to get involved in an international, collaborative exchange on this exciting novel!</strong></p>
<p><em>Für Information auf Deutsch siehe Dokument “Deutsch” unter dem Reiter „Gallery“. (oben rechts)</em></p>
<p>SAVE BOB is a short novel set in the suburbs of New Zealand in the near future. The story is told from the perspective of Bob, a regular guy experiencing the changes in his suburban world as cheap oil runs out. SAVE BOB traces the protagonist’s comical attempts to change his life in order to cope with the global energy crisis. In the style of a great whodunit, Bob wakes up in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor and tries to piece back together the events leading up to his predicament.</p>
<p>The end goal of this story is to give a broader audience a realistic picture of life in the suburbs in the very near future. This project is about creating a rocking short novel - ideal for being transposed to other entertainment formats.</p>
<p><strong>WHO WE ARE:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author</strong></p>
<p>My name is Carrie Hampel and SAVE BOB is my first novel. Working in the creative arts and entertainment industries for more than 20 years, I have written a number of short stories, performances, and songs that I have produced and performed in Berlin. In many ways I am a true freelancer – in every sense of the word – in that I have worked as an actor and entertainer in many different forms from circuses to stand-up, prime time national German TV, to films and performance art in Auckland, Melbourne, New York, London, and Berlin. Basically, I know what makes an audience tick. Since becoming a mother and working on this novel, I have also worked as a translator and language editor. SAVE BOB will be the first piece of creative writing I aim to get published.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator </strong></p>
<p>My friend and assistant, Leah Matthews, is helping me to get this project off the ground. Having completed a Bachelor and Master’s degree in literature in Australia and Germany, she will assist me in editing and coordinating the final draft of the novel before it is sent off to publishers or published online.</p>
<p><strong>Mentor</strong></p>
<p>My mentor, Atillio Pigneri has a doctorate in Energy Systems and Environment at Università degli Studi di Lecce. Attilio’s experience and passionate involvement in numerous organisations, institutes and universities around the world are too lengthy to list here. Suffice it to say he has over ten years’ experience in interdisciplinary scholarship on energy and environmental issues, incorporating engineering, economics, public policy, and environmental science. Attilio has mentored this project from the beginning (2005) and makes sure the novel reflects scientific fact. He has also coached me in the methods and mechanisms of creating a solid and multifaceted future scenario.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>THE CONCEPT:</strong></p>
<p>The idea of SAVE BOB dates back to 2005 when I was living in the suburbs of Auckland. I found myself stuck without a car and had no access to reliable public transport. During this time it struck me that oil wont last forever. I started asking myself: What would happen to the area I was living in when oil ran out? These questions coupled with some initial research into global oil supplies inspired me to write a short novel - a near future scenario in the suburbs as oil becomes expensive before finally running out.  SAVE BOB provides a very likely prognosis for suburban life based on, and supported by, research from industry as well as academic channels. The research for the novel dates back to 2005 and includes expert interviews, industry statistics and local research.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THIS CREATIVE PROCESS INVOLVES YOU!</strong></p>
<p>This crowdfunding campaign and your support will help me to complete the last draft. Once this has been written, I will offer a series of live online readings in both German and English for different time zones. During the online reading I will be able to address you personally, and you will be able to ask questions and give feedback on the excerpts. I hope and plan to incorporate your feedback and comments in any subsequent corrections and rewrites before the novel is published.  </p>
<p><strong>GOAL:</strong></p>
<p>The funds generated through this campaign will enable me to write the final draft of SAVE BOB. Specifically the money will be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide me with a wage for a three-month period to write the final draft.</li>
<li>Give me chance to work with other people on the text, themes and ideas.</li>
<li>Perform online live readings of the material and integrate your feedback and ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I receive more than my stated goal of USD 5 000, funds will go towards a trip to Australia and New Zealand for researching and fine-tuning details relating to setting and characters. Moreover, I plan to use the campaign to create awareness of the themes addressed in the book.</p>
<p>If I do not reach my goal of USD 5 000, I will use all received funds to work for long as I can on the novel.<strong> </strong></p>

You are invited to taste living wine, immerse in the truth of a love so profound, that you are filled and on fire for what can turn our own and the world around.


What inspires people to care
for the environment, to put their lives on the line for those, whose human
rights don't even exist, to create works of magnificence and beauty, be kissed
in wild abandon and reach a hand across the chasm of different worlds to truly connect? Love. Here. In
each of us, and alive between the stars. A gift, beckoning us to come home
and cultivate our soil for real love to grow. Spreading far and wide, inspiring
lives. One heart, one book at a time.
This book is a unique symphony
of true life adventure, poetic stories, practical skill and ancient wisdom
woven together to ignite a blazing fire- a revolution that awakens lives,
touches hearts and changes the world. I send a kiss across the universe
to you for being part of it.
What has love got to do with
rich bread and dark chocolate, your toes and simply breathing, the business of actual relating with each other and being present with a child, to tend to trees and rivers, connect with animals and roar like a lioness for what we value at the core? What’s
love got to do with daring to be vulnerable and reach through the deep dark to bring forth what is
true, healing all too familiar heartbreaks and aches, embracing joy and pain,
dropping into stillness and intimacy with all of life, turning on awareness and falling free into love all over,
engaging with social justice and my neighbor next door? Everything. I have not
met a single being, who does not want to be seen, heard and loved.
What is in it? (For excerpts please scroll below the picture.)
'Kissed
by Fire’ is a flesh-and-blood book on real love, how to discover and grow it in
ourselves, with nature and between each other. It is empowering us to truly live this love- simple and outrageous, with all our human stumbling- wherever we are, whatever is going on. Written
with mind, belly, feeling and soul, it engages, educates, touches our deepest being, and
inspires us toward a greater calling. One that can cause a dam to open and the world to turn- with the wonderous gift of you. 

A little about myself:  
I am putting my naked heart
unto the street with this book, feel vulnerable to bring it forth, exited,
unnerved and it's plain awkward to promote it too. But that's how it is with
love. It just takes courage to be open and real. What to do, when on fire for
true loving, in a world where we could do with much more of it? I worked
for over a decade in the field of teaching, healing and leading people, and
have been walking this path myself, through the trenches and glories. I felt
called to write a book that was in the making and baking for an entire
lifetime- and still is.

What is the funding needed for:
Even though the title is not
yet set in stone, the book is written with 350 pages and is getting ready to come out.
I have poured every cent, time, energy and my whole heart into a labor of love, for what I believe is an important contribution to humanity and the planet.  Funding is needed
for an editor, proof reader, designer, agent to deliver substantial quality and get into a publishing house to show up in bookstores, in your hands and to turn lives.
What you receive:
Wonderful perks to choose
from. This book for your own life. To grow and spread love by making the
book happen. Be part of a movement that is benefitting the planet and people. With your contribution you are helping a book to come forth, that will help many other
beings.

Thank you for supporting ""Kissed by Fire"". With you it will be
published, can turn and inspire lives, and change our world- one heart, one book at a time. Forward the campaign to friends, write a
comment on this site, pledge monies, make some noise and spread the news about this
book! Every act of love matters. You make a difference with a contribution.Thank
you with all my heart!

Tastes of the Book

From 'A deeper
calling"": 
Do you hear the whisper, the stirring when life is emerging
as the first daffodil, when the tiny chirpings of birds tickle you to smile; or
the moment, when all is still and suddenly shattering thunder and lightening
pierces the sky? In the middle of the night, when alone twisting and turning,
there is a restlessness that nothing seems to satisfy, no matter how hard you
may have tried to tie it down. Or looking out across the ocean over the
horizon, and a longing, an ache is arising, as if from an ancient knowing wanting
to awaken in you...
From the 'Loving humanity'
chapter: 
Glorious. Bloody. Humanity. Centuries interwoven with times of
peace and war, terror inflicted and happiness shared, threads of beauty shining
through, and toxins spilled upon the carpet of life, works of geniuses and the
greatness of the human spirit follow us through all the ages. The color of
insanity is close by, horrible and beneficial deeds stand out; we are born and
die over and over again. The fabric of humanity is a mighty one, an epic played
out, that still continues on- to this day. The story is alive in our cells and
bones.Where does love come in?...
 ...A little 5
year-old girl in the orphanage where I worked offered Mother Teresa her only
toy to take to the children in the slums. I could see how precious this ragged,
cuddled up and tear stained doll was to her, and yet she was beaming to be able
to offer her gift. Mother Teresa did not want people to give from their
abundance, what they did not need, or a leftover. What matters, she always
said, is how much love we put into the giving. That is where true joy is
found. She lived what she spoke; I saw it in her eyes and in the way she held the hand of the old thin man, who was dying in peace. 
From the 'Relationship
Cookbook':  
""Is your kitchen a welcoming place?"" I asked a
friend, to which he replied: “What in the world are you talking about? What
have kitchens, bread, chocolate to do with relationships and love?”(I would
include chilli too). Well, everything really. What ingredients do you have in
your kitchen that nourish and grow healthy relationships? Sometimes we have
rotten food in our refrigerator or jars of poison that might need to be emptied
out. What could use a dose of refilling in your storage house? Appreciation is
one, that comes in handy to be able to offer daily food for any
relationship. 
From 'Essential
communication for all seasons': 
Simple and real the heart always hits the
mark. What is fresh and alive for you? What is true and here between us, right
now? The invitation is to enter into another world with curiosity, to get to
know the different landscape of another and let our own world be seen, without
the usual judgment screen. This is a worthwhile practice that can connect us
across the abyss of misunderstanding and the walls we tend to build, when we shut down.
From the 'Truth
breaks through' chapter:
...She looked panicked, kept turning around to see if
someone could hear her and then drew me into the back, the dark corner of my
favourite chai and coffee store. In a husky voice the woman, who worked for
him, spoke: “I must not be seen or heard, you must not use my name. It could
cost my life.” I leaned in closer to listen: ”You are about to grasp the velvet
glove of a vampire. Get the hell out.Now.“ My hairs went up, I literally had
fallen into one of those thriller Hollywood movies I thought I never watch. I
was in big time trouble with finances, a castle and my life at stake. Would the
power of truth be enough to find a way to victory? 
From the 'The Kiss and the Gold' chapter: 
""She kissed my forehead with a gentle touch and lightening struck all the way through. My life, as I had known it, was over.. .
..Love is like a fire, burning everything that is untrue, without escape. In
the final surrender, as nothing is left, the deepest yearning is fulfilled. You are the flame."" 
From 'Relating with
Nature': 
The eye of this magnificent whale carried stillness from the deepest
place in the sea and ancient wisdom from the earth was woven in her song. It
was otherworldly and profound to hear, piercing each of us to tears. What
could we do for the ocean and her kind, given the situation the environment is
in? As I reached with my hands to touch the humpback whale mother, I told her
that I would help however I could. 
From the introduction
chapter 'Power of real love': 
Can we allow our hearts to be broken open, be as
wide as the world in answer to this? Greatness emerges, as we dare to be
present and open in the midst of the beauty and the horror of our humanness. I have
seen it over and over again: when people feel connected, they care and act. They naturally love.
End of Excerpts. For now.
I am grateful for Indiegogo. It offers a platform for
creativity, pioneering and odd artists like myself and a book such as this one
here, that intends to inspire and turn the world around. A little much, hm? It
can happen for one person and spread on from there. One drop is sometimes
enough to cause a dam to break.
My book came ananounced
and unplanned, as often creative projects- and in fact babies- do. It emerged
from thirty years of my work with people and my own, rather epic life. Many a
time I have been asked to write what I have found in the darkest time when all was taken, and what I have been passionatley living- with all
the glories and agonies. 
A love that is universal and intimate, burning through the  delusions we tend to carry around, connecting us for real and which makes a powerful difference in the world; no matter what country,
belief and background people come from.
I have been writing
(in scribbles), before I could walk, but this is officially my first 'proper' book. I have written a book of poems that has been selling in the local market and other little booklets, some landed in peoples hands, but a lot I kept away from the public eye. Even
though I am shaking in my boots, I feel this one is deserving to venture out
from my paper filled closets to a publishing house.  Why? Because this book is about what most
people want in their life, are fulfilled, inspired and moved to action by.
Real Love.
And I am on fire to awaken hearts and changing the world, one book at a
time. Written for the sake of the people, this beautiful earth, and you.
Thank you for offering your special gift to it!

<p>Yep, “Thank you” is what I thought I was
supposed to say, when told I didn’t “look Jewish.” Unbelievable, eh?</p>
<p>What will make it irresistible for Jewish
women to free ourselves of ways we’ve been (unconsciously) taught to feel, deep
inside, that there is something wrong with us? It’s what I call internalized
anti-Semitism, also internalized sexism. My new book – <b><i>Hope into Practice, Jewish women choosing
justice despite our fears</i></b> -- responds with a juicy blend of healing
stories, fascinating history, and also a fair-minded perspective on
Israel-Palestine—asking us to love ourselves enough to have the courage to face
our Jewish fears, without acting on them. </p>
<p>An activist’s call to repair the world, <b><i>Hope
into Practice</i></b> is anchored in Jewish ethical tradition and community. AND
to help it be most useful, I’ve included <i>an
action-oriented Reader’s Guide, </i>for groups and individuals. For nearly six years,
I’ve been birthing this book and I’m so excited to get it out there! <i>Scroll down to read some eloquent
testimonials…</i></p>
<p><b><i>What’s in it for You!</i></b></p>
<p>Life experience has taught me that the better
we feel about who we are and where we come from, the better we’ll treat other
people -- and the more positive/powerful our activism will be in creating a

joyful, expansive and meaningful our own lives will be. That’s the bottom line
of <i>Hope into Practice</i>, and why I want

name it. </p>
<p><i>Hope into Practice </i>is <i>about </i>Jewish women in the U.S., but it’s

<p><b><i>Funds to Raise</i></b></p>
<p>I want to raise $7500 to fund airfare for a
bunch of mini-book-tours all over the country this year, from New York to Ohio,
North Carolina to San Diego, Michigan to Seattle. Because of my job
commitments, I can’t take one big chunk of time to do this, so I’ll schedule week-long
tour-lets throughout the year. Based on fares for recent flights I’ve taken,
$7500 is my best guess for overall expenses, including rental cars, meals, and
motels when I can’t find community housing. I need to raise this by OCTOBER 15, so hope you can help -- and if I raise more, I’ll use those funds to print
more books. (For my last 2 books, I organized 30-city book tours across many states, so I know I
can make this happen!)</p>

<p><b><i>What some amazing folks have said about </i></b><b>Hope into

<p><i>A </i><i>wonderful, gutsy, and inspiring book. </i><i>Penny
Rosenwasser takes on the most explosive issues in American Jewish life
today—racism and anti-Semitism, victimization and privilege, and Jewish
politics around Israel and Palestine—and she does it with a generosity of
spirit and a clear head. </i><i>A vision of a progressive Jewishness for a multicultural 21<sup>st</sup>
century comes through proud and clear. </i>–<b>Karen
Brodkin, author of <i>How Jews Became White
Folks and What That Says About Race in America</i></b></p>
<p><i>This is a book about liberation from our narrow places and the power to
change the world.</i><span>  </span><i>No matter who you are, you’ll learn
something new about being human.</i>–<b>Noah T. Winer, Co-founder, MoveOn.org; Board member,
Jewish Voice for Peace </b></p>
<p><i>A powerful tool for today's Jewish activists. Based on the bold
assumption that communal and individual healing is integral to justice
work, Rosenwasser's multi-disciplinary book is written from a poignant,
personal perspective. </i>Hope into Practice<i> allows readers to reflect on their own
struggles with Jewish identity, queerness, and ethical commitment in order to
imagine a better future. A must-read for all Jewish feminists!</i>–<b>Alainya Kavaloski, Jewish Caucus Chair, National

<p>*  Invites us to reframe internalized voices that tell Jewish women we are Too Much or Not Enough, that no one wants us, that it's dangerous to be visible, that we can't trust anyone, that we are the Lone Ranger, that we have to appear tough, that the whole world is really against Jews<b>.</b></p>
<b>
</b>
<p><span>* <span> </span></span>Insists on the centrality
of Jewish multiculturalism, meaning full inclusion of Jews of color, Mizrahi
and Sephardic Jews, and Jews of other ethnicities and hyphenated identities</p>

healing, bringing our bodies and whole selves into the act, on healing trauma
and rebuilding aliveness</p>
<p>*  Advocates for changing unfair systems, including in the US, including US policies regarding Israel-Palestine; it calls for security, equality, dignity, self-determination and full human rights for Israelis and Palestinians</p>
<p>* Shines a light on Jewish resistance struggles and on our allies, and asks us for the courage to face our fears without acting on them -- to choose justice despite our fears -- linking personal healing with <i>tikkun olam</i>, or mending the world.<br/></p>

for Peace. For many years I was a
performing folk musician, and later a community radio (KPFA) host and producer. I also
belong to Kehilla Synagogue in Oakland, California, and I teach an Anti-Semitism/ Anti-Arabism
class with a Palestinian colleague at the City College of San Francisco. 
What some amazing folks have said about Hope into
Practice…
A wonderful, gutsy, and inspiring book. Penny
Rosenwasser takes on the most explosive issues in American Jewish life
today—racism and anti-Semitism, victimization and privilege, and Jewish
politics around Israel and Palestine—and she does it with a generosity of
spirit and a clear head. A vision of a progressive Jewishness for a multicultural 21st
century comes through proud and clear. –Karen
Brodkin, author of How Jews Became White
Folks and What That Says About Race in America
This is a book about liberation from our narrow places and the power to
change the world.  No matter who you are, you’ll learn
something new about being human.–Noah T. Winer, Co-founder, MoveOn.org; Board member,
Jewish Voice for Peace 
A powerful tool for today's Jewish activists. Based on the bold
assumption that communal and individual healing is integral to justice
work, Rosenwasser's multi-disciplinary book is written from a poignant,
personal perspective. Hope into Practice allows readers to reflect on their own
struggles with Jewish identity, queerness, and ethical commitment in order to
imagine a better future. A must-read for all Jewish feminists!–Alainya Kavaloski, Jewish Caucus Chair, National
Women’s Studies Association
A teaching story for all of us.–Akaya Windwood, President, Rockwood Leadership
Institute
Hope Into Practice acknowledges that we cannot wait to heal all our wounds before we can
act–but cannot wait until our
movements are successful before we turn to our healing.–Marjorie Dove Kent, Executive Director, Jews for Racial & Economic
Justice 


And finally, just so you know, Hope
into Practice…
*  Reclaims a loud-proud (not
superior) joyful Jewishness
*  Invites us to reframe internalized voices that tell Jewish women we are Too Much or Not Enough, that no one wants us, that it's dangerous to be visible, that we can't trust anyone, that we are the Lone Ranger, that we have to appear tough, that the whole world is really against Jews.


*  Insists on the centrality
of Jewish multiculturalism, meaning full inclusion of Jews of color, Mizrahi
and Sephardic Jews, and Jews of other ethnicities and hyphenated identities
*  Calls for liberatory
healing, bringing our bodies and whole selves into the act, on healing trauma
and rebuilding aliveness
*  Advocates for changing unfair systems, including in the US, including US policies regarding Israel-Palestine; it calls for security, equality, dignity, self-determination and full human rights for Israelis and Palestinians
* Shines a light on Jewish resistance struggles and on our allies, and asks us for the courage to face our fears without acting on them -- to choose justice despite our fears -- linking personal healing with tikkun olam, or mending the world.

<p><strong>When I was a little girl, I wanted to be a writer.</strong> That was my inner most dream.  What did you want to be? This simple question stops people.  It makes them think.  It stirs up emotion.  Thought.  Memory.  Passion. Disappointment.  Acceptance. <br/><br/><strong>For the last 8 years, I have helped people to find dream jobs in the NYC fashion &amp; media world. </strong> I listen, coach, critique, and support.   I help people chase their dreams and embrace reality at the same time. I can relate as I had a career in fashion after trying to work in beauty. I wanted to be a newscaster.  I wanted to be a billion things.  And here I am, a recruiter.  <br/><br/>Its not always easy.  When the economy was tough,  I heard so many stories.  I didn't want my candidates to give up just because the professional world had come to a pause.  I didn't want to give up because I had a little girl at home who missed me when I went to work.  <strong>The juxtaposition of going to work every day and struggling to help people and coming home and looking into those hopeful and bright eyes brought my pen to paper.  How could I explain what I do to my daughter? </strong> How could I teach her to never give up?  How could I encourage her to chase her dreams? My gut instinct reminded me that I was far from the only parent wanting to explain ""work and choice and perserverance"" to my child.  <br/><br/><strong>Memorial Day Weekend 2011-I was delayed at O'Hare airport for literally 8 hours and I sat down and wrote about Rosie wanting to be a fireman.</strong>  In the 2 years since I wrote a simple but meaningful story while waiting for my flight to Newark:  I had a second daughter, watched my beautiful mother beat breast cancer, became an Aunt, and grew my division of our family's staffing firm (Choice Fashion) tremendously.  Busy was putting it kindly.   Yet, I never gave up on the dream of getting this book out there and into the hands of my peers...my fellow parents who want to read something super relevant at bedtime. <br/><br/><strong>By supporting my efforts,  I hope to publish not only this book, but a series of books all about different careers.  Why not?</strong>  It just makes so much sense- as ""they"" say, I can write what I know and help others while doing it. I have charities I would love to give back to, big plans, big dreams.  </p>
<p>I hope that you too can use Rosie to teach a great lesson in your own home.  She will start a dialogue.  One that is ageless.  And timeless.  Because you know what?  Even though I am a mom and run a business and have all of this serious day to day grown up stuff to swallow..<strong>.I always wanted to be a writer.  And now, I can add that title to my resume.</strong>  Writing Rosie proves that I practice what I preach day in and day out. Dreaming big is not always easy, but it is certainly always worth it.  <br/><br/>My staff knows my ""Marissa'isms"" inside and out.  One of my favorites applies to Rosie and I expect to happen once I click ""upload"" to this Indiegogo profile (eek!)- <strong>Success redefines itself every single day.</strong>  <strong>What feels right today, may not feel right tomorrow and visa versa</strong>.  Rosie can be the next Must HAVE book for anyone who is anyone under the age of 6 or Rosie may just be a beautiful little story that I wrote for my daughter and for your daughters/sons.  I love either storyline, however you define it.  <br/><br/>To learn more about my day job, please visit <a href=""http://www.choicecofashion.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Choice Fashion"">www.choicecofashion.com.</a> To learn more about my incredibly talented illustrator, Brooke Hagel, please check out her <a href=""http://www.fabulousdoodles.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Fabulous Doodles by Brooke Hagel"">www.fabulousdoodles.blogspot.com</a>.

<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Nhat Crawford</strong>, the author of <em><strong>Black Coffee One Sugar</strong></em>. Eight years ago I began putting a real to life story into a novel called <em>Black Coffee One Sugar</em>. It was created on the heels of my first book entitled <em><strong>Love Braid Us Three</strong></em>, a book that many readers enjoyed and were quite moved by. Naturally, everyone wanted to know if I’d be writing a sequel or at least another book. My answer was, Yes! Instead, however, as life would have it, I suffered a divorce and magnanimous loss, which landed me in the poorhouse first then the hospital several times, then nearly in the grave. Thank God I was spared! </p>
<p><em><strong>Black Coffee</strong></em> is the first in a trilogy about Ian Maximus Yarborough, the head of a successful business and a family who adores him. To his daughter, Teenah, he is idylic. However, when one flawed decision of his causes their family and business to become striped of everything, Teenah is left to wade through taunting nightmares, questions and her own personal lusts. Weak for the fight, she and her family battle murderous enemies that have been awaiting the Yarboroughs for decades, all without Mr. Yarborough.</p>
<p>I need your help to pay for printing, editing, graphics, formatting, television adaptation, shipping and distribution. </p>
<p>Please help me get it out and onto your Ereaders or into your hands. You won’t believe this book is based on actual events.</p>

It’s a complicated process which often causes feelings of confusion, doubt, guilt, shame, excitement, fear, relief and anxiety.The Coming Out is a collaborative project. It’s a collection of coming out stories, real life coming out stories from gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans-gender people. The goal of The Coming Out is to inspire, support and unite those who are living their lives either completely, or partially in the closet. The purpose of the book is not to encourage people to come out before they are ready, but rather to expose them to first hand accounts from people who have already been through, and are still going through the process themselves.Where will the stories come from? They’ll come from you. We want you to share your coming out story. Any gender, identity or sexuality. Happy, sad, serious, successful, funny or however. We want you to share your own experience.To produce the book, we need approximately $8,000. The funds raised will go to cover the cost of:

Content Curating


Book Trailer Cinematography 


Custom Cover


ISBN Assignment


Worldwide Book Distribution


Book Design and Page Layout


Custom Interior Design


Digital Formatting and Distribution

The profits from the book are going to support an LGBT Organization. The profits will be donated to the Human Rights Campaign, which is America’s largest civil rights organization working to achieve lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality. If you can't financially contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help:

<p>My name is John Kelepouris and i'm from Greece. Three years now after the economic crisis hit Greece i'm unemployed and with so much free time in my hands i started writing a fantasy novel that i first thought while i was working at a sleep apnea company. While i was working there not only i found out a lot about the facts of sleeping but also i came across with the myth of Hypnos god of sleep. So the idea started forming itself until one summer three years ago, as i was unemployed, i started writing.</p>
<p>I finally managed to come to an end and right now i'm writing the final chapter of my first novel titled <strong>""Dreamers"".</strong> It's going to be approximately 350 pages and it's a fantasy novel written in greek and this campaign is to raise money so i can self publish this book.</p>
<p>You can take a look about the plot here:<a href=""http://dreamersthebook.wordpress.com/about/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://dreamersthebook.wordpress.com/about/about/</a></p>
<p>This fund raising will not only help me raise money for the publishing but also for the site construction where i'll be selling my novel. I'm also trying to find an experienced translator so i can sell it to a broader range of readers. It will also help me pay for an editor and marketing services.</p>
<p>If all goes well i will be ready to publish about 200 copies of it by the end of this year and sell it via internet and various bookstores here in Greece.</p>
<p>So if you are interested to see my first novel published and read it for yourselves help me in this campaign.</p>
<p>The funding goal is 5000 euros as i am not sure yet how much all of this will cost.</p>
<p>To get the copyright for my book i will be needing about 100 euros. For the site construction i think i will need about 500-1000 euros for a site that will allow me to sell via internet. Finding an editor might cost me 500 euros more or less. The publishing of 200 copies of a book of approximately 350 pages will cost me about 1500-2000 euros. Marketing services will be cheaper since there are a lot of ways (facebook, blog) to make my book known, but i will be needing someone who can really make this work at least here in Greece. So let's say he'll get another 500euros for a small campaign (book presentation, advertising etc).</p>
<p>So that's about it. I think 5000 euros is an appropriate amount and if it costs less it's going to help me publish more than 200 copies. If i don't reach the 5000euros goal than i will try to find cheap solutions for this project to be complete.</p>
<p>I'm sure that if you read the plot you'll want to see it published. I'm only thinking that it's such a great story that it would be best if someone like Neil Gaiman or Clive Barker should have written it to be the best story ever... But it's just me and this is my first book and i really tried hard on it. I hope someday you'll read it and enjoy it!</p>
<p>As the author of a fantasy novel titled <strong>""</strong><strong>Dreamers"" </strong>i'm sure you understand i too i'm a dreamer. My dream is written in this book and it's about all of us getting better not only as individuals but as a species. I hope this book help people to understand that all that matters is that we don't need to be afraid of death, to have hope in our hearts and to dream about a better future for all of us and try to make it happen.</p>
<p>I know it sounds romantic but dreamers are...</p>
<p>So if you like to donate, please do. If you are willing to help me otherwise, you already know that i will need a translator, an editor, an advertizer, a site builder or even a manager and so on and so forth, so if you can help me this way you are welcome!</p>
<p>Thank you in advance and thanks Indiegogo for the conviences that offers like it's sharing tools which you can use to make this project succeed</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p>Our Design Challenge: Learning to Create and Build Your Own Way through Life’s Obstacles, Struggles and Traumas<br/><br/>My name is Rick Prater and I am the author of Our Design Challenge. I wrote this book because wanted to share an attainable, livable way to face life’s challenges.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your own Mindset. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the Design Mindset with you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you Design the Life you want to live.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the Design Mindset and overcoming Life's Roadblocks.</p>
<p>Do Designers utilize their Mindset to ideate, model, evaluate and create a world different from the one they live in? What came first the Mindset or the Creation? - Meet Renowned Architect Peter Marino, the Maestro of Luxury. He’s the secret ingredient behind the unique flagship stores of Chanel, Dior and Louis Vuitton. Architectural Curator is the label coined to describe Peter’s unique mash-up of Art and Design. Mash-up indeed. Somehow, the worldly, wonderfully sophisticated label mashes and smashes the real image of a man from humble working-class Flushing Meadows roots and the real origins of Peter’s love of the Arts. Peter started his life trapped in his bedroom by a childhood illness with drawing or prototyping another world as his means of living a life outside his bedroom.</p>
<p>Interested in AI or Robotic Design, then you love learning how Improv has Infused Design’s use of Human Prototyping - For Product Designer Bryan Cooperridge – an Improv Mindset is a Design Mindset. What? Here’s the scoop. Bryan actually studied Improvisation Acting before Design and for him this link is unbreakable. Some background information, Bryan is an educator, designer, and Improv Actor with a masters in product design from Stanford University. He’s the go-to-guy on how to apply Improv to Design Prototyping.</p>
<p>Does a Human Centered Design Mindset help create tangible Business success - Yes. AirBnB was founded by a group of Industrial Designers, here’s learn what Joe Gebbia thinks about that out-of-the-box journey- “Airbnb didn’t have five- or 10-year metrics at day zero, we just focused on building something we thought could help solve a problem, while bringing people closer together,”</p>
<p>You will love this book if you want to expand your life, and map out a new journey for your life or career.<br/><br/>Our Design Challenge is a non-fiction book that speaks to anyone who needs to overcome a life challenge and anyone who loves a good career challenge. It’s for the person looking for personal agency and the how to of a design mindset for the first time.</p>
<h2>The Book - Our Design Challenge</h2>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>The BE Part contains an introduction with three additional chapters. This section is designed to show how Human Centered Design benefits from be honestly and authentically - traits we all have but sometimes need to activate or use differently. You’ll learn how Peter Marino’s traumatic childhood illness transformed his mindset and how he still benefits and is grateful for the experience.<br/><br/>The DO Part also contains three Chapters. We’ll work on recognizing, enhancing, and owning the traits of Authenticity, Empathy and Intentionality all prime traits of a great Design Mindset.<br/><br/>The HAVE Part and it’s Five Chapters outlines Challenge we all face, Our Design Challenge and how we can create a mindset to achieve the life we want. You’ll learn how to develop your mindset and improve your career, relationships and joy.</p>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2020.</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this [season of year]</li>
</ul>
<h2>When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish</li>
<li>A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book</li>
<li>Your Name will appear in a Special, Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)</li>
<li>Early access to the Introduction of my Book and my entire manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback</li>
<li>The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover</li>
<li>I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share experience the experiences of writing my book</li>
<li>And more...</li>
</ul>
<h2>About the Author</h2> Here’s some quote porn, by the Knoll Industrial designer, Harry Bertola that helped light my desire for life when I really needed it: “The urge for good design is the same as the urge to go on living. The assumption is that somewhere, hidden, is a better way of doing things”<br/><br/>Harry’s quote perfectly sums up the way I felt after regaining some clarity thanks to a week in detox.<br/><br/>My story isn’t original or even interesting. Life handed me lemons and I solved the problem by adding Vodka. I reached for a replacement for life and it worked. The replacement gave me broken bones, a few seizures and finally a stroke. Vodka never killed the lemons – by the way.<br/><br/>Now … I’m not suggesting Design is a Superpower able to leap over any 12 Step Program or even a bullet train to success. I’ve learned by living. I know Design Principles are Empathetic, Responsive and have Integrity. And the best way to learn is by sharing. For 7 wonderful years I’ve shared, mentored and trained individuals using basic design principles. I’ve been able to Shine, Refine and Redesign these principles and now I’d love to share them with you. You don’t have to be in Rehab, Hit Rock Bottom or have to redesign your entire life to benefit from these principles. But you will benefit by applying them. This is for anyone that feels stuck by life’s obstacles, struggles or traumas. This is for the person that wants to think outside of the box but needs a map on how to get there.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Rick at Rick@praterdesign.com Instagram: praterdesign , Facebook: rick prater design<p> </p>

We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

This book, which will be published by Chelsea Green, specifically addresses the question of how to reclaim and revive our whole health-care system—from how we care for each other in a community, to how our hospitals will function in the age of dwindling resources—in a connected, loving, and powerful way.

It’s a combination of visually stunning work, story telling and social dynamic study all combined into one. Specifically, this project focuses on all of us passing judgement, making assumptions and outcasting others based only on the surface physical appearances. It’s a one-­of­‐a­‐kind project. Through this project with the help of some very recognizable names and faces we want to remind everyone that we are all just people with same joys, fears, worries, and insecurities. And through that encourage everyone to higher self-‐awareness, building a healthy confidence, self-love and understand that being your true authentic self is the most beautiful thing in the world, because out of self sustaining beauty, springs forth beauty and love for everything else around you hence eliminating discrimination, judgement and bullying.</p>
<p>This project has only one goal. To deliver a message... and hopefully, for everyone involved to have a great time doing it. All on­‐board are very excited about the project and it’s been nothing but pure labor of love from the day this idea was born, since everyone involved is donating their talent and time 100%.</p>

An amazing behind the scenes team and two hands full of recognizable faces and names that agreed to be involved, I am just beside myself!!! It all lined up so perfectly. It's one of those things when you know you're doing something right and things just start falling into place. I just need the last push...to get the book finished, published and out to the world. And spread the message to as many people as possible. </p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE THE FUNDS FOR?</strong></p>
<p>Most of the funds will be used for graphic design, layout, editing, and actual publishing of the book . As I mentioned before this book has one goal in mind, to deliver a message and to make sure we get it out to as many people as possible we are going to need some help. That's why  a portion of the raised funds will be used for publicity and for launch campaign/event. And of course some if it is to cover the perk expenses like shipping etc... </p>

<p>   We have been feeling God’s pressing on our spirit to join Northland on a mission trip for quite some time. With much excitement and answer to prayer, we have the wonderful opportunity to go to Swaziland, Africa for 10 days, June 14-24.  We are thrilled! We will be ministering with a team of about 20 adults from Northland Church. We will be mostly working at the Global Primary School in Siteki, Swaziland.  This includes children’s ministry in the school and construction on teacher housing, along with meeting some agriculture needs of the community, house visits, and even a little soccer with the kids.</p>
<p>   For some context, Swaziland is a country with 1.3 million people and has surpassed Botswana as the country with the world’s highest known HIV/AIDS prevalence.  This is bad news, indeed, but it is also to be seen as an opportunity.  God is at work and has much in store for the people of Swaziland-we get to join Him in serving however He leads.  Pray, pray, pray for the people of Swaziland to see Jesus as the One who can be their Savior.  We too are desperate for God in our daily life. </p>
<p>   In order for us to make this trip, we need to develop a ministry team.  This is a group of people who want to join with us financially and prayerfully.  We need to raise a total of $6,000, which includes our airfare to Swaziland, Africa, transportation within town, lodging, and meals during the 10 days.</p>
<p>   Would you prayerfully consider helping to send our team and us to Africa?  Any amount would be appreciated and thoroughly encouraging.  <em> </em></p>
<p><em>   </em>There are no adequate words to express our gratitude.

<p>We started WhiteHat Magazine because, after working in international news for several years, we started to see a gap between what technology media focused on and what was actually happening in people's lives. Tech media would focus on IPOs, gadget reviews, and the lines out the door to get the latest hot phone, but would rarely look at the conditions of the workers who mined the coltan that goes into that phone, any issues around people being able to access that technology, and how that gadget or software affects the way people interact with each other. </p>
<p>The internet has become a space where the lines of public and private spaces are blurred, and technology itself has created new hierarchies of power. Accordingly, journalism must “[c]over technology as a human rights and political issue as if it were Parliament. […] It is just as interesting and about ten thousand times more important,” said Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, in <a href=""http://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Speech%20-%20Silicon%20Valley%20%26%20Journalism%20-%20Make%20up%20or%20Break%20up_Emily%20Bell_Reuters%20Memorial%20Lecture%202014.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a speech at the University of Oxford</a>. “We have to stop coverage of technology being about queuing for an iPhone and make it about society and power. <b>We need to explain these new systems of power to the world and hold them accountable.</b>”</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">WhiteHat Magazine was founded with the intention of putting humanity back at the center of technology journalism. With that in mind, WhiteHat Magazine's editorial focus covers four broad areas:</span><br/></p> <ul> <li>STEM in global sustainable development</li> <li>Women and minorities in STEM</li> <li>Social entrepreneurship</li>
<li>Global politics and public policy vis-a-vis tech</li> </ul> <p>So what exactly does all that mean? What kind of stories can you expect from us? We have tons of story topics and ideas, so here's just a small sample of some of the stories we are looking at:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Technology in refugee crises: reuniting families, tracking migrations and outbreaks, etc</li>
<li>Analyzing technology and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals</li>
<li>Environmental technology: clean energy, clean oceans, clean air, food and water security</li>
<li>Advancements in health and education</li>
<li>Space: the final frontier</li>
<li>Social media in politics: elections, leadership, protests, and democracy</li>
<li>The global net neutrality debate</li>
<li>The internet &amp; public vs private domains</li>
<li>Internet access &amp; privacy as human rights</li>
<li>Law enforcement and legal systems addressing online crimes/harassment</li>
<li>Diversity in Silicon Valley &amp; positive stories of role models</li>
<li>Global gender gaps in STEM</li>
<li>Video games beyond the 'games': education, conflict management, etc.</li>
<li>Cryptocurrencies and the global unbanked</li>
<li>Digital diplomacy</li>
<li>Impact investing and crowdfunding</li>
<li>Capitalism with a conscience</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Journalism shouldn’t be limited to just one medium anymore. So that’s why we are building a network that will allow us to tell stories on whatever platform fits best. We have already produced the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyAXasOMJlOielB4Ly9awPJOkxdfOyL1F"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2015 Women in STEM Summit</a> in Salt Lake City. Next we will launch the website, <a href=""http://www.whitehatmag.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">whitehatmag.com</a>, and the digital magazine, where you will find longform stories, analysis, and photo essays. After that, we will be expanding into other platforms, like social media streaming, podcasting, video series, native apps, and even creating our own platforms for telling stories in new ways.</p>

<p>‘White hat’ is well-known term in the hacker community—as someone who works with the ‘good guys’. More generally, white hat hackers can be understood as those who break systems in order to make them better. WhiteHat Magazine is named for the efforts to use technology innovations for social good and creating a better world.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Putting Humanity Back at the Center of Tech Journalism WhiteHat Magazine is a digital news organization dedicated to putting humanity back at the center of technology journalism, featuring stories that examine how science and technology innovations change the way we live our lives. 
We started WhiteHat Magazine because, after working in international news for several years, we started to see a gap between what technology media focused on and what was actually happening in people's lives. Tech media would focus on IPOs, gadget reviews, and the lines out the door to get the latest hot phone, but would rarely look at the conditions of the workers who mined the coltan that goes into that phone, any issues around people being able to access that technology, and how that gadget or software affects the way people interact with each other. 
The internet has become a space where the lines of public and private spaces are blurred, and technology itself has created new hierarchies of power. Accordingly, journalism must “[c]over technology as a human rights and political issue as if it were Parliament. […] It is just as interesting and about ten thousand times more important,” said Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, in a speech at the University of Oxford. “We have to stop coverage of technology being about queuing for an iPhone and make it about society and power. We need to explain these new systems of power to the world and hold them accountable.”

WhiteHat Magazine was founded with the intention of putting humanity back at the center of technology journalism. With that in mind, WhiteHat Magazine's editorial focus covers four broad areas:  STEM in global sustainable development Women and minorities in STEM Social entrepreneurship
Global politics and public policy vis-a-vis tech  So what exactly does all that mean? What kind of stories can you expect from us? We have tons of story topics and ideas, so here's just a small sample of some of the stories we are looking at:


Technology in refugee crises: reuniting families, tracking migrations and outbreaks, etc
Analyzing technology and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals
Environmental technology: clean energy, clean oceans, clean air, food and water security
Advancements in health and education
Space: the final frontier
Social media in politics: elections, leadership, protests, and democracy
The global net neutrality debate
The internet & public vs private domains
Internet access & privacy as human rights
Law enforcement and legal systems addressing online crimes/harassment
Diversity in Silicon Valley & positive stories of role models
Global gender gaps in STEM
Video games beyond the 'games': education, conflict management, etc.
Cryptocurrencies and the global unbanked
Digital diplomacy
Impact investing and crowdfunding
Capitalism with a conscience
And more!

Journalism shouldn’t be limited to just one medium anymore. So that’s why we are building a network that will allow us to tell stories on whatever platform fits best. We have already produced the 2015 Women in STEM Summit in Salt Lake City. Next we will launch the website, whitehatmag.com, and the digital magazine, where you will find longform stories, analysis, and photo essays. After that, we will be expanding into other platforms, like social media streaming, podcasting, video series, native apps, and even creating our own platforms for telling stories in new ways.

Want to hear more about us? Editor-in-Chief Chrisella Herzog went on P3 Utah's P3 People Podcast to talk about her vision and inspiration for WhiteHat Magazine! Listen to the full episode here.
   Why ""WhiteHat""?
‘White hat’ is well-known term in the hacker community—as someone who works with the ‘good guys’. More generally, white hat hackers can be understood as those who break systems in order to make them better. WhiteHat Magazine is named for the efforts to use technology innovations for social good and creating a better world.

As part of this campaign, we are opening up our membership community to supporters with extras and discounts included that you won't be able to get after our launch! Check out what these membership levels include:



How the Funds Will be SpentIf we reach our full goal, this is how we plan to spend the money:


Indiegogo Fees: $1000

Shipping & Taxes: $5000

Perks & Printing: $4000

Journalists & Freelancers (For Content): $10,000

Such nice round numbers! The fees, taxes, printing, and shipping costs are estimates, slightly rounded up to give us a bit of padding. If we stay under budget in any area, the extra money will go back into supplies and equipment to make our content even better quality. If you pledge more than our goal of $20,000, we are planning some awesome stretch goals, but that money will go back into hiring more people and getting more great content.

Our focus is creating quality content, and the majority of the funds we raise will be put toward this.

   Risks & Challenges The biggest risk we face in this campaign is not whether or not we launch WhiteHat Magazine; we are a stubborn and frugal bunch, and so that will be happening, funded or no.
The big risk here is in the quality of the content we are able to provide at launch. Obviously, with a fully funded campaign, we can pay more writers and provide better content, which turns into a cycle of attracting more subscribers --> getting more income --> paying for even better content. 
We have chosen to do a flexible funded campaign because every little bit helps us create this new platform, and every dollar brings potential for awesomeness.

<p>Brooklyn has long been known as one of the most vibrant poetry communities in the world. But there has yet to be an anthology celebrating the many contemporary poets who call it home. Brooklyn Poets and Brooklyn Arts Press are teaming up to publish the <i>Brooklyn Poets Anthology</i>, a landmark collection celebrating Brooklyn's contemporary poetry scene, emphasizing a variety of voices, aesthetics and traditions.</p>
<p>170 poets will be included: Philip Levine, Bernadette Mayer, Vijay Seshadri, Edward Hirsch, Tina Chang, D. Nurkse, Aracelis Girmay, Martín Espada, Cathy Park Hong, Gregory Pardlo, Kimiko Hahn, Kim Addonizio, Lemon Andersen, Patricia Spears Jones, Timothy Donnelly, Tyehimba Jess, Dorothea Lasky, Matthea Harvey, Patrick Rosal, Joshua Mehigan, Leigh Stein, Rachel Eliza Griffiths, Jessica Greenbaum, Tom Sleigh, Nick Flynn, Angel Nafis, Matthew Rohrer, Morgan Parker, Meghan O'Rourke, Ana Božičević, Ocean Vuong, Rickey Laurentiis, John Murillo, Floyd Skloot, Cynthia Cruz, Amy King, Matvei Yankelevich, Natalie Eilbert, Ken Chen, David Tomas Martinez, Hala Alyan, Tommy Pico, Nicole Sealey, Wendy Xu, Bianca Stone, Robert Gibbons, Christopher Soto, Candace Williams and many more.</p>
<h3><strong>Why We Need Your Help</strong></h3>
<p>Because of the size of the anthology (450+ pages), this book will cost more than the usual poetry publication. We project the cost of publishing, shipping and promoting the anthology to be in the ballpark of $10,000. We have already applied for $5000 in grant funding, which we hope to use to cover the cost of the first print run in March 2017 and printing/shipping copies to contributors (as payment) in April 2017. Your contribution will help us cover the initial $3000 cost of design, production, supplies, shipping, review-copy printing and other pertinent presale aspects of publishing. Help us reach our stretch goal of $6000 and we can cover a good portion of our expenses even if we don't get the grant. And if we do, we can put any extra funds toward further publicizing the work of all of these amazing writers in our attempt to reach as wide an audience as possible.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>We’ve worked to create an anthology that offers a panoramic snapshot of the talent, richness and diversity found within the Brooklyn poetry community, which is itself of course a collection of different communities. Brooklyn remains a constantly shifting landscape of restless, unique voices, and this anthology attempts to give its readers a broad understanding of what is happening here now. And because no single anthology is ever definitive or completely representative, we intend this volume to be the first of a series, so that we might continue to present the ongoing evolution of poetry written within this extraordinary borough. </p>

<h3><strong>About Us</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""http://brooklynartspress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brooklyn Arts Press</a> (BAP) is an independent house devoted to publishing new works by emerging artists. We believe we serve our community best by publishing great works of varying aesthetics side by side, subverting the notion that writers and artists exist in vacuums, apart from the culture in which we reside and outside the realm and understanding of other camps and aesthetics. We believe experimentation and innovation, arriving by way of given forms or new ones, make our culture greater through diversity of perspective, opinion, expression, and spirit.</p>
<p><a href=""http://brooklynpoets.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brooklyn Poets</a> is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization celebrating and cultivating the poets, poetry and literary heritage of Brooklyn, the birthplace of American poetry. Since our inception in 2012, our core program of small, intensive poetry workshops taught by award-winning poets in their own homes has served over 300 students and employed over 30 teachers, and we’ve grown to host 22 events per year attracting over 1000 attendees annually, fostering a more close-knit, homegrown, diverse community of poets and readers than what we see traditionally offered by graduate writing programs and the American literary community at large. Our community extends through <a href=""http://poetsbridge.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Bridge</a>, a unique online network connecting poets and mentors throughout the world—a <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-bridge-building-a-better-community-for-poets/x/4489390#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">project</a> we successfully funded on Indiegogo in 2013.</p>

About Us
Brooklyn Arts Press (BAP) is an independent house devoted to publishing new works by emerging artists. We believe we serve our community best by publishing great works of varying aesthetics side by side, subverting the notion that writers and artists exist in vacuums, apart from the culture in which we reside and outside the realm and understanding of other camps and aesthetics. We believe experimentation and innovation, arriving by way of given forms or new ones, make our culture greater through diversity of perspective, opinion, expression, and spirit.
Brooklyn Poets is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization celebrating and cultivating the poets, poetry and literary heritage of Brooklyn, the birthplace of American poetry. Since our inception in 2012, our core program of small, intensive poetry workshops taught by award-winning poets in their own homes has served over 300 students and employed over 30 teachers, and we’ve grown to host 22 events per year attracting over 1000 attendees annually, fostering a more close-knit, homegrown, diverse community of poets and readers than what we see traditionally offered by graduate writing programs and the American literary community at large. Our community extends through The Bridge, a unique online network connecting poets and mentors throughout the world—a project we successfully funded on Indiegogo in 2013.",7.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>What is this book about?</h3>
<p>Hi! We’re a group of impassioned Peruvian women (and one man!) who believe the stories we tell our children matter. Too often, children’s books tell history from a single vantage point, and don’t include diverse voices and ethnic groups. We’re here to change that.</p>
<p>Heroínas Afroperuanas is our fourth children’s book, and is the first book dedicated solely to the stories of Afroperuvian women who contributed immensely to Peru's cultural diversity, and for forward movement of their communities. </p>
<p>This book celebrates the stories of Afroperuvian women, and gives representation to a group that has been historically and contemporarily marginalized, left out, and unheard, socially, economically and politically. Through the stories of different Afroperuvian women throughout history, this book teaches young children about courage, morality, and the ability to create change in their communities and their own world. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627254340/kjfvghzbyqc4qjmizc9n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why did we create this book?</h3>
<p>We created this book because no book like this exists in Latin America. </p>
<p>We believe that representation matters. We want to tell our children stories that are full of diversity, in both gender and ethnicity, that will help raise them in a world that values everyone's contributions, capacity and abilities. A diverse world is a stronger and safer world. </p>
<p>In Peru, the Afroperuvian community has suffered the most marginalization and oppression on behalf of Peruvian society and politics. Of course, the marginalization and oppression of black communities and of the African diaspora is not unique to Peru: we see it everywhere throughout the Americas. </p>
<p>By telling stories of triumph of individuals in this community, we hope to challenge this narrative of marginalization and raise awareness of the many heroes their community is composed of, while giving young Afroperuvian boys and girls a book that represents them and their ancestors.  </p>
<p>We believe that bringing voice to the African diaspora is important, and connects us to a larger, global movement of social change and equality. </p>

<h3>Who is this book for?</h3>
<p>This book is for everyone! </p>
<p>While designed for children, it’s created in a way where everyone can learn, whether you’re a parent, an auntie, a big brother, a librarian, an activist, or anything in between. If you’re a human who believes in cultural diversity, this book is for you. </p>
<p>And while we focus on the Peruvian context, this book isn’t only for Peruvians. The African diaspora is vast and diverse, and we hope that Heroínas Afroperuanas will be a catalyst to spark a broader conversation on the celebration of all black and brown voices, particularly the voices of women.</p>
<p>We are proud to be creating the first children’s book that is solely dedicated to celebrating Afroperuvian culture and history.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise $16,000 for the research, writing, illustrations, production and printing of this book. We put our money where our values are. </p>
<p>All Heroínas Peruanas' materials are produced employing fair wages, and are printed using local, Peruvian companies. For Heroínas Afroperuanas, we have gathered a panel of amazing Afroperuanx individuals–activists, academics, educators and community leaders–to direct the trajectory of the book. This team worked together to choose the women to be featured, conducted the appropriate research to learn about their lives, created the content, and supervised the book’s overall direction. A young Afroperuana illustrator, Shana Arteaga, has made all of the illustrations for the book. </p>
<p>This is their book. A book that celebrates their history, their ancestors, their community, and an opportunity for the youth to see empowering stories of people who look like them. </p>
<p>This is a book made by Afroperuanxs, and we're ready to share it with the world. Heroínas Peruanas has provided the allyship in the production of the book by leading the administration, logistics, editing and printing of the book.</p>
<p>Once the book is available for sale, a percentage of the proceeds of all book sales will go to Afroperuvian initiatives, selected by the Afroperuvian panel. </p>
<p>The breakdown of our budget is as follows:</p>
<p>Salaries: Executive Team (Afroperuana panel): $6,322 – 40%</p>
<p>Editorial Edition: $500 – 3%</p>
<p>Management and Operations: $5,000 – 31%</p>
<p>Marketing: $2,500 – 16%</p>
<p>Printing: $1,653 – 10%</p>
<p>If we are unable to meet our fundraising goal, the first money will be designated to paying the Afroperuvian panel that worked hard and long to make this book happen. </p>

<p>Founded by two Peruvian women who noticed that there were little to no children stories that promoted women’s empowerment and cultural empowerment in the local Peruvian context, Heroínas Peruanas uses educational materials to combat machismo, gender inequality and a lack of diverse voices and representation in Peruvian society and history. We do this primarily through telling the stories of unsung, diverse, women heroes (heroínas) throughout Peruvian history. A model that resonates with cultures and countries the world over, we imagine Heroínas ‘chapters’ (pun intended!) all over the world, starting soon with Heroínas Paraguayas.</p>
<p>We believe deeply that when children are shown stories that display empowerment, courage, morality and agency, particularly when the heroines of those stories look like them, we reinforce to our children that they can be change makers in their communities, too. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: right;"">La Novela</h3>
<p>Un cuerpo ensangrentado a las puertas del único hotel de Portolara. Todo parece reducir el suceso a un accidente laboral o a un suicido, pero su muerte encierra mucho más en un pequeño pueblo pesquero al que prácticamente la mayoría de sus habitantes se les relaciona con el narcotráfico. Tras un minucioso estudio de la escena del crimen surgen las primeras dudas y comienza una particular lucha contra la idiosincrasia de un pueblo afincado en la más absoluta apatía... «Ha muerto, sí, como todos lo haremos algún día».</p>
<p>Hasta el individuo más idiota puede parecer inteligente.</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Play to Learn: How to Use Video Games to Learn a New Language </i><br/><br/>As the title suggests the book is about learning using video games. In this book, I mention the benefits, applications, and concerns of video games. I cited research on how students learn a new language in situations when an educator is present or absent and supplement them with real gameplay examples and personal experiences if possible. Lastly, I give the readers my view on how to set goals and choose games to learn a new language.<br/><br/>My name is Tianshi and I am the author of <i>Play to Learn: How to Use Video Games to Learn a New Language</i>. I wrote this book because I want to share my experience of learning a language with video games.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to learn a new language with video games along with teaching theories. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement I have for video games and education in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you become a better language learner.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about video games and language learning theories:<p>Personal gameplay experience with video games</p>
<p>Research on language learning in both self and classroom settings using video games.</p>
<p>Detailed and personal verified steps to guide you to learn a new language using video games as a tool</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are a gamer, language learner, or educator.<br/><br/><i>Play to Learn: How to Use Video Games to Learn a New Language</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to video game players and language learners who are looking at video games and language learning for the first time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - Play to Learn: How to Use Video Games to Learn a New Language</h2> The book is written in Five Parts....<br/><br/>Part [1] contains the introduction + general background of video games.<br/><br/>It introduces the detailed genre and platform of video games along with what video games do to keep player engaged and motivated. I mention nine genres of games defined by Griffiths in 1996, and mention in detail what is intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and how video games using those features to keep us motivated with many gameplay examples.<br/><br/>Part [2] contains Chapters [3-5]. These three chapters mention how video games do not cause violence and addiction, despite people’s negative perceptions on them. This is something easy to controlled, the benefits of using video games in language learning are discussed along with many education institutions, corporations, and organizations are still utilizing video games in their works. I tell of a notorious “internet addiction camp” in China where parents willingly send their uncooperative child to get rid of “addiction” and “bad habits” which, I believe, is just an excuse for their bad parenting.<br/><br/>Part [3] contains Chapters [6-8]. This part starts to show how educators could use video games in their own teaching. This sections starts by mentioning similar concept edutainment and then gradually moving to researchers and case studies in relevant fields of how teachers implement video games into their own class and help student to learn language and other subjects, also citing case studies done without a teacher. In such studies, it was found that just by playing games, the student’s language proficiency increased.<br/><br/>Part [4] contains Chapters [9-12]. The goal of this section is to show readers how to set goals with different language proficiency, how to choose video games to learn a new language, and share some of my own experience of using video games to learn English and reach rather high proficiency. In these chapters, I mention how to use education standards as a guide for your goals. To prove this method is feasible to different people and languages, I set myself a very tight schedule in an on-going semester and play games for a short time everyday within a month to learn Spanish, and I think I’m already starting to understand the basics of it.<br/><br/>Part [5] contains Chapters [13]. The conclusion. Where I briefly summarize the entire book.<br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>
<br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>

Even if they can't internalize their achievements, they have personal characteristics inherent to Impostor Syndrome that actually enable their success. The Swan Effect explains what these characteristics are, how to leverage them in the Digital Age, and why feeling like an ""impostor"" is the start to your own success story.</p><p>The Swan Effect: Thriving with Impostor Syndrome in the Digital Age explores how technology, specifically social media, has impacted identity creation and prompted Impostor Syndrome in many individuals. Impostor Syndrome is characterized by feelings of self-doubt when someone believes that their own successes are due to luck or good timing rather than their own capabilities. This book explains the “Impostor Advantage”, or the key advantages of being an “impostor” in the Digital Age as the ways in which we work evolve due to innovation, and companies seek to build a workforce of people who can adapt and excel in these changes.<br/><br/>Hello! My name is Caroline and I am the author of The Swan Effect. I wrote this book with the intention of sharing what I have learned about harnessing Impostor Syndrome and developing the Impostor Advantage through research into psychological studies, the interviews that I have conducted, and my own personal experiences. Much of the discourse on Impostor Syndrome explains how to overcome feeling like an ""impostor,"" but it does not explain why people with Impostor Syndrome are successful, even if they cannot internalize their own success.<br/><br/>Impostor Syndrome is experienced by 70 percent of people at some point in their lives, usually during life milestones or transition periods such as starting a new job or graduate school. These are points when someone may question whether they truly deserve the next step or if the admissions officer or hiring manager has made a mistake. Though Impostor Syndrome can be experienced at any age, with so many major milestones and new life experiences that occur between the ages of 20 to 30, it makes sense why this decade is extremely vulnerable to the impostor phenomenon. This is increased by social media because of the pressure to display achievements and qualifications online. I was compelled to write this book because I wanted to start a discussion on a topic that is not often openly discussed because people usually don’t want to admit that they are feeling like an impostor. I wanted to further explore how technology has impacted Impostor Syndrome and why people who experience it have been successful in the Digital Age.<br/><br/>I hope that this book will shift the narrative on how we look at Impostor Syndrome and provide clarity on the inherent advantages to feeling like an “impostor.” We are in a time where the tenets of Impostor Syndrome have become invaluable assets to individuals working in the Digital Age. It is no longer a syndrome, but an advantage to success in the world of smart machines and automation because the personal characteristics innate to having Impostor Syndrome are irreplaceable by technology.<br/><br/>You will want to read this book if:</p><ul>
<li>You have ever thought to yourself “How did I get here?” when you were stepping into a new office or onto a new campus because you questioned whether the hiring manager or admissions officer made a mistake</li>
<li>You would like to learn more about Impostor Syndrome and the associated personal characteristics that enable workplace success in the Digital Age</li>
<li>You would like to explore how technology and social media have impacted how we form our identities and how we think about our own qualifications and achievements</li>
</ul><p>This book will ultimately show you why having and leveraging your own Impostor Syndrome is key to unlocking success professionally and personally in the Digital Age.</p><p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book.

I wrote this book with the intention of sharing what I have learned about harnessing Impostor Syndrome and developing the Impostor Advantage through research into psychological studies, the interviews that I have conducted, and my own personal experiences. Much of the discourse on Impostor Syndrome explains how to overcome feeling like an ""impostor,"" but it does not explain why people with Impostor Syndrome are successful, even if they cannot internalize their own success.Impostor Syndrome is experienced by 70 percent of people at some point in their lives, usually during life milestones or transition periods such as starting a new job or graduate school. These are points when someone may question whether they truly deserve the next step or if the admissions officer or hiring manager has made a mistake. Though Impostor Syndrome can be experienced at any age, with so many major milestones and new life experiences that occur between the ages of 20 to 30, it makes sense why this decade is extremely vulnerable to the impostor phenomenon. This is increased by social media because of the pressure to display achievements and qualifications online. I was compelled to write this book because I wanted to start a discussion on a topic that is not often openly discussed because people usually don’t want to admit that they are feeling like an impostor. I wanted to further explore how technology has impacted Impostor Syndrome and why people who experience it have been successful in the Digital Age.I hope that this book will shift the narrative on how we look at Impostor Syndrome and provide clarity on the inherent advantages to feeling like an “impostor.” We are in a time where the tenets of Impostor Syndrome have become invaluable assets to individuals working in the Digital Age. It is no longer a syndrome, but an advantage to success in the world of smart machines and automation because the personal characteristics innate to having Impostor Syndrome are irreplaceable by technology.You will want to read this book if:
You have ever thought to yourself “How did I get here?” when you were stepping into a new office or onto a new campus because you questioned whether the hiring manager or admissions officer made a mistake
You would like to learn more about Impostor Syndrome and the associated personal characteristics that enable workplace success in the Digital Age
You would like to explore how technology and social media have impacted how we form our identities and how we think about our own qualifications and achievements
This book will ultimately show you why having and leveraging your own Impostor Syndrome is key to unlocking success professionally and personally in the Digital Age.What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h3>Barry! A Citizen Blogger's Commentary on the 44th President<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In the
summer of 2013, I drafted a list of affirmations; one of them was to
""Finish what I started."" In 2010 I decided to write a book of poetry
and essays, which included a chapter on President Barack Obama. Now three years
later driven by the power of my affirmations, I am on the verge of finishing
the book. My book offers what I call a ""Citizen Bloggers'""
perspective on the 44th President. Barry! Is a book that is fair and balanced,
it offers praise when necessary, criticism when deserved, but also looks at the
historic rise of Barack Obama through the lens of history, comparing him to
former Presidents Jimmy Carter, and Lyndon Johnson as it appeared he was headed
for a ""One and Done"" term. </p>
<p>I also
viewed President Obama through the lens of what I see as the eroding power of
the President in my blog The Emasculated POTUS. In 2012, I urged him to bring
""fire"" to the 2012 Democratic National Convention with a blog titled
“Fire Next Time, and after his disastrous first debate, I suggested that
President Obama was “Throwing the election, not “Blowing” it.  applauded his remarks in the aftermath of the
George Zimmerman verdict. Finally it was impossible to discuss the Obama
Presidency without discussing race, as I did often including my 2012 blog where
I wrote the GOP 2012 strategy was reduced to “Blame the Black Guy”. While my
words are mine, the photos that I want to add to the project are not.</p>
<p>This
IndieGoGo Project is to assist me in purchasing photos like the one with then
candidate Senator Obama in my home town in St. Louis, as well as other iconic
photos that mark both the 2008 and 2012 campaigns and his first term. My book
goes to publication in late December, it is my hope to include between 1 - 15
copyrighted photo files with the submission. 
Finally a note about the importance of this project, as I mentioned
completing this book allows me not only to complete what I started, but this
book helps to serve notice of a new voice is clamoring to be heard, a voice
that speaks  to a larger narrative of
individual and community empowerment, social justice, political awareness, and
the need to follow one’s passion. This book project is one of many ways I am
introducing myself to the larger public. I appreciate those who decide to be a
part of this process.</p>

<p>My
 name is Catheryn Brockett.  <br/></p><p>I am an actor and writer living in Los

 Here's an understatement; cancer sucks.  It's scary, it's gross, it's 
heartbreaking, lonely and absurd...  </p>
<p>At first I didn't want to talk about it.  I couldn't even say <i>the word.  </i>It
 was, I don't know  private, embarrassing, and pretty much a 
conversation killer.  I looked around for other women to tell me their 
stories, I wanted to hear the truth about what they went through, about <i>life</i> with cancer.<br/></p>
<p><b>""Stories can conquer fear you know, they can make the heart larger."" Ben Okri</b></p>
<p>... and then, well - I'm an actor, a comedian for Pete's sake - and things just kept happening...</p>
<h4>""We're not laughing at the cancer - we're laughing at you.""  </h4>
<p>How could I <i>not </i>tell the story...</p>
<ul>
<li>About how during reconstruction - I ended up with <b><i>one</i></b> 600cc
 boob? (yes, that's the size of a bowling ball, a baby's head.. and my 
other remained an unenthusiastic 'b.' I called them Porn Boob and Sad 
Banana) <i><b>and it was inflatable!</b></i>
</li>
<li>About working as an actor during this time to keep my insurance eligibility and having a wardrobe girl (after discovering she <i>could not</i> dress me in a halter top) ask me, ""was it elective?""</li>
<li>About having to tell my date I had cancer?!  (you <i>sure</i> you don't want another glass of wine?)</li>
<li>About sleeping on my couch for two years (first it was medical, then it was mental).</li>
<li>About deciding to have a bilateral mastectomy after all and about how that felt brave and cowardly all at the same time.</li>

<p>“I read the entire cancercation story…enthralled, inspired, in tears, and…in prayer. Keep blogging and keep healing!”

</p>
<p><b>And I started telling my stories out loud. </b></p>
<p>“This
 touched my heart. Made me cry. Too many people I love or are close to 
have been afflicted by this. This is a brave and honest report of breast
 cancer.""  <br/></p><h4>So now I want to turn these stories into a book - and here's what I need the money for.

</p><p>Cancer

<p>I
 would love to get a traditional publisher, and if that happens I will 
only have to pay for the editing/writing services and publicity (it's

<h3>One in eight women will get breast cancer.  </h3><p>I tell you this not to scare
 you, just know that when you look around a crowded room, there is 
someone who is affected by this disease and it can be hard to talk 
about. From my own personal experience, I still feel a weird taboo.  In
 publishing my memoir I hope to reach people with my story and either 
inspire them to tell their own, or at least remind them that in the 
darkest moments there is always the potential to laugh as well as cry.

</div></div>","The Settlement House American Poetry Prize acknowledges the importance of the immigrant legacy and potential as a force for social justice, tolerance and goodwill in the United States.Initiated in 2014, the Settlement
House American Poetry Prize includes publication by Settlement House of a
collection of poems in English by a first-generation American (including both
immigrants and children born of immigrants to the United States.) The inaugural
recipient of the award is Alicia Partnoy for her book Flowering Fires/Fuegos
florales, translated into English by the poet Gail Wronsky.
The Prize alternates annually between a book written in the language of a
poet’s ancestry and translated into English and a collection of poems written
in English. The 2015 award will honor a book written in English and
will include a cash stipend and a standard publishing contract.
Your support will help defray
publishing and distribution costs of Flowering Fires / Fuegos Florales as well as publication costs for the Settlement House American
Poetry Prize first open competition in 2015. In addition, we hope to offer two free copies of each winning collection to the more than 100 active settlement and neighborhood houses in the United States. (Note: We are not a settlement house and have no such affiliation.)  Please visit our blog.

                              Settlement House is an independent book publisher founded in 2007. We take our name from the settlement houses of the late 19th, 20th and current centuries that continue to provide community through their social and cultural support and service to the urban poor and immigrant populations. In that spirit, we think of ourselves as a home for some of the fine—and frequently disparate—voices of poetry deserving of greater readership today .

     Rapid Eye Movements
Sometimes in dreams
we encounter a man
or  a woman from the
past.
We make love to them
by mistake
fervently.
We talk to them about things
that ought to matter to them
now.

What betrays them
is the excessive enthusiasm
or the excessive sadness of their bodies.
What betrays us
is this foolish insistence on the present.
In any case,
they almost always respond
as if nothing had . . .
as if nothing.

<p>She looked at me with such pain in her sunken eyes and whispered in a hoarse voice “ I feel so ashamed”.</p>
<p>“Six years ago we said “in sickness and health””. I whispered back, looking into her eyes, stroking her face, still so beautiful in spite of everything, and said as reassuringly as I could, my voice shaking as I fought back the tears, “Nothing is too much trouble. Nothing”. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We held each other and sobbed. It was the worst moment of my life and hers too I think. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It was also the best. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She had become too weak to go to the bathroom on her own and of all the slings and arrows of sickness, this robbing of her dignity was one of the worst for her. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There was one thing worse. Something that weighed so heavily on her, in spite of her constant efforts to remain positive and strong, and that was the terrible realisation she would not get to see her children grow up. This, of all things, was too painful to bear.</p>

<p>Harriet passed away on April the 3rd 2005. Tilly was a week away from her second birthday and Thomas was not quite five.</p>

Harriet and Tilly<br/><p>__________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Overview:</b></p>
<p>Travels with an African Husky is an uplifting true story of an English photographer and his two kids who lose their mother to cancer and adopt an abandoned husky found on the streets of small rural town at the very bottom end of Africa.</p>
<p>It is about loss, love, travel, food, humour and the triumphs and disasters of a man raising two kids. </p>
<p>And it is about a husky. A beautiful, adorable, naughty, independently-minded husky who mothers two children and a man. </p>
<p>The book will include a lot of photos from the journey.</p>
<p>This is a dog-centric story, but only to the extent that it provides a thread to bring a lot of disparate non-dog stories together. It is as much a story about love, and my children and the amazing places we have lived in and some extraordinary people.</p>
<p>On a different note, raising kids as a single parent is not easy and, for us, the past few years have presented some difficult financial challenges. So I have to sa<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">y one of my motivations for writing this book is that it might go some way to feeding my kids (and my dog). I am, however, also concerned that in benefitting from something terrible that happened, it is a bit tactless and I am not showing respect to Harriet and all the people who loved her, but my sense is that she is willing me on to do this. Especially because her soul is also in this book and lives on through her kids.</span></p>

My face hurt from smiling so much. This was my cue to stop grieving and start living again. And for the kids too. Even Ian and Bertie, the street dogs we bought with us from England, had a new zing in their step.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Ian was a Greyhound German Shepherd mix who was always up to no good, often leaving me to pick up the pieces. Sometimes literally. Like the time he bit the tail off a Greyhound and had a determined go at removing the testicles from her mate. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The dogs arrived in Cape Town a few days after us. I picked them up from the airport and took them straight to beach. Ian got out of the car and walked purposefully up to two guys lying on the sand. With some trepidation I watched wondering what mischief he was about to do, when, to my astonishment, he cocked his leg and peed on the head of one of them. Mayhem ensued. Especially when Bertie the Jack Russell decided to get in on the excitement by peeing on the guy’s leg as I proffered obsequious apologies. At which point the guy told me to just stop talking and go away. Although, I hope you understand, those were not the actual words he used. He was after all quite cross. And wet.</p>

<h3>Background:</h3>
<p>I am English, but I have spent a lot of my life living in the sunnier parts of the world. </p>
<p>In 1997, when I lived in London, I met a woman I quite fancied. Her name was Harriet. In fact I fancied her a lot and, I'm pleased to say, she seemed to like me. We got married, bought a small farm, rescued a couple of mad dogs and had two kids. In July 2004 Harriet had a very bad bleed. The next day they found a 7cm tumour on her cervix. Nine months later my wonderful 38 year old wife was dead.</p>
<p>18 months later I closed down my life in England and took my children, dogs and stuff to South Africa where I trained as a photographer at the Cape Town School of Photography.  I did a big project off my own bat where I photographed and interviewed 26 WWII pilots in then-and-now formats. This will be made into a photo book next year. I am also collating images and stories of women pilots who flew for the Soviet Union in WWII.</p>
<p>After Harriet died I kept a diary of sorts - often just hastily written vignettes scribbled down before I fell asleep. Travels with an African Husky has polished extracts from that diary and hopefully leaves out most of the boring, morose, libelous and woe-is-me stuff. And includes some of the interesting, juicy, scandalous and amusing bits. It also includes a lot of the photos of my journey to and from Africa, England, France and Portugal - where we now live.</p>
<p></p>
In April 2015 it will be ten years since Harriet died and I want to mark that anniversary with this book. The race is on to bring together all the bits and pieces, put them into some order and get the book published by that date. You can play a part in this by pledging for one of the perks and for that I shall be hugely grateful. </div><div>

<p>She dropped her voice to a purr. “This is not just any dog, you wait until you see it”. I knew I was totally powerless as soon as she started her charm offensive on me.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>And so it was, at the bottom end of Africa, at 12h40 on the 26th of February 2011, my life changed forever. I laid eyes for the first time on a very special six month old Siberian Husky. “My word!” I said. “She has the most amazing blue eyes”. I was smitten. This was Amy and this is her story. </p>

Amy the African Husky                    Copyright JohnBradleyPhotography.com
Extract from the first chapter: 

She looked at me with such pain in her sunken eyes and whispered in a hoarse voice “ I feel so ashamed”.
“Six years ago we said “in sickness and health””. I whispered back, looking into her eyes, stroking her face, still so beautiful in spite of everything, and said as reassuringly as I could, my voice shaking as I fought back the tears, “Nothing is too much trouble. Nothing”. 


We held each other and sobbed. It was the worst moment of my life and hers too I think. 


It was also the best. 


She had become too weak to go to the bathroom on her own and of all the slings and arrows of sickness, this robbing of her dignity was one of the worst for her. 


There was one thing worse. Something that weighed so heavily on her, in spite of her constant efforts to remain positive and strong, and that was the terrible realisation she would not get to see her children grow up. This, of all things, was too painful to bear.


Harriet passed away on April the 3rd 2005. Tilly was a week away from her second birthday and Thomas was not quite five.





   
Harriet and Tilly__________________________________________



Overview:
Travels with an African Husky is an uplifting true story of an English photographer and his two kids who lose their mother to cancer and adopt an abandoned husky found on the streets of small rural town at the very bottom end of Africa.
It is about loss, love, travel, food, humour and the triumphs and disasters of a man raising two kids. 
And it is about a husky. A beautiful, adorable, naughty, independently-minded husky who mothers two children and a man. 
The book will include a lot of photos from the journey.
This is a dog-centric story, but only to the extent that it provides a thread to bring a lot of disparate non-dog stories together. It is as much a story about love, and my children and the amazing places we have lived in and some extraordinary people.
On a different note, raising kids as a single parent is not easy and, for us, the past few years have presented some difficult financial challenges. So I have to say one of my motivations for writing this book is that it might go some way to feeding my kids (and my dog). I am, however, also concerned that in benefitting from something terrible that happened, it is a bit tactless and I am not showing respect to Harriet and all the people who loved her, but my sense is that she is willing me on to do this. Especially because her soul is also in this book and lives on through her kids.


Harriet and Tilly


Thomas and Harriet__________________________________________Another extract from the first chapter:
18 months later we swapped gloomy wet England for a new life in Cape Town, a city so full of light and energy it filled the senses. My face hurt from smiling so much. This was my cue to stop grieving and start living again. And for the kids too. Even Ian and Bertie, the street dogs we bought with us from England, had a new zing in their step.


Ian was a Greyhound German Shepherd mix who was always up to no good, often leaving me to pick up the pieces. Sometimes literally. Like the time he bit the tail off a Greyhound and had a determined go at removing the testicles from her mate. 


The dogs arrived in Cape Town a few days after us. I picked them up from the airport and took them straight to beach. Ian got out of the car and walked purposefully up to two guys lying on the sand. With some trepidation I watched wondering what mischief he was about to do, when, to my astonishment, he cocked his leg and peed on the head of one of them. Mayhem ensued. Especially when Bertie the Jack Russell decided to get in on the excitement by peeing on the guy’s leg as I proffered obsequious apologies. At which point the guy told me to just stop talking and go away. Although, I hope you understand, those were not the actual words he used. He was after all quite cross. And wet.

Background:
I am English, but I have spent a lot of my life living in the sunnier parts of the world. 
In 1997, when I lived in London, I met a woman I quite fancied. Her name was Harriet. In fact I fancied her a lot and, I'm pleased to say, she seemed to like me. We got married, bought a small farm, rescued a couple of mad dogs and had two kids. In July 2004 Harriet had a very bad bleed. The next day they found a 7cm tumour on her cervix. Nine months later my wonderful 38 year old wife was dead.
18 months later I closed down my life in England and took my children, dogs and stuff to South Africa where I trained as a photographer at the Cape Town School of Photography.  I did a big project off my own bat where I photographed and interviewed 26 WWII pilots in then-and-now formats. This will be made into a photo book next year. I am also collating images and stories of women pilots who flew for the Soviet Union in WWII.
After Harriet died I kept a diary of sorts - often just hastily written vignettes scribbled down before I fell asleep. Travels with an African Husky has polished extracts from that diary and hopefully leaves out most of the boring, morose, libelous and woe-is-me stuff. And includes some of the interesting, juicy, scandalous and amusing bits. It also includes a lot of the photos of my journey to and from Africa, England, France and Portugal - where we now live.

In April 2015 it will be ten years since Harriet died and I want to mark that anniversary with this book. The race is on to bring together all the bits and pieces, put them into some order and get the book published by that date. You can play a part in this by pledging for one of the perks and for that I shall be hugely grateful. 

Thomas and the horse he befriended.
__________________________________________Another extract from the first chapter:
She dropped her voice to a purr. “This is not just any dog, you wait until you see it”. I knew I was totally powerless as soon as she started her charm offensive on me.


And so it was, at the bottom end of Africa, at 12h40 on the 26th of February 2011, my life changed forever. I laid eyes for the first time on a very special six month old Siberian Husky. “My word!” I said. “She has the most amazing blue eyes”. I was smitten. This was Amy and this is her story.

__________________________________________
What I Need:I have set the funding goal at $5000. Based on four quotes I have received this will be enough to get the book printed and cover the costs of printing portraits of Amy for the signed portrait perk.Please visit the perks section and if there is something there that presses a button for you, I would be delighted if you would make a pledge. I shall personally despatch your signed book or print. 

Amy and Tilly 
What You Get:

Perks:
The perks are explained in the Perks section, but they include an eBook, a signed hardcopy photo-rich book, and photographic prints with Amy's paw mark. 
What if the funding goal is not reached?
If the funding goal is not reached I shall carry on and do this book anyway, it will just be a whole lot more difficult to get it finished by the anniversary of my wife's death. It also means the printed version may take a lot longer.

  The Impact I hope my book will bring pleasure to people - both the words and the images . They are part of my soul. I hope it will make people laugh (and cry - yes, I want to make you cry!) and, without thrusting it in peoples' faces, get across a couple messages about looking after our health and huskies (explained below). 
Risks & Challenges
  The main risks and obstacles to finishing this project are related to time and money. In other words juggling my short term needs to look after my kids and get things done with the book. I am now an old-hand at doing this and I shall continue to carry on as I have.  In fact as my kids are now a bit older, some aspects of looking after them are easier and I have more time to work - particularly when they are at school and after they have gone to bed, which gives me at least eight or nine hours a day to work. 

  Other Ways You Can Help If You Can't Donate Money

If you can't donate money, there are other ways you can help. I would be really really grateful if you could please use the Indiegogo share tools at the top of the page and tell everyone you know so they also know about the book.

Merely organize society to act in harmony with this lesson. Let society's legal apparatus remove all obstacles the best it can. Permit these creative know-hows freely to flow. Have faith that free men and women will respond to the Invisible Hand. This faith will be confirmed. I, Pencil, seemingly simple though I am, offer the miracle of my creation as testimony that this is a practical faith, as practical as the sun, the rain, a cedar tree, the good earth.”
 — Leonard E. Read, I, Pencil
For us at ReadLiberty.org, Leonard. E. Read's essay I, Pencil was one of the most eyes opening works and a great inspiration for our liberty oriented activities.
To make his life work more accessible for anyone to read, we've decided to publish his whole library in ePub, Mobi, HTML and PDF formats without reserving any rights, making it free for everyone to read, share, edit and sell.
Since we're producing this edition of Leonard E. Read's library for you, it seems right to offer you a chance of becoming a part of this venture.
Starting with Accent On The Right, you can join us in creating this electronic edition of Leonard E. Read's library and influence the final look of the whole library, have your name forever a part of it or get your own edition of the whole library dedicated namely to you.

When Can You Expect the Library?
An early draft version of the first book, Accent On The Right, is already available at http://www.readliberty.org/books/leonard-e-read-accent-on-the-rightAs you can see, there's still a lot of work to be done on the cover and formatting of the book. But happy reading anyway.

Their spirit and optimism amazes us and inspires us. We'd like to help ensure that they get the attention and treatments that they deserve.</div><div>
<p>We are trying to raise 2000 US dollars for RAYS this year. The funds will be directed to the organization. Even if we do not succeed in reaching our target amount, RAYS will benefit from whatever funds we raise.</p>

<br/></span></div></div>","Please help support a home for rural Indian children in needbecause every child deserves to be cared for!Hello there friends,We are trying to raise funds for a charity (RAYS) run by Devika's family, which runs orphanages for rural Indian children who were born HIV+ and subsequently developed AIDS. Many of these children lost their parents or were abandoned by relatives who were unwilling or unable to care for them. RAYS gives them a home, cares for their needs and education, and counsels them towards a life of possibility and optimism.


RAYS, which was founded in Jaipur four years ago, now cares for 50 children who are HIV+ and employs 10 care-takers who also suffer from AIDS. Caring for children with AIDS is a great responsibility and as a charitable organization RAYS relies on donations and fundraising campaigns to meet the annual needs of these children.We have seen these children grow over the last few years and if you'd ever meet them for the first time, you would'nt even realize that they are terminally ill. Their spirit and optimism amazes us and inspires us. We'd like to help ensure that they get the attention and treatments that they deserve.
We are trying to raise 2000 US dollars for RAYS this year. The funds will be directed to the organization. Even if we do not succeed in reaching our target amount, RAYS will benefit from whatever funds we raise.



You can find out more about the children at a website we've made for this project:

Here is RAYS's official website: http://www.ngoraysjaipur.org/
RAYS is also on facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RAYSNGO?ref=br_tf

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Excerpt from ""The Roots of Resistance""</strong></p>
<p>Behind the curtains of the star-strewn sky, just beyond the edge of ordinary sight, Love churned as vast as plate tectonics and as powerful as thunderstorms. It pressed against the edges of reality, seeking to crack the barriers of awareness that blocked it. Zadie recognized this Great Love - the kind that sears the soul and hauls us back from human folly, the Love reverberating in revolutions of the heart, the Love that scorches cruelty away as it rises, the Love that breaks our hearts and turns out its contents to those in need.</p>
<p><i>Life wants to live, but more that that, it wants to love. </i>Simple survival is not enough. Mere procreation leaves mothers turning their faces to the wall and fathers hanging from the rafters. Fallen in the wasteland, thirst alone may leave us collapsed, abandoning our bodies to the vultures. But love? For the hope of saving our children, seeing our beloved, or protecting our communities, we stagger to our feet and stumble forward on the burning sand. To save her granddaughter, an elderly woman can find the strength to lift a crushing vehicle. For his father, a son plunges into the flames of a burning house. We shoulder the unbearable, accomplish the impossible, endure the unthinkable by the intensity of our love.</p>
<p>These stories of love emerge on every continent, in every town. Multiplied by millions, they create a song of life louder than the small-hearted survivalists, richer than the death mongers and their addictions. More enduring than despair, more grounded than hope, this song reverberates in the genetic strands of humanity, woven into the biological structure of human life. Deep in history, our foremothers loved their children. Far in the future, our descendants love their families. In this present moment, which hangs like a bead of dew on the grass stem of time, where the life of the planet lies clouded by question marks and the body of humanity lies massive and sprawled in a wasteland of our own making, the love song of our ancestors and descendants is calling to us to rise. The hymn of life hums in the throats of our brothers and sisters. The chords of evolution roar and bark, howl and hiss, warble and moan from the tongues of fellow animals. The wind strikes the harp strings of the forests and marshes, prairies and mountains. The great tympani of the coasts booms and crashes across the cymbals of sands and the drum barrels of rocks.</p>
<p>All that is needed is to listen. The love song of the world enters our souls through the language of life. Our touchstone of strength forms the shape of our beloveds. Courage surges into our limbs. We rise. One foot steps in the direction of change. This is the Love that thrusts the world through eternity and carries us forward into the infinity of tomorrow. It sings overhead, scouring the barriers of reality, looking for an opening.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Thank you for your generous and loving support! You are amazing!</strong></p>

Excerpt from ""The Roots of Resistance""
Behind the curtains of the star-strewn sky, just beyond the edge of ordinary sight, Love churned as vast as plate tectonics and as powerful as thunderstorms. It pressed against the edges of reality, seeking to crack the barriers of awareness that blocked it. Zadie recognized this Great Love - the kind that sears the soul and hauls us back from human folly, the Love reverberating in revolutions of the heart, the Love that scorches cruelty away as it rises, the Love that breaks our hearts and turns out its contents to those in need.
Life wants to live, but more that that, it wants to love. Simple survival is not enough. Mere procreation leaves mothers turning their faces to the wall and fathers hanging from the rafters. Fallen in the wasteland, thirst alone may leave us collapsed, abandoning our bodies to the vultures. But love? For the hope of saving our children, seeing our beloved, or protecting our communities, we stagger to our feet and stumble forward on the burning sand. To save her granddaughter, an elderly woman can find the strength to lift a crushing vehicle. For his father, a son plunges into the flames of a burning house. We shoulder the unbearable, accomplish the impossible, endure the unthinkable by the intensity of our love.
These stories of love emerge on every continent, in every town. Multiplied by millions, they create a song of life louder than the small-hearted survivalists, richer than the death mongers and their addictions. More enduring than despair, more grounded than hope, this song reverberates in the genetic strands of humanity, woven into the biological structure of human life. Deep in history, our foremothers loved their children. Far in the future, our descendants love their families. In this present moment, which hangs like a bead of dew on the grass stem of time, where the life of the planet lies clouded by question marks and the body of humanity lies massive and sprawled in a wasteland of our own making, the love song of our ancestors and descendants is calling to us to rise. The hymn of life hums in the throats of our brothers and sisters. The chords of evolution roar and bark, howl and hiss, warble and moan from the tongues of fellow animals. The wind strikes the harp strings of the forests and marshes, prairies and mountains. The great tympani of the coasts booms and crashes across the cymbals of sands and the drum barrels of rocks.
All that is needed is to listen. The love song of the world enters our souls through the language of life. Our touchstone of strength forms the shape of our beloveds. Courage surges into our limbs. We rise. One foot steps in the direction of change. This is the Love that thrusts the world through eternity and carries us forward into the infinity of tomorrow. It sings overhead, scouring the barriers of reality, looking for an opening.
Thank you for your generous and loving support! You are amazing!

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong><br/><br/><i>Claudia lives in a very small town in Southern Italy where the cobblestone streets are so narrow you can’t even have a car, not that there is any money for one. There’s no money, no food and barely any education. All around her is poverty and death and nothing to do but marry a local boy and start a family of her own. But she has a feeling that there’s more for her out in the world. One fateful visit from a distant relative and suddenly she knows what she needs to do. Despite all the obstacles she knows she has to face, she sets out on a very difficult and unknown journey that challenges her every step of the way. A journey that will either be the best thing she’s ever done or the biggest mistake of her life.</i></p>

<p>My hope is that you will discover that having dreams and fighting to realize those dreams are what makes for an exciting life. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to break away from limitations and make big changes in your life. To learn that perseverance can really pay off.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Beyond the Cobblestones</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do I want to achieve in my life and where do I begin?</li>
<li>How can I make life better for my family and others who are important to me?</li>
<li>How can I show others that they are not bound by how their life began?</li>

<h3>Transdimensional philosophy, outsider literature, reality-recognising children’s books &amp; radiant black comedy…</h3>
<p>I am an author of non-fiction and fiction; mostly accessible philosophy, social criticism and outsider literature, but also love-stories, comedy and children’s books. My work has been endorsed by Terry Gilliam, John Zerzan, Chris Morris, John Pilger, Media Lens, Galen Strawson, Alain de Botton, Ran Prieur and many others. My last book, a radical guide to the entire system, <i>33 Myths of the System</i>, has been downloaded well over 50,000 times, shared and discussed across the fringe internet.</p>
<p>I want to create beautiful physical objects — like my first book, <i>The Apocalypedia</i>, accidentally published by Green Books — but no publisher will take the risk. Some agents love my work, even some publishers, but ‘it won’t sell’. In fact no media company can now take the risk on truthful or original work, which is <a href=""https://expressiveegg.org/2020/03/21/the-myth-of-culture/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">why there is so little of it today</a> — when we need it most.</p>
<p>I am currently working on the follow-up to <i>33 Myths of the System</i>  — <i>Self and Unself</i> — and my wife has started my graphic novel, <i>Sam How: Rabbit</i>. I also have two novels and two television scripts finished. To publish these and to finish what I am working on now will take time and money, neither of which I have or am likely to get.</p>
<p>These books all, in one way or another, directly address the reality of the world — and of human consciousness — as it actually is. There is nothing like what I am producing. These books have to appear, and soon, so I am asking for funding for a year of writing and publishing. I am asking for enough money to drastically cut down on the wage-labour I am currently engaged in, which is keeping me from doing what I should be doing, and to publish my books to the standard they deserve.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How Much I Need and What I Can Give in Return…</h3>
<p>To cut down on paid work for a year, work on <i>Self and Unself</i> and <i>Sam How</i>, typeset and design them, and then get them — along with <i>Drowning is Fine</i> and <i>33 Myths of the System</i> — printed, I need at least £12,000. If I don’t reach this goal, funds will go towards publishing what I have, as and when it is finished. If I somehow overshoot the funding target, I will publish more (my other novel, <i>Dawn</i> and various essays and stories, possibly the Spanish translation of <i>33 Myths</i> that is now being finished off), my wife can take extra time on <i>Sam How</i> and if I overshoot by a long way I can create a publishing company, publish a few glorious beacons in these dark times, perhaps produce a couple of short films or a pilot for one of my shows.</p>
<p>In return for funding you’ll get, first of all, what George Harrison said he wanted to get from funding the <i>Life of Brian</i> — to see it. I will offer digital copies to people who donate £20 along with physical copies for higher donations. The highest donations will be recognised in the books themselves.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: As you can see, I have now, almost miraculously, achieved my goal, which guarantees what I have will be published and Self &amp; Unself (and eventually Sam How) will be written. Praise the gods, I can grow some flowers in the desert, which I look forward, very much, to sharing with everyone as they bloom.</strong></p>
<h3>But Why…?</h3>
<p>Those of you who have read <i>The Apocalypedia</i> (available <a href=""https://expressiveegg.org/portfolio/apocalypedia/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>), <i>Belly Up!</i> (<a href=""https://expressiveegg.org/portfolio/belly-up/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>) and my free book <i>33 Myths of the System</i> (available <a href=""https://expressiveegg.org/portfolio/33-myths-of-the-system/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>) will have a good idea of what I have to offer. If you are new to my work, please take a look at my website (<a href=""https://expressiveegg.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>).</p>
<p>Here is a brief selection of quotes from readers.</p>
<ul>
<li>I've been studying your blog and the <i>Apocalypedia</i> for the better part of a year now, and I'm constantly amazed at the clarity, but also poignancy and humor of your writing…</li>
<li>Your website is a gift to our times: I learned truths that have made me more alive, and reminded me of things that I’ve always known, but didn’t have the courage to act on…</li>
<li>I am absolutely fascinated with your book <i>33 Myths of The System</i>. It has left my life in shambles…! </li>
<li>Your writing has been revolutionary to me over the past few months. You have put into words so much of what I feel.</li>
<li>Through reading <i>33 Myths</i>, and in conjunction with the various realities of my new situation, I found the wherewithal to make changes in my life over the last 12 months that I would have not dreamed of making in the years prior.</li>
<li>I recently basically read your entire website and laughed and cried (actually currently still crying).</li>
<li>After reading so many books, it’s hard not to feel you’re just reading the same things, said in different ways but really found this otherwise in your thought and understand of our current state of affairs and how we got here. Genuinely original, very uncommon!</li>
<li>I cried all the time while I was reading it. It also made me sick. As in actual diarrhea and nausea. While mentally it didn’t clash with me, my body reacted to it. I can’t wait to order it. </li>
</ul>
<p>Probably you won’t feel quite such wondrous joy at reading my stuff, but I’ve been looking into the moribund state of civilisation for three decades now; not just that, but, as far as possible, living as ‘if the day had come’. If you’re reading this, you’re probably starting to do the same, and you’re sure to find insights in my work which will strengthen your intuitions and convictions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Alright, Why <i>Now…</i>?</h3>
<p>I wouldn’t be asking for so much money to do all this for myself if, firstly, I hadn’t explored every other option, secondly, if I didn’t think that time was running short for humanity, thirdly if I weren’t skint and, fourthly, if I wasn’t stone cold certain that the world, or — no, not the world, of course not — that its most sensitive denizens need to hear what I have to say.</p>
<p>Here is a brief introduction to the books I have lined up:</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Self &amp; Unself</h3>
<p><i>Self and Unself</i> is a guide to reality and self, covering the breadth and plumbing the depth of human — and non-human — experience. It was originally conceived as the sister volume to <i>33 Myths of the System</i> (originally titled <i>33 Myths of the Ego</i>), the intention being to do for the illusions of the human mind what my previous book did for the human world, but it has since expanded into something richer and stranger.</p>
<p>Western philosophy has had nothing very meaningful to say since Schopenhauer died, a century and a half ago. Only a fool would say he had actually succeeded in furthering the tradition — by bringing it full circle — but I can say that this is my intention and, even if I fail, I’ve made some beautiful discoveries in trying. I’ve also endeavoured, as with my last book, to make the most difficult of subjects — in this case metaphysics, depth psychology and the history of art and religion — accessible and enjoyable.</p>
<p>I have started <i>Self &amp; Unself</i>, but it is currently nowhere near being completed and will take a dreadfully long time to do so if I have to stay in paid employment or — another option, which seems increasingly attractive — walk the earth.</p>
<p>Here’s a brief draft excerpt from the introduction, screen-grabbed from my text editor…</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584906241/gnfzbbwmydgpv8rqrvr2.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Sam How: Rabbit</h3>
<p>The epic story of Sam How, a multi-talented, musical but extremely simple rabbit, living the good life with his friends in a Kentish wood; until the arrival of a pile of shoddily constructed flatpack tables sends him onto an odyssey into central London, where he discovers a strange world of alcoholic pigeons, huge tasteless carrots, sad confused humans and hideous games that nobody seems to be able to win, or enjoy, or even understand. As the heroic rodent seeks out and discovers the source of this epic misery, the forces of darkness gradually close upon his friends back in the forest.</p>

<h3>Drowning is Fine</h3>
<p>Drowning is fine is the story of Daniel Jones, a young man struggling on the outer edge of contemporary London. Life as an artist hasn’t turned out quite as he had expected; instead of weekends in Berlin, beautiful women covered in blue paint and exhilarating parachutes from the pyramid-peaks of fame, he is trapped in an endlessly replicating gallery of one cloned woman, haunted by the bodiless nightmare of Total Work and pinballed by desires he can’t fathom from sexual nightmare to emotional apocalypse. But help is at hand. Igwe the street-cleaner promises to make him wider (for £420), nearly-dead Len shows Daniel that death is not a visitor at the end of life, but a constant enigmatic companion, and his friend Simon is always ready to laugh at Daniel’s romantic failures. Eventually, through a spiraling psychological odyssey down through the offices, brothels, art galleries and psychiatric institutions of London, Daniel arrives at the absurd doors of death herself, where he finds the love and the beauty he was always looking for; but nowhere near where he supposed they would be.</p>
<p>Here’s a page;</p>

<h3>Other Work…</h3>
<p>I have also completed, amongst other things, <strong><i>Dawn</i></strong>, the story of a sensitive and fiery young working-class woman, born into poverty, who through extraordinary adversity, confronts and overcomes her attachment to security and her fear of independence, <i><strong>Fired</strong></i>, a six part black comedy-drama which follows a gently anarchic oddbod who loses a succession of jobs while slowly being drawn into an epic battle between the forces of good and evil (I might turn this into a novel), <i><strong>BUTV</strong></i>, a truly mind-blowing comedy sketch-show; mad, butcherous, beautiful, sweet and mind-bendingly anarchic, <i><strong>Wonderworld</strong></i>, a devastatingly sexy fairy tale for our times and <i><strong>33 Myths of the System</strong></i>, a hyper-radical guide to the unworld entire.</p>
<p><i>Dawn</i> is a follow-up to Drowning is Fine, so no need to release that now, <i>Fired</i> and <i>BUTV</i> are television shows and faaaaar beyond my budget and although I would like to physically publish <i>33 Myths of the System</i> soon, it is <a href=""https://expressiveegg.org/portfolio/33-myths-of-the-system/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">already free and available</a> and so also of less importance.</p>
<p>Here’s a moment from Fired…</p>

These books all, in one way or another, directly address the reality of the world — and of human consciousness — as it actually is. There is nothing like what I am producing. These books have to appear, and soon, so I am asking for funding for a year of writing and publishing. I am asking for enough money to drastically cut down on the wage-labour I am currently engaged in, which is keeping me from doing what I should be doing, and to publish my books to the standard they deserve.

How Much I Need and What I Can Give in Return…
To cut down on paid work for a year, work on Self and Unself and Sam How, typeset and design them, and then get them — along with Drowning is Fine and 33 Myths of the System — printed, I need at least £12,000. If I don’t reach this goal, funds will go towards publishing what I have, as and when it is finished. If I somehow overshoot the funding target, I will publish more (my other novel, Dawn and various essays and stories, possibly the Spanish translation of 33 Myths that is now being finished off), my wife can take extra time on Sam How and if I overshoot by a long way I can create a publishing company, publish a few glorious beacons in these dark times, perhaps produce a couple of short films or a pilot for one of my shows.
In return for funding you’ll get, first of all, what George Harrison said he wanted to get from funding the Life of Brian — to see it. I will offer digital copies to people who donate £20 along with physical copies for higher donations. The highest donations will be recognised in the books themselves.
EDIT: As you can see, I have now, almost miraculously, achieved my goal, which guarantees what I have will be published and Self & Unself (and eventually Sam How) will be written. Praise the gods, I can grow some flowers in the desert, which I look forward, very much, to sharing with everyone as they bloom.
But Why…?
Those of you who have read The Apocalypedia (available here), Belly Up! (here) and my free book 33 Myths of the System (available here) will have a good idea of what I have to offer. If you are new to my work, please take a look at my website (here).
Here is a brief selection of quotes from readers.

I've been studying your blog and the Apocalypedia for the better part of a year now, and I'm constantly amazed at the clarity, but also poignancy and humor of your writing…
Your website is a gift to our times: I learned truths that have made me more alive, and reminded me of things that I’ve always known, but didn’t have the courage to act on…
I am absolutely fascinated with your book 33 Myths of The System. It has left my life in shambles…! 
Your writing has been revolutionary to me over the past few months. You have put into words so much of what I feel.
Through reading 33 Myths, and in conjunction with the various realities of my new situation, I found the wherewithal to make changes in my life over the last 12 months that I would have not dreamed of making in the years prior.
I recently basically read your entire website and laughed and cried (actually currently still crying).
After reading so many books, it’s hard not to feel you’re just reading the same things, said in different ways but really found this otherwise in your thought and understand of our current state of affairs and how we got here. Genuinely original, very uncommon!
I cried all the time while I was reading it. It also made me sick. As in actual diarrhea and nausea. While mentally it didn’t clash with me, my body reacted to it. I can’t wait to order it. 

Probably you won’t feel quite such wondrous joy at reading my stuff, but I’ve been looking into the moribund state of civilisation for three decades now; not just that, but, as far as possible, living as ‘if the day had come’. If you’re reading this, you’re probably starting to do the same, and you’re sure to find insights in my work which will strengthen your intuitions and convictions.

Alright, Why Now…?
I wouldn’t be asking for so much money to do all this for myself if, firstly, I hadn’t explored every other option, secondly, if I didn’t think that time was running short for humanity, thirdly if I weren’t skint and, fourthly, if I wasn’t stone cold certain that the world, or — no, not the world, of course not — that its most sensitive denizens need to hear what I have to say.
Here is a brief introduction to the books I have lined up:

Self & Unself
Self and Unself is a guide to reality and self, covering the breadth and plumbing the depth of human — and non-human — experience. It was originally conceived as the sister volume to 33 Myths of the System (originally titled 33 Myths of the Ego), the intention being to do for the illusions of the human mind what my previous book did for the human world, but it has since expanded into something richer and stranger.
Western philosophy has had nothing very meaningful to say since Schopenhauer died, a century and a half ago. Only a fool would say he had actually succeeded in furthering the tradition — by bringing it full circle — but I can say that this is my intention and, even if I fail, I’ve made some beautiful discoveries in trying. I’ve also endeavoured, as with my last book, to make the most difficult of subjects — in this case metaphysics, depth psychology and the history of art and religion — accessible and enjoyable.
I have started Self & Unself, but it is currently nowhere near being completed and will take a dreadfully long time to do so if I have to stay in paid employment or — another option, which seems increasingly attractive — walk the earth.
Here’s a brief draft excerpt from the introduction, screen-grabbed from my text editor…

Sam How: Rabbit
The epic story of Sam How, a multi-talented, musical but extremely simple rabbit, living the good life with his friends in a Kentish wood; until the arrival of a pile of shoddily constructed flatpack tables sends him onto an odyssey into central London, where he discovers a strange world of alcoholic pigeons, huge tasteless carrots, sad confused humans and hideous games that nobody seems to be able to win, or enjoy, or even understand. As the heroic rodent seeks out and discovers the source of this epic misery, the forces of darkness gradually close upon his friends back in the forest.
Here’s a page in progress…

Drowning is Fine
Drowning is fine is the story of Daniel Jones, a young man struggling on the outer edge of contemporary London. Life as an artist hasn’t turned out quite as he had expected; instead of weekends in Berlin, beautiful women covered in blue paint and exhilarating parachutes from the pyramid-peaks of fame, he is trapped in an endlessly replicating gallery of one cloned woman, haunted by the bodiless nightmare of Total Work and pinballed by desires he can’t fathom from sexual nightmare to emotional apocalypse. But help is at hand. Igwe the street-cleaner promises to make him wider (for £420), nearly-dead Len shows Daniel that death is not a visitor at the end of life, but a constant enigmatic companion, and his friend Simon is always ready to laugh at Daniel’s romantic failures. Eventually, through a spiraling psychological odyssey down through the offices, brothels, art galleries and psychiatric institutions of London, Daniel arrives at the absurd doors of death herself, where he finds the love and the beauty he was always looking for; but nowhere near where he supposed they would be.
Here’s a page;

Other Work…
I have also completed, amongst other things, Dawn, the story of a sensitive and fiery young working-class woman, born into poverty, who through extraordinary adversity, confronts and overcomes her attachment to security and her fear of independence, Fired, a six part black comedy-drama which follows a gently anarchic oddbod who loses a succession of jobs while slowly being drawn into an epic battle between the forces of good and evil (I might turn this into a novel), BUTV, a truly mind-blowing comedy sketch-show; mad, butcherous, beautiful, sweet and mind-bendingly anarchic, Wonderworld, a devastatingly sexy fairy tale for our times and 33 Myths of the System, a hyper-radical guide to the unworld entire.
Dawn is a follow-up to Drowning is Fine, so no need to release that now, Fired and BUTV are television shows and faaaaar beyond my budget and although I would like to physically publish 33 Myths of the System soon, it is already free and available and so also of less importance.
Here’s a moment from Fired…

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<h3>Product Behavior Fit</h3>
<p><i><strong>How an understanding of human behavior drives the world's most successful products.</strong></i></p>
<p>95% of our thoughts, emotions, and learnings happen before we are consciously aware of them. However, much of today’s technology is built based on the other 5%. This is the part users can articulate when they’re in focus groups, when they’re filling out surveys, or when they’re providing feedback to builders about what they think the next version of your product or website should be.<br/><br/>The stories users tell us are often post rationalizations of their decisions. It’s not that they are intentionally lying to us, it’s that much of their decision making happens outside of their conscious awareness. We’re asking users to provide explanations of behaviors they don’t truly understand themselves.</p>
<p>Technology has driven progress for decades and industries have reacted accordingly by dedicating enormous amounts of time and resources to progress in this domain by building bigger, faster, and more sophisticated systems. But what if the key to unlocking the potential of our ventures is not simply faster, better technology, but rather an understanding of what drives human behavior?</p>
<p>An untapped opportunity lies in the fusion of technological innovation and psychological insights.<br/><br/>I believe that technological innovation alone can move us forward, but we can only realize the true potential of what we can build when we blend it with psychology.</p>
<p>My name is Nate Andorsky and I am the author of Product Behavior Fit. I wrote this book because I believe an understanding of the human experience is the secret to building technology to improve human outcomes. </p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how an understanding of what drives human behavior is the key to unlocking the potential of your product. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for understanding what drives human behavior and the ways in which it can be integrated into technology to help us improve human outcomes.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the intersection of behavioral economics and product design:</p>
<ul>
<li>An understanding of what drives human behavior and the internal and external factors that impact our everyday decision-making process</li>
<li>An understanding of behavioral economics and how this field of study manifests itself within product design</li>
<li>Why user interviews, feedback groups, and surveys from users only tell you 5% of the information you need</li>
<li>In-depth analysis of successful consumer-facing software products and how they leverage an understanding of human behavior to drive adoption and engagement</li>
<li>Why taking a behavioral first approach to building products is a must if you want to create products that realize their full potential </li>
<li>A framework for how to integrate the learnings in this book into your own product design</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - Product Behavior Fit</h2>
<p>Product Behavior Fit is a non-fiction book that speaks to technologists, innovators, and entrepreneurs who are looking to understand what drives human behavior to create consumer-facing software products that are built on and understanding of the human experience.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1 - Introduction </strong></p>
<p>I’ll dig deep into how much of our decision making happens outside of our conscious awareness. I'll discuss why asking users what they want and then building it is a flawed approach because users don’t truly know what they want. I’ll make the case that the next revolution will be psychological, not technological, and why those who fail to understand what truly drives human behavior will be left behind.</p> <p><strong>Part 2 - Meeting Our Future Selves</strong></p>
<p>I'll then examine products that help us become better versions of ourselves, such as apps to help us lose weight, eat healthier, exercise more and become smarter.  I’ll examine the psychological headwinds that are preventing us from achieving our future selves and highlight ways to combat them. We'll dig deep into commitment devices, reframing techniques, and behavioral strategies for helping your users build healthy habits. </p> <p><strong>Part 3 - Born to Follow</strong></p>
<p>In this section, we'll dig into how what others do has an impact on what we're likely to do. We make our own decisions based on the choices that we see others making, for better or for worse. We'll dig into why we are so influenced by the crowd and how this can be leveraged successfully in product design.</p> <p><strong>Part 4 - How We View and Process Information</strong></p>
<p>Even the best decision-makers are heavily influenced by their environment. In this section, I’ll discuss the factors outside of ourselves that impact our behavior. From emotional reactance to the processing of visual stimuli to our crippling aversion to change, you’ll be hard-pressed to find an individual who makes truly economically sound decisions. This section explains why. </p> <p><strong>Part 5 - Creating a Base Behavioral Model for Your Product</strong></p>
<p>In the final section, we’ll adjust our focus to the application of these theories. We’ll discuss the ways you can integrate all the behavioral insights we’ve learned throughout this book into actionable techniques for building products. This overview of our Base Behavioral Model creation process will allow you to take a truly behavioral first approach to your product ventures. We will also discuss what the future holds in terms of human behavior and technology.</p>

The Book - Product Behavior Fit
Product Behavior Fit is a non-fiction book that speaks to technologists, innovators, and entrepreneurs who are looking to understand what drives human behavior to create consumer-facing software products that are built on and understanding of the human experience.
Part 1 - Introduction 
I’ll dig deep into how much of our decision making happens outside of our conscious awareness. I'll discuss why asking users what they want and then building it is a flawed approach because users don’t truly know what they want. I’ll make the case that the next revolution will be psychological, not technological, and why those who fail to understand what truly drives human behavior will be left behind. Part 2 - Meeting Our Future Selves
I'll then examine products that help us become better versions of ourselves, such as apps to help us lose weight, eat healthier, exercise more and become smarter.  I’ll examine the psychological headwinds that are preventing us from achieving our future selves and highlight ways to combat them. We'll dig deep into commitment devices, reframing techniques, and behavioral strategies for helping your users build healthy habits.  Part 3 - Born to Follow
In this section, we'll dig into how what others do has an impact on what we're likely to do. We make our own decisions based on the choices that we see others making, for better or for worse. We'll dig into why we are so influenced by the crowd and how this can be leveraged successfully in product design. Part 4 - How We View and Process Information
Even the best decision-makers are heavily influenced by their environment. In this section, I’ll discuss the factors outside of ourselves that impact our behavior. From emotional reactance to the processing of visual stimuli to our crippling aversion to change, you’ll be hard-pressed to find an individual who makes truly economically sound decisions. This section explains why.  Part 5 - Creating a Base Behavioral Model for Your Product
In the final section, we’ll adjust our focus to the application of these theories. We’ll discuss the ways you can integrate all the behavioral insights we’ve learned throughout this book into actionable techniques for building products. This overview of our Base Behavioral Model creation process will allow you to take a truly behavioral first approach to your product ventures. We will also discuss what the future holds in terms of human behavior and technology.
 
What I Need
This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:

The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2020
The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!
The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)
The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication
The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this April.

When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish it. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.
 
What You'll Get
I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

A personally signed copy of my book when I publish
A personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book
Your Name will appear in the acknowledgments section of my book (“With special thanks to...”)
Early access to the introduction of the book
The opportunity to help give me feedback on cover designs and involvement in the selection process
I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share my experiences throughout the writing process
And more...

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer. Specifically, my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies into each pre-order tier of the campaign.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

<div>If you observe the flip book in closer detail, you will notice that the edges are cut in a specific way, so that you can swap between the different sequences. This is the key to the optical illusion that gives <strong>Molecularis</strong> its unique feature of showing you six different animations in just one flip book. You'll have a blast watching people's faces when they see <strong>Molecularis</strong> for the first time and try to understand how it works! :D</div>

<p>And here's the secret: it all depends on the position of your thumb. You can switch between sequences by placing your thumb either in the upper corner, the center or the lower corner of the front edge of the book.</p>

<p>As there are 3 sequences on each side of the book, the images are arranged alternately. This means that you will have sequences 1, 2 and 3 on one side and 4, 5 and 6 when you turn the book around. To proceed with the coloring simply follow each sequence by jumping every 3 pages. You will have better control of the coloring process if you follow each animated element in every sequence. </p>

</div></div>","Hey Indiegogo! Two years ago, we came up with an idea about how to create a new kind of flip book. We wanted to upgrade the classic format and bring it to a whole new level, and this is the result:
 

 
 



 


Molecularis is also an animated coloring book. You can use it in plenty of ways, by coloring, redrawing and varying its content with an endless number of possibilities. Use pencils, markers, watercolors, graphite, brushes, technical pens or whatever technique you prefer.
  
By alternating the colors gradually from one picture to the next and using your favorite color palette, you can not only give the sequences their very own personality, but also bring them to life – as you see them ‘move’ when you flip through the pages.

 


Inside Molecularis, you’ll find a group of small and restless organisms that interact with each other as if they were being observed through a microscope.
Like all flip books, Molecularis relies on the principle of persistence of vision, which in other words, is exactly what your eyes and brain do when you watch a movie. In a flip book, every picture varies gradually from one page to the next, so by flipping the pages with your thumb, they generate the illusion of movement. This simple technique has been around since 1868 and played an important role in the birth of cinema.
Because the sequences are loop animated, after coloring or redrawing, you can create GIFs like this!

The sequences were designed and animated by Jossie Malis, co-founder of Flipboku and best known for his award-winning animated series Bendito Machine. Maybe you've come across this video from the first flip book we created for the show a couple of years ago. Find out more here.

 
 
 

If you observe the flip book in closer detail, you will notice that the edges are cut in a specific way, so that you can swap between the different sequences. This is the key to the optical illusion that gives Molecularis its unique feature of showing you six different animations in just one flip book. You'll have a blast watching people's faces when they see Molecularis for the first time and try to understand how it works! :D
 

 

And here's the secret: it all depends on the position of your thumb. You can switch between sequences by placing your thumb either in the upper corner, the center or the lower corner of the front edge of the book.

As there are 3 sequences on each side of the book, the images are arranged alternately. This means that you will have sequences 1, 2 and 3 on one side and 4, 5 and 6 when you turn the book around. To proceed with the coloring simply follow each sequence by jumping every 3 pages. You will have better control of the coloring process if you follow each animated element in every sequence. 
 
Every single Molecularis is largely hand-produced and the whole process requires a number of steps that rely on careful supervision. We spent a lot of time testing different paper qualities and consulted with several experts until we found the perfect match: high quality 100% recycled heavy paper with a semi-rough surface and a nice smooth finish. It's suitable for all kinds of different techniques and prevents colors from passing through it. Each Molecularis comes with 180 pages (90 sheets). 

 We have a weakness for good packaging, and that’s why we included a sleek slip case to keep your Molecularis safe after you use it. It prevents the pages from wearing out and by the way, it looks awesome on your shelf or wherever you want to keep it.


 

 

As a perfect complement to Molecularis we have created a learning flip book for anyone who wants to try ‘freestyle’ animation :
 

Blanko is a flip book that contains 320 blank pages on which you can animate whatever comes to your mind. If you're new to animation, learn how to get started with 6 of the basic principles we have included: squash and stretch, anticipation, ease in - ease out, arcs, timing and exaggeration. You can use both sides of the flip book.

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>La otra dimensión</strong> marida realidad y leyenda en una historia entrañable y llena de emoción.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Alba decide pasar el verano con su abuela en la localidad de Vélez-Málaga, un pueblo creciente atrapado en una hondonada a la sombra de las montañas de La Maroma. Entre las altas temperaturas que allí se cuecen y la angustia que la alberga al enterarse de la traición de sus amigos, Alba conoce a Ángel, un vecino de su edad, el cual le introduce en su grupo de amigos que la ponen al día de todas las historias del pueblo y sus leyendas.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Los chicos se ceban hablando de la más famosa de las historias que cuentan sus abuelos: gente que desaparece después de perder la cordura. Espectros, que sin vida, no dejan rastro al borde de la muerte. Abrumada por tan elocuentes disparates, Alba al principio no es consciente de que ella es la próxima víctima de la leyenda; una leyenda que ha estado dormida años y que con su llegada ha despertado.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Un viaje apasionante por el pasado en busca de respuestas donde nuestra protagonista se ve forzada a atravesar portales en el tiempo para saber qué está ocurriendo y de alguna manera, poder escapar del trágico final, salvaguardando su cordura y aprendiendo una importante lección de vida.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>

</div></div>","¿Qué?
La otra dimensión marida realidad y leyenda en una historia entrañable y llena de emoción.
Alba decide pasar el verano con su abuela en la localidad de Vélez-Málaga, un pueblo creciente atrapado en una hondonada a la sombra de las montañas de La Maroma. Entre las altas temperaturas que allí se cuecen y la angustia que la alberga al enterarse de la traición de sus amigos, Alba conoce a Ángel, un vecino de su edad, el cual le introduce en su grupo de amigos que la ponen al día de todas las historias del pueblo y sus leyendas.
Los chicos se ceban hablando de la más famosa de las historias que cuentan sus abuelos: gente que desaparece después de perder la cordura. Espectros, que sin vida, no dejan rastro al borde de la muerte. Abrumada por tan elocuentes disparates, Alba al principio no es consciente de que ella es la próxima víctima de la leyenda; una leyenda que ha estado dormida años y que con su llegada ha despertado.
Un viaje apasionante por el pasado en busca de respuestas donde nuestra protagonista se ve forzada a atravesar portales en el tiempo para saber qué está ocurriendo y de alguna manera, poder escapar del trágico final, salvaguardando su cordura y aprendiendo una importante lección de vida.
¿Quiénes?
Tandaia es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.

<h3><strong>So why a... five-quel?</strong></h3>
<p>HELLO EVERYBARDY! This is Stephanie Dogfoot, Desmond Kon Zhicheng-Mingdé, Ng Yi-Sheng, and Rodrigo Dela Peña, Jr.</p>
<p>We are the editors of <i>SingPoWriMo 2018: The Anthology</i>, veterans of this month-long, write-a-poem-a-day challenge. Singapore Poetry Writing Month is really more than just a thing you do on Facebook for the heck of it – it's an annual gathering of like-minded people; a rigorous exercise both demanding and rewarding; as well as a bold, balls-out foray into the literary scene.</p>
<p>Our dear Facebook group has grown to nearly 5,700 members in our fifth year counting, which is just, I don't know, it's a tad overwhelming. But daunted we are not! Thousands of poems were generated this month by poets both seasoned and fresh onto the party boat. Verses inspired by hip hop? Yaaaz. Oodles of odes and heaps of haikus? Owo. Poems flowering from your favourite deadly sins? Ding-a-ling.</p>
<p>In short: Singapore writing simply shows no signs of abating, and this year's edition of the anthology seeks to collect the best of these poems in a sizeable volume, published and released by Math Paper Press by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Poetry. Is. Coming!!</p>
<h3>How does the money work?</h3>
<p>The sheer amount of poetry generated this year is larger than it's ever been, and this time we had to utilise special software on top of a team junior moderators just to make sure everything got read and sifted through. They've nevertheless compiled a massive longlist, and we'll need to work through that before we can have a good sense of what this year's collection will look like, and we hope to keep the final manuscript to under 200 pages. So the approximate cost of producing an anthology will be (all costs in SGD):</p>
<p>1. Printing costs: ~$2500<br/>2. Design/Layout costs: ~$1000<br/>3. Marketing/Distribution costs: ~$500<br/>4. Administrative/Editorial Costs: ~$500<br/>5. Royalties: ~$2000 (~$20 per book x &lt;100 contributors??); we're giving out contributors' copies, not cash at this stage. Contributors retain all their rights.</p>
<p>Math Paper Press will be covering items 2 and 3, but in the community-driven spirit of SingPoWriMo, we're going back to Indiegogo to raise funds for this anthology and ease the financial burden off Math Paper Press / BooksActually, the little independent press / bookstore that could!</p>
<p>A cut will also go to Sing Lit Station, our newly-founded literary non-profit that organises SingPoWriMo, puts together the moderating team, and provides all the free food and booze at the parties, all with additional support from the Arts Fund this year (because we need it!!). Finally, if we do manage to raise more funds than expected, we want to give out copies of the anthology to schools and other places that can afford more exposure to local literature!</p>
<h3>Why should I care?</h3>
<p>Because Sing Lit matters. Because you love all things to do with the making of books, the making of stories, the making of exquisite things with words alone. Because, for some strange reason, you feel inspired to write poetry of your own, but don't know how to go about doing it and making your own voice heard.</p>
<p>Because you just have a lot of spare cash lying around, and you want to throw it to a project whose editors and publishers are starving, like, literally. Because your friend is in the anthology and you know, yeah, you know.</p>
<p>Because there are young kids in schools who are made to think that literature is not important, not essential to our daily lives, and simply not fun at all to do or read or study. Because this book is testament that literature is all games and hard work and rainbows and the small miracles that happen when a good poem comes together. And because this book is about a thousand people, telling one another to have another go at this wonderful, frustrating, and yet altogether mind-defying smorgasm of a poetry challenge.</p>
<p>Because SingPoWriMo is not simply about you, or me – it's all about all of us, and that same yet strangely variegated language we all speak in: poetry.</p>
<h3>Alright alright, now tell me: what do I get for being awesome?</h3>

<p>Alexandru es uno de los miles
de jóvenes rumanos que salen de su país en busca de un camino más llano hacia
el futuro que siempre ha soñado. ¿Qué hay detrás de cada historia y de cada
persona que decide o se ve obligado a dejar su tierra, su gente, su presente,
para encontrarse con situaciones contradictorias y tener que construir una vida
nueva? ¿Empatizaremos con este ingeniero que un día llega a El Dorado español
y rompe con su pasado? </p>

Nos encontramos ante un
fenómeno cuya relevancia en la actualidad mundial no hace sino crecer: la
emigración. En épocas de bonanza, la mano de obra llegada de fuera es
bienvenida. Pero en los momentos en los que la crisis socioeconómica no parece
tener fin, con millones de refugiados y emigrantes que intentan encontrar su
lugar para vivir y trabajar, ¿seguimos pensando lo mismo? 
Alexandru es uno de los miles
de jóvenes rumanos que salen de su país en busca de un camino más llano hacia
el futuro que siempre ha soñado. ¿Qué hay detrás de cada historia y de cada
persona que decide o se ve obligado a dejar su tierra, su gente, su presente,
para encontrarse con situaciones contradictorias y tener que construir una vida
nueva? ¿Empatizaremos con este ingeniero que un día llega a El Dorado español
y rompe con su pasado? 
Haciendo un interesante repaso
de los eventos más recientes de su historia, Un pie entre dos mundos también
intenta dar a conocer facetas que descubran un país hermoso, con gente
hospitalaria, trabajadora y honrada. ¿Lo conseguirá?
¿Quiénes?Tandaia es
 una joven editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a 
autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes 
ideas como es el crowdfunding. De este modo eres tú, 
ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra

<p><b>Firenze è una città oramai totalmente bilingue</b>: parla in inglese al passato e in italiano al futuro, e viceversa: vive entrambe le lingue non come motivo di stretta necessità ma come motivo di scambio, di creazione, di condivisione, di formazione. Firenze riceve molto e costantemente, grazie al turismo, ai programmi di studio all’estero, e alle continue attenzioni internazionali, ma ora è arrivato il momento di dare. Il nuovo Rinascimento, se sarà, sarà bilingue e si estenderà ben oltre i confini della città. Firenze è la musa, ed esige la nascita di un movimento che riesca a coinvolgere non solo gli amanti dell’Italia ma anche gli italiani all’estero e i sostenitori delle arti di tutto il mondo.</p><p>Per raggiungere questo obiettivo, ecco che fa capolino all’orizzonte una <b>nuova rivista bilingue: The Florentine Literary Review.</b></p><p><b>TheFLR</b>: una rivista basata solidamente su racconti avvincenti, profondi e divertenti, più due poesie collezionabili per ogni numero. Testi e versi di autori italiani appariranno per la prima volta accompagnati da accurate traduzioni in lingua inglese, a cui si aggiungerà un ulteriore spessore artistico grazie alle illustrazioni per ogni numero, che saranno affidate alle visioni di un illustratore contemporaneo.</p><br/><h2>Perché TheFLR</h2><br/><p>TheFLR andrà a colmare un vuoto: si sente fortemente la mancanza di traduzioni in inglese di racconti italiani (così come testi integrali di letteratura italiana contemporanea), così necessari a promuovere la cultura italiana nel mondo.</p><p>Lettori e amanti della cultura italiana dispongono di un ventaglio assai limitato di autori, scelti più sulla base di scelte di mercato che sulla loro fedele rappresentazione della condizione contemporanea dell’Italia di oggi.</p><p>Professori di letteratura contemporanea Italiana che provano a insegnare la lingua, la cultura e le tematiche dell’Italia contemporanea in traduzione, riscontrano una grande difficoltà nel reperire e assegnare letture ai loro studenti. Pertanto questo magazine si inserirebbe idealmente da subito nell’elenco di letture delle scuole e delle università con questo tipo di corsi.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460478085/theflr_cover_illux_pfrafh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>(Mockup di copertina - Marco Badiani / illux Leo Cardini)</i><br/><br/><h2>Il formato di TheFLR</h2><br/><p>TheFLR sarà una rivista elegante pensata anche per collezionisti, un lavoro che racchiude opere di arte ed illustrazione, progettato con cura e stampato in Italia su carta di ottima qualità.

</ul><p><b>NUMERI</b>: Il numero Uno uscirà nell’Ottobre 2016. I numeri successivi usciranno quando pronti, o su richiesta, o quando le tempistiche e la stagione lo permetteranno. Una, due, dodici volte l’anno. I tempi della creatività hanno un ritmo tutto loro.</p><h2>I Temi di The FLR</h2><p>Ogni numero si apre con un tema unico. L’Autunno 2016 si aprirà per la rivista con il concetto di “invasione”, per ricordare una massiccia inondazione: quest’anno infatti cade il 50° anniversario dell’alluvione che nel 1966 sconvolse Firenze. La forza devastante di questo evento venne contrastata dall’unione tra italiani ed americani che, insieme a volontari di tutto il mondo, diedero vita ad una nuova era in città. Un momento storico che forse all’epoca avrebbe potuto generare movimenti contemporanei e collaborazioni (anche se forse questi processi si stanno attivando solo ora.)</p><p>Ma sopra la superficie (dell’acqua) e oltre, il concetto sarà esteso anche a temi quali il flusso del turismo, l’“invasione” di migranti ed immigrati, il viavai continuo tra culture e linguaggi differenti. Il concetto di invasione deve forse sempre avere una connotazione negativa?</p><br/><h2>TheFLR e la sua comunità</h2><p>La vita di una rivista non si limita alla stampa - ogni numero è solo una parte di un processo ininterrotto che include eventi, workshop e letture. Il tema verrà presentato il 30 Aprile 2016 durante un evento programmato all’interno della Notte Bianca a Firenze, che ospiterà un dibattito sul tema “Invasione” con gli autori prescelti e i curatori di TheFLR. Si prevede anche un evento di chiusura della campagna che sarà un modo divertente per distribuire la rivista ai sostenitori e al pubblico, con letture, DJ set e aperitivo (al momento previsto in data 28 Ottobre 2016 a Firenze). Nel frattempo non si esclude la progettazione di ulteriori eventi e workshop, ovunque ve ne sia la richiesta o la possibilità.</p><p>Durante le fasi di selezione, traduzione e sviluppo (interviste, copertura online, social media e promozione, in Italiano ed in inglese) la rivista si avvarrà dell’aiuto di studenti americani ed italiani. Il lavoro del traduttore diventa cruciale all’interno di questo processo e gli studenti approfondiranno il suo ruolo grazie ad una serie di incontri mirati.</p><h2>La squadra dietro TheFLR</h2><p>TheFLR è un progetto ideato da The Florentine, la rivista in lingua inglese che da undici anni copre le notizie di attualità fiorentina, in collaborazione con l’associazione Forward, concepita da Alessandro Raveggi e Valeria Farill. La qualità della rivista è assolutamente assicurata dal comitato editoriale e dalla presenza di un prestigioso comitato d’onore che verrà nominato in questi mesi. </p><p><b>Direttore</b> / Alessandro Raveggi (Firenze, italia 1980) Autore, studioso e docente di letteratura moderna italiana presso vari programmi e scuole americani di livello a Firenze.

Italiano
Firenze è una città oramai totalmente bilingue: parla in inglese al passato e in italiano al futuro, e viceversa: vive entrambe le lingue non come motivo di stretta necessità ma come motivo di scambio, di creazione, di condivisione, di formazione. Firenze riceve molto e costantemente, grazie al turismo, ai programmi di studio all’estero, e alle continue attenzioni internazionali, ma ora è arrivato il momento di dare. Il nuovo Rinascimento, se sarà, sarà bilingue e si estenderà ben oltre i confini della città. Firenze è la musa, ed esige la nascita di un movimento che riesca a coinvolgere non solo gli amanti dell’Italia ma anche gli italiani all’estero e i sostenitori delle arti di tutto il mondo.Per raggiungere questo obiettivo, ecco che fa capolino all’orizzonte una nuova rivista bilingue: The Florentine Literary Review.TheFLR: una rivista basata solidamente su racconti avvincenti, profondi e divertenti, più due poesie collezionabili per ogni numero. Testi e versi di autori italiani appariranno per la prima volta accompagnati da accurate traduzioni in lingua inglese, a cui si aggiungerà un ulteriore spessore artistico grazie alle illustrazioni per ogni numero, che saranno affidate alle visioni di un illustratore contemporaneo.Perché TheFLRTheFLR andrà a colmare un vuoto: si sente fortemente la mancanza di traduzioni in inglese di racconti italiani (così come testi integrali di letteratura italiana contemporanea), così necessari a promuovere la cultura italiana nel mondo.Lettori e amanti della cultura italiana dispongono di un ventaglio assai limitato di autori, scelti più sulla base di scelte di mercato che sulla loro fedele rappresentazione della condizione contemporanea dell’Italia di oggi.Professori di letteratura contemporanea Italiana che provano a insegnare la lingua, la cultura e le tematiche dell’Italia contemporanea in traduzione, riscontrano una grande difficoltà nel reperire e assegnare letture ai loro studenti. Pertanto questo magazine si inserirebbe idealmente da subito nell’elenco di letture delle scuole e delle università con questo tipo di corsi.(Mockup di copertina - Marco Badiani / illux Leo Cardini)Il formato di TheFLRTheFLR sarà una rivista elegante pensata anche per collezionisti, un lavoro che racchiude opere di arte ed illustrazione, progettato con cura e stampato in Italia su carta di ottima qualità. Ogni numero sarà corredato dalle immagini di un diverso illustratore. FORMATO:
64 pagine in quadricromia, 16x24cm
1 testo introduttivo in italiano ed inglese 
6 racconti in italiano / 6 traduzioni in inglese fatte da traduttori professionisti
2 poesie in formato da collezione (strappabile o sticker) / traduzione in inglese
Illustrazioni e layout creativo
Quando possibile, verrà proposto un “ARTVERTISING” integrato, che offre al cliente una forma di promozione creativa e permette al giornale di coprire i costi editoriali.
Tiratura 1000 copie, carta 140g

NUMERI: Il numero Uno uscirà nell’Ottobre 2016. I numeri successivi usciranno quando pronti, o su richiesta, o quando le tempistiche e la stagione lo permetteranno. Una, due, dodici volte l’anno. I tempi della creatività hanno un ritmo tutto loro.I Temi di The FLROgni numero si apre con un tema unico. L’Autunno 2016 si aprirà per la rivista con il concetto di “invasione”, per ricordare una massiccia inondazione: quest’anno infatti cade il 50° anniversario dell’alluvione che nel 1966 sconvolse Firenze. La forza devastante di questo evento venne contrastata dall’unione tra italiani ed americani che, insieme a volontari di tutto il mondo, diedero vita ad una nuova era in città. Un momento storico che forse all’epoca avrebbe potuto generare movimenti contemporanei e collaborazioni (anche se forse questi processi si stanno attivando solo ora.)Ma sopra la superficie (dell’acqua) e oltre, il concetto sarà esteso anche a temi quali il flusso del turismo, l’“invasione” di migranti ed immigrati, il viavai continuo tra culture e linguaggi differenti. Il concetto di invasione deve forse sempre avere una connotazione negativa?TheFLR e la sua comunitàLa vita di una rivista non si limita alla stampa - ogni numero è solo una parte di un processo ininterrotto che include eventi, workshop e letture. Il tema verrà presentato il 30 Aprile 2016 durante un evento programmato all’interno della Notte Bianca a Firenze, che ospiterà un dibattito sul tema “Invasione” con gli autori prescelti e i curatori di TheFLR. Si prevede anche un evento di chiusura della campagna che sarà un modo divertente per distribuire la rivista ai sostenitori e al pubblico, con letture, DJ set e aperitivo (al momento previsto in data 28 Ottobre 2016 a Firenze). Nel frattempo non si esclude la progettazione di ulteriori eventi e workshop, ovunque ve ne sia la richiesta o la possibilità.Durante le fasi di selezione, traduzione e sviluppo (interviste, copertura online, social media e promozione, in Italiano ed in inglese) la rivista si avvarrà dell’aiuto di studenti americani ed italiani. Il lavoro del traduttore diventa cruciale all’interno di questo processo e gli studenti approfondiranno il suo ruolo grazie ad una serie di incontri mirati.La squadra dietro TheFLRTheFLR è un progetto ideato da The Florentine, la rivista in lingua inglese che da undici anni copre le notizie di attualità fiorentina, in collaborazione con l’associazione Forward, concepita da Alessandro Raveggi e Valeria Farill. La qualità della rivista è assolutamente assicurata dal comitato editoriale e dalla presenza di un prestigioso comitato d’onore che verrà nominato in questi mesi. Direttore / Alessandro Raveggi (Firenze, italia 1980) Autore, studioso e docente di letteratura moderna italiana presso vari programmi e scuole americani di livello a Firenze. Tra le sue pubblicazioni si trovano il romanzo “Nella vasca dei terribili piranha” (Effigie, 2012), la raccolta di racconti “Il grande regno dell’emergenza” (LiberAria, 2016),  il saggio “Calvino Americano” (Le Lettere, 2012), la prima introduzione italiana a David Foster Wallace (Doppiozero, 2014) e il libro di poesia “La trasfigurazione degli animali in bestie” (Transeuropa, 2011), oltre ad una serie di testi pubblicati all’interno di importanti riviste italiane. Tra le sue numerose collaborazioni con giornali, è da sottolineare il suo romanzo a puntate “Romanzo da Spiaggia”, uscita in Italiano ed Inglese per Il Corriere della Sera.Consiglio Editoriale & Curatori / Giuseppe Girimonti Greco (traduttore), Raoul Bruni (critico e studioso), Vanni Santoni (scrittore e giornalista), Paolo Maccari (poeta e insegnante), Alessandro Raveggi (scrittore e studioso), Luca Baldoni (scrittore, traduttore e studioso), Diego Bertelli (poeta e studioso), Diego Bertelli (poeta e studioso), Martino Baldi (bibliotecario e poet), Daniele Pasquini (scrittore e giornalista), Niccolò Scaffai (critico e studioso)Editore/ The Florentine: con 11 anni di esperienza alle spalle nell’industria editoriale, ogni mese The Florentine dà alle stampe un giornale apprezzato e seguito da una vasta comunità internazionale di appassionati d’Italia, che oltre a leggere il cartaceo interagiscono giornalmente e generosamente con i canali online e social media della testata. Inoltre, la casa editrice The Florentine Press ha pubblicato almeno una dozzina di libri sull’arte e su cosa significa vivere in Italia.Autori / Selezionati ed invitati di volta in volta da Direttore, dal consiglio editoriale e curatori, gli autori verranno da tutta Italia.TheFLR costi 
Questa “invasione “bilingue, questo rinascimento, questa apertura della comunità italiana contemporanea verso il mondo anglofono potrà avvenire solo se risponde ad una necessità reale, un bisogno esistente. Noi crediamo che ci sia, e per questo abbiamo deciso di lanciare il magazine con una formula di pagamento anticipato su Indiegogo. La vendita di poche centinaia di copie ci darebbe la conferma della validità del progetto e ci permetterebbe di pianificare future edizioni.I nostri costi: onorari autori, traduzione professionale, illustrazioni, stampa: €4300

Keep in mind, we're just minutes away from Rocky Mountain National Park and some fantastic drives and sights to see, weather permitting.

Sorry for this, snow got us last year.

<h3>About Runes for Writers</h3>
<p>I'm passionate about Story. I believe stories have the power to transform lives and to help readers better understand themselves, their value, and their place in the world.</p>
<p>I've been writing fiction and studying various forms of esoteric and shamanic practices for more than 20 years. This project is an outgrowth of this experience, harnessing the divinatory power of the Norse Runes (Elder Futhark) for application to the writing process.</p>
<p>I created Runes for Writers to help writers (and storytellers in any medium) access their deepest levels of creativity, break through writer's block, and develop characters and stories that are deep, rich, and transformative.</p>
<p>The complete system will be comprised of rune cards, tiles, and dice, each of which can be used to solve specific challenges of writing and creativity. We're also developing an introductory booklet, full-length manual, runecasting notepads, and mobile app.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While independent book publishing has become more and more accessible, custom production of card and dice sets is a much more expensive project. Your generous funding will help us with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printing of custom Rune Cards and notepads</li>
<li>Production of custom Rune Dice</li>
<li>Laser-engraving of custom Rune Tiles</li>
<li>Publication of user's manual (print and digital)</li>
<li>Print and assembly of packaging</li>
<li>Publicity and promotional materials</li>
<li>Mobile app development (stretch goal)</li>
</ul>
<p>The target funding level of $15,000 is for an initial production run of 200 sets each of cards, tiles, and dice sets.</p>
<p>Perks include complete sets of the cards, tiles, and/or dice sets, print and digital materials, special limited-edition items (e.g., T-shirts), and consulting services. Depending on funding levels, more unique perks may be offered. Stay tuned!</p>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>A number of successful crowd-funding campaigns have been launched for Tarot cards. The Runes are comparable in use and power, though less well known than the Tarot.</p>
<p>As part of my efforts to get the word out, I'll be conducting blog tours and in-person workshops to help build a deeper base of interest.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whether or not you're able to contribute, you can help spread the word and generate interest in this project. Please share this campaign in your social media circles and among your writing community. If you are part of a critique group or other writer's organization, please contact me to arrange a workshop (in-person or online).</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>Spinning Threads is the story of a young girl who reluctantly flies down to a retirement community in Florida on a writing assignment for work. To her surprise, she becomes friends with one of the residents and not only learns her story, but also becomes involved in an adventure with elements of mystery and romance. Throughout this process, she also learns about herself. <br/><br/>My name is Maria and I am the author of Spinning Threads. I wrote this book because I’ve always wanted to write a creative fiction novel that explores the art of storytelling and incorporates elements of my great grandma’s out-of-this-world love story. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you’ll be more curious about other people’s stories, no matter how different they may be from your. This book can be an opportunity to think about how you connect with others and see, in the process, what you can learn about yourself. Through the mystery and romance sub-plots, you’ll find yourself cheering for my protagonist, Penelope, and learning alongside her the importance of listening to others to better understand yourself. <br/><br/>Penelope is a young woman who got her first job out of college at a luxury magazine in NY. For her first assignment, she is sent down to Naples, Florida to write an article on one of the residents at a retirement community. Although she’s at first reluctant to take on the assignment, Penelope finds herself developing a friendship with another resident in the community: Juliana. Through this friendship, Penelope gets involved in a mystery and a romance that changes the way she thinks about herself and her relationships with others. <br/><br/>As she learns to listen and not just hear, Juliana’s love story inspires Penelope. By allowing herself to care for her new friend, Penelope delves into an unsolved mystery in her past. As it becomes clear that this mystery is not contained to the past but rather still developing, Penelope finds herself playing a crucial role in its unravelling, consolidating a very profound friendship with Juliana and those involved in it. Moreover, she gains a new perspective on herself and starts rethinking her previous perspectives on life. <br/><br/>You will love this book if you’re interested in seeing characters develop meaningful, interpersonal connections through storytelling and the act of uncovering details about their past. You’ll love this book if you’re looking for a fun but also thought-provoking read that will have you invested in the protagonist and start asking questions about the relationships in your life.  <br/><br/>Spinning Threads speaks to both older and younger generations who want to delve into the concepts of intergenerational storytelling and self-discovery in a new way. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Spinning Threads inspires reflection and dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>How can the act of hearing other people’s stories, especially those you initially think are uninteresting, help you better understand yourself?</li>
<li>Young people think old people have antiquated beliefs, and old people think the young ones lack empathy and are too individualistic. How often are these beliefs furthered by confirmation biases and, hence, hampering meaningful intergenerational connections?</li>
<li>People talk a lot about diversity in gender or race, but not as much in age. Why is it important to include people from all generations in contemporary dialogue?</li>
</ul>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe that discussing the power of intergenerational storytelling to foster empathy and lead to self-discovery will change us all for the better. <br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<p>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April, 2021.</p>
<ul>
<li>The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this upcoming Spring!</li>
</ul>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.</li>
<li>Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.</li>
<li>You will receive early access to the Author’s Note and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.</li>
<li>You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.</li>
<li>You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.</li>
<li>And much more!</li>

<h2>About the Author</h2>Maria Suarez is an Emory University BBA and Creative Writing graduate who’s now working at Azul Arc, a digital design and software development firm in Atlanta as a Marketing and Product Manager associate. <br/><br/>After hearing her great-grandmother’s out-of-this-world love story, unlike any contemporary modern romance story, and seeing the power of intergenerational storytelling to bring generations together, she was inspired to write this book. Moreover, she’s always had a passion for hearing and reading stories as a means to understand other people’s realities, so she’s always wanted to write a novel that can transport readers from all walks of lives into the world of her protagonist. <br/><br/>Maria has a big sweet tooth and she loves exploring new coffee shops with friends and family.

<p><strong>Lo que no te conté</strong> es un thriller acerca del pasado que se cierne amenazador sobre un personaje en continuo descubrimiento de quién es y de dónde procede.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Jorge regresa a su pueblo para pasar unos días junto a su padre, y se encuentra por accidente con el diario oculto de Alicia, su madre, a la que perdió siendo un crío. Su lectura le permite descubrir que toda su vida se cimienta en una gran mentira, marcada por un crimen del que fueron cómplices seres queridos, empujándolo hacia una búsqueda obsesiva de una verdad sepultada en el olvido.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Una historia sobre la determinación de aquellos que buscan desagravio para los que ya no pueden luchar por sí mismos. Un crisol de misterio, aventura, crimen, amor.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia </strong>es una joven editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el <i>crowdfunding</i>.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy se nos presenta <strong>Alberto Puyana</strong>.</p>
<p>Nací en Cádiz en el convulso 1974, y crecí entre programas de TV de <i>Alfred Hitchcock presenta</i> y las <i>Historias para no dormir </i>de Chicho Ibáñez Serrador. Siendo adolescente, descubrí a Poe, HP Lovecraft, Stephen King y Clive Barker, de ahí posiblemente mi pasión por la literatura de misterio. Tanto para leer como para escribir.</p>
<p>Fruto de esta inquietud por la creación narrativa y de mis experiencias de pasillo por distintos hospitales, publiqué en el año 2012 mi primera novela, <i>El Preticante</i>, que sin embargo es una sátira basada en anécdotas reales… un humilde homenaje a otro de los escritores que me marcaron: Tom Sharpe.</p>
<p> A partir de entonces, me atreví a probar suerte en el mundo de los concursos literarios, consiguiendo hasta ahora 25 premios por toda la geografía española y varias publicaciones en distintas antologías de relato, publicadas por distintas editoriales.</p>
<p>Colaboro cada semana como columnista de opinión del periódico <i>La Voz del Sur</i> desde 2015.</p>
<p><i>Lo que no te conté</i>, mi segunda novela (esta que te presento), fue semifinalista del Premio Ateneo Ciudad de Valladolid de Novela en el año 2013, y es mi primera incursión en la ficción novelada de misterio.</p>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 840€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cuarenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.</li>
<li>Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.</li>
</ul>
<p>Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de <i>Lo que no te conté</i> que saldría pocas semanas después a la venta.</p>
<h3>Además...</h3>
<p>Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y <strong>Alberto Puyana</strong> vea publicada su obra.<br/><br/>Gracias por vuestro tiempo.</p>

<h3>Why does the world need this book?</h3>
<p>If this recent lockdown experience has taught us anything it's that the world is going crazy. Many have lost trust in experts and just don't know what to believe any more.</p>
<p>People hurl links at each other on social media like ninja stars and there are so many 'alternative facts' that the truth gets lost along the way.</p>
<p>There are many debunking and fact checking websites out there but only hard-core skeptics visit them. The language of science is often inaccessible and dismissive to the uninitiated.</p>
<p>So I want to write Science For Hippies to provide a simple, friendly guide to what science and critical thinking are all about. The book will explore the scientific method, cognitive biases, the uses and limits of intuition and address common concerns about funding and credibility.</p>
<p>The book won't offer detailed breakdowns of why individual conspiracy theories aren't true. No one likes to be told why they're wrong (and especially not in detail!).  Instead we'll look at how can we know anything at all? Not <i>what</i> to think but <i>how.</i></p>
<p>And that can help make the world a better place to live in.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why raise money for this book?</h3>
<p>I'll be honest: I thought I'd sooner sell a kidney than do a crowdfunding campaign. I find it excruciatingly awkward to ask anyone for money.</p>
<p>I'm an experienced writer, however, and think that I can write a book that's worth reading. So here you can order your copy of the book in advance and I have something to live on in the meanwhile.</p>
<p>The truth is, however, I'll write the book whether I reach the target or not - it will just take a lot longer!</p>
<p>And if there's momentum behind this campaign then I can also make videos and podcasts to accompany the chapters. There will also be a blog where you can see the ongoing work and I'd like this to be the seed for a movement to reconcile science with spirituality.</p>
<p>To be honest, if you're already the kind of person who reads science of a regular basis this book won't teach you much. But don't you know 1 or 2 (or 50!) people who could really do with learning the basics?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why should I write Science For Hippies?</h3>
<p>I used to believe a lot of...interesting things.</p>
<p>But then I read and read and read and discovered that amazing superpower that science bestows: the ability to change my mind. I learned to recognise the flaws in own thinking and learned how science makes the world a more magical place, not less.</p>
<p>I've written 5 books and so I know how to create structure and narrative, how to edit and craft a bunch of thoughts and stories into something worth reading. And I've already written a lot about alternative culture.</p>

<h3>Romero Travels to University of Central Florida</h3>
<p>Help spoken word artist David A. Romero get to his first out of state college gig(s)!</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a proud Pocho/Chicano spoken word artist based out of Diamond Bar, CA. I have opened for Ozomatli and am the second artist to have been featured on All Def Digital, a YouTube channel from Russell Simmons.</li>
<li>UPDATE: CHAMPLAIN COLLEGE in Burlington, Vermont will be my first out of state college appearance! The University of Central Florida will be my second. For more than 6 years now, I have been developing myself as a spoken word artist. About 3 years ago, I started performing at colleges in Southern California and receiving honorariums for my performances. Many, including family members, have told me that my dreams of becoming a professional spoken word artist were impractical. This summer was rough (as it was for many spoken word artists) and I have found myself without the necessary funding to make it out to this first out of state appearance. That's why I need your help: to make this first big step towards regularly touring as a professional poet.</li>
<li>I pride myself on the fact that I booked these shows without an agency and without a manager. I'm just a simple guy from Diamond Bar. I spent hours this summer compiling lists of college contacts. I put my own EPK together and trained myself how to build my own website. Some may consider me a dreamer, but I assure you, I'm also a grinder and have worked hard to get this booking and will work hard to get the funds necessary to make this trip. Funds generated from these college appearances will go towards funding my next trips. I hope to book even more out of state gigs! The goal is to become self-sufficient from here on out. Long-term goals include the formation of a scholarship for Latino students with an interest in film-making and/or spoken word.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Hey, where is this money going to anyways?</h3>
<p>""If you don't know where you come from, how're you supposed to know where you're going?""</p>
<ul>
<li>Airfare (rounds up to about $500), hotel (rounds up to about $400). I may also need to pay for cab fare to get to my hotel and to the University from the hotel ($100+). Plus, extra costs always come up. This site also takes a cut. You know how it is. I assure you though, I'm looking to book cheap and will not be spending your hard-earned dollar on any frivolities (did I mention that I'm almost two years sober?).</li>
<li>Here are your perks:</li>
<li>$5: NEW PERK: A ""I &lt;3 Cheese Enchiladas"" 1"" mini button (Any public donor for $5 or more gets this too!)</li>
<li>$10: I'll take a picture at the University of Central Florida before the show starts with a paper that says ""Thank You (Your Name)"" and email it to you! (Any public donor for $10 or more gets this too!)</li>
<li>$20: You get a handwritten thank you card with a unique short poem in there just for you!</li>
<li>$50: A copy of Voices of Highland Park (a poetry book that came out of a workshop series for middle school and high school students I participated in. I edited and designed the book!) Also, you get a full poem dedicated to you included in a handwritten thank you card.</li>
<li>$75: A signed copy of Diamond Bars: The Street Version or Fuzhou, my first two books of poetry. You also get the full poem written for you in the handwritten thank you card.</li>
<li>$100: Signed copies of Diamond Bars: The Street Version and Fuzhou. You might also get a copy of Ellendale Night (my third book of poetry, supplies limited). You get a full poem written for you, or for a loved one. I will memorize the poem and record a performance if you'd like! Then, I will upload it onto the YouTube and you can share it with your friends and family!</li>
<li>$200: A signed Cheese Enchiladas or Diamond Bars: The Street Version poster. You also get signed copies of Diamond Bars: The Street Version and Fuzhou. You get the full poem, memorized by me and uploaded onto the YouTube.</li>
<li>$500: You get a personal appearance from me at your party, college, whatever! I'll perform 30-60 minutes for your enjoyment! Unfortunately, this only applies to supporters in SoCal. If you're not in SoCal, and would still like to donate this amount, you will get 3 poems written and memorized by me and uploaded onto the YouTube. Best thing is, these 3 poems can be on a topic of your choosing! Woohoo! You also get everything that was listed before and I'll think of some other stuff to throw in.</li>
<li>Every single bit of the funds I raise will be used to fund my trip. The more I am able to get from you supporters, the less I will have to try to get from a bank or from another financial institution. Due to the fact that my credit is in bad shape, this will be helpful indeed.</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Any money raised over the campaign goal will go towards funding future trips.</span></li>

Help spoken word artist David A. Romero get to his first out of state college gig(s)!

I'm a proud Pocho/Chicano spoken word artist based out of Diamond Bar, CA. I have opened for Ozomatli and am the second artist to have been featured on All Def Digital, a YouTube channel from Russell Simmons.
UPDATE: CHAMPLAIN COLLEGE in Burlington, Vermont will be my first out of state college appearance! The University of Central Florida will be my second. For more than 6 years now, I have been developing myself as a spoken word artist. About 3 years ago, I started performing at colleges in Southern California and receiving honorariums for my performances. Many, including family members, have told me that my dreams of becoming a professional spoken word artist were impractical. This summer was rough (as it was for many spoken word artists) and I have found myself without the necessary funding to make it out to this first out of state appearance. That's why I need your help: to make this first big step towards regularly touring as a professional poet.
I pride myself on the fact that I booked these shows without an agency and without a manager. I'm just a simple guy from Diamond Bar. I spent hours this summer compiling lists of college contacts. I put my own EPK together and trained myself how to build my own website. Some may consider me a dreamer, but I assure you, I'm also a grinder and have worked hard to get this booking and will work hard to get the funds necessary to make this trip. Funds generated from these college appearances will go towards funding my next trips. I hope to book even more out of state gigs! The goal is to become self-sufficient from here on out. Long-term goals include the formation of a scholarship for Latino students with an interest in film-making and/or spoken word.



Hey, where is this money going to anyways?
""If you don't know where you come from, how're you supposed to know where you're going?""

Airfare (rounds up to about $500), hotel (rounds up to about $400). I may also need to pay for cab fare to get to my hotel and to the University from the hotel ($100+). Plus, extra costs always come up. This site also takes a cut. You know how it is. I assure you though, I'm looking to book cheap and will not be spending your hard-earned dollar on any frivolities (did I mention that I'm almost two years sober?).
Here are your perks:
$5: NEW PERK: A ""I <3 Cheese Enchiladas"" 1"" mini button (Any public donor for $5 or more gets this too!)
$10: I'll take a picture at the University of Central Florida before the show starts with a paper that says ""Thank You (Your Name)"" and email it to you! (Any public donor for $10 or more gets this too!)
$20: You get a handwritten thank you card with a unique short poem in there just for you!
$50: A copy of Voices of Highland Park (a poetry book that came out of a workshop series for middle school and high school students I participated in. I edited and designed the book!) Also, you get a full poem dedicated to you included in a handwritten thank you card.
$75: A signed copy of Diamond Bars: The Street Version or Fuzhou, my first two books of poetry. You also get the full poem written for you in the handwritten thank you card.
$100: Signed copies of Diamond Bars: The Street Version and Fuzhou. You might also get a copy of Ellendale Night (my third book of poetry, supplies limited). You get a full poem written for you, or for a loved one. I will memorize the poem and record a performance if you'd like! Then, I will upload it onto the YouTube and you can share it with your friends and family!
$200: A signed Cheese Enchiladas or Diamond Bars: The Street Version poster. You also get signed copies of Diamond Bars: The Street Version and Fuzhou. You get the full poem, memorized by me and uploaded onto the YouTube.
$500: You get a personal appearance from me at your party, college, whatever! I'll perform 30-60 minutes for your enjoyment! Unfortunately, this only applies to supporters in SoCal. If you're not in SoCal, and would still like to donate this amount, you will get 3 poems written and memorized by me and uploaded onto the YouTube. Best thing is, these 3 poems can be on a topic of your choosing! Woohoo! You also get everything that was listed before and I'll think of some other stuff to throw in.
Every single bit of the funds I raise will be used to fund my trip. The more I am able to get from you supporters, the less I will have to try to get from a bank or from another financial institution. Due to the fact that my credit is in bad shape, this will be helpful indeed.
Any money raised over the campaign goal will go towards funding future trips.

<p><em>“Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 330px;"">The World Health Organization</p>
<p>Imagine a world where feeling good, being healthy and living a happy life is normal. Now with the right knowledge it is possible for all of us to have this future because proper nutrition and some minor lifestyle changes can make it possible.</p>
<p>This book is a comprehensive guide to Total Health which is achieved when the mind, brain, and body are in a state of balance that allows the body to prevent or cure disease and disorder. It examines the science of the mind, nutrition, and health and its relationship to personal development, human behavior, and emotional well-being.</p>
<p>Filled with sound scientific evidence from more than 25 years of research conducted by the Global Peace Project and more than 150 years of work by the world's leading minds in science and medicine, Total Health Solutions will shatter your perception of what it means to live a happier, healthier, wealthier life and give you the knowledge, understanding, and power to change your life for the better forever. </p>
<p>The lies propagated by the Food Industrial Complex, the Medical Industrial Complex, the FDA, and the media are exposed. You will learn the truth about what it takes to break the hypnotic trances that block your ability to achieve total health, wealth, and happiness. You will see how we are captive to the global chemical, food, and drug industries and how we are addicted to dangerous chemicals, food additives, and pharmaceutical drugs that promote disease and death.</p>
<p>The human race has suffered for 10,000 years from chronic malnutrition. This book teaches you why and how we are deficient in nearly every essential nutrient we need to sustain life and provides proof, based in part on the research findings of a group of scientists and medical experts known as the ""Miracle Men"" who’s findings are featured in the 1936 U.S. Senate Document 264 and the research of Dr. Abram Hoffer and two-time Nobel Prize winner Dr. Linus Pauling who declared that all human disease and disorders are caused by mineral deficiencies.</p>
<p>My research reveals the link between lifestyle behavior and brain damage for people suffering from substance abuse, chronic stress, and obesity. You will see the biological links between stress and disease and you will understand the nature of what scientists are calling the second brain in our digestive system. The saturated fat/low fat myth and the vegetarian myth are debunked and the truth about fad diets is examined, explaining why virtually all weight loss efforts fail, and the enormous health benefits of meditation, visualization, and yoga are explored. </p>
<p>The nature of the subconscious mind and the role it plays in the hypnotic trances that control our health and well-being in our daily life is explained and I show you how your thoughts can change your genes, create disease and emotional disorders. The power of the placebo effect and the mind's incredible ability to heal the body, the brain, and achieve meaningful success in life is revealed.</p>

<h1><strong>Who Will Benefit From This Book?</strong></h1>
<p>Total Health Solutions is for everyone who has ever dreamed of being happy, healthy, and living a rich and fulfilling life. Everyone who's tried to change their life and failed because they hit a wall of resistance within themselves and everyone who has suffered with fear, depression, loneliness, fatigue, poor health, failed relationships, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and a wide range of emotional, spiritual, and health issues will benefit from this project.  I wish I could've had a book like this 40 years ago when I first started to deal with my own personal challenges and the social, emotional, and health issues of the people I've dedicated my life to serving. </p>
<p>Most of the information available on the subject of optimal health, personal success and well-being is false and misleading and the truth about the real health crises has been kept from the public for more than 100 years. It's almost impossible for people who need the correct information and solutions to find them. Although this knowledge has been known for a very long time it has been hidden from all of us who suffer and need it the most. </p>
<h1><strong>Where Will Your Money Go?</strong></h1>
<p>Your financial support is needed to finish the writing and to hire an editor, public relations support, and a designer to create the cover and the poster. The potential of this book to benefit the lives of millions of people means that it must not be allowed to fail. I desire to see this book become a bestseller since that would reach and benefit the greatest number of people. </p>
<p>This project will take about six months to bring to completion and be published in both electronic and physical form. Your support will be making an enormous contribution to yourself and countless others. </p>
<h1><strong>How To Contribute</strong></h1>
<p>If you are able to, please pledge to support this project and help make it a reality. On the right of the screen, you'll find a range of pledges from $5 to $10,000, with different rewards for each. To pledge to this project, just click the red “Contribute Now” button on this page.

<h3>Project Summary: kanere.org</h3>
<p>Kanere newspaper is based in Kakuma refugee camp, advocating for refugee rights. Kakuma has existed for over 20 years and houses nearly 120,000 refugees, with many waiting over 15 years for resettlement. Located in the remote desert, life is tough and opportunities are scarce. Started by exiled journalists, Kanere is an independent refugee-run newspaper that advocates for refugee rights, which are in short supply. Kanere's achievements are extensive, its resources are not. Kanere: </p>
<ul>
<li>Provides a window into refugee life for the world outside of Kakuma, advocating for improving the plight of refugees globally</li>
<li>Advocates for refugee rights in Kakuma, which has led to improved refugee services, water access, security and many other camp improvements</li>
<li>Provides training and opportunities for journalists and youth</li>
<li>Shares information between camp residents, raising awareness about current issues, promoting social cohesion and inspiring refugees</li>
</ul>
<p>This campaign is to raise money to support Kanere in their push to achieve a better deal for refugees. The Kanere team is hard working, passionate and inspirational, despite their lack of resources. They have one old laptop (most work is on paper), erratic electricity/internet, no office and they all work on a voluntary basis. This is where you step in - a small amount of money goes a long way in Kakuma. Please support Kanere so they can improve their advocacy for refugee rights and improve the lives of Kakuma residents and refugees globally.</p>

Somos Daniela Guglielmetti (ilustradora) y Ma. Gabriela Lovera (escritora) y nos hemos reunido nuevamente para crear un libro infantil ilustrado. Se trata de un compendio de descripciones de 22 duendes caseros distintos, esos que habitan en los rincones más recónditos de una casa y que muchas veces pasan desapercibidos para la mayoría de los humanos, sobre todo los adultos.<br/><i><br/><b>ENGLISH:</b><br/>We are Daniela Guglielmetti (illustrator) and Ma. Gabriela Lovera (writer), and we have gathered once more to create an illustrated children's book full of fantasy and wit. It is a book with descriptions of 22 different household elves, those that live in the most hidden corners of a house, and most of the times go unnoticed by humans, especially adults.</i><br/><br/><b>Más del libro /<i>Read more about the book: </i></b><a href=""http://duendescaseros.blogspot.com.es/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://duendescaseros.blogspot.com.es/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://duendescaseros.blogspot.com.es/</a><br/>

<h3>El libro / <i>The book</i><br/>
</h3>
<b>Pequeño gran tratado de duendes caseros</b><br/>(Reg. M-003959/2013)<br/><p>Es cierto que mucho se ha editado sobre duendes en general, pero poco se conoce de aquéllos que se circunscriben al ámbito doméstico, esos que se esconden tras los objetos más cotidianos: una tostadora, un enchufe, un felpudo, una maceta.<br/>El libro va de ellos y se compondrá de la descripción de 22 duendes caseros cada uno con su entrada específica en la cual se describe el lugar donde habita, así como algunas de sus costumbres y rasgos de carácter más curiosos. Podría decirse que es una especie de compendio ilustrado cuyo fin es acercar al lector a una materia tan poco estudiada, pero no por ello menos importante: la <i>Duendelología</i> de lo casero. Todo esto con sumo rigor humorístico.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/998402/files/20141109035104-labels_cita_ojo_aguja_duendes.jpg?1415533864"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i><b>ENGLISH:</b><br/><b>Grand Tiny Treatise of Household Elves</b><br/>(Reg. M-003959/2013)<br/>It is true that much has been published about elves in general, but little is known of those who are confined to the domestic sphere. Thanks to these curious creatures, Gabriela and Daniela have been able to bring out the magic that lies behind everyday objects:  toasters, plugs, doormats, flowerpots... With that unique perspective, they will recreate the world of these tiny beings to bring it to you as lively and bright as possible.<br/>The Treatise will include detailed descriptions of 22 elves. Each one of them having an especific entry in which the author describes their dwelling place, as well as some of their most curious traits of character. The book could also be considered an illustrated compendium aimed to interest the reader in a little known subject: </i>Household Elvesology<i>. All this done with the utmost humorous rigor.</i><br/><br/><b>¡SO MUCH FUN AHEAD OF US!</b><br/><br/>

Bienvenidos / Welcome
Somos Daniela Guglielmetti (ilustradora) y Ma. Gabriela Lovera (escritora) y nos hemos reunido nuevamente para crear un libro infantil ilustrado. Se trata de un compendio de descripciones de 22 duendes caseros distintos, esos que habitan en los rincones más recónditos de una casa y que muchas veces pasan desapercibidos para la mayoría de los humanos, sobre todo los adultos.ENGLISH:We are Daniela Guglielmetti (illustrator) and Ma. Gabriela Lovera (writer), and we have gathered once more to create an illustrated children's book full of fantasy and wit. It is a book with descriptions of 22 different household elves, those that live in the most hidden corners of a house, and most of the times go unnoticed by humans, especially adults.Más del libro /Read more about the book: http://duendescaseros.blogspot.com.es/

El libro / The book

Pequeño gran tratado de duendes caseros(Reg. M-003959/2013)Es cierto que mucho se ha editado sobre duendes en general, pero poco se conoce de aquéllos que se circunscriben al ámbito doméstico, esos que se esconden tras los objetos más cotidianos: una tostadora, un enchufe, un felpudo, una maceta.El libro va de ellos y se compondrá de la descripción de 22 duendes caseros cada uno con su entrada específica en la cual se describe el lugar donde habita, así como algunas de sus costumbres y rasgos de carácter más curiosos. Podría decirse que es una especie de compendio ilustrado cuyo fin es acercar al lector a una materia tan poco estudiada, pero no por ello menos importante: la Duendelología de lo casero. Todo esto con sumo rigor humorístico.

ENGLISH:Grand Tiny Treatise of Household Elves(Reg. M-003959/2013)It is true that much has been published about elves in general, but little is known of those who are confined to the domestic sphere. Thanks to these curious creatures, Gabriela and Daniela have been able to bring out the magic that lies behind everyday objects:  toasters, plugs, doormats, flowerpots... With that unique perspective, they will recreate the world of these tiny beings to bring it to you as lively and bright as possible.The Treatise will include detailed descriptions of 22 elves. Each one of them having an especific entry in which the author describes their dwelling place, as well as some of their most curious traits of character. The book could also be considered an illustrated compendium aimed to interest the reader in a little known subject: Household Elvesology. All this done with the utmost humorous rigor.¡SO MUCH FUN AHEAD OF US!

Eller vill du ge tillbaka för det du redan fått?</p><p><i>Stöd mig så att jag kan hjälpa fler!</i></p><h3>Vad Jag Behöver &amp; Vad Du Får</h3><p>De senaste tre åren har jag på heltid hjälpt människor att växa och leva ett liv i passion. På flera olika sätt har jag inspirerat, utbildat, coachat och stöttat. Av mina klienter och följare har jag fått mängder av bevis på att jag lyckats med det jag vill ge. Men ska jag vara ärlig så är det en sak jag inte varit fullt lika grym på - och det är att tjäna pengar. Jag har bränt igenom mina sparpengar till förmån för att peppa, boosta och utbilda. Så jag har inte en stor buffert att ta av, att skriva en bok tar mycket arbetstid och är inte kostnadsfritt. Därav behöver jag din support! </p><p>Det jag specifikt kommer använda pengarna till är: </p><ul>
<li>Korrekturläsning, sättning, redigering</li>
<li>Bokcoach</li>
<li>Tryckning</li>
<li>Illustrationer</li>
<li>Omslagsdesign </li>
</ul><h3></h3><p>Pengarna går först och främst till att få ett så färdigt innehåll som möjligt, så får jag inte in hela summan så gör jag klar bokens insida så mycket jag kan. Får jag in mer pengar så går de till marknadsföring och bokagent. Och till att göra en ännu fetare releasefest som alla som donerat får komma på! </p><p>Det finns så många nivåer att hjälpa mig på och du kan få allt från en kram, en signerad bok till en heldag med mig i San Francisco! Till höger finner du alla olika varianter. Hoppas de gör dig lika taggad som mig. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/671133/files/20140624025854-header_kontakt.jpg?1403603934"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span></span></p><h3></h3><h3>Längtan</h3><p>Jag vet att denna boken är efterfrågad, alla frågor jag får varje vecka visar på att det finns ett stort behov. Människor längtar efter att ta steget och leva ett liv som passar bättre ihop med deras inre värderingar.</p><p>Jag har länge bloggat, skrivit artiklar, instagrammat och facebookat. Delat med mig av ord för att inspirera och få människor att växa och våga. Nu är det dags att ta nästa steg. Att skapa en samling av visdomar, fakta och inspiration. En bok som hjälper till och stöttar. Som får dig att våga skapa och leva ditt drömliv. Jag längtar efter att få skriva den.</p><h3>Vem är Sanne?<span><br/></span>

Eller vill du ge tillbaka för det du redan fått?Stöd mig så att jag kan hjälpa fler!Vad Jag Behöver & Vad Du FårDe senaste tre åren har jag på heltid hjälpt människor att växa och leva ett liv i passion. På flera olika sätt har jag inspirerat, utbildat, coachat och stöttat. Av mina klienter och följare har jag fått mängder av bevis på att jag lyckats med det jag vill ge. Men ska jag vara ärlig så är det en sak jag inte varit fullt lika grym på - och det är att tjäna pengar. Jag har bränt igenom mina sparpengar till förmån för att peppa, boosta och utbilda. Så jag har inte en stor buffert att ta av, att skriva en bok tar mycket arbetstid och är inte kostnadsfritt. Därav behöver jag din support! Det jag specifikt kommer använda pengarna till är: 
Korrekturläsning, sättning, redigering
Bokcoach
Tryckning
Illustrationer
Omslagsdesign 
Pengarna går först och främst till att få ett så färdigt innehåll som möjligt, så får jag inte in hela summan så gör jag klar bokens insida så mycket jag kan. Får jag in mer pengar så går de till marknadsföring och bokagent. Och till att göra en ännu fetare releasefest som alla som donerat får komma på! Det finns så många nivåer att hjälpa mig på och du kan få allt från en kram, en signerad bok till en heldag med mig i San Francisco! Till höger finner du alla olika varianter. Hoppas de gör dig lika taggad som mig. LängtanJag vet att denna boken är efterfrågad, alla frågor jag får varje vecka visar på att det finns ett stort behov. Människor längtar efter att ta steget och leva ett liv som passar bättre ihop med deras inre värderingar.Jag har länge bloggat, skrivit artiklar, instagrammat och facebookat. Delat med mig av ord för att inspirera och få människor att växa och våga. Nu är det dags att ta nästa steg. Att skapa en samling av visdomar, fakta och inspiration. En bok som hjälper till och stöttar. Som får dig att våga skapa och leva ditt drömliv. Jag längtar efter att få skriva den.Vem är Sanne?

</div></div>","BANDSTAND DIARIES                       THE BOOK YOU'VE WAITED OVER 50 YEARS TO READ!  Turn back the clock to the late 1950s and early 1960s. You were probably one of the 20 million-plus teenagers and adolescents who rushed home from school to watch the early days of American Bandstand . And, no matter where you lived in the USA, you had a loving connection with the local Philadelphia Regulars who danced on Dick Clark's daily music variety show. Remember these familiar names: Arlene and Kenny, Bob and Justine, Pat Molitierri, Frani Giordano, Carole Scaldiferri, Flossie Harvey, Billy Cook, Joe Fusco, Myrna Horowitz, the Jiminez sisters, Harvey Robbins, Janet Hammill, Arlene DiPietro, etc. We have interviewed over 40 of the living legends and pay Tribute to many more who linger in our memory with love in this beautiful coffee-table book, BANDSTAND DIARIES; The Philadelphia Years 1956 to 1963,  which will be published this Summer.As Bandstand fans, you probably copied the Regulars' fashions, hair styles, dance steps or followed  their latest fads. You eagerly read gossip about them in teen magazines; joined one or more of their personal fan clubs across the country; and mobbed them like movie stars whether they were sipping sodas at Pop Singer’s Luncheonette or appearing at sock hops or concerts.After American Bandstand  moved to Los Angeles, the Philadelphia Regulars basically faded from daily sight on television, yet our fascination and special memories about them continued until today.Now, finally, there will be the book that you’ve waited over 50 years to read. It’s called BANDSTAND DIARIES: The Philadelphia Years 1956 to 1963. But first, we need each of you who want to own a copy of this to join our pre-publishing campaign.So here's the scoop...We are the three authors of BANDSTAND DIARIES                     Arlene Sullivan: I was a Regular in the mid-1950s. It sometimes seems unbelievable that fans still recognize me after all these years.  My personally written Diary in BANDSTAND DIARIES includes many revealing stories about my life that you didn't read in the teen magazines. ""I have been blessed living a very public and, at the same time, private life.  I share both in this wonderful book.""                         Ray Smith: I was an occasional dancer on American Bandstand during its Philadelphia heyday. I also am a co-author of Dick Clark and American Bandstand.  In Bandstand Diaries, ""I write about the Bob Horn days, Dick Clark's contributions to pop and cultural history and my own observations watching the show from the bleachers or dancing the occasional jitterbug.""                          Sharon Sultan-Cutler: I was one of those middle school kids who couldn't wait to watch American Bandstand and all the Regulars every afternoon. ""I am the lucky Bandstand fan and  co-author who has interviewed over 40 Regulars for this book during the last three years. Sometimes I feel like pinching myself because I feel so blessed to be part of this long-awaited book.""                                            THE IMPACT OF OUR BOOKThe Regulars have done their share to transform American Pop and Cultural history between the late 1950s and early 1960s. As television’s first reality stars, they shaped the way teenagers were portrayed from questionable to respectable.They danced their way into our hearts, minds and living rooms and made rock 'n' roll mainstream. The Regulars could make or break a record during the Rate a Record Segment. No matter what they did, whatever they did  mattered to  us fans who grew up alongside these teenagers through the black-and-white television screen.Although the niche audience for BANDSTAND DIARIES has grown up into our baby boomer and senior years, this coffee-table book will serve as a historical and cultural reminder of life in the  mid-20th century for readers of all ages. It is truly the book millions of fans have been waiting over 50 years to read!      HERE IS WHAT WE NEEDOur BANDSTAND DIARIES Indiegogo Crowdfunding Campaign is creating a community of fans like you  who are helping us to professionally publish this once-in-a-lifetime book. Your support shows that you care about keeping those special memories alive just as we do. And as many of you already know, we've been researching and writing this book (as well as collecting hundreds of photographs)  for well over three years now. It's our labor- of- love book project which we believe thousands of you will want to have in your library of books. We certainly hope so.For many of you, this will be your first Crowdfunding Campaign. However, there have already been  thousands of projects including books, movies, products and services that have been completed or financed through the backing and beliefs of Crowdfunding participants like you. Just ask your kids or grand kids who are Millenials or from Generations X or Y!Our initial goal  is to raise  $20,000  through this 30-day Campaign, solely to pay the upfront costs of designing, editing and printing this full color coffee-table book. That basically means we only need around 600 books pre-ordered.  We believe we all can meet that goal in a matter of days with your support and encouragement. The co-authors hope you will also spread the word within your own social media pages (Facebook, Twitter,etc.) plus emailing a note to Bandstand fans who would benefit from knowing about the Campaign. There will also be a Banner which you can share to link friends up directly with the campaign.Our Project Manager, Sharon Woodhouse, has provided us with the following estimated  budget for BANDSTAND DIARIES.Our Editorial Team (Copyeditor, Proofreader, Indexer)  $3000Our Design Team (Cover, Interior, Photo Adjuster)  $3,300Printing    $9,000Project Manager & Crowdfunding Specialists    $2000ISBN #s    $250  (necessary for libraries, bookstores, etc.)Legal & Accounting     $1,500Website     $1,500Once that goal is met, BANDSTAND DIARIES becomes a reality and it will be published by mid-Summer.After we reach our goal during the campaign, the authors will use additional funding to print more books, hire additional staff to help pay for social media, publicity, shipping fees, and fulfillment to ship the books to our readers. All your Crowdfunding contributions reward money will go right back into the publishing and promotion process itself. And we all know that budgets can change at any moment.We will keep you posted on our Campaign progress  through our Facebook page posts, Tweets on Twitter, and our website blog at www.BandstandDiaries.com . After all, we're all in this together.         HERE IS HOW YOU CAN HELPWe call our most popular backer reward The Jitterbug. It is the Collectors’ Limited Edition copy of BANDSTAND DIARIES, autographed by Arlene Sullivan. It retails for $35 and is available only during our 30-day Indiegogo Campaign.How would you like your name to be featured in the book itself?  When you sign up in the next few days, we'll be glad to have your name listed as a Contributor to BANDSTAND DIARIES.  That Perk usually comes at the $100 Reward Level (a three-pack), but we want as many of you as possible to take early advantage of our Campaign. And who doesn't want to see their names in light?After the 30-day Campaign is completed, we will be selling the second edition in the future. It's the same exact book, but it won't be the Collectors' Limited Edition.                                         FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION AT ANY LEVEL

voluntarios particulares y anónimos, de diversos grupos- o de
ninguno, que se ha reunido en este sector para trabajar e iniciar la
reconstrucción de manera inmediata tras el incendio del pasado 13 de
abril. 

<p>
</p><p>El objetivo
de nuestro proyecto consiste en construir al menos 9 viviendas, para
familias del “Pasaje Los Buenos Vecinos”. Estas construcciones
contarán con la estructura siguiente: Cabañas de 6 x 3 mts (media
agua) montadas sobre pilotes; base de piso en pino de 2x3 ; piso de
terciado de 15mm, paneles de pared de 2x2, techo de zinc, interior
Volcanita, exterior Permanit, ventanas y puertas. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hasta ahora,
hemos contado con algunas donaciones y aportes materiales de
particulares así como con el apoyo de centros de acopio, amigos y
vecinos para armar los paneles de pared, nivelar los terrenos,
instalar e impermeabilizar los pilotes. Además de instalar baños
secos, ayudar con la limpieza general del sitio, acercarse a la
comunidad y evaluar las necesidades particulares del momento.  
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cabe decir,
que el trabajo que se viene es abundante y arduo, pero confiamos en
que, con el equipo que se ha constituido “in situ”, la
experiencia de sus miembros (trazadores, carpinteros, coordinadores,
universitarios, bodegueros, encargados de residuos, y muchos más) su
energía y voluntad, podremos lograr nuestro objetivo. Para eso, es
imprescindible que sigamos recibiendo aportes para conseguir los
materiales de construcción que faltan. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hemos
convocado y nos hemos encontrado con unos 50 voluntarios de
Valparaíso, San Antonio, Santiago, Chiloé, Argentina, La Ligua,
Canadá, España, etc. que han hecho su aporte de diversas maneras al
proyecto; removiendo escombros, limpiando, instalando viviendas
temporales con materiales reciclados, preparando y nivelando los
terrenos, coordinando, informándose e informando al vecindario,
consiguiendo materiales y aportes financieros, etc. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Al enfocar
nuestra energía en un sector determinado del desastre, sentimos que
podemos hacer una diferencia significativa en las condiciones de vida
de esas personas y familias al proveerlas con una vivienda que les
permita estar protegidos del invierno que se acerca. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cabe
insistir en que nosotros no pertenecemos a ninguna institución,
grupo u organización. Somos anónimos, anónimos que se han unido
ante la catástrofe porque no han podido ni han querido quedarse de
brazos cruzados. Individuos que han decidido tomar la pala, el hacha
y el chuzo para ayudar, aunque sea un poco, a la gente de los cerros
de este puerto querido. <br/></p><p>Las donaciones obtenidas serán destinadas a comprar los materiales que nos faltan: techos, revestimientos interiores y exteriores, ventanas, puertas y suelos.</p><p>Para aquellos que no puedan hacer un aporte económico, pueden ayudarnos corriendo la voz y compartiendo el enlace de este proyecto.<br/></p>
<p>
</p><u><b></b></u><p>
</p><p>En nombre de
todos los que NO ELIJEN DONDE VIVIR, le agradecemos de antemano su
generosidad y compromiso con la causa.

voluntarios particulares y anónimos, de diversos grupos- o de
ninguno, que se ha reunido en este sector para trabajar e iniciar la
reconstrucción de manera inmediata tras el incendio del pasado 13 de
abril. 


El objetivo
de nuestro proyecto consiste en construir al menos 9 viviendas, para
familias del “Pasaje Los Buenos Vecinos”. Estas construcciones
contarán con la estructura siguiente: Cabañas de 6 x 3 mts (media
agua) montadas sobre pilotes; base de piso en pino de 2x3 ; piso de
terciado de 15mm, paneles de pared de 2x2, techo de zinc, interior
Volcanita, exterior Permanit, ventanas y puertas. 


Hasta ahora,
hemos contado con algunas donaciones y aportes materiales de
particulares así como con el apoyo de centros de acopio, amigos y
vecinos para armar los paneles de pared, nivelar los terrenos,
instalar e impermeabilizar los pilotes. Además de instalar baños
secos, ayudar con la limpieza general del sitio, acercarse a la
comunidad y evaluar las necesidades particulares del momento.  


Cabe decir,
que el trabajo que se viene es abundante y arduo, pero confiamos en
que, con el equipo que se ha constituido “in situ”, la
experiencia de sus miembros (trazadores, carpinteros, coordinadores,
universitarios, bodegueros, encargados de residuos, y muchos más) su
energía y voluntad, podremos lograr nuestro objetivo. Para eso, es
imprescindible que sigamos recibiendo aportes para conseguir los
materiales de construcción que faltan. 


Hemos
convocado y nos hemos encontrado con unos 50 voluntarios de
Valparaíso, San Antonio, Santiago, Chiloé, Argentina, La Ligua,
Canadá, España, etc. que han hecho su aporte de diversas maneras al
proyecto; removiendo escombros, limpiando, instalando viviendas
temporales con materiales reciclados, preparando y nivelando los
terrenos, coordinando, informándose e informando al vecindario,
consiguiendo materiales y aportes financieros, etc. 


Al enfocar
nuestra energía en un sector determinado del desastre, sentimos que
podemos hacer una diferencia significativa en las condiciones de vida
de esas personas y familias al proveerlas con una vivienda que les
permita estar protegidos del invierno que se acerca. 


Cabe
insistir en que nosotros no pertenecemos a ninguna institución,
grupo u organización. Somos anónimos, anónimos que se han unido
ante la catástrofe porque no han podido ni han querido quedarse de
brazos cruzados. Individuos que han decidido tomar la pala, el hacha
y el chuzo para ayudar, aunque sea un poco, a la gente de los cerros
de este puerto querido. Las donaciones obtenidas serán destinadas a comprar los materiales que nos faltan: techos, revestimientos interiores y exteriores, ventanas, puertas y suelos.Para aquellos que no puedan hacer un aporte económico, pueden ayudarnos corriendo la voz y compartiendo el enlace de este proyecto.


En nombre de
todos los que NO ELIJEN DONDE VIVIR, le agradecemos de antemano su
generosidad y compromiso con la causa.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

  What We Need & What You Get 
I need a little over $10,000 in total, but I'm trying to raise at least half so I can start hiring editors, hire an illustrator, and pay for all the other small fees that add up to crazy amounts.  I feel as though my project is unique because the book looks at crime/drama from a different angle and has several plot twists and surprises.  If I don't reach my goal, I plan on using the money for an editor and illustrator and hopefully find other ways to earn the rest.  
  The Impact 
Looking from your perspective, you would help people who love to read fiction add another book to read to their list.  I have success in fundraising, like a fundraiser I did for breast cancer and another for the music programs in schools. This is the first fundraiser I have done for my own dreams/needs.  
  Risks & Challenges 
The obstacles are piling up like crazy.
1st obstacle: age and experience; However, due to my writing experience, starting when I was 9, I can show publishers I have the drive and passion.  2nd obstacle: finding an interested party; currently I'm constantly searching for someone with interest and with your help I will push through the wall and find the interest.

<ul>
<li>During three years of research and two years of

     history of European Yiddish theatre. While this theatre tradition is
     rather young at less than 150 years old, it is extraordinarily rich and
     diverse, spanning both sides of the Atlantic. My book is about the

     only half of the grant, this is simply not enough.</li>
<li>My publisher, Professor Janusz Degler from The

Impact</b></p>
<p>The big question of my book is to see if
Yiddish-language theatre is still visible in Europe beyond the deep depths of

of the theatres which still perform in Yiddish (for example: Jewish State

conclusion, that Yiddish theatre as a form of art might have some chance of

<h3>What's Happening ...</h3>
<p>The decades of ignoring the fine arts scene outside Annapolis, Md., are over.</p>
<p>Anne Arundel Arts Backstage is a comprehensive, all-inclusive, NON-PROFIT website dedicated to showcasing all the different and unique arts offered throughout all of Anne Arundel County, and not only in Annapolis.</p>
<p>Anne Arundel County is home to 500,000 people, many of whom are painters, musicians, dancers, poets, actors, chefs, comics, promoters and venue owners and operators.</p>
<p>Jake Linger, former sports editor for the <em>Bowie Blade-News</em> and currently a writer and community editor for <em>The Capital</em> and <em>Crofton-West County Gazette</em>, and a blogger for Rams Head Group, founded Anne Arundel Arts Backstage. Linger has recruited several writers and photographers to join the team.</p>
<p>Anne Arundel Arts Backstage will offer an interactive experience for the user via online and mobile app. Anne Arundel Arts Backstage staff will not only write about and provide professional photography for concerts by local and national musicians, festivals and gallery showings, but also write enterprising stories and profiles about who these artists are, whether established like Jimi Davies (aka Jimi Ha-Ha) from national recording group Jimmy's Chicken Shack or up and coming such as Kennedy Cole, a Crofton eighth-grader who owns her own art-making business, Kennedy's Krafty Kreations.</p>
<p>For instance ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Does Annapolis guitarist Kajun Kelly have a day job?</li>
<li>Why does guitarist and Creating Communities founder Rob Levit care so much about philanthropy?</li>

<p>However, business owners will want to see a completed product prior to spending less available advertising dollars on an unproven outlet. The initial fundraising goal of $3,000 will be spent on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional grade laptop (including necessary software)</li>
<li>Development and maintenance of <a href=""http://www.aaartsbackstage.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.aaartsbackstage.com</a>

<h3>The Impact of Contributors ...</h3>
<p>People in Anne Arundel County need and want their first outlet dedicated to the local arts and the artists. There are Facebook and Twitter campaigns, but no official virtual home.

<div>Little Freddie King is one of the last great country bluesmen in New Orleans. In the mid-1950s, as a teenager, he hopped a freight train south from McComb, Mississippi to escape the hard life of a sharecropper. He taught himself to play guitar by buying 45 rpm records and listening to them at 33 rpm, then found work performing at the city's corner nightclubs, including one notoriously nicknamed the Bucket of Blood. There, he learned to dive behind the Rock-Ola jukebox every time the bullets started flying. King played on weekends and fixed car alternators by day. He was scrappy and drank hard for much of his adulthood. In the 1980s, his wife stabbed and shot him in a jealous rage. Forced by his injuries to quit drinking, he underwent the transformation into the man he is today: a quiet, modest gentleman who still plays a hard-driving ""gutbucket"" blues. </div>

<i><b>Was ist das Land der Hoffnung</b></i><i><b>?</b></i>
</h1><p><b>希望の国とは？</b></p>
<br/><p>Some years ago, I performed 
as a soloist with the San Francisco Ballet, and during my time backstage
 I took on a huge creative project that lasted nine years - to turn a 
blank square meter piece of fabric into a beautiful landscape using the 
art of needlepainting, or embroidery. The finished piece, pictured 
below, shows a spectacular world where humans and nature lived in 
perfect harmony with one another. I called it Land of Hope, as it 
depicts what I believe the world could be like if we empower ourselves 
and our children to do good. </p><p><i>Während der Zeit, die ich als Solist des San Francisco Ballet hinter der Bühne bei Proben und Warten verbrachte, begann 
 ich ein Projekt, das letztlich neun Jahre dauerte: ich begann ein 
Einquadratmeter großes Stück Stoff lückenlos und mit Reliefs mit sehr 
dünnen Fäden zu besticken. Langsam entstand eine Märchenlandschaft, in 
der Menschen, Tiere und Fabelwesen in Harmonie miteinander und mit der 
Natur leben. So entstand das ""Land der Hoffnung"", von dem ich glaube, 
das es möglich ist, wenn wir und unsere Kindern sich dafür entscheiden.</i></p><p>何年も前の事ですが、サンフランシスコバレエ団でソリストとして踊っていた頃、私は舞台裏で待っている間９年の歳月をかけ、大掛かりなプロ
ジェクトを手掛けました。それは、一枚の無地の生地に「ニードルペインティング」（刺繍）で、美しい風景を描くものでした。出来上がった作品は、下の写真
でご覧いただける通り、自然と人間が完全に調和して暮らす素晴らしい世界を描いています。それは、大人も子どもも皆が良い行いをしたら世界はきっとこんな
風になるだろうと私が信じる「希望の国」を表現しています。</p><p>After leaving the ballet, my wife 
and I opened our own dance studio in Berlin. Over the years, we have 
watched many of our students grow from small children into beautiful, 
flourishing women and men with strong values of friendship, courage, and
 helpfulness. Inspired by their positive influences in the world, we 
wish to create a multilingual children's story book intended to empower 
even more children to grow as our students did and make the world a 
better place. Our book, based on the Land of Hope tapestry, would use 
close-up images taken from the needlepainting artwork to tell a story of
 how to grow up to be a strong person by encouraging children to respect
 others, have courage, and be helpful, along with many other important 
lessons.</p><p><i>Nachdem
 ich das Ballett verliess, zog ich nach Berlin und schloss mich meiner 
Frau an, die dort ein Tanzstudio betrieb. Im Laufe der Jahre wurden wir 
Zeugen, wie aus kleinen Ballettschülern Erwachsene wurden, die als junge
 Männer und Frauen mit Werten wie Freundschaft, Mut und 
Hilfsbereitschaft lebten. Dies inspirierte mich zu der Idee eines 
Kinderbuches, das eine mehrsprachiges Geschichte erzählt. Und vielleicht
 andere Kinder beeinflusst ebenfalls andere zu respektieren, mutig und 
liebevoll zu sein, und die welt zu einem besseren Platz zu machen. Als 
Hintergrund benutze ich Nahaufnahmen des Needlepainting Werkes Land of 
Hope.</i></p><p>
バレエの世界を離れた後、私は妻と共にベルリンにスタジオを開きました。そこで私達は、子どもだった生徒達が友情、勇敢、誠実さを大切にする、輝きにあふ
れた大人へと成長し羽ばたいて行く姿を目の当たりにしました。社会で活躍する彼等の姿に私は強く心を動かされ、更に多くの子ども達に、私の生徒達の様に成
長して、より良い世界を作ってほしいと願うようになり、多言語の絵本を作ろうと決心しました。この絵本は、「希望の国」の刺繍のイメージを用いて、人を敬
う事、勇気を持つ事、人に親切に接する事といった大切な人生のレッスンが、子ども達の素晴らしい成長に結びついていくということを物語っています。</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/704932/files/20140709070256-1_The_Land_of_Hope.jpg?1404914576"" src="""" style=""""/></p><blockquote>
<p>Land der Hoffnung, Landschaftsbild mit filigranen Details
</p>
<p>The completed Land of Hope, a full landscape in astonishing detail.

</p>
<p>「希望の国」の全貌</p>
</blockquote><h1><b>The Story</b></h1><h1><b><i>Die Geschichte</i></b></h1><p><b>あらすじ</b></p>
<br/><p>The
 story focuses on Pepito, a man smaller than a blade of grass. He is 
envious of those around him who are big and strong, and his greatest 
wish is to be like them. He falls asleep one day and wakes up in the 
Land of Hope, where he meets many fascinating creatures. He asks each of
 them how he can become big and strong like them. </p>
<p>One after 
another, each character gives suggestions to help him become a better 
person, such as having respect for others, giving a helping hand where 
needed, having courage in tough situations, and so on. In the end, 
Pepito realizes that having a big heart is more important than having a 
big body, and that even if he is small he can still make great changes 
in the world. </p>
<p><i>Die Geschichte erzählt von Pepito, einem Männlein klein wie ein Grashalm .
 Er ist neidisch auf alle um ihn herum, die groß und kräftig sind, er 
wünscht sich ebenso zu sein. Eines tages erwachte er im Land der 
Hoffnung und trifft dort viele
 faszinierende Wesen. Er fragt jeden, wie er denn groß und stark werden 
könne. Einer nach dem anderen gibt einen Rat und macht Vorschläge, um 
ihm zu helfen. Z.B. Respekt für andere zu haben, anderen in der Not zu 
helfen oder Mut in schwierigen Situationen zu beweisen und so weiter. Am
 Ende versteht Pepito, dass es wichtiger ist ein großes Herz als einen 
großen Körper zu haben, und dass auch ein kleines Männlein große Dinge 
in der Welt bewirken kann!</i></p>
<p>主人公は、芝生の草よりも背の低いペピートです。彼は、周りにいる大きくて強い男の人たちに憧れています。ペピートの一番の願いは彼等のよ
うに強くてたくましくなる事です。ある日、ペピートが目覚めると、彼は希望の国にいました。そこで彼は、風変わりで素敵な住人たちに出会う度に、どうした
ら強く、大きくなれるか尋ねました。</p>
<p>希望の国の住人達は、ペピートの問いかけに、他者に敬意を持って接する事、困った人を助ける事、困難な状況でも勇気を持って立ち向かう事など様々な
助言をくれました。最後にペピートは、身体が大きいことより、大きな心を持つ方が大事だということ、自分がどんなに小柄でも世の中を大きく変えられるんだ
という事に気がつきました。</p>

<p>
オーラシオが描いたペピートのスケッチ。このようなイメージを絵本の所々に描いて、子ども達に楽しんでもらおうと思っています。絵本のレイアウトに関しては、下記をご覧下さい。</p>
<h1><b>Why is this so important? </b></h1>
<h1><b><i>Warum ist dieses Buch wichtig?</i></b></h1>
<p><b>このプロジェクトの重要性</b></p>
<br/><p>It is
 our belief that children cannot get enough positive influences in their
 growing years, so that they can become adults with good values to live 
by. When we raise a child to be good and compassionate, we bring more 
positive energy into the world. It's no secret that there are issues 
that exist around the globe that keep some people from living the best 
life they could have, and by teaching our next generations to be 
compassionate and helpful, we create a force for good that could, with 
time, bring peace to this world. The more we encourage children to have 
strong positive values, the closer we come to bringing the Land of Hope 
off the canvas and into reality.</p>
<p><i>Wir
 glauben fest daran, dass Kinder garnicht genug positive Einflüsse bei 
ihrer Erziehung erfahren können, um später als Erwachsene ein festes 
Fundament an positiven Glaubenssätzen zu haben. Jedes Kind, das zu 
Mitgefühl erzogen wird, wird selber immer einen positiven Beitrag in 
seinem Leben leisten. Die Welt ist vielerorts in Aufruhr, es gibt 
weltweit ernste Probleme. Da ist es wichtig, den Kindern liebevolle 
Energie und Erziehung zu geben, damit die Welt zu mehr Frieden und 
liebevollem Miteinander findet. Umso mehr Kinder starke positive 
Wertvorstellungen haben, umso eher kann aus dem Land of Hope Realität 
werden!</i></p>
<p>今
の子ども達は、正しい価値観を持つ大人へと成長する課程において、良い影響を与えられる機会が減っているのではないかと感じています。私たち大人が、思い
やりと正しい心をもつ子どもを育てることができれば、世界にもっと有益な変化をもたらし、社会に貢献できると考えています。今、世界ではさまざまな問題が
起きていて、本来なら手にできるはずの幸せな生活を送れない人々がいます。将来をになう子ども達に、人に対する思いやりを育くみ、大切さを教え伝えること
ができたら、きっといつか、それが世界の平和につながっていくに違いないと考えます。子ども達に強い正義感や前向きに生きていくすばらしさを伝えることが
できたら、この「希望の国」を布の上の刺繍の世界から現実のものに近づけることができるはずです。</p>
<p>We
 are also aiming to make this book multilingual, for two main reasons: 
1) We want Pepito's journey to be accessible to children all over the 
world, not just in English-speaking countries, and 2) exposing children 
to foreign languages at an early age helps them gain an interest in 
other cultures, which helps them develop the ideas of empathy and 
cooperation.  These go well with the other values presented in this 
book, and are especially helpful in our modern global world. Our base 
goal is for English and German, and we are working with a Japanese 
translator. Perhaps another language could be added if there is
 enough space and interest. We will keep you up-to-date on any 
developments.</p>
<p><i>Unser
 Ziel ist es, das Buch mehrsprachig heraus zu geben. Das hat mehrere 
Gründe, zum einem kann so Pepitos Geschichte in vielen Ländern gelesen 
und verstanden werden, zum anderen lernen Kinder 
von klein auf, dass es verschiedene Sprachen und Kulturen gibt, deren 
Unterschiedlichkeit wertfrei und selbstverständlich ist. Das ist in der 
globalen Welt von heute sicher von Vorteil. Im 
Moment gibt es die geschichte auf deutsch und englisch, eine japanische 
Übersetzung ist in Planung, auch andere Sprachen können hinzu gefügt 
werden, je nach Platz und Interesse. Wir halten Sie über die Entwicklung auf dem Laufenden,</i></p>
<p>私は、次に挙げます二つの理由でこの絵本を多国語で出版したいと考えています。まず一つ目は、英語圏だけでなく、世界中の子ども達にペピー
トの冒険を楽しんでもらいたいと思っています。そして二つ目は、子ども達には早くから外国語に触れる機会を与え、自国とは異なる文化に興味を持ち、他者に
対する共感や、協調性を養う事に役立ててほしいと思うからです。</p>

以上二点は、この絵本から学んでもらいたい他の大切な価値観とともに、子ども達がグローバル化が進む現代社会を生きていくために、非常に役立つものだと考
えます。　先ずは、英語、ドイツ語で出版する事が目標ですが、現在、日本語への翻訳も検討中です。賛同・支援して下さる方がいれば、その他の言語への翻訳
も検討したいと思っております。当プロジェクトの進展については、随時ご報告申し上げます。<br/>
<h1><b>What We Need</b></h1>
<h1><b><i>Was wir brauchen</i></b></h1>
<p><b>皆様のご支援のお願い</b></p>
<br/><p>Land
 of Hope has already been fully written, and we are already working with
 a German publishing company, S. Fischer Verlage, to get it out into the
 world. They have given us a price estimate of 7,000 Euro as an absolute
 minimum for production. It's a greater amount than we can afford to pay
 out-of-pocket, which is 
why we are turning to you for help! Every dollar or euro counts. </p>
<p><i>Das

 Land der Hoffnung ist bereits fertig geschrieben, und wir sind in 
Kontakt mit einem deutschen Verlagshaus (S. Fischer Verlage). Dort hat 
man uns einen Mindestpreis von 7 500 € für Druck und Vertrieb genannt. 
Leider fehlt uns das nötige geld, so wenden wir uns an Sie - jeder noch 
so kleine Betrag hilft. </i></p>
<p>「希望の国」の原稿は、既に出来上がっており、ドイツの出版社、S. Fischer 
Verlageから、絵本を世に送りだす準備を進めています。しかし、出版には、最低でも7,000ユーロの出資を要します。これは、私が個人的に用意で
きる金額を上回るものです。そのため、ぜひ皆様のご支援を頂ければと、今回お願いしております次第です。ご賛同いただきご支援を賜ることができましたら幸
いです。</p>
<p>However,
 our ultimate goal is €13,000 - that would cover editing, printing, 
production, grade-A advertisement, shipping and distribution to 
bookstores around the country, and would also upgrade the book into a 
larger, more child-friendly format. We've read the statistics on 
successful crowdfunding projects and know that a lower number is easier 
to reach, so we're hoping your generosity will go above and beyond our 
minimum goal to help us reach €13,000.</p>
<p><i>Das
 ultimative Ziel sind 13 000 €, was ausser Druck und allen damit 
verbundenen Kosten wie Versand und Vertrieb eine Top-Grade-A- 
Werbeaktion mit einschliesst. Das Buch könnte so 
auch ein etwas größeres, kinderfreundlicheres Format bekommen. Wir haben
 uns über erfolgreiche Crowdfunding-Projekte informiert und hoffen sehr,
 dass wir es schaffen, die optimale Summe zu erzielen. </i></p>
<p>上記の金額は、出版に最低限必要な額であり、編集、印刷、製本、広告、発送、国内外への書籍流通・販売、そして、子ども達にとって親しみや
すい大きめのサイズ、読みやすいフォーマットにするなど、多少の工夫を加えますと、必要経費は13,000ユーロ程度になると概算しております。目標金額
を低めに設定したほうがプロジェクトの成功率が高いという統計を目にしたこともありますが、わたし達としましても、皆様の温かいご支援をいただき、子ども
達のためにより質の高い絵本を届けることができるよう、努力を惜しまない所存です。</p>
<p>Even if you can't 
contribute monetarily to Land of Hope, you can still help us out by 
spreading the word to anyone who may be interested! Sharing, emailing, 
tweeting, and word-of-mouth are absolutely invaluable to getting this 
project off the ground.</p>
<p><i>Wenn
 Sie im Moment finanziell nicht helfen können, freuen wir uns, wenn Sie 
helfen, indem Sie andere auf das Projekt aufmerksam machen, die 
vielleicht helfen können. Soziale Netzwerke, Emails, Kaffeklasch, 
Mundpropaganda, all dies trägt dazu bei, das Projekt zu verwirklichen. </i></p>
<p>「希
望の国」に金銭的なご支援を頂けない場合でも、是非、このプロジェクトの事をお知り合いの方々へ伝えていただけたら幸いです。　情報のシェアリング、E
メールやツイッターを介して、又は、直接お話して頂くだけでも、このプロジェクトの実現に向けて非常にありがたい支援となります。</p>
<p> This book is perfect for parents of young
 children, expecting parents, or even aunts, uncles, grandparents, and 
other relatives searching for a gift for the young ones in their lives. </p>
<p><i>Dieses
 Buch ist ein schönes Geschenk für Eltern kleiner Kinder, also Eltern, 
Tanten, Onkel, Omas und Opas, Familie und Freunde- hier ist ein Geschenk
 für Eure  kleinen Lieblinge!</i></p>
<p>この絵本は、幼いお子様のご両親、もうすぐ生まれてくるお子様を心待ちになさっているご夫婦はもちろん、おじ様おば様、おじい様おばあ様、親戚の方々にとって、身近にいる大切なお子様達への特別なプレゼントににぴったりだと思います。</p>

<p><b>想定タイムライン</b></p>
<br/><p>So, how long is this all going to take? </p>
<p><i>So, wann wird was passieren?</i></p>
<p>このプロジェクトのタイムスケジュールは、どの様なものでしょうか。</p>
<br/><p>In a perfect world, the timeline would look something like this:</p>
<p><i>Wenn alles klappt, sieht der Plan aus wie folgt:</i></p>
<p>想定しているタイムスケジュールは、以下の通りです。</p>
<br/><p>October 31st, 2014: Crowdfunding begins!</p>
<p>Mid-December
 2014: Crowdfunding ends, all funds calculated, collected, and sent to 
publishers. Digital perks sent to supporters - just in time for the 
holidays!</p>
<p>January 2015: Publishing company begins production process for Land of Hope</p>
<p>Summer 2015: Printing is completed, books sent to Horacio and later distributed to bookstores</p>
<p>Summer/Fall 2015: Physical rewards shipped out to supporters, arriving once again just in time for the holidays!</p>
<p><i>31. Oktober 2014: das Crowdfunding beginnt!<br/>
Mitte Dezenber 2014: das Crowdfunding endet, alle Spenden gehen an den 
Verlag, die digitalen Perks (Belohnungen)  gehen an die Spender, 
pünktlich zum Weihnachtsfest!<br/>
Januar 2015: der Verlag beginnt die Produktion.<br/>
Sommer 2015: der Druck ist fertig, die Bücher werden versendet und an Buchläden verschickt.<br/>
Sommer/Herbst 2015: alle nicht-digitalen Perks , d.h. alle Geschenke werden verschickt, pünktlich zum nächsten Fest!</i></p>
<p>2014年10月31日：クラウドファンディング開始！</p>
<p>2014年12月中旬：クラウドファンディング終了。支援額の計算、出版社に送金。支援者への特典中、ネット上送信できるものは、クリスマス前にお届けします！</p>
<p>2015年1月：出版社「希望の国」絵本制作開始</p>
<p>2015年夏期：印刷・製本終了。オーラシオの手元に本が届けられ、いよいよ書店流通へ。</p>
<p>2015年夏・秋期：デジタル以外の特典を支援者様へ郵送。</p>
<p>Realistically, we know lots of things could happen to 
delay this process. If the crowdfuding isn't as successful as we hope, 
it may take some extra time to scrape up the last bit of money needed to
 pay the publishers. Printing may take longer than expected at the 
publishers, and mailing speeds can sometimes be unpredictable, 
especially internationally and around holidays. We can't know ahead of 
time what might happen, but we promise to keep you informed of all 
updates, good and bad, as soon as we find out about them. </p>
<p><i>Es können immer Dinge passieren, die den Ablauf verzögern. Wenn z.B. das
 Crowdfunding nicht den gewünschten Erfolg hat. kann es noch
 dauern, bis wir den Rest zusammen gekratzt haben. Der Druck kann läner 
dauern, Versandzeiten können abweichen (vor allem international). Falls 
eine Verzögerung eintritt, werden alle benachrichtigt sobald wir davon 
Kenntnis haben.</i></p>
<p>以上は、あくまでも想定しているタイムラインであり、現実的には、様々な原因でプロセスに遅れが出る可能性が考えられます。例えば、当キャ
ンペーン中に集められた支援金が目標額を下回った場合、残りの必要な額を集めて出版社に送金するのに時間がかかったり、印刷が予想以上に長引いたり、郵
送、特にホリデー・シーズン中の海外郵送に時間がかかる事など考えられます。このの様な状況に変更があり次第、責任を持って皆様に随時ご報告致します。</p>
<br/><h1>How it Will Look</h1>
<h1><i>Wie wird das Buch aussehen?</i></h1>
<p><b>完成した絵本</b></p>
<br/><p>We are envisioning our book to be approximately 22 x 1 x 30
 centimeters. Each turn of the page will reveal a beautiful photograph 
from the Land of Hope tapestry, with a corresponding text (in at least 
two languages) on the other side that tells Pepito's story. Small 
sketches of the little man in various poses will appear alongside the 
text.</p>
<p><i>Wir planen das Buch in der Größe 22
 x 1 x 30 cm. Bei jedem Umblättern sieht man eine neue Seite mit einem 
Bildausschenitt des Werkes ""Land der Hoffnung"" zeigen mit den dazu 
gehörigen Texten in mindestens zwei Sprachen auf der gegenüberliegenden 
Seite. Kleine Zeichnungen des kleinen Pepito ergänzen das Bild.</i></p>
<p>完成した絵本は、22cm x 1cm x 30cm

<br/><br/><p>'To his great surprise Pepito met a man who was even smaller then he was.</p>
<p>Pepito said to him: “How can you be happy being so very small?”</p>
<p>And the small man answered: “Because I see that life is full of treasures like this pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.”</p>
<p>“Yes”, said Pepito, “I see. But I want to be big.”</p>
<p>“Good,"" said the small man, “then you must respect all persons 
whether they are smaller or bigger than you; then you will be big. Come 
with me to the pond for a drink.”'</p>

ペピートはびっくりして目を丸くしました。

<p>ここには、僕より小さい住人がいたなんて！</p>
<p>「どうしてそんなに小さくても幸せでいられるの？」ペピートは、尋ねました。</p>
<p>「それは、この虹の果てにある黄金の壷の様な宝ものが、人生には、たくさんあるからだよ。」と応えました。</p>
<p>「へぇ。そうなんだ。」「でもね、ぼくは、大きくなりたいんだ。」</p>
「そうか。」その小さな住人は言いました。「それなら、自分より大きい人でも、小さい人でも、誰に対しても敬意をもって接することだな。そうしたら君は大きくなれるさ。ほら、一緒に池のほうにいって何か飲もうじゃないか。」<br/><br/><h2><b>Perks</b></h2><p><b>特典</b></p>

Was ist das Land der Hoffnung?
希望の国とは？
Some years ago, I performed 
as a soloist with the San Francisco Ballet, and during my time backstage
 I took on a huge creative project that lasted nine years - to turn a 
blank square meter piece of fabric into a beautiful landscape using the 
art of needlepainting, or embroidery. The finished piece, pictured 
below, shows a spectacular world where humans and nature lived in 
perfect harmony with one another. I called it Land of Hope, as it 
depicts what I believe the world could be like if we empower ourselves 
and our children to do good. Während der Zeit, die ich als Solist des San Francisco Ballet hinter der Bühne bei Proben und Warten verbrachte, begann 
 ich ein Projekt, das letztlich neun Jahre dauerte: ich begann ein 
Einquadratmeter großes Stück Stoff lückenlos und mit Reliefs mit sehr 
dünnen Fäden zu besticken. Langsam entstand eine Märchenlandschaft, in 
der Menschen, Tiere und Fabelwesen in Harmonie miteinander und mit der 
Natur leben. So entstand das ""Land der Hoffnung"", von dem ich glaube, 
das es möglich ist, wenn wir und unsere Kindern sich dafür entscheiden.何年も前の事ですが、サンフランシスコバレエ団でソリストとして踊っていた頃、私は舞台裏で待っている間９年の歳月をかけ、大掛かりなプロ
ジェクトを手掛けました。それは、一枚の無地の生地に「ニードルペインティング」（刺繍）で、美しい風景を描くものでした。出来上がった作品は、下の写真
でご覧いただける通り、自然と人間が完全に調和して暮らす素晴らしい世界を描いています。それは、大人も子どもも皆が良い行いをしたら世界はきっとこんな
風になるだろうと私が信じる「希望の国」を表現しています。After leaving the ballet, my wife 
and I opened our own dance studio in Berlin. Over the years, we have 
watched many of our students grow from small children into beautiful, 
flourishing women and men with strong values of friendship, courage, and
 helpfulness. Inspired by their positive influences in the world, we 
wish to create a multilingual children's story book intended to empower 
even more children to grow as our students did and make the world a 
better place. Our book, based on the Land of Hope tapestry, would use 
close-up images taken from the needlepainting artwork to tell a story of
 how to grow up to be a strong person by encouraging children to respect
 others, have courage, and be helpful, along with many other important 
lessons.Nachdem
 ich das Ballett verliess, zog ich nach Berlin und schloss mich meiner 
Frau an, die dort ein Tanzstudio betrieb. Im Laufe der Jahre wurden wir 
Zeugen, wie aus kleinen Ballettschülern Erwachsene wurden, die als junge
 Männer und Frauen mit Werten wie Freundschaft, Mut und 
Hilfsbereitschaft lebten. Dies inspirierte mich zu der Idee eines 
Kinderbuches, das eine mehrsprachiges Geschichte erzählt. Und vielleicht
 andere Kinder beeinflusst ebenfalls andere zu respektieren, mutig und 
liebevoll zu sein, und die welt zu einem besseren Platz zu machen. Als 
Hintergrund benutze ich Nahaufnahmen des Needlepainting Werkes Land of 
Hope.
バレエの世界を離れた後、私は妻と共にベルリンにスタジオを開きました。そこで私達は、子どもだった生徒達が友情、勇敢、誠実さを大切にする、輝きにあふ
れた大人へと成長し羽ばたいて行く姿を目の当たりにしました。社会で活躍する彼等の姿に私は強く心を動かされ、更に多くの子ども達に、私の生徒達の様に成
長して、より良い世界を作ってほしいと願うようになり、多言語の絵本を作ろうと決心しました。この絵本は、「希望の国」の刺繍のイメージを用いて、人を敬
う事、勇気を持つ事、人に親切に接する事といった大切な人生のレッスンが、子ども達の素晴らしい成長に結びついていくということを物語っています。
Land der Hoffnung, Landschaftsbild mit filigranen Details

The completed Land of Hope, a full landscape in astonishing detail.


「希望の国」の全貌
The StoryDie Geschichteあらすじ
The
 story focuses on Pepito, a man smaller than a blade of grass. He is 
envious of those around him who are big and strong, and his greatest 
wish is to be like them. He falls asleep one day and wakes up in the 
Land of Hope, where he meets many fascinating creatures. He asks each of
 them how he can become big and strong like them. 
One after 
another, each character gives suggestions to help him become a better 
person, such as having respect for others, giving a helping hand where 
needed, having courage in tough situations, and so on. In the end, 
Pepito realizes that having a big heart is more important than having a 
big body, and that even if he is small he can still make great changes 
in the world. 
Die Geschichte erzählt von Pepito, einem Männlein klein wie ein Grashalm .
 Er ist neidisch auf alle um ihn herum, die groß und kräftig sind, er 
wünscht sich ebenso zu sein. Eines tages erwachte er im Land der 
Hoffnung und trifft dort viele
 faszinierende Wesen. Er fragt jeden, wie er denn groß und stark werden 
könne. Einer nach dem anderen gibt einen Rat und macht Vorschläge, um 
ihm zu helfen. Z.B. Respekt für andere zu haben, anderen in der Not zu 
helfen oder Mut in schwierigen Situationen zu beweisen und so weiter. Am
 Ende versteht Pepito, dass es wichtiger ist ein großes Herz als einen 
großen Körper zu haben, und dass auch ein kleines Männlein große Dinge 
in der Welt bewirken kann!
主人公は、芝生の草よりも背の低いペピートです。彼は、周りにいる大きくて強い男の人たちに憧れています。ペピートの一番の願いは彼等のよ
うに強くてたくましくなる事です。ある日、ペピートが目覚めると、彼は希望の国にいました。そこで彼は、風変わりで素敵な住人たちに出会う度に、どうした
ら強く、大きくなれるか尋ねました。
希望の国の住人達は、ペピートの問いかけに、他者に敬意を持って接する事、困った人を助ける事、困難な状況でも勇気を持って立ち向かう事など様々な
助言をくれました。最後にペピートは、身体が大きいことより、大きな心を持つ方が大事だということ、自分がどんなに小柄でも世の中を大きく変えられるんだ
という事に気がつきました。

One of Horacio's sketches of Pepito. Various images like this one 
will be scattered throughout the pages for children to find - more 
information on the imagined layout can be found further down on this 
page.Dies
 ist eine von Horacio´s Zeichnungen. Dies ist Pepito, der auf vielen 
Seiten auftaucht, wo ihn die Kinder suchen müssen. Mehr Information zum 
Lay-Out  weiter  unten auf deiser seite.


オーラシオが描いたペピートのスケッチ。このようなイメージを絵本の所々に描いて、子ども達に楽しんでもらおうと思っています。絵本のレイアウトに関しては、下記をご覧下さい。
Why is this so important? 
Warum ist dieses Buch wichtig?
このプロジェクトの重要性
It is
 our belief that children cannot get enough positive influences in their
 growing years, so that they can become adults with good values to live 
by. When we raise a child to be good and compassionate, we bring more 
positive energy into the world. It's no secret that there are issues 
that exist around the globe that keep some people from living the best 
life they could have, and by teaching our next generations to be 
compassionate and helpful, we create a force for good that could, with 
time, bring peace to this world. The more we encourage children to have 
strong positive values, the closer we come to bringing the Land of Hope 
off the canvas and into reality.
Wir
 glauben fest daran, dass Kinder garnicht genug positive Einflüsse bei 
ihrer Erziehung erfahren können, um später als Erwachsene ein festes 
Fundament an positiven Glaubenssätzen zu haben. Jedes Kind, das zu 
Mitgefühl erzogen wird, wird selber immer einen positiven Beitrag in 
seinem Leben leisten. Die Welt ist vielerorts in Aufruhr, es gibt 
weltweit ernste Probleme. Da ist es wichtig, den Kindern liebevolle 
Energie und Erziehung zu geben, damit die Welt zu mehr Frieden und 
liebevollem Miteinander findet. Umso mehr Kinder starke positive 
Wertvorstellungen haben, umso eher kann aus dem Land of Hope Realität 
werden!
今
の子ども達は、正しい価値観を持つ大人へと成長する課程において、良い影響を与えられる機会が減っているのではないかと感じています。私たち大人が、思い
やりと正しい心をもつ子どもを育てることができれば、世界にもっと有益な変化をもたらし、社会に貢献できると考えています。今、世界ではさまざまな問題が
起きていて、本来なら手にできるはずの幸せな生活を送れない人々がいます。将来をになう子ども達に、人に対する思いやりを育くみ、大切さを教え伝えること
ができたら、きっといつか、それが世界の平和につながっていくに違いないと考えます。子ども達に強い正義感や前向きに生きていくすばらしさを伝えることが
できたら、この「希望の国」を布の上の刺繍の世界から現実のものに近づけることができるはずです。
We
 are also aiming to make this book multilingual, for two main reasons: 
1) We want Pepito's journey to be accessible to children all over the 
world, not just in English-speaking countries, and 2) exposing children 
to foreign languages at an early age helps them gain an interest in 
other cultures, which helps them develop the ideas of empathy and 
cooperation.  These go well with the other values presented in this 
book, and are especially helpful in our modern global world. Our base 
goal is for English and German, and we are working with a Japanese 
translator. Perhaps another language could be added if there is
 enough space and interest. We will keep you up-to-date on any 
developments.
Unser
 Ziel ist es, das Buch mehrsprachig heraus zu geben. Das hat mehrere 
Gründe, zum einem kann so Pepitos Geschichte in vielen Ländern gelesen 
und verstanden werden, zum anderen lernen Kinder 
von klein auf, dass es verschiedene Sprachen und Kulturen gibt, deren 
Unterschiedlichkeit wertfrei und selbstverständlich ist. Das ist in der 
globalen Welt von heute sicher von Vorteil. Im 
Moment gibt es die geschichte auf deutsch und englisch, eine japanische 
Übersetzung ist in Planung, auch andere Sprachen können hinzu gefügt 
werden, je nach Platz und Interesse. Wir halten Sie über die Entwicklung auf dem Laufenden,
私は、次に挙げます二つの理由でこの絵本を多国語で出版したいと考えています。まず一つ目は、英語圏だけでなく、世界中の子ども達にペピー
トの冒険を楽しんでもらいたいと思っています。そして二つ目は、子ども達には早くから外国語に触れる機会を与え、自国とは異なる文化に興味を持ち、他者に
対する共感や、協調性を養う事に役立ててほしいと思うからです。

以上二点は、この絵本から学んでもらいたい他の大切な価値観とともに、子ども達がグローバル化が進む現代社会を生きていくために、非常に役立つものだと考
えます。　先ずは、英語、ドイツ語で出版する事が目標ですが、現在、日本語への翻訳も検討中です。賛同・支援して下さる方がいれば、その他の言語への翻訳
も検討したいと思っております。当プロジェクトの進展については、随時ご報告申し上げます。
What We Need
Was wir brauchen
皆様のご支援のお願い
Land
 of Hope has already been fully written, and we are already working with
 a German publishing company, S. Fischer Verlage, to get it out into the
 world. They have given us a price estimate of 7,000 Euro as an absolute
 minimum for production. It's a greater amount than we can afford to pay
 out-of-pocket, which is 
why we are turning to you for help! Every dollar or euro counts. 
Das

 Land der Hoffnung ist bereits fertig geschrieben, und wir sind in 
Kontakt mit einem deutschen Verlagshaus (S. Fischer Verlage). Dort hat 
man uns einen Mindestpreis von 7 500 € für Druck und Vertrieb genannt. 
Leider fehlt uns das nötige geld, so wenden wir uns an Sie - jeder noch 
so kleine Betrag hilft. 
「希望の国」の原稿は、既に出来上がっており、ドイツの出版社、S. Fischer 
Verlageから、絵本を世に送りだす準備を進めています。しかし、出版には、最低でも7,000ユーロの出資を要します。これは、私が個人的に用意で
きる金額を上回るものです。そのため、ぜひ皆様のご支援を頂ければと、今回お願いしております次第です。ご賛同いただきご支援を賜ることができましたら幸
いです。
However,
 our ultimate goal is €13,000 - that would cover editing, printing, 
production, grade-A advertisement, shipping and distribution to 
bookstores around the country, and would also upgrade the book into a 
larger, more child-friendly format. We've read the statistics on 
successful crowdfunding projects and know that a lower number is easier 
to reach, so we're hoping your generosity will go above and beyond our 
minimum goal to help us reach €13,000.
Das
 ultimative Ziel sind 13 000 €, was ausser Druck und allen damit 
verbundenen Kosten wie Versand und Vertrieb eine Top-Grade-A- 
Werbeaktion mit einschliesst. Das Buch könnte so 
auch ein etwas größeres, kinderfreundlicheres Format bekommen. Wir haben
 uns über erfolgreiche Crowdfunding-Projekte informiert und hoffen sehr,
 dass wir es schaffen, die optimale Summe zu erzielen. 
上記の金額は、出版に最低限必要な額であり、編集、印刷、製本、広告、発送、国内外への書籍流通・販売、そして、子ども達にとって親しみや
すい大きめのサイズ、読みやすいフォーマットにするなど、多少の工夫を加えますと、必要経費は13,000ユーロ程度になると概算しております。目標金額
を低めに設定したほうがプロジェクトの成功率が高いという統計を目にしたこともありますが、わたし達としましても、皆様の温かいご支援をいただき、子ども
達のためにより質の高い絵本を届けることができるよう、努力を惜しまない所存です。
Even if you can't 
contribute monetarily to Land of Hope, you can still help us out by 
spreading the word to anyone who may be interested! Sharing, emailing, 
tweeting, and word-of-mouth are absolutely invaluable to getting this 
project off the ground.
Wenn
 Sie im Moment finanziell nicht helfen können, freuen wir uns, wenn Sie 
helfen, indem Sie andere auf das Projekt aufmerksam machen, die 
vielleicht helfen können. Soziale Netzwerke, Emails, Kaffeklasch, 
Mundpropaganda, all dies trägt dazu bei, das Projekt zu verwirklichen. 
「希
望の国」に金銭的なご支援を頂けない場合でも、是非、このプロジェクトの事をお知り合いの方々へ伝えていただけたら幸いです。　情報のシェアリング、E
メールやツイッターを介して、又は、直接お話して頂くだけでも、このプロジェクトの実現に向けて非常にありがたい支援となります。
 This book is perfect for parents of young
 children, expecting parents, or even aunts, uncles, grandparents, and 
other relatives searching for a gift for the young ones in their lives. 
Dieses
 Buch ist ein schönes Geschenk für Eltern kleiner Kinder, also Eltern,

Predicted Timeline
Zeitplan
想定タイムライン
So, how long is this all going to take? 
So, wann wird was passieren?
このプロジェクトのタイムスケジュールは、どの様なものでしょうか。
In a perfect world, the timeline would look something like this:
Wenn alles klappt, sieht der Plan aus wie folgt:
想定しているタイムスケジュールは、以下の通りです。
October 31st, 2014: Crowdfunding begins!
Mid-December
 2014: Crowdfunding ends, all funds calculated, collected, and sent to 
publishers. Digital perks sent to supporters - just in time for the 
holidays!
January 2015: Publishing company begins production process for Land of Hope
Summer 2015: Printing is completed, books sent to Horacio and later distributed to bookstores
Summer/Fall 2015: Physical rewards shipped out to supporters, arriving once again just in time for the holidays!
31. Oktober 2014: das Crowdfunding beginnt!
Mitte Dezenber 2014: das Crowdfunding endet, alle Spenden gehen an den 
Verlag, die digitalen Perks (Belohnungen)  gehen an die Spender, 
pünktlich zum Weihnachtsfest!
Januar 2015: der Verlag beginnt die Produktion.
Sommer 2015: der Druck ist fertig, die Bücher werden versendet und an Buchläden verschickt.
Sommer/Herbst 2015: alle nicht-digitalen Perks , d.h. alle Geschenke werden verschickt, pünktlich zum nächsten Fest!
2014年10月31日：クラウドファンディング開始！
2014年12月中旬：クラウドファンディング終了。支援額の計算、出版社に送金。支援者への特典中、ネット上送信できるものは、クリスマス前にお届けします！
2015年1月：出版社「希望の国」絵本制作開始
2015年夏期：印刷・製本終了。オーラシオの手元に本が届けられ、いよいよ書店流通へ。
2015年夏・秋期：デジタル以外の特典を支援者様へ郵送。
Realistically, we know lots of things could happen to 
delay this process. If the crowdfuding isn't as successful as we hope, 
it may take some extra time to scrape up the last bit of money needed to
 pay the publishers. Printing may take longer than expected at the 
publishers, and mailing speeds can sometimes be unpredictable, 
especially internationally and around holidays. We can't know ahead of 
time what might happen, but we promise to keep you informed of all 
updates, good and bad, as soon as we find out about them. 
Es können immer Dinge passieren, die den Ablauf verzögern. Wenn z.B. das
 Crowdfunding nicht den gewünschten Erfolg hat. kann es noch
 dauern, bis wir den Rest zusammen gekratzt haben. Der Druck kann läner 
dauern, Versandzeiten können abweichen (vor allem international). Falls 
eine Verzögerung eintritt, werden alle benachrichtigt sobald wir davon 
Kenntnis haben.
以上は、あくまでも想定しているタイムラインであり、現実的には、様々な原因でプロセスに遅れが出る可能性が考えられます。例えば、当キャ
ンペーン中に集められた支援金が目標額を下回った場合、残りの必要な額を集めて出版社に送金するのに時間がかかったり、印刷が予想以上に長引いたり、郵
送、特にホリデー・シーズン中の海外郵送に時間がかかる事など考えられます。このの様な状況に変更があり次第、責任を持って皆様に随時ご報告致します。
How it Will Look
Wie wird das Buch aussehen?
完成した絵本
We are envisioning our book to be approximately 22 x 1 x 30
 centimeters. Each turn of the page will reveal a beautiful photograph 
from the Land of Hope tapestry, with a corresponding text (in at least 
two languages) on the other side that tells Pepito's story. Small 
sketches of the little man in various poses will appear alongside the 
text.
Wir planen das Buch in der Größe 22
 x 1 x 30 cm. Bei jedem Umblättern sieht man eine neue Seite mit einem 
Bildausschenitt des Werkes ""Land der Hoffnung"" zeigen mit den dazu 
gehörigen Texten in mindestens zwei Sprachen auf der gegenüberliegenden 
Seite. Kleine Zeichnungen des kleinen Pepito ergänzen das Bild.
完成した絵本は、22cm x 1cm x 30cm 
程のサイズを考えています。各ページを開くと、そこには、「希望の国」刺繍のタペストリーの美しい写真が広がり、それにあわせて少なくとも2つ以上の言語
でペピートのお話しを描きます。文章の隣には、かわいらしいペピートが様々なポーズで現れます。

One of our draft pages. So far, this only has the German text, and 
the height isn't exactly right. As soon as we have an updated version of
 this, we will let you know! See below for the English and Japanese translations that 
will be on this page: Hier ein Beispiel, erstmal nur mit dem deutschen Text und vorläufigem Format. Der englische Text folgt:

絵本の中のあるページのドラフトです。ここでは、皆さまに絵本のイメージをお伝えするために見本としてドイツ語の本文を入れてあります。本のサイズ少々完成版と異なります。校正したものができましたら改めて掲載します。下記に日本語の仮訳を掲載しましたのでご覧ください。
'To his great surprise Pepito met a man who was even smaller then he was.
Pepito said to him: “How can you be happy being so very small?”
And the small man answered: “Because I see that life is full of treasures like this pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.”
“Yes”, said Pepito, “I see. But I want to be big.”
“Good,"" said the small man, “then you must respect all persons 
whether they are smaller or bigger than you; then you will be big. Come 
with me to the pond for a drink.”'

ペピートはびっくりして目を丸くしました。

ここには、僕より小さい住人がいたなんて！
「どうしてそんなに小さくても幸せでいられるの？」ペピートは、尋ねました。
「それは、この虹の果てにある黄金の壷の様な宝ものが、人生には、たくさんあるからだよ。」と応えました。
「へぇ。そうなんだ。」「でもね、ぼくは、大きくなりたいんだ。」
「そうか。」その小さな住人は言いました。「それなら、自分より大きい人でも、小さい人でも、誰に対しても敬意をもって接することだな。そうしたら君は大きくなれるさ。ほら、一緒に池のほうにいって何か飲もうじゃないか。」Perks特典

</div><p>""You'll
be adding to the sum total of knowledge of the Vietnam era in a very
unique way; no one else has access to the stories that you do.""
~ Chris Welch, brother.</p>
<p><b>Campaign Summary</b></p>
<p><i>Who:</i> Me, Kat Fitzpatrick: writer &amp;
teacher.</p>
<p><i>What: </i>A trip to retrace my father's last
days in Vietnam at the end of the war when he evacuated 1300 people.</p>
<p><i>When: </i>April 21-April 30.</p>
<p><i>Where: </i>Saigon and Phu Quoc, Vietnam—the
sites of the evacuation.</p>
<p><i>Why: </i>See below.</p>
<p><i>How much: </i>$2000 to cover in-country travel
expenses*, media support and preliminary publication costs.</p>
<p><b>Why travel to Vietnam?</b> <b>Why now?</b></p>
<p>Some stories whisper ever so quietly in your ear
your whole life through.</p>
<p>Then there comes a time when you must turn from
whatever important thing you've been doing and say, ""What? What
exactly are you trying to tell me?""</p>
<p>I was one of the few American dependents who lived
in South Vietnam just before the country fell in April of 1975. My
father was one of the few Americans who loved, truly <i>loved</i>,
South Vietnam.  In those last fateful days, me and my mother and
siblings fled while my father stayed behind and orchestrated the
evacuation of 1300 South Vietnamese who would have otherwise died or
been subject to a fate worse than death.</p>
<p>This story has been the backdrop to my entire
life; quietly whispering, ever present, wholly unexplored.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I decided to write about it.
Returning to the land where the events took place became more and
more a certainty as I lived into the details of the story. I was
prepared and eager to go last fall. Then came the tragic death of my
older brother, Mike, and the plans and the resources for the trip
crumbled and slipped away. 
</p>
<p>But I know I must go; the story whispers more
strongly than ever. And this April will be exactly 40 years since the
fall of South Vietnam, since my father's heroic actions ... <i>exactly
40 years. </i>
</p>
<p>Your support of this trip and subsequent writing
will give life to a story that will offer a new entré
into the Vietnam era, an era in our history that still speaks so
loudly and yet so obliquely. 
</p>
<p>These stories will come alive on my ongoing blog
""Stories of Vietnam,"" (<a href=""http://www.StoriesofVietnam.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.StoriesofVietnam.com</a>), through a
nonfiction teaching tool/book for high school students (working
title: <i>The Lost Evacuation</i>), and, ultimately, in a personal
memoir (working title: <i>Love and Violence)</i>.</p><p></p><p>

All donors will receive a deluxe thank you postcard from Vietnam, and
be included in the kudos, thank yous and acknowledgments on the blog

Contributions
in any amount will help me bring to life a story that can serve as a
profound, and uniquely positive, teaching tool about the
Vietnam Era.

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Ekklesia is an independent, not-for-profit thinktank which orients its work around the changing role of beliefs, values and faith/non-faith in public life.  We have a track record in producing reports and commentary that is both thought-provoking and transformative.</p>

<p>The book will provide a brief history of British housing and ask why Christians should care about housing issues.

The book will conclude with a ten point action plan that lays out positive steps to improve housing in the UK.</p>
<p>The book will be edited by Andrew Francis and Trisha Dale and will feature essays from: Andrew Francis, Reverend David Walker, Bishop of Manchester, Sean Gardiner, Chris Horton,  Helen Roe, Helen Woolley, Raymond Young and Paul Lusk.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Buck Moore and I am the author of a book called Let Me Tell You About the Time. I wrote this book because I believe that the future generations of my family need to know about their ancestors. Well, I can at least tell them about this one.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be amused with my journey and adventures and maybe even discover a yearning to put your own experiences in print as well.</p>
<p>If you know me, you need to read this to see what I wrote about you. If you read this book but don't know me yet, you'll probably know me pretty well by the time that you finish.</p>
<p>You will love this book! It will make you laugh, cry, and sometimes cringe. I expect you will see a bit of yourself in my stories and relationships as well.</p>

<p>The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</p>

<p>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</p>
<p>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this summer</p>
<p>.</p>
<br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition.

<h3>Who we are, and what we’re doing!</h3>
<p>My name is James Rojas, and my partner is John Kamp. We are urban planners who make up the Place It! team. For the past 15 years, we have been fighting the good fight to make community engagement for planning our cities more creative, collaborative, and inspiring. We have developed innovative engagement methods that focus on memory, working with your hands, model-building, and experiencing and reflecting on the world around us with our senses. Through over 1,000 Place It! workshops across the country and world, we have seen participants not only be transformed and empowered by the workshops but also have their creative, visionary ideas come to life. </p>
<p>People who come to our workshops always ask us afterwards, “When are you going to write a book about this?”</p>
<p>Well, now we are.</p>
<p>We’ve signed a contract with Island Press and will be writing a book on not only what we have learned from our hands-on way of doing community engagement but also what you can learn and then apply to your own work in urban planning, design, community organizing, public health, landscape, psychology, and more. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The thing is, writing a book is immensely time-consuming – not simply because of the writing itself but also because of the sheer number of interviews we are conducting: we will be interviewing a huge range of people including those who have participated in our workshops or used the method on their own; psychologists who work in art therapy; and urban planners working on the inside. </p>
<p>So this is where you come in: we’re looking to raise $10,000 to pay for both the writing hours and the interviewing for the book. This will also include any travel we need to make to conduct the interviews around California (we always travel by train for a nice, low-C02 ride!). </p>
<p>We have a generous donor who will match whatever amount you donate, so if we reach $5,250 (Indiegogo charges 5% in fees – hence the extra $250) on here, we’ll reach our goal of $10,000! </p>
<p>As far as what you get if you donate, here is how we can break it down:</p>
<p>1. Donate $1 - $199: receive our monthly newsletter (to go live upon completion of the crowdfunding campaign) on the progress of the book, including profiles of folks we are interviewing, photos (we’ll try to make them glamorous, even though writing a book can feel like anything but), any useful and relevant insights we’ve made, and recent articles we have written that are relevant to the book.</p>
<p>2. $200 - $499: receive a free copy of the book, plus the aforementioned monthly newsletter</p>
<p>3. $500 – $1,000: A Place It! workshop in your neck of the woods (travel costs for workshops within California waived; outside of California, we’ll need those covered), a free copy of the book, plus the aforementioned monthly newsletter</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Given our 15+ years of workshops on the ground, and the constant demand for us to write a book about these experiences, and the extensive network of people we have brought into the Place It! orbit, we are confident that this book will not only be a meaningful and inspiring read but also help shift the conversation on our cities and how we engage people in shaping and improving them in times of great uncertainty and change. </p>
<p>Can we deliver? Well, even before signing the contract, we had already gone through a year polishing up our proposal and writing sample chapters (yes, even before we signed a contract) for the editors based on their feedback. Since signing the contract, we’ve created two massive spreadsheets to organize and schedule the writing of the book and the interviews. Long story short: we are ones who keep our noses to the grindstone, deliver on promises, and meet our deadlines.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can donate money, that is awesome. If not, perhaps help us out by sharing a link of this campaign with your networks and spreading the word about the game-changing work Place it! is both doing and writing the book about.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A lot of the work I create comes from pondering on disappearing. My new project is a little different to my previous projects in form. This is to raise money to go towards course fees which will aid me in the writing of a collection of poetry on the theme of disappearing.</p>
<p>I am a circus artist and a writer for my company Collectif and then... several years ago I complete a BA in Circus Arts at The Circus Space (London), on which I formed a company with my circus partner. After graduation, we went on to create and perform circus shows internationally in places such as The Roundhouse (London), Teatro Circo Price (Madrid) and Cidade De Deus Circus Tent (Rio De Janeiro). We have received awards from such organisations as Deutsche Bank and The Jerwood Foundation.</p>
<p>I write texts for the work we perform, and poetry in response to it. Now I would like to concentrate on creating a more solid body of work, on the ever present theme of disappearing.</p>
<p>Originally I was accepted onto an MA in Creative writing at Chichester University. However, the cost of the course is quite high, and have decided to defer this. Instead, I will take classes at <a href=""http://www.poetryschool.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Poetry School"">The Poetry School</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I will use the funding to cover the course fees for the Classes at The Poetry School to develop my collection. I know not everyone can afford to donate as much as they would like, so I will send everyone who donates anything a poem by email.</p>
<p>For higher donations I can send a selection of 5 poems and for even higher, I can write a personalised poem</p>
<p>I live on a canal barge, so I am able to offer a day cruise for those that can come to London for the pleasure. (there are up to 5 of these rewards available - for people who are able to donate £1000)</p>
<p>I am open to suggestions and offers for rewards!</p>
<p>Everybody will receive thankyous and my eternal gratitude!</p>
<p>If I dont reach my goal, I will defer my course by 1 year, giving me more time to fundraise the right amount.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are few people who combine writing and circus, and I think the crossovers are very exciting. Both practices require discipline, training and clear lines! There is much room for exploration in the crossovers between circus and poetry, and the research will help me develop my artistic practice and style. The classes will give me the support and guidance I need to write the collection of poetry. I have completed several mid scale performances and am very used to handling budgets due to the work with my circus company.</p>

There are few people who combine writing and circus, and I think the crossovers are very exciting. Both practices require discipline, training and clear lines! There is much room for exploration in the crossovers between circus and poetry, and the research will help me develop my artistic practice and style. The classes will give me the support and guidance I need to write the collection of poetry. I have completed several mid scale performances and am very used to handling budgets due to the work with my circus company.
