  About the Book 
Here’s a brief introduction to my book, The Time Traveller’s Resort and Museum. I hope you like it.
“If you need to know men's secrets
Or if there's something you need to find
If you want to see the dinosaurs
Or the insides of your mind.
If you want to watch the earth begin,
Or see what the apocalypse will leave behind,
You need to thank Alice Anderson,
For Alice is the mother of time.”
That was how the rhyme went. Every time traveler knew it. Everyone that is, except of course, for Alice herself, since she hadn’t invented time travel yet. Since returning to London, Alice’s life has been turned upside down. She’s been accused of murder and lost her position in the scientific community. Her only ally in this journey is a strange man who seems to think that Alice may be about to open up a strange new world of possibilities, but is probably not telling her everything he knows.

I worked in an opera theater for fifteen years, and I currently own a small business while I make different kinds of art. I live in Bulgarian, Europe, and am fully aware of how difficult it is to publish stuff written by an author from such a small country, even if they specifically have the western reading audience in mind. In the novel at hand, there is nothing bound by region or conviction. Well, perhaps just a gentle whiff of my home country.</p><p>***</p><p>Dear friends,</p><p>Since my end goal is colossal - $100 million to finance the creation of a high-budget film adaptation of PLANET SHIP 1 – PREDATORY FOG – I will need to be backed by quite a lot of people.

The more people come across this project, the more likely it is that it will gain more supporters and backers.<br/>So, in one project, I’ve separated the pledge options into two.

I want you to know that, if we, you and me, manage to turn my novel  PLANET SHIP 1 – PREDATORY FOG into a big blockbuster movie, you will have been the main reason for this being possible!!

The plot is highly dynamic, the characters are varied and interesting, and, naturally, there are plenty of twists and turns. You’ll get to see future tech the likes of which have not been featured in science fiction. Espionage, adventure, genuine human relationships, love, war, breathtaking space vistas, colossal construction projects and new, amazing weaponry. Galactic skirmishes, arena fights between people with muscles of iron and artificial creatures. The novel has been written as a, if you will, glimpse into the future. That is, it treats fiction as a plausible progression of what we know to be true. This piece of science fiction is as much about science as it is about humanity.</p><div>
<p>The plot spans some five-hundred pages, taking place around the year 2569. Humanity has spread to six planets throughout the galaxy, yet, its innate adventurous spirit drives it to search for ever greater and faster means of travel and more ways of conquering the Universe. A genius inventor comes up with a way to achieve just that – a planet, which can function as an enormous space vessel. However, evil forces lead by a fanatical dictator will aggressively intervene and seek to take over the greatest achievement of the united human species. Only an individual of unique qualities and abilities can help neutralize the space-faring threat. But where can such an individual be found? How is he or she to be recruited for the noble cause?</p>
<p>From the very beginning, I thought of the book, and eventually wrote it, as a dramatized movie script. While I worked on it, I could picture the various scenes – real, fleshed out, as if they were happening right in front of my eyes. This is why the chapters are usually short and lead into one another like quick film edits.</p>
<p>The book is not intended only for fans of the Sci-Fi genre. A number of my friends, all from different walks of life, interests and social strata have thus far read and like it quite a bit.</p>
<p>This is not just science fiction. It is my best guess as to what things will be like fife hundred years into the future in all facets of life. In its pages, readers will encounter a veritable bubbling volcano of relationships, passion and real characters – love, hate, friendship, betrayal, hypocrisy, lies, naivety, lust for power, despotism, manipulativeness and subordination, ambition and domination, treachery and honesty, willingness to suffer and egoism. All fundamental components of a society, regardless of whether we locate said society in medieval times, today, or a couple of centuries in the future.</p>
<p>You may ask, “Why not publish it back home?” Well, that’s something of a tall order in my country, unless, of course, you’ve already established yourself and have stable financial backing. And, as I said, the novel is meant for a global audience. Ideally, there will be copies of it from the North Pole all the way down to Antarctica. Publishing houses here don’t have the resources for that sort of thing, and there aren’t many agencies who introduce local authors internationally. I was told that western publishers aren’t really all that interested in authors from my general geographic whereabouts. I have no clue why. Is it the way locals have presented themselves on the international stage or because of some prejudice? Honestly, I don’t know, but that publishing employee turned out to be right. I wrote to a few big agencies, but I never heard back. I’m no Stephen King or Michael Chrichton. Definitely no Donald Trump or Putin. I actually have no idea how an agency chooses their clients based on a short letter and (when they *do* ask for a text sample) ten or so pages of a novel. Whether a person is popular or not is definitely part of the equation. Sometimes I wonder how many great works are just gathering dust in the dusky drawers of their creators?!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I approached a major documentary network about possibly creating a killer of an ad film based on my novel, since their name, logo design, activity can be a notable element in the production. It was in there, in the plot, a key component from the very beginning. I was told that such a venture was “not part of their programming plans.” I even tried to contact Elon Musk, since he is obviously a visionary, dreamer, and citizen of the cosmos in general, to try and introduce him to my book, but to no avail. Same thing with Neil deGrasse Tyson. I wrote to the Bulgarian representatives of a big film and TV production corporation – no response. I could go on, but I trust the point has been made.</p>
<p>This is where I should clarify why I’m not seeking to self-publish via physical media. It’s simple. If I set a goal of $5,000 and reach that, I could print (at a price of  $10 per copy) five hundred copies! I’d need more just to thank my backers! Let’s say I set a much higher goal and succeed? How would that benefit my future development? Isn’t that what crowdfunding is for? Do I need to reimagine myself and qualify as my novel’s production line? What market should I aim it at? How do I deal with delivery etc. That, I believe, should be left to the professionals, while the creators… create away.</p>
<p>And so, I’m aiming high. My dream is to have a big Hollywood movie made on the basis of my novel, and I’m certain that no major studio would scoff at a $100,000,000. That, in my mind, is the budget required for a worthwhile production. Also, I’m not just going to give that money away to a studio. Even if I’m not a producer per se, I’m definitely taking an active part in the creative process for my novel’s adaptation.</p>
<p>My dear future backers, this project might seem unfeasible, even delusional, I know. Yet, I am convinced that a belief in oneself is the first step to accomplishing ANY task. There is a saying in Bulgaria, which roughly translates into “gathered and united, people can even lift a mountain.” In other words, unity makes strength. Take on the challenge so that we can all be proud of our common deed! Share the project with your friends, let us be the driving force behind a fearsome wave of creative life force. When George Lucas made the original Star Wars, he had no notion of how successful his passion project would become. He must have stood at the door of the movie theater after that first projection, waiting to examine the expressions on the faces of the departing patrons. How deeply excited he must have been to see them not departing, but lining up again to buy another ticket!</p>
<p>I believe that you’re here not to simply buy another book. I know that you want to greenlight human creativity, so that more pieces that result from that creativity may belong to humanity, even if that means opposing those who are in control of humanity’s resources. Each of you will be rewarded with a little piece that will hopefully remain with you as a monument to generosity. Most important of all, you will be left with the indelible knowledge of having made possible something awesome!</p>
<p>The novel wasn’t written with 7.5 billion people in mind. Some of you, after you back the project and receive your copies will, no doubt, not find it to your liking. What I hope, though, is that you’ll enjoy supporting a wacky dreamer who dares meddle in the world of the all-mighty players and hopes to change it for the better, even if it’s just a tiny, tiny change.</p>
<p>I am fully cognizant of what it means to undertake such a project, and I truly believe that it will be successful world-wide. After all, I’m not going into this all alone. I am beyond certain that among those reading this, there is a sufficient number of kindred spirits and supporters. I’d just like to say, at this point, thank you!</p>
<p>I’ve not been alone up to this point during all my years in the creative netherworld. There are a number of people, my friends, without whose help and support this project would not be possible. I would like to express my unending gratitude to my most selfless supporters.</p>
<p>Lyubomir Petkov – attorney</p>
<p>Diyana Nikolova – linguist</p>
<p>Dessimir Zakov – musician and businessman</p>
<p>Todor Kalaydzhiev – financial expert</p>
<p>Blagovest Petrov – IT specialist</p>
<p>Atanas Dikov – owner of a printing center</p>
<p>Svetlana Dinkova – accountant</p>
<p>Petar Vasilev – engineer</p>
<p>Ivailo Kavaldjiev – businessman</p>
<p>Boris Stoilov – cover artist</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They all helped me while I was writing the novel.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The novel itself is finished and the text has been translated into English. A huge thanks to my incredible translator, editor, and friend, <strong>Vadim Banev</strong> – faculty member of the English Linguistics and Literature department in the Paisii Hilendarski University, <strong>Plovdiv</strong>, Bulgaria.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Naturally, I am in no way stopping. I’m currently writing the second volume in the trilogy, and it’s going great. Over a hundred chapters so far, with the entire plot already finalized in my head. After all, we have the second movie to think about, don’t we? ;)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few clarifications:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Predatory Fog </i>is not being distributed commercially, and nobody but me has the authority to do so. To officially claim my rights as the author of a book with a unique ISBN, I’ve self-published the original Bulgarian text in a small number of paperback copies, and have offered the first of seven parts of the English translation as an e-book purchase option on a popular e-commerce platform.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each of our supporters will receive the entirety of the English translation as an e-book shortly after pledging, along with a special electronic certificate, which features cover art. The latter is suitable for larger scale prints and framing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A portion of the funds I manage to collect as a result of this campaign will be set aside to publish the novel. I’m looking for a small and reliable publishing house that will be willing to give me a chance. This is not going to be a quick or easy process, so I can’t promise you printed copies just yet. Once the novel has been published, I plan to send a signed copy to the top 1000 backers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I do reach my goal $100 million, the top 100 will also receive a custom, personalized statuette in the <i>Planet Ship</i> design style, which will bear the respective backers’ names; a kind of personal little academy award.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I honestly don’t know whether a big movie company would be willing to have my top backers on set to enjoy the filming process, but I intend to fight for the inclusion of a such a clause in any potential contracts. My top ten backers would then be able to join me on location in Hollywood or wherever the movie is being made.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’ve also come up with a unique gift for some of supporters, to be chosen randomly – a drawing I’ve made myself in an avant-garde aesthetic, which features a stylized signature. I can’t really say how long each of the drawings will take to produce, since I only draw when inspiration really pummels me hard and out of nowhere, so I can’t really give you details on that gift as far as numbers and dates.</p>
<p>Since some would ask what I’d be using the money for if I don’t reach my goal of $100 million, I’ve included a small map, if you will, of how I intend to proceed depending on what portion of the intended financing is collected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From $60 million to $100 million – a big-budget film</p>
<p>From $20 million to $60 million – an impressive series</p>
<p>From $1 million to $20 million – a miniseries featuring the first few episodes of larger series</p>
<p>From $100,000 to $1 million – seeking co-financing from a producer</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">From $20,000 to $100,000 </span>– <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">self-publishing of the novel, advertisement campaigns for said novel</span></p>
<p>From $5,000 to $20,000 – working with a publishing house to get the novel out there</p>
<p>From $3 to $5,000 – popularizing of PREDATORY FOG, since, naturally, the book can’t just sit there on a shelf and gather dust!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And now, I would kindly direct you to go back and look at the first entry in this list! ;)</p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>It would be an immense pleasure to have you on the team that can make my dream come true! I sincerely thank you for your attention and wish you robust health and good fortune in everything you do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To better understand what you might be getting yourself into, I’d like to invite you to read the first twenty pages of the novel here.</p>

<p>The boy was playing in the sandbox in front of the apartment building. His father observed him – the smile on his face twitching in an unconscious impulse of pride and tenderness. His son had constructed a couple of sand hills, apparently a proxy for the glorious palace in the boy's mind. The child rose and glanced at his father, whose entire being exuded a kind of singular sense of triumph. The boy stretched out with his hands, laughed in anticipation of the father's approval, but was too late. The man stood up from the bench and started forward, arms stretched out as well. As he walked, a dark shadowy mass came in and dimmed the sunlight. He looked up and froze on the spot; his face contorted in a grimace of horror. The flying object obstructing the sun hovered, immobile, above the open areas between the apartment buildings. The boy followed his father's gaze and immediately turned to him with bewildered, questioning eyes. Before the father could move even slightly, a lightning-white flash struck him. The man turned gray, much like concrete, and was literally rendered into stone in seconds – then fell apart into countless tiny particles. What seemed like grains of fine sand settled on the concrete slab the man had been standing on. The boy just stood there, confused. His eyes filled with tears as he started to sob and look around. There was no soul in sight; he was all alone amid the palpable workday afternoon silence. He looked up. The sun's rays caressed his cheeks glistening with teardrops. Once again he focused on the small pile of sand on the playground. He leaned down, took his bucket and toy spade, approached, tripping and stumbling along the way, knelt and began collecting his father's ashes.</p>

<p><strong>            1.</strong>Professor Alexander Belk was so amazed at the idea that had just bloomed in his mind that he nearly spilled his coffee. It was early in the afternoon on December 10, 2569 of the Standard Interplanetary Calendar. In what constituted a small wonder, the Professor was currently enjoying a brief period of no meetings or arrangements, so he made the most of his break out in the open air. He sat alone at a table in the café overseeing the Third strait of Swan city, enjoying the gentle sunshine of the local star Lan. His thoughts fired rapidly, flowing into each other like dissimilar layers of fog and mist. He pictured the lecture hall, full of students, not much younger than himself. Then he dove into deep thought about how necessary it was for him to finally stir up his monotonous, orderly scholar being by means of the affections of some interesting young lass. He then decided to leave such burdensome contemplation behind and let himself focus on what he loved most – fantasizing about space exploration, the future of civilization, even considering the notion of universal dissemination of the human species. The last subject was something he came back to quite often. No, it couldn't be done with ships. Even if said ships could house hundreds of thousands of individuals. The distances which had to be traversed and the amounts of time that would take were so great that no artificially-manufactured society of beings would be able to cope without succumbing to self-annihilation. What is more, nothing could justify using the newly-discovered engine technology, known only to a small number of scientists and high-ranking politicians on Arfinia, in a simple space-faring vessel. The so-called space-warper was a discovery of colossal importance; producing an actual working engine based on the technology would take immense resources, the likes of which even his own homeland would not be able to spare, in spite of being the most powerful state on all six habitable planets.</p>
<p>            Alex tasted his coffee as he reached this point in his contemplation and … The image came to him without warning, striking and clear. Not just an idea, but an entirely functional system of analysis, concept, and implementation. His hands twitched but Alex overcame the urge without spilling a single drop of the precious fragrant liquid. He looked around, saw nobody was paying attention and stood up. He leaned on the railings and gazed into the wave-like structure of the strait splitting the continent in two. He took in a few breaths of fresh air, looked wistfully at the emerald-green sky of Grenaira, sighed a sigh of affirmation and set his body phone to dial mode. The cerebral impulses of the answering party responded, but there was no voice on the line. Probably not the best time or place to talk, yet listening was obviously an option. Alex smiled, his face taking on a provocative expression. He caressed his stubble and declared triumphantly, ""Planet ships! But, don't mind me, please, carry on with your ever-so-important affairs of state, he-he-he ...""</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>            2.</strong> Timothy Shevchenko sat at the Round table where the Interplanetary Council of leaders was holding session. The place chosen for the meeting was a middling hall some ten floors above the Mahmuldar congress center, Mahmuldar being the leading state on the planet Saa. On this specific occasion it was Timothy's go at representing Grenaira. He was selected from a pool of the seven presidents of Arfinia and leaders of other, smaller states. Earth's representative had been speaking when Timothy received the call. He waited, rather impatiently, for the speech to be over, so as to make use of the small break window that would follow.</p>
<p>            He retired to the room assigned to him and immediately activated his holographic monitor to contact Belk. The Professor popped up on the screen, grinning a ridiculously wide grin.</p>
<p>            ""Quite the meeting, I take it?"" he stated inquisitively.</p>
<p>            ""Young man, have you thought this through?"" Shevchenko started, not skipping a beat. ""Or are you just keeping yourself busy and wasting my time with science fiction?""</p>
<p>            ""Through? I haven't thought at all,"" the Professor added, maintaining his upbeat delivery, ""the whole thing just materialized in my head. The whole system, Mr. President, a completed project, down to the smallest detail.""</p>
<p>            ""You believe it would be feasible for us to execute?""</p>
<p>            ""Depends on what you mean by <i>us.""</i></p>
<p>            ""Right, so we can't do it alone. Hm, a planet ship you say, Al?""</p>
<p>            ""A planet ship.""</p>
<p>            ""Quite the idea. Probably in the quadrillion ballpark...""</p>
<p>            ""More like quintillion, Tim.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>            3. </strong>The dissemination of humans was not a new idea. The subject had been considered current ever since Homo sapiens had taken its first steps and haughtily looked down upon all other creatures roaming the African plains of its homeworld. Not long after, at least on the immensely grand scale of time itself, the nascent species conquered and populated its planet. It was not enough, however, and humans looked up at the stars. In 2171 a human astronaut stepped on a habitable alien planet for the first time. This opened the proverbial floodgates for the little green planet. Grenaira became humanity's second home. Slowly but surely, space exploration went further and further, and throughout the centuries, thousands of ships criss-crossed the galaxy, discovering ever more twins of old Earth. The number of human beings grew incessantly, and there was no lack of enthusiastic volunteers who wanted to settle, start anew, throw away the shackles of one gravity index for another. Regardless of the motives of any single individual, by the end of the 25<sup>th</sup> century human civilization consisted of six planets, perfectly suited for life, as well as hundreds of less hospitable colonies which provided an endless supply of valuable natural resources, built upon sparsely populated asteroids and planetoids.</p>
<p>            And even though there was sufficient space for billions more humans on these worlds, even though they could feed many generations to come, even though the members of the societies there could traverse distances, which just a few hundred years prior might have seemed unthinkable, to visit their brethren from light-years away, there were, nevertheless, people who never stopped dreaming of taming more of the frontier. Just like the man who had constructed the first raft and sailed Earth's oceans to colonize another continent, there were modern humans who dreamed of building ships to lead humanity to other galaxies. Nobody had gone beyond the Milky Way as of yet. That is, unless one believed the numerous myths and legends of astronaut folklore.</p>
<p>            Some insisted that man had not yet matured enough to travel the distances between galaxies, and that such a thing could not happen before humanity developed into whatever evolution had in store for it. Others were convinced that very thing had already happened. Or just about, at least. They claimed a transitional species had existed for a long time – a species worthy of investing one's hopes in, capable of making that great leap – Cyborgs.</p>
<p>            Actually, in that period during the second half of the 26<sup>th</sup> century a great deal of humans could be classified as such as well, in spite of most not accepting or approving of it. They thought it brought them lower somehow, to be nothing more than an ordinary robot, a construct, not that dissimilar to some household appliance, a vacuum cleaner or what have you. Yet, they had no reason to be ashamed of what they were. The scientific advances of cybernetics had made it possible to elevate the species. It was not just that human beings became sick less often and lived twice as long as their 21<sup>st</sup> century counterparts; they could enhance the scope and abilities of their very intellect. Those who chose to have their heart replaced, their skeletal framework strengthened, or have their mental capacity increased via artificial additions, were not in any way opposed to these improvements. Still, they did not wish to be referred to as cyborgs. And with good reason, too; a simple explanation that was evident and valid on its own merit. That reason was the Cyborg Society.</p>
<p>            In the beginning, hundreds of years ago, it was not a true organization. More of a club of extravagant, eccentric individuals from different parts of the worlds. They were proud of the chips and circuits they integrated into their bodies to ""shine the way for science"", as they usually phrased it. As centuries passed, installing internal components and adding external ones into the human biology became mass practice. Post-2550, body modules were manufactured from predominantly organic materials and could scarcely be differentiated from natural organs. Almost, that is, as every scanner contrasted the two like puddles of water in the sand. Of course, nobody wanted to conceal the presence of such acquisitions as it was no different from having an artificial tooth in the old days. However, throughout the entirety of the history of cybernetics, there were those individuals who paraded their more advanced and costlier physical and mental enhancements, looking down on the common man.</p>
<p>            Gradually, people who liked the title of cyborg created their own organized hierarchical structure. They considered themselves superior to humans, apparently fancied themselves an entirely new species. Bit by bit, they began to stray from the rest of humanity, started to gather in their own groups and parties, finally forming a wholly separate society. One of Cyborgs, the Cyborg Society. Later on, they would leave behind the ""gravitational confines"", as they called planets, and live aboard their city ships. Only a small amount of humans were aware of this, while the masses were blissfully oblivious to such goings-on. They knew of the Society in as much as they knew they were not part of it and its unfounded claims of superiority. What business was it of theirs that there was this faction, imaginary or not, of peculiar and pathologically-deviant minds, thank you very much!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>            4. </strong>Tsar Fog de Berg sat in his private upgrade clinic. The Doctor added the final lubial neuron, connected it to the synapses and psychodorms by means of a microbiosuture and, satisfied with his work, smiled at the Ruler. He, in turn, frowned in approval, and the Doctor applied the new strip of enhancing cortex tissue. Then he reattached the bone, fixed the scalp and irradiated the area with a ciffisian lamp to let the tissue grow back. Yet another regal cerebral upgrade was completed. De Berg smiled, seemingly at himself. Now he truly possessed the most powerful intellect in known space. He looked at himself in the mirror. Handsome too! Such a broad, manly brow. Now his head was worth over a trillion arfins (or Bergs, Fog corrected himself), not counting the unquantifiable aesthetic value it held. The best part was only he could make use of it, so no one would be tempted to take it away from him. Tsar Fog de Berg was so content that he did not even allow for the possibility of there being someone, who, like that, for the hell of it, would like to just blow up this jewel of the biocybernetic medical arts. Yet, he reminded himself that some devious foe could potentially break into the tacit corner of his artificial memory. That was only possible with the competent aid of the very physician who completed the update, who, as it happened, was just taking off his operating gown. The Tsar sighed in utter vexation and demolecularized him right to the floor. The sanitary robot sucked up the remnants of the physician (and his illustrious career), and deposited them into the trash compartment, where they were swiftly blown into space. Disgusted, Fog rubbed away a stray ashy particle from his eye. He contemplated whether it was possible for the discarded dust to be the spark to some proto-life and its ensuing evolutionary process, should it happen upon the right planet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>            5. </strong>Far from all those innovative, technologically-endowed corners of space, the state of Gorania pulsed with its own steady life beats. For millennia, it had remained uncared-for in a distant corner of Europe, Earth, and ultimately, of history. The ancient country had been witness to centuries of upward and downward surges, and now, at the end of the 26<sup>th</sup> century, had subsided into lethargy, the likes of which it had not experienced even during the countless times of being annexed, conquered, and having its borders redrawn. Nobody attacked anymore, for the values they once held dear were twisted, long-gone, to be replaced by those of outsiders. Well, there were still beautiful, unsullied swaths of nature to be sure, but those could be found in many different countries, on many different planets. And so, Gorania rested in its vegetative state, somewhere along the border between the rest of Europe and the member-nations of the Eurasian Union, undisturbed in its sublime backward-mindedness.</p>
<p>            A scarce but tough people lived there. They had learned to survive among their peers, which was no small feat in and of itself. Goranians were accustomed to being dependent on nobody but their closest; they didn't have any newfangled technology or machinery to aid them – they either coped by primitive means or were forced to leave their country… if at all possible. Through the centuries, in times of open borders, large parts of the population left and never returned. Thus, in a few centuries, the Goranian nation dwindled by a factor of seven, down to about a million inhabitants. For this reason, among others of a domestically-political nature, the government closed the borders. Unilaterally. With kind assistance from their neighbors. Eurasia and Europe, who periodically took turns at adding it to, and then excluding it from their amorphous and often-crumbling unions, were very quick to activate their border force-fields as though they were expecting to be pounced on by their sweetly snoozing brethren.</p>
<p>            Still, for violist Danninger Blagostino there were new, undiscovered horizons in store. His whole life was in front of him. Danny, the name those closest to him used, was a 23-year-old, fresh out of his viola course in the Tronnian Academy of Music. He was a bit of a dreamer, so when he came back from the capital and got accepted into the philharmonic opera orchestra of his home town of Fildion, his very soul was filled with reveries and illustrious visions of the future. He would work on his interpretations of majestic pieces of art, conquer stages, as well as hearts beating within the chests of young instrument players, choristers, and... perhaps, even ballerinas?</p>
<p>            With some trepidation, Danninger headed for the Opera building on his first day at work. He climbed up the steps to the reception hall, all in one breath, opened the door and... froze. Behind the music-stands there stood seemingly depressed, haggard, gray old people. The bowing was languid at best, and the brass section virtually molested their instruments in a fortissimo, taking revenge for the lives they had lost in the depths of artistic wreckage in this Temple of arts. He stepped forward, shoulder slumped, approached the viola group and greeted his colleagues as they politely pointed to his chair and then resumed probing the trickier passages. He took his viola out of its case, tightened the bow and began to practice some sixteenths from the sheets in front of him. He caught one female colleague's eyes as they fixated on him from behind the music stand opposite and sensed that in her view, he was attempting to display unwarranted amounts of virtuosity, so he carried on in a softer tone. The cacophony of sounds was suddenly gone. Danny took the bow off the strings and looked around. An old man with silver hair and sallow skin approached the conductor's stand in a flowing, swan-like gait. He greeted the room almost imperceptibly, opened up the score and shifted his watery gaze up, focusing on Danninger. Had the conductor simply noticed a fresh face among the orchestra? Or was it just that his unusual height that attracted attention? He shuddered. The eyes of a snake were peering straight at him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>            6.</strong> All seven presidents of Arfinia only gathered once or twice a year and then only for strictly-scheduled events. Even during times of war, the last one taking place more than half a century prior, they communicated through the airwaves. Naturally, Tim Shevchenko's six colleagues were rather surprised at his request for an unscheduled face-to-face meeting. He reassured them there was nothing to worry about, that his reasons for assembling the Presidents' Council were not troubling in any way – yet, when they asked him what those reasons actually were, Tim deflected the query. They all knew their eldest colleague well; knew he would not be calling if matters were trivial. Be it with a personal airpod, presidential cosmoplane, or private plain mechanical bicycle, they all hopped to the occasion on time, and, once gathered, hugged each other as was customary. Professor Belk only received handshakes, though just as cordial. Their faces revealed genuine surprise at the presence of the cosmological tech adviser.</p>
<p>            ""My dear colleagues, I apologize if I have disturbed your delicate engagement scheduling,"" Shevchenko started apologetically, yet was reassured by his colleagues' vigorous hand-waving.</p>
<p>            ""Tim,"" president Florence Alberti addressed him with a smile. ""I am curious as to the nature of this emergency gathering. Perhaps we should be holding a classified meeting, no associates?""</p>
<p>            ""No, no need. The nature of this meeting is not sensitive. In fact, I believe it may well become the most transparent matter we've ever ventured to embark upon.""</p>
<p>            ""Come now, my friend, tell us,"" young president Janusz Cordel could hardly contain himself. ""Enough with the solemn secrecy.""</p>
<p>            ""I think you should listen to Alex now. We are gathered here because of an idea of his.""</p>
<p>            More impatient urging followed. Professor Belk, who was not accustomed to feeling tense or uncertain before high-ranking councils or committees, coughed, and the sound carried the vaguest note of hesitation. He spoke in his typical, confident manner, ""I have come upon an idea that is fit for a popular fiction film. If that was my goal, ladies and gentlemen, I would be speaking before executives from Hollywood, back on Earth. I have no connections in the world of cinema, however, thus I am here, where pure reality is forged instead of fantastic entertainment. The notion I wish to present is simple. Let us turn a planet into a functional ship.""</p>
<p>            The presidents chuckled, then stopped to think, which brought to the room the first signs of surprise, approval, and disappointment all together. Then, President Commodore Johan Svenson said earnestly, ""It is an astonishing idea, Alex. I myself have considered something similar. Are we not a couple of centuries too early, however?""</p>
<p>            ""Johan!"" President Anita Hegelman interjected in disbelief. ""Are you being serious?""</p>
<p>            ""I simply appreciate the genius of the thought. It remains to be determined whether it will be at all possible. We need to listen to the Professor's reasoning first.""</p>
<p>            ""Naturally, we will, "" Admiral Giancarlo Ramsi Ramsay chimed in as well. ""Just so you know, in case the end result is of no military advantage, I am against it.""</p>
<p>            ""But, Giancarlo, you are not minister of defense!"" Florence exclaimed. ""And how can you be against anything without having familiarized yourself with it?""</p>
<p>            ""I am expressing my opinion as I am quite familiar with Alex's thought process. He comes forward with ideas only when they benefit the peaceful exploration and taming of space.""</p>
<p>            ""What's wrong with that, then?"" Johan asked, frowning.</p>
<p>            ""Nothing per se. Although… his projects do tend to be a drain on the treasury rather than creating an influx. This is no different, isn't that right, Professor?""</p>
<p>            Alex smiled widely, raised his eyebrows and said jovially, ""Admiral, you have always been a marvelous psychologist. You've hit the nail on the head. More so than you think. Not only would the project be likely to drain Arfinia's military finance, but it would not even be feasible without all major countries on the six planets allotting portions of their budget totals.""</p>
<p>            Anita gasped as if she felt some sharp pain while the rest laughed. Only Timothy Shevchenko sat there akin to a bronze statue, his eyes darting around to take in the expressions of the astonished auditorium of presidents.</p>
<p>            ""Now, I don't mean to say that I have something against this emergency meeting,"" Janusz broke the silence, ""but what exactly is the rush?""</p>
<p>            ""President Cordel,"" Alex looked at him. ""I shall share something most of you aren't aware of.""</p>
<p>            ""Classified?""</p>
<p>            ""Let us say, it has been, up until now, deemed unnecessary to waste your time with incomplete projects.""</p>
<p>            ""Just the same, let us isolate the room,"" Florence said confidently as she pressed the security black-out button. ""So, what is this invention not worthy of our stately time?""</p>
<p>            ""It is not an invention, but a discovery, <i>The Discovery</i>, if you will. We call it a space-warper…""</p>
<p>            ""Not possible!"" Johan stood up from his seat.</p>
<p>            ""Yes, commodore,"" Alex smiled at him triumphantly. ""It very much is. Trials indicate we can do it. We simply have to build it.""</p>
<p>            ""What are you two on about?"" Anita shook her head.</p>
<p>            ""The engine of the future,"" Admiral Ramsay explained in an expertly manner. ""It warps space so that a ship may traverse distances currently considered unattainable. If we can build it, we would be invincible.""</p>
<p>            ""Well, that's all just fine and dandy,"" Janusz interrupted, staring down Alex. ""My question remains. Why go about this with such urgency?""</p>
<p>            ""The engine is so intricate that constructing it is no simple matter. It is also rather expensive. If we were to build one for an ordinary ship, it would be like… strapping an elephant to a toy cart. Or, more like a microscopic cart.""</p>
<p>            ""And since we have our unborn elephant,"" Roberta Hu added playfully. ""We want to build a gilded carriage for it to tow?""</p>
<p>            ""Not precisely, President Hu,"" Shevchenko said at last, speaking in that soft tone he had grown accustomed to during his time as a children's instructor. ""Not a shining carriage fit for nobles or a yacht for the chosen few, but a sturdy, tight raft, filled with the masses, ready to extend the reach of the human species into the Universe. We must not allow this opportunity to slip through our fingers – this nation simply must construct the revolutionary engine as we are the inventors. Or worse still – we must not permit it to be built and then let it collect dust for hundreds of years in some forsaken hangar because there's no ship worthy to be powered by it. We've come up with wind... Why not build that sailboat?""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            <strong>7. </strong>The Cosmographic was the best channel! It was perfect for everyone interested in the Universal goings-on, as well as those who wished to further their media careers in the best way possible. To make it there you had to part with any semblance of residence and become a citizen of the cosmos. To work for Cosmographic Life, you had to denounce yourself. If you were able to come up with a hot story, however, you and your former self would be reunited, and you become king. The ruler of men's hearts, corporate lavishness and all manner of managerial perks at your disposal. Well, Lilana Strombeyer had made it to the first level when she had been appointed two months ago.</p>
<p>            The editor was pulling his hair out, yelling at her, nagging her constantly, over and over again in the same order. The simplicid cam operator would anxiously twitch about, but never dared defend her. And Lilana herself simply stood there, frozen not out of fear, but with astonishment – how was it that they didn't like her downright genius story? She was fully capable of plunging her fist into the editor's repulsive face, but her body was encased in restraining surprise.</p>
<p>            ""Do you have any idea who you're working for?"" the editor raged. ""Does Cosmographic Life ring a bell? Do you happen to know it's the department that airs non-stop live broadcasts from space, that we're part of the most prestigious interplanetary media in the galaxy? Not just news and reports. Entire events! That's what you lot are supposed to be doing.""</p>
<p>            ""But I…""</p>
<p>            ""You?! You, intentionally I might add, did not film a colossal natural explosion that killed two astronauts! You deprived billions of viewers of the opportunity to witness this immense tragedy. What were you thinking? Did you think you were hired to report on a routine survey of some boring planet that may or may not have kiont deposits?""</p>
<p>            ""That's why I pointed…""</p>
<p>            ""Yes, precisely, because you don't have the slightest idea what sensation is, you made your cameraman shoot some slimy critter crawled out of the rocks, one dying of old age! And at the same time! …""</p>
<p>            ""You really don't get it, huh?!"" Lilana erupted.</p>
<p>            ""Uh, you better..."" Her colleague attempted to intervene.</p>
<p>            ""Enough, Rob! He…""</p>
<p>            ""I what?"" the editor leaped forward. ""Did I happen to film some critter's pathetic final gasps instead of the death of two heroes?""</p>
<p>            ""I'm truly sorry, but they weren't …""</p>
<p>            ""You better be sorry… and stop provoking me or I'll be forced to fire you!""</p>
<p>            ""Fine, fire me, but hear me out first.""</p>
<p>            ""Hear you out?! Get out of my sight before I kick you out with my two bare hands.""</p>
<p>            ""Wouldn't you use your feet for that?""</p>
<p>            ""Out!""</p>
<p>            She looked at him like a wild tigress and turned around swiftly.       ""Hey, wait, I haven't given you your next assignment yet!""</p>
<p>            ""Is there going to be one?"" She asked with a sarcastic tone without even turning her head.</p>
<p>            ""I'll give you one last chance.""</p>
<p>            ""Where?""</p>
<p>            ""Hard labor duty."" </p>
<p>             Lilana Strombeyer gave him a disgusted look, turned and stormed our proudly. Such a kind editor! That animal on that empty planet was a total darling compared to him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>            8. </strong>The patient lay on the operating table. His body was burned, face a bloody mess, but he was still breathing. The team of physicians was working efficiently, like a well-oiled machine. They waited while the anesthesia took effect. The nurse then proceeded to pour out a jarful of nanobots which started 'eating' away the charred dead tissue. Some five minutes later, the patient's appearance was not unlike a skinned lamb. Doctor Ashrani switched on his laser scalpel and carefully started to separate muscle tissue from the skin and chest. He did the same with the groin, but there wasn't much there left, anyway. When he was done, his assistant commenced to hand him biosynthetic collabren pieces of different sizes and shapes. The surgeon worked quickly, and in a short while, the tissue containers were nearly depleted. He took a large syringe and emptied it into the patient's heart, which caused him to stop breathing. The nurse then pressed a button, and the operating table transformed into a translucent vat. She took a nondescript tube, pointed it toward the vat and filled it with a thick, drab substance. The tiny particles, which floated around in the liquid, started to stick to the patient's body. The vat's logic circuits precisely guided the thousands of specs to the right areas so that they would cover and support the flesh, and soon they formed a see-through film. The circuit switched to a higher voltage on the substance and the patient flinched as his nerve endings connected to the freshly-formed film of skin. The process took about ten more minutes; the body was completely covered with skin, and the turgid goo in the vat slowly became clear, after which it drained away. The vat was a cot again. A short burst of electricity caused the man to recommence his breathing, the first couple of breaths abrupt and wheezy. Doctor Ashrani stuck a tiny electrode in the man's cheekbone and made a few minor adjustments to the face whose shape and color changed as if by magic. He took the needle out and gave his patient a gentle tap on the cheek. The man woke up. His doctor was smiling at him.</p>
<p>            ""Hello there!"" said the surgeon. ""What is your name?""</p>
<p>            ""Janvier Lagrange, why?""</p>
<p>            The Doctor took a small mirror and brought it up to the patient so he could see himself in it.</p>
<p>            ""That's you, isn't it?"" he looked at the patient inquisitively.</p>
<p>            ""I think so.""</p>
<p>            ""And this? Or this?"" the Doctor was pressing buttons, while the features of the man's face shifted with each press.</p>
<p>            ""Oh, fuck! Is all that me?""</p>
<p>            ""Yes.""</p>
<p>            ""And who are you?""</p>
<p>            ""The ones who brought you back. We made a few adjustments, as per your contract. You will get used to controlling the change in a few minutes. You will be impossible to track down.""</p>
<p>            ""How... how come?""</p>
<p>            ""You are now a transformer. Congratulations!""</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>            9. </strong>Alex and Tim said goodbye to the presidents and headed towards the exit. They walked slowly across the spacious corridors, nodded cursory nods to the vast amount of service-people they came across and spoke in subdued, quiet voices.</p>
<p>            ""Al, you really amazed them with your idea, you know that?""</p>
<p>            ""That is… with the utter craziness of my proposal. Hah. Tim, I wouldn't hold it against them if they don't take it very seriously. I plan on patenting the idea right away. Not that anybody is rushing to beat me to it.""</p>
<p>            ""You believe that if somebody thought of it, they wouldn't have the capability of bringing it to fruition and would therefore abstain from protecting it.""</p>
<p>            ""If we don't make it happen, it falls flat on its back.""</p>
<p>            ""Why?""</p>
<p>            ""In years the space-warper will be mass-produced, and nobody will ever think of building and populating a whopping planet just to utilize one of the myriad such engines in existence.""</p>
<p>            ""The device will become commonplace?""</p>
<p>            ""Look what happened to the dark matter drive. It took twenty years for nearly every nation's fleet to make it standard issue, and it was top-secret to begin with.""</p>
<p>            ""I remember the first ship powered by Darkforce drive. When they finally revealed it, it was like showing a multi-module aerotrain during a tram exhibition.""</p>
<p>            ""Commodore Svenson was its captain. There's a man who still has his umbilical. Tied to space, too. He loved the idea.""</p>
<p>            ""Oh, he did, and much more. Trust me, he'll throw everything he can at it. He'll analyze it thoroughly, consider it carefully and study the possibility of making it a reality.""</p>
<p>            ""I thought so too. The man has my hopes riding high. If there's one person who can convince the rest..., forgive me, Tim, but that's…""</p>
<p>            Alex bumped into someone without noticing. He apologized automatically and only then did he realize who it had been. He knew the woman vaguely. He'd run into her in President Central, where she was employed. She was a young, lovely brunette with barely noticeable Asian features. She'd dropped a box of some storage media when they bumped into each other and the pieces were now scattered on the floor like grains of unground black pepper. Alex leaned down to help her gather her things.</p>
<p>            ""Nora,"" Tim addressed her with a smile, ""I'll leave my friend to deal with the consequences of his absentmindedness.""</p>
<p>            ""I'm terribly sorry, president Shevchenko. I…""</p>
<p>            ""Not your fault, young lady, don't apologize. Al, I'll be contacting you soon. We need to go over our next move. I'll be going now. My wife is waiting. Bye-bye.""</p>
<p>            ""Bye, Mr. President. All the best to Anna and your family. Oh, here's the last one…""</p>
<p>            ""One more over there, and there…""</p>
<p>            ""Any idea how many of them there were?""</p>
<p>            ""No, I'm just carrying some folders over from the Head Secretary's office. I was going to the info center anyway.""</p>
<p>            ""And if we leave one or two behind…?""</p>
<p>            ""… I'll be penalized,"" she finished with a smile.</p>
<p>            ""Well then, I'll have to pay the fine. It <i>is</i> my fault, is it not?""</p>
<p>            ""No, no. I was just being funny. I wouldn't actually be in trouble.""</p>
<p>            ""Ha. Good one. By the way… I'm Alexander Belk, nice to meet you.""</p>
<p>            ""Nora Lang.""</p>
<p>            ""If people celebrated every chance encounter, happiness would be humanity's never-failing companion.""</p>
<p>            ""Sorry?""</p>
<p>            ""I'm inviting you to a drink.""</p>
<p>            ""Why?""</p>
<p>            ""Because I'd like to take care of the fine you won't be getting.</p>
<p>            ""That's a very interesting way of putting it. What do you do?""</p>
<p>            ""I teach. And you?""</p>
<p>            ""The assistant pool. Archiving.""</p>
<p>            ""When do you get off work?""</p>
<p>            ""Well, he-he, in five minutes.""</p>
<p>            ""Really now, he-he! Shall I wait for you out front?""</p>
<p>            ""I'll be there in a minute. Think about where you're taking me to pay up.""</p>

Additionally, 10% of all pledges collected within the first three days will also go towards advertisement for this project!!! Regardless of whether this project reaches its financing goal or not, each of our supporters will receive an e-book for their reading pleasure and a special web certificate within a month of supporting us. You can read the first twenty pages of the novel below! Greetings, dear friends!I know what you’re thinking. “This guy is out of his mind, setting a goal like that!” Please, read on, and you’ll see I’m not *that* crazy. ;)Who am I? Just an ordinary guy with a big dream. Don’t they say that you’re as big as your dreams? Something like that, anyway ;)My name is Dobromir Ivanov, though I tend to write under the pen name of Dob Vans. I am a classically trained musician; I play the viola. I worked in an opera theater for fifteen years, and I currently own a small business while I make different kinds of art. I live in Bulgarian, Europe, and am fully aware of how difficult it is to publish stuff written by an author from such a small country, even if they specifically have the western reading audience in mind. In the novel at hand, there is nothing bound by region or conviction. Well, perhaps just a gentle whiff of my home country.***Dear friends,Since my end goal is colossal - $100 million to finance the creation of a high-budget film adaptation of PLANET SHIP 1 – PREDATORY FOG – I will need to be backed by quite a lot of people. So, to better reach a wider audience, some of which may kindly and graciously become backers, I will need to popularize my idea. The more people come across this project, the more likely it is that it will gain more supporters and backers.So, in one project, I’ve separated the pledge options into two. The SMALL project aims to gather traction for the BIG project, which I have described below. Those of you who believe in the success of this project and back me within the first three days after the project launch date will receive a special perk – a digitized version of one of my paintings, signed for the respective SPECIAL BACKER.First, I’d like to thank each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart – I thank all of you who decide to back and share my project with friends! I want you to know that, if we, you and me, manage to turn my novel  PLANET SHIP 1 – PREDATORY FOG into a big blockbuster movie, you will have been the main reason for this being possible!! Thank you all!   PREDATORY FOG is the first novel of the PLANET SHIP series and features everything a big Hollywood production requires. The plot is highly dynamic, the characters are varied and interesting, and, naturally, there are plenty of twists and turns. You’ll get to see future tech the likes of which have not been featured in science fiction. Espionage, adventure, genuine human relationships, love, war, breathtaking space vistas, colossal construction projects and new, amazing weaponry. Galactic skirmishes, arena fights between people with muscles of iron and artificial creatures. The novel has been written as a, if you will, glimpse into the future. That is, it treats fiction as a plausible progression of what we know to be true. This piece of science fiction is as much about science as it is about humanity.
The plot spans some five-hundred pages, taking place around the year 2569. Humanity has spread to six planets throughout the galaxy, yet, its innate adventurous spirit drives it to search for ever greater and faster means of travel and more ways of conquering the Universe. A genius inventor comes up with a way to achieve just that – a planet, which can function as an enormous space vessel. However, evil forces lead by a fanatical dictator will aggressively intervene and seek to take over the greatest achievement of the united human species. Only an individual of unique qualities and abilities can help neutralize the space-faring threat. But where can such an individual be found? How is he or she to be recruited for the noble cause?
From the very beginning, I thought of the book, and eventually wrote it, as a dramatized movie script. While I worked on it, I could picture the various scenes – real, fleshed out, as if they were happening right in front of my eyes. This is why the chapters are usually short and lead into one another like quick film edits.
The book is not intended only for fans of the Sci-Fi genre. A number of my friends, all from different walks of life, interests and social strata have thus far read and like it quite a bit.
This is not just science fiction. It is my best guess as to what things will be like fife hundred years into the future in all facets of life. In its pages, readers will encounter a veritable bubbling volcano of relationships, passion and real characters – love, hate, friendship, betrayal, hypocrisy, lies, naivety, lust for power, despotism, manipulativeness and subordination, ambition and domination, treachery and honesty, willingness to suffer and egoism. All fundamental components of a society, regardless of whether we locate said society in medieval times, today, or a couple of centuries in the future.
You may ask, “Why not publish it back home?” Well, that’s something of a tall order in my country, unless, of course, you’ve already established yourself and have stable financial backing. And, as I said, the novel is meant for a global audience. Ideally, there will be copies of it from the North Pole all the way down to Antarctica. Publishing houses here don’t have the resources for that sort of thing, and there aren’t many agencies who introduce local authors internationally. I was told that western publishers aren’t really all that interested in authors from my general geographic whereabouts. I have no clue why. Is it the way locals have presented themselves on the international stage or because of some prejudice? Honestly, I don’t know, but that publishing employee turned out to be right. I wrote to a few big agencies, but I never heard back. I’m no Stephen King or Michael Chrichton. Definitely no Donald Trump or Putin. I actually have no idea how an agency chooses their clients based on a short letter and (when they *do* ask for a text sample) ten or so pages of a novel. Whether a person is popular or not is definitely part of the equation. Sometimes I wonder how many great works are just gathering dust in the dusky drawers of their creators?!
Meanwhile, I approached a major documentary network about possibly creating a killer of an ad film based on my novel, since their name, logo design, activity can be a notable element in the production. It was in there, in the plot, a key component from the very beginning. I was told that such a venture was “not part of their programming plans.” I even tried to contact Elon Musk, since he is obviously a visionary, dreamer, and citizen of the cosmos in general, to try and introduce him to my book, but to no avail. Same thing with Neil deGrasse Tyson. I wrote to the Bulgarian representatives of a big film and TV production corporation – no response. I could go on, but I trust the point has been made.
This is where I should clarify why I’m not seeking to self-publish via physical media. It’s simple. If I set a goal of $5,000 and reach that, I could print (at a price of  $10 per copy) five hundred copies! I’d need more just to thank my backers! Let’s say I set a much higher goal and succeed? How would that benefit my future development? Isn’t that what crowdfunding is for? Do I need to reimagine myself and qualify as my novel’s production line? What market should I aim it at? How do I deal with delivery etc. That, I believe, should be left to the professionals, while the creators… create away.
And so, I’m aiming high. My dream is to have a big Hollywood movie made on the basis of my novel, and I’m certain that no major studio would scoff at a $100,000,000. That, in my mind, is the budget required for a worthwhile production. Also, I’m not just going to give that money away to a studio. Even if I’m not a producer per se, I’m definitely taking an active part in the creative process for my novel’s adaptation.
My dear future backers, this project might seem unfeasible, even delusional, I know. Yet, I am convinced that a belief in oneself is the first step to accomplishing ANY task. There is a saying in Bulgaria, which roughly translates into “gathered and united, people can even lift a mountain.” In other words, unity makes strength. Take on the challenge so that we can all be proud of our common deed! Share the project with your friends, let us be the driving force behind a fearsome wave of creative life force. When George Lucas made the original Star Wars, he had no notion of how successful his passion project would become. He must have stood at the door of the movie theater after that first projection, waiting to examine the expressions on the faces of the departing patrons. How deeply excited he must have been to see them not departing, but lining up again to buy another ticket!
I believe that you’re here not to simply buy another book. I know that you want to greenlight human creativity, so that more pieces that result from that creativity may belong to humanity, even if that means opposing those who are in control of humanity’s resources. Each of you will be rewarded with a little piece that will hopefully remain with you as a monument to generosity. Most important of all, you will be left with the indelible knowledge of having made possible something awesome!
The novel wasn’t written with 7.5 billion people in mind. Some of you, after you back the project and receive your copies will, no doubt, not find it to your liking. What I hope, though, is that you’ll enjoy supporting a wacky dreamer who dares meddle in the world of the all-mighty players and hopes to change it for the better, even if it’s just a tiny, tiny change.
I am fully cognizant of what it means to undertake such a project, and I truly believe that it will be successful world-wide. After all, I’m not going into this all alone. I am beyond certain that among those reading this, there is a sufficient number of kindred spirits and supporters. I’d just like to say, at this point, thank you!
I’ve not been alone up to this point during all my years in the creative netherworld. There are a number of people, my friends, without whose help and support this project would not be possible. I would like to express my unending gratitude to my most selfless supporters.
Lyubomir Petkov – attorney

Dessimir Zakov – musician and businessman

Atanas Dikov – owner of a printing center
Svetlana Dinkova – accountant
Petar Vasilev – engineer
Ivailo Kavaldjiev – businessman

They all helped me while I was writing the novel.
 
The novel itself is finished and the text has been translated into English. A huge thanks to my incredible translator, editor, and friend, Vadim Banev – faculty member of the English Linguistics and Literature department in the Paisii Hilendarski University, Plovdiv, Bulgaria.
 
Naturally, I am in no way stopping. I’m currently writing the second volume in the trilogy, and it’s going great. Over a hundred chapters so far, with the entire plot already finalized in my head. After all, we have the second movie to think about, don’t we? ;)
 
A few clarifications:
 
Predatory Fog is not being distributed commercially, and nobody but me has the authority to do so. To officially claim my rights as the author of a book with a unique ISBN, I’ve self-published the original Bulgarian text in a small number of paperback copies, and have offered the first of seven parts of the English translation as an e-book purchase option on a popular e-commerce platform.
 
Each of our supporters will receive the entirety of the English translation as an e-book shortly after pledging, along with a special electronic certificate, which features cover art. The latter is suitable for larger scale prints and framing.
 
A portion of the funds I manage to collect as a result of this campaign will be set aside to publish the novel. I’m looking for a small and reliable publishing house that will be willing to give me a chance. This is not going to be a quick or easy process, so I can’t promise you printed copies just yet. Once the novel has been published, I plan to send a signed copy to the top 1000 backers.
 
If I do reach my goal $100 million, the top 100 will also receive a custom, personalized statuette in the Planet Ship design style, which will bear the respective backers’ names; a kind of personal little academy award.
 
I honestly don’t know whether a big movie company would be willing to have my top backers on set to enjoy the filming process, but I intend to fight for the inclusion of a such a clause in any potential contracts. My top ten backers would then be able to join me on location in Hollywood or wherever the movie is being made.
 
I’ve also come up with a unique gift for some of supporters, to be chosen randomly – a drawing I’ve made myself in an avant-garde aesthetic, which features a stylized signature. I can’t really say how long each of the drawings will take to produce, since I only draw when inspiration really pummels me hard and out of nowhere, so I can’t really give you details on that gift as far as numbers and dates.
Since some would ask what I’d be using the money for if I don’t reach my goal of $100 million, I’ve included a small map, if you will, of how I intend to proceed depending on what portion of the intended financing is collected.
 
From $60 million to $100 million – a big-budget film
From $20 million to $60 million – an impressive series
From $1 million to $20 million – a miniseries featuring the first few episodes of larger series
From $100,000 to $1 million – seeking co-financing from a producer
From $20,000 to $100,000 – self-publishing of the novel, advertisement campaigns for said novel
From $5,000 to $20,000 – working with a publishing house to get the novel out there
From $3 to $5,000 – popularizing of PREDATORY FOG, since, naturally, the book can’t just sit there on a shelf and gather dust!
 
And now, I would kindly direct you to go back and look at the first entry in this list! ;)
Dear friends,
It would be an immense pleasure to have you on the team that can make my dream come true! I sincerely thank you for your attention and wish you robust health and good fortune in everything you do.
 
To better understand what you might be getting yourself into, I’d like to invite you to read the first twenty pages of the novel here.

The boy was playing in the sandbox in front of the apartment building. His father observed him – the smile on his face twitching in an unconscious impulse of pride and tenderness. His son had constructed a couple of sand hills, apparently a proxy for the glorious palace in the boy's mind. The child rose and glanced at his father, whose entire being exuded a kind of singular sense of triumph. The boy stretched out with his hands, laughed in anticipation of the father's approval, but was too late. The man stood up from the bench and started forward, arms stretched out as well. As he walked, a dark shadowy mass came in and dimmed the sunlight. He looked up and froze on the spot; his face contorted in a grimace of horror. The flying object obstructing the sun hovered, immobile, above the open areas between the apartment buildings. The boy followed his father's gaze and immediately turned to him with bewildered, questioning eyes. Before the father could move even slightly, a lightning-white flash struck him. The man turned gray, much like concrete, and was literally rendered into stone in seconds – then fell apart into countless tiny particles. What seemed like grains of fine sand settled on the concrete slab the man had been standing on. The boy just stood there, confused. His eyes filled with tears as he started to sob and look around. There was no soul in sight; he was all alone amid the palpable workday afternoon silence. He looked up. The sun's rays caressed his cheeks glistening with teardrops. Once again he focused on the small pile of sand on the playground. He leaned down, took his bucket and toy spade, approached, tripping and stumbling along the way, knelt and began collecting his father's ashes.
 
 
PART ONE
GHOSTLY AID
 
 
            1.Professor Alexander Belk was so amazed at the idea that had just bloomed in his mind that he nearly spilled his coffee. It was early in the afternoon on December 10, 2569 of the Standard Interplanetary Calendar. In what constituted a small wonder, the Professor was currently enjoying a brief period of no meetings or arrangements, so he made the most of his break out in the open air. He sat alone at a table in the café overseeing the Third strait of Swan city, enjoying the gentle sunshine of the local star Lan. His thoughts fired rapidly, flowing into each other like dissimilar layers of fog and mist. He pictured the lecture hall, full of students, not much younger than himself. Then he dove into deep thought about how necessary it was for him to finally stir up his monotonous, orderly scholar being by means of the affections of some interesting young lass. He then decided to leave such burdensome contemplation behind and let himself focus on what he loved most – fantasizing about space exploration, the future of civilization, even considering the notion of universal dissemination of the human species. The last subject was something he came back to quite often. No, it couldn't be done with ships. Even if said ships could house hundreds of thousands of individuals. The distances which had to be traversed and the amounts of time that would take were so great that no artificially-manufactured society of beings would be able to cope without succumbing to self-annihilation. What is more, nothing could justify using the newly-discovered engine technology, known only to a small number of scientists and high-ranking politicians on Arfinia, in a simple space-faring vessel. The so-called space-warper was a discovery of colossal importance; producing an actual working engine based on the technology would take immense resources, the likes of which even his own homeland would not be able to spare, in spite of being the most powerful state on all six habitable planets.
            Alex tasted his coffee as he reached this point in his contemplation and … The image came to him without warning, striking and clear. Not just an idea, but an entirely functional system of analysis, concept, and implementation. His hands twitched but Alex overcame the urge without spilling a single drop of the precious fragrant liquid. He looked around, saw nobody was paying attention and stood up. He leaned on the railings and gazed into the wave-like structure of the strait splitting the continent in two. He took in a few breaths of fresh air, looked wistfully at the emerald-green sky of Grenaira, sighed a sigh of affirmation and set his body phone to dial mode. The cerebral impulses of the answering party responded, but there was no voice on the line. Probably not the best time or place to talk, yet listening was obviously an option. Alex smiled, his face taking on a provocative expression. He caressed his stubble and declared triumphantly, ""Planet ships! But, don't mind me, please, carry on with your ever-so-important affairs of state, he-he-he ...""
 
            2. Timothy Shevchenko sat at the Round table where the Interplanetary Council of leaders was holding session. The place chosen for the meeting was a middling hall some ten floors above the Mahmuldar congress center, Mahmuldar being the leading state on the planet Saa. On this specific occasion it was Timothy's go at representing Grenaira. He was selected from a pool of the seven presidents of Arfinia and leaders of other, smaller states. Earth's representative had been speaking when Timothy received the call. He waited, rather impatiently, for the speech to be over, so as to make use of the small break window that would follow.
            He retired to the room assigned to him and immediately activated his holographic monitor to contact Belk. The Professor popped up on the screen, grinning a ridiculously wide grin.
            ""Quite the meeting, I take it?"" he stated inquisitively.
            ""Young man, have you thought this through?"" Shevchenko started, not skipping a beat. ""Or are you just keeping yourself busy and wasting my time with science fiction?""
            ""Through? I haven't thought at all,"" the Professor added, maintaining his upbeat delivery, ""the whole thing just materialized in my head. The whole system, Mr. President, a completed project, down to the smallest detail.""
            ""You believe it would be feasible for us to execute?""
            ""Depends on what you mean by us.""
            ""Right, so we can't do it alone. Hm, a planet ship you say, Al?""
            ""A planet ship.""
            ""Quite the idea. Probably in the quadrillion ballpark...""
            ""More like quintillion, Tim.""
 
            3. The dissemination of humans was not a new idea. The subject had been considered current ever since Homo sapiens had taken its first steps and haughtily looked down upon all other creatures roaming the African plains of its homeworld. Not long after, at least on the immensely grand scale of time itself, the nascent species conquered and populated its planet. It was not enough, however, and humans looked up at the stars. In 2171 a human astronaut stepped on a habitable alien planet for the first time. This opened the proverbial floodgates for the little green planet. Grenaira became humanity's second home. Slowly but surely, space exploration went further and further, and throughout the centuries, thousands of ships criss-crossed the galaxy, discovering ever more twins of old Earth. The number of human beings grew incessantly, and there was no lack of enthusiastic volunteers who wanted to settle, start anew, throw away the shackles of one gravity index for another. Regardless of the motives of any single individual, by the end of the 25th century human civilization consisted of six planets, perfectly suited for life, as well as hundreds of less hospitable colonies which provided an endless supply of valuable natural resources, built upon sparsely populated asteroids and planetoids.
            And even though there was sufficient space for billions more humans on these worlds, even though they could feed many generations to come, even though the members of the societies there could traverse distances, which just a few hundred years prior might have seemed unthinkable, to visit their brethren from light-years away, there were, nevertheless, people who never stopped dreaming of taming more of the frontier. Just like the man who had constructed the first raft and sailed Earth's oceans to colonize another continent, there were modern humans who dreamed of building ships to lead humanity to other galaxies. Nobody had gone beyond the Milky Way as of yet. That is, unless one believed the numerous myths and legends of astronaut folklore.
            Some insisted that man had not yet matured enough to travel the distances between galaxies, and that such a thing could not happen before humanity developed into whatever evolution had in store for it. Others were convinced that very thing had already happened. Or just about, at least. They claimed a transitional species had existed for a long time – a species worthy of investing one's hopes in, capable of making that great leap – Cyborgs.
            Actually, in that period during the second half of the 26th century a great deal of humans could be classified as such as well, in spite of most not accepting or approving of it. They thought it brought them lower somehow, to be nothing more than an ordinary robot, a construct, not that dissimilar to some household appliance, a vacuum cleaner or what have you. Yet, they had no reason to be ashamed of what they were. The scientific advances of cybernetics had made it possible to elevate the species. It was not just that human beings became sick less often and lived twice as long as their 21st century counterparts; they could enhance the scope and abilities of their very intellect. Those who chose to have their heart replaced, their skeletal framework strengthened, or have their mental capacity increased via artificial additions, were not in any way opposed to these improvements. Still, they did not wish to be referred to as cyborgs. And with good reason, too; a simple explanation that was evident and valid on its own merit. That reason was the Cyborg Society.
            In the beginning, hundreds of years ago, it was not a true organization. More of a club of extravagant, eccentric individuals from different parts of the worlds. They were proud of the chips and circuits they integrated into their bodies to ""shine the way for science"", as they usually phrased it. As centuries passed, installing internal components and adding external ones into the human biology became mass practice. Post-2550, body modules were manufactured from predominantly organic materials and could scarcely be differentiated from natural organs. Almost, that is, as every scanner contrasted the two like puddles of water in the sand. Of course, nobody wanted to conceal the presence of such acquisitions as it was no different from having an artificial tooth in the old days. However, throughout the entirety of the history of cybernetics, there were those individuals who paraded their more advanced and costlier physical and mental enhancements, looking down on the common man.
            Gradually, people who liked the title of cyborg created their own organized hierarchical structure. They considered themselves superior to humans, apparently fancied themselves an entirely new species. Bit by bit, they began to stray from the rest of humanity, started to gather in their own groups and parties, finally forming a wholly separate society. One of Cyborgs, the Cyborg Society. Later on, they would leave behind the ""gravitational confines"", as they called planets, and live aboard their city ships. Only a small amount of humans were aware of this, while the masses were blissfully oblivious to such goings-on. They knew of the Society in as much as they knew they were not part of it and its unfounded claims of superiority. What business was it of theirs that there was this faction, imaginary or not, of peculiar and pathologically-deviant minds, thank you very much!
 
            4. Tsar Fog de Berg sat in his private upgrade clinic. The Doctor added the final lubial neuron, connected it to the synapses and psychodorms by means of a microbiosuture and, satisfied with his work, smiled at the Ruler. He, in turn, frowned in approval, and the Doctor applied the new strip of enhancing cortex tissue. Then he reattached the bone, fixed the scalp and irradiated the area with a ciffisian lamp to let the tissue grow back. Yet another regal cerebral upgrade was completed. De Berg smiled, seemingly at himself. Now he truly possessed the most powerful intellect in known space. He looked at himself in the mirror. Handsome too! Such a broad, manly brow. Now his head was worth over a trillion arfins (or Bergs, Fog corrected himself), not counting the unquantifiable aesthetic value it held. The best part was only he could make use of it, so no one would be tempted to take it away from him. Tsar Fog de Berg was so content that he did not even allow for the possibility of there being someone, who, like that, for the hell of it, would like to just blow up this jewel of the biocybernetic medical arts. Yet, he reminded himself that some devious foe could potentially break into the tacit corner of his artificial memory. That was only possible with the competent aid of the very physician who completed the update, who, as it happened, was just taking off his operating gown. The Tsar sighed in utter vexation and demolecularized him right to the floor. The sanitary robot sucked up the remnants of the physician (and his illustrious career), and deposited them into the trash compartment, where they were swiftly blown into space. Disgusted, Fog rubbed away a stray ashy particle from his eye. He contemplated whether it was possible for the discarded dust to be the spark to some proto-life and its ensuing evolutionary process, should it happen upon the right planet.
 
            5. Far from all those innovative, technologically-endowed corners of space, the state of Gorania pulsed with its own steady life beats. For millennia, it had remained uncared-for in a distant corner of Europe, Earth, and ultimately, of history. The ancient country had been witness to centuries of upward and downward surges, and now, at the end of the 26th century, had subsided into lethargy, the likes of which it had not experienced even during the countless times of being annexed, conquered, and having its borders redrawn. Nobody attacked anymore, for the values they once held dear were twisted, long-gone, to be replaced by those of outsiders. Well, there were still beautiful, unsullied swaths of nature to be sure, but those could be found in many different countries, on many different planets. And so, Gorania rested in its vegetative state, somewhere along the border between the rest of Europe and the member-nations of the Eurasian Union, undisturbed in its sublime backward-mindedness.
            A scarce but tough people lived there. They had learned to survive among their peers, which was no small feat in and of itself. Goranians were accustomed to being dependent on nobody but their closest; they didn't have any newfangled technology or machinery to aid them – they either coped by primitive means or were forced to leave their country… if at all possible. Through the centuries, in times of open borders, large parts of the population left and never returned. Thus, in a few centuries, the Goranian nation dwindled by a factor of seven, down to about a million inhabitants. For this reason, among others of a domestically-political nature, the government closed the borders. Unilaterally. With kind assistance from their neighbors. Eurasia and Europe, who periodically took turns at adding it to, and then excluding it from their amorphous and often-crumbling unions, were very quick to activate their border force-fields as though they were expecting to be pounced on by their sweetly snoozing brethren.
            Still, for violist Danninger Blagostino there were new, undiscovered horizons in store. His whole life was in front of him. Danny, the name those closest to him used, was a 23-year-old, fresh out of his viola course in the Tronnian Academy of Music. He was a bit of a dreamer, so when he came back from the capital and got accepted into the philharmonic opera orchestra of his home town of Fildion, his very soul was filled with reveries and illustrious visions of the future. He would work on his interpretations of majestic pieces of art, conquer stages, as well as hearts beating within the chests of young instrument players, choristers, and... perhaps, even ballerinas?
            With some trepidation, Danninger headed for the Opera building on his first day at work. He climbed up the steps to the reception hall, all in one breath, opened the door and... froze. Behind the music-stands there stood seemingly depressed, haggard, gray old people. The bowing was languid at best, and the brass section virtually molested their instruments in a fortissimo, taking revenge for the lives they had lost in the depths of artistic wreckage in this Temple of arts. He stepped forward, shoulder slumped, approached the viola group and greeted his colleagues as they politely pointed to his chair and then resumed probing the trickier passages. He took his viola out of its case, tightened the bow and began to practice some sixteenths from the sheets in front of him. He caught one female colleague's eyes as they fixated on him from behind the music stand opposite and sensed that in her view, he was attempting to display unwarranted amounts of virtuosity, so he carried on in a softer tone. The cacophony of sounds was suddenly gone. Danny took the bow off the strings and looked around. An old man with silver hair and sallow skin approached the conductor's stand in a flowing, swan-like gait. He greeted the room almost imperceptibly, opened up the score and shifted his watery gaze up, focusing on Danninger. Had the conductor simply noticed a fresh face among the orchestra? Or was it just that his unusual height that attracted attention? He shuddered. The eyes of a snake were peering straight at him.
 
            6. All seven presidents of Arfinia only gathered once or twice a year and then only for strictly-scheduled events. Even during times of war, the last one taking place more than half a century prior, they communicated through the airwaves. Naturally, Tim Shevchenko's six colleagues were rather surprised at his request for an unscheduled face-to-face meeting. He reassured them there was nothing to worry about, that his reasons for assembling the Presidents' Council were not troubling in any way – yet, when they asked him what those reasons actually were, Tim deflected the query. They all knew their eldest colleague well; knew he would not be calling if matters were trivial. Be it with a personal airpod, presidential cosmoplane, or private plain mechanical bicycle, they all hopped to the occasion on time, and, once gathered, hugged each other as was customary. Professor Belk only received handshakes, though just as cordial. Their faces revealed genuine surprise at the presence of the cosmological tech adviser.
            ""My dear colleagues, I apologize if I have disturbed your delicate engagement scheduling,"" Shevchenko started apologetically, yet was reassured by his colleagues' vigorous hand-waving.
            ""Tim,"" president Florence Alberti addressed him with a smile. ""I am curious as to the nature of this emergency gathering. Perhaps we should be holding a classified meeting, no associates?""
            ""No, no need. The nature of this meeting is not sensitive. In fact, I believe it may well become the most transparent matter we've ever ventured to embark upon.""
            ""Come now, my friend, tell us,"" young president Janusz Cordel could hardly contain himself. ""Enough with the solemn secrecy.""
            ""I think you should listen to Alex now. We are gathered here because of an idea of his.""
            More impatient urging followed. Professor Belk, who was not accustomed to feeling tense or uncertain before high-ranking councils or committees, coughed, and the sound carried the vaguest note of hesitation. He spoke in his typical, confident manner, ""I have come upon an idea that is fit for a popular fiction film. If that was my goal, ladies and gentlemen, I would be speaking before executives from Hollywood, back on Earth. I have no connections in the world of cinema, however, thus I am here, where pure reality is forged instead of fantastic entertainment. The notion I wish to present is simple. Let us turn a planet into a functional ship.""
            The presidents chuckled, then stopped to think, which brought to the room the first signs of surprise, approval, and disappointment all together. Then, President Commodore Johan Svenson said earnestly, ""It is an astonishing idea, Alex. I myself have considered something similar. Are we not a couple of centuries too early, however?""
            ""Johan!"" President Anita Hegelman interjected in disbelief. ""Are you being serious?""
            ""I simply appreciate the genius of the thought. It remains to be determined whether it will be at all possible. We need to listen to the Professor's reasoning first.""
            ""Naturally, we will, "" Admiral Giancarlo Ramsi Ramsay chimed in as well. ""Just so you know, in case the end result is of no military advantage, I am against it.""
            ""But, Giancarlo, you are not minister of defense!"" Florence exclaimed. ""And how can you be against anything without having familiarized yourself with it?""
            ""I am expressing my opinion as I am quite familiar with Alex's thought process. He comes forward with ideas only when they benefit the peaceful exploration and taming of space.""
            ""What's wrong with that, then?"" Johan asked, frowning.
            ""Nothing per se. Although… his projects do tend to be a drain on the treasury rather than creating an influx. This is no different, isn't that right, Professor?""
            Alex smiled widely, raised his eyebrows and said jovially, ""Admiral, you have always been a marvelous psychologist. You've hit the nail on the head. More so than you think. Not only would the project be likely to drain Arfinia's military finance, but it would not even be feasible without all major countries on the six planets allotting portions of their budget totals.""
            Anita gasped as if she felt some sharp pain while the rest laughed. Only Timothy Shevchenko sat there akin to a bronze statue, his eyes darting around to take in the expressions of the astonished auditorium of presidents.
            ""Now, I don't mean to say that I have something against this emergency meeting,"" Janusz broke the silence, ""but what exactly is the rush?""
            ""President Cordel,"" Alex looked at him. ""I shall share something most of you aren't aware of.""
            ""Classified?""
            ""Let us say, it has been, up until now, deemed unnecessary to waste your time with incomplete projects.""
            ""Just the same, let us isolate the room,"" Florence said confidently as she pressed the security black-out button. ""So, what is this invention not worthy of our stately time?""
            ""It is not an invention, but a discovery, The Discovery, if you will. We call it a space-warper…""
            ""Not possible!"" Johan stood up from his seat.
            ""Yes, commodore,"" Alex smiled at him triumphantly. ""It very much is. Trials indicate we can do it. We simply have to build it.""
            ""What are you two on about?"" Anita shook her head.
            ""The engine of the future,"" Admiral Ramsay explained in an expertly manner. ""It warps space so that a ship may traverse distances currently considered unattainable. If we can build it, we would be invincible.""
            ""Well, that's all just fine and dandy,"" Janusz interrupted, staring down Alex. ""My question remains. Why go about this with such urgency?""
            ""The engine is so intricate that constructing it is no simple matter. It is also rather expensive. If we were to build one for an ordinary ship, it would be like… strapping an elephant to a toy cart. Or, more like a microscopic cart.""
            ""And since we have our unborn elephant,"" Roberta Hu added playfully. ""We want to build a gilded carriage for it to tow?""
            ""Not precisely, President Hu,"" Shevchenko said at last, speaking in that soft tone he had grown accustomed to during his time as a children's instructor. ""Not a shining carriage fit for nobles or a yacht for the chosen few, but a sturdy, tight raft, filled with the masses, ready to extend the reach of the human species into the Universe. We must not allow this opportunity to slip through our fingers – this nation simply must construct the revolutionary engine as we are the inventors. Or worse still – we must not permit it to be built and then let it collect dust for hundreds of years in some forsaken hangar because there's no ship worthy to be powered by it. We've come up with wind... Why not build that sailboat?""
 
            7. The Cosmographic was the best channel! It was perfect for everyone interested in the Universal goings-on, as well as those who wished to further their media careers in the best way possible. To make it there you had to part with any semblance of residence and become a citizen of the cosmos. To work for Cosmographic Life, you had to denounce yourself. If you were able to come up with a hot story, however, you and your former self would be reunited, and you become king. The ruler of men's hearts, corporate lavishness and all manner of managerial perks at your disposal. Well, Lilana Strombeyer had made it to the first level when she had been appointed two months ago.
            The editor was pulling his hair out, yelling at her, nagging her constantly, over and over again in the same order. The simplicid cam operator would anxiously twitch about, but never dared defend her. And Lilana herself simply stood there, frozen not out of fear, but with astonishment – how was it that they didn't like her downright genius story? She was fully capable of plunging her fist into the editor's repulsive face, but her body was encased in restraining surprise.
            ""Do you have any idea who you're working for?"" the editor raged. ""Does Cosmographic Life ring a bell? Do you happen to know it's the department that airs non-stop live broadcasts from space, that we're part of the most prestigious interplanetary media in the galaxy? Not just news and reports. Entire events! That's what you lot are supposed to be doing.""
            ""But I…""
            ""You?! You, intentionally I might add, did not film a colossal natural explosion that killed two astronauts! You deprived billions of viewers of the opportunity to witness this immense tragedy. What were you thinking? Did you think you were hired to report on a routine survey of some boring planet that may or may not have kiont deposits?""
            ""That's why I pointed…""
            ""Yes, precisely, because you don't have the slightest idea what sensation is, you made your cameraman shoot some slimy critter crawled out of the rocks, one dying of old age! And at the same time! …""
            ""You really don't get it, huh?!"" Lilana erupted.
            ""Uh, you better..."" Her colleague attempted to intervene.
            ""Enough, Rob! He…""
            ""I what?"" the editor leaped forward. ""Did I happen to film some critter's pathetic final gasps instead of the death of two heroes?""
            ""I'm truly sorry, but they weren't …""
            ""You better be sorry… and stop provoking me or I'll be forced to fire you!""
            ""Fine, fire me, but hear me out first.""
            ""Hear you out?! Get out of my sight before I kick you out with my two bare hands.""
            ""Wouldn't you use your feet for that?""
            ""Out!""
            She looked at him like a wild tigress and turned around swiftly.       ""Hey, wait, I haven't given you your next assignment yet!""
            ""Is there going to be one?"" She asked with a sarcastic tone without even turning her head.
            ""I'll give you one last chance.""
            ""Where?""
            ""Hard labor duty."" 
             Lilana Strombeyer gave him a disgusted look, turned and stormed our proudly. Such a kind editor! That animal on that empty planet was a total darling compared to him.
 
            8. The patient lay on the operating table. His body was burned, face a bloody mess, but he was still breathing. The team of physicians was working efficiently, like a well-oiled machine. They waited while the anesthesia took effect. The nurse then proceeded to pour out a jarful of nanobots which started 'eating' away the charred dead tissue. Some five minutes later, the patient's appearance was not unlike a skinned lamb. Doctor Ashrani switched on his laser scalpel and carefully started to separate muscle tissue from the skin and chest. He did the same with the groin, but there wasn't much there left, anyway. When he was done, his assistant commenced to hand him biosynthetic collabren pieces of different sizes and shapes. The surgeon worked quickly, and in a short while, the tissue containers were nearly depleted. He took a large syringe and emptied it into the patient's heart, which caused him to stop breathing. The nurse then pressed a button, and the operating table transformed into a translucent vat. She took a nondescript tube, pointed it toward the vat and filled it with a thick, drab substance. The tiny particles, which floated around in the liquid, started to stick to the patient's body. The vat's logic circuits precisely guided the thousands of specs to the right areas so that they would cover and support the flesh, and soon they formed a see-through film. The circuit switched to a higher voltage on the substance and the patient flinched as his nerve endings connected to the freshly-formed film of skin. The process took about ten more minutes; the body was completely covered with skin, and the turgid goo in the vat slowly became clear, after which it drained away. The vat was a cot again. A short burst of electricity caused the man to recommence his breathing, the first couple of breaths abrupt and wheezy. Doctor Ashrani stuck a tiny electrode in the man's cheekbone and made a few minor adjustments to the face whose shape and color changed as if by magic. He took the needle out and gave his patient a gentle tap on the cheek. The man woke up. His doctor was smiling at him.
            ""Hello there!"" said the surgeon. ""What is your name?""
            ""Janvier Lagrange, why?""
            The Doctor took a small mirror and brought it up to the patient so he could see himself in it.
            ""That's you, isn't it?"" he looked at the patient inquisitively.
            ""I think so.""
            ""And this? Or this?"" the Doctor was pressing buttons, while the features of the man's face shifted with each press.
            ""Oh, fuck! Is all that me?""
            ""Yes.""
            ""And who are you?""
            ""The ones who brought you back. We made a few adjustments, as per your contract. You will get used to controlling the change in a few minutes. You will be impossible to track down.""
            ""How... how come?""
            ""You are now a transformer. Congratulations!""
 
            9. Alex and Tim said goodbye to the presidents and headed towards the exit. They walked slowly across the spacious corridors, nodded cursory nods to the vast amount of service-people they came across and spoke in subdued, quiet voices.
            ""Al, you really amazed them with your idea, you know that?""
            ""That is… with the utter craziness of my proposal. Hah. Tim, I wouldn't hold it against them if they don't take it very seriously. I plan on patenting the idea right away. Not that anybody is rushing to beat me to it.""
            ""You believe that if somebody thought of it, they wouldn't have the capability of bringing it to fruition and would therefore abstain from protecting it.""
            ""If we don't make it happen, it falls flat on its back.""
            ""Why?""
            ""In years the space-warper will be mass-produced, and nobody will ever think of building and populating a whopping planet just to utilize one of the myriad such engines in existence.""
            ""The device will become commonplace?""
            ""Look what happened to the dark matter drive. It took twenty years for nearly every nation's fleet to make it standard issue, and it was top-secret to begin with.""
            ""I remember the first ship powered by Darkforce drive. When they finally revealed it, it was like showing a multi-module aerotrain during a tram exhibition.""
            ""Commodore Svenson was its captain. There's a man who still has his umbilical. Tied to space, too. He loved the idea.""
            ""Oh, he did, and much more. Trust me, he'll throw everything he can at it. He'll analyze it thoroughly, consider it carefully and study the possibility of making it a reality.""
            ""I thought so too. The man has my hopes riding high. If there's one person who can convince the rest..., forgive me, Tim, but that's…""
            Alex bumped into someone without noticing. He apologized automatically and only then did he realize who it had been. He knew the woman vaguely. He'd run into her in President Central, where she was employed. She was a young, lovely brunette with barely noticeable Asian features. She'd dropped a box of some storage media when they bumped into each other and the pieces were now scattered on the floor like grains of unground black pepper. Alex leaned down to help her gather her things.
            ""Nora,"" Tim addressed her with a smile, ""I'll leave my friend to deal with the consequences of his absentmindedness.""
            ""I'm terribly sorry, president Shevchenko. I…""
            ""Not your fault, young lady, don't apologize. Al, I'll be contacting you soon. We need to go over our next move. I'll be going now. My wife is waiting. Bye-bye.""
            ""Bye, Mr. President. All the best to Anna and your family. Oh, here's the last one…""
            ""One more over there, and there…""
            ""Any idea how many of them there were?""
            ""No, I'm just carrying some folders over from the Head Secretary's office. I was going to the info center anyway.""
            ""And if we leave one or two behind…?""
            ""… I'll be penalized,"" she finished with a smile.
            ""Well then, I'll have to pay the fine. It is my fault, is it not?""
            ""No, no. I was just being funny. I wouldn't actually be in trouble.""
            ""Ha. Good one. By the way… I'm Alexander Belk, nice to meet you.""
            ""Nora Lang.""
            ""If people celebrated every chance encounter, happiness would be humanity's never-failing companion.""
            ""Sorry?""
            ""I'm inviting you to a drink.""
            ""Why?""
            ""Because I'd like to take care of the fine you won't be getting.
            ""That's a very interesting way of putting it. What do you do?""
            ""I teach. And you?""
            ""The assistant pool. Archiving.""
            ""When do you get off work?""
            ""Well, he-he, in five minutes.""
            ""Really now, he-he! Shall I wait for you out front?""

<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
<p>Set in early 18th-century Spain, <i>Yad</i> reimagines the life of architect Narciso Tomé and the story of the construction of one of the highest achievements of Spanish Baroque architecture, the El Transparente altar.</p>
<p>During construction, Narciso’s love affair with the wife of Toledo’s public prosecutor leads to a confrontation between the two men that results in the accidental death of the prosecutor. Fearful of being accused of murder by the Inquisition, Narciso abandons the construction of El Transparente and leaves his family behind.</p>
<p>Knowing that Narciso’s disappearance will be interpreted by the Inquisition as an admission of guilt and a death sentence for the remaining family, Narciso’s wife disguises herself as her husband and continues to work on the cathedral. She saves his masterpiece while he is gone, but will she forgive him once he returns?</p>
<p><i>Yad</i> is a fast-paced historical thriller about a man’s search for identity. Featuring fictionalized accounts of historical figures such as the painters Francisco Goya and El Greco, it takes its readers on a tour of 18th-century Toledo, stopping in at marzipan shops, visiting famed Toledo steel blacksmiths, and uncovering an underworld of crime and prostitution. Engaging, funny, cerebral, and touching, <i>Yad</i> is more than a high-concept, historical novel; it is a meditation on betrayal, repentance, forgiveness, and love. </p>
<p> </p>

<p>In the city, where we lay our scene, the streets are narrow and steep. It is easy to stumble, descending them, and tiresome to walk uphill. In the city, where the plot unfolds, the houses are tall and thin. Pressed one beside the other, the rows form ducts, create gaps into which the sun falls only in the afternoon, shining almost vertical. The houses along the street are several levels stacked one above the other, connected by steep stairs, like the rays of the sun at its zenith.</p>
<p>Every street is like fate, every house like faith. But this is a city, not a metaphor.</p>
<p>In the spring, when hot days announce the bullfighting season, canopies are hung above the streets. White canvas sheets, rinsed by rain, dried by heat, like clouds drifting at the height of the tallest floor, they mimic the shape of the streets for the birds.</p>
<p>Is that all?</p>
<p>In the evening… Under the soaring curtains, lamps are hung between houses. Lit at dusk, the lamps turn the streets into tunnels of light, piercing the darkness. They are quenched at bedtime. When the light disappears, the canopies fill with the breath of night, sailing in search of the Golden Fleece or to Ithaca. In the streets, late passers carry lanterns before them, deep-sea fish paying no attention to the sails above their heads, mistaking them for the Milky Way, which nobody will ever measure, whose stardust nobody will ever shake from their feet.</p>
<p>That it?</p>
<p>If you look up, you can read the traces of cat paws and bird feathers, or see a skinny cat who lives only on love and barley.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>There, straight from the open window jumps a barely clothed youth! A flight of triumph? Young like Icarus, but skillful like Daedalus, he balances a moment on the canvas trampoline, then rushes in the direction of the Cathedral. Barefoot, he leaps as though in seven-league boots. His every step is ascension, the moon kissing his sweaty breast through an open shirt. He rises like a balloon of the Montgolfier brothers, like the first plane of the Wright brothers. Flying is a brotherly thing. Jumping too. And further and further, like a cricket, like a grasshopper, like locusts…</p>
<p>Locusts? I should not have used that word. Suddenly, behind his jumping back another figure appears. He runs like an Andalusian dog, fully clothed, heavy boots, an overcoat. What’s this? A sword of Toledo steel, cold and sharp like the moonlight. Stretched out just, just behind the youth’s back:</p>
<p>- Turn around! You coward! You took my—</p>
<p>A thrust! The sword pierces the back of the shirt and emerges through the front. Blood from the youth’s back repeated on his breast. Two stains. Pierced through.</p>
<p>The pursued does not fall. As if he does not notice the strike and the blood, he jumps ahead, leaping over the sagging sheets. Across the Milky Way canopy, he traces a new constellation, composed only of Mars, repeated blotches of red.</p>
<p>The pursuer, after delivering the blow, catches his foot in a seam. There is the sound of tearing cloth, the sheets rip in two and open beneath the feet of the offender, throwing him into the abyss. He grabs an edge with one hand, grips his sword with the other like a precious treasure. The material slips from his grasp and he tumbles onto the lamp below, onto the rope, which he clutches, this time with both hands. The rope rips from one wall and, flying like a pendulum, he slams into the opposing wall—then he falls limply into the street beside his humming sword.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Nobody awoke, no one had seen his fall. The sail above the street swayed to the rhythm of snores. The sky cried a lonely star that leaked into the grave. An auburn shadow crawled from the alley, picked up the blade, which flashed in the darkness, and fled towards the Jewish quarter. And then another shadow and another… The second grabbed the purse and jewels, and the third looked in the robbed man’s face and—like a Good Samaritan—began to howl:</p>
<p>- Help!!!</p>
<p>On the ground, without feeling, lay Don Miguel de Juaclac, the public prosecutor of Toledo. Of the jumping youth, not a trace remained, if you don’t count the red stars on the canvas sky.</p>
<p>Who he was and whose blood this is, nobody will know. Nobody except You and I. Only we know, this leaping youth was named Narciso Tomé. This is his story. Keep it for yourself, as a warning. I don’t have anything to do with it. I’m just telling it.</p>

Prologue from Yad

In the city, where we lay our scene, the streets are narrow and steep. It is easy to stumble, descending them, and tiresome to walk uphill. In the city, where the plot unfolds, the houses are tall and thin. Pressed one beside the other, the rows form ducts, create gaps into which the sun falls only in the afternoon, shining almost vertical. The houses along the street are several levels stacked one above the other, connected by steep stairs, like the rays of the sun at its zenith.
Every street is like fate, every house like faith. But this is a city, not a metaphor.
In the spring, when hot days announce the bullfighting season, canopies are hung above the streets. White canvas sheets, rinsed by rain, dried by heat, like clouds drifting at the height of the tallest floor, they mimic the shape of the streets for the birds.
Is that all?
In the evening… Under the soaring curtains, lamps are hung between houses. Lit at dusk, the lamps turn the streets into tunnels of light, piercing the darkness. They are quenched at bedtime. When the light disappears, the canopies fill with the breath of night, sailing in search of the Golden Fleece or to Ithaca. In the streets, late passers carry lanterns before them, deep-sea fish paying no attention to the sails above their heads, mistaking them for the Milky Way, which nobody will ever measure, whose stardust nobody will ever shake from their feet.
That it?
If you look up, you can read the traces of cat paws and bird feathers, or see a skinny cat who lives only on love and barley.
Oh!
There, straight from the open window jumps a barely clothed youth! A flight of triumph? Young like Icarus, but skillful like Daedalus, he balances a moment on the canvas trampoline, then rushes in the direction of the Cathedral. Barefoot, he leaps as though in seven-league boots.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hello fellow friends, family, and contributors! We are the co-founders of RANT Publishing, Sophie Binns and Eleonora Vaccariello. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We formed a strong bond in college through our love for the social sciences, literature, and a hunger for knowledge. We never shied away from impassioned debates of hot button issues and have always been advocates for social justice. The idea for RANT flourished in the midst of the frenzied political climate during one of the wildest years of everyone’s lives; 2020. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>During this crazy time, we wanted to educate ourselves on various social issues so we chose to seek out books that were written by marginalized groups — It was throughout our searches that we realized the inherent bias that exists within the publishing industry as well as the lack of liable platforms where individuals can seek out informative literature on critical social topics. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>...That’s when the idea for RANT Publishing was born.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RANT Publishing will provide an outlet for authors who seek to promoting powerful content that delves into unorthodox topics such as mental health struggles, immigration, homelessness, racism, and much more. RANT will support the integration of these topics across genres. These can include both fiction and non-fiction, can be blatant or more subtle, and will not discriminate. We vow to value high-quality literature and uplift authors with didactic messages by buttressing their talent and creativity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We’re seeking approximately $15,000 dollars in funding. About 50% of this money will go toward website development costs, marketing and PR, legal fees, and author recruitment. The other 50% will go toward the graphic design electronic book covers, editing, and creating the ebooks themselves. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you contribute, you will receive a package of RANT-branded items. Such as pens, notebooks, stickers, a T-shirt, and out favorite— a chance to win a 1-year subscription to our books!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The underlying goal for RANT Publishing is to educate people and to give a voice to talented, underrepresented artists. If you contribute to our business, you will help give these individuals a safe platform to share their stories. As a bonus, you will also help two young female entrepreneurs reach their dream of owning a business that can make a small, yet important different in the world. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Competing against large companies such as the “big five” and other current eBook publishing platforms will be a trying endeavor. Although a small number of independent publishers are attempting to change the norms of the industry, they lack the scope and outreach that we envision for RANT. Despite the challenges we face, we have come to realize that other individuals, particularly younger generations, have similar aspirations as we do. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>If you are not able to contribute, don’t worry! You will still  be helping us by spreading the word about RANT Publishing and by sharing our campaign.<br/><br/>Thank you everyone for your support!! It means the world to us. We are so excited about this journey, and we cannot wait to bring you some amazing content.</p>

We’re seeking approximately $15,000 dollars in funding. About 50% of this money will go toward website development costs, marketing and PR, legal fees, and author recruitment. The other 50% will go toward the graphic design electronic book covers, editing, and creating the ebooks themselves. 
 
If you contribute, you will receive a package of RANT-branded items. Such as pens, notebooks, stickers, a T-shirt, and out favorite— a chance to win a 1-year subscription to our books!
 
The Impact
The underlying goal for RANT Publishing is to educate people and to give a voice to talented, underrepresented artists. If you contribute to our business, you will help give these individuals a safe platform to share their stories. As a bonus, you will also help two young female entrepreneurs reach their dream of owning a business that can make a small, yet important different in the world. 
 
Risks & Challenges
Competing against large companies such as the “big five” and other current eBook publishing platforms will be a trying endeavor. Although a small number of independent publishers are attempting to change the norms of the industry, they lack the scope and outreach that we envision for RANT. Despite the challenges we face, we have come to realize that other individuals, particularly younger generations, have similar aspirations as we do. 
 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you are not able to contribute, don’t worry! You will still  be helping us by spreading the word about RANT Publishing and by sharing our campaign.Thank you everyone for your support!! It means the world to us. We are so excited about this journey, and we cannot wait to bring you some amazing content.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Dear Friends and Fans of Poetry,</h3>
<p>It is with beaming pride that I'm happy to say that <a href=""http://spookygirlfriendpress.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Spooky Girlfriend Press</a> is turning <strong>ten years old</strong> this year. When I started the press in a basement apartment in Minnesota while earning my MFA, I couldn't imagine the amazing authors I'd get to work with or the stunning quality of poetry I'd have the privilege of releasing. We published Nicole Steinberg's debut, <a href=""http://flavorwire.com/429968/10-of-2013s-best-books-of-poetry/3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Getting Lucky</i></a>. We've published 13 physical chapbooks (including a pizza poem anthology and a non-fiction collection) and three digital titles. We love what we do and we want to GO BIG this year and release another essential collection into the world.</p>

<h3>Help Us Celebrate Our 10-Year Anniversary!</h3>
<p>To celebrate, we want to publish our second full-length collection of poetry by the amazingly talented Amber Nelson. Many of you may recognize Amber as one of the driving forces behind the much beloved (and missed) <a href=""http://www.alicebluereview.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">alice blue</a>. But in addition to promoting the work of others, Amber is a great poet in her own right and we think her book, <i>The Sexiest Man Alive</i>, will be a book you love. Here's Amber talking a little big about where this book came from:</p>
<p>""So, one day, in 2011, I was at the grocery store waiting in line. The line was kind of long and I was pretty tired from an exerting session at the gym, and People Magazine was there, just staring at me. And I was staring back, looking at this cover full of women who I didn’t recognize. And I was just confused. Like, aren’t these magazines supposed to be covered with famous people so that you want to buy them and read all about the intimate and sordid details of their lives?</p>
<p>You see, I was relatively freshly out of grad school where I took classes, taught classes, worked a part time job, partied a little too much, and didn’t have a television. It was during this time that the movie Twilight came out. I was home for the holidays and told my mom “Hey, I hear there’s a new vampire movie out. Wanna go see it?” That was literally the only thing I knew about this phenomenon going in. It was a couple weeks before I learned of the chaos that surrounded it. </p>
<p>My life in Seattle my first year after grad school wasn’t much different from my time going to grad school in Boise, except replace partying too much with training for a 100 mile bike ride and volunteering and watching old movies with my gang of introverts.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the grocery store – there I was staring at these strangers and thinking about the weird nature of celebrity. At work the next day, I asked my coworkers for any old issues of People they might have lying around. The first that came to me? The Sexiest Man Alive 2011: Bradley Cooper. I didn’t know what I was doing, only that I wanted to think about this, this weird thing, this celebrity, this elective public eye, this performance of self. And so these poems were born.</p>
<p>Writing them was an exercise in patience. They are hard to write. Tons of research went in to each one, building a large corpus of pubic speech to work from. And then came the laborious process of picking at and shaping that public speech into something that ultimately represented each Sexist Man Alive’s performance of their own self as I experienced it. Writing them took a lot of mental and emotional energy, and a fair amount of coffee, beer and wine.</p>
<p>In the end, it was all worth it. I learned a lot about these strangers. I learned a lot about what it means to be a celebrity, and it isn’t all pretty. It’s not always a romping good time. But sometimes it is.</p>
<p>I also quickly learned who the women were on the cover of that fateful <i>People Magazine</i>. They were the Kardashians.""</p>

With this first specimen in 2015, William cultured it and shared it with everyone who showed interest. At the time this was only 30 people. Out of 30 people, only one person corresponded on growing the mushroom, Ryan Paul-Gates of Terrestrial Fungi. Ryan and William collaborated efforts in understanding techniques for the first grow.

<div>But are they really new?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cordyceps, more specifically Cordyceps militaris is a small orange club-shaped entomopathogenic fungus. Let's break this down. Entomo- of an insect; relating to insects Pathogen- an infectious agent. So basically, it's a fungus that infects insects. <strong>Don't worry! </strong>Corydceps will not infect humans, and, in fact, they are proving to be quite beneficial for human health!  Cordyceps have been revered in traditional Chinese medicine for a few thousand years. Cordyceps are now showing themselves to us in the English speaking world. Cordyceps are prized for their main active ingredient Cordycepin, which has been researched for its myriad potentials. <br/><br/>We are even starting to understand Cordyceps as a biological insecticide, or bio-control. Cordyceps often grow on species of insects that have the potential for overpopulation or decimation of important plants, and trees.</div>

<p><strong>COME ACQUISTARE</strong></p>
<p>Il calendario è acquistabile on-line su questa piattaforma; è una vera e propria prevendita che ti permetterà di comprare il prodotto oggi e di riceverlo comodamente a casa entro la fine del 2018 (ma puoi anche ritirarlo di persona se abiti vicino a noi). Esplora i vari pacchetti e scegli quello che fa per te!</p>
<p><strong>CHI SIAMO</strong></p>
<p>Siamo il Gruppo Veganzi della provincia di Venezia. Siamo attivisti per la diffusione della scelta vegan e il nostro gruppo esiste da dieci anni, per la precisione dal novembre 2008. Sul nostro territorio, in questi anni di attivismo, abbiamo organizzato quasi un centinaio di eventi fra conferenze, sit-in, proiezioni, partecipazioni radio, banchetti, corsi di cucina, rassegne cinematografiche, flash-mob, gare culinarie! Cerchiamo sempre di inventarci qualcosa di nuovo per raccogliere fondi da investire nell’organizzazione dei nostri eventi perché non sono mai a costo zero e richiedono l’investimento di un po’ di risorse economiche. Ecco perché abbiamo pensato di realizzare questo bellissimo calendario!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536438183/atpziu8ymde18xju9e77.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>DI COSA ABBIAMO BISOGNO?</strong></p>
<p>Il crowdfunding su questa piattaforma ci permetterà di stabilire quante copie del nostro calendario stampare (e quante spedirne o consegnarne a mano). Il tuo acquisto del nostro calendario tramite questo valido sistema è per noi il metodo più rapido e sicuro per centrare l’obiettivo!</p>
<p><strong>PERCHÉ SOSTENERE IL NOSTRO PROGETTO?</strong></p>
<p>Come gruppo informale di attivisti per la diffusione della cultura vegan cerchiamo di organizzare eventi per far conoscere il nostro stile di vita etico a più persone possibili sul nostro territorio. Questo richiede tempo, energie… e risorse economiche. Le vendite del nostro calendario sono per noi un modo per raccogliere i fondi necessari per organizzare al meglio i nostri eventi, perché questi richiedono l’acquisto di materiali, stampe, affitto delle location, etc.</p>
<p>Inoltre ogni anno sosteniamo adozioni a distanza di animali salvati da situazioni tragiche e cerchiamo di contribuire, nel nostro piccolo, alla sopravvivenza di rifugi che ospitano e si prendono cura di animali salvati da macelli e dallo sfruttamento (queste attività sono tutte documentate). Tutti i fondi che riusciamo a raccogliere vengono quindi reinvestiti per i nostri eventi o per dare sostegno a realtà animaliste che ne hanno urgente bisogno.</p>
<p><strong>IN QUALE ALTRO MODO POSSO CONTRIBUIRE?</strong></p>
<p>Il tuo contributo maggiore puoi darlo acquistando il nostro calendario da questa piattaforma! Ma puoi fare dell’altro… come diffondere la notizia di questo crowdfunding, spingendo parenti ed amici a sostenerlo a propria volta!</p>
<p><strong>QUANDO POTRÒ AVERE IL MIO CALENDARIO?</strong></p>
<p>Il calendario sarà pronto per la fine di novembre. Da quel momento noi potremo cominciare a spedirlo a tutti coloro che non risiedono nella nostra zona o che, pur essendoci vicini, preferiscono riceverlo comodamente a casa (spendendo però qualche euro in più per la spedizione). Consigliamo, quindi, a tutti coloro che ne hanno la possibilità di venire a ritirare il proprio calendario a Mestre, durante la nostra riunione mensile di dicembre 2018 (data ancora da stabilire ma che comunicheremo tempestivamente).<br/>Come ultima alternativa per chi risiede nella provincia di Venezia ma fosse impossibilitato a recarsi alla nostra riunione di dicembre 2018, proponiamo di ritirare di persona il proprio calendario presso una delle nostre abitazioni; essendo il nostro gruppo formato da una decina di persone, e abitando in zone diverse, può essere che ci si riesca a mettere d’accordo per questo tipo di consegna a mano.</p>

Il calendario è acquistabile on-line su questa piattaforma; è una vera e propria prevendita che ti permetterà di comprare il prodotto oggi e di riceverlo comodamente a casa entro la fine del 2018 (ma puoi anche ritirarlo di persona se abiti vicino a noi). Esplora i vari pacchetti e scegli quello che fa per te!
CHI SIAMO
Siamo il Gruppo Veganzi della provincia di Venezia. Siamo attivisti per la diffusione della scelta vegan e il nostro gruppo esiste da dieci anni, per la precisione dal novembre 2008. Sul nostro territorio, in questi anni di attivismo, abbiamo organizzato quasi un centinaio di eventi fra conferenze, sit-in, proiezioni, partecipazioni radio, banchetti, corsi di cucina, rassegne cinematografiche, flash-mob, gare culinarie! Cerchiamo sempre di inventarci qualcosa di nuovo per raccogliere fondi da investire nell’organizzazione dei nostri eventi perché non sono mai a costo zero e richiedono l’investimento di un po’ di risorse economiche. Ecco perché abbiamo pensato di realizzare questo bellissimo calendario!

 
DI COSA ABBIAMO BISOGNO?
Il crowdfunding su questa piattaforma ci permetterà di stabilire quante copie del nostro calendario stampare (e quante spedirne o consegnarne a mano). Il tuo acquisto del nostro calendario tramite questo valido sistema è per noi il metodo più rapido e sicuro per centrare l’obiettivo!
PERCHÉ SOSTENERE IL NOSTRO PROGETTO?
Come gruppo informale di attivisti per la diffusione della cultura vegan cerchiamo di organizzare eventi per far conoscere il nostro stile di vita etico a più persone possibili sul nostro territorio. Questo richiede tempo, energie… e risorse economiche. Le vendite del nostro calendario sono per noi un modo per raccogliere i fondi necessari per organizzare al meglio i nostri eventi, perché questi richiedono l’acquisto di materiali, stampe, affitto delle location, etc.
Inoltre ogni anno sosteniamo adozioni a distanza di animali salvati da situazioni tragiche e cerchiamo di contribuire, nel nostro piccolo, alla sopravvivenza di rifugi che ospitano e si prendono cura di animali salvati da macelli e dallo sfruttamento (queste attività sono tutte documentate). Tutti i fondi che riusciamo a raccogliere vengono quindi reinvestiti per i nostri eventi o per dare sostegno a realtà animaliste che ne hanno urgente bisogno.
IN QUALE ALTRO MODO POSSO CONTRIBUIRE?
Il tuo contributo maggiore puoi darlo acquistando il nostro calendario da questa piattaforma! Ma puoi fare dell’altro… come diffondere la notizia di questo crowdfunding, spingendo parenti ed amici a sostenerlo a propria volta!
QUANDO POTRÒ AVERE IL MIO CALENDARIO?
Il calendario sarà pronto per la fine di novembre. Da quel momento noi potremo cominciare a spedirlo a tutti coloro che non risiedono nella nostra zona o che, pur essendoci vicini, preferiscono riceverlo comodamente a casa (spendendo però qualche euro in più per la spedizione). Consigliamo, quindi, a tutti coloro che ne hanno la possibilità di venire a ritirare il proprio calendario a Mestre, durante la nostra riunione mensile di dicembre 2018 (data ancora da stabilire ma che comunicheremo tempestivamente).Come ultima alternativa per chi risiede nella provincia di Venezia ma fosse impossibilitato a recarsi alla nostra riunione di dicembre 2018, proponiamo di ritirare di persona il proprio calendario presso una delle nostre abitazioni; essendo il nostro gruppo formato da una decina di persone, e abitando in zone diverse, può essere che ci si riesca a mettere d’accordo per questo tipo di consegna a mano.",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm Sam Qualiana, a screenwriter of independent films who has worked in numerous capacities on over 30 feature films in my career. My vocation has always been storytelling - This is the first manuscript I have written for a novel and now I want to share it with you.<br/> </p>
<p>I came up with the concept for Journey of the Avenger in 1998, when I was 12 years old. I created a series of stories and drew artwork of every character and creature in their world. As I got older I decided I wanted to expand the stories and write the first one into a screenplay. Once I completed the script I'd decided I needed more, so I wrote the first story into a manuscript for a 62,000 + word novel. I've created an entire universe over the past 20 years that revolves around these stories. I made star charts that show the other planets in their universe, I've been working on a visual dictionary that shows artwork of what the aliens look like and explains in detail everything about each creature, ship, person, planet and so on; Basically everything that happens within these stories is explained or summarized in there.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm hoping that with your help, I can get a jump on releasing this first story to the world. In the future I plan to create all of the stories within this series into more novels. By contributing to this campaign you'll help me turn my words into a physical book that I can distribute and share with you. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>I'm looking to initially raise $500.00 for the campaign.</p>
<p>All of that money will go towards paying an artist to come up with an incredible cover for the book as well as ordering a minimum of 50 hard copies of the novel. </p>
<p>If we raise more than that, I will order more copies of the book that I will be able to sell to the public.</p>
<p>I have worked out a game plan for how to get these books printed and have a couple of different options that I will mill through depending on how much I end up raising in the end. I know how much it's going to cost and the more we make the better it's going to be.</p>
<p>If we don't reach the goal, all that will do is slow us down. I will still work on raising the money myself to get what I need, but it will take much more time to complete. </p>
<p>The good news is that anyone who wanted to read the book will still get a digital PDF copy at the end of the campaign, regardless if we reach the goal or not. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Journey of the Avenger follows the story of Charles Bligh on his first voyage into space as the Captain of the star ship Avenger.</p>
<p>The novel is a story of self-discovery, consequences, dealing with the reality of death and the human condition; All within a space western.</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>Earth Year 2116, the scout ship Grasshopper crashes on an uncharted planet in the Thadious System. In their final transmission the crew reported the sighting of a lost starship, the Abigal Rose. </p>

<p>This mission is personal for the newly instated Captain, as his brother Daniel was one of the crew members aboard the Abigal Rose when it disappeared into space three years ago.<br/>Charles and his crew travel to the foreign planet Oblivia and reunite with survivors of the Abigal Rose's crew. Upon their encounter however, they discover that the amphibian and fish-like humanoids that have protected these men and women over the years are at war with a relentless adversary.</p>
<p>Charles must decide either to put more lives in danger to help the natives of this foreign world or to abandon them and any hope they may have for survival. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know that not everybody has a few extra bucks to spare. I wish I could donate to every friend's campaign that pops up, but in reality we can't always do that, so if you aren't able to donate even the smallest amount, I get it. </p>
<p>Maybe you just don't like reading science fiction, that's fine too. It's not everybody's cup of tea. You're not hurting anyone's feelings having your own taste. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Work. Money. Family. Friends. Purpose. Love. Service. Country. Faith. Health. Community.</p>
<p>The list is never ending. The priorities are always shifting. The grind never stops.</p>
<p>Our names are Dr. Brian Peterson and Ivy Sole, alums of the University of Pennsylvania and multidisciplinary learners, creators, and thinkers. When we were in the midst of our Jordan years (45 and 23, respectively), pursuing education, writing books, making music, and holding full time jobs in higher education, we happened upon a book called Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less. The core tenet being, by doing less, we can do more of what’s important and do it better. But what happens when it’s all important? What do you do when, by virtue of your identity, you cannot do less? When you’re a crucial piece of too many puzzles to count, what do you cut?</p>
<p>The Good Grind is our attempt to make sense of a world that demands more of us than we think we have to give. We want to expand the notion of Essentialism to account for all the things that become essential when your life is at the intersection of racial, gender, sexual, political, socioeconomic, ethnic, and faith identities. We want to help folks do more and do it better, while embracing their unique brilliance, and savoring the moments.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The first order of business for The Good Grind team is getting as many books in your hands as humanly possible. We've got the Ebook covered, but we need help getting the paperbacks printed and covering costs for expansion into podcasting, workshops, scholarships, and more! </p>
<p>$5000 provides:</p>
<p>- The first run of 500 print copies of The Good Grind</p>
<p>- Season 1 of The Good Grind Project podcast (10 episodes!)</p>
<p>- Book launch events in Philly, NYC, and DC in 2019</p>
<p>As soon as you hit the third tier of giving ($50), you're automatically entered into a raffle to send The Good Grind to a group of students of your choice! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We embarked upon this project quite literally to change lives. The Good Grind is a quick but transformative read. We hope that the book, podcast, and future workshops create opportunities for growth, conversation, and collaboration. We want to help you shape the best version of yourself, and we want to get The Good Grind story to as many people as possible.</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div><p>If you can't be a fan and cop an Ebook, we'd love for you to put others onto The Good Grind by spreading the word.

<p>How far would you go to avenge the one you love? Would you go beyond death? Born into the stifling confines of French upper society, Babette Varanus never thought that she would have to answer that question. Surrounded by wealth yet ostracized by her peers, Babette had little interest in love until she met Korbinian, a scandalous German baron with the audacity to regard her as his equal. But when the intrigues of her grandfather's enemies conspire to tear them apart, Varanus will embark upon a journey of vengeance, love, and redemption that will take her beyond the limitations of mortality and reveal to her the dark forces that command humanity from the shadows. Faced with madness, murder, hidden cults, and erudite vampires, does she have the strength to withstand the storm that rises against her?<br/><br/><br/>The Ouroboros Cycle: A Monster's Coming Of Age Story is a tale of adventure, romance, and vampires. It is author G. D. Falksen's attempt to raise awareness about the illustrated novel. If it does well, we hope it will encourage more publishers to release illustrated books, reviving an art form that is now severely on the decline.<br/><br/>But we cannot do this alone. Like many books, the novel has a limited marketing budget, which makes it difficult for us to boost the signal and raise awareness. That is where you come in. We're asking for your help in raising money for a full-scale marketing campaign.<br/><br/>The Ouroboros Cycle is the culmination of ten years of work, an attempt to tell an epic decades-spanning story through a beautiful but dying medium. If The Ouroboros Cycle proves successful enough it will show publishers that illustrated novels really are worth the extra work and the cost of the art. That means more novels with art and illustrations, more work for artists, and more art. And more art is always a good thing.<br/><br/></p>

<p>Money raised by this campaign will go to pay for ads, social media management, promotional assistance, and other methods of boosting the signal. We intend to produce at least one book trailer (more depending on the funds raised), posters, promotional merchandise, etc.<br/><br/>In addition, if this campaign surpasses its goal, some of the money will go to cover the cost of illustrating the remaining books in the series. While the entire series is scheduled for publication, illustrations will only be included if sufficient funds can be raised for them.</p>

Would you go beyond death? Born into the stifling confines of French upper society, Babette Varanus never thought that she would have to answer that question. Surrounded by wealth yet ostracized by her peers, Babette had little interest in love until she met Korbinian, a scandalous German baron with the audacity to regard her as his equal. But when the intrigues of her grandfather's enemies conspire to tear them apart, Varanus will embark upon a journey of vengeance, love, and redemption that will take her beyond the limitations of mortality and reveal to her the dark forces that command humanity from the shadows. Faced with madness, murder, hidden cults, and erudite vampires, does she have the strength to withstand the storm that rises against her?The Ouroboros Cycle: A Monster's Coming Of Age Story is a tale of adventure, romance, and vampires. It is author G. D. Falksen's attempt to raise awareness about the illustrated novel. If it does well, we hope it will encourage more publishers to release illustrated books, reviving an art form that is now severely on the decline.But we cannot do this alone. Like many books, the novel has a limited marketing budget, which makes it difficult for us to boost the signal and raise awareness. That is where you come in. We're asking for your help in raising money for a full-scale marketing campaign.The Ouroboros Cycle is the culmination of ten years of work, an attempt to tell an epic decades-spanning story through a beautiful but dying medium. If The Ouroboros Cycle proves successful enough it will show publishers that illustrated novels really are worth the extra work and the cost of the art. That means more novels with art and illustrations, more work for artists, and more art. And more art is always a good thing.

Money raised by this campaign will go to pay for ads, social media management, promotional assistance, and other methods of boosting the signal. We intend to produce at least one book trailer (more depending on the funds raised), posters, promotional merchandise, etc.In addition, if this campaign surpasses its goal, some of the money will go to cover the cost of illustrating the remaining books in the series. While the entire series is scheduled for publication, illustrations will only be included if sufficient funds can be raised for them.

Any and all support is welcome, and all of our rewards are drawn from or inspired by the novel. We have prints of the novel's art, signed copies of the book, the novel's soundtrack, custom made accessories, and much, much more.In addition to the listed rewards, we have tons of stretch rewards in store. Whenever this campaign reaches a goal a new stretch goal amount will be revealed along with the stretch rewards that accompany it.

<p>~ Dear Friends,</p>
<p>After watching my video campaign, you will get an inside look at my children's book ""The Paci Fairy"", the fun easy solution to getting rid of the Paci.  The video offers insight on how my method was born and why it works.  You will have a better understanding of what I am pursuing with my children's book series ""The Paci Fairy"".  I share personal footage of my daughter and myself during that very scary and exciting time when The Paci Fairy came to visit!</p>
<p>The book has done very well and is actually considered number one in its genre on Amazon.  It is now time to expand our horizons and broaden our audience. </p>
<p>This is why I am seeking $1,500.  I would like to shoot a larger format video that will reach the masses.  Of course, my goal would be to have it go viral, but there is no certainty that this will happen.  But with my filmakers in place, a little magic and my ideas already storyboarded... I know we can get this video out there from the web to Utube to even television!  I can reach all those parents and guardians that may be dealing with the same frustrating issue......how do I get rid of that beloved Pacifier!!!  The entire $1,500 will be used for three days of shooting, casting, props, crafts services and any extra cost that may be incurred.</p>
<p>The opening of my campaign video exposes a sneak peak to the larger format video that will be shot at the end of this year in which specific illustrations from the book will be brought to life.  For example, the wedding couple getting married with pacifiers in their mouths' illustration will be shot with real people (similar to the beginning of this video). </p>
<p>   <strong>~ Please come be a part of the video...and please be a part of my dream! ~ </strong></p>

<h2>What we do</h2>
<p>We at <em>Minds of Peace</em> organize Israeli-Palestinian public congresses for peace negotiations.  We bring ordinary Israelis and ordinary Palestinians to discuss, debate and negotiate solutions to the conflict under the guidance of two moderators and according to a set of ground rules.  Our ultimate goal is to create popular support and activism among Israelis and Palestinians for the establishment of an Israeli-Palestinian public negotiating congress <em>with</em> <em>political power</em>. This will be the 16th such congress.   </p>
<h2><strong>Why We do it? </strong></h2>
<p>We believe involving the people directly in negotiations has been the missing element in all previous peace efforts.  The congress intends to involve the people in the peacemaking process, prepare them for a peaceful social order, and motivate the leadership to conclude agreements.</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Bringing Israelis and Palestinians to a negotiating table is extremely challenging, but that is what we do. It is also expensive, and that's where we need your help!  We need $2500 to cover expenses for the next congress.  Your contributions will pay for expenses, such as:</p>
<p>-          Getting permissions for Palestinians to enter Israel.</p>
<p>-          Renting Conference hall with equipment.</p>
<p>-         Paying for travel and accommodation for the Palestinian delegation.</p>
<p>-          Filming the event &amp; public relations</p>
<p>We will use the money we raise to organize a congress on July 13-14, 2012. You will become part of our people-to-people peace initiative and help us carry the initiative one step closer to the next step– building a momentum for the creation of a major Israeli-Palestinian public negotiating congress with political power!   </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>The <em>Minds of Peace</em> Organization has, so far, successfully led 15 small-scale Israeli-Palestinian public negotiating congresses around the US, Canada, in the West Bank and lately in Israel. The delegations included ordinary people from the entire political spectrum, including: Israeli settlers, Palestinians who had spent years in Israeli jails for resisting the occupation, Israeli supporters of right wing parties, students, business people, and people who lost loved ones in the conflict. In each case, the delegations succeeded in generating agreements. Moreover, each congress succeeded to create peace coalitions which are committed to promote the culture of peace. To view the agreements, visit our website: mindsofpeace.org</p>
<h2> The Concept</h2>
<p>6 ordinary Israelis meet 6 ordinary Palestinians in order to discuss, debate and negotiate solutions to their tragic struggle. They have 5 sessions, over one weekend, to reach a grassroots peace agreement. The dialogue is conducted in front of an audience, which is invited to participate in the peacemaking process.</p>

<h3>Dear Friends and Fans of Poetry,</h3>
<p>Since inception, <a href=""http://spookygirlfriendpress.com/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Spooky Girlfriend Press</strong></a> has published, almost exclusively, chapbooks by women. Women from a variety of stations in life whose poetics and work are more varied than the typical Norton anthology would suggest. We believe that women continue to be underrepresented in the world of poetry and our primary goal is to fight against this condition and attempt, in our own way, to make a dent in this situation. We have learned a lot along the way from friends and our publishing operation has improved little by little over time up to the current day. Today, we are ready to publish our first book!</p>
<h3>But we need your help.</h3>
<p>For our tiny two-person operation, publishing a book is a very different animal from a chapbook and we want to be sure to do the book justice. The book we want to publish is by <a href=""http://www.nicolesteinberg.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Nicole Steinberg</strong></a>, a poet we’ve been excited about and loved for years. The book, <em>Getting Lucky</em>, is a collection of sonnets culled from the editorial copy of <em>Lucky</em>, a newsstand publication about shopping and style. By adopting the magazine's gendered and glossy language, Nicole's poems explore contemporary ideals of beauty and femininity, as well as female-specific narratives we see in media, culture, and everyday life. We are hoping to reach a goal of $1,500, all of which will be used for design, production, and marketing, and poured into this book that we love and think you will love, too. Plus, the more we raise, the more we can do! Nicole is in the early stages of planning readings this fall to spread <em>Getting Lucky</em> far and wide, and additional support will help make to make this happen!</p>

<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Stretch Goal</strong></h3>
<p>As of July 17, we officially met our initial goal of $1,500, and we can guarantee that <em>Getting Lucky</em> will be published, along with a fantastic cover design by artist <a href=""http://carriegabella.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carrie Gabella</a>.

<p>Our first stretch goal is $2,500. Your contributions will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced interior design of <em>Getting Lucky</em>
</li>
<li>The cost of printing additional books</li>
<li>A larger marketing campaign, so these poems can reach a wider audience</li>

Dear Friends and Fans of Poetry,
Since inception, Spooky Girlfriend Press has published, almost exclusively, chapbooks by women. Women from a variety of stations in life whose poetics and work are more varied than the typical Norton anthology would suggest. We believe that women continue to be underrepresented in the world of poetry and our primary goal is to fight against this condition and attempt, in our own way, to make a dent in this situation. We have learned a lot along the way from friends and our publishing operation has improved little by little over time up to the current day. Today, we are ready to publish our first book!
But we need your help.
For our tiny two-person operation, publishing a book is a very different animal from a chapbook and we want to be sure to do the book justice. The book we want to publish is by Nicole Steinberg, a poet we’ve been excited about and loved for years.

By adopting the magazine's gendered and glossy language, Nicole's poems explore contemporary ideals of beauty and femininity, as well as female-specific narratives we see in media, culture, and everyday life.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Jordan Sternberg and I am going to be a senior at the Idyllwild Arts Academy* this coming fall. I am in the newly founded InterArts* department where I will be creating our schools first ever Arts Magazine.</p>
<p>I chose the name Asylum because of it's double meaning. The school is an... interesting place that can sometimes make me feel like I'm going crazy. However, this magazine has become a sanctuary for me to express thoughts and ideas. </p>
<p>This magazine is going to be placed all over our small town of 3500* for students, faculty and residents to see Art from the perspective of people like me, people who have been traditionally put on the back burner. Al<span>though my school supports this idea, they can only help me artistically, not financially.</span></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>And for that reason I am here, on Indiegogo to fund my project. Printing magazines in small quantities isn't cheap and I need all the help I can get.</p>
<p>This project will cost approximately $12000 to complete. Of course I am not going to burden you with that hefty pricetag so I'm only here to ask for the money to print the magazine. The printing company requires a minimum of 1000 copies so here is the breakdown for that.</p>
<p>Printing cost break down (Approximately):</p>
<img alt=""Price Breakdown"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i782.photobucket.com/albums/yy103/JSterny/ScreenShot2012-06-15at35300AM-1.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Price Breakdown""/>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In case you decide to be a part of a miracle here are some other magazine costs(Not as detailed as the printing):</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>$3000 for supplies. This includes fabric for fashion, paint supplies for the visual artists, costumes for dancers and the computer software to put the whole thing together</li>
<li>$500 for gas. My school is about 6,000 feet up and it is a 45 minutes drive down the mountain, in a van... not cheap :)</li>
<li>$1000 for security. In case something goes wrong with supplies or slight price calculations are off for print we want to make sure there is a little extra for protection.</li>
</ul>
<div>To show my appriciation for your participation we really have some great perks on the side you should look at. Any amount helps!</div>
<div>Also, in case we aren't able to reach our goal, we have negotiated several things that could cut printing prices- cutting pages, shrinking the size of the magazine, using no recycled paper and removing several trips from the itinerary. </div>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is so much more than a magazine. This is collaboration. We have students from 12 countries, 4 grades and 5 artistic disiplines on board for this. We have teachers that have taught graphic design, worked as a fashion designers assistant in New York, or give seminars in Los Angeles about what it means to be an artist.</p>
<p>This is more than a one trick pony. This will be sent to competitions all around the world. It's a safety zone for people who want to express their thought without fear of judgement. It has articles in English as well as Korean, Mandarin and Spanish. This is something amazing. It just happens to be a magazine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you can't contribute that is totally fine. There are other ways to help. Spread the word. Tell friends and family about this truly revolutionary idea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is something incredible. It's an Asylum... no, it IS Asylum</p>

My Story
 
My name is Madeleine (MADlines) Clifford and I am
a lyricist, educator and page poet originally from Seattle,
WA.  You might know me as one half of the female hip hop duo, CANARYSING
(http://canarysing.tumblr.com/). 
   
I’m excited to announce that I was recently accepted into
the VONA/Voices workshop—a  week-long workshop for writers of
color from around the globe. (http://voicesatvona.org/Index.html)
 
I have been accepted to work with poet Willie Perdomo. Willie
Perdomo has won the Pen American Center Beyond Margins award and has been the
recipient of numerous fellowships. I am confident that he will successfully
mentor me in fine-tuning my MFA thesis project, which consists of a collection
of narrative poetry and prose.
 
But…I NEED YOUR SUPPORT!  Please help me attend VONA/Voices
this summer and support myself as an artist.
 
The Impact
 
VONA/Voices is the only multi-genre workshop for writers of color
and is an amazing opportunity to examine not just multi-genre writing, but also
multiracial perspectives  through a
creative lens. 
 
As a multiracial person myself, I have continuously
wondered: how might my multiethnic upbringing inform my work?  How can I write into
multiculturalism?  Does my Patwa-infused, Caribbean ancestry inform how I
craft language in my poems?  
 
Taking part in a VONA/Voices workshop will allow me to analyze
these inquires further and contribute to a literary body of work that can give
voice to a generation of mixed Americans.
 
What I Need & What You Get
 
To attend
VONA/Voices, I need $1,800 for workshop costs and related expenditures. VONA
takes place from June 19th - June 25th at UC
Berkeley.  Every bit counts.  If you can only support a $1 that helps too.
 
Supporters of
WRITE ON! will recieve the satisfaction of helping a young writer build her
body of work! 
 
BUT WAIT!
There's more...

<h1><strong>About Eau de Vie:</strong></h1>
<p>Eau de Vie launched in February 2010 to great acclaim, and has in its short three years collected a swag of awards for its high standard of service and great quality drinks and experiences - so not only are we super nerdy about cocktails, but we have a pretty sweet trophy shelf too. Eau de Vie has since been launched in Melbourne and just recently celebrated its first birthday. </p>
<p>Eau de Vie is all about pushing the boundaries when it comes to drinks creation, customer service and theatre. Our bartenders are amongst the best in the country (we'd like to think maybe the universe as well), and include the current Australian Bartender of the Year, Greg Sanderson (heading up the Melbourne operations), and the 2007 Bartender of the Year, Charles Ainsbury(heading up the Sydney operations) as well as a crew of raffish rogues, with many a cocktail competition to their name.</p>
<p><em>Awards include: Gourmet Traveller Bar of the Year 2011, Australian Cocktail Bar of the Year 2012 &amp; 2011 (Australian Bar Awards) World’s Best New Cocktail Bar 2011 Tales of the Cocktail New Orleans, Time Out Bar of the Year 2011, Time Out Cocktail Bar of the Year 2010, Time Out Best New Bar 2010</em></p>
<h1><strong>Why this Cocktail Book?</strong></h1>
<p>There are a lot of cocktail books out there, but a lot of the time they are simply re-hashing the same old drinks. We hope that the Eau de Vie cocktail book will be something very different, and it is possible that this will become the single most important book to mark our age (we can have high hopes . . .)</p>
<p><em>We are aiming for 200 pages of inspirational drinks art</em></p>
<p>Beautiful drinks photography, inspirational at home recipes as well as the secrets behind our signature cocktails will hopefully make this interesting reading for both bartenders and cocktail fans. We'll also be including information on the venues themselves, some of our staff, both past and present &amp; the drinks they are known for and love to make...</p>
<p><strong>Our goal: </strong></p>
<p>To inspire people to make more cocktails at home – to entertain friends with great drinks and have more fun!</p>
<h1>Your Donation:</h1>
<p>We really want to make this as beautiful a book as we can. The money raised will go towards paying for photography &amp; design, as well of course printing. In addition of course there are the Shipping fees &amp; Indiegogo's share ;-)</p>
<p>Without you and your support - this book may remain a pipe-dream. With your help, we can help spread our passion for great drinks!</p>
<p>Your donation, depening on level, will get you anything from an amazing and (we hope) inspirational cocktail book, to a private party at our venue &amp; books all around for you and your friends.</p>
<p>Get involved!</p>
<p>BOOOM!</p>

By preserving photographs from locals, the project aims to tell the stories of everyday people from the past, people that are not mentioned in history books.So far we’ve collected and scanned over 1,500 photos. We have also worked to capture the stories behind them. These unseen photos which Vintage Addis Ababa has curated bring to light a rich and varied perspective of history. After reaching hundreds of thousands of people online through social media we’re now turning the project into a photo book.  We believe a high-quality photography book is a good way to do justice to the photos and stories behind them. We are working on a high-end product while maintaining the overall personal and intimate look. The book will feature the photos with their rough edges, entire text written by a typewriter and bi-lingual Amharic/English quotes so as to not loose the authenticity.Grants we’ve received in Ethiopia from the Embassy of Switzerland, the European Union in Ethiopia and Alliance EthioFrançais have helped us expand the project. Our recently completed crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter helped us to raise enough funds to produce the book.We now offer the book and other rewards on Indiegogo too.With your support we might be able to expand the book a little bit and add more pages. With your help the photographs and stories can be passed from the hands of their owners in Ethiopia to the hands of an international audience. Imagine; these stories which show the celebration of everyday life, despite the hardships of the time, will be heard across the world!Book specifications225 pages, full color on premium uncoated paperSewn-bound in a hard-cover with textile coverPrinted in Germany Size cm: 17x23 (closed) / 34x23 (open) Size inch: 6.7x9 (closed) / 13.4x9 (open) Bekele Nega in 1956 (boy on the left) when he went to the Akaki Adventist boarding school and in 1973 when he applied to get a seat in the last general election of emperor Haile Selassie.​Genet (second from the right) during a celebration in the 60’s, graduating in the 80’s, and working at Ghion Hotel in the 80’s.Vintage Addis Ababa in the news“Love can often flourish in the most hopeless of situations.” BBC“ቪንቴጅ - አዲስ"" -የአዲስ አበባ ትዝታ ፡- ዕድሜቸው 30 እና ከዚያ በላይ ያስቆጠሩ፣ በአብዛኛው በጥቁርና ነጭ ቀለም የተነሱ፣ ትናንትን ነጋሪ ፎቶዎች የተከዘኑበት ድረ-ገጽ ነው፡፡” BBC“A recent photography project celebrates a counterintuitive truth about human life: that what is most personal tells us about what is most universal.” Selamta“Vintage Addis Ababa aims to show that people still had lives to live in spite of the monumental incidents happening in the country."" QuartzInterview with Wongel on Arte (French and German) The teamThe team behind Vintage Addis Ababa are Wongel Abebe, Philipp Schütz and Nafkot Gebeyehu. Wongel graduated from the Addis Ababa University School of Journalism and Communications in 2016.

<h3>A Brief Description About Myself</h3>
<p>Hello all!!!</p>

I'm known to most as Toya J. I'm many things (activist, modern day mystic, accessories designer, and a few more)  but for the purposes of this project I am a poet.  I'm a California native currently residing in Las Vegas. After a degree, several ""respectable"" jobs, and a few years in non-profit work I've decided to go the route of the self-employed. Which is hippie talk for wayward artist. So I'm presently knee deep in the Las Vegas art scene pursuing my creative endeavors and focusing on all the things I've always wanted to put together such as poetry workshops, open mics, events, and my poetry book.</p>

<h3>That Which Does Not Burn</h3>
<p><span>Two years ago a friend of mine read some of my poetry and suggested that I publish a book. Before then it had never occurred to me to do this so I initially shrugged off the idea. But she planted a seed and since then I've had several others ask me if I'm going to publish my poetry. I took this as a sign.</span></p>
<p><span>I gathered all my poems, dated as far back as 2004, and compiled them into one collection. This is how That Which Does Not Burn came to be. I titled my book after the African adinkra symbol for imperishability and endurance, Hye Won Hye. Hye Won Hye literally translates into ""that which does not burn"". African priests used to wear the symbol because they would conduct rituals involving fire and not get burned. I noticed that all of the poems in the collection tell a story--my journey. And my journey hasn't been easy. I've been through a lot and yet I've taken every experience as a lesson, never allowing anything to break or burn me. </span></p>
<p><span>I feel like its important for everyone to have a platform where they can share their experiences with others.<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span>I wrote my first poem at the age of 12, and from then on the creative expression has always served as an outlet. Being able to tell your story and connect with others is one of the most powerful <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://heartsmirage.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/78198_290747134359435_1817789260_o.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>forms of healing there is.

</div>
<div>
<h3>The What, Where, &amp; Why</h3>
<p>That Which Does Not Burn will be my very first book of poetry. Never in a million years did I ever think I would publish anything. Therefore this project is extremely special to me. That Which Does Not Burn will be a self published work. I've decided to go that route for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self publishing allows me to retain all rights and creative control over my art</li>
<li>It's cheaper. Cutting the cost of production which allows me to sell my book on a ""donation"" bases, rather than at a set (and inflated) price. </li>
<li>Copies will be printed at a Vegas based printing company in order to support local business. </li>
</ul>
<p>The amount needed for this project is $750, which would be considered a very reasonable sum in terms of book publishing. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>100 book bound copies</li>
<li>ISBN #</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else such as manuscript editing, book cover design, marketing, e-book, copyright, etc has already been handled either out of my own pocket or through a network of people willing to donate their services in order to see my project come together. I've already got the ball rolling; now I need this last piece in order to complete it. Even if I don't raise the entire $730, any amount I do receive will go towards printing as many books as I can. Any funds raised above my goal will be put into my next project, a recorded poetry album. </p>
<h3>Donations &amp; Perks</h3>
<p><span>Eternal gratitude and humble appreciation will always be expressed for any support I receive for this project. Whether it be through monetary means or simply sharing this campaign with others.</span></p>
<p><span>My tangible ""Thank You"" includes signed copies of my book, gift certificates from my online jewelry store,  a special mention in my poetry book, and much more!!!!</span></p>

<p><i><strong><u>**Final Update**</u></strong></i></p>
<p><i>It is with gratitude, excitement, and a feeling of accomplishment that I’m happy to announce that my campaign goal has now been fully funded due to a tiny bit of outside funding! I would like to thank my friends, family, publisher, and even some strangers for coming together to support me on this endeavor. We couldn’t have done this without you!</i></p>
<h3><strong><u>Story of My Book</u></strong></h3>
<p>The Adversity Seekers — As a larger society, we are often told difficult and adverse circumstances are negatives and only negatives. And while this can certainly be true, it also need not be. In my book, I will illustrate through personal experiences, those of high achievers, and thoughts from psychologists that stress and adversity can be harnessed to our benefit in our journey to recognize our best selves. <br/><br/>My name is Chris O’Reilly and I am the author of The Adversity Seekers. I wrote this book because I want to proliferate the otherwise unseen message of actively seeking difficult challenges and the adversity that naturally follows in order to fuel personal growth. And through my own often unglamorous story, I want to impart that if I can transform and turn around my life, you can, too.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover just how capable and resilient we as humans are, and how struggle and stress from that struggle can be harnessed to do good. Through my book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for finding your best self through adversity in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you move forward with tools and practical knowledge on just how to begin the long, rewarding process of growing mentally tougher through not shying away from the inevitable stresses of life. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about suffering and how you begin growth to maximizing your life through its difficulty. </p>
<p>You will learn a history of how past cultures have viewed suffering as a positive tool. The Spartans were particularly regimented in this regard, and you will find a new appreciation for the warriors (of civilian and military profession) in our present culture.</p>
<p>I share the story of my life - going from born 10 pounds, 11 ounces and thought to be twins until the day of my birth to a competitive athlete now at age 28. In that span of time, I gained 100 pounds twice, lost 100 pounds twice, battled mental illness, earned a college degree, survived decades of bullying, and learned a lifetime’s worth of lessons.</p>
<p>Who is your favorite fictional character? I tell you my own, and why I believe we treasure these beings from stories so much, especially during times of adversity and struggle.</p>
<p>You will love and enjoy this book if you want to turn your life around and are looking for ways to do that. I also know that this book is for you if you are ready to acknowledge who you truly are, warts and all, in order to get started on your journey to becoming whole. Realizing your potential is what I hope to help with, and I believe that you will get much from my book to start doing so. <br/><br/>The Adversity Seekers is a non-fiction book that I believe could feasibly speak to anybody of any age, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, etc. If you want to grow, and you feel stuck in a rut right now, you can benefit from reading my book - my message does not discriminate. However, specifically, I know I could have used this message of adversity seeking as a young college student, and have spoken to many middle aged adults who are looking at struggle and how to grow through it for the first time.</p>
<h3><strong><u>The Book - The Adversity Seekers</u></strong></h3>My book is written as one cohesive arc. As I share my life journey, I give challenges to each reader. And, in between each vignette from my life, I share thoroughly researched pieces on various aspects of what it means to be an adversity seeker. <br/><br/>I explore the phenomenon of delayed gratification, as well as the benefits of fictional characters and stories on our lives and the history of suffering. <br/><br/>Overall, I share a cohesive blend of different tips to find the positives in struggling and personal and outside stories meant to illustrate these points. <br/> <h3><strong><u>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</u></strong></h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<p>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December 2020.</p>
<p>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</p>
<p>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</p>

When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.<br/><br/><i><strong>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</strong></i><p>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish!</p>
<p>A personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book.</p>

<h3><strong><u>About the Author</u></strong></h3>
<p>Chris O’Reilly is a writer and speaker who has lost 100 pounds twice in his life. Last year, he finished in the top 16% of worldwide finishers (more than 1,500) for the annual CrossFit Murph Challenge (a mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 squats, and another mile run). He has performed at The Second City and iO in Chicago, Illinois, and is making his debut as an author with this book. Currently, he is in the midst of founding his life and business coaching company.<br/><br/>O’Reilly is passionate about the power of the human mind over the human body, especially during times of extreme stress and duress. As somebody who has struggled with depression and anxiety his entire life, he has always sought the reason behind why human beings are meant to struggle and grind so hard. He came to the conclusion that humans are meant to in order to be pushed to discovering the best in themselves. He wanted to write this book and share his message and story to make an impact, however small or large, on those wanting to come to that conclusion themselves. <br/><br/>Growing up a larger kid in an Irish/Italian family, however, O’Reilly understands the struggle: Pizza is awesome. So is spaghetti. So is Irish soda bread. So are Ho-Ho’s, and Twinkies, and Oatmeal Cream Pies. So fret not! Having treat nights is still part of the message!<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Chris O’Reilly at christopher.oreilly7591@gmail.com, and on LinkedIn at LinkedIn.com/chris0reilly.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

La aparente inverosimilitud de ese calor sirve al autor para metaforizar una realidad social enferma e ir más allá de las antedichas consecuencias. El protagonista de la historia, Gregorio Almeida, es un hombre que vive (sobrevive) solo en una pequeña ciudad de provincias y que se alimenta de la amistad con una anciana vecina y del recuerdo de una reciente historia de amor con una muchacha, cuyo erotismo (casi suicida) devora al protagonista. Poco a poco la vida (y la soledad, y la indefensión) se deteriora y se va desvaneciendo. Los habitantes de la ciudad parecen haber enloquecido e insisten en vivir el infierno como un dechado de felicidad. El perpetuo sol y las temperaturas son sinónimo del mismo pensamiento común y obligatorio. Plagas de cucarachas convierten en probabilidad lo que parece imposible. Y, sin embargo, el amor, la lucidez, la amistad y la ternura sostienen, casi en vilo, a Gregorio Almeida hasta darle valor, finalmente, para enfrentarse al rostro de ese calor que supera cualquier dimensión conocida.</p><h3>¿Quiénes?</h3><p><strong>Tandaia </strong>es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de publicar obras poco convencionales pero de indudable calidad, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para promocionar cada título cuando esta todavía se encuentra en proceso de edición.</p><p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p><p>Hoy te presentamos a <strong>Antonio Gallo</strong>.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">El autor de <i>El calor y la noche</i> nace y vive en Córdoba hasta los treinta y pico años de edad.

Cosas que pasan, qué le vamos a hacer. Dicho autor ha publicado algunas novelas y libros de poesía. Aunque eso carece de importancia. Lo único que importa es la gratitud hacia los antepasados que avalan sus recuerdos, sus lecturas y su vida.

Es una angustia que va creciendo dentro de mí poco a poco, hasta hacerse realidad: estoy convencida de que no vas a volver, de que no me vas a quitar las correas. Y saber eso es lo peor.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

<p><strong>♥</strong><strong> Yippie, hooray we made it. We're beaming and crying all at the same time. Your belief means the world to us and we are eternally grateful. </strong><strong>♥</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><strong>We're starting work on the FRENCH &amp; INUKTITUT <span>ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ</span> translation of <em>Our Canadian Love Story</em>. </strong></strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Our little love tale has made it to indiegogo's homepage and took their twitter campaign of the day. Air Canada featured us in a fantastic interview and we're mighty proud of how much love and support you've shown us. It's been a remarkable ride as well as a full time job. </strong></p>
<p><strong>You have made our publishing dream come true. Thanks to all of your donations <em>Our Canadian Love Story</em> will soon be printed and now el señor Giacomo and mademoiselle Jacqueline officially get to fall in love. </strong></p>
<p><strong>It only took 160 of you to make Rebecca and I dance across the rainbow...<strong>and then the contributions just kept coming. </strong>Remarkable. We're humbled and speechless.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Linnie's love letter to funders and to Canada:<br/></strong></p>
<p>♥ on march 7th you made our dream come true. rebecca and i are dancing across the rainbow and you’re the ones holding our hands. this dream has been about so much more than just publishing ‘our canadian love story’.</p>
<p>this book is linnie’s ‘thank you’ note to the many canadians that have left their homes and families, waved their loved ones good bye in the place they’ve known and adored, in the hope of turning a page and starting their own 'canadian love story'.</p>
<p>i cannot wait to talk to children and parents all over canada about the hardship they’ve endured to make a new life in a foreign place…a place we all want to call home…a place we take pride in…a place we finally hope to belong to…and a place we know we can give our all to. we’re not here because our homes aren’t livable, but because we come with the united hope of contributing in a place that will appreciate our efforts.</p>
<p>the reasons we come here are as diverse as the colours of the beaches around the world…our stories are our own…our pains are shared…and the hopes that unite us dance along the same spectrum of the rainbow.</p>
<p>canada does not make it easy…canada makes us prove the genuinity of our love…the intensity of our commitment to our immigration efforts and often tests us to the breaking point of our ability to prove our love to the new country we want to call home…</p>
<p>it’s sometimes a lonely journey until we find the many others that have committed to the opportunity to start afresh.</p>
<p>this is an education challenge…a chance to give those who need to talk the ability to share their stories and those who have been here for years a new perspective on the many facettes of what immigration means to those who commit to it.</p>
<p>all this and much more is what your belief has allowed us to accomplish…we thank you more than words can say…because it means the world to us…because it is our world…the world of a new life…far away from the life we know. ♥</p>
<p>Our promise to you continues to ring true:<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>For every $25 donation you contribute, we promise to send you a signed hardcover copy of <em>Our Canadian Love Story</em>. Unless we know you. Then we will deliver it in person.</p>
<p><strong>All of our <em>thank yous </em>make beautiful gifts.</strong></p>
<p>Of course there are many other special <em>thank yous</em> to be had...like signed and numbered copies of Rebecca's original illustrations for the book, <em>thank you</em> mentions, in print, forever or even your very own custom character.</p>
<p>I would be happy to customize my author's message for you or imagine owning your very own character. A twelve string acoustic guitar playing owl (already taken), a bongo playing panda or a trumpeting giraffe? Your character will be part of el señor Giacomo and mademoiselle Jacqueline's band. Of course we will introduce the cast in the <em>thank you </em>section of our book. Perhaps you'd like to dedicate a character to your child, your niece, your unborn baby? You could also dedicate the <em>Thank You</em> to your business, your rotary club or pretty much anyone you like.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/643571/pictures/full/20130201151235-i_heart_canada.png?1359760359"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>More support equals a more awesome package for you filled with more love from us. </strong></p>
<p>By publishing <em>Our Canadian Love Story</em> we sincerely hope that our little tale will inspire dialogue within your families, schools &amp; playgroups about what immigration means to the fabric of our joint Canadian life.</p>
<p>And if you’re feeling a little less philosophical: then it’s simply a whimsical tale about two jackrabbits who fall in love...with each other and with Canada.</p>
<p>El señor Giacomo and mademoiselle Jacqueline, the main jackrabbits of our tale, arrive in Canada much like you did…or maybe your mom and dad or gran and pop, or oma and opa, or nonna and nonno, or grand-père and grand-mère*…because somebody they knew said to them:</p>
<p>“There is a place where the horizon is endless. Where the sky dances with the light that is the music of our planet and where the ground is dusted in white diamond powder. And the best part is, that it tastes and smells like sweet sugary maple, right from the Atlantic coast on the East all the way to the Pacific coast on the West.”</p>
<p>Help them pack their bag in a land far away from ours. Learn why jackrabbit fur changes colour. Watch them chug a spoonful of courage and fly to Canada on an Air Canada Goose flight. And finally wave at them as they arrive at Terminal 1 of Canada International Airport.</p>
<p>Take a seat in the front row as they fall in love and start a band.</p>
<p><strong>What will your belief &amp; support help us achieve other than a dance over the rainbow? </strong></p>

<p>I wrote <em>Our Canadian Love Story</em> on three Air Canada puke bags. The story spilled out in one go and turbulences didn't allow me to reach for my notebook. You will agree that said bags are no suitable medium for a children's tale and even less so for a tale about love.</p>
<p>Rebecca is so magicaly gifted and I feel so blessed that she imagined my words into pictures.</p>

We're beaming and crying all at the same time. Your belief means the world to us and we are eternally grateful. ♥
We're starting work on the FRENCH & INUKTITUT ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ translation of Our Canadian Love Story. 
Our little love tale has made it to indiegogo's homepage and took their twitter campaign of the day. Air Canada featured us in a fantastic interview and we're mighty proud of how much love and support you've shown us. It's been a remarkable ride as well as a full time job. 
You have made our publishing dream come true. Thanks to all of your donations Our Canadian Love Story will soon be printed and now el señor Giacomo and mademoiselle Jacqueline officially get to fall in love. 
It only took 160 of you to make Rebecca and I dance across the rainbow...and then the contributions just kept coming. Remarkable. We're humbled and speechless.
Linnie's love letter to funders and to Canada:
♥ on march 7th you made our dream come true. rebecca and i are dancing across the rainbow and you’re the ones holding our hands. this dream has been about so much more than just publishing ‘our canadian love story’.
this book is linnie’s ‘thank you’ note to the many canadians that have left their homes and families, waved their loved ones good bye in the place they’ve known and adored, in the hope of turning a page and starting their own 'canadian love story'.
i cannot wait to talk to children and parents all over canada about the hardship they’ve endured to make a new life in a foreign place…a place we all want to call home…a place we take pride in…a place we finally hope to belong to…and a place we know we can give our all to. we’re not here because our homes aren’t livable, but because we come with the united hope of contributing in a place that will appreciate our efforts.
the reasons we come here are as diverse as the colours of the beaches around the world…our stories are our own…our pains are shared…and the hopes that unite us dance along the same spectrum of the rainbow.
canada does not make it easy…canada makes us prove the genuinity of our love…the intensity of our commitment to our immigration efforts and often tests us to the breaking point of our ability to prove our love to the new country we want to call home…
it’s sometimes a lonely journey until we find the many others that have committed to the opportunity to start afresh.
this is an education challenge…a chance to give those who need to talk the ability to share their stories and those who have been here for years a new perspective on the many facettes of what immigration means to those who commit to it.
all this and much more is what your belief has allowed us to accomplish…we thank you more than words can say…because it means the world to us…because it is our world…the world of a new life…far away from the life we know. ♥
Our promise to you continues to ring true:
For every $25 donation you contribute, we promise to send you a signed hardcover copy of Our Canadian Love Story. Unless we know you. Then we will deliver it in person.
All of our thank yous make beautiful gifts.
Of course there are many other special thank yous to be had...like signed and numbered copies of Rebecca's original illustrations for the book, thank you mentions, in print, forever or even your very own custom character.
I would be happy to customize my author's message for you or imagine owning your very own character. A twelve string acoustic guitar playing owl (already taken), a bongo playing panda or a trumpeting giraffe? Your character will be part of el señor Giacomo and mademoiselle Jacqueline's band. Of course we will introduce the cast in the thank you section of our book. Perhaps you'd like to dedicate a character to your child, your niece, your unborn baby? You could also dedicate the Thank You to your business, your rotary club or pretty much anyone you like.
More support equals a more awesome package for you filled with more love from us. 
By publishing Our Canadian Love Story we sincerely hope that our little tale will inspire dialogue within your families, schools & playgroups about what immigration means to the fabric of our joint Canadian life.
And if you’re feeling a little less philosophical: then it’s simply a whimsical tale about two jackrabbits who fall in love...with each other and with Canada.
El señor Giacomo and mademoiselle Jacqueline, the main jackrabbits of our tale, arrive in Canada much like you did…or maybe your mom and dad or gran and pop, or oma and opa, or nonna and nonno, or grand-père and grand-mère*…because somebody they knew said to them:
“There is a place where the horizon is endless. Where the sky dances with the light that is the music of our planet and where the ground is dusted in white diamond powder. And the best part is, that it tastes and smells like sweet sugary maple, right from the Atlantic coast on the East all the way to the Pacific coast on the West.”
Help them pack their bag in a land far away from ours. Learn why jackrabbit fur changes colour. Watch them chug a spoonful of courage and fly to Canada on an Air Canada Goose flight. And finally wave at them as they arrive at Terminal 1 of Canada International Airport.
Take a seat in the front row as they fall in love and start a band.
What will your belief & support help us achieve other than a dance over the rainbow? 

I wrote Our Canadian Love Story on three Air Canada puke bags. The story spilled out in one go and turbulences didn't allow me to reach for my notebook. You will agree that said bags are no suitable medium for a children's tale and even less so for a tale about love.
Rebecca is so magicaly gifted and I feel so blessed that she imagined my words into pictures.
Together we are on the road to self-publishing.

* get our acronyms right
* ISBN, EAN, CIP want more?
* there’s a lot of stuff that goes on books and some of it costs money
When will you get to hold your thank you?
This is an all or nothing campaign. Because we have already made our goal we can officially honour all of your Thank Yous.
We are hoping to publish asap. If things stay on track we will be able to ship out your thank you much sooner than August 1st. It goes without saying that we will keep you posted.
Other ways you can help us?

* Bribe YOUR favourite social media folks to toot our horn
* This is the time to rally up your mom, uncle and grandma to show them how easy Indiegogo makes sharing things on facebook & twitter.

</div>
<p>
</p><p>Hello.
I’m Deane Driscoll, and I am an astrologer.  </p>
<p>For
me, astrology has been much more than a hobby, much more than a profession
even.  It has been my calling.</p>
<p><b>MY STORY</b></p>
<p>I
was very fortunate to know early in life what my true calling was. Because many
still don't know that at midlife.  I began studying astrology when I was
in grade school.  But in fact, it was my father who actually inspired me
to want to know more about the planets and stars; although that was never
actually his intention.</p>
<p>My
father was a dreamer, and all his dreams were of the sea.  He loved
sailing.  And somewhere along the way, he learned how to navigate using
the night sky.  So he knew many of the constellations.  One fateful,
clear, 4th of July night we went up to lay on our rooftop and watch the
neighboring fireworks.  It was quite the show.  But that was nothing
compared to what came next. After the fireworks died down enough to see the
stars, and everything grew quiet again, my father pointed skyward and began
naming them for me.  He pointed the constellations out as they rose in the
sky and told me their stories.  Because the sky, as it turns out, is
absolutely <i>chock </i>full of stories.  </p>
<p>As
my father talked that night, a lightbulb went on over my head and I suddenly
realized:  'THE SKY IS ORGANIZED!'  I was about 10 years old at the
time and this was an <i>immense</i> revelation to me.  Up until that point
I had assumed that the pretty light show above our heads was random.  I
was gobsmacked, flabbergasted and more importantly I was hooked.  There
was no going back at that point.  I was going to be an astrologer. 
 Because what I most wanted to know was this: <i>Is the organization
above our heads a language—one that we might one day learn?</i></p>
<p>Turns
out, it is, and we can.  And if there's a language, then someone put it
there.  Someone who very much wants to communicate.  So for me, when
I look up, I see a love letter from our creator, and I want to know what it
says.  And when I read someone’s natal chart—that most important and unique
blueprint they brought with them into this life—I am translating a very ancient
and beautiful code: the language of the heavens. And though it is ancient, this
language is not dead.  Far from it.  The sky above us is alive with
movement—everything is constantly in motion up there. And this movement tells
us what time it is.  Celestially speaking, the entire cosmos is engaged in
a sort of dance.  Some months it's a delicate, graceful waltz and other
months it's an all out rave! And if you know how to read it, you'll know which
dance to do when.  You see, in addition to being a sailor, my father was
also a musician.  He played the drums.  Rhythm filled our house.
 Perhaps that's why I can look up and 'see' the dance now. </p>
<p>For
more than 30 years the obsession with this cosmic dance has been both my

<p><b>NEW MOON BALLROOM</b></p>
<p>Years
ago I wrote a monthly column on the sky for a small local paper. It was to help introduce people to astrology and what it can do.  I called it
'The New Moon Ballroom' and I compared the movement of the moon and planets
each month to a particular dance.  Even though we live very different lives from one another, we do all share the same sky.  And that means we all share some universal themes as well.  The idea was to help people stay in step
with the rhythm of the sky each month.  Because what happens above us is mirrored
here on earth (As above, so below; as within, so without; as the universe, so
the soul).  To illustrate how absolutely
fascinating astrology is, I've written up a quick peek at
what the July skies might have in store for us all.</p>
<p>A new moon occurs when
the Sun and Moon form a conjunction or pairing in the sky, and come together in
the same sign of the zodiac.  This occurs approximately once per month
(or, about every 28 days). It marks a time when we <i>begin again</i> as far as
our goals are concerned.  Isn't it wonderful to know that we get to 'reboot' some part of our lives each month?  If you know
your own natal chart, you can make each new moon more personal by
seeing where it impacts your individual horoscope.  And if you don’t know it, guess who can tell
you?  Yes, that’s right!  Call your friendly local Astrologer.</p>
<p><b>The New Moon</b> for July will occur on
July 26<sup>th</sup> in the sign of Leo the Lion, the sign of courage, children,
creativity, performing, and recreation. 
This new moon is doing an energetic watusi, so put your dancing shoes on!  It also happens to be conjunct (sitting with) Jupiter and this
should bring prosperous and happy new opportunities to develop your creativity.  Bonus points if you actually use creativity
in your projects at work; they should grow in both number and scope now.  And Jupiter should help boost your confidence
to get out there and have your ideas heard or seen.   Some of us will even have spectacular new opportunities coming our way.</p>
<p><b>Saturn, </b>which has been retrograding since March 2nd,<b> </b>finally goes direct on
July 20<sup>th</sup>.  When Saturn retrograded (a retrograding planet appears to be slowing down and traveling backward) it gummed up the
works for a lot of people in their careers. 
Projects may have stalled or been back-burnered for awhile. But at the
end of July, as Saturn goes direct again, your careers should stop stagnating
and get up and running again.  For some this
means being very busy, and if you combine this with the Leo/Jupiter new moon,
you may suddenly have more work than you can handle.  Saturn direct is also good news for real estate (both buying and selling). So get ready, but remember to have fun while
you’re at it.  Leo is the sign of
recreation, after all.  This is only a small portion of the dance the heavens are doing now, but it gives you a small idea of what's possible with astrology.</p>
<p>Remember,
it’s only a dance.  Each month the planets will teach you a new one.
 And we can all afford to learn a few new steps every now and again. 
So play, smile, be kind.  Then look up and
thank your lucky stars!</p><p><br/></p>

<br/><p></p></div>","Hello.
I’m Deane Driscoll, and I am an astrologer.  
For
me, astrology has been much more than a hobby, much more than a profession
even.  It has been my calling.
MY STORY
I
was very fortunate to know early in life what my true calling was. Because many
still don't know that at midlife.  I began studying astrology when I was
in grade school.  But in fact, it was my father who actually inspired me
to want to know more about the planets and stars; although that was never
actually his intention.
My
father was a dreamer, and all his dreams were of the sea.  He loved
sailing.  And somewhere along the way, he learned how to navigate using
the night sky.  So he knew many of the constellations.  One fateful,
clear, 4th of July night we went up to lay on our rooftop and watch the
neighboring fireworks.  It was quite the show.  But that was nothing
compared to what came next. After the fireworks died down enough to see the
stars, and everything grew quiet again, my father pointed skyward and began
naming them for me.  He pointed the constellations out as they rose in the
sky and told me their stories.  Because the sky, as it turns out, is
absolutely chock full of stories.  
As
my father talked that night, a lightbulb went on over my head and I suddenly
realized:  'THE SKY IS ORGANIZED!'  I was about 10 years old at the
time and this was an immense revelation to me.  Up until that point
I had assumed that the pretty light show above our heads was random.  I
was gobsmacked, flabbergasted and more importantly I was hooked.  There
was no going back at that point.  I was going to be an astrologer. 
 Because what I most wanted to know was this: Is the organization
above our heads a language—one that we might one day learn?
Turns
out, it is, and we can.  And if there's a language, then someone put it
there.  Someone who very much wants to communicate.  So for me, when
I look up, I see a love letter from our creator, and I want to know what it
says.  And when I read someone’s natal chart—that most important and unique
blueprint they brought with them into this life—I am translating a very ancient
and beautiful code: the language of the heavens. And though it is ancient, this
language is not dead.  Far from it.  The sky above us is alive with
movement—everything is constantly in motion up there. And this movement tells
us what time it is.  Celestially speaking, the entire cosmos is engaged in
a sort of dance.  Some months it's a delicate, graceful waltz and other
months it's an all out rave! And if you know how to read it, you'll know which
dance to do when.  You see, in addition to being a sailor, my father was
also a musician.  He played the drums.  Rhythm filled our house.
 Perhaps that's why I can look up and 'see' the dance now. 
For
more than 30 years the obsession with this cosmic dance has been both my
calling and my spiritual journey--watching the dance and telling others what
steps they'll need to learn.  And, though it is not possible to know
everything about astrology (one of my favorite things about it, by the way), after
a lifetime of studying and teaching it, I now find myself in the position of
having something to say about it all.  Something original.  And I’d
like to say it in writing.
MY GOAL
The
book I am writing is called (surprise) 'The Cosmic Dance.'  It
is the culmination of everything I have learned about how we are connected to
the cosmos.  If you contribute to my project you will be helping me to
bring a lifetime of experience to others—astrologers and non-astrologers alike.
 And you will have helped to preserve this wisdom for the next generation
of astrologers and seekers yet to be.  My goal is to have a finished
manuscript by Christmas, 2014.  If you've ever written a book, you'll
know how ambitious a goal this is.  But this is my dream.  So, to
those of you who might like to help me put my book out there, I want to say
‘thank-you.' Your contribution and good will is invaluable to me. And your
support will help me to realize a very cherished personal dream.

Saturn, which has been retrograding since March 2nd, finally goes direct on
July 20th.  When Saturn retrograded (a retrograding planet appears to be slowing down and traveling backward) it gummed up the
works for a lot of people in their careers.

<h3>About The Book<br/>
</h3> <p>Godfall Golden is a story about privacy in the digital age, the psychology of expectations, and a New York City changed forever by catastrophe. I wanted to write the kind of book I could both see myself in and lose myself in, featuring a gay perspective that feels naturally integrated and adds up to more than a tortured coming-out allegory. Godfall Golden is my magical science-fiction daydream, written as a ""what the hell is going on here"" book that I hope will keep surprising you until the end. <a href=""http://www.brokenlightning.com/vimnaide/Pride-2014-GG-Preview.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read a sample here!</a><br/></p>
<p>As <a href=""http://www.jonathanvcann.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my sixth novel</a> and a sequel to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Broken-Lightning-Legend-Qi-Symbol/dp/0989485234/ref=pd_rhf_gw_p_tnr_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Broken Lightning: Legend of the Qi Symbol</a>, Godfall Golden benefits from the experience of an established writer and self-publisher, and comes with a deep mythology (including a fictional language) that you can engage with as much or as little as you want. I've never been more excited about a project, and now, I'm asking for your help to make it a success.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/887645/files/20140928074320-20140928_GG-Cover-IGG.jpg?1411915400"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Cover art by Christopher Curry John O'Connell; photography by Ace Salisbury.</i><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>About My Goal<br/>
</h3> <p>The $5,000 I'm hoping to raise will cover Godfall Golden's production costs, including:<br/></p> <ul>
<li>Payments to my team: editor, cover designer, publicity trainer, etc. I strongly believe in giving freelance employees a fair and equitable rate for their skilled contributions to this project, which would not have been possible without them. </li> <li>Setup fees such as ISBN registration, web hosting, and proof copies of the book itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've chosen flexible funding for this project because any amount that I can raise will help defer these costs.<br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There shouldn't be much risk for you as an investor: Godfall Golden has already been fully written and edited, so all rewards that include a copy of the book should deliver as promised, and the actual release date (December 2nd 2014, with a soft launch on December 1st) should stay firm. Any physical rewards carry some risk of shipping delays beyond my control, and of course there could always be random unforeseen circumstances, but especially after launching so many previous books, I think I'm well prepared.</p>
<p>The primary risk of this project is on my side. I want Godfall Golden to reach a wider and more appropriate audience than any of my books have before, and I want it to serve as an example that the Hushed Forest Entertainment publishing model can be sustainable long-term (see ""What's Next?"" below). As such, I've made a pretty big up-front investment in the book, and I have high expectations for its performance. How well the book's actual performance matches those expectations will have a big impact on my ability to approach similar projects in the future.</p>
<p>Making sure Godfall Golden does well is also my #1 challenge, because although I've spent the last several months building a ""platform"" of Facebook fans and Twitter followers, I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a marketing expert, and I don't have any industry connections or anything like that to help me get publicity. That means I'll be leaning very heavily on word-of-mouth--hoping that people who believe in me will show the project to their friends--and stimulating that is something I'm only going to learn as I go. Every dollar, every comment, and every share helps!<br/></p>
<ul></ul>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What's Next?<br/>
</h3> <p>Godfall Golden is being released under the Hushed Forest Entertainment imprint, a pseudo-micropress I created to help give all of my books a uniform and professional look. The Internet has drastically changed the face of publishing, and I want to help prove that an ordinary person can produce a successful, market-grade product without needing the approval of the establishment or the 1%.<br/></p>

</div></div>","In a future where curiosity has been outlawed, Ross Bridell,
a language genius working at one of the last private detective agencies, thinks
he and the ghost of his ex-boyfriend can still work things out. But there's
more than one ghost stuck inside Ross's head, and as half a dozen voices fight
for control, Ross finds himself being drawn toward an impossible apocalypse in
the making. Teaming up with Neal Pendleton, a young man diagnosed with
excessive inquisitiveness disorder, Ross sets out to pry the truth behind
what's happening to him from a city that doesn't like questions. The old world
is already gone. Which world will die next?
About The Book
 Godfall Golden is a story about privacy in the digital age, the psychology of expectations, and a New York City changed forever by catastrophe. I wanted to write the kind of book I could both see myself in and lose myself in, featuring a gay perspective that feels naturally integrated and adds up to more than a tortured coming-out allegory. Godfall Golden is my magical science-fiction daydream, written as a ""what the hell is going on here"" book that I hope will keep surprising you until the end. Read a sample here!
As my sixth novel and a sequel to Broken Lightning: Legend of the Qi Symbol, Godfall Golden benefits from the experience of an established writer and self-publisher, and comes with a deep mythology (including a fictional language) that you can engage with as much or as little as you want. I've never been more excited about a project, and now, I'm asking for your help to make it a success.


Cover art by Christopher Curry John O'Connell; photography by Ace Salisbury.
  About My Goal
 The $5,000 I'm hoping to raise will cover Godfall Golden's production costs, including: 
Payments to my team: editor, cover designer, publicity trainer, etc. I strongly believe in giving freelance employees a fair and equitable rate for their skilled contributions to this project, which would not have been possible without them.  Setup fees such as ISBN registration, web hosting, and proof copies of the book itself.

I've chosen flexible funding for this project because any amount that I can raise will help defer these costs.

  Risks & Challenges There shouldn't be much risk for you as an investor: Godfall Golden has already been fully written and edited, so all rewards that include a copy of the book should deliver as promised, and the actual release date (December 2nd 2014, with a soft launch on December 1st) should stay firm. Any physical rewards carry some risk of shipping delays beyond my control, and of course there could always be random unforeseen circumstances, but especially after launching so many previous books, I think I'm well prepared.
The primary risk of this project is on my side. I want Godfall Golden to reach a wider and more appropriate audience than any of my books have before, and I want it to serve as an example that the Hushed Forest Entertainment publishing model can be sustainable long-term (see ""What's Next?"" below). As such, I've made a pretty big up-front investment in the book, and I have high expectations for its performance. How well the book's actual performance matches those expectations will have a big impact on my ability to approach similar projects in the future.
Making sure Godfall Golden does well is also my #1 challenge, because although I've spent the last several months building a ""platform"" of Facebook fans and Twitter followers, I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a marketing expert, and I don't have any industry connections or anything like that to help me get publicity. That means I'll be leaning very heavily on word-of-mouth--hoping that people who believe in me will show the project to their friends--and stimulating that is something I'm only going to learn as I go. Every dollar, every comment, and every share helps!


 
What's Next?
 Godfall Golden is being released under the Hushed Forest Entertainment imprint, a pseudo-micropress I created to help give all of my books a uniform and professional look. The Internet has drastically changed the face of publishing, and I want to help prove that an ordinary person can produce a successful, market-grade product without needing the approval of the establishment or the 1%.
If Godfall Golden sells well and helps me build a reasonably sized audience, you can expect to see more books (and other types of media) released under the Hushed Forest umbrella. Just as importantly, if I succeed, I want to help others who come after me succeed, too--I won't feel like I've done enough if I'm the only one who benefits. A donation to the Godfall Golden project will help build Hushed Forest's credibility and reach, so that when I feature other artists' work on Facebook or Twitter, I'll be able to do more to help them achieve their dreams. I may even want to go into production someday, i.e., publish a book for someone else I believe in. These are all doors I've left open, and Godfall Golden's performance will have a big impact on how and when I'll consider myself ready to walk through them.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>My Venus Flytrap Won’t Open. My book is about female sexual health and sexuality in the US, specifically focusing on demystifying some of the sexual health issues women face that often go unnoticed or untreated.<br/><br/>My name is Danielle and I am the author of My Venus Fly Trap Won’t Open. I wrote this book because I realized, from personal experiences and from talking with my friends, that there are people being left out of the sex positivity movement because their specific issues are often unacknowledged. This problem starts when we fail to prioritize female sexual health or play into inappropriate sexuality stereotypes, which bleeds into our sexual education system, representation in media, and even the doctor’s office. I wanted to call attention to these issues and the drastic consequences that arise when we ignore them.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will gain a broader understanding of positive sexuality and sexual health. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for female sexual empowerment in you. And, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you continue these conversations, recognize these issues, and advocate for more comprehensive sexual education and representation. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about commonly misdiagnosed female sexual health issues and commonly misrepresented ideas about “normal” female sexuality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debunking the damaging “sex is supposed to be painful” trope - Vera’s story with vulvodynia and forcing herself to consent to painful sex</li>
<li>How physical disability can be emotionally damaging to one’s sense of sexuality - Trista McGovern’s journey of sexuality discovery and acceptance that landed her in Vogue magazine</li>
<li>Why trans health is overlooked - Morgan Givens’ story of dismissal and incompetence from doctors as a trans male with very specific health needs</li>
</ul>You will love this book if you identify as a woman or are female assigned at birth and experience any of these issues, or if you are interested in progressing sexual equality, education and care.<br/><br/>My Venus Flytrap Won’t Open is a non-fiction book that speaks to women, educators, and parents who are looking at underrepresented female sexual health and sexuality topics for the first time.<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - My Venus Flytrap Won’t Open</h3>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the Introduction + 3 additional chapters. This section will introduce the concept of “sex positivity” and provide a brief history of sexual health education in the US. This background context will lead into an exploration of why and how female sexual health issues are consistently dismissed within the medical field. <br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 4-11. This section will examine how sexuality issues are often overlooked if they do not fit the “norm."" From first-hand accounts, the reader will learn about vaginal and vulvar pain issues, premenstrual disorders, disability health, and trans health. Part 2 will conclude with Tasneem Raja’s story, a discussion on female genital mutilation practices and human rights violations against women and girls in the US.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 12-14. The final section of the book will analyze the intersectionality of these issues and groups to highlight the additional barriers that layers of discrimination create in accessing health care. The final chapters will bring in the stories of Dr. Jen Chu and Dr. Jennifer Lincoln to emphasize the importance, and attainability, of doctors and medical systems that validate and are knowledgeable of women’s sexual health concerns. <br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December, 2020.</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to make help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this Winter.</li>
</ul>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>

<p>The concept for The Magical Closet was inspired by a  decade of experience travelling as a nanny and french teacher.  Experience that showed me how children were more responsive and engaged to learn through stories. This lead me to numerous books, studies and research on the subject that convinced me for good:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Story was the magical key to the infinite kingdom of learning.</strong></p>
<p>The traditional bilingual book is most of the time picture dictionary or translations, which isn’t very attractive to children.  Through stories, they are engaged, they work to find the words’ meaning  while having fun along the way with the added bonus of learning. </p>
<p>Storytelling is the original form of teaching. Learning with stories is the best, most  effective, natural and fun way to learn a new language. Children absorb  and learn the language without realizing it while enjoying a good  story. Stories not only create a sense of connection, they build  familiarity and trust, which make the reader and listener more open to  learning.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong><i>While this campaign has closed, </i>The Algerian Dream<i> is still available for pre-order <a href=""https://www.ibnibnbattuta.com/p/the-algerian-dream.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here via Ibn Ibn Battuta</a>.</i></p>
<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>The Algerian Dream</i> is the story of an ambitious young generation pursuing their dreams against all odds—and reshaping their society in the process.</p>
<p>My name is Andrew G. Farrand, and I am the author of <i>The Algerian Dream</i>. For the last seven years, I had the privilege of living and working in Algeria and getting to know many young Algerians along the way. Algeria is North Africa’s sleeping giant: a vast yet isolated country that almost never makes international headlines. Few outsiders know or understand the complex dynamics driving recent events there—including the peaceful revolution that swept Algeria in 2019 and that remains unresolved today.</p>
<p>I wrote this book to share with the world the fascinating transformations I witnessed firsthand in Algeria, with a focus on the young people who are increasingly pressing for change from the bottom up.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what makes Algeria the most mesmerizing yet perplexing, the most beguiling yet frustrating, and the most peculiar country on Earth, yet one that still holds universal lessons. In the book, you will learn about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why young Algerians yearn for genuine political voice, yet boycott every election</li>
<li>The slow collapse of public services, and my own encounters with Algeria’s medical system</li>
<li>How vast oil wealth has enriched officials and financed the world’s most expensive highway, but failed to trickle down</li>
<li>What I learned among the crowds of Algeria’s peaceful protest movement—and from the backlash it provoked</li>
<li>How young people grapple with historical legacies of valor and violence, torn between embracing or escaping them</li>
<li>Young Algerians’ profound sense of justice, and their dreams of dignified lives in their homeland</li>
<li>...and much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you know nothing about Algeria or are Algerian yourself, you will find much to love in this book. Curious minds and critical thinkers will enjoy diving deep into a fascinating context largely unknown to the outside world, and pondering the social, political, cultural, and economic forces that shape human societies.</p>
<p><i>The Algerian Dream</i> is a non-fiction book combining rich analysis with poignant, outlandish, and sometimes humorous stories from my years in Algeria. Written for popular audiences rather than academic ones, <i>The Algerian Dream</i> invites readers to plunge into this unique country and emerge with new insights about the dynamics driving our modern world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Inside the Book</h3>
<p><i>The Algerian Dream</i> weaves first-person stories, interviews, and analysis in a style already familiar to readers of my blog.</p>
<ul>
<li>The book begins with a <strong>Prologue and Introduction</strong> to set the scene, explain how in the world I ended up in Algeria, and introduce Algeria’s ambitious young generations. It presents eight key pillars—from political voice to cultural expression, justice to economic opportunity—that young Algerians consider essential to a dignified life.</li>
<li>
<strong>Part One</strong> (Chapters 1 through 8) examines these eight pillars in detail, exploring what exactly young Algerians expect—and where their society has or has not satisfied those expectations. It focuses on the critical interim period that followed the Arab Spring—and that built pressure for a very different sort of revolution.</li>
<li>
<strong>Part Two</strong> (Chapters 9 through 12) dissects the peaceful protest movement that ignited in 2019, its causes and implications, the changes it wrought, and the counter-reactions it provoked. It examines the <i>hirak</i> protest movement’s evolution in the face of government repression, a global pandemic, and other shocks, and what it all means for Algeria's future.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have launched this pre-sale campaign to offset the initial costs of publishing my book with New Degree Press. The funds raised will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Editor</strong> I am working with to revise my manuscript and publish in April 2021</li>
<li>The <strong>Cover Design</strong> of my book (The images you see now are just placeholders!)</li>
<li>The <strong>Layout Design</strong> for my book’s interior text and images</li>
<li>The <strong>Copy Editing</strong> for my book, in order to polish it to perfection</li>

Story of My Book
The Algerian Dream is the story of an ambitious young generation pursuing their dreams against all odds—and reshaping their society in the process.
My name is Andrew G. Farrand, and I am the author of The Algerian Dream. For the last seven years, I had the privilege of living and working in Algeria and getting to know many young Algerians along the way. Algeria is North Africa’s sleeping giant: a vast yet isolated country that almost never makes international headlines. Few outsiders know or understand the complex dynamics driving recent events there—including the peaceful revolution that swept Algeria in 2019 and that remains unresolved today.
I wrote this book to share with the world the fascinating transformations I witnessed firsthand in Algeria, with a focus on the young people who are increasingly pressing for change from the bottom up.
My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what makes Algeria the most mesmerizing yet perplexing, the most beguiling yet frustrating, and the most peculiar country on Earth, yet one that still holds universal lessons. In the book, you will learn about:

Why young Algerians yearn for genuine political voice, yet boycott every election
The slow collapse of public services, and my own encounters with Algeria’s medical system
How vast oil wealth has enriched officials and financed the world’s most expensive highway, but failed to trickle down
What I learned among the crowds of Algeria’s peaceful protest movement—and from the backlash it provoked
How young people grapple with historical legacies of valor and violence, torn between embracing or escaping them
Young Algerians’ profound sense of justice, and their dreams of dignified lives in their homeland
...and much more!

Whether you know nothing about Algeria or are Algerian yourself, you will find much to love in this book. Curious minds and critical thinkers will enjoy diving deep into a fascinating context largely unknown to the outside world, and pondering the social, political, cultural, and economic forces that shape human societies.
The Algerian Dream is a non-fiction book combining rich analysis with poignant, outlandish, and sometimes humorous stories from my years in Algeria. Written for popular audiences rather than academic ones, The Algerian Dream invites readers to plunge into this unique country and emerge with new insights about the dynamics driving our modern world.

Inside the Book
The Algerian Dream weaves first-person stories, interviews, and analysis in a style already familiar to readers of my blog.

The book begins with a Prologue and Introduction to set the scene, explain how in the world I ended up in Algeria, and introduce Algeria’s ambitious young generations. It presents eight key pillars—from political voice to cultural expression, justice to economic opportunity—that young Algerians consider essential to a dignified life.

Part One (Chapters 1 through 8) examines these eight pillars in detail, exploring what exactly young Algerians expect—and where their society has or has not satisfied those expectations. It focuses on the critical interim period that followed the Arab Spring—and that built pressure for a very different sort of revolution.

Part Two (Chapters 9 through 12) dissects the peaceful protest movement that ignited in 2019, its causes and implications, the changes it wrought, and the counter-reactions it provoked. It examines the hirak protest movement’s evolution in the face of government repression, a global pandemic, and other shocks, and what it all means for Algeria's future.

<h3><u>Story of My Book</u></h3>
<p>It’s hard to find someone who doesn’t enjoy massive success and self-growth, and yet self-help books are often cheesy, repetitive, and downright ineffective. If you’re anything like me, you want to achieve enormous goals quickly without wading through pages and pages of crap. That’s why I wrote this book.<br/><br/><i>The Archimedes Lever: The Hidden Factors of Exponential Success</i> is about how to achieve massive, “moonshot”-level success in record time, without the bull. By exploring the habits and tactics of Silicon Valley thought leaders to ancient Stoic philosophers, this book illuminates the key factors that will <strong>exponentially</strong> increase your output potential and elevate your achievements beyond anything you thought possible.<br/><br/>My name is Alyssa Mavor and I am the author of <i>The Archimedes Lever</i>. I wrote this book because, though I love self development, I grew tired of classic self-help genre tropes like, “The key to success is waking up at 5am,” and “Make your bed every morning to start your day feeling accomplished”. I <i>knew</i> there must be larger, drastically more important components to exponential success. In my book, I explore the bigger principles that can dramatically change your success trajectory, be it in your career or personal life.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about everything from how to enter flow state to creating a personal knowledge management system. We'll explore:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>How Elon Musk uses First Principles Thinking to tackle complex problems, like building a rocket</li>
<li>Adele’s secret tactic to conquering fear</li>
<li>How conscious serendipity created ancient Egyptian sourdough bread in the 21st century</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>In reading this book, you will discover the most important factors and strategies to achieve your personal moonshot. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion I have for consistently leveling up my personal systems, habits, and behaviors. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you do the thing that your heart has always wanted you accomplish.</p>
<p><i>The Archimedes Lever: The Hidden Factors of Exponential Success</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to ambitious individuals and entrepreneurs with enormous dreams who want to stop wasting their time and get on the fast track to magnificent personal achievement. This book isn’t for the faint of heart, but it is for the ones who want to make their moonshot a reality.</p>

<h3>Story of Adaptable Success</h3>
<p><strong><i>Adaptable Success </i></strong>is a book about the focus on soft skills learned and developed from the arts creative process of acting, dance, music and intersecting with the business world adding value to the workforce development.</p>
<p>My name is Erik Waller and I am the author of <i>Adaptable Success</i>. I wrote this book because I am a trained actor and advocate of the performing arts which is where my passion lies. During the pandemic it was hard to find performance opportunities so I turned to writing as a creative outlet. As we transition into the virtual/digital revolution, I wanted to focus on hard/soft skills, especially the soft ""power"" skills that will be most transferable to the virtual world in terms of adapting to other careers successfully.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how artists make invaluable productive employees in the public, private, and philanthropic sectors generating good business values and principles. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the soft skills developed by artists and folks with liberal arts degrees. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you realize that artists bring the soft skills essential to today's workforce and add value not only to the workforce but educationally and economically around the globe.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about things like...</p>
<ul>
<li>The soft skills essential for employees in the workforce development.</li>
<li>Educational and economical value of the arts.</li>
<li>Why STEAM and not just STEM should be a more concentrated focus in                                  America to for the education system.</li>
<li>Embedded creative arts experience with Robotics, Automation &amp; Artificial                               Intelligence partnerships.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are a thought leader and made professional and personal life transitions. The book speaks to aspiring performing artists, business leaders, educators of all levels, and professionals across most industries.</p>
<p><strong>The Book - <i>Adaptable Success</i></strong></p>
<p>The book is written in <strong>7 parts</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the <strong>Introduction &amp;</strong> <strong>Performing Artists Can be Valuable Employees.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Part 3</strong> contains <strong>Liberal Arts (STEAM) vs STEM</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Part 4 </strong>contains<strong> Economical Value of the Arts: Arts and Business Intersect and                                                    Perspectives from Artists &amp; Business Leaders</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part 5 </strong>contains<strong> My Vision and Arts for Social Change: Global Impact.</strong></p>

Adaptable Success is a book about the focus on soft skills learned and developed from the arts creative process of acting, dance, music and intersecting with the business world adding value to the workforce development.
My name is Erik Waller and I am the author of Adaptable Success. I wrote this book because I am a trained actor and advocate of the performing arts which is where my passion lies. During the pandemic it was hard to find performance opportunities so I turned to writing as a creative outlet. As we transition into the virtual/digital revolution, I wanted to focus on hard/soft skills, especially the soft ""power"" skills that will be most transferable to the virtual world in terms of adapting to other careers successfully.
My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how artists make invaluable productive employees in the public, private, and philanthropic sectors generating good business values and principles. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the soft skills developed by artists and folks with liberal arts degrees. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you realize that artists bring the soft skills essential to today's workforce and add value not only to the workforce but educationally and economically around the globe.
In this book, you'll learn about things like...

The soft skills essential for employees in the workforce development.
Educational and economical value of the arts.
Why STEAM and not just STEM should be a more concentrated focus in                                  America to for the education system.
Embedded creative arts experience with Robotics, Automation & Artificial                               Intelligence partnerships.

You will love this book if you are a thought leader and made professional and personal life transitions. The book speaks to aspiring performing artists, business leaders, educators of all levels, and professionals across most industries.
The Book - Adaptable Success
The book is written in 7 parts.
Part 1 contains the Introduction & Performing Artists Can be Valuable Employees.
Part 2 contains Educational Value of the Arts and Perspectives from Artists &                                                      Entrepreneurs.
Part 3 contains Liberal Arts (STEAM) vs STEM.
Part 4 contains Economical Value of the Arts: Arts and Business Intersect and                                                    Perspectives from Artists & Business Leaders
Part 5 contains My Vision and Arts for Social Change: Global Impact.
Part 6 contains How the Soft ""Power"" Skills Shape Organizational Behavior in the                                              Workplace. 
Part 7 contains Conclusion and The Future of the Performing Arts intersecting with RAAI.                               (Robotics, Automation and Artificial Intelligence)

International Preorders
For international preorders, please do the following:

Identify the perk that interests you, e.g. 1 or 2 paperbacks.
Select the pink ""Back it"" button to ""Make a contribution"" for the same amount (this choice bypasses the shipping address page).
Please DM me at erik.waller.pchn@gmail.com and share your mailing address, so I can calculate the international shipping costs and invoice you for that amount via PayPal/Venmo.


The Impact
Your support help advocate the educational & economical value and creative process of the Arts and Arts-in-Education programs nationally and internationally!  
Risk & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.
The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship.

Other Ways You Can Help
Not everyone can support, but that doesn't mean you can't get something out of it!
I will reward the top 3 people who refer the most backers at the end of the campaign (30 days). Here's how:

At the top of the campaign page, you will see the ""share"" buttons. Click on the ""chain"" icon to get a custom link just for you. (Note: don't use the URL in the browser window as it won't work to track referrals and you won't get credit.

Copy that link and paste it on your social media, email it to a friend, or text a fellow book lover.
When someone clicks on that link and backs the book, you get 1 entry!

Please use #softskills and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so we can help amplify your efforts!

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">""Why did I write the book?"" - A note from Chantelle</h3> <p>As it happens, the little penguin is me </p>
<p>Growing up, mum was my hero. I felt privileged that she was my mother. How was it that one woman had such an endless well of love to give? How was it that she could she calm every emotion, sooth every ailment, and liven any dull moment? By modern standards she was a young mother, yet had wisdom beyond her years.  Her tiny stature belied her fearlessness when protecting her children, and as a result we felt safe in her arms.  </p>
<p>Years later after overcoming an arduous fertility battle, I lay on the bed one evening, swollen belly and loving husband beside me. We pondered about what kind of parents we would be? How would we guide our son and instil in him good morals and values? How would we make him feel forever secure in our love? It was then that it dawned on me that this had been done before. It was time for me to become at least half the woman that my mother is (if not fill her shoes!) I was soon to be the mother.  </p>
<p>While I initially thought that this project was about my first steps into motherhood, I soon realised it was about much more than that. The little penguin journeying through life is my child, but it's also me, and you, and anyone who was lucky enough to have a loving adult pass on life’s most meaningful lessons.  </p>

<p>We have been really lucky to find and work with the incredibly talented artist Nicolas Lonprez. Nicolas is a passionate traveller, and his recent visit to Iceland inspired many of the illustrations in <strong>'A Little Penguin's Guide to Life'</strong> in particular, the amazing landscapes of crystal blue ice, volcanoes and the Aurora-Borealis.

<h3>My Story...</h3>My father died of a 
brain stem stroke in 2011... He didn't die instantly, instead he was 
trapped in a ""locked in"" state. A state where the brain and body are 
100% functional, but the brain stem is damaged and no communication can 
go between the two. They are left with only the ability to blink when 
asked questions. No head movement, just blinking. <br/><br/>As a software 
developer, I spent the last week of his life developing a book that would allow him to write a letter to my mom, one
 letter at a time, one set of blinks at a time... He died the night I 
brought it to him to use, yet never woke to use it...<br/><br/>Since
 that point, I have created and tested the book and I am happy to report that it is ready for mass production.  Publishing!<p><span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3> <p>In order to take this to the next level, and that is a published book that will get into the hands of those in need faster... I need the seed money to start the publishing process.  I have already been accepted by a major publisher and money is the only thing stopping me from achieving my goal...  Regardless if I get the entire goal or not, all money will go towards that publishing process, not a penny less!!!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

</div><br/></div>","My Story...My father died of a 
brain stem stroke in 2011... He didn't die instantly, instead he was 
trapped in a ""locked in"" state. A state where the brain and body are 
100% functional, but the brain stem is damaged and no communication can 
go between the two. They are left with only the ability to blink when 
asked questions. No head movement, just blinking. As a software 
developer, I spent the last week of his life developing a book that would allow him to write a letter to my mom, one
 letter at a time, one set of blinks at a time... He died the night I 
brought it to him to use, yet never woke to use it...Since
 that point, I have created and tested the book and I am happy to report that it is ready for mass production.  Publishing!


   
What We Need In order to take this to the next level, and that is a published book that will get into the hands of those in need faster... I need the seed money to start the publishing process.  I have already been accepted by a major publisher and money is the only thing stopping me from achieving my goal...  Regardless if I get the entire goal or not, all money will go towards that publishing process, not a penny less!!!

I’m Joe Henderson. I’m an Arctic explorer, author, dog trainer and sled
dog musher. My dogs have been featured in Walt Disney’s movie; “White Fang”
and many documentaries including Animal Planet.  I've spent 30 years pursuing
a passion of exploring the most remote regions of the Arctic with my dog
team.  During which time I have pioneered and perfected a method of
travel that is unprecedented in modern times, being the only person in written
history to ever have traveled solo with a dog team in the Arctic for up to four
months at a time without resupply.<b><i><span>  </span></i></b></p>
<p>Most

Arctic’s ecosystem and its wildlife. Today, I’m reaching out to the world to
help fund my latest project, “Young Old Man and His Dog”, a fiction novel which
highlights the Arctic’s brutal yet fragile environment and its wildlife and
also to inspire others whom have passions and dreams to never give
up!  </p>
<p><strong>

About The Book</strong></p>
<p>Much of the book is symbolism which the readers can relate life's everyday circumstances with. The story is about a man who follows his passion in search of a mysterious

He faces many hardships including a strange people who hunt him

the Arctic animals he succeeds in his endeavor and eventually discovers the
answer to the agonizing mystery that has driven him to the far reaches of the
Arctic.

Our Story</span></b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""HU"" style="""">Coming up soon on
our tenth year of marriage and five and a half years on our organic farm in
Southeastern Hungary, we have some experiences we are eager to share about the
art of living life sustainedly. The biggest and most wonderful realization
moment hit us when we were living on just USD 50.- a month, for the two of us,
two dogs and a couple of goats to feed. For 8 months, including the winter
season, this was coupled with the romance of living without electricity. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""HU"" style="""">All of these
overlapping experiences have culminated into a paradoxically stimulating
frustration with the world as we know it. We have instigated each other for a
long time now to put out our creative energies for the use of the larger
society as well, by education and within that, by writing our book.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""HU"" style="""">Our goal with all
of this is to begin filling a hiatus on the educational literature market that
gets down to the bone and marrow of the badly needed paradigm shift that in
turn will allow for carrying out the new thoughts into practice. This book we
are about to write is not going to list dozens of pages of literary references,
neither will it be fragmented by quotations of other theorists, in fact it will
contain none. We feel like this by itself will be an already refreshing feature
of the book<span style="""">  </span>– that is to dare think
originally. By presenting a new paradigm we intend to deliberate on practical
knowledge that is understandable by just about anyone, yet it digs deep into
the multi-dimensional web of life’s interconnectedness. Readers will be
rewarded by experience and intuition based practical advices, often outrageously
novel. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""HU"" style="""">In a series of
essays, grouped around more defined topics, we will elaborate on our ideas of a
sustained life – the ”sustainable” world taken further, turning it into
something unconditioned and leaving behind the presumption that it might not
work out. The issue at stake is not about pessimism or optimism, it is not
about expecting the bad or the good, it is not about fearsome or wishful
thinking: it is <i>finally about living intransigently in harmony with nature</i>.
</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""HU"" style="""">Our topics will
range from ”edible” clothing, zero waste households and businesses, minimum to
no soil disturbance gardening, local food production, communal sharing of goods
and services (such as skills and knowledge), creating new traditions that fit
the locale and the participants’ needs, connecting family education with
schooling of our children, rethinking and remaking their toys to foster wonder
and creativity. We will also touch on the fact that we should not fear death,
but rather embrace it as part of the continuity of life. One might say that any
of these topics have been talked about and that is true. It will be the
approach, the truly novel aspect of writing about them. For example, when we say
edible clothing, we mean it: to not wear anything that you could not ingest
without it being toxic to your body. By zero waste, we mean ZERO waste: in our
world everything we produce can and should be compostable or recyclable without
quality loss. Do not fall for the illusion that Christmas is about love and
family, you know that it is about giving and receiving, in other words it is a
season of gluttonous consumption. Can you refrain from the media induced buying frenzy? </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""HU"" style="""">We encourage
everyone to question EVERYTHING! </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><b><span lang=""HU"" style=""""><br/></span></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b><span lang=""HU"" style="""">What do you
get?</span></b></p>

your support we would love to give back to you some goods that come
from our
organic farm and family heritage. The products we offer as rewards are
all in
line with our sustainability-based thinking and philosophy that will be
put forth
in our book. You will receive the perk corresponding to your

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""HU"" style="""">Since we have
moved on the farm we have consciously made efforts and sacrifices to avoid
having to leave the farm for employment, searching for eco-friendly ways to
make a living. Despite the struggle we have found this a precious commitment

Our Story
Coming up soon on
our tenth year of marriage and five and a half years on our organic farm in
Southeastern Hungary, we have some experiences we are eager to share about the
art of living life sustainedly. The biggest and most wonderful realization
moment hit us when we were living on just USD 50.- a month, for the two of us,
two dogs and a couple of goats to feed. For 8 months, including the winter
season, this was coupled with the romance of living without electricity. 
All of these
overlapping experiences have culminated into a paradoxically stimulating
frustration with the world as we know it. We have instigated each other for a
long time now to put out our creative energies for the use of the larger
society as well, by education and within that, by writing our book.
Our goal with all
of this is to begin filling a hiatus on the educational literature market that
gets down to the bone and marrow of the badly needed paradigm shift that in
turn will allow for carrying out the new thoughts into practice. This book we
are about to write is not going to list dozens of pages of literary references,
neither will it be fragmented by quotations of other theorists, in fact it will
contain none. We feel like this by itself will be an already refreshing feature
of the book  – that is to dare think
originally. By presenting a new paradigm we intend to deliberate on practical
knowledge that is understandable by just about anyone, yet it digs deep into
the multi-dimensional web of life’s interconnectedness. Readers will be
rewarded by experience and intuition based practical advices, often outrageously
novel. 
In a series of
essays, grouped around more defined topics, we will elaborate on our ideas of a
sustained life – the ”sustainable” world taken further, turning it into
something unconditioned and leaving behind the presumption that it might not
work out. The issue at stake is not about pessimism or optimism, it is not
about expecting the bad or the good, it is not about fearsome or wishful
thinking: it is finally about living intransigently in harmony with nature.

Our topics will
range from ”edible” clothing, zero waste households and businesses, minimum to
no soil disturbance gardening, local food production, communal sharing of goods
and services (such as skills and knowledge), creating new traditions that fit
the locale and the participants’ needs, connecting family education with
schooling of our children, rethinking and remaking their toys to foster wonder
and creativity. We will also touch on the fact that we should not fear death,
but rather embrace it as part of the continuity of life. One might say that any
of these topics have been talked about and that is true. It will be the
approach, the truly novel aspect of writing about them. For example, when we say
edible clothing, we mean it: to not wear anything that you could not ingest
without it being toxic to your body. By zero waste, we mean ZERO waste: in our
world everything we produce can and should be compostable or recyclable without
quality loss. Do not fall for the illusion that Christmas is about love and
family, you know that it is about giving and receiving, in other words it is a
season of gluttonous consumption. Can you refrain from the media induced buying frenzy? 
We encourage
everyone to question EVERYTHING! 
What do you
get?
In exchange for
your support we would love to give back to you some goods that come
from our
organic farm and family heritage. The products we offer as rewards are
all in
line with our sustainability-based thinking and philosophy that will be
put forth
in our book. You will receive the perk corresponding to your
contribution amount, but they are not cumulative. We are not offering
the book as a reward because there are too
many unknown variables in the publishing process, however what we CAN
give is a
SURE promise.
How will your
money be used?
Since we have
moved on the farm we have consciously made efforts and sacrifices to avoid
having to leave the farm for employment, searching for eco-friendly ways to
make a living. Despite the struggle we have found this a precious commitment
worth keeping especially now, having a child who can enjoy the rare benefit of
both parents being at home for her. We intend to use this money for the next
few months’ living expenses – so we can focus on writing, cooking and of course
taking care of our baby. Our expenses consist of food, including the organic
baby foodstuff we feed to our daughter, utilities, bus transportation as well
as room and board for extra WWOOF volunteers to take on ""our” farm work while
we are typing away.  Since we heat and
cook with wood, part of the money will go towards purchasing our winter wood
supply, about 10 cubic meters of black locust.
If we do not
achieve our goal of raising the full sum, the book writing will still go on as
planned, albeit at a slower rate. 
In the case that
we surpass our goal we are buying an organic dairy cow, ready to milk, so that
we can make our own sour cream, sour milk, butter, cheese, cottage cheese,
yogurt and kefir. This would also help us reduce our dependency on mass
produced foods. It  would even provide an
additional small income for our family, that we could sell these dairy products
to our friends and acquaintances.

my name is Emma Dewhurst and I am an actress, independent publisher and mother. I'm also the person
putting this campaign before you today.</p>
<p><span>Five years ago, I found
myself alone again with my beloved daughter, bright with grief and needing to
make a change. For myself, for my community, for my world.</span></p>
<p>I decided to
make a beautiful print magazine called WOW, to share my personal love of the
arts with the community in which I live.</p><p>WOW is an award-winning arts guide to the best of What's On Where, with stunning visuals, high quality articles and regular listings in Film, Music, Theatre and Visual Art. It is much-loved and highly valued by its community of readers, who now number more than 10,000 per monthly issue. </p><p>Here's the e-version of the current magazine: <a href=""http://issuu.com/sue-davis/docs/issuu_nov_2015/1%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;line-height: 24px;font-style: italic;background-color: initial;"">WOW November 2015</a></p><blockquote data-card-key=""a90d2c9d541b43199c7b0657f32d7583""><h4><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">And here are some of our 2015 covers, for which we are (ahem) famed:</span></h4></blockquote>

<p>The money
raised by the campaign is intended to provide WOW with a baseline cashflow over
the course of 2016, which will be in addition to the income from sales
of advertising space. We want to use the year to expand and grow, including employing a part-time media sales person to free Emma up to make the magazine content even better. Also we want to work towards a point where we can pay our contributors for their writing/images.</p>
<p><b>This is a
breakdown in percentages of what we estimate the monies will go towards</b>:</p>
<p>42.5% -
To ensure Emma (75% business partner) can pay herself a living wage and Paul
Baker (25% business partner) is also paid every month of the year. </p>
<p>22% - WOW
Subscriber postage and packing (one year)</p>
<p>16.5% -
Contingency to cover rise in print costs and overheads</p>
<p>12% -
Deficit from producing WOW magazine in 2015</p>
<p>7% -
Campaign fees and Perk fulfilment</p>

<p>This is a ‘Fixed Funding’

refunded to you and we will not be able to go ahead with printing WOW in 2016. </p>
<p>Another risk is that not enough people will renew their subscription at the end of 2016. But we are confident that anyone who receives WOW through their letterbox for one year will want to continue doing so! And if successful we will continue to run a subscription drive during 2016.</p>
<p>Lastly, because the price
of print can fluctuate, we have built into our figures a monthly ‘buffer’, in

Kent Magazine Design of the Year + Highly Commended for Kent Magazine of the Year (Kent Press & Broadcast Awards 2015)

In 2012 Emma Dewhurst was recognised as a 'Community Catalyst' by Ideas Test, a grant-awarding body, by whom she was subsequently awarded a grant of £5000 to develop a new arts site for Kent, wowkent.co.uk

WOW was also awarded one of 100 free places on the School for Creative Start-ups Kent course in 2013.


 Our Resources



An amazing team, both paid and volunteer, who have
been doing the job for five years.


A proven set of skills. We have to date produced 53 quality print magazines


An engaged and committed readership.


A loyal group of regular advertisers.


The ability to give our readers, advertisers and
supporters a sense of ownership, with an invitation to share the journey and
contribute to WOW’s future path.




  Our Target and Your Perks
The money
raised by the campaign is intended to provide WOW with a baseline cashflow over
the course of 2016, which will be in addition to the income from sales
of advertising space. We want to use the year to expand and grow, including employing a part-time media sales person to free Emma up to make the magazine content even better. Also we want to work towards a point where we can pay our contributors for their writing/images.
This is a
breakdown in percentages of what we estimate the monies will go towards:
42.5% -
To ensure Emma (75% business partner) can pay herself a living wage and Paul
Baker (25% business partner) is also paid every month of the year. 
22% - WOW
Subscriber postage and packing (one year)
16.5% -
Contingency to cover rise in print costs and overheads
12% -
Deficit from producing WOW magazine in 2015
7% -
Campaign fees and Perk fulfilment
Perks: Take a look at the sidebar to see the fantastic number of Perks available
to contributors to the campaign!
Here's a look at the glorious 'Story of WOW' by comic illustrator Mark Barnes.

sure you look out for our updates.

  The Impact of your Contribution…
… will be
vast! The great thing about the success of this campaign is that WOW will
remain in the community for all. As well as the print copies sent to WOW
subscribers each month, we will still be able to print pick-up copies for those
who are unable to subscribe.

  What other people say about the value of WOW:
“[WOW]… has been key in supporting the growth of arts in the
area and does so with love and passion on very small margins…” Jane Pitt, multi-disciplinary artist
[WOW has] been a must-read publication in our
house since it was first available and pretty much governs how our free time is
spent. Malcolm Wright, designer

  Our Risks and Challenges

This is a ‘Fixed Funding’
campaign, which means that if we do not reach our target, your money will be
refunded to you and we will not be able to go ahead with printing WOW in 2016. 
Another risk is that not enough people will renew their subscription at the end of 2016. But we are confident that anyone who receives WOW through their letterbox for one year will want to continue doing so! And if successful we will continue to run a subscription drive during 2016.
Lastly, because the price
of print can fluctuate, we have built into our figures a monthly ‘buffer’, in
case there is a sudden rise, so that we can guarantee we can print the magazine
all year.
  Everyone can help by sharing the campaign! Thank you x",15.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Mi nombre es Álex de Sande y soy profesor de un instituto de secundaria.
Cuando fallecieron mis padres realicé el Camino de Santiago para encontrarme a
mí mismo. Luego tuve la necesidad de regresar a mis orígenes, a mi pueblo
natal: Graus (Huesca). A las afueras de la población me adentré por unos caminos que me condujeron hasta el Valle de La
Fueva, un lugar de bosques mágicos, donde descubrí el Monasterio Budista de DSK
de Panillo. Allí realicé diferentes cursos de meditación durante un verano y pude conocer a personas fascinantes que huyendo de su adversa realidad, despertaron
la consciencia del ser e iniciaron un proceso de trasformación de sus
vidas. </p>
<p>Fui testigo de una cautivadora historia de amor que
decidí novelar. En la obra se suceden personajes que irán desvelando sus
pasados llenos de aventuras por medio mundo. Así se suceden las peripecias de
un artista ciego que pinta sueños, un monje que parece levitar, las aventuras
de una esposa atrapada en la lujuria, un cartomántico invidente que a través
de su tarot ve el futuro y un tatuador de lotos azules invisibles, entre muchos
otros. Los protagonistas son una mujer maltratada que quiere cambiar de vida y
un profesor de yoga, que también es oftalmólogo, y que enseña a sus alumnos la
forma de ver con los ojos del corazón.  </p>
<p>El relato destila mucha luz, poesía y espiritualidad.
Sin embargo, en bastantes capítulos la ironía y el humor han conseguido
arrancar carcajadas contagiosas a los amigos que ya la han leído. Eso me
complace, porque sé que la risa lleva a la alegría, y ésta, a la felicidad.</p>
<h3><u>PROYECTO</u></h3>
<p>La novela consta de 555 páginas DIN A-4, por lo que tras el
proceso de maquetación puede aumentar la extensión de la obra.  Mi
objetivo es financiar la publicación del libro en versión digital y unos
quinientos ejemplares en papel para entregarlos a los colaboradores (mecenas) y
distribuirlos entre los medios de comunicación y librerías. </p>
<p>Todos los amigos o mecenas aparecerán en la página web que la
editorial piensa diseñar para promocionar la novela, pero en diferentes
niveles, denominados chacras, en función de las aportaciones realizadas. Las
personas que opten por obtener como recompensa un libro en formato papel,
figurarán en la página de agradecimientos al final de la obra.</p>
<p>Me encantaría que la gente que no pueda colaborar, visitasen la
página de Facebook: QUIERO TOMAR REFUGIO EN TU CORAZÓN, en la que figura el
enlace con Indiegogo, y así podrían promocionar la novela entre sus contactos
al colocarla en su biografía de Facebook. </p>
<h3><u>AGRADECIMIENTOS</u></h3>
<p>Podría
escribir otro libro de gratitud a tanta gente que con su ayuda indirecta y su
influencia inconsciente han hecho realidad esta obra. Creo que los sueños se
cumplen cuando tu ilusión desbordante contagia de entusiasmo a los demás. </p>
<p>Nunca
olvidaré a mi padre por su apoyo discreto, por estar ahí siempre, por su enorme
bondad. Ahora en esa otra dimensión espiritual en que percibo la presencia de
su ausencia, le agradezco que hubiese insistido tanto en que acabará de una vez
las muchas novelas que tenía empezadas. Recuerdo que me dijo con ironía si
escribía en esta vida para publicar en la otra. Y quizá tenía razón.  Te quiero mucho y espero que me perdones por
habértelo dicho poco. </p>
<p>Quiero
agradecer a mi madre, desde lo más profundo de mi corazón, de que me diese la
vida, la mía y la suya, por haberme trasmitido su pasión por la literatura, por
haberse entregado en cuerpo y alma a sus hijos, por apoyarme tanto y haberle
devuelto tan poco. Sé que me ayudas a no desfallecer desde el otro mundo. Te
quiero tanto como te añoro. Necesitaré muchas vidas para compensarte.  </p>
<p>Me
gustaría recordar a mi hermano Pedro, que vivió poco para morir deprisa, por
haber velado mis sueños e iluminado mis duermevelas, enseñándome a escribir a
oscuras y con los ojos cerrados, para ver hacia dentro y expresar hacia fuera
los sentimientos que se refugian en el interior, emociones de luz y de
sombra.  </p>
<p>Debo
reconocer a mi hermano Félix el apoyo psicológico que me ha brindado en los
momentos difíciles, y por estar ahí, como buen terapeuta Gestalt, para
enseñarme a tener la confianza necesaria para superar las adversidades.</p>
<p>  Quiero manifestar mi entrañable gratitud por la
amabilidad y el afecto de todas las personas del Centro Budista Dag Shang Kagyü
en Panillo, cerca de Graus, provincia de Huesca. Lugar donde conocí al monje
Karma Tenpa, una persona iluminada en la humildad, que me trasmitió en sus
cursos de meditación budista la manera de entrenar la mente para despertar la
compasión. Espero la benevolencia de todos los que hice protagonistas de
algunos capítulos sin saberlo, y las disculpas de los que sin pretenderlo, me
olvidé.</p>
<p>Por
último, agradecer a Chelo Lázaro Prieto, maravillosa
profesora de yoga y meditación, todo su cariño y amor. </p><p><b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><i>(P. D.1.Consciente de mi fragilidad, de mis dudas, de

<p><b><u>INICIO DE LA OBRA</u></b></p>
<p><b><u>Capítulo - 1  </u></b></p>
<p>De
repente, ella se despertó con la angustia de ahogarse en un mar de sueños
náufragos, y con la respiración acelerada se dio cuenta de que estaba hiperventilando.
Empezó a aplicar las técnicas de relajación que había aprendido en las sesiones
preparatorias al parto. Apenas había descansado unas horas por el disgusto de
saber que la academia en la que trabajaba había cerrado sin previo aviso.
Llevaba meses sin cobrar, pero tenía la esperanza de que algo le ingresaran.
Esa ansiedad la empujaba a ir al cajero automático del banco hasta diez veces
en un día. Al reclamar, siempre le daban nuevas excusas y le pedían más paciencia.
Tenía la sensación de estar hundiéndose en la adversidad sin ninguna esperanza.</p>
<p>El
divorcio fue una liberación. No iba a consentir nunca más las humillaciones ni
los maltratos físicos ni psicológicos de ningún hombre. Con dignidad iba a
criar a su hija sin tener que arrastrarse ante nadie. Por eso, debía sacar
fuerzas de flaqueza para resistir y continuar luchando sin desfallecer. </p>
<p>Las
paredes de la habitación y del resto del piso estaban pintadas de color gris a
gusto de su exmarido. Ahora le parecían tan asfixiantes como los muros de una
cárcel y quizá lo eran, porque se sentía prisionera de una realidad agobiante
que no le dejaba salir. Por eso, había empezado a empapelarlas con folios en
blanco, como si fueran ventanitas en las que escribía frases que le ayudaban a
levantar el ánimo y a desahogarse, porque sabía que el rencor y el odio que se
acumula dentro acaba carcomiendo el alma. Volvió a leer sus palabras con el
coraje, el dolor y la rabia de las mujeres que nunca se rinden antes de la
batalla:</p>
<p><b>“Hay personas que empiezan a
morir en vida. Otras están muertas y aún no lo saben.  La putrefacción es sutil y rauda. Algunos, al
sentir el olor a cadaverina se embalsaman, pero ya es tarde, pues empiezan a
pudrirse por dentro, siendo el corazón lo primero que devoran los gusanos”.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Tumbada
en la cama, pensó que desde pequeña había confiado en el poder de los
sentimientos y la capacidad de las palabras para atraparlos. Ahora se refugiaba
en la lectura para evadirse de la realidad al sumergirse en otras historias, la
mayoría de superación personal para aprender como las protagonistas se
enfrentaban a la fatalidad y sabían convertir la debilidad en virtud y fortaleza.</p>
<p>El
timbre de la puerta sonó de manera insistente: “¡Ding, dong!, ¡Ding, dong!, ¡Ding,
dong!...” Ella sabía, por su forma impaciente de llamar, que era él. Respiró
profundamente, se puso la bata y con serenidad se levantó. No iba a correr a
abrirle como antes, porque tampoco eran horas para que fuera a visitarla. La
última vez que sucedió algo parecido, se puso tan nerviosa que al apresurarse
se tropezó con el calefactor y se rompió un brazo. En ese momento, el sonido
del timbre se complementó con una batería de golpes en la puerta que iban <i>in crescendo</i>: “¡Toc, toc, toc...! ¡Pum, pum,
pum, pum...! ¡Pam, pam, pam, pam, pam...!” Y su voz grave empezó a sentirse
desde el rellano a medida que arremetía con más furia: — ¡Abre, abre, que sé
que estás ahí! ¡Abre, guarra, o tiro la puerta abajo! ¡Seguro que te he pillado
con alguno en la cama! ¡Cómo le coja le parto las piernas o le capo en vivo! </p>
<p>Ella
se estremeció y con las manos temblorosas empezó a quitar los cerrojos con
miedo y torpeza. Cuando fue a abrir, él invistió la puerta con tanta bravura,
igual que un toro entrando en la plaza, que se la llevó por delante de un
empujón. Lucía, que era menuda, voló por el aire hasta caer de espaldas sobre
la mesita que había enfrente del sofá, y un estrepitoso ruido de cristales
rotos se oyó en el edificio entero. Los gatos huyeron y algunos vecinos
atrapados en la cobardía bajaron las persianas, mientras cerraban las ventanas
a cal y canto. Otros quitaron el volumen del televisor para escuchar la
discusión que se presagiaba. No era la primera vez ni quizá iba a ser la
última. </p>
<p><b><u>Capítulo - 51</u></b></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">  Regresaron al albergue en el coche de Blanca y se
despidieron de ella con un cariñoso abrazo, agradeciéndole la amabilidad que
había tenido en invitarles a cenar y en acompañarles hasta allí. Antes de
marchar, se intercambiaron los números de teléfono, la dirección de correo
electrónico y quedaron para verse más adelante. Ella manifestó qué deseaba que
le diera consejo sobre que práctica de yoga y meditación profundizar para
mejorar la concentración en los estudios. También quería que le informase sobre
nuevos talleres y seminarios que se iban a celebrar los próximos fines de
semana, pues quería asistir con sus amigas, pues la mayoría, cuando llegaba la
época de exámenes, estaban al borde de un ataque de nervios.</span><br/></p>
<p>Como
era muy tarde, Max invitó a Lucía a su casa. Y le dijo: — Ahora si subes
despertarás a todos. Es mejor que vengas a mi refugio secreto. Nunca nadie ha
estado antes. Has visto que excusa tan buena tengo para llevarte al bosque
donde los lobos se comen a las caperucitas azules como tú.</p>
<p>— ¡Qué malo que eres...!
¡Jajajaja...! ¡Sí, me has convencido! — encendieron las linternas y
emprendieron el camino de Ejep. Apenas recorrieron medio kilómetro de pista de
gravilla, que se internaron por un sendero de pinos y maleza. Hasta que él la
detuvo y sobre un tronco ladeado la besó, y le dijo que esperasen hasta
habituar los ojos a la oscuridad, pues era preferible continuar iluminados con
la luz de la luna. Diez minutos más tarde, tras atravesar una espesa cortina de
árboles, de repente apareció una casita de cuento de hadas. Ella no pudo
resistir la fascinación que le produjo y exclamó: — ¡Es mágica...! ¡Está
envuelta en una nube de luz azul fosforescente!</p>
<p>  Al acercarse, él le explicó que la barraca estaba apoyada
sobre una pared de roca en forma de concha, que daba acceso a una gruta donde
habitaban miles de coleópteros. Cogidos de la mano, la guio adentrándose en la
cueva. Los ojos se fueron adaptando a la oscuridad a medida que la rodobsina estimulaba
el nervio óptico. Ambos se detuvieron en el silencio. Entre ellos solo se
intuían por la respiración. El nictálope de Max animó a Lucía a que levantase
la vista. Entonces, ambos contemplaron fascinados un espectáculo maravilloso:
la cúpula del techo de la caverna se había convertido en la inmensa bóveda del
cielo, donde un enjambre de millones de estrellas no paraba de parpadear. Él,
entre bisbiseos, le explicó: <i>“Lo que
estás viendo es una colonia de luciérnagas, la mayoría son larvas y hembras, que
no utilizan la bioluminiscencia de reclamo sexual, sino como cebo. El espectro
de luz que emiten, cada seis a ocho segundos, va de un débil a un intenso azul
y les sirve para atraer en este caso a las presas. Hacen igual que las arañas:
tejen redes invisibles y hebras pegajosas que despliegan desde el techo como si
fuese un caladero, con las mismas técnicas de los viejos pescadores nocturnos;
a continuación, encienden sus linternas biológicas y emiten destellos
intermitentes que atrae a los incautos insectos, los cuales se acercan
encandilados por el mágico brillo y el titilante reclamo, hasta que caen
enredados en la trampa, igual que muchos mortales ante la belleza. Las víctimas
atrapadas intentan escapar, se revuelven y la vibración de las terminaciones
nerviosas de la tela avisa a las depredadoras de que alguna alelada polilla o
mosquito ha vuelto a caer; es el momento en que izan con cuidado las mallas y
los aparejos, algunos de palangre, recogen las capturas y se las comen. Por</i>
<i>eso, alguien, en un rapto de inspiración
poética las bautizó con el singular nombre de “Las estrellas de la muerte.”</i></p>
<p>Durante veinte minutos observaron extasiados aquel
centelleo hipnótico. Estaban ante un espectáculo único. Lucía, con suma
curiosidad, le preguntó en un susurro: — <i>¿Y
cómo sus cuerpos consiguen generar ese resplandor?</i></p>
<p>La respuesta de Max no se hizo esperar y le musitó al
oído: — <i>La bioluminiscencia es un proceso
químico de oxidación del sustrato de la proteína denominada luciferina,
catalizada por la enzima luciferasa. A ellas se les ilumina el abdomen, y como
su piel está recubierta con una especie de lentes conocidas con el nombre de
cristales de urato, intensifican y multiplican el reflejo de la luz.</i></p>
<p>A ella se le ocurrió quitarse la camiseta y dejar al
descubierto su espalda, y sobre la piel desnuda empezó a iluminarse el dibujo
tatuado del loto azul invisible. Max le recorrió a besos el tallo de la flor
hasta llegar a los pétalos detrás de la nuca, mientras sus dedos le masajeaban
cada uno de sus siete chacras. La abrazó por detrás y le hizo el amor en
silencio. El eco de un profundo gemido de placer recorrió los huecos de roca de
la bóveda celeste e hizo temblar las estrellas de aquel inmenso cielo
interior.</p>
<p>Salieron con lentitud de aquel viaje onírico. Max la llevó
de la mano hasta su refugio. Entraron a oscuras. Ella se dio cuenta de que el
tejado tenía dos amplías ventanas en el techo, de tal manera que la luz de la
luna iluminaba el interior de la estancia. Subieron por una escalerilla a un
altillo en donde estaba la cama. Agacharon la cabeza para no darse con las
vigas de madera y se metieron entre las sábanas. En la penumbra, él pudo
vislumbrar por el brillo de sus pupilas el centelleo estelar de la cueva. Se
abrazaron y se llenaron la piel de besos y caricias hasta quedarse dormidos el
uno en el otro.</p>
<p>A medianoche, ella vio como Max se ladeaba, cogía una
libreta y completamente inspirado escribía algo. Estuvo un buen rato alumbrado
por el resplandor lunar. Todavía hipnotizada, observó el movimiento de su mano
atrapada en la caligrafía. Había sido un día inolvidable y una noche llena de
magia y de fantasía. </p>
<p>  Antes de desvanecerse la oscuridad, Lucía se desveló y
vio tumbado a los pies el cuaderno en el que él había anotado algo. En la portada,
de tapa dura, destacaba el título: “Diario del Alma”. De la solapa colgaba la
pluma que le regaló. No pudo vencer su vehemente curiosidad y con sigilo se
movió para intentar coger el cuaderno sin que se diera cuenta. Debía deslizarse
entre las sábanas con lentitud para no despertarle. Tampoco podía demorarse
demasiado, porque no debía faltar mucho para que amaneciera. Con cuidado fue
alargando el brazo hasta cogerlo con el temor de que no se le resbalase de golpe.
Cautelosa lo abrió y vio que las páginas estaban en blanco. Enseguida, se dio
cuenta de que habían sido escritas con su pluma de tinta invisible. Sacó de su
bolso una linternita de luz ultravioleta, que solía utilizar para revisar las
palabras ocultas que utilizaba para atrapar los deseos que ella antes anotaba,
y leyó de la última hoja el párrafo final:</p>
<p>  <b>“La visita con ella
a la gruta fue perturbadora, pues nunca había estado dentro con alguien. Fue
como ir por primera vez. Hacía años que no entraba. A nadie le había revelado
aquel lugar secreto. Me ha evocado lejanos recuerdos de la infancia, cuando me
escapaba de aventuras por las cuevas de la Virgen de La Peña en Graus. A medida
que avanzábamos hacia la oscuridad, esta se hacía más densa, tangible y
misteriosa. Nos detuvimos en la enorme bóveda y tuve la sensación de estar en
el interior de un útero excavado en las entrañas de la tierra, donde una
luminosidad extraña, biológica, emitida principalmente por los cuerpos de miles
de luciérnagas hembras, apareadas en época de reproducción y que albergaban en
sus entrañas docenas de huevos de nuevas crías, inundaban la atmósfera de una
lucífera metamorfosis. Por las paredes del techo del cielo corría la savia
azul de las estrellas, tan embrionaria y emergente que se colaba por las venas
pétreas de la caverna hasta hacerla latir en una continua gestación, a la
espera de que las miles de vidas que llevaban las rocas dentro despertasen de
su sueño mineral, igual que nosotros.”</b></p>

enseñarme a tener la confianza necesaria para superar las adversidades.
  Quiero manifestar mi entrañable gratitud por la
amabilidad y el afecto de todas las personas del Centro Budista Dag Shang Kagyü
en Panillo, cerca de Graus, provincia de Huesca. Lugar donde conocí al monje
Karma Tenpa, una persona iluminada en la humildad, que me trasmitió en sus
cursos de meditación budista la manera de entrenar la mente para despertar la
compasión. Espero la benevolencia de todos los que hice protagonistas de
algunos capítulos sin saberlo, y las disculpas de los que sin pretenderlo, me
olvidé.
Por
último, agradecer a Chelo Lázaro Prieto, maravillosa
profesora de yoga y meditación, todo su cariño y amor. (P. D.1.Consciente de mi fragilidad, de mis dudas, de
mis angustias, debo bendecir a Buda por haberme iluminado este camino y a Dios,
por haberme dado fuerzas para recorrerlo)

(P. D.2. Me gustaría
compartir la mitad de los beneficios de esta obra con la Fundación de Dag Shang
Kagyü. Cáritas. Stop Ceguera. Creciendo en Nepal. Fundación Vicente Ferrer) 

INICIO DE LA OBRA
Capítulo - 1  
De
repente, ella se despertó con la angustia de ahogarse en un mar de sueños
náufragos, y con la respiración acelerada se dio cuenta de que estaba hiperventilando.
Empezó a aplicar las técnicas de relajación que había aprendido en las sesiones
preparatorias al parto. Apenas había descansado unas horas por el disgusto de
saber que la academia en la que trabajaba había cerrado sin previo aviso.
Llevaba meses sin cobrar, pero tenía la esperanza de que algo le ingresaran.
Esa ansiedad la empujaba a ir al cajero automático del banco hasta diez veces
en un día. Al reclamar, siempre le daban nuevas excusas y le pedían más paciencia.
Tenía la sensación de estar hundiéndose en la adversidad sin ninguna esperanza.
El
divorcio fue una liberación. No iba a consentir nunca más las humillaciones ni
los maltratos físicos ni psicológicos de ningún hombre. Con dignidad iba a
criar a su hija sin tener que arrastrarse ante nadie. Por eso, debía sacar
fuerzas de flaqueza para resistir y continuar luchando sin desfallecer. 
Las
paredes de la habitación y del resto del piso estaban pintadas de color gris a
gusto de su exmarido. Ahora le parecían tan asfixiantes como los muros de una
cárcel y quizá lo eran, porque se sentía prisionera de una realidad agobiante
que no le dejaba salir. Por eso, había empezado a empapelarlas con folios en
blanco, como si fueran ventanitas en las que escribía frases que le ayudaban a
levantar el ánimo y a desahogarse, porque sabía que el rencor y el odio que se
acumula dentro acaba carcomiendo el alma. Volvió a leer sus palabras con el
coraje, el dolor y la rabia de las mujeres que nunca se rinden antes de la
batalla:
“Hay personas que empiezan a
morir en vida. Otras están muertas y aún no lo saben.  La putrefacción es sutil y rauda. Algunos, al
sentir el olor a cadaverina se embalsaman, pero ya es tarde, pues empiezan a
pudrirse por dentro, siendo el corazón lo primero que devoran los gusanos”.

Tumbada
en la cama, pensó que desde pequeña había confiado en el poder de los
sentimientos y la capacidad de las palabras para atraparlos. Ahora se refugiaba
en la lectura para evadirse de la realidad al sumergirse en otras historias, la
mayoría de superación personal para aprender como las protagonistas se
enfrentaban a la fatalidad y sabían convertir la debilidad en virtud y fortaleza.
El
timbre de la puerta sonó de manera insistente: “¡Ding, dong!, ¡Ding, dong!, ¡Ding,
dong!...” Ella sabía, por su forma impaciente de llamar, que era él. Respiró
profundamente, se puso la bata y con serenidad se levantó. No iba a correr a
abrirle como antes, porque tampoco eran horas para que fuera a visitarla. La
última vez que sucedió algo parecido, se puso tan nerviosa que al apresurarse
se tropezó con el calefactor y se rompió un brazo. En ese momento, el sonido
del timbre se complementó con una batería de golpes en la puerta que iban in crescendo: “¡Toc, toc, toc...! ¡Pum, pum,
pum, pum...! ¡Pam, pam, pam, pam, pam...!” Y su voz grave empezó a sentirse
desde el rellano a medida que arremetía con más furia: — ¡Abre, abre, que sé
que estás ahí! ¡Abre, guarra, o tiro la puerta abajo! ¡Seguro que te he pillado
con alguno en la cama! ¡Cómo le coja le parto las piernas o le capo en vivo! 
Ella
se estremeció y con las manos temblorosas empezó a quitar los cerrojos con
miedo y torpeza. Cuando fue a abrir, él invistió la puerta con tanta bravura,
igual que un toro entrando en la plaza, que se la llevó por delante de un
empujón. Lucía, que era menuda, voló por el aire hasta caer de espaldas sobre
la mesita que había enfrente del sofá, y un estrepitoso ruido de cristales
rotos se oyó en el edificio entero. Los gatos huyeron y algunos vecinos
atrapados en la cobardía bajaron las persianas, mientras cerraban las ventanas
a cal y canto. Otros quitaron el volumen del televisor para escuchar la
discusión que se presagiaba. No era la primera vez ni quizá iba a ser la
última. 
Capítulo - 51
  Regresaron al albergue en el coche de Blanca y se
despidieron de ella con un cariñoso abrazo, agradeciéndole la amabilidad que
había tenido en invitarles a cenar y en acompañarles hasta allí. Antes de
marchar, se intercambiaron los números de teléfono, la dirección de correo
electrónico y quedaron para verse más adelante. Ella manifestó qué deseaba que
le diera consejo sobre que práctica de yoga y meditación profundizar para
mejorar la concentración en los estudios. También quería que le informase sobre
nuevos talleres y seminarios que se iban a celebrar los próximos fines de
semana, pues quería asistir con sus amigas, pues la mayoría, cuando llegaba la
época de exámenes, estaban al borde de un ataque de nervios.
Como
era muy tarde, Max invitó a Lucía a su casa. Y le dijo: — Ahora si subes
despertarás a todos. Es mejor que vengas a mi refugio secreto. Nunca nadie ha
estado antes. Has visto que excusa tan buena tengo para llevarte al bosque
donde los lobos se comen a las caperucitas azules como tú.
— ¡Qué malo que eres...!
¡Jajajaja...! ¡Sí, me has convencido! — encendieron las linternas y
emprendieron el camino de Ejep. Apenas recorrieron medio kilómetro de pista de
gravilla, que se internaron por un sendero de pinos y maleza. Hasta que él la
detuvo y sobre un tronco ladeado la besó, y le dijo que esperasen hasta
habituar los ojos a la oscuridad, pues era preferible continuar iluminados con
la luz de la luna. Diez minutos más tarde, tras atravesar una espesa cortina de
árboles, de repente apareció una casita de cuento de hadas. Ella no pudo
resistir la fascinación que le produjo y exclamó: — ¡Es mágica...! ¡Está
envuelta en una nube de luz azul fosforescente!
  Al acercarse, él le explicó que la barraca estaba apoyada
sobre una pared de roca en forma de concha, que daba acceso a una gruta donde
habitaban miles de coleópteros. Cogidos de la mano, la guio adentrándose en la
cueva. Los ojos se fueron adaptando a la oscuridad a medida que la rodobsina estimulaba
el nervio óptico. Ambos se detuvieron en el silencio. Entre ellos solo se
intuían por la respiración. El nictálope de Max animó a Lucía a que levantase
la vista. Entonces, ambos contemplaron fascinados un espectáculo maravilloso:
la cúpula del techo de la caverna se había convertido en la inmensa bóveda del
cielo, donde un enjambre de millones de estrellas no paraba de parpadear. Él,
entre bisbiseos, le explicó: “Lo que
estás viendo es una colonia de luciérnagas, la mayoría son larvas y hembras, que
no utilizan la bioluminiscencia de reclamo sexual, sino como cebo. El espectro
de luz que emiten, cada seis a ocho segundos, va de un débil a un intenso azul
y les sirve para atraer en este caso a las presas. Hacen igual que las arañas:
tejen redes invisibles y hebras pegajosas que despliegan desde el techo como si
fuese un caladero, con las mismas técnicas de los viejos pescadores nocturnos;
a continuación, encienden sus linternas biológicas y emiten destellos
intermitentes que atrae a los incautos insectos, los cuales se acercan
encandilados por el mágico brillo y el titilante reclamo, hasta que caen
enredados en la trampa, igual que muchos mortales ante la belleza. Las víctimas
atrapadas intentan escapar, se revuelven y la vibración de las terminaciones
nerviosas de la tela avisa a las depredadoras de que alguna alelada polilla o
mosquito ha vuelto a caer; es el momento en que izan con cuidado las mallas y
los aparejos, algunos de palangre, recogen las capturas y se las comen. Por
eso, alguien, en un rapto de inspiración
poética las bautizó con el singular nombre de “Las estrellas de la muerte.”
Durante veinte minutos observaron extasiados aquel
centelleo hipnótico. Estaban ante un espectáculo único. Lucía, con suma
curiosidad, le preguntó en un susurro: — ¿Y
cómo sus cuerpos consiguen generar ese resplandor?
La respuesta de Max no se hizo esperar y le musitó al
oído: — La bioluminiscencia es un proceso
químico de oxidación del sustrato de la proteína denominada luciferina,
catalizada por la enzima luciferasa. A ellas se les ilumina el abdomen, y como
su piel está recubierta con una especie de lentes conocidas con el nombre de
cristales de urato, intensifican y multiplican el reflejo de la luz.
A ella se le ocurrió quitarse la camiseta y dejar al
descubierto su espalda, y sobre la piel desnuda empezó a iluminarse el dibujo
tatuado del loto azul invisible. Max le recorrió a besos el tallo de la flor
hasta llegar a los pétalos detrás de la nuca, mientras sus dedos le masajeaban
cada uno de sus siete chacras. La abrazó por detrás y le hizo el amor en
silencio. El eco de un profundo gemido de placer recorrió los huecos de roca de
la bóveda celeste e hizo temblar las estrellas de aquel inmenso cielo
interior.
Salieron con lentitud de aquel viaje onírico. Max la llevó
de la mano hasta su refugio. Entraron a oscuras. Ella se dio cuenta de que el
tejado tenía dos amplías ventanas en el techo, de tal manera que la luz de la
luna iluminaba el interior de la estancia. Subieron por una escalerilla a un
altillo en donde estaba la cama. Agacharon la cabeza para no darse con las
vigas de madera y se metieron entre las sábanas. En la penumbra, él pudo
vislumbrar por el brillo de sus pupilas el centelleo estelar de la cueva. Se
abrazaron y se llenaron la piel de besos y caricias hasta quedarse dormidos el
uno en el otro.
A medianoche, ella vio como Max se ladeaba, cogía una
libreta y completamente inspirado escribía algo. Estuvo un buen rato alumbrado
por el resplandor lunar. Todavía hipnotizada, observó el movimiento de su mano
atrapada en la caligrafía. Había sido un día inolvidable y una noche llena de
magia y de fantasía. 
  Antes de desvanecerse la oscuridad, Lucía se desveló y
vio tumbado a los pies el cuaderno en el que él había anotado algo. En la portada,
de tapa dura, destacaba el título: “Diario del Alma”. De la solapa colgaba la
pluma que le regaló. No pudo vencer su vehemente curiosidad y con sigilo se
movió para intentar coger el cuaderno sin que se diera cuenta. Debía deslizarse
entre las sábanas con lentitud para no despertarle. Tampoco podía demorarse
demasiado, porque no debía faltar mucho para que amaneciera. Con cuidado fue
alargando el brazo hasta cogerlo con el temor de que no se le resbalase de golpe.
Cautelosa lo abrió y vio que las páginas estaban en blanco. Enseguida, se dio
cuenta de que habían sido escritas con su pluma de tinta invisible. Sacó de su
bolso una linternita de luz ultravioleta, que solía utilizar para revisar las
palabras ocultas que utilizaba para atrapar los deseos que ella antes anotaba,
y leyó de la última hoja el párrafo final:
  “La visita con ella
a la gruta fue perturbadora, pues nunca había estado dentro con alguien. Fue
como ir por primera vez. Hacía años que no entraba. A nadie le había revelado
aquel lugar secreto. Me ha evocado lejanos recuerdos de la infancia, cuando me
escapaba de aventuras por las cuevas de la Virgen de La Peña en Graus. A medida
que avanzábamos hacia la oscuridad, esta se hacía más densa, tangible y
misteriosa. Nos detuvimos en la enorme bóveda y tuve la sensación de estar en
el interior de un útero excavado en las entrañas de la tierra, donde una
luminosidad extraña, biológica, emitida principalmente por los cuerpos de miles
de luciérnagas hembras, apareadas en época de reproducción y que albergaban en
sus entrañas docenas de huevos de nuevas crías, inundaban la atmósfera de una
lucífera metamorfosis. Por las paredes del techo del cielo corría la savia
azul de las estrellas, tan embrionaria y emergente que se colaba por las venas
pétreas de la caverna hasta hacerla latir en una continua gestación, a la
espera de que las miles de vidas que llevaban las rocas dentro despertasen de
su sueño mineral, igual que nosotros.”",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hi,
</p>
<p>I'm Anton and I'm a self thought novelist.
</p>
<p>During the day I'm a chef, but once I clock out I spend my time 
plotting and writing. This is how it has been for the last 5 
years, and I hope I'll be able to continue doing that. I am working on 
my craft, keeping to explore and grow not because I want to earn a lot 
of money with it or want to become famous.
</p>
<p>My aim is simply to make people explore and discuss topics they 
normally wouldn't. I want to connect people with each other and with 
themselves via art. In my works I explore different issues in today's 
first world society. I try to raise awareness and recognission to topics
 such as bullying and mobbing in the working environment, punishment for
 showing vulnerability, the loss of true self and disconnection between 
people. Topics that are hard to face and even harder to honestly and 
openly talk about.
</p>
<p>Up until now I was able to completely fund my own projects, education 
and motivate people to participate in the projects free of charge. 
However... during the recent months I've lost my job, and therefore 
facing a hard decision: either I stop creating and sharing my work or 
I'll swallow my pride and ask for help to be able to continue. 
</p>
<p>And I choose the later: I'm asking for your help to be able to 
further develop the projects I'm genuinely passionate about. To be able 
to write, pay bills, transportation, and a bit of 
honorar for my muses, who are working such long hours, pouring all 
their hearts and souls into the projects.
</p>
<p>Thank you for taking your time to read this and even bigger thank you
 if you help me continuing the work. If you have any questions, please 
feel free to write me a message.

My name is Gene.</p><p>The immediate goal and the reason for this IndieGoGo project is to get our first book published and out there for everyone to enjoy.</p><p>My wife Traci and I have been involved with the online trivia world since about 1996-97. We actually met while playing in AOL's daily live chat room trivia games. At the time, she lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and I lived outside of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Long story short about our relationship: We are going on 15 years together -- 10 years married -- and are living in Tulsa. Since we found AOL trivia, we have played thousands of games over the years. I quickly decided to become a trivia host, went through some short training, and became one of AOL's Community Leaders. Once AOL decided to do away with their Community Leader program and essentially destroy hundreds of online groups in the process, my friend Jim and I started our own trivia forum (<a href=""http://www.zonetrivia.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.zonetrivia.com</a>), which is still going strong and approaching its 9th anniversary. We have live AOL chat room trivia games every night of the week. I personally host two of them at the moment. Over the years, we have made many great friends, and our love for all things trivia has grown.</p><p>I am writing a book titled ""6-13: A Friday The 13th Movie Trivia Book."" The main reason it will be first (there are more planned) is because Jason Voorhees was born on Friday, June 13th, 1946. (That is the first bit of trivia in the book!) It just so happens that June 13th this year is Jason's 68th birthday, and is a Friday -- a Friday with a full moon even. When I decided I wanted to do a Friday the 13th trivia book, I went looking for a good release date, saw that Jason's birthday was a Friday again, and decided it was fate and that HAD to be the day. </p><p>You might ask, ""Why a Friday The 13th trivia book?"" It is a very good question. I have a very good answer though. You see, my family first got this cool new thing the last week of July in 1981: cable television. I know this because that following weekend a little thing called MTV premiered (August 1, 1981). I was only 9, about to turn 10 in 2-and-a-half months, but I was up at midnight and excited to be tuned in.</p><p>My memory is a very odd thing. I can tell you with absolute certainty that on the day we got it put in, the very first movie I ever saw on cable television was ""Willy Wonka &amp; The Chocolate Factory,"" which coincidentally is just a few months older than I am. I could also tell you that since my oldest brother was a huge fan of The Who, soon after Wonka went off we watched ""Tommy."" Yet, if you asked me about something from last week, I probably wouldn't remember it.</p><p>Now back to the moral of this story. That following weekend an almost 10 year old little boy had a plan that at the time would scar him for at least a month. I saw that ""Friday The 13th"" was on cable. The plan that was hatched was to turn on the channel it was going to be on and pretend to fall asleep on the couch. Back then I had a bad habit of falling asleep with the TV on, and if someone turned it off while I was asleep I would wake up instantly in a cranky mood. So, I was left to sleep on the couch with the TV on, and the living room light out.</p><p>The movie came on, I watched, was terrified, and after the initial terror wore off of my 9 year old self, I was hooked.</p><p>My best friend at the time, Craig, and I had sleepovers nearly every weekend back then. At some point when we were around 11, we began renting and watching movies every time -- the scarier the better.  We watched everything from the ""Faces of Death"" series of movies to many, many bad horror movies no one has ever heard of. A staple of those nights was the ""Friday The 13th"" movie franchise. I think we must have watched Part 4 about 20 times in 1985. That is probably why it is my favorite of the franchise.</p><p>When you combine that with my aforementioned love of trivia, you have the answer to the question, ""Why a Friday The 13th trivia book?""</p><p></p><p>A Little About the Book:</p><p>The book will have hundreds of trivia questions and facts in it. It will include what I am calling the ""Kill Index."" which includes a list of every kill from every Friday the 13th movie, who killed them, the manner in which the character met their end, and any special notes that might be connected with the kill. For instance, the first kill by Jason wearing the hockey mask, the first kill that didn't involve someone named Voorhees as either the killer or the one being killed, or the first time Jason strangled someone with his bare hands, and much more.</p><p>The reason for this IndieGoGo is to get this book published and into the hands of interested readers. </p><p>Our goal is set to $2,500 because originally we wanted to ""pre-sell"" the modest amount of 100 books to the generous people of IndieGoGo. At the time, that reward was set at $20 per book (about $5 of which was for shipping) -- that is $2,000. The rest was to cover any fees. We have since lowered the contribution that gets the book to $15, so that throws off the totals a bit. But we have a bunch of other great rewards available; check them out below.</p><p>As I said above, the main goal is to get our book in the hands of readers, but the funds raised here will help pay for the cover art we had made, some advertising campaigns we have in place, and hopefully enough to pay for some expanded distribution opportunities. Of course it will also cover the cost of the rewards chosen for your contribution level.</p><p>Our cover art was done by Diogo Lando of Portugal. Please be sure to watch the video to see The Making Of The Cover Art.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FufOfOqZHQZg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DufOfOqZHQZg&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FufOfOqZHQZg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>While trying to figure out the rewards, I started a conversation with Ari Lehman, the First Jason. He has been outstanding! We now have 10 signed photos from him (technically 11, if you count the one for me personally, which can be seen in the Gallery tab above). He will also be signing the 3 replica masks! And most importantly to me, he is writing the Foreword for the book! How cool is it to have the First Jason IN my book!?!</p><p></p><p><b>Announcing Our New Referral Program</b></p><p>We have 14 days left on our IndieGoGo campaign, and a long way to go to reach our goal.

JASON NEVER DIES!!! Ari Lehman/FIRST JASON""Thanks,~GeneBelow is the original IndieGoGo post where you can check out all the artwork and more.--------------------------------------Be sure to check the Updates tab above.Hi. My name is Gene.The immediate goal and the reason for this IndieGoGo project is to get our first book published and out there for everyone to enjoy.My wife Traci and I have been involved with the online trivia world since about 1996-97. We actually met while playing in AOL's daily live chat room trivia games. At the time, she lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and I lived outside of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Long story short about our relationship: We are going on 15 years together -- 10 years married -- and are living in Tulsa. Since we found AOL trivia, we have played thousands of games over the years. I quickly decided to become a trivia host, went through some short training, and became one of AOL's Community Leaders. Once AOL decided to do away with their Community Leader program and essentially destroy hundreds of online groups in the process, my friend Jim and I started our own trivia forum (www.zonetrivia.com), which is still going strong and approaching its 9th anniversary. We have live AOL chat room trivia games every night of the week. I personally host two of them at the moment. Over the years, we have made many great friends, and our love for all things trivia has grown.I am writing a book titled ""6-13: A Friday The 13th Movie Trivia Book."" The main reason it will be first (there are more planned) is because Jason Voorhees was born on Friday, June 13th, 1946. (That is the first bit of trivia in the book!) It just so happens that June 13th this year is Jason's 68th birthday, and is a Friday -- a Friday with a full moon even. When I decided I wanted to do a Friday the 13th trivia book, I went looking for a good release date, saw that Jason's birthday was a Friday again, and decided it was fate and that HAD to be the day. You might ask, ""Why a Friday The 13th trivia book?"" It is a very good question. I have a very good answer though. You see, my family first got this cool new thing the last week of July in 1981: cable television. I know this because that following weekend a little thing called MTV premiered (August 1, 1981). I was only 9, about to turn 10 in 2-and-a-half months, but I was up at midnight and excited to be tuned in.My memory is a very odd thing. I can tell you with absolute certainty that on the day we got it put in, the very first movie I ever saw on cable television was ""Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory,"" which coincidentally is just a few months older than I am. I could also tell you that since my oldest brother was a huge fan of The Who, soon after Wonka went off we watched ""Tommy."" Yet, if you asked me about something from last week, I probably wouldn't remember it.Now back to the moral of this story. That following weekend an almost 10 year old little boy had a plan that at the time would scar him for at least a month. I saw that ""Friday The 13th"" was on cable. The plan that was hatched was to turn on the channel it was going to be on and pretend to fall asleep on the couch. Back then I had a bad habit of falling asleep with the TV on, and if someone turned it off while I was asleep I would wake up instantly in a cranky mood. So, I was left to sleep on the couch with the TV on, and the living room light out.The movie came on, I watched, was terrified, and after the initial terror wore off of my 9 year old self, I was hooked.My best friend at the time, Craig, and I had sleepovers nearly every weekend back then. At some point when we were around 11, we began renting and watching movies every time -- the scarier the better.  We watched everything from the ""Faces of Death"" series of movies to many, many bad horror movies no one has ever heard of. A staple of those nights was the ""Friday The 13th"" movie franchise. I think we must have watched Part 4 about 20 times in 1985. That is probably why it is my favorite of the franchise.When you combine that with my aforementioned love of trivia, you have the answer to the question, ""Why a Friday The 13th trivia book?""A Little About the Book:The book will have hundreds of trivia questions and facts in it. It will include what I am calling the ""Kill Index."" which includes a list of every kill from every Friday the 13th movie, who killed them, the manner in which the character met their end, and any special notes that might be connected with the kill. For instance, the first kill by Jason wearing the hockey mask, the first kill that didn't involve someone named Voorhees as either the killer or the one being killed, or the first time Jason strangled someone with his bare hands, and much more.The reason for this IndieGoGo is to get this book published and into the hands of interested readers. Our goal is set to $2,500 because originally we wanted to ""pre-sell"" the modest amount of 100 books to the generous people of IndieGoGo. At the time, that reward was set at $20 per book (about $5 of which was for shipping) -- that is $2,000. The rest was to cover any fees. We have since lowered the contribution that gets the book to $15, so that throws off the totals a bit. But we have a bunch of other great rewards available; check them out below.As I said above, the main goal is to get our book in the hands of readers, but the funds raised here will help pay for the cover art we had made, some advertising campaigns we have in place, and hopefully enough to pay for some expanded distribution opportunities. Of course it will also cover the cost of the rewards chosen for your contribution level.Our cover art was done by Diogo Lando of Portugal. Please be sure to watch the video to see The Making Of The Cover Art.While trying to figure out the rewards, I started a conversation with Ari Lehman, the First Jason. He has been outstanding! We now have 10 signed photos from him (technically 11, if you count the one for me personally, which can be seen in the Gallery tab above). He will also be signing the 3 replica masks! And most importantly to me, he is writing the Foreword for the book! How cool is it to have the First Jason IN my book!?!Announcing Our New Referral ProgramWe have 14 days left on our IndieGoGo campaign, and a long way to go to reach our goal.

</div><p>Prose in the Park (PiP) is a grassroots literary festival and
book fair organized and curated by English and French writers and publishers
from the National Capital Region.</p>
<p>In 2015, our inaugural festival welcomed 1200 visitors and 150
Canadian writers, publishers, and booksellers to Parkdale Park for a day of
readings, networking, and celebration, making it Ottawa’s favourite open-air
literary festival and book fair.</p>
<p><b>So we are doing it again!</b></p>
<p>Prose in the Park 2016 will take place in Ottawa on June
4 and will bring over 50 Canadian authors, including Heather O’Neill,
Saleema Nawaz, Caroline Pignant and Ian Hamilton, and 2000+ writers, readers,
book lovers, and families once more to Parkdale Park and Ottawa’s vibrant west
end.</p>
<p><b>What is Prose in the Park?</b></p>
<p>Prose in the Park is an initiative of the Ottawa Independent
Writers (OIW), a Canadian federally registered not-for-profit association (federal
registration # 205463-9) that has served the Ottawa writing community for 30
years, A 100%
volunteer-run steering committee representing
the Hintonburg Community Association, the Hintonburg Economic Development
Committee, L’Association des Auteures et Auteurs de l’Ontario Francais (OAAF),
the Capital Crime Writers, The Ottawa Science Fiction and Fantasy Society, the
Ottawa Romance Writers Association, the Ottawa Storytellers and the Canadian
Authors Association – National Capital Region organizes the event, working
together to ensure that the festival represents the excellence and diversity of
Canadian  literary production.</p>
<p><b>Why Prose in the Park?</b></p>
<p>Prose in the Park is unique among literary festivals in that it
provides local emerging authors, award-winning Canadian authors, Anglophone and
Francophone authors, self-published authors, publishers, and local booksellers,
and readers of all genres and interests with the rare opportunity to meet and
engage with each other in a friendly, interactive, and festive environment.</p>
<p>As a grassroots festival organized by and for the local writing
community, Prose in the Park was created in order to provide Ottawa with an
exciting, free, local literary festival that is inclusive, welcoming, and
truly representative of Canada’s rich, diverse literary community. We believe
this festival contributes to the quality of life in Ottawa by providing
opportunities for community members of all ages to gather, participate in their
local literary scene, listen to great stories, meet great storytellers and
support the local literary economy.</p>
<p>In 2015 over 90% of the inaugural festival’s expenses were met thanks to in-kind contributions. The remaining expenses were covered
by financial contributions from local businesses, private donations, the OIW,
and vendor fees.</p>
<p>For the 2016 festival, we are requesting financial contributions
and in-kind donations from local businesses and community members like you. All
donations will be used to pay author travel and speaking fees, cover the costs
of promotional materials (including our website, printed programmes, and
posters) and refreshments for authors and volunteers during the Festival.</p>
<p>And every little bit helps! Even if we don’t meet our Indiegogo

<p>Cronache Ribelli non è soltanto l’appellativo di questo Almanacco, ma anche il nome di un progetto di narrazione storica di cui questa pubblicazione è il primo passo tangibile.</p>
<p>Il nostro obiettivo è creare una realtà che promuova un racconto storico alternativo a quelli classici. Alternativo nei protagonisti: classi popolari, gruppi emarginati e subalterni, diventano gli attori che calcano i nostri palcoscenici scalzando i “grandi” della storia. Alternativo nella narrazione: una prosa dinamica e fluida, coincisa ed emozionale, per fare breccia negli ambienti popolari e per favorire la fruibilità dei contenuti. Alternativo nella costruzione: un progetto orizzontale in cui tutti i partecipanti hanno diritti pari al contributo che possono apportare. Alternativo nella forma: alla prosa si accompagnano innovative costruzioni grafiche e contributi artistici. Alternativo nelle finalità: la narrazione storica come veicolo di emancipazione culturale collettiva.</p>
<p>Per questo crediamo che Cronache Ribelli sia molto di più di questo libro. Speriamo che questa rappresenti solo la prima tappa di un ciclo di avventure editoriali che ci permettano, nel nostro piccolo, di offrire un modo diverso di divulgare la Storia e un modo diverso per cambiare la società che ci circonda. </p>
<p>Un progetto come quello che pensiamo di portare avanti non può che partire dal basso. Per questo abbiamo deciso di lanciare un crowdfunding, virtuale e non, che abbia lo scopo di mettere insieme un piccolo capitale da investire in tre ambiti fondamentali.</p>
<p>Prima di tutto lo sviluppo di un progetto informatico che renda ancora più fruibile l’accesso alle informazioni che col tempo cercheremo di dare. L’idea è quella di creare uno spazio virtuale in cui gran parte del materiale resti gratuito e liberamente condivisibile, e all’interno del quale si possa sviluppare costantemente un dibattito su quali temi affrontare e con quali modalità ampliare la documentazione interna. Uno spazio in cui ai consueti approfondimenti testuali si possano affiancare video e audio, sempre nell’intento di rinnovare la nostra narrazione e nell’ottica di coinvolgere più persone possibili. </p>
<p>In second’ordine, ma non per importanza, vogliamo mettere in piedi un piccolo team che riunisca individualità con varie competenze.

</div></div>","Cronache Ribelli non è soltanto l’appellativo di questo Almanacco, ma anche il nome di un progetto di narrazione storica di cui questa pubblicazione è il primo passo tangibile.
Il nostro obiettivo è creare una realtà che promuova un racconto storico alternativo a quelli classici. Alternativo nei protagonisti: classi popolari, gruppi emarginati e subalterni, diventano gli attori che calcano i nostri palcoscenici scalzando i “grandi” della storia. Alternativo nella narrazione: una prosa dinamica e fluida, coincisa ed emozionale, per fare breccia negli ambienti popolari e per favorire la fruibilità dei contenuti. Alternativo nella costruzione: un progetto orizzontale in cui tutti i partecipanti hanno diritti pari al contributo che possono apportare. Alternativo nella forma: alla prosa si accompagnano innovative costruzioni grafiche e contributi artistici. Alternativo nelle finalità: la narrazione storica come veicolo di emancipazione culturale collettiva.
Per questo crediamo che Cronache Ribelli sia molto di più di questo libro. Speriamo che questa rappresenti solo la prima tappa di un ciclo di avventure editoriali che ci permettano, nel nostro piccolo, di offrire un modo diverso di divulgare la Storia e un modo diverso per cambiare la società che ci circonda. 
Un progetto come quello che pensiamo di portare avanti non può che partire dal basso. Per questo abbiamo deciso di lanciare un crowdfunding, virtuale e non, che abbia lo scopo di mettere insieme un piccolo capitale da investire in tre ambiti fondamentali.
Prima di tutto lo sviluppo di un progetto informatico che renda ancora più fruibile l’accesso alle informazioni che col tempo cercheremo di dare. L’idea è quella di creare uno spazio virtuale in cui gran parte del materiale resti gratuito e liberamente condivisibile, e all’interno del quale si possa sviluppare costantemente un dibattito su quali temi affrontare e con quali modalità ampliare la documentazione interna. Uno spazio in cui ai consueti approfondimenti testuali si possano affiancare video e audio, sempre nell’intento di rinnovare la nostra narrazione e nell’ottica di coinvolgere più persone possibili. 
In second’ordine, ma non per importanza, vogliamo mettere in piedi un piccolo team che riunisca individualità con varie competenze. Innanzitutto storici, magari giovani, e che si occupino di temi abitualmente poco approfonditi. Affiancati da una serie di figure creative, con competenze informatiche e di montaggio video. Con un gruppo di questo tipo intendiamo progettare una o più proposte editoriali, tanto cartacee quanto sul web, che si articolino attraverso percorsi diversificati e in grado di valorizzare le capacità e le inclinazioni di ognuno.
Infine i proventi del crowdfunding serviranno a finanziare gli spostamenti sul territorio indispensabili a far conoscere il progetto Cronache Ribelli e lavorare per la costruzione di quella rete alternativa di distribuzione che sogniamo di creare. Una rete in cui oltre a far circolare materiale storico sarebbe bello inserire tutta una serie di prodotti editoriali alternativi. Una rete che riunisca associazioni di varia natura, gruppi di quartiere, singoli attivisti e molto altro ancora. Una rete in cui si possano trovare spazi di dialogo, confronti aperti e anche momenti di convivialità condivisa.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Ekklesia
is an independent, not-for-profit thinktank which orients its work around the
changing role of beliefs, values and faith/non-faith in public life.  We
have a track record in producing reports and commentary that is both
thought-provoking and transformative.</p>
<p>Our
Indiegogo campaign is to launch our latest project. ""Sexuality, struggle
and saintliness: same sex love and the church"" is a groundbreaking new
book from Ekklesia associate Savitri Hensman. </p>
<p>The author
identifies the differences over same-sex love that have led to
heated arguments and threats of division in churches. Over the past century,
increasing numbers of theologians have come to believe that faithful,
self-giving partnerships are not at odds with biblical teaching, a view now
shared by many churchgoers. Yet others strongly disagree. This book examines
the shift in thinking on sex-uality, delves beneath the surface of some of the
conflicts that have arisen, offers reflections on the Bible and tradition and
their relevance today and explores how churches can, and do, live with
disagreement. It draws on articles which have previously been published on the
Ekklesia web-site but also contains new material and fresh insights.</p>
<p>Ekklesia
is a small think tank operating on limited resources. This Indiegogo campaign
will help fund an important piece of work that we believe will have an
important contribution to the debates on same-sex relationships and the church.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b>:</p>
<p>In order to produce this book we need to raise at
least £600. This will pay for production, designing and editing the work, and
contribute to our publicity and marketing campaign.</p>

<h3>About the Book</h3>
<p>Hi:))  I am Isha Sacheti, a 14 year old student and also the writer and illustrator of “Lily’s wish.” The main character of this story is Lily who is just a seven-year-old girl. Join her on her exclusively solo adventure! Learn about how she manages to find strength in herself and comes to realize that her difference is what makes her perfect.</p>
<p>Basically, the thought of creating a picture came to me when I saw young children not being able to express themselves, just because they could not counter or understand their fears. I have realised that children learn in an environment which they find friendly and conducive. I have tried to showcase Lily’s story as an inspiration for young children, using illustrations and language they find relatable to. Lily is a character which is like every young child. She has aspirations and curiosity like all young children. Her family, her environment and her quest is like every young child’s. </p>
<p>I wish to take my passion of drawing and communicating to a level where I can publish more stories that relate to children’s quests. I wish to make games and tools that children find comfortable and simple. </p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b></p>
<p>Lily's wish is about facing your own fears and overcoming them, a story about confidence and hope despite differences.... It's a story about finding out who you are.</p>
<p>Since this is my first book, I need your help to make this book a reality! It would be wonderful for me to watch this project blossom into a success. I really want to get this book out, and I want you to feel happy with the perks I can give you :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE BOOK</strong></p>
<p>The book has a hard cover and the dimensions are 11.5 by 8 inches. It consists of 32 pages with illustrations and text that will draw the reader into this story.</p>

As hypocrisy begins to run rampant and harassment becomes a part of life, Ashton's inner demons began to manifest into something much larger. To many, ignorance is bliss but as history tends to show, ignorance can leave the world a dark and deviant place.COMING FEBRUARY 3RD, 2017",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Fitness without Fear debunks many of the myths and haphazard approaches that are circling around exercise and health. Our bodies evolved to need exercise, but not the no pain, no gain variety. Proper movement, the foundation of all exercises, is a learned skill, similar to reading or playing an instrument.<br/><br/>My name is Sara Fleming and I am the author of Fitness without Fear: A Practical, Gentle Guide to Improving Your Life Through Good Movement. I wrote this book because throughout my practice in working with high level athletes and average folks from all walks of life, I have learned that the fitness industry’s approach to exercise seems to mainly target the already fit. For the other 60-80 percent of the population, an approach that prioritizes learning skills and good movements that are ideal for the individual is what actually works best. Unfortunately, the dominant, no pain, no gain attitude and approach to fitness, while fun for some, is more often intimidating to others. It is also the source of many preventable training injuries that occur.<br/><br/>In reading this book, my hope is that you will learn how to assess what you need, and what you don’t need, in your exercise program as you build the basic skills key to a healthy and functional life. Fitness is not an either or prospect, and there are many ways to build it into your life over time. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn how to turn your body into the most functional version of itself that suits your lifestyle and enables you to have a long and healthy life without limitations.<br/><br/>Fitness without Fear was written for those who have felt intimidated, disenfranchised, or turned off by the commercial fitness industry. In this book, you will learn what really drives positive physical changes, and how to design your own fit lifestyle.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Fitness without Fear inspires a transformation in how you view the role fitness should play in your life. In this book you will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>No pain, no gain is a dangerous lie.</li>
<li>Movement in general is medicine for our bodies and minds.</li>
<li>Simple strength training is the key to overcoming pain and immobility and is the foundation of athletic ability regardless of age.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">If you want to learn how to practically incorporate effective fitness into your schedule for a healthy and sustainable lifestyle, then this book is for you.</span></p>I look forward to pulling back the curtain on fitness and empowering my readers to make big impacts on their health through small but powerful changes in their lives.<br/> <h3>The Book - Fitness Without Fear</h3> This book is written in 4 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the Introduction as well as Chapter 1: Where do we begin?, Chapter 2: No Pain, No Gain?, and Chapter 3: How to Train Like a Scientist. In this section, I explain the evolutionary and physiological basis of how exercise changes your body. It dives into how and why we need to tune out the voices telling us that intensity is the most important thing, and we begin by taking a look at how you begin to assess your personal journey. The top coaches and athletes in the world do not train the way you think they do. Skill development and practice is what makes most athletes great and having a fitness foundation to build those on is where we start.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 4: Let’s Go For a Walk, Chapter 5: Strength Training: The Art and the Tools, Chapter 6: Power Training and Weighted Carries, and Chapter 8: Building Workouts. In this section we will explore the basics of exercise including why walking is one of the best exercises you can do for both your body and mind, and how basic strength training can free you from pain and immobility. You will learn to design short workouts that deliver big results in health and functionality. If you think you are past your prime, you couldn’t be more wrong. Anyone can start daily routines that promote a healthy and active lifestyle.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains Chapter 9: Staying Motivated, Chapter 10: Achieving Your Goals, and Chapter 11: Success Stories for Inspiration. In this section we talk about how to maintain your motivation and how to write your own programs for long term training goals. This section will also provide some moving and inspirational true life stories. You will even be provided with examples of programs you can use in your own fitness journey. Once you learn how to establish some basic routines as demonstrated in Part II, you can create your own fitness journey and Part III will help guide you along the way.<br/><br/><strong>The Appendix</strong> contains three more sections that you may want to refer to as you are reading the book. The first is a lexicon of gym and fitness terms that you may not be familiar with. The second is an extensive appendix of strength exercises and stretches that you can use to design your workouts and address any flexibility issues you may encounter. Finally, you will learn early on that this book is not about weight loss, but rather, a tool to help you achieve your fitness goals by addressing why diet is the keystone for success in reducing body fat.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3> Sara Fleming has been a personal trainer and a strength and sports coach for over ten years. She has a masters degree in biochemistry from Georgetown University. Prior to her coaching career, she spent ten years in medical research applying scientific methods to numerous problems in the research lab. After she and her husband started their family, she made the transition to personal training and coaching. Her unique approach has brought both her and her clients a great deal of success in competition, wellness, and in life. Coming from a non-athletic background, Sara has used her educational approach to training to learn how to participate and become competitive in a variety of sports and activities, including the Scottish highland games.<br/><br/>Sara has always been passionate about teaching fitness to folks from all walks of life. Many people give up on fitness because its too involved, requires too much effort, and quite frankly, is too intimidating. Sara has never liked that aspect of the fitness industry and every brave soul who has entered her gym has been relieved to find out that her goal is to teach them to have the fit active life they've always wanted. She assists them in creating a plan on their own terms and for their own purposes.<br/><br/>Sara has trained athletes of all ages and levels of competition including national and world level strength athletes. She has learned that the effective and safe training principles that make her athletes successful also apply to her every-day clients. She has trained a diverse group of people from powerlifters with national and world titles, to grandmothers just looking to keep up with their grandkids. The key is to her approach is to train the individual for what they need, and not apply a one size fits all approach.<br/><br/>Sara has three active teenagers and an ER doctor for a husband, so her schedule tends to be a bit hectic. However, she still finds time to go for long walks with her crazy rescue dog, Macy, and bake the occasional pie.<br/><br/>To learn more, you can connect with Sara Fleming at flemingsj4616@gmail.com and at instagram.com/sarafleming_author.<br/> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>What happens when keen insights into U.S. and global progressive politics are mixed with humor and more than a dash of snark?</p>
<p>You get <a href=""http://www.borderlessnewsandviews.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Borderless News and Views (BNV)</a>.</p>
<p>BNV is a news site small enough to feel like a community, but large enough to be covering diverse topics with 25 writers located in over 10 countries. The site publishes several articles a day seven days a week, with the focus on Progressive Politics with a dash of snark. In addition to Politics, we publish stories in the areas of Lifestyle, Technology, Finance, Social Change, and “Art-itorials.”</p>
<p>The tagline for BNV is to Educate, Entertain, and Eradicate Borders.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Educate</span>: This progressive blogazine does more than report mainstream news. We do our homework to educate readers on stories and points of view not typically found with the larger news organizations. Stories about life in Singapore, local Pakistani politics, and first person accounts on the effects of the War on Women are just a few examples.</p>

<p>We are proud of what we have accomplished to date, but we want to do more, which requires funding.

<p>Our talented writers are the heart of our site. Without their diverse, unique perspectives, we would not have such an eclectic mix of reporting.

We would like to compensate our writers and a successful campaign will help us accomplish this important goal.</p>
<p>We also want to increase our reporting to be able to include regular video and audio podcasts to the mix. </p>
<p>While we accept paid advertising, our goal is to also be able to have the ability to leave advertising space for global organizations that seek to bring a positive change to the world such as Doctors without Borders, Playing for Change, One Laptop Per Child, Barefoot College, and various micro lending organizations such as Kiva. Cutting back on paid advertising slots to promote charitable organizations means alternative sources of revenue, such as this campaign.</p>

</div></div>","Who We Are
What happens when keen insights into U.S. and global progressive politics are mixed with humor and more than a dash of snark?
You get Borderless News and Views (BNV).
BNV is a news site small enough to feel like a community, but large enough to be covering diverse topics with 25 writers located in over 10 countries. The site publishes several articles a day seven days a week, with the focus on Progressive Politics with a dash of snark. In addition to Politics, we publish stories in the areas of Lifestyle, Technology, Finance, Social Change, and “Art-itorials.”
The tagline for BNV is to Educate, Entertain, and Eradicate Borders.
Educate: This progressive blogazine does more than report mainstream news. We do our homework to educate readers on stories and points of view not typically found with the larger news organizations. Stories about life in Singapore, local Pakistani politics, and first person accounts on the effects of the War on Women are just a few examples.
Entertain: What could be more humorous than the current U.S. presidential campaign? In our opinion -- not much.
 Eradicate Borders: Whether real or imagined, we work hard to break down the borders in society. We believe that starts with telling the truth. And, while we enjoy snark, we also find a place to bring a message of unity and understanding to our readers. We work hard to accomplish this, which begins with our writers. Our staff is made up of a broad and diverse mix, varying in age, gender, sexual orientation, racial background, and religious beliefs.

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<p>The battle against COVID has worsened in India in a matter of days. There are not enough resources to keep up with demand, not enough hospital beds or oxygen tanks to sustain those falling ill.  I am personally contributing an equal amount of all my book campaign presales for #EmpathyAndArrogance made through the end of the campaign to a trusted organization supporting relief efforts.</p>
<p>My name is Gurmeet Kaur and I am the author of <strong><i>Empathy &amp; Arrogance: The Paradox of Digital Products</i>.</strong> I wrote this book because I noticed teams taking a process and checklist based approach to building digital products. While this approach works to build a short term digital presence, the approach does not set you up to build competitive advantage or succeed and thrive in a Darwinian digital world where it is survival of the digitally fit.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that it takes more than a process or checklist to build products that win over your customers and make them true brand fans. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for building strong connections with your customers and truly humanizing digital. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you change your approach to both thinking and building digital products.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about the evolution of digital products, the need for a different approach as well as the need for both empathy and arrogance to build strong digital products. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>Why established companies such as Kodak, Borders, and Blockbuster failed in their digital efforts</li>
<li>The story of startups as well as popular digital products such as Waze, TikTok, AirBnb and how they used both empathy and arrogance to build their digital products</li>
<li>Why the empowered product manager needs to understand data, along with the traditional product components of business, user experience and technology.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you are a creative thinker and want to challenge your thought process, if you understand that processes are the means to the end but not the end, if you like story-based problem solving, and if you love to build digital products, as much as I do.</p>
<p><br/><i>Empathy &amp; Arrogance: The Paradox of Digital Products</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to everyone who dreams, touches and builds digital products as well as non-digital users who want to understand and look at product mindset and product approach in a new way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Book - <i>Empathy &amp; Arrogance: The Paradox of Digital Products</i></strong><strong> - is written in three parts.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. The first part of the book establishes the foundation for why digital products need a different approach and mindset. Along with learning about digital wars, you will learn how to re-define why you, as a company or team, exist, what customer problem you are trying to solve, and the mindset you need to play the digital game when building digital products.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 4 - 6: Building on the foundational elements, this section focuses on Empathy. You’ll learn why empathy is essential to playing the digital product game. You’ll learn about customer obsession and how companies use the obsession to build products that delight their customers. You’ll also learn about the nuances of global products.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 7-11: We delve deeper into arrogance, and key components of a digital product: user experience, technology, and data, as well as marketing. We explore common pitfalls for each component as well as understand how each component can be used to build competitive advantage of your product.<br/> </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>All Roads Lead to Nowhere is a novel that follows seven important people who are pushed to the edge of desperation through interactions with each other, their environment, and unforeseen forces in an alternate future timeline. China and Russia defeated the United States in a nuclear global conflict, and those who remain must persevere in the devastated areas of Nowhere, finding new conflicts with the lucky few who live in the Paradise Cities. </p>
<p>My name is Alexander Skikos and I am the author of All Roads Lead to Nowhere. I wrote this book in order to provide insight regarding the philosophies that divide us in contemporary times and hopefully educate people through a fun and thrilling story how each paradigm survives in the face of a humanitarian crisis. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the importance of understanding others—thinking about what connects us, and what supposedly divides us.</p>
<p>The book takes place in a post-apocalyptic future America. The U.S. has devolved into a colony for the newly united People’s Republic of Russia and China. In this world, there are two settings: the supposedly beautiful and majestic Paradise Cities, each named after an iconic American metropolis, and what they call Nowhere, the remains of the wasteland that once was the United States. Those stuck in Nowhere are forgotten by those who are not.  <br/><br/>You will love this book if you love:</p>
<ul>
<li>science-fiction thrillers like Blade Runner, Dune, or Watchmen</li>
<li>a page turner that forces you to answer, “Who deserves to have the Good Life?”</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>All Roads Lead to Nowhere speaks to people trying to make sense of our modern political and social strife and those who grapple with what qualities are required for someone to be considered a worthy role model.</p>
<h3><strong>About the Author</strong></h3>
<p>Alexander Skikos has studied Political Science and Communication. He is passionate about a multitude of topics ranging from dinosaurs to discussing Plato’s Republic, with the ultimate goal of understanding how environment impacts the communication techniques used by politicians and media outlets, or vice versa. His hope is for people to hold up a mirror and reflect on how they can improve themselves to live out their desires and fulfill their potential. <br/><br/>Alex is a sports enthusiast, as his favorite teams are the Golden State Warriors, San Francisco Giants, and 49ers. He loves hiking, going to the beach, and enjoys a wide variety of music ranging from Pink Floyd to Kendrick Lamar. <br/><br/>For more information, you can contact Alex at askikos@scu.edu, on Instagram @allroadsleadtonowherebook, and LinkedIn at <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-skikos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-skikos</a>. </p>

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is Blou (which means <em>‘blue’ </em>in Afrikaans) and I'm hoping to bring my story of a shattering stroke and its profound blessing, to life.</p>
<p>Almost seven years ago, a pituitary apoplexy stopped me in my tracks. I was twenty seven, and suddenly my well planned world disintergrated. As it turns out, losing my head helped save my life. And it is this journey, my unconventional tale of transformation, I wish to turn into a book...</p>
<p>Briefly: fear and desire for financial security led me to abandon my creative side in favour of a more logical and reasonable path. After seven arduous years of study and what often felt like soulless work, I qualified as a chartered accountant (US equivalent of a CPA). The one aspect of work I enjoyed, a lighthouse beam through the gloom, was facilitating training – and this created an exciting opportunity to work at KPMG’s Learning and Development global head office in America. Already a workaholic, my life became increasingly unbalanced until the 9<sup>th</sup> of February 2006: I blew my hormonal motherboard. Without a pituitary seamlessly orchestrating my vital hormones, I developed a chronic, life threatening condition. Reality altered radically to say the least.</p>
<p>Forced to resign and return home to Africa, I struggled to accept the massive change this condition wrought. Having always been fiercely independent and physically strong, I was now debilitatingly weak and dependent on help from family and friends. And there were more devastating challenges to face: my disability insurers refused to pay long term benefits; healthcare and medication to manage this rare condition proved expensive and there was no way my body could cope with the stress of my old career.</p>
<p>So began a slow process of surrender as I pieced together a new life. Fundamental changes had to be made and I struggled to find meaning in my radically diminshed life. I invested my carefully squirreled lifesavings into getting well: healing by almost imperceptible increments and gradually developing a new kind of strength. I began working towards my dream of writing by starting a blog (<strong><a href=""http://www.scarletnguni.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ScarletNguni.com</a></strong>) and learning to follow my heart. In April, against medical precedent and to the great surprise of my doctors, tests revealed I was begining to regain some pituitary functionality!</p>
<p>Two months ago, I took another massive leap into the Unknown, finally committing fully to the dream of sharing my story. I moved out into the country, living in a simple cottage without electricity where I can focus on birthing this book. A massive oak tree dominates my view here and inspired another creative project to celebrate cycles and try balance my old dragon - workaholism: <strong><a href=""http://360tree.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">360*tree</a></strong></p>
<p>I believe what happened to me was largely due to stress and doggedly following an inauthentic path. My recovery is testimony to the innate wisdom of the body, its natural inclination towards vitality and the transformative power of ‘disaster’.  Ultimately, I perceive what happened to me as a gift. I hope that by sharing my experience, I might offer constructive alternatives to those trapped in destructive cycles as well as hope to those shattered by some life-changing circumstance. Your support will help pen this story and bring two books to life (Losing My Head and 360*tree).  </p>

<p>If we don’t manage to raise the target, the book will still get written. Somehow. Any funds raised will be invested towards this and funders will <strong>still</strong> receive their perks. Albeit at a later date...</p>
<p>My goal is to launch the book on 09 February 2014, the 8<sup>th </sup>anniversary, of the swift blow to the head that changed everything... for the better. Supporters of this project will receive their copies earlier, as soon as the book’s complete.</p>

<h3>Why Back This Project?</h3>
<p>Being both a passionate reader and writer, I’ve found solace in stories since I was a child. As I‘ve journeyed, meeting unknown situations both terrible and terrific, the shared experience of friends, family and strangers (in the guise of authors, poets and songwriters) has served as an invaluable compass. I believe there’s a power in our stories, both individual and collective, and by sharing them, we act as ‘turnkeys’ for one another. This sense is substantiated by ancient wisdoms from around the world which view story, myth and faerytales as sacred medicine to help us heal.</p>
<p>I believe this story can inspire people to seek what is truly important and of value in their lives, orientate towards greater balance and lead more meaning filled lives – without having to get sick or face death. The stroke helped me face my greatest fears, choose a path toward freedom which revealed life's endless abundance of intense joys, simple pleasures and mundane magic, the very things we tend to forget or overlook in today’s choatic world. I hope my book will help readers re-appreciate the amazing gift life is and recognise the awe and wonder inherent in every passing day.</p>

<b>
</b></p><p><b><b><b><b>Who I am and why I wrote the book:</b></b></b></b></p><b><b>
</b></b><p>My name is Sharlyn Hidalgo and I am an author
and metaphysical teacher and have traveled to Egypt many times because
of my great love for Egypt. Through my travels I got to know the
owner of Quest Travel, Mr. Nazmy, who proved to be mentor, business alchemist,
spiritual warrior, and all around amazing human being worth emulating. Egypt,
Quest Travel, and Mr. Nazmy had a profound effect upon me, and this is true of
thousands of others who have come to know Nazmy through their travels to
Egypt. I was so mobilized and changed by Nazmy and his efforts in Egypt
that I wanted to bring his story to the world.  It has implications
for how to create peace in our lives and in our world.</p>
<p><b>What the book is about:</b></p>
<p>This is the story of how one spiritual man has changed
the face of travel in Egypt through his vision of creating peace, one
relationship at a time, as people from the Middle East and the West come to know
each other as friends.  The purpose of this
spiritual alchemy is to raise consciousness and foster peace on the planet.
Mohamed Nazmy, his travel company Quest Travel, the many new thought teachers and scholars who travel with him, and the powerful healing energies of ancient and modern Egypt, along with the kind and warm<b> </b>hearted people of Egypt, are all working together to make this happen.<br/></p><p>This is the story of one man's living example of how to create peace every moment in your daily life.  This is the story of the big work that is being done to open travelers' 
hearts and minds and encourage tolerance. And this is the story about how we
can change our consciousness and celebrate our differences.  This is also a story about Egypt, and
her people, who are presently struggling to form their own definition of democracy.<b> </b>The book is full of practical spiritual teachings and wisdom from Nazmy himself, as well as from the spiritual teachers who travel with him.  Read this book and perhaps you too will jump on the peace bus<i>
</i>and become one of Nazmy's peace ambassadors<i>.</i> In this way we can all become
world citizens together and have and impact upon our world. By contributing to
this project you are doing something worthwhile.</p>
<p><b>What is the benefit to humanity?</b> <br/></p><p>My friend Suzanne Lentz, a friend and colleague wrote
these words: “I want to create a world in which each person feels whole and
loved; a world where folks feel free to show their authentic selves -- to stand
in their power and shine the light of their individual souls out into the
universe.”</p>
<p>This reminded me so much of Nazmy. He too wants to
create such a world, and in fact he does. This is his universal service. While
he conducts his business and shares his country through his award winning company,
he also is helping to create a safe place for people to open to their true
power and light and to new potential and possibility. This is part of the magic
of interacting with him.  It is nearly impossible for him to see people
other than in this light.<b></b></p><p><b>Why this
project is important:</b></p>
<p>Many of us benefit from mentors and examples. When
someone really aspires to true prosperity and gratitude, by being generous and
loving, it touches our hearts and opens us up. We often think of such a person
as a spiritual guide or leader. Nazmy is truly one of those inspiring wise
men.</p>
<p>I call him a magus not only because he is a spiritual mentor, but because he is also a magician and knows how to create what it is that he has a vision for. Nazmy is a master exemplar in this regard. He believes we all are a unique expression of the divine and he likes to remind us of this. Nazmy simply loves people, and is motivated to express that love. We can do the same. We too can create peace any time and any where. This is the message.

<p></p></div>","Who I am and why I wrote the book:
My name is Sharlyn Hidalgo and I am an author
and metaphysical teacher and have traveled to Egypt many times because
of my great love for Egypt. Through my travels I got to know the
owner of Quest Travel, Mr. Nazmy, who proved to be mentor, business alchemist,
spiritual warrior, and all around amazing human being worth emulating. Egypt,
Quest Travel, and Mr. Nazmy had a profound effect upon me, and this is true of
thousands of others who have come to know Nazmy through their travels to
Egypt. I was so mobilized and changed by Nazmy and his efforts in Egypt
that I wanted to bring his story to the world.  It has implications
for how to create peace in our lives and in our world.
What the book is about:
This is the story of how one spiritual man has changed
the face of travel in Egypt through his vision of creating peace, one
relationship at a time, as people from the Middle East and the West come to know
each other as friends.  The purpose of this
spiritual alchemy is to raise consciousness and foster peace on the planet.
Mohamed Nazmy, his travel company Quest Travel, the many new thought teachers and scholars who travel with him, and the powerful healing energies of ancient and modern Egypt, along with the kind and warm hearted people of Egypt, are all working together to make this happen.This is the story of one man's living example of how to create peace every moment in your daily life.  This is the story of the big work that is being done to open travelers' 
hearts and minds and encourage tolerance. And this is the story about how we
can change our consciousness and celebrate our differences.  This is also a story about Egypt, and
her people, who are presently struggling to form their own definition of democracy. The book is full of practical spiritual teachings and wisdom from Nazmy himself, as well as from the spiritual teachers who travel with him.  Read this book and perhaps you too will jump on the peace bus
and become one of Nazmy's peace ambassadors. In this way we can all become
world citizens together and have and impact upon our world. By contributing to
this project you are doing something worthwhile.
What is the benefit to humanity? My friend Suzanne Lentz, a friend and colleague wrote
these words: “I want to create a world in which each person feels whole and
loved; a world where folks feel free to show their authentic selves -- to stand
in their power and shine the light of their individual souls out into the
universe.”
This reminded me so much of Nazmy. He too wants to
create such a world, and in fact he does. This is his universal service. While
he conducts his business and shares his country through his award winning company,
he also is helping to create a safe place for people to open to their true
power and light and to new potential and possibility. This is part of the magic
of interacting with him.  It is nearly impossible for him to see people
other than in this light.Why this
project is important:
Many of us benefit from mentors and examples. When
someone really aspires to true prosperity and gratitude, by being generous and
loving, it touches our hearts and opens us up. We often think of such a person
as a spiritual guide or leader. Nazmy is truly one of those inspiring wise
men.
I call him a magus not only because he is a spiritual mentor, but because he is also a magician and knows how to create what it is that he has a vision for. Nazmy is a master exemplar in this regard. He believes we all are a unique expression of the divine and he likes to remind us of this. Nazmy simply loves people, and is motivated to express that love. We can do the same. We too can create peace any time and any where. This is the message. We just need open hearts and open minds. 
Through Quest Travel he meets thousands of travelers.  He demonstrates positive
and sincere regard for every human being that he comes in contact with. He asks them to become his peace ambassadors, to go home and tell about their experiences in Egypt. Mohamed knows many new thought teachers and authors who travel with his company and bring tours to Egypt. He has prepared the tours for such people as Gregg Braden, Jean Houston, Nicki Scully, and Maureen St. Germain. They are part of Nazmy's peace team, and they are a part of mine. They teach about unity and new ways of being together on the planet that do not involve war and further violence.  They are encouraging us to identify with our spiritual natures. By sharing their stories in this book, they share Egypt and this consciousness.
Come and be inspired! I invite you to get on Nazmy's peace bus by contributing to this campaign. In this was we all participate in spreading the good news that we are more alike than different, and that we are each others' brothers and sisters.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">We are Candy and KB, two Austinite 'zinesters who couldn't help but notice how prevalent and inspiring the D.I.Y. culture is in Austin. It's everywhere from the stencil or knit installation on the street corner to the countertops or bathroom door of your favorite bar. There's a huge culture of people who make their lives simpler and more affordable by making something out of what otherwise could be considered nothing. We are in awe of the urban beauty, functionality and cultural message that these projects bring to our lives every day. </span></h3>
<div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></div>
<p>Therefore, we decided to use our lust for print and the process behind 'zining to pay tribute to D.I.Y. culture and the many creative and interesting minds behind it.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are both 20 somethings trying to balance the desire to make an impact on our surrounding community while working multiple jobs to make ends meet. Such is the strife of young, talented, educated Austin. But instead of letting the pressure bog us down at the end of the day, we've chosen to harvest our inspiration into energy and explore the ways that people around us are using resources and art to not only cope with these times we are in... but make the best they can out of them. Being broke can be fun. It just takes an open mind and the desire to turn nothing into something. The interviews and snapshots in our 'zine highlight just a handful of the people we've had the pleasure to speak with who don't rely on others to make things happen for them. They do it themselves. And they are happy to share what they do with others. And that's what we're all about too.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We started the 'zine a couple of months ago and put out the first issue December 9th. It's made a positive impact on our community already and we are excited about working on issue II.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our 'zine is advertisement free and free to the public. We want to keep it this way because we want to make it as real and accessible as possible. We've distributed 200 issues over the first weekend, from our hands to the readers. We will continue to distribute by means of local bookstores, collectives, coffee shops and the baskets of our bikes. </p>
<p>The feedback from our readers so far has been overwhelming. We've stirred up a momentum toward creativity and community building. We've linked resources which are the recipe for new projects, collectives and collaborations. It's amazing to watch the sparks that this issue has created. These sparks were especially interesting to watch between issue I's contributors and interviewees at our launch party.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are very excited to see what we can help stir up in our community over upcoming issues.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We need to raise $1,500 in 45 days. This amount in full would finish paying off our credit card for the printing of the first issue (yikes! interest!) and fully fund the printing for the second issue which, as we said, we'd like to have released in two months. If IndieGoGo is successful for us, we'd like to continue using it, in conjunction with fundraising parties and events, for all of our future issues. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If we cannot reach our entire goal through IndieGoGo, we will still but the money toward print cost and do what we can through other methods of fundraising to cover the costs. Any amount we make will be put toward paying off issue I first, and the remainder will go toward funding the second issue. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We will put out a second issue, no matter how little we make. Our community is interested in what we are doing and what the D.I.Y. culture in Austin is doing. We won't let them our ourselves down. The risk of not raising the money, however, is a smaller 'zine with less content and less copies for distribution. This is not what we hope for pR. We would like it to reach as many people as possible and we would like it to be the kind of publication you keep around. Small, independent press is here. Please support it.</p>
<p><br/></p>

Don't forget to like us on Facebook, where you can keep up-to-date with future fundraising parties, tablings and releases.

<h3>COMMENT DEVENIR UN LEADER EN DÉVELOPPEMENT DURABLE</h3>
<p><strong>Guide pour intégrer la nouvelle norme BNQ 21000 à vos pratiques d'affaires</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> Avez-vous envie d'aider votre organisation à prendre le virage du développement durable?</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> Comment convaincre votre patron d'aller de l'avant?</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> Par où commencer, comment faire?</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> Quelles sont les facteurs de succès d'une démarche de développement durable?</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> Quels sont les pièges à éviter?</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> Qu'est-ce que la norme BNQ 21000, comment l'utiliser?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Je m'appelle Jean-Sébastien Trudel (ma <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/individuals/1346345"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Jean-Sébastien Trudel"">bio</a>) et je travaille à la publication d'un livre pour vous aider à devenir un leader en développement durable à l'aide de la méthode BNQ 21000.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>MISE EN CONTEXTE</strong></p>
<p>Depuis près de 10 ans, j'accompagne les dirigeants et les gestionnaires dans l'intégration du développement durable dans leurs pratiques d'affaires. Certains projets d'accompagnement connaissent un véritable succès alors que d'autres ne dépassent pas les initiatives élémentaires, comme instaurer un système de recyclage ou remplacer les tasses jetables par des tasses réutilisables.</p>
<p>Cependant, l'expérience montre que tous les projets qui connaissent du succès ont un point en commun: ils sont pilotés par des leaders passionnés et respectés de la direction et de leurs collègues.</p>
<p>Aussi sait-on que ces leaders manquent généralement d'outils et de moyens pour prendre le virage du développement durable. C'est pourquoi le gouvernement du Québec a financer un projet de normalisation d'une méthode d'accompagnement: le BNQ 21000.</p>
<p> </p>
<strong>QU'EST-CE QUE LA MÉTHODE BNQ 21000?</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Le Bureau de normalisation du Québec (BNQ) lancera officiellement, le 19 novembre prochain, tous les outils de la nouvelle norme BNQ 21000.
<p>En 2008, le gouvernement du Québec s’est donné comme cible que <strong>20 % des entreprises québécoises aient amorcé une démarche de développement durable d’ici 2013</strong>.</p>
<p>Le Projet BNQ 21000 vise donc à offrir une norme de référence et des outils pour que les entreprises d'ici puissent progresser dans une perspective de développement durable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>POURQUOI UN LIVRE?<br/></strong></p>
<p>L'idée du livre est d'aider les leaders dans les organisations et les entreprises à mettre en oeuvre une démarche de développement durable.</p>
<p>Il vise à leur donner des outils et à départager les approches qui fonctionnent le mieux de celles qui conduisent à l'échec. Bref, il s'agit d'apprendre des erreurs des autres pour progresser plus facilement et plus rapidement.</p>
<p>Pour y arriver, le livre présentera sous forme de guide la nouvelle méthode BNQ 21000.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>POURQUOI MAINTENANT?</strong></p>
<p>Depuis 2010, je suis mandaté pour contribuer au développement de ce projet, qui a été testé dans près d'une soixantaine d'organisations par une douzaine de consultants.</p>
<p>Au cours de cette période, la norme et les outils ont fait l'objet de plusieurs révisions. À partir du 19 novembre prochain, tous les référentiels et les outils seront rendus publics gratuitement.</p>
<p>Cependant, il n'y a pas de guide vulgarisé pour les gens d'affaires. C'est ce que je compte faire à l'aide de ce livre, en bonifiant la méthode à partir d'exemples vécus sur le terrain et en partageant mes meilleurs trucs pour vous aider à réaliser votre démarche de manière autonome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>POURQUOI NE PAS AVOIR UN ÉDITEUR?</strong></p>
</div>
<div>Ce livre propose une approche différente de mise en marché:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Ce sera un livre sans papier. Il sera disponible uniquement en version électronique.</li>
<li>Il sera distribué exclusivement en ligne.</li>
<li>Différentes options seront disponibles avec le livre, comme un DVD d'une formation pour les employés, des mises à jours ou encore, du coaching individualisé.</li>
</ul>
Cette formule vise à tirer profit des nouvelles possibilités d'Internet, du multimédia et des tablettes numériques. Il s'agit donc d'un laboratoire qui ne convient pas aux méthodes traditionnelles des éditeurs.</div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>À PROPOS DU TITRE!</strong></p>
<p>Avec des titres comme:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://jeansebastientrudel.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arrêtons de pisser dans de l'eau embouteillée</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://legrandmensongevert.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Le grand mensonge vert"">Le grand mensonge vert</a></li>
</ul><p>On me demande souvent quel sera le titre du prochain livre. La pression est donc grande pour trouver un titre original. Il sera dévoilé ici en primeur le 9 octobre 2012, vers 15h!</p>
<p>D'ici là, je vous invite me dire lequel des trois titres encore en lice vous préférez en <a href=""http://www.jeansebastientrudel.com/2012/10/quel-titre-de-livre-preferez-vous.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: line-through;"">VOTANT</span></a>.</p>
<p>MISE À JOUR: La période de sondage est maintenant terminé. Le titre retenu sera:</p>
<p><em>Au secours! La planète se meurt et mon boss s'en fout</em></p>
<p>Merci aux 94 personnes qui ont pris le temps de voter. Ce choix a été préféré par 42% d'entre elles.</p>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>À QUOI SERVIRONT LES FONDS?</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>La publication d'un livre, même électronique, implique des coûts importants, pour la plupart préalables au lancement, tels que:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>La recherche et la rédaction (déplacements, frais de communication, etc.)</li>
<li>Le graphisme et la mise en page</li>
<li>La correction</li>
<li>La révision et l'édition</li>
<li>La programmation et le développement d'un site Internet</li>
<li>La réservation des marques, ISBN, site, etc.</li>
<li>La campagne de promotion et les relations publiques</li>
<li>L'enregistrement du DVD pour la formation (caméras, micros, éclairage, salle de conférence, montage et production)</li>
<li>La soirée de lancement</li>
</ul>
<p>Au total, le projet coûtera entre 10 000 et 15 000 $.</p>
<p>Mon objectif de financement est au minimum 7 000 $.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>COMMENT POUVEZ-VOUS AIDER?</strong></p>
<p>Il existe plusieurs façon pour m'aider à réaliser ce projet:</p>
<ol>
<li>En achetant en pré-vente une copie du livre.</li>
<li>En assistant à la conférence du 31 octobre à Montréal.</li>
<li>En faisant un don de 5 $.</li>
<li>En étant commanditaire.</li>
<li>En devenant un partenaire-affilié (écrivez-moi pour savoir comment).</li>
<li>En diffusant la nouvelle dans vos réseaux.</li>
<li>En donnant une copie à votre patron, à un ami ou à un collègue.</li>
</ol>
<p>Il vous suffit de cliquer à droite sur l'option de votre choix. Parce que je considère ceux qui me soutienne dans cet effort comme des partenaires privilégiés, les tarifs proposés ici représentent <strong>un rabais de 50% par rapport au prix régulier</strong>. Merci de votre confiance.</p>

Depuis près de 10 ans, j'accompagne les dirigeants et les gestionnaires dans l'intégration du développement durable dans leurs pratiques d'affaires. Certains projets d'accompagnement connaissent un véritable succès alors que d'autres ne dépassent pas les initiatives élémentaires, comme instaurer un système de recyclage ou remplacer les tasses jetables par des tasses réutilisables.
Cependant, l'expérience montre que tous les projets qui connaissent du succès ont un point en commun: ils sont pilotés par des leaders passionnés et respectés de la direction et de leurs collègues.
Aussi sait-on que ces leaders manquent généralement d'outils et de moyens pour prendre le virage du développement durable. C'est pourquoi le gouvernement du Québec a financer un projet de normalisation d'une méthode d'accompagnement: le BNQ 21000.
 
QU'EST-CE QUE LA MÉTHODE BNQ 21000?

 
Le Bureau de normalisation du Québec (BNQ) lancera officiellement, le 19 novembre prochain, tous les outils de la nouvelle norme BNQ 21000.
En 2008, le gouvernement du Québec s’est donné comme cible que 20 % des entreprises québécoises aient amorcé une démarche de développement durable d’ici 2013.
Le Projet BNQ 21000 vise donc à offrir une norme de référence et des outils pour que les entreprises d'ici puissent progresser dans une perspective de développement durable.
 
POURQUOI UN LIVRE?
L'idée du livre est d'aider les leaders dans les organisations et les entreprises à mettre en oeuvre une démarche de développement durable.
Il vise à leur donner des outils et à départager les approches qui fonctionnent le mieux de celles qui conduisent à l'échec. Bref, il s'agit d'apprendre des erreurs des autres pour progresser plus facilement et plus rapidement.
Pour y arriver, le livre présentera sous forme de guide la nouvelle méthode BNQ 21000.
 
POURQUOI MAINTENANT?
Depuis 2010, je suis mandaté pour contribuer au développement de ce projet, qui a été testé dans près d'une soixantaine d'organisations par une douzaine de consultants.
Au cours de cette période, la norme et les outils ont fait l'objet de plusieurs révisions. À partir du 19 novembre prochain, tous les référentiels et les outils seront rendus publics gratuitement.
Cependant, il n'y a pas de guide vulgarisé pour les gens d'affaires. C'est ce que je compte faire à l'aide de ce livre, en bonifiant la méthode à partir d'exemples vécus sur le terrain et en partageant mes meilleurs trucs pour vous aider à réaliser votre démarche de manière autonome.
 
POURQUOI NE PAS AVOIR UN ÉDITEUR?

Ce livre propose une approche différente de mise en marché:


Ce sera un livre sans papier. Il sera disponible uniquement en version électronique.
Il sera distribué exclusivement en ligne.
Différentes options seront disponibles avec le livre, comme un DVD d'une formation pour les employés, des mises à jours ou encore, du coaching individualisé.

Cette formule vise à tirer profit des nouvelles possibilités d'Internet, du multimédia et des tablettes numériques. Il s'agit donc d'un laboratoire qui ne convient pas aux méthodes traditionnelles des éditeurs.
 
À PROPOS DU TITRE!
Avec des titres comme:

Arrêtons de pisser dans de l'eau embouteillée
Le grand mensonge vert
On me demande souvent quel sera le titre du prochain livre. La pression est donc grande pour trouver un titre original. Il sera dévoilé ici en primeur le 9 octobre 2012, vers 15h!
D'ici là, je vous invite me dire lequel des trois titres encore en lice vous préférez en VOTANT.
MISE À JOUR: La période de sondage est maintenant terminé. Le titre retenu sera:
Au secours! La planète se meurt et mon boss s'en fout
Merci aux 94 personnes qui ont pris le temps de voter. Ce choix a été préféré par 42% d'entre elles.
 
À QUOI SERVIRONT LES FONDS?
 
La publication d'un livre, même électronique, implique des coûts importants, pour la plupart préalables au lancement, tels que:


La recherche et la rédaction (déplacements, frais de communication, etc.)
Le graphisme et la mise en page
La correction
La révision et l'édition
La programmation et le développement d'un site Internet
La réservation des marques, ISBN, site, etc.
La campagne de promotion et les relations publiques
L'enregistrement du DVD pour la formation (caméras, micros, éclairage, salle de conférence, montage et production)
La soirée de lancement

Au total, le projet coûtera entre 10 000 et 15 000 $.
Mon objectif de financement est au minimum 7 000 $.
 
COMMENT POUVEZ-VOUS AIDER?
Il existe plusieurs façon pour m'aider à réaliser ce projet:

En achetant en pré-vente une copie du livre.
En assistant à la conférence du 31 octobre à Montréal.
En faisant un don de 5 $.
En étant commanditaire.
En devenant un partenaire-affilié (écrivez-moi pour savoir comment).
En diffusant la nouvelle dans vos réseaux.
En donnant une copie à votre patron, à un ami ou à un collègue.

Il vous suffit de cliquer à droite sur l'option de votre choix. Parce que je considère ceux qui me soutienne dans cet effort comme des partenaires privilégiés, les tarifs proposés ici représentent un rabais de 50% par rapport au prix régulier. Merci de votre confiance.

<p>Welcome!</p>
<p>Thanks so much for helping me manifest my goal of publishing my first memoir. <strong>My Life, a Four Letter Word: Confessions of a Counter Culture Diva. </strong>It is a project I am very passionate about. The memoir is a send up to “my big little life” and a fabled era and a community that I am so very grateful for today.</p>
<p>Being what the economy is in this strange new world I call past- middle- age, I have exhausted leads to find a publishing house for my first book. Therefore, I have decided to take the advice of esteemed writer friends and self-publish this work of love.</p>
<p>Your contributions will be used wisely to pay for the many aspects to suceed with my vision for this project: editing, art work, formating and printing for both a hard copy and formatting for an E-book for your Kindel or Nook. Some of the funds will also help toward the budget for marketing and travel to reading's and book launches at a book store near you.</p>
<p>The publication of <strong>My Life, a Four Letter Word: Confessions of a Counter Culture Diva </strong>is extremely important to me. It is a portrait of a single mom raising a bi-racial daughter during the tumultuous post Stonewall times inside the Gay Counter Culture. In this ultra-fabulous queer theatrical community I found refuge after being rejected by my family for giving birth to a mixed race daughter.</p>
<p>Written from my view as a  less-than five foot Diva in six inch heels, I created a new family with the most unlikely people under the most unusual circumstances. Through tears and glitter, I confess to my encounters with endless bad boys and loving gay “husbands.” stripping in dive bars, and surviving bitter family estrangements that led to heartfelt reconciliations. And then faced the pain of the AIDS crisis first-hand.</p>
<p>As the adage goes, ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.” So with candor, humor and the wisdom of a survivor, I offer the lessons learned as well as unique insights from an era that was one of our country’s most vivid periods.</p>

<p>BIO</p>
<p>I have been a performer since 1970 and was trained by the best artists of those times, including the legendary Divine, who mentored my early career on stage.

<p>I began writing for and performed with comedy troupes including White Trash Boom Boom, a girl’s group who wowed the boys in the San Francisco gay bars and performed the same shows for women behind bars in California state prisons.</p>
<p>By 1977, I was nominated for “Best Performer in a Musical,” by The Bay Area Credits Association for the musical revue, <em>Broken Dishes,</em> which I co-wrote and starred in with Amber Waves. I brought my act to Los Angeles where I wrote and starred in a critically acclaimed, multi-media romp, <em>The Last Dance of the Couch Potatoes.</em></p>

<p>Hola a todos, mi nombre es Pablo Estrada Fuentes y soy un guatemalteco más.</p>
<p>Licenciado en Publicidad y RPPP de la Universidad de Navarra, mi único sueño es ver una mejor Guatemala y dedico mi vida a ello, desde mis negocios hasta mis hobbies.</p>
<p>Si quieren saber más de mí pueden ver algunas cosas que he hecho:</p>

<p>La razón por la que decidí hacer este movimiento es para que nosotros los guatemaltecos, sin esperar nada de los gobiernos, le demos una pequeña ayuda a Erick Barrondo.</p>
<p>¿Se han puesto a pensar que la única persona que ha ganado una medalla olímpica para nuestro país vive en una casa de bajos recursos; o que los primeros tres meses como seleccionado durmió en el piso de la casa de su entrenador?</p>

Hola a todos, mi nombre es Pablo Estrada Fuentes y soy un guatemalteco más.
Licenciado en Publicidad y RPPP de la Universidad de Navarra, mi único sueño es ver una mejor Guatemala y dedico mi vida a ello, desde mis negocios hasta mis hobbies.

La razón por la que decidí hacer este movimiento es para que nosotros los guatemaltecos, sin esperar nada de los gobiernos, le demos una pequeña ayuda a Erick Barrondo.
¿Se han puesto a pensar que la única persona que ha ganado una medalla olímpica para nuestro país vive en una casa de bajos recursos; o que los primeros tres meses como seleccionado durmió en el piso de la casa de su entrenador?
¿Cuánto nos gastamos a la semana en ocio, fiesta, comida rápida o gustos?
Les propongo a los guatemaltecos y el resto del planeta que donen lo que puedan.
Por cada persona que done les ofrezco incluir su nombre en un cartel que le entregaré a Erick, con los nombres de todas las personas que donaron.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Joseph Paul Haines.  I am a professional science fiction writer of over one hundred short stories whose work has been recognized in almost every collection of year's best fiction. My stories have been reprinted various times, most recently in a collection of the best dystopian short fiction ever written, alongside stories by Ray Bradbury, Shirley Jackson, Harlan Ellison, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., and Neil Gaiman.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I've focused on short fiction over the span of my career, honing my story-telling skills and learning the business and art of being a professional writer, but the biggest reason I didn't write novels was that I didn't want to write a novel that couldn't speed you along with the breakneck pace of a short story.  I love the thrill of turning the pages with reckless abandon while reading and I want to produce fiction that does the same for my audience.  Until I found the story I could tell that would yank the reader along at a breathless pace and a character with whom they could fall in love, I wouldn't fall into the trap of so many writers who switched to the long form just because it it was the expected thing to do.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Four months ago, all that changed.  My imagination met a young lady by the name of Punk Jordan and all hell broke loose.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The first book of this planned trilogy is titled, ""Marooned,"" and it is finished, edited and available in e-versions as I write this, with the trade paperback version to follow September 15th, 2011.  The video trailer for the first book is above to give you a taste of the series and I'm writing under the pen-name of P.J. Druce in order to keep this Young Adult series separate from my more adult short stories.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I was able to fund the editing, cover design, interior design, book trailer and extra expenses on my own for Marooned, but due to life changes over the last few weeks I find that the next two are going to need a little help. That's where you come in.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I'd like to raise enough money to fund the publication of the next two books, along with a limited edition hard-back version containing all three books by June of 2012.  Book one is written, book two is in process and book three will immediately follow.   </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I won't lie to you.  I will proceed with publishing these books on my own even if I don't meet my goal, but I'd most likely have to extend the timeframe.  One of the reasons I pulled these books from consideration by major literary agencies was that I didn't want my readers to have to wait two years just to get their hands on the first book, and then wait another year at least for each successive volume.  I walked away from a potentially large advance in order to bring these books directly to my readers in a timely fashion, but in doing so took on all costs associated with their publication.  I think it's worth it.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Between professional editing, cover design, marketing and associated fees, the cost of publishing each book with the quality you'd expect from a major publishing house is between a thousand and fifteen hundred dollars.  Yes, it can be done for less but it's always been my belief that if you aren't putting out a product that equalled the quality of anything you can find on the shelves of your local bookstore that you're cheating your readers.  The limited edition hardback will run approximately the same as new cover art and interior design will be necessary.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I completely understand if you can't donate to the cause.  Money is tight these days and were that not the case I wouldn't be here asking you to contribute.  If you can't add a few dollars (every one counts!) then pass the link along through social media.  The more people that see this page the more people can help finance this series.  More than anything else, if you'd read all the way to this point, accept my sincere thanks for allowing me a few moments of your time.  More than money, your time and tolerance for allowing me to ask you to help out is the most precious thing you could give.</p>

Networking became a great longing of the dawning computer age.Illegal activities on 16-bit computers began after two hackers left the Apple II to face new electronic fields. The idea of the digital troll only came to full bloom in the 2000s. This book tells the story of a group of hitherto unknown computer experts who sacrificed their youth to the gamers’ entertainment. They were called Crackers.Many excellent programmers whose only home for a long time was the boot sector, learned their craft by breaking a copy protection. It was no easy task. They worked hard at night and found their sources far away from the consumer. Eventually they found success as their raster bars, scroll texts, pixel art and chip music, spreaded through the disk slots of hundreds of thousands of young people who just wanted to play.Cracktros became popular. The times were a paradise for pirates, for the few lucky ones, as only the people with the most influential contacts were high up enough in the scene and to be able to play the trickiest game called “software piracy”. The 80s felt just right for that and everybody hoped for his secret little slice of illegal pie.  The cracker’s hour, it had to come ...Read about 42-Crew, The Medway Boys, Cynix, Hackers Of The Arena, B.O.S.S, Fallen Angels, The Marvellous V8, Black Monolith Team, Pompey Pirates, CSS, Fuzion, ICS, MCA, Hotline,Flame of Finland, D-Bug, Vectronix, TEX, Delight, Adrenaline U.K., Admirables, Bad Boys, BBS, Sewer Software, S.T.C.S. ... and many more. Learn about the structure, the changes, development and history of the greatest cracking associations on the Atari ST computers: Automation, The Blade Runners, Elite, Empire, Federation of Free Traders, The Replicants, The Corporation.Their experience stands for the 16-bit era of hacking and cracking in general. This book will summarize the dark side of disk life as a unique contemporary spiritual phenomenon. It is our goal to tell the truth behind the entanglements of the games industry in the 80s and 90s. The plot will reveal how it was possible to crack and spread diskette games so efficiently in Europe and worldwide.In a narrative journey through time, Microzeit will let the top crackers have their say and report from their teenage bedrooms. The Atari ST scene will be the heart of the story, but we also take the journey back to the 8-bit era on the C64 and deliver sidekicks to Apple II, Atari XL, Amstrad CPC and Sinclair Spectrum. Also Amiga insiders joined in.You will find yourself side by side with the famous swappers and experience what computer life was like at that time. What possibilities and machinations did one have to deal with and how did  they spin the strings to their shady sources. We tell the story from an underground perspective and let it collide with the media, the law and game producers.Interviews We ask the people.

E-mail: mbreddin[at]gmail.com Overview In the following section we introduce the main topics. They will accompany the narrative. The book will be narrated in the tradition of The Atari ST and The Creative People and is driven by protagonists of the cracking scene. When Cracking became popular ... A blazing C64 nostalgia tour written by David Almer. The passionate editor of the Swedish magazines Axess and Aorta has published numerous articles in Datormagazin Retro. He also knows everything about Genesis Project: The largest cross-platform collaboration among the most productive C64 cracking groups was founded in the late 80s and is still active. As a true insider, Almer tells you the story that made cracking so popular.The colourful flashback to formative groups and cracktros of Fairlight, Eagle Soft Incorp., Radwar, Dynamic Duo, Hotline, Mr. Z, Strike Force, Triad, Yeti, 1001, ABC, Ikari and others ... “Danger of Software Piracy”The times were chaotic and the law was not prepared for what was coming. State authority and law operated side by side to attempt to eliminate the piracy networks. One example of such took place in Germany when a judge declared a personal war on the whole cracking scene. The likes of famous personalities such as Günter Freiherr von Gravenreuth turned up at “copy parties” and side by side he sat next to crackers on TV shows. Eventually documentary films began to appear questioning the sense of computer games altogether.We undertake a dramatic flight through the contemporary press and media. The book will reheat the “danger of piracy”.  The Dark Net of the 80sUp to 100 people came together in the various subgroups of what they referrred to as The Blade Runners. Half as much in The Replicants. With various groups forming on the dark net of the 80s, the race for the fastest crack began.In Germany, France and the United Kingdom in particular, conspiratorial information chains were working secretly from the public to rapidly acquire the hottest software.How did such big underground networks come into being? Who were the suppliers? The dealers? Which roles made a cracking group functional? We keep an eye on the creation, development and organization of the greatest Atari ST-Cracking conspiracies. Copy PartiesIt was an exciting time. Everyone wanted to get their hands on the new digital goods! But up to 80 DM (US$ 40, £ 27) per computer game was just too much for the most young people. As a result “copy parties,” in which people gathered to copy and distribute games, started to be held at secret locations and “warez” attracted every player in the late 80s. It was at these scenes that some of the most notorious people met and it was there that they drew the attention of law enforcement.THE CRACKERS jumps into contemporary events and lets the reader experience what it was like at such meetings. Spirit of SwappingA notorious underground report by Stranger of Hemoroids/Rebels. The former French swapper and pack disk editor stood with both feet firmly planted in the ST and Amiga scene for many years. He took a key position. It was then that an individual called Stranger popped up everywhere and became a central figure of the early European file-sharing scene.As part of numerous trading groups Stranger gives a deep insight into the business and communication of the 90s diskette dealers. Snail Mails & ScribblesWithout the Internet, communication between the groups was often only possible by weeks of postal correspondence. Game lists and recommendations, code snippets and drawings. With the authors’ permissions we will publish some of the most interesting swapper letters for the first time in a book.The digital counterpart was the scroll text. Here the letters were running across the screens, often revealing important scene contacts and praising the crack... Intros, Cracktros, Compact DisksLike magic. On the Atari ST, various cracks were highly compressed and one floppy disk turned into a compact disk. As disk space remained, it was used for an introduction and a way to get in contact with other swappers and traders. This was vital as many groups tried to expand their networks or simply wanted to praise a particularly difficult crack. There were feuds and there was cooperation, but some of the coders preferred to build spectacular graphics and music demonstrations while discovering their enthusiasm for Demo Making.  We show the finest cracktros and look back to the time when the demo scene suddenly became a child of the cracker scene. The Way of a CrackerThe story of hacking and cracking is full of little side stories. We’ve been talking to the insiders. Zippy of The Medway Boys was one of them. We follow him back to when he discovered the British floppy world in the 80s. Very few people at that time understood the mathematics of a crack like he did and fewer can tell you about the inner workings of the dark scene.Come along for a journey down to the cracker’s ground. BBS TimesWritten by Troed, a former SysOp of the International Cracking Service. When night fell, “bulletin boards” became a mysterious meeting point for hackers. They developed into the first interactive network of the computer scene. But with modem speeds of less than 10,000 baud, downloading the latest software was a test of patience. FidoNet, Blue Boxing, Calling Cards – high phone bills had to be avoided and the darkest hours used to minimize costs.In the U.S. Little Lulu’s was the transshipment point for European cracks. But how were the boards operated and who were the SysOps behind such strange aliases? ​ The Secret of Dungeon MasterMany have cracked it. But who has really mastered it? One of the smartest protections was that of the game, Dungeon Master. For over a year the formative Dungeon Crawler resisted attacks from the underground and became the No. 1 bestseller on the Atari ST. It was a quick buy that remained unbeaten with a floppy disk encryption method imitated by many. Cracking this copy protection was one of the toughest challenges a hacker could face.Finally, read the secret story behind the extraordinary copy protection of Dungeon Master. Masters of DecryptionCrackers were forced to think outside the box. They invested all their time to get around the multi-layered encryption technologies. These unknown computer freaks were surrounded by an almost mystical aura. However, their expertise was only passed on to like-minded people. They used homemade ROM cartridges and advanced decrypting methods no one else understood those days. Eventually, some of them were even hired by software companies to develop better encryptions.Even though every second counted, code was mostly analyzed and modified by hand night after night and line after line. For those who were best at it, cracking developed into an art.  Greatest Cryptography (Hall of Fame)War Heli, Parasol Stars and Maupiti Island were some of the most sophisticated protections, including trace encryption, checksums, page zero code and self-modifying code. Interpreted high level language protections were extremely hard to understand for any cracker and made it nearly impossible to find a “key” in time. Games like Future Wars, Operation Stealth, Loom and Monkey Island were fortified by their publishers like castles under siege.We ask the best hackers and compile their hardest decryption challenges in a hall of fame. Trainers & CheatersMany fell in love with games, but not all of them had the patience to beat the challenges they presented. This motivated hackers who were up for a new trial. During a crack, the computer game had to be analyzed in such detail that even bugs in the code were ironed out. As an encore, they levered out game systematics, created infinite lives and weapons, and provided trainers and cheat features for the gamer.It was the right food for starving teenagers who longed for every level of a game. Replicants and Replicates Fast, free, executable. When it came to general cracker attitude, The Replicants were on the front lines. The French Atari formation had one of the most sophisticated illegal networks of its time. It worked like a well-oiled machine. If a cracker wanted to be known, he had to be the first to the goal-post. The group quickly grew into an international organization with worldwide connections, boards and supplier channels.Learn how The Replicants became world famous for “speed”. The whole crew in an interview. Spy vs. Spy Who were the informants, who were the spies? How could they trust each other? Some cracks ended up in the teenagers’ floppy drives even before the game was released. How was that possible?Take a trip to the forgotten diskette countries of the last century and learn about the loopholes of the early computer industry. Producers against Piracy16-bit developers knew their opponents very well (picture: Marc Rosocha/Eclipse). They placed explicit messages on their disks, in a sector that only a cracker would enter. Many scene people rushed into the profession and with the advent of the games industry they opened their own studio when they suddenly had to face an almost impossible task: to sell their idea to an unknown market with renowned crackers. We want to give old feuds new space and let opinions collide. The producers and the scene: a love-hate relationship of unimagined dimensions. Rob Northern’s CopylockRob Northern turned the disk into a vault.  The industry standard disk protection on the Atari ST was ported to the Amiga. It was very clever, but was it clever enough? We not only analyse the way it works, but also ask the experts for the possibility of an unbreakable protection. What kind of thinking was necessary to develop a functional encryption? What kind for decryption? Was the ST designed in such a way that, if an encryption was used to its fullest, even a fanatic cracker would not have had any chance?We search for the limits of thinking and ask the crackers for their finest hours. The Underground WarsThe illegal race for intelligence, speed and distribution began. Which crack lands first at the player and which features can be included? Will it work on the different computer models of the ST and Amiga series? There were two sides: those who wanted to do business and those who saw it as a free service to the digital people.When the underground wars broke out, everything had to change and many groups were caught in their blazing flames. The Art of Compact DiskThe cracking machine could no longer be stopped and the competition for attention grew tougher. The so-called Compact Disks needed a more eye-catching presentation – sometimes even a political statement. The production pressure was high and very small number of graphic artists had to deal with a lot of demanding pixel work in a short time. Two of them in particular stand out: Wizpop and Syd B. They almost did all the work for the likes of Automation, Medway Boys or Pompey Pirates.Experience their best pixel artworks for the first time in a book. Digital CopiesNot only were the games cracked, the groups did not stop at the seemingly invincible protection of a paper manual. The illegal upload of physical data – it started in the 90s. We talk to the only group on the ST that specialized in transferring physical manuals to floppy disk. Their Doc Disks were on everyone’s radar and appeared non-stop.How did these geeks manage to digitize the partly 100-page game manuals on such a large scale using simple technical means? Cracking BusinessBesides the free distribution, which was part of the ethos of many crackers, there were also a number of underground dealers who made profit from the cracks. The mass sale of these games has enriched some unpopular personalities. They became first class diskette dealers and inflicted enourmous damage on the industry.Track down the shady underground trading of the hottest floppy goods. Cracking ToolsRipping, debugging, packing, unpacking, DMA loading, automated cracking, copying, sector-to-file technologies: crackers had their own techniques to get to the encryption. Initially, in the underground scene, special software and hardware was developed that the market never saw, sometimes even with a soldering iron. The book will show examples of these proprietary solutions. But all this changed as The Medway Boys and Adrenaline released ripping tools that anyone could use. Suddenly the world of cracking became open to everyone. ASCII ArtA cross scene feature by Senser (SNS), French Ascii artist. Developed mainly through restrictions on low data transmission in the bulletin boards more and more Ascii images evolved. Logos and graphics made with the character set only. Senser talks about the difference of the Atari and Amiga character sets, the restrictions and the signature character of the hardly considered graphic art. His works have been published widely and on numerous systems since 1994: ST, Amiga, Falcon, Windows and MS-DOS.The book shows the most outstanding ASCII works with explanations in a special section. The Great Interpol RaidsMountains of 3.5 inch floppy disks were hidden deep in cellars. Copy stations, copy parties and copy sessions spread “warez” first all over Europe, and then across the world. As these copies were spreading like a virus, the law struck. Wherever you turned, you could be betrayed. Paranoia took hold. The hunt for “software pirates” had begun and The Criminal Police Organisation searched for the private homes of well-known dealers in international operational raids.Read about the consequences of illegal diskette trading in the age of home computers. Has Piracy killed 16-bit Games?ST/Amiga Format, ST Action, ACE, ST Magazine, Génération 4, Happy Computer, Power Play, ASM – above all, the game-concentrated magazines sought ways to address the scene and encouraged young buyers to maintain the games market and their jobs. What impact has piracy had on the programming market and computer sales? Undertake a press analysis with us – we ask the industry experts for facts and figures. When Demo infected Cracktro ...The development of 16-bit programming was mutually beneficial. The demo scene was known for extremely efficient machine code, which also challenged the cracktro scene and vis-à-vis. Intros became demos and demos became full-blown menus with joystick control. THE CRACKERS delivers an interesting insight into the artistic aspects of screen programming.We look at the iconic side of cracktros and search for decisive works with formative aesthetics and technology and ask what has developed and changed over time. The Crackers GoodiesNow let us have a look at the goodies which you are going to get with the different backing options. The following pictures are made for illustration purposes and show the different packages which are tied to the perks. Let’s get into it. Browse the borders. First time you are able to experience Volume 1 as digital version. The whole layout for your PC or Tablet in half the printing resolution! Open up every fluid treasure with this great mobile cracker! Feel the power and decrypt the bottles of your choice. Get an aluminium cap lifter with metal key ring. Design will be chosen through survey after the campaign.  Do you always like to have your hot tea or coffee right next to your computer? This is the right coaster for you! And those cracking hours! Two coasters are coming with the set. Not yet designed. The new 6-pack with postcard motifs of classic iconic Atari ST cracktros. For the collector and the writer or just for a cracking thought: these cards are simply something special. Motifs will be carefully chosen. What could that be? A trouser button? It might be delicious and it could be something you like. But will it be useful? Just wait and let the Cracker’s delight surprise you! Almost sold out! Yet it still comes with the speed of light! The now reduced Anthology pack consists of three A3 demo posters, one Thalion postcard (chosen from 4 motifs), the Laptop sticker and the double-sided Chrome Edition bookmarks. Upgrade your pledges with the Power Pack and/or the Digital PDF/Album.

<p><strong>WHO IS MYRA GOLDICK</strong></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Myra Goldick. I am physically challenged.  We live in a world full of glorious beauty. Yet, many of us are on a perpetual quest for perfection. Unfortunately, perfection ... in its raw form ... is unattainable. As human beings we are constantly searching for perfection within ourselves,both inwardly and outwardly. Sadly, occasionally we mistakenly judge others prematurely. Those among us who are challenged with either visible or invisible disabilities are frequently labeled and prejudged by the stigma of the word disabled, and viewed as less than perfect. Are you aware that the disabled community is one of fastest growing minorities on the planet today? Shockingly it is a community that anyone can become a part of at any moment. That statistic is a sobering reality to many of us and a reality that creates great discomfort and fear in our hearts.</p>
<p> <strong>THE PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p>We have come a long way since I became paralyzed by polio in 1953. However, we still have a long way to go until we see the person first, with his or her own unique talents and abilities that can be of great value to society, before we see the disability and make assumptions. I have traveled this road since the age of ten and struggled with the label disabled and even categorized as crippled. I have learned a lot along my journey of tears and perseverance. I am grateful for the generosity and help I received along my path to recovery. The March of Dimes paid for my rehabilitation when I was a little girl. With their help I learned to dance on my disabilities. Currently, the March Of Dimes supports the research for the eradication of birth defects. It is for that reason I am donating 5% of any funds raised with this campaign directly to them to aid their cause.Why should any child suffer, if we can possibly prevent it? I have discovered that anything is possible until we say it's not, and learning to Dance on Your Disabilities is the key to a life full of happiness and joy. I could never have achieved the success in my life I have experienced without the love and support of my caregivers.   First my mother and then my husband of 50 years. They are the unsung heroes that never  get recognition for their unyielding loyalty. My mission is to make a positive difference in the world and in the lives of one of the fastest growing minorities in the world, the disabled. I want to celebrate their caregivers, loving families, and their workplace associates who accommodate their needs in the spirit of love and support. Visible or invisible disabilities do not define the worth of an individual or their value to society. Education is the key.</p>
<p><strong>THE GOAL</strong></p>
<p>It is for this reason that I am writing the book ""Dancing on Your Disabilities, Never Say Impossible to Your Dreams"". Within the pages of my book I tell my story in an effort to inspire by example, to spread happiness throughout the world, and to motivate others to ""Never Say Impossible to Their Dreams"".  I want to see others  tap into their unique creativity to design their future based on desire and not self - imposed limitations or society’s prejudgment of their abilities. It is my way to of giving thanks for all the blessings I have received during my journey as I spread the message of faith and belief with those who are only beginning my journey. I am asking for your support and help to make this book become a reality. Chances are you already know or love someone with a challenge. Perhaps it's you who is suffering and feels like giving up. Giving up is not an option. If you find it in your heart please help me put this book in the hands of all those who are in a dark lonely place, whether they are the caregiver or the challenged. Together we can make a difference in the world. We are not alone. A Special <strong>Thank you </strong>to all the corporations and businesses that have offered opportunities and will continue to offer career options  for the challenged to contribute to society and become independent.</p>
<p><strong>I AM ETERNALLY GRATEFUL TO THE MARCH OF DIMES</strong></p>
<p> I will donate an additional 10% for the first six months of all book sales of "" Dancing On Your Disabilities/Never Say Impossible to Your Dreams to the<strong> March of Dimes.</strong></p>

<h3><u>The Impact:  From on the ground in Peru</u></h3>
<p>   <font size=""3"">Unless you live in the Peruvian Andes among the children and their families it is hard to imagine the severity of their poverty. Picture waking up in the morning in an adobe house, without heat. Perhaps there is no running water or electricity. Corrugated aluminum roofs held down with old tires and no bathroom. Many children are pulled out of school at early ages to help the family tend the land. Teenage pregnancies are common, swirling the poverty cycle into the next generation. The indigenous people have few opportunities to advance themselves. </font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">   The victims are the children who can not do anything to help themselves. At Changes for New Hope, we see the impact we are making but so much more needs to happen before we can claim victory. <br/></font></p>
</div>
<h3>
<u>Here's what we need and this is what you will receive for helping</u>  <font size=""3""> </font>

<p>   <font size=""3"">It is my sincere hope that this writing project raises far more than $8000. I have goals and plans that will require many times that amount. However, let's use this number as a starting point.</font></p>

<p><font size=""3"">   Absolutely! Changes for New Hope was a new, unheard of project at its inception in 2009.

<h3>Jim Killon, Changes for New Hope</h3>
<p>   In 2009, Jim Killon moved to Peru, where he started a nonprofit organization to help impoverished children in the Peruvian Andes. With no funding and no Spanish, everyone told him to give up and go home. Three years later, Changes for New Hope has reached hundreds of children and helped change their despair into real hope.</p>

<h4>About Jim</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p><em>By Laura Weiss</em></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>   After twenty years of working in sales, Baltimore native Jim Killon was so moved by the poverty in South America that he spent his life savings to start an organization to improve the livelihood of Peruvian children and permanently relocated to Huaraz, Peru.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>   When he first arrived in Peru in 2009, Jim was not intending to start his own organization. But when he began working as a volunteer coordinator at an NGO, he was immediately disappointed with the way the organization was run. Disillusioned with the corrupt way funds were allocated and the volunteers who seemed more interested in partying than helping, Jim decided that he needed to do more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  ""I was not content to help a handful of children with their homework and send them on their way…These children wore rags; shoes were literally falling off their feet. They were suffering from malnutrition. Their hair felt like straw,"" Jim recalls.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>   So in 2009 he began <a href=""http://www.changesfornewhope.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u><font color=""#4f9800"">Changes for New Hope</font></u></a>, a nonprofit organization focused on providing Peruvian youth opportunities and hope for a better future. ""We had to start from scratch,"" he says. ""Respect for themselves and each other became part of the program. Those who arrived simply for the hand-outs left as soon as they realized this was more than a give-away program. We were left with children who wanted to develop themselves into young men and women one day.""</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>   As a start-up nonprofit in a foreign country, Jim faced challenges that to most people would seem insurmountable. ""I had no idea how to read a menu or make a phone call,"" he says. ""The culture and customs were all alien to me. When people told me they eat guinea pigs as food I thought they were kidding. When I found a chicken foot in my soup I was sure it was a prank... I was told I could never succeed.""</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>   For Jim, the solution to the challenges he faced was passion. ""My tenacity drew others to the project and we developed a solid base,"" he says. ""Spanish can be learned, obstacles can be overcome. Naysayers go silent in the face of determination and success.""</p>
<p>Jim spoke at language centers and universities in Peru to encourage more people to donate and volunteer for the cause. Local poster campaigns and testimonials from previous volunteers helped the project gain credibility and fodder.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>  Jim's passion is obvious to everyone around him. According to Marlie Ferron, a former volunteer with Changes for New Hope, local Huaraz residents refer to him as ""Crazy Jim.""</p>
<p>""Not crazy as in psychopath or lunatic, or out of his mind, but crazy as in one in a million who dropped his life in the United States to come to Peru and just do his best with what he could, no questions asked,"" Marlie writes on the <a href=""http://www.changesfornewhope.org/1/post/2011/02/marlies-volunteer-experience-at-changes-for-new-hope.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u><font color=""#4f9800"">CNH blog</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>  Whereas three years ago, Jim's life was about the big-city grind, he now spends his days teaching children about <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=174599972582393&amp;set=pu.149294115112979&amp;type=1&amp;theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u><font color=""#4f9800"">the nature that surrounds them</font></u></a> and facilitating games of <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=163900960318961&amp;set=pu.149294115112979&amp;type=1&amp;theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u><font color=""#4f9800"">""Gringo Bingo,""</font></u></a> an English vocabulary game. He does <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=197367786972278&amp;set=pu.149294115112979&amp;type=1&amp;theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u><font color=""#4f9800"">art projects</font></u></a> with the children, some of whom have never been able to draw with crayons and paper before.</p>
<p>At its inception, Changes for New Hope only reached one group of children, but now Jim works with three groups – about 90 children total. And that number is constantly growing. The program continually adapts to the different teaching styles and hobbies of its volunteers. Jim notes, ""Each volunteer has some skill or ability that the children have yet to experience or try. The children are eager learners now and embrace new faces.""</p>
<p>With the invaluable assistance of volunteers from the US, the UK, Australia and more, Changes for New Hope is able to add new ideas, projects, learning games and choices as materials and donations allow.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>  Jim hopes that in future years, Changes for New Hope will be able to engage Peruvian families to create sustainable business models to raise themselves out of poverty. He hopes that future generations will be able to give their children more than they had as a result of Changes for New Hope. ""Mostly, I am happy to see that, while poverty continues, the desperation mentality is slowly melting away… When people realize opportunities are available, hope replaces despair,"" he says.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>  It is clear that Jim's life has changed as a result of moving to Peru. He lost 60 pounds after living on a Peruvian diet. He's forgotten what ""turning on the heat"" means. He hasn't driven a car in almost three years. But Jim wouldn't call these changes sacrifices.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>  ""I think that had I ever viewed it as a sacrifice, I may have been tempted to throw in the towel and head for a beach in Hawaii,"" he says. ""The reward for me was seeing the results and development of the children and their families.""</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>Jim's multifaceted efforts have transformed his life, but he describes it as a ""win-win endeavor"" that has opened his heart to the beauty and reward that comes from helping others.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p> ""No one is telling me to go home anymore,"" he notes. ""This is home for me now.""</p>

<h3><u>Other Ways You Can Help</u></h3>
<p>   There are many ways to further the project at Changes for New Hope and the publication and production of this book. Share us on Facebook, and other social media outlets, with your friends and suggest they share it as well. You can become a ""Virtual Volunteer"" right from your own home by supporting, sponsoring a child, fundraising, sending down materials and supplies, and spreading the word. </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>   You can also come to visit us here in Huaraz Peru as an ""On-The-Ground-Volunteer"" and experience our day to day life, working in the villages we go to, meet the families and children and make a hands-on difference with us. Those who have volunteered with us have dispelled their pre-conceived ideas, renewed their faith in human kind, and come away with a deep feeling of accomplishment. One wonderful family actually blew off a cruise to Barbados to come volunteer with us. They left with no regrets and with great memories of their experience.  </p>

</div></div>","A quick introduction of the author      Hi everybody, I'm Jim Killon. I am an American from Baltimore, Maryland. In 2009, I cameto Peru and started a project called Changes for New Hope. It was designed to help the children livinghere in extreme poverty. We address issues such as malnutrition and hunger, education, self esteemand other emotional issues, family crisis, general well being and creativity development projects. Our growth is happening faster than our funding so... I decided to write this childrens story book.
    I am an avid writer. I have a blog at jimkillon@blogspot.com which you may enjoy reading. I have also written several articles and commentaries for e-publications such as Itsonehumanity.org, Youthemovement.org, Expatperu.com, Livinginperu.com, Omprakash.org, the Baltimore Sun, as well as on our own webpage at www.changesfornewhope.org. 
  
   This childrens storybook will contain five stories that have moral imperatives to teach your children. Sharing, integrity, honesty and compassion to name a few. Due to be available in mid-2012 in e-form and print copy version, I feel that these stories that inspire the children of Changes for New Hope will also have a significant meaning to your children as well. 

The Impact:  From on the ground in Peru
   Unless you live in the Peruvian Andes among the children and their families it is hard to imagine the severity of their poverty. Picture waking up in the morning in an adobe house, without heat. Perhaps there is no running water or electricity. Corrugated aluminum roofs held down with old tires and no bathroom. Many children are pulled out of school at early ages to help the family tend the land. Teenage pregnancies are common, swirling the poverty cycle into the next generation. The indigenous people have few opportunities to advance themselves. 
   The victims are the children who can not do anything to help themselves. At Changes for New Hope, we see the impact we are making but so much more needs to happen before we can claim victory. 


Here's what we need and this is what you will receive for helping   

   It is my sincere hope that this writing project raises far more than $8000. I have goals and plans that will require many times that amount. However, let's use this number as a starting point.
 
    So, how is the money being used? Why should I help children way down there in Peru? What do I get in return?
   
   All good questions. 
   * To begin with, I will get the book published, printed, illustrated and marketed which will use some of the funds. 
   * Next, we want to put food in the bellies of every child. Until hunger and malnutrition is arrested, nothing much else is going to be useful. We need childrens vitamins to suppliment the scant diets of these children.
  *  Protein rich foods and a daily balanced diet are urgent issues we are addressing.
  *  If you have ever worn a pair of ill fitting shoes you know how your body feels at the end of a day. 
Imagine wearing ragged worn out laceless shoes everyday. Shoes last about one rainy season here in Peru. Families can not afford new shoes so the children wear shoes that are literally falling off their feet.
   * Educational materials and school supplies are desperately needed. Notebooks, pens, pencils, paper, colored pencils, erasers, sharpeners and rulers do not come easily to the children. School uniforms are required to attend school. Some children do not get an education because their families can not afford the uniforms. Education is the easiest, cheapest and most effective avenue out of poverty. 
   * Part of your contribution will also help to support our dedicated volunteers who are diligently working toward bringing about these changes.
   * Health issues among the children are rampant. They suffer from parasites, worm infestations, vision problems, lacking dental and pediatric care and emotional/psychological issues. Health care is a human right but doesn't always extend this far up into the Peruvian Andes, sadly enough.
 
   What do you get for your contribution? 
   Of course the great perks that you see on the right column of this campaign, but there is a more intrinsic reward. You will feel the personal satisfaction and warm feeling that somewhere in the high mountains of Peru, there are children who will have a hope, a ray of sunshine knowing that their tomorrow will be so much better than their todays. That is a major reason I am committed to staying right here and see this project through. There is no finish line for me.
 
   Am I putting my money where my mouth is? 
   Absolutely! Changes for New Hope was a new, unheard of project at its inception in 2009. No one was going to support a project they never heard of, in a place no one has ever seen, by a guy who was completely unknown.

                                                ****  An Excerpt From A Story In The Book  ****

 
                                                                   The Winged Crawlers
 

    “If only I had a pair of beautiful wings like all the other Nadas, I could learn to fly. I could fly to other mountaintops, higher mountaintops and see new things I never saw before. I could fly so high that I would be able to see the glaciers from above the mountains.” That idea excited Frio very much. “Why do my friends not use their beautiful wings and fly?” He wondered, “Why do they not use their beautiful wings to discover new things so far away and so high? Why do they not visit far away places that they would no long have to crawl to go to?” He was very confused, “They have beautiful wings, why do they not use them?” Frio was very curious, very curious indeed.
   One day Frio was huddled in a group of his friends and they were happy , all licking their favorite treat, frozen glacier icicles. Frio asked a very important question, which he had thought about all night long. “Nadas, my friends, I have seen each of you with very beautiful wings on your backs, with many colors and they are large enough that if you fluttered them, like when you get excited, and maybe jumped at the same time, you might just be able to fly!” The other Nadas looked at Frio in disbelief, but Frio continued, “Imagine the possibilities, imagine what you could see if you could fly high up in the air. You would no longer have to drag yourselves from place to place when you walked.” It made perfect sense to Frio and he only wished he also had wings to fly himself to show them. He closed his eyes and imagined flying over the glaciers and mountains. He imagined himself looking down into valleys with his big blue eyes and seeing so many new things that no one had ever seen before.                                                **********************************************

About Jim


By Laura Weiss
  
   After twenty years of working in sales, Baltimore native Jim Killon was so moved by the poverty in South America that he spent his life savings to start an organization to improve the livelihood of Peruvian children and permanently relocated to Huaraz, Peru.
  
   When he first arrived in Peru in 2009, Jim was not intending to start his own organization. But when he began working as a volunteer coordinator at an NGO, he was immediately disappointed with the way the organization was run. Disillusioned with the corrupt way funds were allocated and the volunteers who seemed more interested in partying than helping, Jim decided that he needed to do more.
 
  ""I was not content to help a handful of children with their homework and send them on their way…These children wore rags; shoes were literally falling off their feet. They were suffering from malnutrition. Their hair felt like straw,"" Jim recalls.
 
   So in 2009 he began Changes for New Hope, a nonprofit organization focused on providing Peruvian youth opportunities and hope for a better future. ""We had to start from scratch,"" he says. ""Respect for themselves and each other became part of the program. Those who arrived simply for the hand-outs left as soon as they realized this was more than a give-away program. We were left with children who wanted to develop themselves into young men and women one day.""
  
   As a start-up nonprofit in a foreign country, Jim faced challenges that to most people would seem insurmountable. ""I had no idea how to read a menu or make a phone call,"" he says. ""The culture and customs were all alien to me. When people told me they eat guinea pigs as food I thought they were kidding. When I found a chicken foot in my soup I was sure it was a prank... I was told I could never succeed.""
   
   For Jim, the solution to the challenges he faced was passion. ""My tenacity drew others to the project and we developed a solid base,"" he says. ""Spanish can be learned, obstacles can be overcome. Naysayers go silent in the face of determination and success.""
Jim spoke at language centers and universities in Peru to encourage more people to donate and volunteer for the cause. Local poster campaigns and testimonials from previous volunteers helped the project gain credibility and fodder.
  
  Jim's passion is obvious to everyone around him. According to Marlie Ferron, a former volunteer with Changes for New Hope, local Huaraz residents refer to him as ""Crazy Jim.""
""Not crazy as in psychopath or lunatic, or out of his mind, but crazy as in one in a million who dropped his life in the United States to come to Peru and just do his best with what he could, no questions asked,"" Marlie writes on the CNH blog.
  
  Whereas three years ago, Jim's life was about the big-city grind, he now spends his days teaching children about the nature that surrounds them and facilitating games of ""Gringo Bingo,"" an English vocabulary game. He does art projects with the children, some of whom have never been able to draw with crayons and paper before.
At its inception, Changes for New Hope only reached one group of children, but now Jim works with three groups – about 90 children total. And that number is constantly growing. The program continually adapts to the different teaching styles and hobbies of its volunteers. Jim notes, ""Each volunteer has some skill or ability that the children have yet to experience or try. The children are eager learners now and embrace new faces.""
With the invaluable assistance of volunteers from the US, the UK, Australia and more, Changes for New Hope is able to add new ideas, projects, learning games and choices as materials and donations allow.

He hopes that future generations will be able to give their children more than they had as a result of Changes for New Hope. ""Mostly, I am happy to see that, while poverty continues, the desperation mentality is slowly melting away… When people realize opportunities are available, hope replaces despair,"" he says.
  
  It is clear that Jim's life has changed as a result of moving to Peru. He lost 60 pounds after living on a Peruvian diet. He's forgotten what ""turning on the heat"" means. He hasn't driven a car in almost three years. But Jim wouldn't call these changes sacrifices.
  
  ""I think that had I ever viewed it as a sacrifice, I may have been tempted to throw in the towel and head for a beach in Hawaii,"" he says. ""The reward for me was seeing the results and development of the children and their families.""
   
Jim's multifaceted efforts have transformed his life, but he describes it as a ""win-win endeavor"" that has opened his heart to the beauty and reward that comes from helping others.
  
 ""No one is telling me to go home anymore,"" he notes. ""This is home for me now.""

Other Ways You Can Help
   There are many ways to further the project at Changes for New Hope and the publication and production of this book. Share us on Facebook, and other social media outlets, with your friends and suggest they share it as well. You can become a ""Virtual Volunteer"" right from your own home by supporting, sponsoring a child, fundraising, sending down materials and supplies, and spreading the word. 
   
   You can also come to visit us here in Huaraz Peru as an ""On-The-Ground-Volunteer"" and experience our day to day life, working in the villages we go to, meet the families and children and make a hands-on difference with us. Those who have volunteered with us have dispelled their pre-conceived ideas, renewed their faith in human kind, and come away with a deep feeling of accomplishment. One wonderful family actually blew off a cruise to Barbados to come volunteer with us. They left with no regrets and with great memories of their experience.

<p><strong>Talking Shop</strong> will be an online community of writers where members can experience the various facets of the writing life- business aspects, workshops, and camaraderie and commiseration- all in one place.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><em>Why?</em></h3>
<p>My transition from writing as a hobby to writing professionally was a rough one. At the time I lived in a very rural area without a writing community so I turned to online writing groups. Over the past 7½ years I have belonged to several. Each community had a specific focus. One focused largely on the business side of the writing life, such as how to query an agent. The second was a gathering place for writing mothers and there I found emotional support whenever a toddler meltdown ruined my precious writing time. The last group focused almost exclusively on workshop model and my writing greatly improved as a result.</p>
<p>However, meeting my writing needs in so many different places proved problematic; it was a chore. I've longed for a single online literary home. Other writers have, too. When I wasn't able to find one, I decided to create <strong>Talking Shop</strong>.</p>
<p>Combining the best aspects of the online writing communities to which I’ve belonged, a single visit to <strong>Talking Shop</strong> will enable a writer to learn about the business aspect of writing, get a piece workshopped by their chosen writing group, and be part of a community that is “soft place to fall.” In addition, <strong>Talking Shop</strong> will be able to grow, expand, and adapt to the various needs of its members.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><em>How?</em></h3>
<p>In order to accomplish <strong>Talking Shop</strong>’s various goals, we need a sophisticated forum software platform and a semi-dedicated server to handle the expected traffic. The software costs $285 and a month of server space runs over $60. To enable to group to get on its feet, I’m asking for one year’s worth webhosting or approximately $1000. This brings <strong>Talking Shop</strong>’s total goal to $1250.</p>
<p>If <strong>Talking Shop</strong> exceeds its fundraising goal, extra funds will provide forum support, extra months of server space, and expanded programs. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Perks!</h3>
