<h3>Hi! I am Andrei and here is <i>Why </i>I do what I do...</h3>
<p>I volunteered for about a year and a half to help educate orphans and abandoned children in placement centers in Bucharest. About 3 months into my volunteering activities, I had the chance to work with this little girl by the name of Christina. She was only 6 at the time. On that day, we had decided we were all going to draw something, and at some point, the entire group agreed to draw hearts.</p>
<p>Christina immediately said ""I don't want to draw because I am not good at it.""</p>
<p>I replied ""But, Chrissy, you haven't even tried.""</p>
<p>""I can't draw hearts. I don't know how.""</p>
<p>""Ok, we'll learn together.""</p>
<p>She agreed, and for the next hour, I taught her step by step, how to draw a heart.</p>
<p>""First you draw half a circle. See? Very good! Now, a second one, next to the other. Now, let's draw an arrow head to bring their ends together.""</p>
<p>She was still struggling, so I took her little hand and guided it so she would learn the motion. Then, I let her do it a few times. It wasn't perfect, but she managed to do it.</p>
<p>She was so excited and happy that she was able to draw a heart all by herself. I just couldn't believe how happy a child can be for something that, to many of us, seems like a mundane task.</p>
<p><strong>And then came the problem...</strong></p>
<p>She took the drawing to her caretaker in the placement center to show her what she had accomplished, and that caretaker immediately started to point out the flaws in her drawing. Little Chrissy was instantly discouraged. It broke my heart.</p>
<p>All that work and for nothing. Or so I thought. Actually, It wasn't for nothing, because in all that negativity, for a few moments little Chrissy tasted hope, fulfillment and joy. Unfortunately, there are thousands of kids just like Chrissy, so I want to give those kids many, many more such moments.</p>
<p><strong>I believe that, if I manage to organise such workshops systematically, at least a few of those kids will be inspired more so than they are torn down, and instead of ending up on the streets when they turn eighteen, they might just find the strength to forge a new path for themselves. It's really up to us to tip this ballance. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>A few things about me</h3>
<p>My name is <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/andrei.pop.30"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Andrei Emanuel Pop</a>, owner of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/varahilart/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Varahil Art</a>, and I disregarded my calling as an artist for the past 12 years. <i>Why?</i> Because, being part of a large family, while my parents did all they could to support us and our dreams, some things just don't go as you would like in life. So, instead of pursuing arts or architecture as I would have wanted, I went to the military high school (which offered a state-funded boarding school program and a good education), then military academy (same system) and then served for the past 3 years. Now, however, it is time to do that which I was built to do: <strong>inspire you through the gifts I was given</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>As an artist</strong>, I work primarily in Adobe Illustrator, but, if this campaign is a success, I will have the time and resources to start learning how to use Adobe Photoshop professionally as well.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of business skills</strong>, I have been involved in a small training and consultancy business for the past 2 years. It was and is my first business and has been quite the journey so far. Additionally, in the fall of 2017 I partook in a 12 week start-up development course, in order to gain even more clarity in what concerns starting a successful business.</p>
<p>So, could I go on this journey alone? Yes. Would it be harder without your help? <i>Definitely Yes</i>. However, whether I can or cannot do this alone is not the point of this campaign. <strong>This journey is about the people in it and what we can achieve</strong> <strong>together</strong>. To some it may sound naive, but I have a vision <i>of a world in which people from all corners of the world make contributions, big and small, to bring about great change.</i> A world in which we truly care about and support each other irrespective of gender, religion or race. So, this campaign also comes as a first step towards achieving this vision.</p>
<h3>What I have accomplished thus far</h3>
<p>Before deciding to initiate this campaign, I had a few small victories. Here is what I was able to achieve up until now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built an initial portfolio, which you can find on my facebook page - <strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/varahilart/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Varahil Art</a></strong>. </li>
<li>Opened a personal store on Society6, that uses my creations and that you can find <strong><a href=""https://society6.com/andrei_pop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a></strong>. </li>
<li>Managed to get my first bigger gig as a creative - drew 26 graphics for the manual of a lifeguard training center (to be published);</li>
<li>Did an array of smaller jobs like tattoo designs, logo designs, training certificate designs, graphics for military badges and so on;</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I am working on currently</h3>
<p>I am currently involved in the following activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>About to finish a 30 day Art challenge, by December 1st, in order to train my creative muscles and my commitment to this life-changing mission;</li>
<li>Still working on my personal website called 'Varahil Art'. I will let you know here in an update once that is up and running, so you can see my portfolio and services in a much neater fashion;</li>
<li>Started working on the online store for the inspiration art hub. We (as in, my partner, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/raluca.georgescu.31"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Raluca</a>, and I) will most likely launch it in January 2019. You can sign up <strong><a href=""https://www.inspirationarthub.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a></strong> to get the email when we are officially open. The store will be initially open for the Romanian market and only later, once our processes are all squared away, will we open a store for international sales (hopefully by the end of the year). However, our services will be available internationally, so that is a plus. Below you can see the logo of the store (also created by yours truly): </li>

<h3>Help me by allowing me to help You</h3>
<p><strong>-The goals-</strong></p>
<p>I need an initial total of $5000. Here is how the $5000 dollars from the campaign will be spent:</p>
<ul>
<li>$3000 will go into 4 months' worth of sustenance - this will allow me to build a strong portfolio as I serve you all for all your pre-orders, and build a pertinent personal brand as an artist. Most importantly, it will offer me the much needed peace of mind that will help me focus completely on creating awesome art to inspire you. Or entertain you. Or both at the same time.</li>
<li>The other $2000 will go into the setup and initial marketing efforts of the online store that will start the inspiration art hub concept, so we can create a long term source of income to support the management and organization of the creative workshops for kids. In order to organize the workshops, we will collaborate with the NGO at which I volunteered, because their team has great situational awareness and can tell us which of the kids would benefit the most from this kind of support.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If the campaign goes beyond the $5000 goal</strong>, I will be splitting the money between supporting myself and supporting the operational and marketing costs of the hub, to jump start it and make it international faster. <strong>However</strong>, if all goes as planned, I will not need any money past the initial $3000 for personal use, because I should have built a decent personal brand and client base by then, so all the extra funds will go into supporting the growth of the online store.</p>
<p>Should the campaign goal not be reached, everything below the first $3000 will go into sustenance. Anything past the $3000 will go into the hub. This is because I will be able to get other projects easier if I have peace of mind and thus, make the rest of the money to support the hub via projects outside the ones dedicated to the backers of this campaign.</p>
<p><strong>-The perks-</strong></p>
<p>Depending on your choices, I can offer you any of the perks present in this campaign. Also, if there is something you had in mind other than what I am offering here, let me know in an email, we will discuss pricing and you can then buy the equivalent perk from the campaign.</p>
<p>I will start offering the services once the campaign ends, on a first-come-first-served basis, and, hopefully, I will have accomplished all of them by the end of August 2019, at the latest. Generally, for perks such as logo, certificate and letter designs, I will be creating 3 initial concepts and you will have 2 revision sessions for each perk. Anything past that will involve an additional fee equal to 20% of the base price for the perk. As such, good communication will be of utmost importance.</p>
<p>As far as the physical product perks are concerned, our intent is to have you get those just in time for the next holiday season. I say ""our"" because I have a team with which I am working on developing the hub.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While my goal is to fulfill all the services by the end of August 2019, I find it more important that each of you receive an artistic work that truly inspires and satisfies you. On this note, I will ask that you be patient with me if, by some chance, I do not succeed in meeting this deadline. I don't think that will be the case though, since, so far at least, I have been able to finish all my graphic design projects ahead of schedule, but a word of warning never hurts.</p>
<p>As far as the online store is concerned, developing the infrastructure for this business has proven to be quite a challenge. I am certain it will be a success in time, but, if by some chance we will not meet our intended deadlines, I will contact each backer to discuss win-win solutions. My partner, as well as our collaborators for production and marketing are really good at what they do though, so I am fairly confident in our ability to meet our goal of delivering the products just in time for your next holiday season.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Here are some things you can do if you can't help as a backer:</p>
<p>1) Tell at least 3 friends who might be interested in these products and services;</p>
<p>2) If you already own an online store and want to help me get an edge in this industry, I would be happy to seek your counsel;</p>
<p>3) Share this campaign on your social media accounts via the share buttons. The more people hear about this, the better the chance of meeting our goals!</p>
<p>Again, thank you so much for taking the time to read these lines and for your support! It means a lot to me and I will make sure to make it mean a whole lot more to a whole lot of other people.</p>
<p>I look forward to serving you!</p>

Ikke en frisør, men en salon med kunst! Der findes så meget fedt kunst i verdenen. Det ses dog, at kulturen, i dag, ofte er rettet mod en bestemt genre og platformene er typisk bestemt af de mere veletablerede udstillere, eller kunstnere, der har netværket til at kunne bryde igennem. Det er her vi vil gøre en forskel! Vi vil støtte op om alle de kunstnere som ikke selv har netværket, økonomien eller redskaberne til at blive set og hørt! =====================================================Gennem vores, nu 3 års, erfaringer med afvikling af hhv. pop-up udstillinger, kortfilmsprojekter og kunstfestivaler, har vi gang på gang oplevet behovet for en større repræsentation af nutidens kunst, som tilmed vil være let tilgængelig for beskueren, såvel som for kunstneren. Derfor vil vi nu samle al vores erfaring i ét sted - Salon Monday... Vi skaber et hybridgalleri til udstilling af kunsten, i alle dens afskygninger. En kreativ, intim og inspirerende boble, lokaliseret i København. Her er enhver velkommen til, helt uformelt og helt gratis, at komme ind og fordybe sig i kunsten. En multidisciplinær kunst- & kulturbar, hvor kunstnerne kan udstille, fortælle, optræde og, generelt set, få en platform,der kan moduleres til netop deres kunst. Hvorfor støtte vores kampagne? Vi er godt på vej i hele processen med at åbne denne Salon, men vi mangler stadig din hjælp til at komme helt i mål. Hver en krone (€) vi kan samle ind i støtte her, skal vi ikke låne til i banken. Så vi håber du har lyst til at bidrage til vores projekt, ved at købe én af vores perks. Vi garanterer, at de kommer mangefold igen. Men det kræver selvfølgelig, at vi når 100% finansiering inden kampagnens udløb. Støtter du vores Indiegogo er du med til at finansiere: Indskuddet på lokalerne. Byggematerialer til stole, borde - disse er færdigudviklede og klar til produktion. Sceneudstyr til koncerter, talks og andre spændende events. Og lys - så du kan se hvad, der egentlig sker!  P.S. Kan du li' vores idé? Så vil vi være super taknemmelig, hvis du vil dele dette opslag med dine venner på Facebook eller Twitter.  Hvad er Salon Monday?  Vores Lokale Kreative Helte...! Vi har allieret os med 10 lokale kunstnere, vores såkaldte lokale kreative helte, der alle har støttet op om vores projekt, ved at donere deres værker til kampagnen.Ved at støtte vores kickstarter kan du derfor få fingrene i værker fra:  ===================================================== Vores Perks.. =======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================Hvordan får jeg min perk?Når kampagnen er fuldt finansieret (100% eller mere), sender vi information til den email, du har brugt ved købet med en dato for hvornår, din perk er ses at være nået frem, med posten.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Vin Tabone, Managing Director of VJT Productions, LLC.   VJT was formed to produce films that are educational, inspirational, and healing.  I am also the Producer of the PBS documentary: The Hudson River School: Artistic Pioneers (Part 1).  Prior to film-making I was Director of Licensing for Sony Music in New York.  After many years at Sony I turned the next chapter to something familiar and dear to my heart, something that still inspires me today and causes me to stop, focus, and tune out the rest of the world - the artists and artwork of The Hudson River School.  These artists provide a varied, and colorful commentary on 19th century life, and the challenges that encompassed its time.   Like many of us they were concerned about the world they lived in, the environment, their country, the future, religion, and the direction of an America they valued deeply.  They conveyed their thoughts, opinions, and creative expression the only way they knew how - through their brilliant artwork.  Majestic mountains, rugged wilderness, clear running streams, bucolic landscapes, mighty rivers, jungles and icebergs, these all had an impact on the men of The Hudson River School.  They also spoke of conservation, preservation, protection of our natural resources, and held a religious reverence for the land.  The resulting artwork would form a unique national identity that would fill museums around the world.  This series is a journey - and I'd love for you to come along so we can take this journey together!  By contributing you'll be keeping their story, and the mission behind their message alive.  By contributing you'll also be supporting art education...here's one way how:  PBS Distribution will make this film digitally available to high school classrooms, colleges and universities through their PBS Learning Media Program.  Millions of students will benefit intellectually and emotionally by this program.  By contributing you will also be providing relief to millions who are in desperate need of repose from the constant bombardment of today's negative, fear-filled media.  A film like The Hudson River School will take the viewer away from all of that.  Cultivating a Tradition will be 53 minutes of peaceful, soothing landscapes, beautiful vistas, calming scenes, and illustrious beams of luminous sunlight.  The message here is positive, thought-provoking, reflective, and spiritually and emotionally uplifting.  Something we all need right now.  </p>
<p>We have had generous contributors - but we still need a total of $15,000 to get the production of the Hudson River School Part 2 off the ground.   This money will go toward legal fees, insurance costs, licensing fees, equipment rentals, voice-over talent, and filming and editing production costs.   <i><strong>If we don't reach our goal all money will be refunded to those generous individuals and organizations that contributed.</strong></i> </p>
<p>Our perks include an autographed DVD of the documentary by the producer, postcards of the movie promo image which contains Sanford Gifford's, ""A Gorge in the Mountains,"" a special thanks in the film credits, a 11 X 17 inch autographed poster (suitable for framing and depicting the DVD cover - see above images) of the beautiful movie promo image of ""A Gorge in the Mountains,"" even dinner in the Hudson River Valley or New York City area with the producer! </p>
<p>The Impact of The Hudson River School series has been impressive, and our PBS television distributor and PBS Distribution have both committed, in writing, to distribute Part 2 when it is completed.  A need exists for this kind of programming.  This amounts to millions of viewers and consumers nationwide who will enjoy this film.  The documentary will make its way to museum gift shops (like the one at The National Gallery in Washington, where Artistic Pioneers recently sold out), major libraries like The New York Public Library, Amazon.com, Best Buy, Barnes &amp; Noble, Netflix, shoppbs.org, and youtube..their reach is vast so many can enjoy this production! </p>
</div><div>
<p>The challenge we face to reach our goal is real, there are many worthy causes that need funding, but the reward for contributing - whatever you can give - is great!  Supporting the arts and the inspiring story of our indigenous culture is invaluable.  This is something worth fighting for so we all can continue to learn, grow, and become culturally enlightened about the world we live in.  We overcame many obstacles producing, Part 1 ""Artistic Pioneers,"" but, at the end of the day The Metropolitan Museum of Art joined the fight and helped, as did The New-York Historical Society and many other major foundations and organizations such as the Thomas Cole National Historic Site.  And many of these organizations are already on board for Part 2, like The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Wadsworth Atheneum, The Thomas Cole National Historic Site, The Newington-Cropsey Foundation, The Gladys Kreible Delmas Foundation, and many others.   It's also worth fighting for because art education benefits our future generations greatly.  Here's how:  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The NORM Arts Collective, designed by NORM Enterprise is a network of artists, producers, songwriters, videographers, and other talented individuals from Ottawa’s diverse art community founded in 2016. We aim to provide a platform for both established and upcoming artists to produce and showcase their talents through collaboration and mentorship within our collective. We intend to accomplish our goals with the introduction of <strong>“The Ingenuity project”</strong>.</p>
<p><i>""Ingenuity: the quality of being inventive and original.""</i></p>
<p>Some highlights from NORM’s 5-year history have been our 8 musical showcase events which featured artists from within our collective and supported a charity run by one of our own members to support orphanages, schools, and hospitals in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Additionally, NORM has provided services and networking to produce more than 20 single releases and 5 albums for our various artists.</p>
<p>NORM is continuously expanding and we are doing this by introducing our very own Merchandise Store called “Inner Peace Clothing” which caters to spiritual and mental wellness hoping to create a positive atmosphere in our community.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this campaign important to us?</strong></p>
<p>The campaign is crucial to us because it will help us tackle our objectives in different levels presented as follows.</p> <p><u>Community:</u> We are looking to build a strong foundation of Arts in our community, looking to promote local talents and set a positive trend in the mainstream media. We cater to artists from every background including people of colour, people with special needs and the LGBTQ community.</p>
<p><u>Mentorship:</u> providing artist-to artist learning opportunities in production, songwriting, photography and videography, etc. We are looking to provide learning and mentoring opportunities for the upcoming local artist within our community who could use a helping hand to guide them as they progress on their artistic journey.</p>
<p><u>Charity:</u> We are looking to partner with local charity organizations to ensure mental wellness, help provide food and clothing to homeless shelters and create an environment of hope by initiating programs that would create an opportunity for the homeless to earn a living and have a stable and continuous income. </p>
<p><u>Inner Peace Clothing:</u> We are looking to start and grow our very merch store called “Inner Peace Clothing” which caters to spiritual and mental wellness. We intend to do this by continuously evolving artistically, coming up with creative designs that are appealing to the public, and catering to the needs of our society in order to generate passive income for our company which will be invested back into our programs to help our community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your contribution would help us immensely in our pursuit to create a stronger and more connected artistic community in Ottawa. This will include helping us to:</li>
<li>Hold bigger and better showcases raising awareness for both our collective and the causes that we support.</li>
<li>Launch of our upcoming merchandise line and shop.</li>
<li>Continue to provide a platform and support to our collective members, bringing business to Ottawa’s artistic service providers and music-adjacent professionals.</li>
<li>Continue to support charitable causes close to our members’ hearts, as well as other members of our community.</li>
<li>Give a platform to members of our community to produce and release their unique work.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Funding</strong></p>
<p>We are asking for the sum of $65,000 (CAD), which will be invested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buying musical equipment and improving our current inventory of gears, supporting local artists in studio production, live performances, and authentic music visuals.</li>
<li>Buying photography and cinematography equipment to cater to the artistic needs of our community.</li>
<li>Investing in artistic programs to help promote local talents and set them up on a successful route.</li>
<li>Partnering with local and international businesses to shed more light on our community.</li>
<li>Partnering with media and marketing experts to grow our collective to a point where it’s financially self-reliant.</li>
<li>Growing our merchandise store with the latest trends while maintaining the NORM message so we can be more influential and effective.</li>
<li>Hosting mentorship workshops featuring established local artists to provide guidance to younger artists.</li>
<li>Supporting the releases of artists in our collective.</li>
<li>Expansion in order to take our creative talents to other cities via tours.</li>
<li>Creating a bedrock of hope in our community by continuously partnering with local charities.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a detailed Business Plan that contains an in-depth report on us, our needs, our goals and what we intend to accomplish which can be made available to contributors and investors upon request.</p>
<p>We are a collective made up of an extremely diverse community! Our membership is largely made up of individuals of colour, and we provide a space for people to share their unique cultural influences and experiences with one another. </p>
<p>A unique feature of our collective is that through inter-artist collaboration, we have created opportunities for mentorship and education for our artists. If an artist intends to engage in self-improvement and skill-building programs, we offer them support in pursuing their passions.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The NORM Arts Collective, designed by NORM Enterprise is a network of artists, producers, songwriters, videographers, and other talented individuals from Ottawa’s diverse art community founded in 2016. We aim to provide a platform for both established and upcoming artists to produce and showcase their talents through collaboration and mentorship within our collective. We intend to accomplish our goals with the introduction of “The Ingenuity project”.
""Ingenuity: the quality of being inventive and original.""
Some highlights from NORM’s 5-year history have been our 8 musical showcase events which featured artists from within our collective and supported a charity run by one of our own members to support orphanages, schools, and hospitals in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Additionally, NORM has provided services and networking to produce more than 20 single releases and 5 albums for our various artists.
NORM is continuously expanding and we are doing this by introducing our very own Merchandise Store called “Inner Peace Clothing” which caters to spiritual and mental wellness hoping to create a positive atmosphere in our community.
Why is this campaign important to us?
The campaign is crucial to us because it will help us tackle our objectives in different levels presented as follows. Community: We are looking to build a strong foundation of Arts in our community, looking to promote local talents and set a positive trend in the mainstream media. We cater to artists from every background including people of colour, people with special needs and the LGBTQ community.
Mentorship: providing artist-to artist learning opportunities in production, songwriting, photography and videography, etc. We are looking to provide learning and mentoring opportunities for the upcoming local artist within our community who could use a helping hand to guide them as they progress on their artistic journey.
Charity: We are looking to partner with local charity organizations to ensure mental wellness, help provide food and clothing to homeless shelters and create an environment of hope by initiating programs that would create an opportunity for the homeless to earn a living and have a stable and continuous income. 
Inner Peace Clothing: We are looking to start and grow our very merch store called “Inner Peace Clothing” which caters to spiritual and mental wellness. We intend to do this by continuously evolving artistically, coming up with creative designs that are appealing to the public, and catering to the needs of our society in order to generate passive income for our company which will be invested back into our programs to help our community.

Your contribution would help us immensely in our pursuit to create a stronger and more connected artistic community in Ottawa. This will include helping us to:
Hold bigger and better showcases raising awareness for both our collective and the causes that we support.
Launch of our upcoming merchandise line and shop.
Continue to provide a platform and support to our collective members, bringing business to Ottawa’s artistic service providers and music-adjacent professionals.
Continue to support charitable causes close to our members’ hearts, as well as other members of our community.
Give a platform to members of our community to produce and release their unique work.

 

What We Need & What You Get
Funding
We are asking for the sum of $65,000 (CAD), which will be invested in:

Buying musical equipment and improving our current inventory of gears, supporting local artists in studio production, live performances, and authentic music visuals.
Buying photography and cinematography equipment to cater to the artistic needs of our community.
Investing in artistic programs to help promote local talents and set them up on a successful route.
Partnering with local and international businesses to shed more light on our community.
Partnering with media and marketing experts to grow our collective to a point where it’s financially self-reliant.
Growing our merchandise store with the latest trends while maintaining the NORM message so we can be more influential and effective.
Hosting mentorship workshops featuring established local artists to provide guidance to younger artists.
Supporting the releases of artists in our collective.
Expansion in order to take our creative talents to other cities via tours.
Creating a bedrock of hope in our community by continuously partnering with local charities.

We have a detailed Business Plan that contains an in-depth report on us, our needs, our goals and what we intend to accomplish which can be made available to contributors and investors upon request.
We are a collective made up of an extremely diverse community! Our membership is largely made up of individuals of colour, and we provide a space for people to share their unique cultural influences and experiences with one another. 
A unique feature of our collective is that through inter-artist collaboration, we have created opportunities for mentorship and education for our artists. If an artist intends to engage in self-improvement and skill-building programs, we offer them support in pursuing their passions.
 Finally, a major success within our collective has been the creation of a registered charity by one of our members — Umoja, which supports orphanages, schools, and hospitals in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. We have been able to give their charity a platform for fundraising through our showcase events. 
Given that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted artists all over the world, and their ability to succeed during this especially trying time, we intend to direct any funds received to the most effective and appropriate projects that our artists can engage with while we remain on lockdown. This means that we will be prioritizing the production of musical releases over showcase planning, as well as investing in our upcoming merchandise line and store in order to be more financially independent and to generate passive income.

<p>     I'm Mykelle. I'm an artist and aerial performer that has started an aerial arts program in Twin Falls, Idaho. <br/>     I have been performing aerial arts for one year this summer.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In most cases contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to know about the campaign and the people involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Producer “Young Fresh Of Book Smart” and Musician “Jessie E.McGriff” started the Book Smart Records LLC In early 2019 and later singer “Jake Ryan” joined the team as a member.</li>
<li>The Road To Glory campaign is about utilizing the support of the public to elevate a standard LLC to not only an innovative platform, but a massive and creative empire.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>What we need: we need your support and help in raising $2,500 to build the business, social, and creative sector of the business.</li>
<li>What you get: everyone who donates gets to receive an opportunity to be an official member of the company and the financial, social and personal benefits that comes with such. All that is required is once the campaign has reached the deadline, every contributor who donated sends an email with proof of donation to booksmartrecords@gmail.com and following that, instruction will be given on how to obtain legal membership of the business.</li>
<li>If by chance we don't reach the  entire goal at the end of the campaign, the funds raised  will go towards building  the company and expanding membership to supporters.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Below I will explain more about our campaign and let everyone  know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>This project is more than a fundraiser, it’s an experience that allows people to be a part of change , in music, business, entertainment, art, etc....</li>
<li>Imagine a social climate where it becomes intriguing to see young entrepreneurs receive the support they need to build and express their ideas while being able to share the benefits with the world.</li>
<li>This campaign will spark a pattern of positive innovation that will lead us into a better future.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While the campaign presents a load of optimistic properties, there are difficult obstacles that come along with a campaign of this nature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a financial goal of $2.5k isn't exactly something that can be done overnight and 2 months is quite a tight gap to allocate.</li>
<li>Although this won’t be the easiest task , collectively we will provide enough resources to assist each other in achieving the goal with success!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We realize that some  people may not be able to contribute, but that doesn't mean the opportunity to help is gone, there are still other ways to  help :</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to tell others to get the word out verbally and make some noise about the campaign.</li>
<li>Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools! That way the reach goes beyond just one platform.</li>

The Road To Glory campaign is about utilizing the support of the public to elevate a standard LLC to not only an innovative platform, but a massive and creative empire.


What We Need & What You Get

What we need: we need your support and help in raising $2,500 to build the business, social, and creative sector of the business.
What you get: everyone who donates gets to receive an opportunity to be an official member of the company and the financial, social and personal benefits that comes with such. All that is required is once the campaign has reached the deadline, every contributor who donated sends an email with proof of donation to booksmartrecords@gmail.com and following that, instruction will be given on how to obtain legal membership of the business.
If by chance we don't reach the  entire goal at the end of the campaign, the funds raised  will go towards building  the company and expanding membership to supporters.


The Impact
Below I will explain more about our campaign and let everyone  know the difference their contribution will make:

This project is more than a fundraiser, it’s an experience that allows people to be a part of change , in music, business, entertainment, art, etc....
Imagine a social climate where it becomes intriguing to see young entrepreneurs receive the support they need to build and express their ideas while being able to share the benefits with the world.
This campaign will spark a pattern of positive innovation that will lead us into a better future.


Risks & Challenges
While the campaign presents a load of optimistic properties, there are difficult obstacles that come along with a campaign of this nature:

Having a financial goal of $2.5k isn't exactly something that can be done overnight and 2 months is quite a tight gap to allocate.
Although this won’t be the easiest task , collectively we will provide enough resources to assist each other in achieving the goal with success!


Other Ways You Can Help
We realize that some  people may not be able to contribute, but that doesn't mean the opportunity to help is gone, there are still other ways to  help :

Be sure to tell others to get the word out verbally and make some noise about the campaign.
Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools! That way the reach goes beyond just one platform.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>First and Foremost this is a legitimate campaign!</h3>
<p><b>I Know it's super silly but I'm very serious about making these if the campaign is funded.</b></p>
<h3>Who's making these BabaDongs?</h3>
<p>Hey everyone! The name is Cig Neutron! I'm a special fx artist working in Los Angeles with over 10 years of experience. I've worked on major motion pictures, TV shows, and for many youtube companies such as Nerdist, Machinima, etc. I've shown in fine art galleries all across the states with many people owning my art around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Why the obviously fake name Billy Raygun?</strong> ***update*** well I'm Cig Neutron and being open about it. **** Chances are, you may know who I am. I've decided to remain anonymous (at least for now) because of the nature of the product. I've wanted to make sex toys for some time, but I don't think a decent portion of my fan base will appreciate them. This campaign is a way for me to have the freedom to make what I want, and help people in the process!</p>
<p>The idea for the BabaDong hit me recently (just in time for pride month!) and I thought it would be a great way to put out a fun product, and help a cause I'm passionate about at the same time. I am a huge supporter of LGBTQ rights. If this campaign takes off I will be donating 10% of the profits to The Lambert House.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign is for preorders to see if there is enough interest to pursue the BabaDong. Producing a product like this is very expensive. I have the completed sculpt, but I am waiting to see if the demand is high enough before I sink money into the materials necessary to mold, cast, and produce these. I will only go into production if we hit the minimum goal of $15,000. If the goal isn't met then no one will be charged. The BabaDong sculpture will just sit on my shelf collecting dust, and give me a little chuckle every time I glance at it. The reason for the minimum goal of $15,000 is to protect myself and backers. It's a ton of work to produce a product like this. I love this idea, but the last thing I want to do is make a bunch of dildos that no one wants....</p>
<p>If the goal is met, the BabaDong will go into production. I will be updating all backers on the production process, so you will all rest assured that your Babadongs are getting Babadone.</p>
<p>The standard BabaDong will come in Black. However if the campaign takes off I have a few color options in mind that backers can upgrade to if they so desire. Colors include bomb pop, and Rainbow....my personal favorite might be bomb pop. Complicated color schemes are more labor intensive so an additional cost would be added to upgrade</p>

<h3>The Charity</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>The Charity I've chosen to donate a portion of the proceeds to is The Lambert House. Growing up I've experienced firsthand the hate and intolerance that people are capable of. It's easy for a young mind to be convinced to hate themselves for who they are. I believe that no one should ever have to feel like that. The world is a beautiful place filled with amazing people who will love you for who you are. All you have to do is find them. Among many other things the Lambert house is there to help find those people.</p>
<p><strong>***Please note that this campaign is not in anyway endorsed by the Lambert house. Honestly, they probably don't even know about it.

We have worked on taking photos hiring models , building sets and props. Always looking to improve our images and make them better. We have looked at many formats and website networks to try and find the best way to deliver our images to artists. All were lacking in some way , they were just too clunking to use or not efficient in archiving and retrieving images. Many offered a host of options that just got in the way such as selling t-shirts and coffee mugs. We are doing one thing . Providing artists with high quality photographs to use in the creation of there own artwork. That is why we have decided to build the website to our specifications. Our reference will help you create new artwork that is new to the art scene. we also have an non exclusive commercial license that will enable you to market your creations with confidence. Once our site is live the cost will be about $50 for a half year and $80 for 1 year. We will only be offering 1/2 year and 1 year subscriptions. We want things to be simple and efficient. Also because our figure reference category contains nudity you must be 18 years of age or older to help fund this campaign.Why use our reference?</p>

<p>Hello!  I'm Tom Latourette, I'm a Children's Book author and co-founder of the BTB Foundation.  Last year, at the tender, young age of 53, I followed a life-long dream and saw my first Children's Book - ""I Had a Runny Nose"",published by Eckhartz Press.  The cool thing is that we were able to have 100% of the proceeds from that book go to support local families fighting cancer. </p>
<p>Now I'm asking for your help to up the ante and make an even bigger impact on families, especially kids!  I'd like to enlist you to powerfully launch my 2nd Children's book - ""I Had An Upset Stomach"" (you can see the trend) by getting it into the hands of children fighting cancer or the children whose parents or siblings are suffering.  I'm also hoping to give those families some relief by offering them a creative respite from their battle! </p>
<p>We've combined the power of 3 foundations I'm involved with and have created a cool and unique program.  We're hoping, with your help, that we can bring thousands of kids laughter, smiles and creativity while they're fighting this horrible disease.     </p>

<li>The art therapy of Sally's Studio</li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to get this program off the ground and get the best pricing for books and art boxes we're looking for some pre-order help and funding commitments from our supporters! </p>
<p>If you help us, we've created some cool ways for you to get in on the fun and giving!  </p>
<ul>
<li>Buy a book and give a book to kids fighting cancer! </li>
<li>We'll acknowledge your generosity inside each book! </li>
<li>Each book funded will also fund a daily art experience for a child or family member battling this disease!   </li>
<li>You'll also have a chance to get your hands on one of Ben's custom, limited edition lithographs! </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>The Impact You'll Make!  </h3>
<p>Your donation will bring smiles and laughter while igniting the passions and creativity of children battling cancer.  The benefits of art therapy are numerous and can make a HUGE difference in a kids' struggle.  Please help us get these tools in front of thousands of kids and Chicagoland families!  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Sam. I am a small-time disabled artist. I started the Mushroom and Cryptid campaign to begin creating stickers out of art that I've designed. People expressed an interest in having stickers of the designs and thus the campaign was born!

<p>A total of $500 is being asked for to start with. $500 will allow me to purchase diecut Mothman stickers, afford last minute shipping cost add-ons and packaging for each contributor,  afford a sample of the diecut Mothman stickers for testing (to see if a change of printing company is needed), afford fees and taxes, and to pay me for designing the sticker and for the time to package and ship everything. <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">If the goal is passed, it will enable me to purchase more sticker designs such as Loch Ness Monster and the Fresno Nightcrawler.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main challenge faced is not passing the monetary goal.

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute monetarily to the campaign, but still want to help, there are other ways! Feel free to share the campaign with others who like cryptids and stickers. Indiegogo has share tools specifically for this purpose! </p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello! My name is Sam. I am a small-time disabled artist. I started the Mushroom and Cryptid campaign to begin creating stickers out of art that I've designed. People expressed an interest in having stickers of the designs and thus the campaign was born! Without contributors, Mushroom and Cryptid designs probably wouldn't turn into a physical item (stickers) at all, due to me being disabled and unable to afford to print off stickers myself.

What We Need & What You Get

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:<br/> I'm Kelly Chao , been in the hospitality industry for long till Covid 19 came. During the lockdown i realized i've got talent and i decided to make use of the free time i have to better my talent. I've done several paint works which i sold out. I am planning to print and distribute an art book of my Quarantine Painting series. Each will be printed in color, with accompanying text explaining and discussing the intent of the piece. Scans are ready. Layout is in progress and i plan to order the book on the last day of this Campaign. It usually takes 6-10 weeks for printing, proofing and their shipping to me.</p>
<p>Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:<br/>I'll order a print run at full size of these paintings and another at a smaller size. They may not be available again later.(Depending on how well this goes!) Prints usually take only a week or two to be ready to ship out. The funds needed to order in, ship out and prints is the goal total. It leaves me with a slim margin of extra, so i can add more items if this does well.</p>

They should always connect with their true passion.Referring to famous speech in 1963 by  Martin Luther King Jr - ""I have a dream"".As an individual we all have dream's and we should rightly have dream to do something in life both professionally & personally.We should give our best to achieve those dreams,  ""Leave no stone unturned"".Ultimately, passion is the driving force behind success and happiness that allows all of us achieve those dreams. We would like to help every passionate individual's who dream, and who want to achieve their dream's and be a Star in their lives.FansnStars would love to be a part of your journey to success.Be a Star on FansnStars ! Who are we ?FansnStars is a unique form of business, which involves two main existing businesses Social networking &  e-Commerce. Problems we noticed  ?
As an upcoming artists it is very difficult to find the right, genuine fans who could not only appreciate the artist's talent but also support him/her to continue on their passion.
And as a genuine fan it is equally difficult to secure a genuine and signed autographs, memorabilia or to buy original painting's, designer apparels etc.
How are we solving the problem ?
FansnStars will have a ready to use platform for artists, they just need to signup and start selling directly to their fans worldwide.
Fans will be able to support their stars buy directly buying from their stores.
FansnStars would like to revolutionize the way memorabilia, autographs, artwork, designer apparel are bought and sold to fans around the world. An artists can be a upcoming or established star. Artists can be a small screen, theatre, sport stars or from any other fields such as writer’s, authors, musicians, painter’s, poet’s. All of them from any part of the world will be able to reach their genuine fans through FansnStars.​Currently the team size is 2 who have been working part-time on the platform and engaging with business and various artists. We would like to build a core team and at the same time we would like to take the platform to the market. Mission Statement: Our mission is to be the leading platform for an artist selling almost anything which fans will cherish to own.  Our Major Challenges Till date FansnStars is a self-funded and insufficient funds have impacted our growth and progress and we end up with all those common challenges which each startup’s usually face.Competition:  As a startup competition is a major challenge for us.

<h3>Humanity, the Exhibition</h3>
<p>Hello, we are Helen Needham, Nadine Anderson Cheng, Gilles Hurtaud, Allison Kotzig and Love Weber. 5 Artists who are advocates for a better, happier, and more environmentally conscious world.</p>
<p>Humanity, the Exhibition was created to fulfill the persistent call, to use the power of Art as a catalyst for social change. And we have been fortunate to be offered the opportunity to take this exhibition to 3 major cities.</p>
<p>With over 30 pieces of art, Humanity, promises to be visually and mentally stimulating, as each professional artist specializes in a variety of media, from oil painting to sculpture, photography to film. Inspired by current affairs, and by people like you. </p>
<p>Many of the artworks focus on the environment— being kinder to our homeland, Earth. Other works look at the growing integration of different cultures through migration, human rights, with the twists and turns of colonial history, family traditions, sedation through technology, and human interactions with the power of love to start a conversation of healing. The exhibition interactive elements, pull the viewer through the doors of self discovery, while its video installations listen to the many voices of the world speaking in unison with their views on today's humanity...you may be surprised at the universal consciousness on the rise. </p>
<p><strong>We believe</strong> that you and visitors to our exhibition will be positively impacted by this thought-provoking collective that reflect daily life—seeing us all as one people.</p>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>We hope</strong> you will get <i><strong>Plugged in</strong></i> with us as we embark on this exciting adventure to educate and enlighten, to successfully spread awareness with a message of love and the importance of community well-being! </span></font></p>

Hello, we are Helen Needham, Nadine Anderson Cheng, Gilles Hurtaud, Allison Kotzig and Love Weber. 5 Artists who are advocates for a better, happier, and more environmentally conscious world.
Humanity, the Exhibition was created to fulfill the persistent call, to use the power of Art as a catalyst for social change. And we have been fortunate to be offered the opportunity to take this exhibition to 3 major cities.
With over 30 pieces of art, Humanity, promises to be visually and mentally stimulating, as each professional artist specializes in a variety of media, from oil painting to sculpture, photography to film. Inspired by current affairs, and by people like you. 
Many of the artworks focus on the environment— being kinder to our homeland, Earth. Other works look at the growing integration of different cultures through migration, human rights, with the twists and turns of colonial history, family traditions, sedation through technology, and human interactions with the power of love to start a conversation of healing. The exhibition interactive elements, pull the viewer through the doors of self discovery, while its video installations listen to the many voices of the world speaking in unison with their views on today's humanity...you may be surprised at the universal consciousness on the rise. 
We believe that you and visitors to our exhibition will be positively impacted by this thought-provoking collective that reflect daily life—seeing us all as one people.
We hope you will get Plugged in with us as we embark on this exciting adventure to educate and enlighten, to successfully spread awareness with a message of love and the importance of community well-being! 
We know that with your generous contributions, this tour to Köln, Basel and London between May and July, 2019, will come to fruition.

<p>This Idea for Table-Art was created when I was at my daughter's apartment in NYC, she was living in a very small apartment she had no space for a coffee table or for a dining or desk table. So I came up with the idea of Wall Hanging Art that turns into a coffee table and also a desk or dinning table. </p>
<p>Table-Art a great new patented idea In decor designed and invented by Mark Watts 24”X 36” beautiful anodized aluminum framed wall art that transforms into  an art faced coffee table and extends into a desk table. Hanging picture frame size is 24"" X 36"", 2"" thick / Coffee table height 17"" high / Desk table height 28"". The art is changeable and ships with 4 great changeable prints one is a Transformer print of Mark Watts Art. You can hang horizontal or vertical with 2 holes on Horizontal side and 2 on Vertical side. Also hangs well with 3M 17 Lb Velcro. Unit Weight is 14Lb. </p>
<p>Transformer Artist Mark Watts is the Original G1 Transformer Artist from 1981 and beyond he Illustrated 45 + boxes for the Transformer kids toys.</p>
<p>Also the Inventor of this Transforming Table-Art.  </p>
<p>Own some of his Transformer Art and other Art to help fund this great project.   </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We created a prototype that worked well, although it needed some refinements. I thought what a useful great space saving concept so I researched the idea to see if a patent existed, to my surprise no one had a patent on this concept and no product like this existed in the market place. I already had my drawings and a working prototype so I applied for a patent and received a full patent in about 18 months. After about 10 prototypes we refined the product Table-Art to a streamlined very well constructed useful product. The 14 Lb weight is sturdy enough to be a table yet not to heavy to lift and hang on a wall. Made out of quality materials, anodized aluminum and stainless steel screws so the product will never rust. It is constructed so the art is fully interchangeable and ships with 4 pieces of art included.</p>
<p>We really need your help funding this great useful space saving product. In order to make this affordable we need to produce a large enough volume to keep price down. We need to make tooling, molds, dyes and parts for a large production. So please help us fund this space saving and useful product Table-Art. If you are one of the first to help us you can receive your own Table-Art at a great savings of the retail price and also receive 4 great Mark Watts prints,  Transformer print, Tropical Car print, Wine print and  Tropical Sail Boat print shown. </p>
<p>I have a full Patent No: 9,295,323, B2 </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This product is a great for space-saving areas like apartments small homes or just to have an extra when table when needed. </p>
<p>Features:</p>
<p>- Framed Wall Art that transformers into a coffee table and desk table.</p>
<p>- Has changeable art use any art or photo you like 24” X 36”.</p>
<p>- Ships with 4 great changeable pieces of art.</p>
<p>- Quality constriction materials anodized aluminum, stainless steel rust proof.</p>
<p>- Stable weight of 14Lb for coffee table, desk table and easy weight to hang. </p>
<p>- Hangs horizontal or vertical with hanging holes in unit, also can be hung with 3M 17Lb  Velcro. </p>
<p>Make It your own / Add any family photo, photo, art or Transformer Art you like 22"" X 34"".  Any Prints can be used in Table-Art, holds up to 4 prints. Unit ships with 4 Mark Watts prints. Add new prints any time you like.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenge is producing this new product Table-Art, a well made functional product with high standards. We were on top of this by producing a series of prototypes over 15, Then when the prototype was perfected we went on to produce a small number of hand done prototypes. We had people use them and see how they held up in everyday use. These were expensive because all hand done. We needed to work out potential problems in functionally and quality. Now that we have a good understanding of the product we need to produce plastic ejection molds for all connectors for aluminum as well as extruding aluminum molds. All materials on this product are non rusting and durable materials. With a high quality anodized aluminum frame. The delays could be in ejection molding and extruding tooling for aluminum but we don't think this will be a problem because we are working on this early in the production of the project. This product is made up of a number of parts in that we needed to produce punch dies for ect. We are only working on this project Table-Art so it has our full attention, this will be a cool, great space saving quality product with nothing like it in the market place. The only other challenge we see is if this product Table-Art does very well, is keeping up with a large production run. Please help us fund this great new useful space saving product, Thank You!</p>

<p><strong>Kamptastic</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone my name is Catherine “Kampie” Manno. I am 38 years old and I absolutely love anything having to do with art and music. I suffer from many chronic issues that I am not letting defeat me. I have found the love of my life Callie and desire to make the most of lives from starting my own business. </p>
<p>My campaign is rather simple. I would love to have a business producing journals and planners for those with chronic illness, lack of motivation, and to get healthy. I would love to have a brick and mortar at some point which I hope to live above or beside. This money would be a start up to getting things to sell to save up for the big picture. Also, to create more items to run bigger and better campaigns.</p>
<p>I want to create something that brings positive light to the wired world out there. There needs to be time to unplug and give yourself a moment to make sure you are on track for the life you want, need, and deserve. Your donation will help that, also you can receive some really neat stuff. The world needs more understanding of people and by letting out our feelings we can figure out what is really going on when life travels down that stray path here and there.</p>
<p><strong>The Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>Right now I am striving for a donation of $2500. I know it seems a lot for some coloring books, and you are right. However you are not just funding my coloring book, but helping me start a business!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What your money will be used for other than living expenses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Producing the perks. (Of course!)</li>
<li>Creating prototypes so I can test and see what works</li>
<li>Paying friends for their services like driving and testing products as well as doing anything I can’t do because of my chronic issues.</li>
<li>I would love to have an actual desk in my home, the TV tray doesn’t always cut it.</li>
<li>Keeping a roof over me and my business is $360 at the moment hopefully I can get into a lower income apartment. I currently live in a strip club basement. It is not glamorous as one might think.</li>
<li>Advertising on Facebook. Once I get this campaign going there will be a page for the business. I feel advertising correctly could help get the brand noticed.</li>
<li>Getting my business going for more fun motivational products.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Perks</strong></p>
<p>The unique perks are going to be pretty exciting if you are a fan of adult coloring! It’s great for children as well!</p>
<p>The main book will be beautiful designs with geometric and floral shapes along with positive quotes. This is the starting idea. Donations will go to producing the perks first. You deserve something for being so generous to help me. I am hoping that through the funding I can add more pages to the book as time goes on. Will also be adding pages for previews of my journals and planners. </p>
<p>I plan on having some key chains, book marks, coloring pages, habit trackers, coloring habit trackers, as hands on previews of other items in the Kamptastic brand. These will be included in some of the perk bundles</p>
<p>I assure you your donation will go to great use on my part and yours. Also you will be added to the Kamptastic Fan Club, StarShines,which will offer you discounts and first look at new items.</p>
<p>Now if I do not reach my entire goal some perks may suffer, and I would really not like to let anyone down. Make sure to support to get the best out of your donation by sharing it with your friends.</p>
<p><strong>This is Very Important to Me</strong></p>
<p>This is my passion project. I want to make the world a better place and I know it is not something I can do on my own. I hope that starting Kamptastic will allow me to help others in their goals even if the world seems to be against them. Offering tools to help others is a great start. The journals I have created for myself have helped me out a lot in trying to get my issues under control.</p>
<p>I do have a great passion for this project and I hope to succeed in it. Any questions, comments and concerns can be asked for answering in an update, which will be as often as I can.</p>
<p><strong>What Could Go Wrong?</strong></p>
<p>Lots… but I am superior with damage control.</p>
<p>I am not a well person. I struggle like most humans. I have a few health issues piled on as well. Some days I am fatigued, engulfed in a brain fog, and unreliable to even my close friends. I do worry about not meeting deadlines I set for myself.</p>
<p>I will indeed overcome these issues. I have an excellent support system of loving friends who check in on me daily to make sure I am getting things done. This will happen, I am passionate and have a fire burning, I am trying to get better and healthier. I want others to know that achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Not the Right Campaign for You</strong></p>
<p>Number one thing I hear is, “I have no money…” Don’t worry I do not expect anyone to support anything that they don’t want to. If it’s not your thing that is fine, please do not feel you have to explain. Maybe you could share using some of the great tools that Indiegogo offers? I know one share could go a long way</p>

<h3>What you get &amp; what we need</h3>
<p>I had the idea of creating this <strong>calendar for the year 2020</strong>. It is a beautiful artistic calendar, illustrated with old photographs by Wilhelm von Gloende, a great German photographer (1856-1931), who developed his career primarily in Taormina, Italy. He is famous for his photographic studies of young Sicilians, who generally appear with very careful poses, in spaces with classic references.</p>

I always found the content in the training just didn't align with my personal interests.  Robots and cars don't pique my interest. I'm a surfer and surfing piques my interest. It's time to bring 3D Surf Art and Animations to the world. I've developed some unique wave materials (shaders) for surf art, and learned the various techniques to make 3d surf art and animations. But, I'm not hoarding my knowledge on this. Instead, I'm giving it away quite cheap. By providing you with complete scenes as well as video training, I'm certain you will be able to create your own great surf art and learn 3D technology in the process. The software used is Blender - version 2.82 and migrating to version 2.83 once it is ready. This will work even with relatively low end machines (I'll show you the tricks to make that happen), but a better machine with a better graphics card will always perform better. As long as your computer is less than 5 years old, you should be good because we're going to use techniques to heavily optimize efficiency in the 3d meshes. I'm going to develop on a relatively new machine with a mid-scale graphics card, but I'm going to also test everything on a 2011 Mac Mini to ensure it works well with low end machines.</p></div>","I've been learning 3D technology over the last few years.

Participants will be provided with a canvas and drawing materials, and a heap of nude models to draw to their hearts desire. A soundscape of enhanced sound effects will provide a source of inspiration for the artists. Contrary to most figure drawing classes, there will be an absence of a teacher, meaning the artists will be free to cultivate their own styles and drawing methods. On top of creative expression, artists will be provided with the perfect networking sphere of likeminded individuals.</p><p align=""center""><strong>Introduction &amp; Background</strong></p><p>Founded in 2017, under the name ‘Jagazeen Life’, <i>Dalí’s Daughters</i> began as a life drawing event catering for stag and hen parties. However, after pursuing this market for some time it appeared quite difficult to locate the target market without a strong web presence and a large marketing budget. This, alongside the ethical position of the company, provoked the shift from the stag party market, to the general public.</p><p>Sitting in on a lecture at the <i>Universitat Bellas Artes</i>, the colourful history of Salvador Dalí was unveiled, and inspired the shift from ‘Jagazeen Life’ to <i>Dalí’s Daughters</i>. This change in name provided a sturdy theme for the events, and also captured an already existing segment of Dalí fans. This opened the doors to many opportunities and it was not long before a dedicated following of <i>Dalí’s Daughters </i>was formed.</p><p>Based upon the absurd character of Dalí, famous for his paintings and sculptures, but less well known for his bizarre fly eating habits, and colourful orgies held with his wife as the protagonist. <i>Dalí’s Daughters</i> has become a unique project of surrealist life drawing, designed to attract those who believe in a sustainable view of art and the human body. In this fragile era of technology and political unrest, Art can be a vital and volatile distraction from the pressures of society to succeed, in a time when the recipe to success is still being written. This project is designed to strip the supposed ‘reality’ from its haunches, and reveal what is really real. In the end, we are consciousness disguised within human bodies, disguised beneath fashion and money.</p><p>The founder of <i>Dalí’s Daughters</i> has extensive experience in the life drawing sector, and it has become apparent that many organizations appropriate the human body, handing out certificates (‘I love to draw big tits’), and treating models with casual disregard. This has stemmed from a culture of online pornography and appropriation of bodies as something to abuse and manipulate. For this reason, a platform of respectful, cultural artistry seemed well overdue. <i>Dalí’s Daughters</i> provides this platform, taking the ‘pornography’ from nudity, and promoting free expression and entertainment.</p><p align=""center"" style=""margin-left:18.0pt;""><strong>Business model</strong></p><p>The core business model of <i>Dalí’s Daughters</i> can be segmented into 5 parts:</p><ol>
<li>
<strong>Purpose:</strong> Art for Art’s sake: <i>Dalí’s Daughters</i> has been created with the intent to promote freedom of expression and a healthy attitude toward the human body. The act of drawing is also proven to be highly meditative and relaxing, and excellent exercise for the brain. In addition, the classes exist as a private sphere, wherein people are able to discuss the political upheaval in the surrounding world, and escape the prevalent moral panics that are overtaking the media. There is no alternate motive behind the project, merely to get back to the roots of humanism and reveal the colourful history of art in times of political upheaval. The project is aimed not just at artists, but also toward compete novices, as a free space to try their hand at creativity.</li>
<li value=""2"">
<strong>Business Process:</strong> The business process follows a linear line of action. The marketing of the brand and the events is consistent, whereas all other business processes are acted out in a ‘Just in Time’ structure. This is accounted for in the infrastructure of the company too, wherein all models and space are hired solely for the duration of the class. There is no permanent office space, nor permanent employees. This reduces the need for high fixed costs, and adds a flexibility to the business model.</li>
<li value=""3"">
<strong>Target Customers:</strong> Using Meet Up as the primary source of advertising, the target market has automatically revolved toward the tourist segment. Many visitors look at events on Meet Up in order to make friends and experience a little of what Barcelona has to offer. As the platform is segmented into categories, ‘Art’, ‘Hiking’ etc. it is easy for customers to locate the project. Art university residents are also one of the primary target segments. The business model caters well for students as classes count toward research and classwork for schools, and are held in the evening when most people are free from school or work.</li>
<li value=""4"">
<strong>Culture: </strong>The nature of <i>Dalí’s Daughters</i> as a nude figure drawing clan means that the culture surrounding the brand is tangible. Each model and participant brings a unique perspective to the events, and discussions continue on online platforms well after the classes take place. The aforementioned ‘cult-like’ following is a major part of the company culture. Each participant is dedicated to the brand, and tries to enhance the effectivity of the events by bringing props, sound bites and costume to add to the flavor of the events. For this reason, <i>Dalí’s Daughters</i> has grown into a collaborative business model, wherein the market sews into the tapestry of the business, a postmodern bricolage of a business.</li>
<li value=""5"">
<strong>Inspiration:</strong> Born and raised in Figueres, Dalí is famous for pushing the surrealist movement in Spain. His character was considered largely eccentric, and for this he was penalized by wider society, however his work continues to be cherished globally. This is the ethos that runs in the undercurrent of <i>Dalí’s Daughters</i>. Whilst much of the public may perceive the ethics behind the organization as offensive, due to the nudity, the work is respected for its uniqueness, and a large following is cultivated.</li>
</ol><p align=""center""><strong>Unique Selling Propositions</strong></p><p>The USP of <i>Dalí’s Daughters </i>lies within the uniqueness of the project. Where there are many life drawing events held, none are as specific and daring as <i>Dalí’s Daughters. </i></p><ol><li><strong>A multitude of models, of all genders and ages. </strong></li></ol><p>Each event employs 3 models, generally two females, and one male. This allows drawers to pick and choose their subject, and allows them to view the concrete difference between the gender forms. Generally, figure drawing provides a single model, and this model is the focal point, leaving little room for creativity. In <i>Dalí’s Daughters, </i>participants can experiment with which style suits the individual body, and actively observe the notion that ‘all bodies are different’. After all, many people have never had the opportunity to observe a singular nude form, let alone multiple, it is a truly enlightening experience.</p><ol><li value=""2""><strong>Mise-En-Scene</strong></li></ol><p>Most competitors favor the ‘white room, bright light’ approach in figure drawing, believing that the best practice comes from an obvious, central subject. At <i>Dalí’s Daughters </i>we negate this belief. The room is strewn with props and the models are adorned with costumes. Often, artists will be found drawing the papier mache rabbits, or the glowing moon orb, instead of the models themselves. This pinpoints to the artist a distinct contrast between the drawing still life, and real life, as well as injecting a little kookiness to the finished work.</p><ol><li value=""3""><strong>Moving Models</strong></li></ol><p>It is a well-known fact that life models must be well versed in the art of staying still. In <i>Dalí’s Daughters </i>this is not a requirement. Whilst the models are encouraged to hold a pose for as long as possible, they have the freedom to switch positions whenever they feel. This normally occurs in time with the soundtrack. Whilst this can be tiresome for the artist, the message is clear ‘life drawing’, is life, and life is full of movement. The resulting sketches are full of movement and life as a result of this. This is also an attractive USP for the models, who enjoy being treated as living people rather than statues.</p><ol><li value=""4""><strong>Sound and Light</strong></li></ol><p>We are living in an era of augmented and virtual reality, wherein cinemas are pumping smells into the audience to provoke sensory stimulation. <i>Dalí’s Daughters</i> excites the senses by layering a hand crafted soundtrack over the class. The artwork produced tends to follow the vein of the soundtrack at any given time, in a way that is reminiscent of synesthesia. Each sound draws the focus point to a different curve of the body, or a different method of brush stroke. Feedback largely revolved around the use of soundscapes throughout the session.</p><ol><li value=""5""><strong>Nude Staff</strong></li></ol><p>An unplanned element to the evening has been the addition of nude staff. More of a gimmick than a USP, this helps the models to relax and ‘normalizes’ nudity. Participants enjoy trying to draw the mobile staff members. This also gives the opportunity to show the human body in action, how the muscles move, and how actions are normally hidden beneath a layer of fabric.</p><p style=""margin-left:36.0pt;""><strong>Future Plans:</strong></p><p><i>Dalí’s Daughters </i>will run on a weekly basis, using a rotation of models and customers. Future events will be held in a house, or in the Bellas Artes school. A partnership with Bellas Artes will be set up to ensure the future of the business, but as of yet there are no plans to register the business as a company until proper profits come rolling in. Global expansion is being discussed, with volunteers willing to hold events in New Zealand, Mexico and Brighton, under the name <i>Dalí’s Daughters. </i>Future sessions will include full house figure drawing, wherein artists will move around the room, drawing figures placed on beds and sofas and toilets.

Now you don't need to re-plant, you can just change the color of your flowers! This petunia has creamy white blossoms, but when you water it with our special solution flowers turn from white to vibrant red in 24 hours - and then stays red for the life of the flower.  To return to white, just water with regular H20. All of the new flowers will be white. 
Color changing flowers are just the first step in personalized plants. We hope you'll join us in planting a whole new garden. 

Why do you need a color changing flower? 


You love plants!  Your garden is full of rare and unique plants and you're looking for a beautiful addition no one else will have. 


You are an educator! and you want a cool, hands on way to share science with your students.   

You are an artist! You love the intersection between science and art, and this flower represents the challenges and opportunities there. 

You think biotechnology is the coolest thing out there! You want to share that with your friends & family with a piece of beautiful biotech everyone can enjoy. 


Why color changing flowers? 


They're pretty darn cool!
Everyone loves petunias - we buy about 11 million of them in the US every year
There are decades of incredible research behind our flowers & we're working with experts to develop these flowers. 
They're the beginning of a whole new way of thinking about biology. We can work with it, not against it, to build a beautiful sustainable future.




Making flowers change color was artificial, slow, and out of your control. 


For cut flowers, you needed dyes or chemicals, neither of which color the flower fully and completely.  Florists sometimes remedy this with spray paint to get the brilliant hues you see in your average daisy bouquet.   Who wants to smell spray paint? 


The color changing flowers you grow in your garden, hydrangeas for example, change color slowly, and according to a complex network of environmental cues that you might not be able to control. We've taken the guessing out of it with the color-changing petunia - just share a beer with the plant and watch it change color in hours! 





How does it work?

<p><i>“... if there is something in the world you are dreaming of doing, just have a look at those who are already doing that. When you see that they are just ordinary people, you’ll realize you may do that thing too and succeed.</i>” - <strong><i>Federico Fellini</i></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Who are we?</strong></h2>
<p>Welcome, dear friends! You have paid attention to our project and it is already a success for us! However, the information below will also be of great interest to you, and you may also be feeling anxious about the implementation of this project, just the way I am.</p>
<p>Life is an art. Creating your own life, enjoying it and giving joy to other people is the way of a real human being.</p>
<p>No matter what form the art may take, its ultimate goal has always been the same - the development of the spiritual sphere of mankind through emotional content, the satisfaction of its desire for beauty.</p>
<p>But has anyone ever thought of how many obstacles there are between an author and humanity? How hard is it for a person who is really talented to show their works? Sometimes, it takes an artist longer than a lifetime to do that...</p>
<p>Did you know that Vincent Van Gogh died in 1890 and he had sold during his life only one painting for $109 (converted to the current purchasing power of the dollar)? He became popular only in 1920, i.e. 20 years after his death...</p>
<p>Paul Gauguin, Amedeo Modigliani, Franz Kafka, Emily Dickinson... This list can be continued. I think that the people who were deprived of the possibility to be represented timely and were recognized by society too late have slowed down the development of mankind.</p>
<p>It should have be written here that we are a small group of enthusiasts who admire art and would like to promote it. However, when I started working on this project, the people participating in it refused to do so, fearing the impossibility to compete with the existing portals. Nevertheless, I know for sure that competition has never harmed anyone, and therefore I am willing to see it through to the end and I am confident that with your help, this goal will be achieved.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481720305/pkkrmiozcx1wvshjztbu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I became interested in the arts about three years ago, when I tried my own hand at painting. To be honest, I failed completely, but I felt a great desire to help those people who are really good at art. Moreover, when I found out how many obstacles a young artist has in their way to recognition, this desire to help only grew stronger and stronger every day.</p>
<p>My major occupation is finance and law. I have worked for over 9 years in the field of business auditing, and therefore the control over business processes is something I have considerable experience in. At the moment, I am voluntarily assisted by my friends who I also consider to be professionals in their fields: managers, linguists, graphic designers and other people who would like to make this world a better place.</p>
<p>We believe that the popularization of art will be the driving force for this world.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What is Leox.red?</strong></h2>
<p>Have you ever created anything by yourself? And if so, what brought you joy: the fact of creating something new or the happiness of realizing that your work would be estimated at its true worth by others? I think the answer is: both.</p>
<p>And have you ever bought a really unique thing? What did you feel when you realized it was one of a kind? It is a great feeling and you know it.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create the largest trading platform in the world for the sale of hand-made art. This is what Leox is about.</p>
<p>We are not talking about famous artists only, who are already known and honored in their own countries and worldwide, but rather all the people involved in arts. Furthermore, we are talking about beginning artists, sculptors and craftsmen. We are sure that any work of art created with feeling will find its owner, even if there are thousands of kilometers between them.</p>
<p>And it does not matter what it is - an oil painting or a bracelet made of stones from the island coast where you dream to travel to.</p>
<p>Leox.red is a business run in compliance with the existing models which have been substantially transformed in order to achieve better results taking into account the demands and desires of the new open-minded generation in which we belong.</p>
<p>It may seem that globalization has affected all the spheres of our life, but if you look closer, you will see that it has had absolutely no effect on craft in general and works of art in particular. You can buy any factory-made (mass produced) thing in any corner of the world any time, and, at the same time, it is extremely difficult to do so with respect to unique products.</p>
<p>Leox.red is intended to change this situation and give the world this opportunity.</p>
<p><i>The concept of the portal</i></p>
<p>Leox.red is a trading platform where, in order to post their lot, an artist should pay either a fixed fee or a certain percentage of each sale (i.e. a flexible pricing policy for users). By lot we mean one item from an artist which may have a few photos. An artist is unlimited in the number of items posted, but the number of photos uploaded to the items is limited.</p>
<p>Having analyzed the market of similar trading platforms, having studied in detail the strengths and weaknesses of each player and having justly estimated what new and better Leox.red can give to each of the parties interested in the process of trading works of art, we can say with certainty that we do have something to offer to creative people to realize their fullest potential!</p>
<p>Please read more details below.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><i>Do people really need this?</i></strong></h2>
<p><i>“By three methods we may learn wisdom: first, by reflection, which is noblest; second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest</i>.” <i><strong>- Confucius</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In today’s world, we will have to use all the three methods, and the first one is reflection.</p>
<p>The major players existing in the world today in this sector are <strong>etsy.com,</strong>  <strong>artmajeur.com</strong>, <strong>saatchiart.com</strong>, <strong>artenet.es</strong> and <strong>milanuncios.com</strong>. They cover mainly English-speaking and Spanish-speaking users, and have some drawbacks, which we will discuss in the section “Global Market” below.</p>
<p>Such specialized websites <strong>do not exist in the Ukrainian and Russian segments of the Internet</strong> (there are over 240 million users in these segments in total). The main players in this location are trading platforms specializing in the sale of the most demanded categories of goods, i.e. typical bulletin boards.</p>
<p>In fact, Leox.red just alters dramatically (in comparison with other portals in this location) the so-called <i>“forming the product range”</i> to occupy its niche in the category <i>“selling specialized products”</i>. Therefore, while starting to develop our business, we accepted the hypothesis of the need for such a business as confirmed, but still, in order to reveal consumers and verify them further, we have conducted a comprehensive research of the market and its depth.</p>
<p>We have carried out a statistical monitoring of the potential sellers of goods in the social networks VK.com and FB (they were selected for the research, first of all, because of the large scale, and secondly, because the users are required to specify their hobby for the development of communication links), as well as analyzing the existing shopping portals.</p>
<p>For instance, on VK.com (<i>as of 15 July 2016, its average daily audience is 64,525,950 visitors</i>), the largest number of the people who specified “arts and crafts” as their hobby were in the categories: “Hand Embroidery” and “Hand Bead Embroidery” - the coverage of the <strong>top five</strong> such hobby groups was 980,705 people or 1.52% of the total audience. In the category “Hand-Painted Pictures”, the same selection indicator for the top five groups showed 316,488 people.</p>
<p>Since one person (no matter if he/she is an artist or just a person interested in art) is usually a member of about three of such groups simultaneously (but not more than four), the average number of the people interested in this topic was 393,088. This figure includes the people who like creating pictures (of all types) and the buyers of such pictures (who purchase certain finished paintings or order an artist to paint a particular picture), as well as potential buyers who have never made any deals before.</p>
<p>Every ninth person of the above number considers him-/herself to be an artist. Thus, the total number of artists in the top five such groups is 43,676 people. The majority of them are geographically located in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.</p>
<p><strong><i>Important note.</i></strong> <i>The average age of the users of this social network is 26 years. The users aged 35+ and 40+ are the minority in this network. However, they represent a huge amount of people interested in selling works of art.</i></p>
<p>As for Facebook, 1900 people from Ukraine have joined the active groups related to selling goods in the category “Oil Paintings” (7 largest groups), while in the categories “Hand Embroidery” and “Hand Bead Embroidery” - 5,385 people.</p>
<p>On the whole, in Ukraine alone, there are 5,864 people aged 19-26 years who create paintings at a level sufficient for selling.</p>
<p>These figures are also confirmed by the largest trading platforms in Ukraine - olx.ua and bigl.ua. For example, as of 21.11.2016, 38,220 ads were posted in the category “Paintings”, where one ad is one lot, i.e. one painting. Taking into account that, according to the above statistical surveys, one active artist always has more than 7 finished pictures and he/she posts on average 4 of them only, we can see that the total number of the artists who are actively selling their works in Ukraine are approximately 9,555 (4,170 of them are the people who are out of the age group of 19-26 years).</p>
<p>In Russia and Belarus, these figures were 28,394 and 2,714 people respectively. Another 3,013 people who have the potential to sell existing paintings are those who speak Russian but do not reside in the territory of these three countries.</p>
<p>As we see, Leox.red is in demand among young people, students and those who graduated from a high school no later than 5 years ago. It is the most active segment of the population in any country, the people who are looking for their place in this world and have something to offer to it. In order to make their dream come true, they have to show their works to as many potential buyers as possible, and opening a specialized portal for them would be akin to a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>The second category of people who will be interested in Leox.red (they are fewer than the above) are older people who are already fulfilled, have sufficient experience and, most likely, well-established social connections to promote their works.</p>
<p><i>Economic indicators</i></p>
<p>We have set the break-even point for the project. It is the least real achievable goal under the worst conditions of attracting active artists. It will be 5 months after the launch date of the portal. It is the deadline that we must make as short as possible, and all our calculations are based on the worst market conditions. The pricing tactics for the rent of lots was calculated in detail and takes into account the psychological features of the selected category of customers, as well as the real quality of life in the countries where Leox.red will start operating.</p>
<p>Thus, in order to achieve the break-even point within the first 5 months since the portal launch, Leox.red is to encourage people to post 8,200 items per month (hereinafter referred to as “lpm”), i.e. to have approximately 2,050 registered artists with an average placement rate of over 4 lpm.</p>
<p>Actually, it means that at the first stage, we have to attract at least <strong>4.7%</strong> of the local artists who are now posting their lots on other trading portals.</p>
<p>Therefore, any actions resulting in the exceed of 8,200 lpm will draw nearer the break-even point, while a smaller number of items posted will be extending the 5-month term.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is important to remember that up to this point we have been talking about the works of art in the category “Paintings” only. We have absolutely not considered the categories “Jewelry” and “Accessories”, which already have about 9,000 lots on the above trading platforms, as well as other categories, which do not exceed 5% in total of the category “Paintings” (i.e. approx. 1900 items).</p>
<p>To sum up, taking into consideration the information set forth above, we estimate the today’s width of the market of craft products in Ukraine alone as 49,120 lpm, in Russia - 141,970 lpm and in Belarus - 13,570 lpm.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the marketing campaign at the first stage will be focused simultaneously on the active artists of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.</p>
<p>At the same time, the goal of the campaign for Term 1 is to attract 17% of the users of other trading platforms in the category “Works of Art” in the three countries covered by Leox.red or numerically - 34,793 lpm.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481720428/zgj2kqnmv6b9jk0ngudv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why is Leox.red better than others?</strong></h2>
<p>In the current situation, when there are players in the market who enable users to post ads for sale, it seems it is pointless to get engaged in this struggle. This is what I heard from my former colleagues over and over again. But that is not really true. I would like to assure you of our competitiveness.</p>
<h3>I. Local market. What do the leading trading platforms offer in the countries where Leox.red will be presented during the first period?</h3>
<p>All the trading platforms in the starting location can be subdivided for our purpose into the following two categories:</p>
<p>1. Those that offer to post items for free (free ads), such as: <strong>olx.ua, aviso.ua, avito.ru, objavlenij.net, rusale.net, irr.ru</strong></p>
<p>2. Those that charge for posting items (ads with price formula), such as: <strong>bigl.ua, haubau.com.ua, meshok.net, megalot.com</strong></p>
<p>First of all, it should be noted that the above platforms <strong>do not have “Art” as a separate category on their landing page, </strong>which complicates greatly the search for the items you need.</p>
<p>For instance, on <strong>OLX</strong>, the most popular trading platform for free ads in the domain<strong> .ua</strong>, (it is also one of the most popular trading platforms in the world, since it has portals in many countries, e.g. the US, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, China), the sale of works of art are hidden in the category “Antiques/Collections”, which is accessed through the section “Hobby, Recreation and Sports”.</p>
<p>Similarly, on <strong>bigl.ua</strong>, the most popular platform for “ads with price formula”, the sale of paintings can be found at the address: “Home and Garden” ® “Décor” ® “Paintings”.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>the above websites do not provide a more detailed categorization of art depending on the style in which they are created</strong>. This is logical, since you have already had to click four links in order to just find a list of paintings.</p>
<p>Third, the platforms for free ads rely on the number of visits to their page, which is why the main target audience of such websites is the buyers and sellers of cars, household appliances and computer equipment. The marketing strategy of these platforms is also based on the principle of not focusing on a specific target group. <strong>“Everything for everyone” is the basic principle of such websites.</strong> They get monetized by advertising, which often turns their pages into heaps of pop-ups and intrusive banners.</p>
<p>Fourth, even though the platforms for “ads with price formula” provide less advertising, they also focus on massive participation and, <strong>in addition to the fee for posting an item, they often</strong> <strong>charge a fixed percentage of the value of a posted item after its sale</strong> (hence the name of the type of such platforms, because this percentage paid by the seller to the trading platform is calculated by a specific formula for each category of goods). This approach is often not beneficial for the sellers of works of art compared to the sellers of factory-made products, who sell goods in large quantities. Leox.red is not going to charge the percentage of a deal.</p>
<p>Fifth and most important, <strong>the strategic goal of all the above websites is to cover as many users as possible within one country</strong>. They achieve this goal by increasing the number of the categories of goods sold and by attracting new users. The drawback of such a wide coverage is that the link “buyer-seller” does not work outside the country where the portal is registered due to the complexity of communication between the users, as well as due to the difference of customs procedures for different types of goods in different countries. In order to enter new markets, such companies have to register new entities in other countries, to recruit staff and do all the same thing - get deeper into the local market by attracting as many users as possible. Naturally, such actions result in the increase of the operating costs.</p>
<p>In contrast, we may define the position of Leox.red as <strong>“Unique for All” </strong>and plan to increase the number of users by a wider geographical coverage, rather than by a deep localization. The fee paid by the users to the portal will provide them with support and marketing services, as well as with the capability of selecting the amount of advertising on their pages. These services will be unavailable if the fee is not paid.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>II. Global Market</strong></h3>
<p>The trading platform Leox.red will be designed in such a way that any information about an item entered will be automatically displayed to the users in the language they selected as the main one when entering the portal.</p>
<p>At the first stage, the platform will be offering its users to select one of the four languages available: Ukrainian, Russian, English and Spanish.</p>
<p>The major competitors are as follows:</p>
<p>- <strong>etsy.com</strong><strong> – </strong>40 000 000 lots and 104,509 artists 1.7M active sellers</p>
<p>- <strong>artmajeur.com</strong> - 1,820,182 lots and 104,509 artists</p>
<p>- <strong>saatchiart.com</strong> - 166,631 lots and 50,000 artists</p>
<p>- <strong>milanuncios.com</strong> - 50,617 lots and 15,338 artists</p>
<p>- <strong>artenet.es</strong> - 14,056 lots and 4,685 artists</p>
<p>The above platforms have some disadvantages. Leox.red plans to occupy a niche in this market by eliminating these disadvantages.</p>
<p>One of these drawbacks is charging an artist a percentage of the cost of their item sold (it should also be not less than a certain fixed amount), which is not profitable when selling low-cost paintings (cheaper than $200) (no flexible pricing policy).</p>
<p>Second. There is no sufficient marketing support of such portals in Russian speaking countries. The main buyers of paintings here are the collectors who found out about these websites through internal channels. The chain of selling paintings to design studios and directly to entities is extremely inefficient. It is impossible to single out some young artist here out of their total number.</p>
<p>Third. Only one of these websites (<strong>saatchiart.com</strong>) generates its own social life (exhibitions, meetings with authors, etc.), yet in English-speaking countries only. Leox.red is going to increase the coverage of such events.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Project implementation timing:</strong></h3>
<p>• Raising funds and (in case it is successful due to your help) transferring them to the project team - by 21 January 2017</p>
<p>• Incorporation of the company: 23 January to 31 January 2017</p>
<p>• All stages of creating the portal: 31 January to 28 April 2017</p>
<p>• Launching the portal: from 1 May 2017</p>
<p>• Reaching the break-even point: by 2 October 2017</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What we need?</strong></h2>
<p>The most important thing in this category is to realize that Leox.red will be implementing finished business solutions, and accordingly, the cycles and stages of its formation will differ from the typical cycles of start-ups. Therefore, the costs will include the value of the product creation, expenses on setting up the company and the first marketing steps to enter the market.</p>
<p>Besides, of course, an operating enterprise needs the following monthly expenses (they are now planned in the cost of the project and will last until the break-even point of the enterprise): salary of the employees to be hired, costs associated with the maintenance of the portal and company for 7 months.</p>
<p>An important part of the costs will be the compulsory payments made to the platform Indiegogo.com and payment processor fees. According to the terms and conditions of the crowdfunding platform, if you raise funds, the following fees will be applied: 5% Indiegogo platform fee and payment processor fees (5% per  processor). Campaigns with bank accounts outside the US will also have a $25 bank transfer fee. The beneficiary bank of the project team will also charge its commission.</p>
<p>Therefore, about 11% of the funds raised will be spent on the compulsory payments.</p>

<p>Please note that all the PERKS will be dispatched to the backers after the official launch of the website, i.e. after 1 May 2017.</p>
<p>The PERKS with declared value will be redeemed after they are posted on the portal, and therefore the dispatch date of such goods may be substantially postponed from the above date. This condition fully applies to the category “Gratitude of the Society”.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Ways that you can help</strong></h2>
<p>If you like this idea, but its category is not the one that you would like to invest in - no problem! We would be grateful for any help from you - advice, practical assistance for implementation and, of course, sharing the information on this project in social networks. Perhaps your friends will get interested!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why should I help?</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the world where creative people can realize their potential, and other people can enjoy beautiful individual works of art is the best world. To feel that you are part of this is unspeakable joy!</p>
<p>When this project is implemented, we are sure thousands of artists will feel very much grateful that Leox.red, a powerful tool for personal growth, has been created by joint efforts and has taken up the majority of the problems associated with the promotion of such talents.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>We fully realize what risks and challenges we are facing. In order to become known and prove our competitiveness, we have to do more than our best. After all, the rules of the business environment have never forgiven mistakes.</p>
<p>Even though we have extensive experience in this field, we will always keep our doors open to new ideas and solutions. The flexibility of our business policy will consist in constant control over all our actions and prompt response to any difficulties encountered.</p>
<p>We will be pleased to accept advice from all the people who sincerely wish success to our business. Furthermore, we do need criticism, since sensible criticism and a hard-boiled appraisal of the situation only can become a basis for making right decisions!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What happens if we do not raise the required amount?</strong></h2>
<p>The amount specified here is the minimum we need to create such a portal. Therefore, we have launched a fixed goal campaign to raise funds, because no one wants to shamefully hide their eyes if we undertake to set up this business without having set the necessary funds in full and then fail to fulfill our promise. So, if we do not raise the required amount, all the money will be returned to the backers.</p>
<p>But if that happens, no one is going to sit on their hands. We will review our business model, improve it properly and continue to seek funds for its implementation.</p>
<p>At the same time, we believe that our idea of ​​creating a specialized portal for gifted creative people will find an echo in every man’s heart.</p>

Who are we?
Welcome, dear friends! You have paid attention to our project and it is already a success for us! However, the information below will also be of great interest to you, and you may also be feeling anxious about the implementation of this project, just the way I am.
Life is an art. Creating your own life, enjoying it and giving joy to other people is the way of a real human being.
No matter what form the art may take, its ultimate goal has always been the same - the development of the spiritual sphere of mankind through emotional content, the satisfaction of its desire for beauty.
But has anyone ever thought of how many obstacles there are between an author and humanity? How hard is it for a person who is really talented to show their works? Sometimes, it takes an artist longer than a lifetime to do that...
Did you know that Vincent Van Gogh died in 1890 and he had sold during his life only one painting for $109 (converted to the current purchasing power of the dollar)? He became popular only in 1920, i.e. 20 years after his death...
Paul Gauguin, Amedeo Modigliani, Franz Kafka, Emily Dickinson... This list can be continued. I think that the people who were deprived of the possibility to be represented timely and were recognized by society too late have slowed down the development of mankind.
It should have be written here that we are a small group of enthusiasts who admire art and would like to promote it. However, when I started working on this project, the people participating in it refused to do so, fearing the impossibility to compete with the existing portals. Nevertheless, I know for sure that competition has never harmed anyone, and therefore I am willing to see it through to the end and I am confident that with your help, this goal will be achieved.

I became interested in the arts about three years ago, when I tried my own hand at painting. To be honest, I failed completely, but I felt a great desire to help those people who are really good at art. Moreover, when I found out how many obstacles a young artist has in their way to recognition, this desire to help only grew stronger and stronger every day.
My major occupation is finance and law. I have worked for over 9 years in the field of business auditing, and therefore the control over business processes is something I have considerable experience in. At the moment, I am voluntarily assisted by my friends who I also consider to be professionals in their fields: managers, linguists, graphic designers and other people who would like to make this world a better place.
We believe that the popularization of art will be the driving force for this world.
 
What is Leox.red?
Have you ever created anything by yourself? And if so, what brought you joy: the fact of creating something new or the happiness of realizing that your work would be estimated at its true worth by others? I think the answer is: both.
And have you ever bought a really unique thing? What did you feel when you realized it was one of a kind? It is a great feeling and you know it.
Our goal is to create the largest trading platform in the world for the sale of hand-made art. This is what Leox is about.
We are not talking about famous artists only, who are already known and honored in their own countries and worldwide, but rather all the people involved in arts. Furthermore, we are talking about beginning artists, sculptors and craftsmen. We are sure that any work of art created with feeling will find its owner, even if there are thousands of kilometers between them.
And it does not matter what it is - an oil painting or a bracelet made of stones from the island coast where you dream to travel to.
Leox.red is a business run in compliance with the existing models which have been substantially transformed in order to achieve better results taking into account the demands and desires of the new open-minded generation in which we belong.
It may seem that globalization has affected all the spheres of our life, but if you look closer, you will see that it has had absolutely no effect on craft in general and works of art in particular. You can buy any factory-made (mass produced) thing in any corner of the world any time, and, at the same time, it is extremely difficult to do so with respect to unique products.
Leox.red is intended to change this situation and give the world this opportunity.
The concept of the portal
Leox.red is a trading platform where, in order to post their lot, an artist should pay either a fixed fee or a certain percentage of each sale (i.e. a flexible pricing policy for users). By lot we mean one item from an artist which may have a few photos. An artist is unlimited in the number of items posted, but the number of photos uploaded to the items is limited.
Having analyzed the market of similar trading platforms, having studied in detail the strengths and weaknesses of each player and having justly estimated what new and better Leox.red can give to each of the parties interested in the process of trading works of art, we can say with certainty that we do have something to offer to creative people to realize their fullest potential!
Please read more details below.
 
Do people really need this?
“By three methods we may learn wisdom: first, by reflection, which is noblest; second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.” - Confucius
 
In today’s world, we will have to use all the three methods, and the first one is reflection.
The major players existing in the world today in this sector are etsy.com,  artmajeur.com, saatchiart.com, artenet.es and milanuncios.com. They cover mainly English-speaking and Spanish-speaking users, and have some drawbacks, which we will discuss in the section “Global Market” below.
Such specialized websites do not exist in the Ukrainian and Russian segments of the Internet (there are over 240 million users in these segments in total). The main players in this location are trading platforms specializing in the sale of the most demanded categories of goods, i.e. typical bulletin boards.
In fact, Leox.red just alters dramatically (in comparison with other portals in this location) the so-called “forming the product range” to occupy its niche in the category “selling specialized products”. Therefore, while starting to develop our business, we accepted the hypothesis of the need for such a business as confirmed, but still, in order to reveal consumers and verify them further, we have conducted a comprehensive research of the market and its depth.
We have carried out a statistical monitoring of the potential sellers of goods in the social networks VK.com and FB (they were selected for the research, first of all, because of the large scale, and secondly, because the users are required to specify their hobby for the development of communication links), as well as analyzing the existing shopping portals.
For instance, on VK.com (as of 15 July 2016, its average daily audience is 64,525,950 visitors), the largest number of the people who specified “arts and crafts” as their hobby were in the categories: “Hand Embroidery” and “Hand Bead Embroidery” - the coverage of the top five such hobby groups was 980,705 people or 1.52% of the total audience. In the category “Hand-Painted Pictures”, the same selection indicator for the top five groups showed 316,488 people.
Since one person (no matter if he/she is an artist or just a person interested in art) is usually a member of about three of such groups simultaneously (but not more than four), the average number of the people interested in this topic was 393,088. This figure includes the people who like creating pictures (of all types) and the buyers of such pictures (who purchase certain finished paintings or order an artist to paint a particular picture), as well as potential buyers who have never made any deals before.
Every ninth person of the above number considers him-/herself to be an artist. Thus, the total number of artists in the top five such groups is 43,676 people. The majority of them are geographically located in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.
Important note. The average age of the users of this social network is 26 years. The users aged 35+ and 40+ are the minority in this network. However, they represent a huge amount of people interested in selling works of art.
As for Facebook, 1900 people from Ukraine have joined the active groups related to selling goods in the category “Oil Paintings” (7 largest groups), while in the categories “Hand Embroidery” and “Hand Bead Embroidery” - 5,385 people.
On the whole, in Ukraine alone, there are 5,864 people aged 19-26 years who create paintings at a level sufficient for selling.
These figures are also confirmed by the largest trading platforms in Ukraine - olx.ua and bigl.ua. For example, as of 21.11.2016, 38,220 ads were posted in the category “Paintings”, where one ad is one lot, i.e. one painting. Taking into account that, according to the above statistical surveys, one active artist always has more than 7 finished pictures and he/she posts on average 4 of them only, we can see that the total number of the artists who are actively selling their works in Ukraine are approximately 9,555 (4,170 of them are the people who are out of the age group of 19-26 years).
In Russia and Belarus, these figures were 28,394 and 2,714 people respectively. Another 3,013 people who have the potential to sell existing paintings are those who speak Russian but do not reside in the territory of these three countries.
As we see, Leox.red is in demand among young people, students and those who graduated from a high school no later than 5 years ago. It is the most active segment of the population in any country, the people who are looking for their place in this world and have something to offer to it. In order to make their dream come true, they have to show their works to as many potential buyers as possible, and opening a specialized portal for them would be akin to a breath of fresh air.
The second category of people who will be interested in Leox.red (they are fewer than the above) are older people who are already fulfilled, have sufficient experience and, most likely, well-established social connections to promote their works.
Economic indicators
We have set the break-even point for the project. It is the least real achievable goal under the worst conditions of attracting active artists. It will be 5 months after the launch date of the portal. It is the deadline that we must make as short as possible, and all our calculations are based on the worst market conditions. The pricing tactics for the rent of lots was calculated in detail and takes into account the psychological features of the selected category of customers, as well as the real quality of life in the countries where Leox.red will start operating.
Thus, in order to achieve the break-even point within the first 5 months since the portal launch, Leox.red is to encourage people to post 8,200 items per month (hereinafter referred to as “lpm”), i.e. to have approximately 2,050 registered artists with an average placement rate of over 4 lpm.
Actually, it means that at the first stage, we have to attract at least 4.7% of the local artists who are now posting their lots on other trading portals.
Therefore, any actions resulting in the exceed of 8,200 lpm will draw nearer the break-even point, while a smaller number of items posted will be extending the 5-month term.
At the same time, it is important to remember that up to this point we have been talking about the works of art in the category “Paintings” only. We have absolutely not considered the categories “Jewelry” and “Accessories”, which already have about 9,000 lots on the above trading platforms, as well as other categories, which do not exceed 5% in total of the category “Paintings” (i.e. approx. 1900 items).
To sum up, taking into consideration the information set forth above, we estimate the today’s width of the market of craft products in Ukraine alone as 49,120 lpm, in Russia - 141,970 lpm and in Belarus - 13,570 lpm.
Accordingly, the marketing campaign at the first stage will be focused simultaneously on the active artists of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.
At the same time, the goal of the campaign for Term 1 is to attract 17% of the users of other trading platforms in the category “Works of Art” in the three countries covered by Leox.red or numerically - 34,793 lpm.

 
Why is Leox.red better than others?
In the current situation, when there are players in the market who enable users to post ads for sale, it seems it is pointless to get engaged in this struggle. This is what I heard from my former colleagues over and over again. But that is not really true. I would like to assure you of our competitiveness.
I. Local market. What do the leading trading platforms offer in the countries where Leox.red will be presented during the first period?
All the trading platforms in the starting location can be subdivided for our purpose into the following two categories:
1. Those that offer to post items for free (free ads), such as: olx.ua, aviso.ua, avito.ru, objavlenij.net, rusale.net, irr.ru
2. Those that charge for posting items (ads with price formula), such as: bigl.ua, haubau.com.ua, meshok.net, megalot.com
First of all, it should be noted that the above platforms do not have “Art” as a separate category on their landing page, which complicates greatly the search for the items you need.
For instance, on OLX, the most popular trading platform for free ads in the domain .ua, (it is also one of the most popular trading platforms in the world, since it has portals in many countries, e.g. the US, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, China), the sale of works of art are hidden in the category “Antiques/Collections”, which is accessed through the section “Hobby, Recreation and Sports”.
Similarly, on bigl.ua, the most popular platform for “ads with price formula”, the sale of paintings can be found at the address: “Home and Garden” ® “Décor” ® “Paintings”.
Second, the above websites do not provide a more detailed categorization of art depending on the style in which they are created. This is logical, since you have already had to click four links in order to just find a list of paintings.
Third, the platforms for free ads rely on the number of visits to their page, which is why the main target audience of such websites is the buyers and sellers of cars, household appliances and computer equipment. The marketing strategy of these platforms is also based on the principle of not focusing on a specific target group. “Everything for everyone” is the basic principle of such websites. They get monetized by advertising, which often turns their pages into heaps of pop-ups and intrusive banners.
Fourth, even though the platforms for “ads with price formula” provide less advertising, they also focus on massive participation and, in addition to the fee for posting an item, they often charge a fixed percentage of the value of a posted item after its sale (hence the name of the type of such platforms, because this percentage paid by the seller to the trading platform is calculated by a specific formula for each category of goods). This approach is often not beneficial for the sellers of works of art compared to the sellers of factory-made products, who sell goods in large quantities. Leox.red is not going to charge the percentage of a deal.
Fifth and most important, the strategic goal of all the above websites is to cover as many users as possible within one country. They achieve this goal by increasing the number of the categories of goods sold and by attracting new users. The drawback of such a wide coverage is that the link “buyer-seller” does not work outside the country where the portal is registered due to the complexity of communication between the users, as well as due to the difference of customs procedures for different types of goods in different countries. In order to enter new markets, such companies have to register new entities in other countries, to recruit staff and do all the same thing - get deeper into the local market by attracting as many users as possible. Naturally, such actions result in the increase of the operating costs.
In contrast, we may define the position of Leox.red as “Unique for All” and plan to increase the number of users by a wider geographical coverage, rather than by a deep localization. The fee paid by the users to the portal will provide them with support and marketing services, as well as with the capability of selecting the amount of advertising on their pages. These services will be unavailable if the fee is not paid.
 
II. Global Market
The trading platform Leox.red will be designed in such a way that any information about an item entered will be automatically displayed to the users in the language they selected as the main one when entering the portal.
At the first stage, the platform will be offering its users to select one of the four languages available: Ukrainian, Russian, English and Spanish.
The major competitors are as follows:
- etsy.com – 40 000 000 lots and 104,509 artists 1.7M active sellers
- artmajeur.com - 1,820,182 lots and 104,509 artists
- saatchiart.com - 166,631 lots and 50,000 artists
- milanuncios.com - 50,617 lots and 15,338 artists
- artenet.es - 14,056 lots and 4,685 artists
The above platforms have some disadvantages. Leox.red plans to occupy a niche in this market by eliminating these disadvantages.
One of these drawbacks is charging an artist a percentage of the cost of their item sold (it should also be not less than a certain fixed amount), which is not profitable when selling low-cost paintings (cheaper than $200) (no flexible pricing policy).
Second. There is no sufficient marketing support of such portals in Russian speaking countries. The main buyers of paintings here are the collectors who found out about these websites through internal channels. The chain of selling paintings to design studios and directly to entities is extremely inefficient. It is impossible to single out some young artist here out of their total number.
Third. Only one of these websites (saatchiart.com) generates its own social life (exhibitions, meetings with authors, etc.), yet in English-speaking countries only. Leox.red is going to increase the coverage of such events.
 
Project implementation timing:
• Raising funds and (in case it is successful due to your help) transferring them to the project team - by 21 January 2017
• Incorporation of the company: 23 January to 31 January 2017
• All stages of creating the portal: 31 January to 28 April 2017
• Launching the portal: from 1 May 2017
• Reaching the break-even point: by 2 October 2017
 
What we need?
The most important thing in this category is to realize that Leox.red will be implementing finished business solutions, and accordingly, the cycles and stages of its formation will differ from the typical cycles of start-ups. Therefore, the costs will include the value of the product creation, expenses on setting up the company and the first marketing steps to enter the market.
Besides, of course, an operating enterprise needs the following monthly expenses (they are now planned in the cost of the project and will last until the break-even point of the enterprise): salary of the employees to be hired, costs associated with the maintenance of the portal and company for 7 months.
An important part of the costs will be the compulsory payments made to the platform Indiegogo.com and payment processor fees. According to the terms and conditions of the crowdfunding platform, if you raise funds, the following fees will be applied: 5% Indiegogo platform fee and payment processor fees (5% per  processor). Campaigns with bank accounts outside the US will also have a $25 bank transfer fee. The beneficiary bank of the project team will also charge its commission.
Therefore, about 11% of the funds raised will be spent on the compulsory payments.


* PERKS can be made immediately after the campaign.
** PERKS can be redeemed from the operating portal, i.e. after May 1
Social obligations:
3% of the amount collected will be allocated for direct support of people and organizations that help homeless animals in Kyiv region, Ukraine. After creating the website such payments will be increased and will be conducted on an ongoing basis.

 
What has already been done and what our team is doing at the moment
We have:
- created the concept of the portal and the statement of work to design it
- calculated the economic aspects of the portal’s pricing policy
- prepared all the legal documents needed to set up the company and run it
- created the graphical elements of the corporate design of Leox.red
We are:
- negotiating with the national postal operator of Ukraine about our future cooperation regarding postal delivery of the works of art
- developing a schedule of meetings with the students of art schools in Ukraine and the program of such events
- developing a schedule of meetings with business representatives interested to cooperate with our portal
 
PERKS!
All the PERKS will be delivered in original gift packaging.
Please note that all the PERKS will be dispatched to the backers after the official launch of the website, i.e. after 1 May 2017.
The PERKS with declared value will be redeemed after they are posted on the portal, and therefore the dispatch date of such goods may be substantially postponed from the above date. This condition fully applies to the category “Gratitude of the Society”.
 
Ways that you can help
If you like this idea, but its category is not the one that you would like to invest in - no problem! We would be grateful for any help from you - advice, practical assistance for implementation and, of course, sharing the information on this project in social networks. Perhaps your friends will get interested!
 
Why should I help?
We believe that the world where creative people can realize their potential, and other people can enjoy beautiful individual works of art is the best world. To feel that you are part of this is unspeakable joy!
When this project is implemented, we are sure thousands of artists will feel very much grateful that Leox.red, a powerful tool for personal growth, has been created by joint efforts and has taken up the majority of the problems associated with the promotion of such talents.
 
Risks & Challenges
We fully realize what risks and challenges we are facing. In order to become known and prove our competitiveness, we have to do more than our best. After all, the rules of the business environment have never forgiven mistakes.
Even though we have extensive experience in this field, we will always keep our doors open to new ideas and solutions. The flexibility of our business policy will consist in constant control over all our actions and prompt response to any difficulties encountered.
We will be pleased to accept advice from all the people who sincerely wish success to our business. Furthermore, we do need criticism, since sensible criticism and a hard-boiled appraisal of the situation only can become a basis for making right decisions!
 
What happens if we do not raise the required amount?
The amount specified here is the minimum we need to create such a portal. Therefore, we have launched a fixed goal campaign to raise funds, because no one wants to shamefully hide their eyes if we undertake to set up this business without having set the necessary funds in full and then fail to fulfill our promise. So, if we do not raise the required amount, all the money will be returned to the backers.
But if that happens, no one is going to sit on their hands. We will review our business model, improve it properly and continue to seek funds for its implementation.
At the same time, we believe that our idea of ​​creating a specialized portal for gifted creative people will find an echo in every man’s heart.

<h3>Why Lebanon and Bet Chabab?</h3>
<p>Creating with clay, one of earth's most abundant raw materials, is an ancient process. Clay has been used to create household objects as well as purely aesthetic work.</p>
<p>Pottery requires skill, it always puts you in front of surprises, every type of clay holds its color and its characteristics and consequences after being heated to perfection. It is a long and continuous dialogue with nature , it is the art of knowing the material and dealing with them and controlling them by giving them shape and color.</p>
<p>Archaeologists have unearthed pottery up to 3,000 years in southern Lebanon that ancient Phoenicians used to bury the remains of the dead after cremation. The pottery dates to between 700 and 900 BC when Phoenician traders flourished on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. Originating from what is now Lebanon, the Phoenicians were early seafarers who spread their culture to other countries around the region.</p>
<p>The village of Bet Chabab is located at 30Km from Beirut (Capital Of Lebanon), and is home to the timid survival of this ancient prosperous craft. Here ,Fawzi Fakhouri, The Pottery Man of beit Chabab, is the last remaining craftsman, who makes pottery the Beit Chabab's way, a way unique in the entire world, that combines the use of the pottery wheel together with a natural clay roll.</p>
<p>He creates each by hand, with a very difficult technique and involves hard manual labour.</p>

<h3>Hello, nice to meet you! This is me, all me and some extra</h3>
<p>My name is Tessa and art is in my veins. I could not live without it, even if I wanted to. But luckily that is far from what my plans are anyway.</p>
<p>My story started when I was a little child. Why play with toys when you have pencils at your disposal? I drew for hours and hours every day. Eventually, it could really not be avoided, I went to art school but sadly I could never complete this due to unforseen circumstances. Sometimes live just goes like that but that does not mean giving up is an option.</p>
<p>I kept developing the valuable skills I had learned and today I am proud of what I have achieved. Never have I felt so ready to start selling the art that I create: fantasy and realistic art (portraits), sometimes combined, in several media types combined: both traditional and digital. I did certainly not sit still and you could say that I am a chameleon.</p>
<p>But although I am motivated and a hard worker, I could really use a little boost to get started. People around me keep telling me that there is no harm in asking for help and that there are some wonderful souls out there. That is why I am putting my trust in them and everyone reading this request. </p>

<h3>Back to the point and an insight on goodies</h3>
<p>The funds requested will be used to buy an Epson DS-50000 scanner. It is only the top of the iceberg but, in essence, it is what I need to get the ball rolling. This scanner will allow me to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scan art so I can promote myself better on social platforms and my own website</li>
<li>Once I have a quality scan, I can start selling originals. Based on how popular they are already, I don't expect issues with that.</li>
<li>I will be able to reproduce my art: quality prints, stickers, bussiness cards, promotional material, ... and a random act of kindness every now and then.</li>
<li>Sell digital copies of my art</li>
<li>Offer tutorials and rewards on Patreon</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that I don't reach the funding goal, I will put any funds collected aside and keep saving until I reach the goal by other means. I have a fulltime job and with careful budgetting I can keep some money aside. It would take a very long time but with faith and a goal in mind, anything can be achieved!</p>
<p>Now if the kindness of strangers was to stun me and I would collect more than the requested amount, all funds would go to the same main goal: building up a professional business. Being an artist is so much more than buying a few brushes, some paint and a canvas. For example, these days social media is an incredible important part of being an artist. And with it comes the need for professional recording and photo equipment.</p>
<p>Perk, perks, perks, ... yes, you read that correct! A lot of perks have been created for this campaign and they are all ready to go. Get ready to feast on original and unique art. And where possible, I will even keep everyone's preferences in mind. But keep in mind: since the originals are unique, only one of each exists so don't miss your chance!</p>

<h3>A dream that keeps on giving</h3>
<p>In case this wasn't obvious yet: becoming a professional artist is not just a goal but also a dream. But it doesn't stop there! Art can bring hope, make people dream, warm a heart, make a soul ponder. I have so much more to give and these are just a few of the things that I can share with the world. In return for your support, I will work even harder so your effort will not be wasted.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Now I understand that some people would love to help me out but are simply not able to contribute financially with the best will in the world. The fact that you already have this wish warms my heart more than you will ever know. But did you know there are also other ways you can support me?</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>You can share this campaign on your social media: spam away on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, your blog, ... and spread the word. Indiegogo even has a special share tool for just that purpose. I am not a big fan of spamming but you have my seal of approval this time. OK, I admit, I might even enjoy it to some degree.</li>
<li>Get your friends and family involved. The more the merrier! I am sure that someone owes you a favour and is dying to be released of that commitment. (Especially the people who want to repay it and you never asked for it. Here is your solution!) Or you are a lovely soul who just likes to do nice things. In both cases I would already like to express my grattitude anyway.</li>
<li>I am not saying that I want you to go to the end of the world for me. Just dropping my name here and there can do wonders. Don't worry, it doesn't break.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When I started Sweet Charlotte’s a year ago,..</h3>
<p>I had only one vision in mind.... to make enough money to be able to stay home with my daughter. A few months into that, I realized I wanted to do more. I wanted to open up a store that could help other small businesses and/or women going through what I was.</p>
<p>I opened up a store and soon realized there was so much more I could do... if I only had the tools to do it.<br/><br/>I am looking to relocate, renovate, and expand Sweet Charlotte’s Boutique. I want it to become a community based shop (even more so than it is now). I currently have nearly 100 other small businesses that display their work in my shop and I’ve worked with quite a few charities and nonprofits, but I want to do more.<br/><br/>Everyone deserves a creative outlet. Kids deserve to grow up around art. People deserve to reach their potential and succeed. </p>
<p>I want to make that happen, but I can’t do it all alone.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Money raised during this will go towards the expansion and creating craft rooms and nights out for single mothers and their kids, animal rescues, firehalls, community nonprofits, and for my current and future artists to master their craft and excel.</span></p>
<p>Things that are needed and will be paid for from this fundraising include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>-A new and bigger retail space<br/>-New Laptop<br/>-New security system<br/>-Tables, chairs, microwaves, easels, and dishes for craft nights.<br/>-Couches, dressers, shelving, and other display items for our artists.<br/>-Paint, brushes, wood, string, and other craft supplies.</p>
<p>Nothing in life comes free. <br/>Every donation will get something back as my way of saying “Thank you!” Check out the perks of every donation on the right hand side of the screen!<br/><br/>If all the money we need is not raised, the money that is, will be used to buy as much of the things needed as possible1</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Art matters. Art has the ability to save lives. Art has the ability to send someone to college, to better their future. Why not help make that happen. We used our store as a means to raise almost $1,000 just in one fundraiser for an animal rescue in as little as 4 hours. We CAN make a difference, we all can help.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge right now is securing a space. All the other things can wait, but this cannot. My current lease is up soon, and this location does not have the space I need. If we do not find a space sooner than later, this won’t be able to happen. I have looked at several new places, but there are always other companies able to scoop them up quickly. I have the perfect place in mind, my heart is set on it and I KNOW you all would love it, but I can’t make this a reality, without YOU.</p>

</div></div>","When I started Sweet Charlotte’s a year ago,..
I had only one vision in mind.... to make enough money to be able to stay home with my daughter. A few months into that, I realized I wanted to do more. I wanted to open up a store that could help other small businesses and/or women going through what I was.
I opened up a store and soon realized there was so much more I could do... if I only had the tools to do it.I am looking to relocate, renovate, and expand Sweet Charlotte’s Boutique. I want it to become a community based shop (even more so than it is now). I currently have nearly 100 other small businesses that display their work in my shop and I’ve worked with quite a few charities and nonprofits, but I want to do more.Everyone deserves a creative outlet. Kids deserve to grow up around art. People deserve to reach their potential and succeed. 
I want to make that happen, but I can’t do it all alone.

What We Need & What You Get
Money raised during this will go towards the expansion and creating craft rooms and nights out for single mothers and their kids, animal rescues, firehalls, community nonprofits, and for my current and future artists to master their craft and excel.
Things that are needed and will be paid for from this fundraising include, but are not limited to:
-A new and bigger retail space-New Laptop-New security system-Tables, chairs, microwaves, easels, and dishes for craft nights.-Couches, dressers, shelving, and other display items for our artists.-Paint, brushes, wood, string, and other craft supplies.
Nothing in life comes free. Every donation will get something back as my way of saying “Thank you!” Check out the perks of every donation on the right hand side of the screen!If all the money we need is not raised, the money that is, will be used to buy as much of the things needed as possible1

The Impact
Art matters. Art has the ability to save lives. Art has the ability to send someone to college, to better their future. Why not help make that happen. We used our store as a means to raise almost $1,000 just in one fundraiser for an animal rescue in as little as 4 hours. We CAN make a difference, we all can help.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge right now is securing a space. All the other things can wait, but this cannot. My current lease is up soon, and this location does not have the space I need. If we do not find a space sooner than later, this won’t be able to happen. I have looked at several new places, but there are always other companies able to scoop them up quickly.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Greetings from SuperEarth!</h3>
<p>Hey! Rob Feldman here, writer, creator and illustrator of Cyko KO (PSYCHO-KAY-OH), a popular newsprint comic book series through Alterna Comics.  I've been writing and drawing Cyko KO for over 3 years now through Alterna, after its successful run on Line Webtoons as one of the first digital animated comics. It's an all-ages, fun Saturday morning type of comic inspired by the  early days of Hanna Barbera and Filmation.  Out of the three newsprint issues so far, both 1 and 2 are in their second printings! Additonally, Cyko KO was nominated for a Ringo Award in 2018 and I have 3 more issues due to hit shelves this year.  Here's an intro video with me and some cool intro music:</p>
<div>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/t0uKXT4vClw"" width=""560""></iframe></div> </div>
<h3>
<br/>Who's this now and what does he do?</h3>
<p>If you haven't heard of Cyko KO (PSYCHO-KAY-OH), he's an infectiously fun character that is great for kids and adults of all ages. He's a fourth-wall breakin', pinball-addicted, motorcycle-ridin' hero you've been waiting for! From the pages of the popular Alterna Comics newsprint series by Rob Feldman, I'm looking to turn Cyko into a 6-inch vinyl action figure, complete with 7 points of articulation (prototype does not show knees bending, but final figure will) and an awesome collectible. Here are some of the comics available through <a href=""https://www.alternaaccess.com/product-page/cyko-ko-1-of-3-2nd-printing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alterna Comics</a>:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557112652/hlbvdx8i5x640qwhtvui.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As a backer, you have the chance to receive not only your only blister card packaged copy, but also get some cool perks, one of which includes an opportunity to see your name and possibly your likeness in print!  I've priced the perks carefully and hope that you will consider backing this project.</p>
<h3>You need my money for what now?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Producing an action figure is not an easy task, but I just know you'll love the results.  This is the second figure I have produced (the first being a <a href=""http://www.drshroud.com/toy_big2.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Shroud figure</a>) and understand what it takes to get it from concept to your hands.  I am working with an overseas company who has already produced this awesome sample:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557112550/kztctdg20a9qvgl0bffs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Where will the money go?</h3>
<p>To get more of these done, at least 500, complete with packaging, will cost around $6,500.  This includes the mold ($3,500), production, packaging and shipping and roughly takes about 6-8 weeks for full delivery. I figured that it's an all or nothing thing since we need to hit certain production minimums so if we don't hit the goal, we can just go our separate ways and call it quits.  Which would be awful!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557113434/xxfriftdlnaqshsqpihy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I have some cool perks here---of course you can get the figure, or two or three.  BUT since Cyko KO is going strong on Alterna's newsprint line, there are Perks to get the comics, stickers, a SuperEarth Action certificate and even a shoutout or your a walk-on role in one of the upcoming books!  That's right, I'll put you in the crowd or even go so far as to work on a character for one of the future comics coming out this year or next, deadline dependent of course. Plus, I have some awesome stretch goals planned if we hit the mark, like variants, more articulation and even an alternate suit! Here's the packaging mockup (not the final design):</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557153080/pu7wd5aaeiqpxc3gfx1q.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">(above graphic is a mockup only and not final)</p>
<p>This is a chance to have a unique collectible!  Heck, even if you haven't read the books---and you should---I think Cyko KO as a figure, even to hold and cherish, is something worth working for! <strong>NOTE: Prototype does not show articulation in the knees, but final figure will have 7 points of articulation!</strong></p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>There are some really fun Perks here---stickers, an Action Club Membership and even a chance to be in the comic!  Here are some visuals to help you out:</p>

For all tiers that include an action figure, you'll get an 11x17 poster of Cyko KO #1, signed by creator Rob Feldman!

 

 
Greetings from SuperEarth!
Hey! Rob Feldman here, writer, creator and illustrator of Cyko KO (PSYCHO-KAY-OH), a popular newsprint comic book series through Alterna Comics.  I've been writing and drawing Cyko KO for over 3 years now through Alterna, after its successful run on Line Webtoons as one of the first digital animated comics. It's an all-ages, fun Saturday morning type of comic inspired by the  early days of Hanna Barbera and Filmation.  Out of the three newsprint issues so far, both 1 and 2 are in their second printings! Additonally, Cyko KO was nominated for a Ringo Award in 2018 and I have 3 more issues due to hit shelves this year.  Here's an intro video with me and some cool intro music:

 

Who's this now and what does he do?
If you haven't heard of Cyko KO (PSYCHO-KAY-OH), he's an infectiously fun character that is great for kids and adults of all ages. He's a fourth-wall breakin', pinball-addicted, motorcycle-ridin' hero you've been waiting for! From the pages of the popular Alterna Comics newsprint series by Rob Feldman, I'm looking to turn Cyko into a 6-inch vinyl action figure, complete with 7 points of articulation (prototype does not show knees bending, but final figure will) and an awesome collectible. Here are some of the comics available through Alterna Comics:

As a backer, you have the chance to receive not only your only blister card packaged copy, but also get some cool perks, one of which includes an opportunity to see your name and possibly your likeness in print!  I've priced the perks carefully and hope that you will consider backing this project.
You need my money for what now?

Producing an action figure is not an easy task, but I just know you'll love the results.  This is the second figure I have produced (the first being a Dr. Shroud figure) and understand what it takes to get it from concept to your hands.  I am working with an overseas company who has already produced this awesome sample:

Where will the money go?
To get more of these done, at least 500, complete with packaging, will cost around $6,500.  This includes the mold ($3,500), production, packaging and shipping and roughly takes about 6-8 weeks for full delivery. I figured that it's an all or nothing thing since we need to hit certain production minimums so if we don't hit the goal, we can just go our separate ways and call it quits.  Which would be awful!

I have some cool perks here---of course you can get the figure, or two or three.  BUT since Cyko KO is going strong on Alterna's newsprint line, there are Perks to get the comics, stickers, a SuperEarth Action certificate and even a shoutout or your a walk-on role in one of the upcoming books!  That's right, I'll put you in the crowd or even go so far as to work on a character for one of the future comics coming out this year or next, deadline dependent of course. Plus, I have some awesome stretch goals planned if we hit the mark, like variants, more articulation and even an alternate suit! Here's the packaging mockup (not the final design):

(above graphic is a mockup only and not final)
This is a chance to have a unique collectible!  Heck, even if you haven't read the books---and you should---I think Cyko KO as a figure, even to hold and cherish, is something worth working for! NOTE: Prototype does not show articulation in the knees, but final figure will have 7 points of articulation!
Perks
There are some really fun Perks here---stickers, an Action Club Membership and even a chance to be in the comic!  Here are some visuals to help you out:

<h3>Passion Behind the Product</h3>
<p>If we simply focus our attentions, we’d notice seniors all around us. This time of the year can get hard for them. Some have lost loved ones already or some simply don’t have anyone to visit them. We at Thoughtfuls have recognized there is a need and have taken the initiative for everyone to make positive changes in sad places.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>“Pick a problem, and do something about it. Because to a person that is hurting, something means the everything.”</i></p>
<p>                                                                        -<strong><i>Oprah Winfrey</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s remarkable how many first responses are close to identical when first hearing about Thoughtfuls. It’s usually along the lines of: “ we all know the seniors are there and in need, but they’re so often misplaced in the background of everyday life.” People are caring by nature; we know hearts genuinely bleed for the elderly. That’s why we take pride when people show appreciation for providing a service that allows that need for love to be sent and received.</p>

<h3>Flowers in a Greeting Card With the Perfect Smell.</h3>
<p>As a professionally trained artist and designer, and also someone who has battled the depths of depression. I knew the cards had to be more than a card you pick up at the shop. For some of the people receiving them, this will be the first thing they've been sent in a very long time. So the card had to be so unexpectedly wonderful that I could guarantee, at the least, a smile. With gold leafed envelopes, laser cut frames, and real flower with such a perfect scent; I understand why we sold so many so quickly.</p>

How will this benefit me ?</strong></p><p>Ultimately, the quality of our relationships to others is one of the things that impacts our lives the most. The NQA is a psychological product rather than just an item. It won't save you any money, it won't save you any time, but it will change your life. It's beauty is that it allows you to make a beautiful gesture for somebody and helps you really connect. These occasions present themselves rarely nowadays.</p><p><strong>3. What can you do with it ?</strong></p><p>Make grown men and women cry, in the best way.</p><p>After the part where you offer it to someone, the NQA is made to be a beautiful addition to any home. This way every now and then they will see it and remember they have at least one great person in their lives. A small reminder that you are not alone through rough times is a very big deal.</p><p><strong>4. Why are you doing this ?</strong></p><p>We've been designing and building machines for a living for over 5 years. The NQA from our point of view is the best ""change the world machine"" we could think of. It may look like just a fun gift, but the truth is our world is made out of many people with many different relationships. The NQA is made to increase the quality of relationships, people that are more secure about their connections are stronger and more productive. In 10 years the NQA will change the world.</p><p><strong>5. What materials is everything made of ?</strong></p><p>The tokens are made of tombac (bronze), treated with silver and patina in different ways to obtain the 4 looks.</p><p>The special tokens are made of silver and gold.</p><p>The Polaris box is made of faux leather, we don't harm animals.</p><p>The Sirius box is made of linden wood, for each box we will plant a new tree</p><p>The token supports are made of flexible epoxy resin in our workshop</p><p><strong>6. Are the colors as they appear in the campaign ?</strong></p><p>All representations are highly accurate. In the case of the tokens, pictures don't do them complete justice, they look slightly different depending on how the light lands on them. You'll be pleasantly surprised. </p><p>Sirius Silver is identical to Lyra, the only difference is that it's completely made of silver, not only treated on the surface.</p><p>Sirius Gold, none of these have been made yet, but we can assure you they will be spectacular.</p><p><strong>7. What are the limitations of the engravings ?</strong></p><p>Our engravings are top of the line, only a handful of companies have a laser precise enough to engrave our tokens. The wooden engravings are made on painted linden wood with 2 coats of lacquer. Once complete, the engravings are covered with acrylic paint to give them an awesome look. </p><p><strong>Tokens</strong></p><p>Each token can be engraved with up to 62 characters, arranged over 3 rows. One of the most exotic tokens we've had was: ""For the one who was between the footprints and the bull's tail""</p><p><strong>Letter</strong></p><p>The highest common character count is ~1000. A smaller text is also good, we will arrange it to look great. Slightly larger texts can also be used.</p><p>When making a beautiful text engraving, nice paragraphs are a big part of the deal, thus character or word counts, don't really say much. You have a  160 mm / 100 mm canvas to play with. </p><p>A good approximation is writing 1 page in Google docs with a font of 20.</p><p>Don't forget, we help with both writing and drawing and will send you a rendering of how things will look.</p><p>When preparing a drawing, keep in mind that the NQA engraving is only colored with one color, thus any drawing needs to be transformed to monochrome before engraving. We will handle the editing, but you have to pick an image that is suitable, think of a black tattoo for example.</p><p><strong>8. How do you support us in writing?</strong></p><p>If you purchase any form of NQA we will send you a small list of questions that will help you think of something nice to write.</p><p>If you wish, we will take a look over your answers and come up with a few texts for you, we're quite good. If you wish we can even set a small call to sort it out.</p><p><strong>9. What are the sizes and weights ?</strong></p><p><strong>Token:</strong></p><p>Diameter 42mm</p><p>Thickness 4.2mm</p><p>Weight ~42g for the tombac version (the silver and gold versions are heavier)</p><p>Yes it's the answer to everything, and it's made that way on purpose.</p><p><strong>Polaris:</strong></p><p>Box: 80x80x25 mm</p><p><strong>Sirius:</strong></p><p>Sirius box: 180x120x60 mm</p><p><strong>10. Where is everything manufactured ?</strong></p><p>The NQA is made 100% in the EU, materials come from Italy and Romania. All engravings tokens and final assembly are done in Bucharest Romania (that's where we're from, we're also not vampires).</p><p><strong>11. Why crowdfunding ?</strong></p><p>As we mentioned before, we really want people anywhere in the world to have a chance to enjoy our invention and, you know, make the world a better place together. To launch something world-wide we need a minimum number of orders outside of the EU to allow for effective shipping. Crowdfunding is the best way for us to do this. </p><p><strong>12. What's the deal with the Cymbiogen NQA ?</strong></p><p>The entire idea for the NQA project began from a contest we held with our friends for obtaining our company name, Cymbiogen. Whoever gives us a winning idea gets a favor, No Questions Asked, no expiration date. </p><p>We figured it may be a fun thing to add for people who hope to see the NQA succeed. If you ever need our help, you'll have it, No Questions Asked, any time, any place. It's in our best interest to hold true to our word. We hope to have some interesting adventures with these in the future. </p><p><strong>13. When does shipping begin ?</strong></p><p>If it looks like this campaign will be successful we will immediately begin production. This means we will be able to begin shipping the NQA ~ 1 week after the campaign ends.</p><p>We are very confident you will have yours before Christmas.</p><p><strong>14. Taxes</strong></p><p>Every country has different rules and regulations, so we can't specify these values for everyone. We can specify that</p><p>There are no additional taxes or costs in the EU.</p><p>In the US we have deals in place with fulfillment companies to remove any extra expenditure from our pioneers.</p><p>If you live somewhere else there may be other taxes involved.</p><p><strong>15. Interested in a distribution partnership ?</strong></p><p>By all means, we are very happy to get the NQA into as many hands as possible if you'd like to help, contact us.</p><p><strong>16.

NQA on the way
 Sirius - The NQA at full powerWhen there's a lot that needs to be said, Sirius is the way to go. With Sirius you can get even the most complex and personal message through. Here's our movie, there's better movies out there, but this one's ours and it tells the story of what we think the ultimate NQA is and does. Why we need itThere's an invisible wall between us, we lose ourselves in misunderstandings and meaningful moments are forgotten in the blink of an eye.Sometimes you need to speak about life, friendship and love. These talks don't come by often, there's never time, there's never the right mood, you need that one more shot of something first...The wall is a concept that encompasses all psychological phenomena which cause us to not talk or not listen, from the typical introvert awkwardness to listening filters and the upper limit problem. The wall is everywhere and it needs to go. Sirius is here to help you break the wall and to get your message through.  Once the wall is broken, it stays brokenWhen assembled, the NQA becomes a timeless reminder of your victory at keeping your connection alive.  Take the element of surprise to a whole new levelSirius has an additional element to sweep them off their feet.On the back of the cover there's a hidden letter. The cover is designed so that when opened, the letter will not be seen. You have to tell them when to read it. Express yourself freelyYou can use the letter to write down everything you have to say in any language. If words are not enough, you can even use pictures. It's a great way to immortalise a valuable memory you share. The hidden letter is the icing on the cakeYou can tell your family what they mean to you.You can tell someone who taught you a valuable lesson, just how much it mattered. You can even write your significant other how much and why you love them.From experience, if your message comes from the heart, by the time they finish reading it, teary eyes begin to show.By the end you'll look like these guys How it works

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Why in the world do artists have to wait till they are discovered by some art gallery or be appreciated for their talent by a few to be recognized?</p>
<p>The more, we researched we found that there were no platforms where interviews or documentaries on emerging artists could be found. Sure, when an artist had become “famous” or was “dead” then documentaries were made upon them, but the question was what can I do to make positive change, after all, is not art what makes this world a better place.</p>
<p>Having found no platform for documentaries on artists, I decided to create one. Portrait and -gram which means a way of doing something resulted in Portragram, a vessel/platform for portraits on artists.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As a film director, facing challenges was not new, having spent thousands of dollars to develop this project, I had no regrets, I was happy to start a project to give a voice to artists. But, I want to do more.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to do at least one documentary a month. This would mean that every month, Portragram can feature one artist to tell their story and give a voice to the artist.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>THESE ARE FILMS FOR CHANGE. While these films are of artists, they are more than just documentaries; they are a chance for CHANGE where the artists can now have an opportunity to tell their stories, speak about their art. These films do more than explaining the artist’s point of view; they let artists be recognized for their talent and art instead of being at the mercy of art galleries. So far I've used all my saving to promote this project, now, I need your help to help artists by continuing these documentaries featuring one artist every month.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>This is a non-profit project. We give our time and use our limited equipment to make these short documentaries without expecting anything in return. But there are other costs like editing, light technician, colorist, sound mastering. We are asking you to help us with covering these costs.</p>
<p>WE ARE LOOKING TO RAISE 20K (that is one video a month for 6 months/6 artists). Eventually, we want to do one video a month for a year. This is the bare minimum amount needed to pay sound and light technician, film colorist, editor, and cover mastering the sound.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can help us by spreading the word about Portragram project to give artists a voice. By sharing on your social platforms you are helping to make it happen. </p>

<h2><strong>WHY THIS BOOK?</strong></h2>
<p>A UNICEF survey of children aged nine to 18 in 14 countries showed that children are deeply concerned about global issues affecting their peers and them personally, including climate change. Children feel marginalized because their voices are not being heard, or that their opinions considered. There is a need for the government, development partners and civil societies, private sector, households, and academia to continue to invest in sustainable energy needs that put children first. We are exploring the use of knowledge transfer in partnership with several actors to help children, significantly the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, benefit from these investments, and have a voice within this process. Given the enormity of the climate challenge, it is surprising how limited coverage of our changing climate receives in current children's fiction. After all, children will be responsible for the future protection of our fragile planet. So their knowledge and engagement are critical. Children can better understand global issues, engage in critical inquiry about themselves globally, and combine narrative structure with information to take children beyond and expand their knowledge of difficult scientific concepts such as climate change. They can be inspired to make a difference in the real world, just like Greta Thunberg. We need children to care about  the planet and understand the givings if they are to tackle the climate challenge that lies ahead. Storytelling can raise awareness and inspire children and young adults to act and become the next generation of Earth warriors.</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>This book is based on my childhood experiences , true life stories  and present challenges in Nigeria, Africa, by extension. So, it is not entirely fiction. The book has been extensively researched. The co-author, Tenn Zipa, has extensive experience in writing children's books. This book secondarily teaches gender equality,  and leadership attitudes which children need to understand during their formative years. </p>
<h3><strong>Catch them young, they say. This is what we plan to do with the book. </strong></h3>
<p>Through literature, children can explore different perspectives and actions beyond what they know by living in the story world of characters for whom they care. Children can better understand global issues, engage in critical inquiry about themselves globally, and combine narrative structure with information to take children beyond and expand their knowledge of difficult scientific concepts such as climate change.</p>

<p>It is never too early to teach your children about developmental issues and how they can contribute to change. This book aims to turn such a scary subject into information that can inspire and steer children in a productive direction.  Stories develop children's literacy and help convey beliefs, attitudes, and social norms, which, in turn, shape children's perceptions of reality. They allow children to move from a position of powerlessness to a place of possibility.  Through literature, children can explore different perspectives and actions beyond what they know by living in the story world of characters for whom they care. We aim to make these children champions of clean energy and environmental sustainability. We need children to care about the planet if they are to tackle the climate challenge that lies ahead. Storytelling can raise awareness and inspire children and young adults to take action and become the next generation of Earth warriors.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Hence, the need to publish a book for children that can effectively teach children the effects of energy poverty, renewable energy and environmental sustainability in a bid to deliver and secure sustainability. </strong></p>

<h3>Supporting this book and REES Africa</h3>
<p>There is severe energy inequality even when it comes to electrification. Everyone deserves the energy trilemma for access to dignity and opportunity. These most vulnerable and marginalised set are basically in the middle of nowhere -widening the inequality creating energy apartheid- creating a two-tier energy system – energy abundance in the Global North  and tiny solar lamps or nothing for these vulnerable Global South. These people are left behind and forgotten in the race to fulfilling UNIVERSAL energy access by 2030. The Global South is not the culprit of climate change, but are the most vulnerable people facing climate change issues and are at more disadvantage if they keep destroying rural landscape by burning biomass. </p>
<p>We are launching a new project tagged under the REES Africa tagged the ‘The SDG Literacy Drive' to launch the book and sensitize primary/junior secondary schools in the six  geopolitical zones across Nigeria on SDG 7 and SDG 13, donating at least 2000 copies to their libraries.  At the end of the sessions, the students will be able to assemble a solar lamp or upcycle plastics into creative art.  Kids will be provided with materials and in line with the exercises in the book, will be involved in  DIY projects that will be beneficial to their immediate environment. </p>
<p>Other activities to be carried out include ;</p>
<ul>
<li>Immediate Community Clean-ups and provision of waste bins</li>
<li>Tree planting</li>

<p><i>Why is this campaign important to me? </i>Describing yourself is never easy. Figure exposing yourself in front of a large audience. Getting shy, hm?

<p>Art is a beautiful shape of expression, allowing you to expand those voices and letting yourself be heard. As an artist and sponge that I believe I am, art not only helps the maker but most clearly the viewer as well. This is important because we are in an era of lacking expressiveness and I am a strong believer this exhibition will help erase repression and expand views beyond the imaginary.</p>

Even when the observer stays the same, the artwork will look different over time as we inevitably age and experience life.At no single moment in time will the artwork be alike another, and may only be considered complete with an observer at its heart.It is not “I think, therefore I am” but “I see this work, therefore I am complete”. Like a stage does not exist without its protagonist, there is no meaning to life without your existence. I hope to convey this message through the mirrors I incorporate in my works.#Butterfly & BambooWe usually call a straightforward person ’upright’. However, a straightforward person is considered too stiff, too prim, too proper. On the other hand, someone who obsesses on what is beautiful is considered too dissolute, too lazy, too idle. These two things seem like two rabbits you lose if you chase both.In my work, the butterflies symbolise ‘beauty’ and the bamboo represent ‘uprightness’. Through the harmonious way the butterflies flutter through the field of bamboo, I wanted to show that ‘beauty’ and ‘uprightness’ can also work together in people.#Breaking the Frame
Breaking out of familiarity is difficult: waking up early, exercising an hour a day, eating less. Routines end up shaping us but imprisoning us from trying something new. I wanted to break out of my frame of habits, stubbornness and fixations. This is what my broken frames signify.# Spreading the message1. Protagonist’s Badge Black/ Yellow/ Pink (3.2cm)2. Protagonist’s Hand-Mirror Black/ Pink (6.8cm)
 3. Protagonist’s Calendar 2018 [15X23(h)cm]
A mini-portfolio calendar to enjoy the works of Tommy Seo.The vertical design saves table-space and includes a functional mirror.The perfect calendar for your office or study desk.4. Protagonist’s Eco-bag
 5. Protagonist’s Mirror ArtworkA broken frame is incorporated to convey the message: “Break the Frame”.We are producing a special limited edition of original works for this project.Nothing is printed but personally created by the artist so no two works are the same (therefore size, type and positioning of butterflies and bamboo will differ for every mirror).There are 15 limited rewards per colour. 6.

<p>Submitting your URL/Text for your QR Code will happen during the last 2 weeks of the campaign and after. Email us after 20 September. We'll email you when the campaign end (successfully).</p>
<p>More QR Code will be made available during the campaign if the current QR Code PERKS are taken. The GOLD QR Code will arrive near the end of the campaign. The PLATINIUM after the campaign.</p>(*) Once you receive your poster, you will need to activate it. This means it might not work and you'll need to solve the first puzzle to make it work. (A kid 6 years old will find the solution.</div><div>
<h3>The game, puzzles and mysteries.</h3>
<p>Imagine a giant crossword. So you have to find words and you only have clues located in the poster or on the website at a module location. You know the exact amount of letters of each word. Some clues or hints are everywhere on my various websites, in the updates, on the social networks of TMDP...</p>
<p>The video below illustrates in brief the type of puzzles you have to find. Later I'll give more examples.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>Fixed Funding</h3> <p>It's all or nothing. If the goal isn't reached. No poster will be made!</p>
<p>If 1 million cents are reached (aka $10.000) the poster will be printed!</p>
<ul> </ul>
<div>
<h3>The Updates</h3>
<p>I will update you on the finish of the paper and printing method during the campaign.<br/></p>
<p>I hope to make the funny enough and hide some stuff for you in it. What? Do you think the game hasn't started? There will be clues, JOKERS (see below), Easter Eggs, hints everywhere. In the campaign, on the websites, on other places of the internet, in the real world.</p>
<p>It's simple, the higher the success, the more fun it will be and the better the poster and the website... The whole experience of TMDP.</p>
<p>I'll also show you soon how hard or how far you will have to level up your brain to find solutions to the puzzles. I'll show you a previous conceptual art project.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>In the Press</h3>
<p>See all press related on the <a href=""http://www.themilliondollarposter.com/p/press.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website here</a>. Below a few important who understand the potential of the project.</p>

<div>
<h3>The Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>I'll update this section during the campaign and announce it in other updates.</p>
<p><b>SG 1</b>: The Color poster. It's possible and I only need to calculate the extra cost of it to plan the level of this goal. Color means more fun in the puzzles, means selected QR Codes can be in one or more colors. In brief, the poster will look nicer to look at and easier to find QR Codes.</p>
<p><b>SG 2</b>: I'd like to offer a new reward of a large poster in 1189*841 mm but still waiting for the cost of printing and shipping.</p>
<p>... Ideas of SG ? Suggest some!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><b>SG ?</b> Super gamification : More puzzles, better interactive website. An app?</p>
<p><b>SG Final</b> : 1 million dollar TATTOO + Celebrate the biggest Belgian Crowdfunding campaign.</p>

</div></div>","The Final poster It will be a giant QR code on a 24*36 inch poster. This means the QR code will be around 23 inches/60cmwide. It will be 37 by 37 blocks (called modules) this means +-16mm for each squared tiny QR Code that is embedded. 80% of the smartphones can scan/read a 15mm one. So most of the smartphones will work.


The Rewards / Perks



The poster. See on the right what perk suits you. Special shipping or more than 2 to ship? Email me. hi@themilliondollarposter.com

The PDF will only be the giant QR Code with the embedded tiny QR Codes. So it's a square without title or special data or info (*). It will be activated




Be in the poster with a QR Code. This means in the poster. You can provide your own if you want. I'll make it based on Black and White and as simple as possible using a URL shortener depending on the length of the URL. If text, the max characters is 120 (QR Code version 5, 37*37 modules) and if you really want more it could go to 150 characters (QR Code version 6, 41*41 modules). Each QR Code must not direct to anything offensive or illegal. Email if in doubt.



Submitting your URL/Text for your QR Code will happen during the last 2 weeks of the campaign and after. Email us after 20 September. We'll email you when the campaign end (successfully).
More QR Code will be made available during the campaign if the current QR Code PERKS are taken. The GOLD QR Code will arrive near the end of the campaign. The PLATINIUM after the campaign.(*) Once you receive your poster, you will need to activate it. This means it might not work and you'll need to solve the first puzzle to make it work. (A kid 6 years old will find the solution.
The game, puzzles and mysteries.
Imagine a giant crossword. So you have to find words and you only have clues located in the poster or on the website at a module location. You know the exact amount of letters of each word. Some clues or hints are everywhere on my various websites, in the updates, on the social networks of TMDP...
The video below illustrates in brief the type of puzzles you have to find. Later I'll give more examples.

  Fixed Funding It's all or nothing. If the goal isn't reached. No poster will be made!
If 1 million cents are reached (aka $10.000) the poster will be printed!
 

The Updates
I will update you on the finish of the paper and printing method during the campaign.
I hope to make the funny enough and hide some stuff for you in it. What? Do you think the game hasn't started? There will be clues, JOKERS (see below), Easter Eggs, hints everywhere. In the campaign, on the websites, on other places of the internet, in the real world.
It's simple, the higher the success, the more fun it will be and the better the poster and the website... The whole experience of TMDP.
I'll also show you soon how hard or how far you will have to level up your brain to find solutions to the puzzles. I'll show you a previous conceptual art project.

In the Press
See all press related on the website here. Below a few important who understand the potential of the project.




The Stretch Goals
I'll update this section during the campaign and announce it in other updates.
SG 1: The Color poster. It's possible and I only need to calculate the extra cost of it to plan the level of this goal. Color means more fun in the puzzles, means selected QR Codes can be in one or more colors. In brief, the poster will look nicer to look at and easier to find QR Codes.
SG 2: I'd like to offer a new reward of a large poster in 1189*841 mm but still waiting for the cost of printing and shipping.
... Ideas of SG ? Suggest some!
...
SG ? Super gamification : More puzzles, better interactive website. An app?
SG Final : 1 million dollar TATTOO + Celebrate the biggest Belgian Crowdfunding campaign.

Risks & Challenges
As this is my first webtoon and indiegogo, it is always a risk whether I can get enough funding. If I can’t reach my funding goals, I plan to apply for grants. I am a skilled grant writer in my day job so this can reduce risk for supporters. 
One risk is that the printed edition will not look like how you expect. To alleviate that I will post updates about how the books look like via Instagram, Facebook, and Indiegogo.
Another risk is that the products may be damaged through shipping. I will pack everything to reduce this risk as much as possible. If anything is damaged through shipping, I will try my best to support while also making sure I have enough funds to make Lunar Rainbow a reality.

I work in a design studio I founded called Urania Press. I have curated and designed TAROT CHIMERA, bringing the beguiling Symbolist art of Odilon Redon to contemporary Tarot. The deck is interpreted from a “chimeric” perspective, encouraging transformation through art and divination, deepening our connection to our dark and light identities, dreams, mysteries, and the realms of spirit.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631568028/xvd73ihfiqr94iaej61c.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> <i>Chimeras are creatures of the imagination that carry dreamers away.</i></p><p>     As an animist, it is my philosophy that everything in this world is imbibed with a spirit. I believe the 19th-century French lithographer, painter, and pastellist Odilon Redon knew this on a profound level and sought to invoke chimeric spirit into all his sublime visions, turning his solitude, dream-filled imagination, and weird and uncanny intrigues into art.</p><p>     In 2020 I was called to curate and digitally enhance Redon’s art (that is over 140 years old) aligning it to the Major and Minor Arcana. I interpreted the cards in the style of the traditional Rider-Waite-Smith system, and I chose in some instances to depict cards with gender-neutral characters and non-heterosexual couples. I have also designed 10 additional Oracle cards as part of the campaign’s Stretch Goals, which will make a total of 88 cards.</p><p>     TAROT CHIMERA is a divination tool for self-knowledge that allows its user to tap into a unique chimeric nature through the boundless imagination and universal mysteries of what I call Odilon Redon’s “Arcana”: his dark, mystical and magical archetypes and symbols, with the intention to shed luminous light onto our path, face personal demons, transmute negative energies, foster expansive realities, revealing the hidden aspects of self that need transforming or alternatively would benefit from being acknowledged and bravely expressed.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631566415/jsy8ayepeduiedlkcbap.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631635281/vjhrjdm94jw1xrgkdbwp.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631635633/ggzny5g7kupwkli38qds.png"" src=""""/></p><p>     As an undergrad for my Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, I worked in the Art library and discovered a magnificent book by Philippe Jullian called Dreamers of Decadence about the Symbolist artists of the fin de siècle 1890s. The book’s overarching theme is that of the Chimera, no longer a hybrid monster of Classical myth, but an archetype of the Symbolist’s manifesto of metaphorical and symbolic imagery and mystical and hermetic ideals, created as reactions against rationalism and matter-of-fact realism. Symbolist works of art and literature elevate the elemental and sublime in nature, the mystique of the feminine, symbolic dreams, the occulted subconscious, decadence, Romantic ideals, and the fantastic vagaries of the imagination. I loved the paintings and prints by Fernand Khnopff, Gustave Moreau, and Jean Delville, which appealed to my Gothic sensibilities. In particular, I felt a personal affinity with the artist Odilon Redon (1840-1916).<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631566565/xzum9yclgd0gtdywmez2.jpg"" src=""""/>      Redon’s prints, particularly his collection called Noirs, were dark and uncanny, and steeped in the otherworldly. Alfred Werner, the writer of The Graphic Works of Odilon Redon explains: “Art enabled him to channel the demoniacal forces from the depths of his self into well-integrated, well-designed images that, despite their astounding aspects, console and comfort with an amazingly soothing lucidity.” It was this aspect to Redon's artwork that left a lasting impression on me.</p><p>     While being home due to Covid, I stumbled across an old journal where I had pasted Xeroxed copies of Redon’s prints and noticed one image that resonated as ideal for the Tower card in the Tarot deck. I did a Google search and discovered much of Odilon Redon’s artwork was in the Public Domain. For all of 2020, I searched museum archives matching Redon’s enigmatic imagery to the Tarot. The cards fell into the Arcana so perfectly it was as if Redon’s spirit was giving me the “go-ahead” to bring his work into the divination context. TAROT CHIMERA was born. After six months of searching for just the right fit, digitally enhancing in Photoshop around 100 Redon images, repairing poor quality museum scans in need of repair, and adjusting the final 78 (plus 10 Oracles) to the Tarot card format, I then began the second phase of this project: composing a Companion Guidebook interpreting the deck from a “chimeric” mythos and perspective.</p><p> “I must also have a dark side if I am to be whole.”  – Carl G. Jung </p><p>     The Arcana of Odilon Redon seeks the ancient paths of sympathetic magic and dreams in order to find the balance between the conscious and the subconscious levels to reframe difficulties and channel beneficial forces for growth and transformation. It is a meditation tool for unlocking personal truth through myth and the metaphysical, symbolism, acknowledging the value of the shadow, and intuition.    </p><p>     Through self-awareness and looking deep within, interacting with the chimeric nature of a given situation has the potential to help the querent navigate aspects of the darker expressions of self. Through honing in on the chimeric within a given thought, action, or experience, a conversation can arise and beneficial information can be attained. Perhaps banishments of trickster spirits are in order, or, alternatively, there may be alliances ready to be made for positive outcomes.</p><p>      A true visionary, Odilon Redon, from the inner depths of psyche, dream, and the unconscious, rendered deep shadow and luminous light (tenebroso and chiaroscuro) into an assortment of mysterious beings and unknown forces: mystical figures of the ancient world, ancestral apparitions, charmed objects, hybrid figures (chimeras), phantoms, amorphous microbes and bacteria, disembodied heads, winged-beasts, angels, Sun gods, Buddhas, cyclops, sphinx, spiders, snakes, skulls, skeletons, dice, sentient flora and monstrous fauna, martyrs wearing crowns of thorns, shining stars and luminaries, and eyeballs floating as hot-air balloons.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631566600/oefzy5dzsurgbes8h0ph.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>     When drawing a single TAROT CHIMERA card, or laying out a spread, it is hoped that an affinity is inspired by Redon’s enigmatic visions and that the querent will find the chimerae charming and soothing, relevant, divinatory, and transformative, while placing, as the Symbolist artist explained of his work, “the logic of the visible in the service of the invisible.”</p><h3><strong> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631635664/lrbrx3ndqnj8kyesoxbn.png"" src=""""/></strong></h3><p><strong>78 Large Tarot Cards: 22 Major Arcana Cards and 56 Minor Arcana Cards</strong></p><p><strong>Dimensions: 75mm x 130mm (2.95 inches x 5.12 inches)</strong></p><p><strong>Printed on heavy, casino-quality Playing Card stock with an embossed Linen finish, assuring easy shuffle and wear resistance</strong></p><p><strong>Keywords Mini Booklet (fits in Tuck Box)</strong></p><p><strong>Beautiful Tuck Box printed on matte premium cardstock </strong></p><p><strong>Manufactured by Legends Playing Card Company LPCC</strong></p><p><strong>Embossing and Gold Foil designs on Tuck Box</strong></p><p><strong>Designer “First Edition” Tuck Box Stamp Seal </strong></p><p><strong> 10 Oracle Cards (The ""Visionary"" Oracle is designed as a Urania Press brand card.)</strong></p><p> Note: the Companion Guidebook has in-depth interpretations matching each of the 78 cards and the 10 Oracles, aligning them to the Rider-Waite-Smith system.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631635695/uadcfixnrlagke9qevzi.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>MAJOR ARCANA ~</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631566874/fkheilftz6skixrlohqt.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>MINOR ARCANA ~</strong></p><p><strong>Suit of Wands:</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631566942/w12y7e6l0jcasjrobbj6.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><strong>Suit of Cups:</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631566963/mrdvcho4b08peipjcsyz.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><strong>Suit of Swords:</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631567019/qmkllyqtu99yigrexzux.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Suit of Pentacles:</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631567052/q3upoilkov6925lppkui.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><strong>The additional 10 ORACLE Cards:</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631567256/lvpjqjmvzzz3ym50uadm.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631567282/we401tbmznw9zcy51bux.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Chimeric beings are nature spirits in every way</i></p><h3> </h3><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631635738/xsk8giocsql4xncteyzq.png"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631567348/hrihb9itanfbueuxo6ro.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p>     The charming card back is a double-ended format designed from Odilon Redon’s print ""Perversité"" (1891).

It is a creature of strength and cunning representing a symbolic and mystic connection with wild feminine energy. The Chimera is a conduit of fantastic dreams that can be embodied and cultivated within. Ambiguous, baneful, and seraphic, its form is both attractive and repulsive: “she is a promise of the Ideal, with the body of a carnivorous beast,” explained the French Symbolist painter Gustave Moreau.</p><p>     The word “chimera” comes from the Greek meaning “she-goat.” In the Middle Ages, the Chimera was considered an ill omen of natural disasters and came to symbolize toxic views of women as “wicked.” A more enlightened contemporary conception understands the Chimera as the reconciliation of both the bold and brazen aspects of the feminine: (passionate and seductive, femme fatale, links with the underworld, mystery, intuition, the subconscious, drawn to temptation, perversity, liberation, impulsive, willful, and capricious), integrated with the aspects of the feminine that embody the personification of nature, love and beauty, nurture, sensuality, sympathy, generosity, and kindness.</p><p><strong>Classical conceptions of the Chimera:</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631567426/nvuoffg8huh7z2th1i5x.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><strong>19th Century Symbolist Chimeras:</strong></p><p>      The 19th century fin de siècle Symbolist artists exalted the Chimera. They painted Les Chimères in many imaginative variants, evoked from the inner depths of dream and the unconscious. A plethora of numinous and liminal forces, untamable creatures, delightful follies, melancholic beauties, tricksters, spirits, entities, and beasts: winged horses, unicorns, satyrs, sphinx, angels, merfolk, gods and goddesses, sentient plants, disembodied heads, ancestral apparitions, and delightfully capricious bacteria.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631567462/ek3wt7cgey2dubgvdyal.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>     The key to embodying the Chimera is non-repression of the senses, embracing healthy decadence by being enthused by life, and establishing a deep affinity with both masculine and feminine energy and the primordial powers that have existed since ancient times. We become Chimeric transfigurations when we encourage the full archetypal spectrum of the feminine, cultivating a visceral and intuitive connection to this world and the elemental spirits of the earth through sensory perception, which is a revolt against Materialism, in favor of animism, the spirit in all things, capturing dreams and fantasy, and beginning to thrive and be of service to ourselves and others.</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631635804/zfsncr3uw6dpwvrafdc2.png"" src=""""/></h3><p>     Odilon Redon was born on the 20th of April 1840 in Bordeaux, Aquitaine. In 1864 he studied painting in Paris, and later in Bordeau, he took up sculpting as well as instruction in etching and lithography with the engraver Rodolphe Bresdin. In 1870 Redon was drafted to serve in the army in the Franco-Prussian War. After the war, he moved to Paris and created works primarily in charcoal and lithography, producing his Noirs of rich, velvety blacks and luminous whites. Redon regarded the color black as “an agent of the spirit far more than the fine color of the palette or the prism.” </p><p>     Fairly unknown in fin-de-siècle Paris, Redon hadn’t yet become a celebrated figure until 1878 when he gained critical attention with his print Guardian Spirit of the Waters, and in 1879, with the publication of Dans le Rêve, his first album of lithographs. In 1884 he shot to fame when his drawings were celebrated in the brilliant cult novel of Decadence À rebours. (Against Nature) by Joris-Karl Huysmans. During the 1890s, Redon was very much inspired by the literary works of Charles Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe, and Huysmans, and he was a regular among the artists and writers who gathered at Symbolist poet Stéphane Mallarmé's home and salon. After 1900 he produced work in pastel and oils, abandoning his Noirs for the colors of the prism, and his chimeras were now chromatic.</p><p>     In 1903 the French government gave Odilon Redon the Legion of Honor. He continued to exhibit widely. 1916 was the year of his passing.</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631635831/xizklf9rburlk74psswy.png"" src=""""/></h3><p>     Late nineteenth-century Symbolism was a literary movement and new manifestation in Art following heroic Romanticism, whose French, Russian, and Belgian artists rallied against humdrum Realism, puerile Naturalism, and an Impressionism they felt didn’t rouse the imagination. At the close of the century, Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, Arthur Rimbaud, Paul Valéry, Joris Karl Huysmans, and Paul Verlaine affirmed the symbolist conception in literature and poetry, while Gustave Moreau, Odilon Redon, Félicien Rops, Jean Delville, Jan Toorop, Fernand Khnopff, Aubrey Beardsley, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, and others, became the art movement’s nexus of visionaries.</p><p>     In Symbolism these artists saw a new outlook that opposed the rise of science, was a reaction against mediocrity and exalted the spiritual over the material while finding refuge in fantasy and medieval and Renaissance symbolism. The Symbolist was a loner-artist, outside of society, they followed the desires of their hearts and minds, creating art through expressions of intuition, imagination, the Ideal, melancholy, decadence, myth, dream, mysticism, the occult, and the otherworldly — all qualities that inspired twentieth-century Surrealists thirty years later.</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631635847/nkylx350nx6ikjk6pge0.png"" src=""""/></h3><p>     TAROT CHIMERA card art is edge-to-edge in color. Keeping to the integrity of Odilon Redon’s vision, I have digitally enhanced his artwork due to the fact that the files straight from the museum archives and libraries were not of optimum photo quality. I have optimized their contrast, line quality, sharpness, saturation, hues and tones, while coaxing the chiaroscuro light even more. Most of the cards were sourced from Redon’s black and white “Noir” collection. However, a few of the artworks originally in color I have turned into warm and cool duotones to match the overall feel of the deck. </p><p>     To ensure they are a better fit for the tarot card symbolism and meaning, I have altered by collaging 10 of the 78 cards, using ONLY Redon’s original imagery, (I have put a star asterisk in the Companion Book next to those cards to signify where creative collaging has been done.)</p><p>     With the 7 of Pentacles card, Redon depicted a large dice seeming to grow on a plant-like structure. I added a few more dice and more stems and leaves to mimic the traditional Rider-Waite-Smith depiction of seven Pentacles growing on a bush:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631567571/muh3xuambc8e6zcnyeeg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>     With the Temperance card, I wanted to depict the Angel holding two incense censers much like the R-W-S angel who holds the two cups, so in Photoshop I collaged in an extra censor and a hand holding it:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631567594/zo6ijk50cznp241dlsvx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>     The Odilon Redon prints have been sourced from museum photographs and scans that have been made available to the public domain (often in low resolution). Most were very obscure in dark tones and blurry, and I worked hard to enhance the contrast, black line quality, and sharpness to all. Here is an example of one of the original museum scans that I designed as the Death card. You can see the original is dark and the horse is barely visible.

I work in a design studio I founded called Urania Press. I have curated and designed TAROT CHIMERA, bringing the beguiling Symbolist art of Odilon Redon to contemporary Tarot. The deck is interpreted from a “chimeric” perspective, encouraging transformation through art and divination, deepening our connection to our dark and light identities, dreams, mysteries, and the realms of spirit. Chimeras are creatures of the imagination that carry dreamers away.     As an animist, it is my philosophy that everything in this world is imbibed with a spirit. I believe the 19th-century French lithographer, painter, and pastellist Odilon Redon knew this on a profound level and sought to invoke chimeric spirit into all his sublime visions, turning his solitude, dream-filled imagination, and weird and uncanny intrigues into art.     In 2020 I was called to curate and digitally enhance Redon’s art (that is over 140 years old) aligning it to the Major and Minor Arcana. I interpreted the cards in the style of the traditional Rider-Waite-Smith system, and I chose in some instances to depict cards with gender-neutral characters and non-heterosexual couples. I have also designed 10 additional Oracle cards as part of the campaign’s Stretch Goals, which will make a total of 88 cards.     TAROT CHIMERA is a divination tool for self-knowledge that allows its user to tap into a unique chimeric nature through the boundless imagination and universal mysteries of what I call Odilon Redon’s “Arcana”: his dark, mystical and magical archetypes and symbols, with the intention to shed luminous light onto our path, face personal demons, transmute negative energies, foster expansive realities, revealing the hidden aspects of self that need transforming or alternatively would benefit from being acknowledged and bravely expressed.                          As an undergrad for my Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, I worked in the Art library and discovered a magnificent book by Philippe Jullian called Dreamers of Decadence about the Symbolist artists of the fin de siècle 1890s. The book’s overarching theme is that of the Chimera, no longer a hybrid monster of Classical myth, but an archetype of the Symbolist’s manifesto of metaphorical and symbolic imagery and mystical and hermetic ideals, created as reactions against rationalism and matter-of-fact realism. Symbolist works of art and literature elevate the elemental and sublime in nature, the mystique of the feminine, symbolic dreams, the occulted subconscious, decadence, Romantic ideals, and the fantastic vagaries of the imagination. I loved the paintings and prints by Fernand Khnopff, Gustave Moreau, and Jean Delville, which appealed to my Gothic sensibilities. In particular, I felt a personal affinity with the artist Odilon Redon (1840-1916).      Redon’s prints, particularly his collection called Noirs, were dark and uncanny, and steeped in the otherworldly. Alfred Werner, the writer of The Graphic Works of Odilon Redon explains: “Art enabled him to channel the demoniacal forces from the depths of his self into well-integrated, well-designed images that, despite their astounding aspects, console and comfort with an amazingly soothing lucidity.” It was this aspect to Redon's artwork that left a lasting impression on me.     While being home due to Covid, I stumbled across an old journal where I had pasted Xeroxed copies of Redon’s prints and noticed one image that resonated as ideal for the Tower card in the Tarot deck. I did a Google search and discovered much of Odilon Redon’s artwork was in the Public Domain. For all of 2020, I searched museum archives matching Redon’s enigmatic imagery to the Tarot. The cards fell into the Arcana so perfectly it was as if Redon’s spirit was giving me the “go-ahead” to bring his work into the divination context. TAROT CHIMERA was born. After six months of searching for just the right fit, digitally enhancing in Photoshop around 100 Redon images, repairing poor quality museum scans in need of repair, and adjusting the final 78 (plus 10 Oracles) to the Tarot card format, I then began the second phase of this project: composing a Companion Guidebook interpreting the deck from a “chimeric” mythos and perspective. “I must also have a dark side if I am to be whole.”  – Carl G. Jung      The Arcana of Odilon Redon seeks the ancient paths of sympathetic magic and dreams in order to find the balance between the conscious and the subconscious levels to reframe difficulties and channel beneficial forces for growth and transformation. It is a meditation tool for unlocking personal truth through myth and the metaphysical, symbolism, acknowledging the value of the shadow, and intuition.         Through self-awareness and looking deep within, interacting with the chimeric nature of a given situation has the potential to help the querent navigate aspects of the darker expressions of self. Through honing in on the chimeric within a given thought, action, or experience, a conversation can arise and beneficial information can be attained. Perhaps banishments of trickster spirits are in order, or, alternatively, there may be alliances ready to be made for positive outcomes.      A true visionary, Odilon Redon, from the inner depths of psyche, dream, and the unconscious, rendered deep shadow and luminous light (tenebroso and chiaroscuro) into an assortment of mysterious beings and unknown forces: mystical figures of the ancient world, ancestral apparitions, charmed objects, hybrid figures (chimeras), phantoms, amorphous microbes and bacteria, disembodied heads, winged-beasts, angels, Sun gods, Buddhas, cyclops, sphinx, spiders, snakes, skulls, skeletons, dice, sentient flora and monstrous fauna, martyrs wearing crowns of thorns, shining stars and luminaries, and eyeballs floating as hot-air balloons.     When drawing a single TAROT CHIMERA card, or laying out a spread, it is hoped that an affinity is inspired by Redon’s enigmatic visions and that the querent will find the chimerae charming and soothing, relevant, divinatory, and transformative, while placing, as the Symbolist artist explained of his work, “the logic of the visible in the service of the invisible.” 78 Large Tarot Cards: 22 Major Arcana Cards and 56 Minor Arcana CardsDimensions: 75mm x 130mm (2.95 inches x 5.12 inches)Printed on heavy, casino-quality Playing Card stock with an embossed Linen finish, assuring easy shuffle and wear resistanceKeywords Mini Booklet (fits in Tuck Box)Beautiful Tuck Box printed on matte premium cardstock Manufactured by Legends Playing Card Company LPCCEmbossing and Gold Foil designs on Tuck BoxDesigner “First Edition” Tuck Box Stamp Seal  10 Oracle Cards (The ""Visionary"" Oracle is designed as a Urania Press brand card.) Note: the Companion Guidebook has in-depth interpretations matching each of the 78 cards and the 10 Oracles, aligning them to the Rider-Waite-Smith system.MAJOR ARCANA ~MINOR ARCANA ~Suit of Wands:Suit of Cups:Suit of Swords:Suit of Pentacles:The additional 10 ORACLE Cards:Chimeric beings are nature spirits in every way      The charming card back is a double-ended format designed from Odilon Redon’s print ""Perversité"" (1891). Isn’t she alluring with her coy, over-the-shoulder glance! What secrets will she be whispering as you shuffle through your TAROT CHIMERA cards?The Chimera is a mythic hybrid creature of antiquity depicted with the body of a lion, with both a goat and lion’s head and a serpent’s tail. It is a creature of strength and cunning representing a symbolic and mystic connection with wild feminine energy. The Chimera is a conduit of fantastic dreams that can be embodied and cultivated within. Ambiguous, baneful, and seraphic, its form is both attractive and repulsive: “she is a promise of the Ideal, with the body of a carnivorous beast,” explained the French Symbolist painter Gustave Moreau.     The word “chimera” comes from the Greek meaning “she-goat.” In the Middle Ages, the Chimera was considered an ill omen of natural disasters and came to symbolize toxic views of women as “wicked.” A more enlightened contemporary conception understands the Chimera as the reconciliation of both the bold and brazen aspects of the feminine: (passionate and seductive, femme fatale, links with the underworld, mystery, intuition, the subconscious, drawn to temptation, perversity, liberation, impulsive, willful, and capricious), integrated with the aspects of the feminine that embody the personification of nature, love and beauty, nurture, sensuality, sympathy, generosity, and kindness.Classical conceptions of the Chimera:19th Century Symbolist Chimeras:      The 19th century fin de siècle Symbolist artists exalted the Chimera. They painted Les Chimères in many imaginative variants, evoked from the inner depths of dream and the unconscious. A plethora of numinous and liminal forces, untamable creatures, delightful follies, melancholic beauties, tricksters, spirits, entities, and beasts: winged horses, unicorns, satyrs, sphinx, angels, merfolk, gods and goddesses, sentient plants, disembodied heads, ancestral apparitions, and delightfully capricious bacteria.     The key to embodying the Chimera is non-repression of the senses, embracing healthy decadence by being enthused by life, and establishing a deep affinity with both masculine and feminine energy and the primordial powers that have existed since ancient times. We become Chimeric transfigurations when we encourage the full archetypal spectrum of the feminine, cultivating a visceral and intuitive connection to this world and the elemental spirits of the earth through sensory perception, which is a revolt against Materialism, in favor of animism, the spirit in all things, capturing dreams and fantasy, and beginning to thrive and be of service to ourselves and others.     Odilon Redon was born on the 20th of April 1840 in Bordeaux, Aquitaine. In 1864 he studied painting in Paris, and later in Bordeau, he took up sculpting as well as instruction in etching and lithography with the engraver Rodolphe Bresdin. In 1870 Redon was drafted to serve in the army in the Franco-Prussian War. After the war, he moved to Paris and created works primarily in charcoal and lithography, producing his Noirs of rich, velvety blacks and luminous whites. Redon regarded the color black as “an agent of the spirit far more than the fine color of the palette or the prism.”      Fairly unknown in fin-de-siècle Paris, Redon hadn’t yet become a celebrated figure until 1878 when he gained critical attention with his print Guardian Spirit of the Waters, and in 1879, with the publication of Dans le Rêve, his first album of lithographs. In 1884 he shot to fame when his drawings were celebrated in the brilliant cult novel of Decadence À rebours. (Against Nature) by Joris-Karl Huysmans. During the 1890s, Redon was very much inspired by the literary works of Charles Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe, and Huysmans, and he was a regular among the artists and writers who gathered at Symbolist poet Stéphane Mallarmé's home and salon. After 1900 he produced work in pastel and oils, abandoning his Noirs for the colors of the prism, and his chimeras were now chromatic.     In 1903 the French government gave Odilon Redon the Legion of Honor. He continued to exhibit widely. 1916 was the year of his passing.     Late nineteenth-century Symbolism was a literary movement and new manifestation in Art following heroic Romanticism, whose French, Russian, and Belgian artists rallied against humdrum Realism, puerile Naturalism, and an Impressionism they felt didn’t rouse the imagination. At the close of the century, Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, Arthur Rimbaud, Paul Valéry, Joris Karl Huysmans, and Paul Verlaine affirmed the symbolist conception in literature and poetry, while Gustave Moreau, Odilon Redon, Félicien Rops, Jean Delville, Jan Toorop, Fernand Khnopff, Aubrey Beardsley, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, and others, became the art movement’s nexus of visionaries.     In Symbolism these artists saw a new outlook that opposed the rise of science, was a reaction against mediocrity and exalted the spiritual over the material while finding refuge in fantasy and medieval and Renaissance symbolism. The Symbolist was a loner-artist, outside of society, they followed the desires of their hearts and minds, creating art through expressions of intuition, imagination, the Ideal, melancholy, decadence, myth, dream, mysticism, the occult, and the otherworldly — all qualities that inspired twentieth-century Surrealists thirty years later.     TAROT CHIMERA card art is edge-to-edge in color. Keeping to the integrity of Odilon Redon’s vision, I have digitally enhanced his artwork due to the fact that the files straight from the museum archives and libraries were not of optimum photo quality. I have optimized their contrast, line quality, sharpness, saturation, hues and tones, while coaxing the chiaroscuro light even more. Most of the cards were sourced from Redon’s black and white “Noir” collection. However, a few of the artworks originally in color I have turned into warm and cool duotones to match the overall feel of the deck.      To ensure they are a better fit for the tarot card symbolism and meaning, I have altered by collaging 10 of the 78 cards, using ONLY Redon’s original imagery, (I have put a star asterisk in the Companion Book next to those cards to signify where creative collaging has been done.)     With the 7 of Pentacles card, Redon depicted a large dice seeming to grow on a plant-like structure. I added a few more dice and more stems and leaves to mimic the traditional Rider-Waite-Smith depiction of seven Pentacles growing on a bush:     With the Temperance card, I wanted to depict the Angel holding two incense censers much like the R-W-S angel who holds the two cups, so in Photoshop I collaged in an extra censor and a hand holding it:     The Odilon Redon prints have been sourced from museum photographs and scans that have been made available to the public domain (often in low resolution). Most were very obscure in dark tones and blurry, and I worked hard to enhance the contrast, black line quality, and sharpness to all. Here is an example of one of the original museum scans that I designed as the Death card. You can see the original is dark and the horse is barely visible. I did my best to enhance Redon’s artwork from their original, not-so-perfect scans. I feel they all turned out great and hope you do too!          The Tuck Box will be printed on matte premium cardstock.

<p>Having used mindfulness as a technique for dealing with stress, my idea was to create a series of badges that might encourage a more positive outlook and get people interested in trying meditation, or appeal to those who already use it. As a fan of Lovecraft, I thought Cthulhu would be a fun and unusual character to try to convey the importance of trying to relax. I hope it will appeal to Lovecraft fans and will make people smile. The badges will be 38mm. </p>

<h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>

<p>The target is £600 to cover the cost of manufacturing and posting 3 x 50 badges. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>This is a flexible goal and if the project doesn't reach the target:</strong></h3>
<p>At £200 badge #1 will be manufactured and posted </p>
<p>At £400 badge #2 will also be manufactured and posted</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An example: If backers pledge on three badges (£16) and the project only reaches £200 to unlock the first badge, then the backer will only pay the cost of 1 badge (£6) and will be refunded the rest.  If the project doesn't reach £200, then no badges will be made.</p>

Short Summary
My name is Patrick Brooks and I am a children's book illustrator and writer. www.psbrooks.com
Here are some of the books I have worked on:  

 
Having used mindfulness as a technique for dealing with stress, my idea was to create a series of badges that might encourage a more positive outlook and get people interested in trying meditation, or appeal to those who already use it. As a fan of Lovecraft, I thought Cthulhu would be a fun and unusual character to try to convey the importance of trying to relax. I hope it will appeal to Lovecraft fans and will make people smile. The badges will be 38mm. 
 
Badge 1: Focus on the present. You are awesome!

 
 
Badge 2: Breathe calmly. Let go of negativity.

 
 
Badge 3: Be kind to yourself and the world.

 
 
What I Need & What You Get

The target is £600 to cover the cost of manufacturing and posting 3 x 50 badges. 
 
This is a flexible goal and if the project doesn't reach the target:
At £200 badge #1 will be manufactured and posted 
At £400 badge #2 will also be manufactured and posted
 
An example: If backers pledge on three badges (£16) and the project only reaches £200 to unlock the first badge, then the backer will only pay the cost of 1 badge (£6) and will be refunded the rest.  If the project doesn't reach £200, then no badges will be made.

<p>Project Transformations is the inaugural project ran by Dr Tuuli Bell and Elizabeth Jenner for the Sister Sister Network and Arise 2020.</p>
<p>Using traditional painting and drawing methods this project will invite the attendees of Arise 2020 to sit alongside sculptural works and create free hand drawings. Opening a creative dialogue, in a task that some may have never experienced. These creations will be collected and documented by Tuuli and Elizabeth, reimagined and transformed into a singular, collaborative piece.</p>

<p>ARISE Summit 2020, a 200-attendee conference organised by the Reading-based Sister Sister Network, which is a Women’s Leadership Network launched in 2013. </p>
<p>At ARISE 2020, we are situated after the registration desk, so that those who arrive early can have a connecting experience with other guests from the very start of the day. The guests can take inspiration from sculptures situated in the middle of the space, and draw their interpretations, on paper. Once they are finished they can throw their work into the sculptures bases; and enter the main conference feeling creatively renewed. The workshop is a great way for people with different backgrounds to become equals; a safe space to break the ice and start communicating with other conference participants.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the conference, a digital image created using the participants work, curated by Elizabeth and Tuuli will be shown through a projection. A story of the days conversations is read as the projected image enters the stage.</p>
<p>By transforming the initial works of the participants, we use this visual metaphor, to highlight the importance of conversation and collaboration at Arise 2020. </p>

<h3>Hello,</h3>
<p>My name is Nibras and I retired recently. Now that I have retired, I want to fulfil a long-time ambition to study ceramics. I am proud that I was offered a place on the BA ceramic design course at Central Saint Martins college in London (I didn’t think I can make it to CSM). I had to submit a portfolio of art work for the application. It wasn't an easy task after working in a technical field for a long time. Luckily it was a success. However, I have to find £9,250 to pay the annual fees in order to take my place on the course. This is where I need your help as I don’t qualify for a grant or a student loan. Before I retired, I worked in IT. IT is a creative and interesting field, but I now need to work with my hands and produce three dimensional objects. I was at an interview for a ceramic course and the interviewer asked me what I did; when I replied I worked in IT she said, well then you need to muck in. So I need to muck in and get my hand dirty.</p>
<p>I want to prove that it is never too late to go back to education and learn a new skill. If you have the passion you can do it.</p>

<p>I'm going to DesignerCon!  I am raising <strong>$5000</strong> to cover the cost of inventory production, display supplies, packaging materials, convention fees, artwork frames, and more.</p>
<p>This is a <i>super exciting</i> opporunity for me, but in order to put my best foot forward at the show, I need your help!  Join in on the MADNESS by selecting a perk to the right, or scroll down for more information.</p>

</div><div>
<p>According to their website, “DesignerCon is an annual art and design convention that smashes together collectible toys and designer goods with urban, underground and pop art!”</p>
<p>This is such a monumental opportunity for my career!  It is a chance to get my work in front of a plethora of prospective collaborative partners, art publications, local galleries, and individual collectors.  Also, in addition to the potential new business this will generate, there will be SO many amazing artists there who I greatly admire.  This is the perfect opportunity for me meet and interact with some of my idols.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>For all the excitement I have for D-Con, I am also very nervous, because there are some challenges I need to overcome.  One of them is entirely on me: I need to produce more artwork.  And I am! (Stay tuned for that)</p>
<p>The largest hurdle at this point, however, is financial... and that's where you can help!  I need the funds to print new merchandise, stickers, and art prints, as well as some branding materials like business cards and banners.  My display design also needs some love.  I have allocated funds from my fundraising goal to go towards the purchase of gridwall panels, display shelves and boxes, and more, to help organize and optimize my space.</p>
<p>But that's not all.  Here is an initial breakdown of my estimated expenses for the convention:</p>
<ul>
<li>$500 - Stickers</li>
<li>$750 - 10x10 Booth fee</li>
<li>$75 - Transportation and parking</li>
<li>$300 - Display supplies (grid wall, display shelves, etc)</li>
<li>$300 - Packaging and branding (bags, plastic sleeves, logo banner, etc.)</li>
<li>$100 - Frames</li>
<li>$1500 - Merch printing</li>
<li>$750 - Art prints</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Total: $4275</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To keep this much after Indiegogo’s 5% platform fee and 5% reserved funds are set aside, I need a total of $4750.  I am rounding up to <strong>$5000</strong> to buffer for unforeseen expenses and inaccurate estimates.</p>

Sometimes he blends thoughts and make art pieces that coexist inside occult, symbolism and modern ways like an imaginary neo-shamanism of now.

<p>ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΑ </p>
<p>ΒΙΟ</p>
<p>Πειραματιστής, αυτοδίδακτος στο ευρύτερο εικαστικό και οπτικό – ακουστικό κομμάτι των τεχνών και του σύγχρονου με επιρροές από προσωπικά βιώματα, την ψυχολογία και την εννοιολογική τέχνη. Αναμιγνύει σκέψεις και μέσα από αυτές χτίζονται συνθέσεις που ακροβατούν ανάμεσα στο απόκρυφο, στις σύγχρονες έννοιες ενός φανταστικού νεο-σαμανισμού, των λέξεων και της στιγμής. Με έναν άτυπο άξονα την ανάγκη της ενδοσκόπησης, τα μέσα που χρησιμοποιεί ποικίλουν, άλλες φορές η φωτογραφία κυριαρχεί, άλλες πάλι δημιουργεί υβρίδια έκφρασης με διάφορα μέσα και υλικά, ώστε να κυριαρχεί η ελευθερία της έκφρασης μέσα στο σύνολο ολιστικά.</p>
<p>Δεν έχει σημασία το μέσο. Αλλά αυτός ο άλλος εαυτός που γεννιέται μέσα από τη φαντασία. Καθετί που δίνει τροφή στο πνεύμα.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Χαρακτηριστικά του βιβλίου:</strong></p>
<p>Aυτό είναι το πρώτο πειραματικό<strong> silent</strong><strong> poetry</strong><strong> comic</strong> book που ήρθε μετά την σύνθεση των βιωμάτων 3 ετών . Αποτελείται απο περίπου 28 σελίδες  και απο4  ενότητες. Είναι σελιδοποιημένο, στις σελίδες του εμπεριέχονται 25 έγχρωμες ψηφιακές εικονογραφήσεις  σε τέσσερις ενότητες και ένα πειραματικό ποιήμα που χωρίζεται σε 4 μέρη στο τέλος κάθε ενότητας .</p>
<p>Χρησιμοποιώ εννοιολογικά την τέχνη της τυπογραφίας, της εικονογράφησης και της βιβλιοδεσίας μιας και ανήκουν στα πιο δημοφιλή Μ.Μ.Ε ώστε να γίνει ξεκάθαρη η ¨ παράξενη ¨ δημοσιότητα που έχει αποκτήσει τα τελευταία χρόνια η έννοια της δημοκρατίας , τα έντονα χρώματα, τα μάτια και το pop ύφος ώστε να φανεί η σχέση που έχει αποκτήσει η δημοκρατία με την ποπ κουλτούρα (social media, pop καλλιτέχνες ). Το βιβλίο έχει την λογική του cut book ,δηλαδή σε όλες τις σελίδες του υπάρχει ένδειξη διακεκομένων γραμμών για ελεύθερο κόψιμο για να τονιστεί η ανάγκη για αναδόμηση  και αποδόμηση.</p>
<p><strong>Επιρροές και στοιχεία :</strong></p>
<p>Τι  είναι η δημοκρατία αλήθεια, τώρα που οι εποχές αλλάζουν και οι έννοιες αρχίζουν να μοιάζουν παλιές και εκτός τόπου και χρόνου. Μέσα απο τις σελίδες του ο δημιουργός άρχισε να νιώθει την ανάγκη να εξερευνήσει με μια ποπ αισθητική το τώρα της ζωής όπως φιλτράρεται μέσα απο την κοινωνία στην οποία το βιώνει. Λειτουργώντας κυρίως με το υποσυνέιδητο παρατηρούμε σχόλια επάνω στηνπροσωπική  ελευθερία, την ενσυναίσθηση, την μετανάστευση και την πολιτική συγκυρία των καιρών.</p>
<p><i>Έρχεται ο καιρός όπου τα ιδεολογικά συστήματα (δημοκρατια,θρησκεια,κρατη,συνορα,πολιτισμοι) φθάνουν σε μια σταθερη και πάγια κατάσταση όσο ο χρόνος περνά, τότε παίρνουν μορφή στο υποσεινήδητο όλων και γίνονται σαν φαντασιακά όνειρα που μας οδηγούν στα τυφλά .</i></p>
<p><i>Γίνονται σκιές που δεν βλέπουμε, γίνονται χέρια που μας καθοδηγούν σε σκοτεινές εποχές και η αναγκαιότητα τους πλέον είναι αναποφευκτα συνδεδεμένη με την μορφή μας και την σκέψη μας.</i></p>
<p><i>Πόσο σημαντική λοιπόν είναι η αναθεώρηση των συστημάτων αυτών όταν παίρνουν μια τέτοια μορφή, είτε πρόκειται για θρησκείες, είτε για πολιτικά, πολιτιστικά,επιστημονικά συστήματα. Πότε αυτά παύουν να εξυπηρετούν την εξέλιξη και αποκτούν καθαρά καταναγκαστικό χαρακτήρα εις βάρος όλον των ανθρώπων που επιρρεάζουν άμμεσα αλλα και έμμεσα?  </i></p>
<p><i>Όταν ένα τετοιο σύστημα (όπως η δημοκρατία) καταλήγει να έχει καταναγκαστικό χαρακτήρα και δεν εξετάζεται ή αναθεωρείται , αυτό το είδος του καταναγκασμού κάνει μεγάλο κακο στην όποια - πιθανή-  </i><i>υγειή εξέλιξη των πολιτισμών .</i></p>
<p><i>Όπως ο λόγος και η λογική έτσι και όλες αυτές οι ιδεες και έννοιες νοσούν όταν δεν κινούνται. </i></p>
<p><i>Τα ιδεολογικα συστηματα ειναι προιοντα της ανθρωπινης λογικης και του ανθρωπινουν λογου και έχουν την αναγκη να αναδομουνται και να εξελισονται αναλογικα με ότι τα δημιουργεί. </i></p>
<p><i>Η αναδόμηση και η αποδόμηση είναι διαδικασίες ανάλυσης ενός γλωσσικού, εννοιολογικού ή ιδεολογικού συστήματος. Με σκοπό να εκθέσει  </i><i>σε κοινή θέα όλες τις μη λειτουργικές ή εσωτερικές και κρυφές αντιφάσεις του, που τρέφουν και δηλητηριάζουν τον αρχικό σκοπό του, ώστε να γεννηθεί εκ νέου, εξυπηρετώντας τους σκοπούς που ορίστηκαν εξ αρχής.</i></p>
<p><strong>Τι και τι  ?</strong><br/>Η  χρηματοδότησή μου καλύπτει όλο το κόστος τυπογραφίας, τη διαφήμιση και τις δημιουργικές ανάγκες ολόκληρης της διαδικασίας, επίσης μου δίνει περισσότερο χρόνο για να ξεκινήσω το επόμενο καλλιτεχνικό έργο μου.</p>
<p>Η πρώτη έκδοση του βιβλίου θα είναι 90 αντίγραφα του βιβλίου, όλα υπογεγραμμένα . Θα λάβετε ένα αντίγραφο του βιβλίου και πολλά άλλα ανάλογα με το ποσο χρηματοδότησής σας.</p>
<p>Υπάρχουν ειδικά δώρα, όπως συλλεκτικά artprints, carpostals και μια αποκλειστική ειδική έκδοση με πλήρες πακέτο.  Μερικοί από εσάς θα μπορέσετε να κερδίσετε ειδικά δώρα που γίνονται για αυτή την εκστρατεία.</p>
<p>Αυτό είναι ένα από τα πρώτα πειραματικά ποίηματα κόμικς που έγιναν ποτέ.</p>
<p>Επίσης, στην Ελλάδα παρουσιάστηκε σto φεστιβάλ τέχνης RE CULTURE #4 , σε συλλογική έκθεση στην Πάτρα. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Για εκείνους που δεν μπορούν να συνεισφέρουν και θέλουν να υποστηρίξουν ούτως ή άλλως, μπορούν να χρησιμοποιήσουν τη δύναμη των κοινωνικών μέσων και να μοιραστούν αυτή την ιστορία μου!</p>
<p>Eυχαριστώ θερμά όλες και όλους  σας!  Κάντε τέχνη!  Μοιραστείτε τέχνη!</p>
<p>Κρατήστε την τέχνη ζωντανή! Κρατήστε την αισιοδοξία ζωντανή!</p>

ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΑ 
ΒΙΟ
Πειραματιστής, αυτοδίδακτος στο ευρύτερο εικαστικό και οπτικό – ακουστικό κομμάτι των τεχνών και του σύγχρονου με επιρροές από προσωπικά βιώματα, την ψυχολογία και την εννοιολογική τέχνη. Αναμιγνύει σκέψεις και μέσα από αυτές χτίζονται συνθέσεις που ακροβατούν ανάμεσα στο απόκρυφο, στις σύγχρονες έννοιες ενός φανταστικού νεο-σαμανισμού, των λέξεων και της στιγμής. Με έναν άτυπο άξονα την ανάγκη της ενδοσκόπησης, τα μέσα που χρησιμοποιεί ποικίλουν, άλλες φορές η φωτογραφία κυριαρχεί, άλλες πάλι δημιουργεί υβρίδια έκφρασης με διάφορα μέσα και υλικά, ώστε να κυριαρχεί η ελευθερία της έκφρασης μέσα στο σύνολο ολιστικά.
Δεν έχει σημασία το μέσο. Αλλά αυτός ο άλλος εαυτός που γεννιέται μέσα από τη φαντασία. Καθετί που δίνει τροφή στο πνεύμα.
 
Χαρακτηριστικά του βιβλίου:
Aυτό είναι το πρώτο πειραματικό silent poetry comic book που ήρθε μετά την σύνθεση των βιωμάτων 3 ετών . Αποτελείται απο περίπου 28 σελίδες  και απο4  ενότητες. Είναι σελιδοποιημένο, στις σελίδες του εμπεριέχονται 25 έγχρωμες ψηφιακές εικονογραφήσεις  σε τέσσερις ενότητες και ένα πειραματικό ποιήμα που χωρίζεται σε 4 μέρη στο τέλος κάθε ενότητας .
Χρησιμοποιώ εννοιολογικά την τέχνη της τυπογραφίας, της εικονογράφησης και της βιβλιοδεσίας μιας και ανήκουν στα πιο δημοφιλή Μ.Μ.Ε ώστε να γίνει ξεκάθαρη η ¨ παράξενη ¨ δημοσιότητα που έχει αποκτήσει τα τελευταία χρόνια η έννοια της δημοκρατίας , τα έντονα χρώματα, τα μάτια και το pop ύφος ώστε να φανεί η σχέση που έχει αποκτήσει η δημοκρατία με την ποπ κουλτούρα (social media, pop καλλιτέχνες ). Το βιβλίο έχει την λογική του cut book ,δηλαδή σε όλες τις σελίδες του υπάρχει ένδειξη διακεκομένων γραμμών για ελεύθερο κόψιμο για να τονιστεί η ανάγκη για αναδόμηση  και αποδόμηση.
Επιρροές και στοιχεία :
Τι  είναι η δημοκρατία αλήθεια, τώρα που οι εποχές αλλάζουν και οι έννοιες αρχίζουν να μοιάζουν παλιές και εκτός τόπου και χρόνου. Μέσα απο τις σελίδες του ο δημιουργός άρχισε να νιώθει την ανάγκη να εξερευνήσει με μια ποπ αισθητική το τώρα της ζωής όπως φιλτράρεται μέσα απο την κοινωνία στην οποία το βιώνει. Λειτουργώντας κυρίως με το υποσυνέιδητο παρατηρούμε σχόλια επάνω στηνπροσωπική  ελευθερία, την ενσυναίσθηση, την μετανάστευση και την πολιτική συγκυρία των καιρών.
Έρχεται ο καιρός όπου τα ιδεολογικά συστήματα (δημοκρατια,θρησκεια,κρατη,συνορα,πολιτισμοι) φθάνουν σε μια σταθερη και πάγια κατάσταση όσο ο χρόνος περνά, τότε παίρνουν μορφή στο υποσεινήδητο όλων και γίνονται σαν φαντασιακά όνειρα που μας οδηγούν στα τυφλά .
Γίνονται σκιές που δεν βλέπουμε, γίνονται χέρια που μας καθοδηγούν σε σκοτεινές εποχές και η αναγκαιότητα τους πλέον είναι αναποφευκτα συνδεδεμένη με την μορφή μας και την σκέψη μας.
Πόσο σημαντική λοιπόν είναι η αναθεώρηση των συστημάτων αυτών όταν παίρνουν μια τέτοια μορφή, είτε πρόκειται για θρησκείες, είτε για πολιτικά, πολιτιστικά,επιστημονικά συστήματα. Πότε αυτά παύουν να εξυπηρετούν την εξέλιξη και αποκτούν καθαρά καταναγκαστικό χαρακτήρα εις βάρος όλον των ανθρώπων που επιρρεάζουν άμμεσα αλλα και έμμεσα?  
Όταν ένα τετοιο σύστημα (όπως η δημοκρατία) καταλήγει να έχει καταναγκαστικό χαρακτήρα και δεν εξετάζεται ή αναθεωρείται , αυτό το είδος του καταναγκασμού κάνει μεγάλο κακο στην όποια - πιθανή-  υγειή εξέλιξη των πολιτισμών .
Όπως ο λόγος και η λογική έτσι και όλες αυτές οι ιδεες και έννοιες νοσούν όταν δεν κινούνται. 
Τα ιδεολογικα συστηματα ειναι προιοντα της ανθρωπινης λογικης και του ανθρωπινουν λογου και έχουν την αναγκη να αναδομουνται και να εξελισονται αναλογικα με ότι τα δημιουργεί. 
Η αναδόμηση και η αποδόμηση είναι διαδικασίες ανάλυσης ενός γλωσσικού, εννοιολογικού ή ιδεολογικού συστήματος. Με σκοπό να εκθέσει  σε κοινή θέα όλες τις μη λειτουργικές ή εσωτερικές και κρυφές αντιφάσεις του, που τρέφουν και δηλητηριάζουν τον αρχικό σκοπό του, ώστε να γεννηθεί εκ νέου, εξυπηρετώντας τους σκοπούς που ορίστηκαν εξ αρχής.
Τι και τι  ?Η  χρηματοδότησή μου καλύπτει όλο το κόστος τυπογραφίας, τη διαφήμιση και τις δημιουργικές ανάγκες ολόκληρης της διαδικασίας, επίσης μου δίνει περισσότερο χρόνο για να ξεκινήσω το επόμενο καλλιτεχνικό έργο μου.
Η πρώτη έκδοση του βιβλίου θα είναι 90 αντίγραφα του βιβλίου, όλα υπογεγραμμένα . Θα λάβετε ένα αντίγραφο του βιβλίου και πολλά άλλα ανάλογα με το ποσο χρηματοδότησής σας.
Υπάρχουν ειδικά δώρα, όπως συλλεκτικά artprints, carpostals και μια αποκλειστική ειδική έκδοση με πλήρες πακέτο.  Μερικοί από εσάς θα μπορέσετε να κερδίσετε ειδικά δώρα που γίνονται για αυτή την εκστρατεία.
Αυτό είναι ένα από τα πρώτα πειραματικά ποίηματα κόμικς που έγιναν ποτέ.
Επίσης, στην Ελλάδα παρουσιάστηκε σto φεστιβάλ τέχνης RE CULTURE #4 , σε συλλογική έκθεση στην Πάτρα. 
 
Για εκείνους που δεν μπορούν να συνεισφέρουν και θέλουν να υποστηρίξουν ούτως ή άλλως, μπορούν να χρησιμοποιήσουν τη δύναμη των κοινωνικών μέσων και να μοιραστούν αυτή την ιστορία μου!
Eυχαριστώ θερμά όλες και όλους  σας!  Κάντε τέχνη!  Μοιραστείτε τέχνη!
Κρατήστε την τέχνη ζωντανή! Κρατήστε την αισιοδοξία ζωντανή!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">WELCOME.</span></h3>
<p>Hi Earthlings and beyond! I am Lexc Bowling, an Interior Designer working to receive my Masters in Architecture, currently residing in Lexington, Kentucky. I have a passion for art, people, places, things, and our future. Most of my work and dedicated research revolves around creating a socially sustainable world with high focus on our existence amongst ourselves, the natural world, and this emergence with the digital world. As I implement these practices into all of my design work, I have been hard at work developing an art installation that encompasses all of this... step inside <strong>react.</strong></p>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">THE VISION.</span></h3>
<p><strong>PROJECT SUMMARY: </strong>react<i>.</i> pods are experimental environments whereby users enter a portal to radical self-expression. Powered by the user’s physical and emotional energy the participant is immersed in vibrant hues and is encouraged to explore authentic movement as expression and expression as art. </p>
<p><strong>INTERACTIVITY: </strong>react. exists by embracing 5 key elements: light, color, sound, media, and movement. The interaction between individual and installation helps explore and illustrate the alchemy of the user’s physical and emotional energy. Inside, the participant will augment their environment by selecting vibrant hues that mimic the mood they feel in the moment. Influenced by curated sounds, the door to explorative movement is opened. The visuals projected onto the focus wall will morph with the changing rhythms of bodies and sound melting into a kaleidoscope of expression. In react., one can move, meditate, create, and explore the landscapes of their mind. Disappear in dance and liberate the senses, flowing in and out of the beat as body and mind transcends. react. embodies what it is to burn by creating space for an individual to freely express and explore their truest self. This portal will transport and translate a genuinely interactive playa experience to virtually anyone, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p><strong>PHILOSOPHY: </strong>The magic of movement is brewed in all its unexplainable, impossible, and synchronistic experiences. Of these moments that I’ve been fortunate enough to engage in, my backwards stumble into an ecstatic dance circle prevails. We exist in a time of fast pace and instant messages. Natural and truly therapeutic processes occur all around us, yet we are distracted. It is as if we have therapy constantly at our fingertips, but have lost touch with how to harness it. Our bodies have devolved into a shape for holding devices and our eyes are fixed on the screen. We are numb to curiosity, our attention is divided, and connection to the world in which we float has been disturbed. react. seeks to revive ancient therapeutic practices of light, color, sound, and movement, and seed them with technology so they may flourish in the now. react. will reshape our bodies and lift the stigma drowning out our existence in the digital-age to provide an individualized yet integrated space for healing.</p>
<p><strong>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION:</strong> Inspired by kaleidoscopic elements, each react. pod is designed as a 6-sided polygon with a ceiling and floor defining sacred space for individual participant experience. The frame is constructed of modular steel framing. The focus wall is a blank wooden panel situated adjacent to a short-throw projector.

</div></div>","WELCOME.
Hi Earthlings and beyond! I am Lexc Bowling, an Interior Designer working to receive my Masters in Architecture, currently residing in Lexington, Kentucky. I have a passion for art, people, places, things, and our future. Most of my work and dedicated research revolves around creating a socially sustainable world with high focus on our existence amongst ourselves, the natural world, and this emergence with the digital world. As I implement these practices into all of my design work, I have been hard at work developing an art installation that encompasses all of this... step inside react.
THE VISION.
PROJECT SUMMARY: react. pods are experimental environments whereby users enter a portal to radical self-expression. Powered by the user’s physical and emotional energy the participant is immersed in vibrant hues and is encouraged to explore authentic movement as expression and expression as art. 
INTERACTIVITY: react. exists by embracing 5 key elements: light, color, sound, media, and movement. The interaction between individual and installation helps explore and illustrate the alchemy of the user’s physical and emotional energy. Inside, the participant will augment their environment by selecting vibrant hues that mimic the mood they feel in the moment. Influenced by curated sounds, the door to explorative movement is opened. The visuals projected onto the focus wall will morph with the changing rhythms of bodies and sound melting into a kaleidoscope of expression. In react., one can move, meditate, create, and explore the landscapes of their mind. Disappear in dance and liberate the senses, flowing in and out of the beat as body and mind transcends. react. embodies what it is to burn by creating space for an individual to freely express and explore their truest self. This portal will transport and translate a genuinely interactive playa experience to virtually anyone, anywhere in the world.
PHILOSOPHY: The magic of movement is brewed in all its unexplainable, impossible, and synchronistic experiences. Of these moments that I’ve been fortunate enough to engage in, my backwards stumble into an ecstatic dance circle prevails. We exist in a time of fast pace and instant messages. Natural and truly therapeutic processes occur all around us, yet we are distracted. It is as if we have therapy constantly at our fingertips, but have lost touch with how to harness it. Our bodies have devolved into a shape for holding devices and our eyes are fixed on the screen. We are numb to curiosity, our attention is divided, and connection to the world in which we float has been disturbed. react. seeks to revive ancient therapeutic practices of light, color, sound, and movement, and seed them with technology so they may flourish in the now. react. will reshape our bodies and lift the stigma drowning out our existence in the digital-age to provide an individualized yet integrated space for healing.
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: Inspired by kaleidoscopic elements, each react. pod is designed as a 6-sided polygon with a ceiling and floor defining sacred space for individual participant experience. The frame is constructed of modular steel framing. The focus wall is a blank wooden panel situated adjacent to a short-throw projector. Surrounding walls encase panels of LED light arrangements varying in color, adjusted by each individual. Approaching the nest of pods, illuminated exteriors invite curious onlookers to explore the space and their own inner selves. Birthed by the union of LED light and motion-capturing media, the interior environment morphs into a vibrant haven where every movement mimics a brushstroke, creating a visual reflection of the participant's energy.

THE OBSTACLES.
As a student, with all of that economic gloom, I am face-to-face with funding challenges. BUT, when money is the only problem, is it really a problem? I believe with manifestation, devotion, and passion, this vision will find a way to come to life... starting here, in this campaign. I am seeking to grow this project with merely my own hands. The more I can grow support and awareness, the further this vision travels. Ideally, transportation will support the journey home and evolve2 will radiate with inspiration from said travel, while bringing art back to Kentucky. 
My passion and drive helps me when facing the obstacles. I will not give up and work to produce this vision into something impactful and special to each individual that interacts with it. With this, we gain power!

YOUR SUPPORT WILL GIVE LIFE TO REACT.
The total budget per react. pod is around $4,800. 
Most of the budget here goes towards the flexible aluminum framing. This aspect of the piece is elegant in design, durable, and truly honors the 'pop up' experience react. offers. The idea is that react. will morph into many different interactive environments throughout its lifespan. Within the boundaries of the framing, unlimited possibilities await. By loading this environment with tools for creativity, pod construct will offer space for creatives of all kind and thrive on collaboration through its many forms. 
react. is in the running for partial grants of all sorts at events and festivals around the country. While we eagerly wait for responses, it is crucial to begin bringing this project to life. To build react. we depend on FUNDRAISING EFFORTS AND DONATIONS OF GENEROUS SUPPORTERS AND COMMUNITY.
Funds raised will go to all aspects of the project.  From materials to transportation, each donation will help in the process of bringing react. to a space near you!
It is with full intention that react. explore our local community and provide a haven for expression outside of its typical environment. This ritualistic environment hopes to touch familiars and strangers alike, unifying us all on a path to deeper self discovery!
DONATE TODAY!
Donations of $4 or more will receive a react. sticker.
Donations of $50 or more will receive their choice of:
*a pair of react. symbol earrings (wooden or acrylic)
or 
*a react. symbol necklace. (wooden or acrylic)

Your help means the world to this vision. Every dollar counts and goes toward this campaign. Other ways to get involved include:
*MAKING SOME NOISE about the vision. Share it via social media with friends, family, and strangers.. Help to spread the word!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a writer, painter, and educator living in Grand Rapids, MI. For a little while now, I've been working on a series of paintings that highlight the uniqueness and beauty of birds that we often take for granted: sparrows, robins, bluebirds, seagulls, etc. Since I don't have a lot of connections in the art scene locally, I want to produce some prints to get my work out there and use the sale of the prints as a jumping off point for more paintings. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The company with whom I'm contracting has quoted me the following prices:</p>
<ul>
<li>$45 per image to scan, edit, and color correct. Once they have the images, the pictures can be printed on demand. This is the biggest expense. I would like to have six of my paintings on file, at least initially. This is a total of $270, plus taxes.</li>
<li>$7.50 per print. I would like to produce 10 prints of each image to have on hand for stock and sale. This is a total of $375.</li>
<li>The additional money (~$350) will go to producing the ""rewards"" for backers and purchasing materials for more paintings. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I don't anticipate any particular challenges or risks in this project. The prices quoted will remain constant, and as long as I reach at least the $600 level, I will have enough stock on hand to, hopefully, continue the funding process on my own.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please share this campaign on social media! I'm just starting out on my art career, and I'm not even sure many of my friends know what I've been up to. </p>

<h3>Short Summary </h3>
<p>Hi! I’m Phoenix Carpenter, 2019 Skills USA Welding Sculpture National  Runner-up, and Founder and creator of Phoenix Metal Art. Born and raised in the hills West Virginia, I operate out of my home studio to spread my art work to these hills and hopefully the world. Any contributions will go towards supplies and well needed equipment for here in the shop. I am still in need of various machines such as; a Plasma Cutter, horizontal band saw, oxy-fuel tanks and torches, a tig welder, and many more necessary items that will expand my art capabilities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Metal is considered to be one of the most difficult mediums to work with, to make the process easier and more efficient, I am looking to expand my home studio with various equipment and machines. Such as a Plasma cutter and consumables, a multi-process High frequency TIG welder, and horizontal band saw. I am looking for a goal of $1000, with that I will be able to produce more and higher quality art, and distribute to more customers. Even if my goal is not reached any and all contributions will be greatly appreciated and will go towards one thing or another to expand my shop. <br/> </p>
<p>There will be different levels of contributions with various levels of perks or rewards. Everything from Eternal Gratitude, signed original prints, raffles for higher end art,  discounts and credit towards custom orders, and even your own piece of unique art from Phoenix Metal Art!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of this fundraiser will greatly improve my welding and art limits, and I will get more of my art around the world! In making all of this “Scrap Metal Art” I am recycling junk and metal materials, that most people would think is trash, in my own unique way that takes ugly junk that would otherwise take up space in landfills. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Welding and metal sculpting can be rather dangerous with possibility of electrocution, fires,  burns, eye damage, lung damage, cuts, and even several cancers. By making things more efficient and quicker, thats less time working with these conditions that are inevitable.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that times are difficult right now during this Covid-19 pandemic, if you are unable to contribute towards this cause, please share this link and make some noise for an inspiring local artist. </p>

The colors delight us with their luminous hues. Taste the sweetness of the early morning air... and have this wonderous view all to yourself.""Dawn"" is certain to brighten your day.  Winter | Pieter Bruegel | Giclée Fine Art Print A winter’s day...silence, icy mountains, frozen lakes. Time standing still.An inspired work of a master Artist, the exceptional print quality of ""Winter"" astounds with all the hidden details of Bruegel’s vision. Closed | Edward Hopper | Giclée Fine Art Print Painting as Film Noir.A downtown diner late at night…  We stare uninvited through the large plate glass window. We pause and reflect on the emptiness of modern life. Dense shadows of the dark and deserted urban streetscape surround us.Cue: muted saxophone and footsteps receding out of sight in the distance, the film set is ""Closed"" now.  Monday Morning | Georges Seurat | Giclée Fine Art Print For Parisians, Sunday is the day to escape the heat of the city and head for the shade of the trees. What you often find are hordes of your fellow citizens with the exact same plan!Peace. Solitude. Nature. Sunday crowds, or the quiet of ""Monday Morning"".Which do you prefer? Hahnemühle German Etching Paper | Giclée Fine Art Print Our Giclée Fine Art Prints are simply the finest prints available.

One day she glimpsed in her cursed mirror the reflected image of the fair knight Lancelot and chanced to gaze at him directly. The mirror cracked and a spell fell upon her. She drifted in her boat downstream ‘singing her last song’ and died before she reached Camelot and her love.""The Boat"" is indeed a beautiful and haunting work of Art. The Sea of Fog | Caspar Friedrich | Giclée Fine Art Print A rocky precipice boldly rises above a landscape covered in a thick sea of fog. Considered one of the founders of Classical Romanticism, Friedrich said : ""The artist should paint not only what he has in front of him but also what he sees inside himself.”Experiencing ""The Sea of Fog"", should we not feel the same? The Long Table | Leonardo da Vinci | Giclée Fine Art Print Leonardo painted this masterpiece on the wall of the dining room in the refectory of the Dominican convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie.Done in tempera and oil on gypsum, instead of the standard fresco technique commonly used in this era, the painting moves us with its magnificence.A superior Giclee Fine Art Print, as close to the original as possible... which begs the question: exactly what happened at ""The Long Table""?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey all! Many of you that know me have either received a few free art pieces from me in the past, or know that painting and drawing have been passions of mine for some time. I've never taken the leap to actually sell any of my pieces, as I've struggled with some insecurities in the past about my talents. I figured a self-taught artist could never be good enough to gain any notice, let alone to make a profit off of her own work! That changes today. I've created something I've found so inspiring that I want to share her with the world. In fact, I've felt so inspired lately that I'm finally ready to take the leap and believe in my ability to create and to sell what I make.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need your help! I've run out of most of my art supplies - paints, papers, markers, sketch books, etc. and am in serious need of replenishing my stock before I can move ahead with a few of the other pieces I've been itching to create. Your support will go directly towards purchasing supplies for future pieces, or towards pre-ordering a copy of my latest painting, 'Maiden Magna Mater'.</p>
<p>Perks include anything from a personal shout-out to a framed copy of the original painting.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There's no real goal here as far as funds raised! I'll keep the campaign going for the next 60 days and post updates about the supplies I've been able to purchase with your support, as well as progress photos of 'Maiden Magna Mater'. All pre-orders will be shipped at the campaign's conclusion, as I will be out of state studying holism for 30 days out of the campaign.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you believe in my work, feel free to share this campaign on your social media! The more traffic, the better chance I'll have to receive enough support to purchase all of the supplies I need to keep me going throughout the rest of 2019. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>My name is Gabriel Castillo. I am an Actor, Writer and New York City Taxi Driver. For many years I was ashamed to ever say I was a  Taxi Driver. But I have learned that the things we do to survive and put food on the table and give beautiful things to our loved ones are meant to be appreciated.</p>
<p>So Yes. I am a New York City Taxi Driver. And that is why I have a story to tell because of the cabs. Sometimes in life, things choose us. Because what you ask the Universe will always manifest.</p>
<p>This One man show examines a Cab Driver that is stranded and by some Miracle he has an audience that will just let him spill the beans and redeem his spirit. People that want to hear his side of the story and why the Cabbies felt that they had to end it.</p>
<p>A Comedic/Dramatic Piece. That moves like a Taxi Ride. And will have you appreciating the next Ride you take.</p>
<p>I am launching this campaign because I have completed the writing of the script. And the next step is to start securing resources, so that I can begin with a reading.</p>
<p><u>* Locate and Commit to a performance venue. Off- Broadway Venue</u></p>
<p><u>* Organize and Implement the Promotion and Marketing Materials. Play Bill and Website.</u></p>
<p><u>Online marketing on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter to really reach our audience</u>.</p>
<p>My Contributors would help me Achieve the realization of launching Our show. Which is a show about the movement in transportation, how the Yellow Cabs have and are slowly becoming extinct.</p>
<p>You supporters would help the 135k Drivers have a voice. That was taken away from us. And I could spread the message of Unity to the People. Because if every Driver was united and stopped driving for as long as it takes until our voice was heard. For Christ sakes we are the ones driving the car!</p>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>We are trying to reach our Goal of 30k Which should cover our expenses for a 3 Week performance of the show. </li>
<li>Venue will be  Ars Nova on 12th Avenue will be $ 800.00 Per Night Equaling to 9600.00 This would give us a 99 seat venue with 2 Technicians. This would include the expenses of Comp Tickets for Producers and also Family Members  and also Sponsoring Personnel. Along with Industry.</li>
<li>Director will cost $250.00 a Day for the Direction of the production. $ 3000.00</li>
<li>Makeup Artist will cost $150.00 A night for $ 1800.00 for Duration of the show.</li>
<li>Rehearsal Rental would be $ 50.00 an Hour or $1050 for 21hrs or Equivalent of 3 Weeks rehearsal space.</li>
<li>Speech coach will be 150.00 an Hour for 12hours totaling $1800.00 Due to the duration of the Play. </li>
<li>Stage Manager $150.00 Per Show.</li>
<li>Production Management Support. $2000.00 Consultation to oversee the The Creation and Maintenance of the Production of Yo Taxi.</li>
<li>Artist Expense Projections. Will be on a Equity Showcase Contract. But will be living on the minimum. The cause is greater than the sandwich.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Yo Taxi Perks are out of this world!</p>
<ul>
<li>Autographed Taxi Receipt Paper from The Original Garage where Idea was born.</li>
<li>Autographed Police Tickets. Official Tickets That have caused me hundreds of dollars will be a perk to go to a cause. </li>
<li>Original Storyboard Art Work by Prolific Artist and Brother Robert Castillo (He has no choice)</li>

<li>$5.00 Perks get you Original Dispatcher Receipts. </li>
<li>Bigger Donations will feature Producer and Opening Night Tickets and Seating.</li>
<li>VIP Packages will include Portraits and Night out with Artist where I will be an As Directed driver for the Night in a NYC Yellow Cab (Minivan or Camry can be requested)</li>
<li>The Funds will go into the production if we don't reach our goal. There is a sane.</li>
<li>The show must go on.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>The Impact we will have is that we will have shared our message with all of New York City. The Cab Drivers are being mistreated. The FHV Drivers are being taken advantage of. At the end of the day we have to all examine ourselves. And that is what this play does.</p>
<p>We are Human beings and we can change things. We cannot allow corporations to make slaves out of Human Beings and be okay with that. This industry has been plagued for so many years, fighting with City Hall for many years with Police Tickets and Speed Limits.</p>
<p>To now being fined for not wearing a seatbelt. Most Cabbies develop Bladder Problems on the job. It is a very acceptable form of cruelty. The City has to respect people's lives just as the respect everyone's Religion and Sex and everything.</p>
<p>They have to respect our lives on the streets. We have served New York for over One Hundred Plus Years in our history of Cab Drivers. And throughout that span. There has never been a Play or recognition for these Drivers. But I feel that in my heart. That the abuse on the road is a form of Bullying and Its about time we confront this growing Problem. And that's why I developed this show.</p>
<p>The day I received Three Tickets last year is where the Idea was planted. I have to tell who ever will listen. These drivers are being Bullied by the System. And I am a Driver. But I am a person first. And my voice will be heard. And New York is the show me State. So I will show everyone what really went on before the Suicides took place. Because I was there. And my loved ones know what damage has been done because of this job. I have lost so many things in life. But I want to bring closure to all the families that are in that place with questions. I want them to heal. And I offer my craft to help them and help myself move on. Because everyone deserves to know the truth. And we have to be an example for the young kids of today. And Bullying in any for has to stop.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is A one of a kind Show that will be just that A Taxi Ride. Except this one is headed somewhere Special. Somewhere where we discover humanity all over again.</li>
<li>I am a New Yorker Born in the Bronx. I have been pursuing my career with my up's and downs and I have been successful and I have failed. But when your heart is into a project. It's like your super sensitive and emotional. And It's something I haven't felt in a very long time. It's almost like seeing your child for the very first time I hear. And I know I can't do it alone. It takes a village to raise a child. And everybody receiving this link. It's because it was supposed to reach you. I am gonna send this to anyone and everyone. Because I always tell my Cabbie friends don't worry One day we are gonna get our day. Even if it's My Day. They will also be there. So it will be Our Day. I always joke with them and say this is Guantanomo on wheels.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>The Risk that we have is that we will like every other show go through hurdles. We will have our challenges like everyone else. We will change our minds on certain aspects of the show and what direction the show wants to go and what direction we want the show to go in. But in the end we will go with the truth of the show. And that is what I believe everyone tries to achieve. To have the production keep it's raw truth but to polish the kinks of the show and what works to what doesn't. I hope that doesn't sound to complicated. </p>
<ul>
<li>The Qualities I bring is the persistence of never giving up and an undying quench for perfection and in constant search of the truth. To be transparent and let the audience into that place. It's what every artist strives for. To keep it genuine. But also to surround myself around with a great team. My success is everyone's success. It's a team effort. So I'm not one to just take all the credit. And my completing this script was support from the people God puts in your life. And the finishing of the script is a testament of never giving up. I let it marinate. That's what I've heard other artist say. The truth is I had to pay my bills. And the Cabs just stopped providing even that basic necessity. So I was in between a rock and a hard place. That's my favorite sain. Besides the line in Crimson Tide. A joke that only my brother gets. </li>
<li>My plan to solve every and any problem would be to look at and dissect the problem. To try and seek advice and also talk with people who have expertise in the issue. You can't think you alone is gonna solve all the problems. That's a recipe for disaster. Me and my team will solve the problems with the support of my contributors. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>For those of you that can't donate. Don't worry. Just spread the news and the link. I am grateful you're even looking at this. Just let other people know about this movement. I feel that over the last couple of years we have stumbled upon progress. And this is something in my heart that I have to get out.</li>
<li>Just copy and paste my link. To any and everybody. The whole thing is we all know someone who is a Driver and makes their living from Driving Taxi's whether it's Yellow or Green or Black or the App Vehicle's. We are all being used and abused. I represent everybody with this production. So think about them also.</li>

Original Storyboard Art Work by Prolific Artist and Brother Robert Castillo (He has no choice)
Rides in the City from Manhattan to Brooklyn, Hell even a JFK or Laguardia from Artist. A Great Taxi Driver is a Humble Taxi Driver.
$5.00 Perks get you Original Dispatcher Receipts. 
Bigger Donations will feature Producer and Opening Night Tickets and Seating.
VIP Packages will include Portraits and Night out with Artist where I will be an As Directed driver for the Night in a NYC Yellow Cab (Minivan or Camry can be requested)
The Funds will go into the production if we don't reach our goal. There is a sane.
The show must go on.


The Impact we will have is that we will have shared our message with all of New York City. The Cab Drivers are being mistreated. The FHV Drivers are being taken advantage of. At the end of the day we have to all examine ourselves. And that is what this play does.
We are Human beings and we can change things. We cannot allow corporations to make slaves out of Human Beings and be okay with that. This industry has been plagued for so many years, fighting with City Hall for many years with Police Tickets and Speed Limits.
To now being fined for not wearing a seatbelt. Most Cabbies develop Bladder Problems on the job. It is a very acceptable form of cruelty. The City has to respect people's lives just as the respect everyone's Religion and Sex and everything.
They have to respect our lives on the streets. We have served New York for over One Hundred Plus Years in our history of Cab Drivers. And throughout that span. There has never been a Play or recognition for these Drivers. But I feel that in my heart. That the abuse on the road is a form of Bullying and Its about time we confront this growing Problem. And that's why I developed this show.
The day I received Three Tickets last year is where the Idea was planted. I have to tell who ever will listen. These drivers are being Bullied by the System. And I am a Driver. But I am a person first. And my voice will be heard. And New York is the show me State. So I will show everyone what really went on before the Suicides took place. Because I was there. And my loved ones know what damage has been done because of this job. I have lost so many things in life. But I want to bring closure to all the families that are in that place with questions. I want them to heal. And I offer my craft to help them and help myself move on. Because everyone deserves to know the truth. And we have to be an example for the young kids of today. And Bullying in any for has to stop.

This is A one of a kind Show that will be just that A Taxi Ride. Except this one is headed somewhere Special. Somewhere where we discover humanity all over again.
I am a New Yorker Born in the Bronx. I have been pursuing my career with my up's and downs and I have been successful and I have failed. But when your heart is into a project. It's like your super sensitive and emotional. And It's something I haven't felt in a very long time. It's almost like seeing your child for the very first time I hear. And I know I can't do it alone. It takes a village to raise a child. And everybody receiving this link. It's because it was supposed to reach you. I am gonna send this to anyone and everyone. Because I always tell my Cabbie friends don't worry One day we are gonna get our day. Even if it's My Day. They will also be there. So it will be Our Day. I always joke with them and say this is Guantanomo on wheels.


The Risk that we have is that we will like every other show go through hurdles. We will have our challenges like everyone else. We will change our minds on certain aspects of the show and what direction the show wants to go and what direction we want the show to go in. But in the end we will go with the truth of the show. And that is what I believe everyone tries to achieve. To have the production keep it's raw truth but to polish the kinks of the show and what works to what doesn't. I hope that doesn't sound to complicated. 

The Qualities I bring is the persistence of never giving up and an undying quench for perfection and in constant search of the truth. To be transparent and let the audience into that place. It's what every artist strives for. To keep it genuine. But also to surround myself around with a great team. My success is everyone's success. It's a team effort. So I'm not one to just take all the credit. And my completing this script was support from the people God puts in your life. And the finishing of the script is a testament of never giving up. I let it marinate. That's what I've heard other artist say. The truth is I had to pay my bills. And the Cabs just stopped providing even that basic necessity. So I was in between a rock and a hard place. That's my favorite sain. Besides the line in Crimson Tide. A joke that only my brother gets. 
My plan to solve every and any problem would be to look at and dissect the problem. To try and seek advice and also talk with people who have expertise in the issue. You can't think you alone is gonna solve all the problems. That's a recipe for disaster. Me and my team will solve the problems with the support of my contributors. 


Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

For those of you that can't donate. Don't worry. Just spread the news and the link. I am grateful you're even looking at this. Just let other people know about this movement. I feel that over the last couple of years we have stumbled upon progress. And this is something in my heart that I have to get out.
Just copy and paste my link. To any and everybody. The whole thing is we all know someone who is a Driver and makes their living from Driving Taxi's whether it's Yellow or Green or Black or the App Vehicle's. We are all being used and abused. I represent everybody with this production. So think about them also.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

D - Preparation of the equipment and raw materials and starting the weaving process, considering that weaving a single carpet takes couple of days based on the size of the carpets and the symbols it carries.
C - Delivery of the carpet on the specified date.

Notes: 
1 - With regards to colors, symbols, geometric shapes, or the so-called patterns of the carpets, there are mainly 4 colors; meanwhile, the symbols and geometric shapes are adequately available, and we will do our best to provide more colors and patterns.
2 - As for the delivery, the price will be according to the weight and size of the carpet, and the packing will be insured and of high quality.
Risks
There are no risks except the date of delivery, which may incur slight delays, however we will do our best to provide the delivery on time.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

Chizzle teaches beginners the foundational skills needed to get started, and guides more advanced artists through the subtle techniques of sculpting masterpieces.Download templates and models or share your creations as 3D files. Recreate other people’s work and send them yours to be remixed. It’s been a while since we were all able to see and admire the works and masterpieces of history’s finest artists, but we haven’t really leveraged technology to recreate many of those skills.Chizzle is revolutionizing the way art is taught and created, enabling anyone to become a part-time apprentice to history’s sculpting maestros. But that’s only the beginning.The science behind ""fake it till you make it"" is solid and long-ago proven. We're taking it one step further: make it till you make it.  Experiments have shown that ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING is the best way to learn HOW TO DO IT. In other words, trying to surf once will teach you more about surfing than reading a dozen books about it.  The Chizzle Surface and the Studio have been designed to do just that- walk you through sculpting. It'll show you EXACTLY what to do to create specific sculptures, and in REAL-TIME.   The Standard Modelling Tool SetEvery Chizzle perk comes with our set of 3 double-ended sculpting tools, amounting to 6 super-useful modelling tips. We like them because they're durable, just the right amount of flexibility, fun to grip and stronger than wood.     The Advanced Modelling Tool SetThe advanced set is an additional 3 tools consisting of 6 ceramic modelling tips. We use them for all sorts of ceramic maneuvers. Includes the 3 found in the Basic set above, plus 3 more tools shaped for more advanced sculpting. All 6 double-ended tools are made from flexible high quality polypropylene.  Alexey is CEO of Chizzle and is responsible for everything related to business growth and strategy and oversees the production work by the design and engineering teams. While this is far from an easy task, his vast experience in industrial design and mechanical engineering and manufacturing is how he makes his 16 hour days look like a walk in the park.  Donara is in charge of logistics and financial development. She is an experienced strategic planner, and excels at organic business growth. Donara’s vast  knowledge as an industrial designer has given her a lot of insight into managing a product 's development from the very beginning to a fully realized product. Donara also manages relations with international suppliers and factories.  Like Alexey, she too is a graduate of Industrial Design (B. Design). Alex Lurye is a high tech professional with over 16 years of experiencein software development and is an expert in software architecture. In the last 8 years he served as CTO in a software warehouse company, leading development projects and building software architecture.
