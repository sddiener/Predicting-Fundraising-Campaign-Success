<h3>PROVE THEM WRONG!</h3>
<p>Growing up in Jerusalem was always a challenge for musicians, especially when it comes to rap music. Having no Record Labels has always made it hard for musicians coming out from Jerusalem to be heard. No musician had made it out from Jerusalem yet, due to the lack of concern in the music field by the stake holders (Music Institutions, schools, Media, etc...).<br/><br/>I was referred to different entities and organizations but i was turned down because none of them believed in my cause; non of them believed that we can make a difference.<br/>Our society always claims that music will lead to nowhere. This is why people should get a job with a regular wage so that they can have an average life. So all dreams can be buried and forgotten. Wait! We should PROVE THEM WRONG! I believe that my music will get heard and one day will make it out to the whole world.<br/><br/>I recorded my first Album! -Adrenalin-. All seven songs are in Arabic and talking about different aspects of my journey; God, humanity, life, love, challenges, old memories and Jerusalem.<br/><br/>In this Album I allowed myself to talk about things that people are afraid to face in public; questioning traditions and customs that we are used to without having full knowledge of why we do them and what they lead us to. Along with mixing rap with eastern and western tunes; Blues, Rock, Arabic music, folk, Jazz and more, different instruments like Guitar, Kanoon, Drums, Saz, Duduk Wind woods, O'od, Darbouka, Keyboard and sound effects were used. All of this leads to allowing my community and anyone who hears the music to get introduced to a new style. My aim behind the lyrics and style is to take people's thinking and minds to a level where they haven't reach before; a level where they can think out of the box and expand. As a result this will lead to a more open minded and better future.</p>

<p>Burns began playing and singing in 1960 while attending Miami University (Ohio) where he saw his first musical influence, Pete Seeger.  He lived for a semester (1962) in New York’s East Village, and encountered Bob Dylan at Gerde’s Folk City and the Bitter End. Playing on Bourbon Street in New Orleans for tips, he landed a real job playing and singing in a bar, at a dollar an hour.  Burns moved on to San Francisco, where he played the North Beach basket houses and on the street. From there, he went to St. Croix, where he helped to build an alternative school in the jungle, and worked with renowned trimaran designer, Dick Newick, to build the 46-ft trimaran, <i>Three Cheers,</i> for the 1972 OSTAR race. He returned to the San Francisco Bay area in 1973, where he met and played for most of that decade with folk icon, Rolf Cahn.  In 1980, he moved to Austin to be part of the exploding musical scene there.  </p>
<p>Moving from Austin to the Texas Riviera in 2007, Burns was active with the Rialto Theater in Aransas Pass as board member and talent buyer, presenting a series of musicians, many of whom are respected and revered throughout Texas (Kinky Friedman, Steven Fromholz,  Greezy Wheels,  Tish Hinojosa, Sara Hickman, Steve James)  He Hosted Woeful Wednesdays ~ formerly Blue <span tabindex=""0"">Monday</span> ~ a plugged-in blues Jam at the Tarpon Ice House in Port Aransas, and also hosted Folk Fridays. </p>
<p>Burns presents a mixture of musical styles all his own, including old folk songs, blues, Texas Country, and a sizable helping of original, acoustic material. His 1967 Martin D-28 is an extension of his body; his unique, fluid style of playing intrigues many musicians- with a soft syncopation that enhances the lead rifts.</p>
<p>Among his songs of Americana and Texana are “Erika,” about the decline of the shrimp industry; “Darlene”, the shrimp queen; ""Lucca"", a German Shephard/Belgian Malinois United States Marine; and ""Look Out New Orleans"", a blues tune that'll make you want to weep. His discography includes “Borrowed Time”, ""Island Off the Coast of Hell"", and soon to be released, ""Stuart Burns: Live at the Cactus"".</p>
<p>You can find him playing and singing around Austin, or traveling the US and UK, performing at house concerts and listening rooms. For more information or to book Stuart, contact:</p>

<p>From Stuart, ""After writing songs and performing across the US and the UK for over 50 years, the production of this CD and recording it live CD at the Cactus Cafe, is a dream come true. This is a room where the paint still recalls voices of the musicians who have come and gone. To perform in this venue to a group of friends is what I do best- and now, to get it on a recording, is exciting.""</p>
<p>To make this happen, we need $3,500. All of this will go to the cost of recording, production, marketing, and advertising. All funds collected will go towards this project- even if we don't reach our goal. In exchange for your contribution, we offer the following perks:</p>
<p>For a $10 contribution, you get a signed poster of the event.</p>
<p>For $25, you get a Stuart Burns Live at the Cactus CD.</p>
<p>For $40, you get 2 CDs: a Stuart Burns Live at the Cactus CD, and Borrowed Time.</p>
<p>For $50, you get 3 CDs: a Stuart Burns Live at the Cactus CD, Borrowed Time, and Island Off the Coast of Hell.</p>
<p>For $500 or more, you get a house concert with Stuart Burns.</p>
<p>The CDs and posters will be mailed to you.</p>

His discography includes “Borrowed Time”, ""Island Off the Coast of Hell"", and soon to be released, ""Stuart Burns: Live at the Cactus"".
You can find him playing and singing around Austin, or traveling the US and UK, performing at house concerts and listening rooms. For more information or to book Stuart, contact:
Tin Cup Management
(512) 738-2318
From Stuart, ""After writing songs and performing across the US and the UK for over 50 years, the production of this CD and recording it live CD at the Cactus Cafe, is a dream come true. This is a room where the paint still recalls voices of the musicians who have come and gone. To perform in this venue to a group of friends is what I do best- and now, to get it on a recording, is exciting.""
To make this happen, we need $3,500. All of this will go to the cost of recording, production, marketing, and advertising. All funds collected will go towards this project- even if we don't reach our goal. In exchange for your contribution, we offer the following perks:
For a $10 contribution, you get a signed poster of the event.
For $25, you get a Stuart Burns Live at the Cactus CD.
For $40, you get 2 CDs: a Stuart Burns Live at the Cactus CD, and Borrowed Time.
For $50, you get 3 CDs: a Stuart Burns Live at the Cactus CD, Borrowed Time, and Island Off the Coast of Hell.
For $500 or more, you get a house concert with Stuart Burns.
The CDs and posters will be mailed to you.
If you can't make a contribution, that's okay. check out my music at www.stuartmichaelburns.com or https://www.reverbnation.com/stuartmichaelburns or https://www.facebook.com/Stuart-Michael-Burns. 
The recording at the Cactus Cafe is January 19, 2017 at 8:00 PM. If you are in Austin, please come.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am collaborating with <a href=""http://cbttf.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CBTTF Records</a> to create a fresh new, surround-sound album of my original works, expected to be released in June 2017. The largest piece we want to include on this album is ""Of Roses and Lilies,"" a seven-minute work featuring Soprano solo voice, women's choir, and small orchestra. It is a stirring, melodic, dramatic work, taken from the Song of Solomon. Listen to the live performance debut of it in the video above, and read more about the work's story, including the Lyrics, <a href=""http://programnotes.wikia.com/wiki/Of_Roses_and_Lilies?cb=9742"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here!</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need a total of $4250 -- this will go directly to paying the musicians of our orchestra (minus fundraising fees). For supporting our professional musicians, you'll get your name AND photo of your choice listed in the album notes, as well as a copy of the finished album. Larger funding rewards include Sarah's current discography, a signed score of ""Of Roses and Lilies,"" a one-hour Skype chat with Sarah, and more!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We will be hiring between 20-25 trusted musicians for a three-hour recording session in April. We feel strongly that musicians deserve to be paid for their work in bringing brand new music of our times to life! Musicians spend a lifetime perfecting their ability to play their instruments with beauty and finesse, so that we can enjoy the finished product for years to come. This is a chance to make a difference in the lives of these musicians and society as a whole with the collaborative, team-creation of accessible, modern music that speaks to and unites listeners around the world. Without these musicians, the music we create would simply remain unheard.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It seems like a lot of money, but when you divide $4000 between 25 musicians, you'll find that each musician will still be accepting very little for this project. If we raise more than this minimum, I'll be able to pay these musicians more for their time and effort! And any amount that we raise, even if we fall short, will go directly to these musicians.</p>
<p>Creating audible music is a lifetime effort of practice and dedication to the instrument; unfortunately the low price of consuming music these days doesn't cover the cost of paying our musicians, who create that music for us, very fairly. Much of the cost of music creation falls to the generous support of music-lovers like yourself. :)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>The best way to get these dedicated musicians paid for this project is to share this campaign wide and far! Whether you can chip in any amount or not, please use the tools Indiegogo has provided to share this opportunity with everyone you know!

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>In 2017 I will be celebrating 30 years in music!</p>
<p>WOW! It seemed like only yesterday, I was dragging my broom in our house in Gonaives, in front of every mirror pretending that I was singing for a huge crowd. Now 30 years later, this is no pretense: This is my life!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I feel immensely blessed for theses opportunities to bring Haitian music in so many countries around the globe: Japan, France, Seyschelles Island , Italy, Australia ,Burkina Faso, Guadeloupe, Martinique and more. Fortunate for having performed at venues such as Carnegie Hall, The Apollo theater, Lincoln Center, The Kennedy Center. Humbled and awed to share my songs with various presidents and dignitaries,</p>
<p>But more importantly, I am grateful for you! Because you are the fuel, the fire behind this body of work. </p>
<p>With 10 albums, and countless shows you have helped me share the beauty of Haitian culture,values, and musical traditions with the rest of the worl,and I am forever grateful!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong>How did it all happen?</strong></h2>
<p>Coming from a family with no musicians in the backdrop from previous generations, a family where there was just enough to pay for the school tuition and food, but not enough for music lessons. Who were the instrumental figures? what were the highs? the lows, the victories, the lessons?</p>
<p>Retracing all the ups and downs ,the wins, and especially the joy that it brings to dare carry a song in my suitcase, a flag and see the world together in a dance.</p>
<p>Emeline Passionately, is an opportunity for us, to create together a piece of work that reminds us that nothing is impossible. This is a human tale, The story of any soul striving to reach a dream that seems unreachable.</p>
<p>A story to fuel, inspire, to uplift to remind us that when we trust, when we work hard and give it our all, dreams lead to reality.<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>The power of wanting it so bad that walls will fall to let it BE! </strong></h3>
<p>This is an opportunity to not only share my story, but to tell the story of ""All dreamers who keep their feet on the ground""</p>
<h2>Where Do you Come in?</h2>
<p>When  you take a good look at  the profile of all my productions over the years, you will notice that for me quality is a must! For you nothing is too big... Only the very best!</p>
<p>Album productions/ concepts/ videos only the best!</p>
<p>I have the utmost respect for the trust you have invested in me.</p>
<p>This project is going to take hard work, and MONEY and this is where I need your full support to make this happen.</p>
<p>To travel to Haiti, Canada and various other states to meet and record the participants instrumental to the story  will require a lot. Travelling/ Filming crew/ studio recording /music and voice recording and editing this project will cost an estimate of $50,000.</p>
<p>We are shooting for an initial goal of $20,000 so we can get it started.</p>
<p>If you jump the net will appear!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>Sharing this story is not just sharing my story.</p>
<p>It is an opportunity to share with the world the <strong>VALUE</strong> of faith, commitment, and determination. It will serve as a tool to inspire youth all over Haiti, the US, and the world.</p>
<p>Combined with classes and workshops, this documentary can show the young people that <strong>ART</strong> initiate change. Art touches lives. It touches not just the receiver, but the creator as well.</p>
<p>Their dream is where it all starts.</p>
<p><strong>LETS START TOGETHER! LETS make this HAPPEN!</strong><br/> </p>
<p><strong>IT STARTS TODAY, WITH YOUR COMMITMENT.</strong></p>
<p>You can expect nothing less than the VERY best when you support this project.</p>
<p>Give What You Can, Share the Project!</p>
<p>We big up the big....But we cherish and value everything and anything that comes from your heart.</p>
<p>Please share the project via social media and through email with friends and family.</p>
<p>May what you give be multiplied! And thank you for the love and the trust.</p>

I feel immensely blessed for theses opportunities to bring Haitian music in so many countries around the globe: Japan, France, Seyschelles Island , Italy, Australia ,Burkina Faso, Guadeloupe, Martinique and more. Fortunate for having performed at venues such as Carnegie Hall, The Apollo theater, Lincoln Center, The Kennedy Center. Humbled and awed to share my songs with various presidents and dignitaries,
But more importantly, I am grateful for you! Because you are the fuel, the fire behind this body of work. 
With 10 albums, and countless shows you have helped me share the beauty of Haitian culture,values, and musical traditions with the rest of the worl,and I am forever grateful!
 
How did it all happen?
Coming from a family with no musicians in the backdrop from previous generations, a family where there was just enough to pay for the school tuition and food, but not enough for music lessons. Who were the instrumental figures? what were the highs? the lows, the victories, the lessons?
Retracing all the ups and downs ,the wins, and especially the joy that it brings to dare carry a song in my suitcase, a flag and see the world together in a dance.
Emeline Passionately, is an opportunity for us, to create together a piece of work that reminds us that nothing is impossible. This is a human tale, The story of any soul striving to reach a dream that seems unreachable.
A story to fuel, inspire, to uplift to remind us that when we trust, when we work hard and give it our all, dreams lead to reality. 
The power of wanting it so bad that walls will fall to let it BE! 
This is an opportunity to not only share my story, but to tell the story of ""All dreamers who keep their feet on the ground""
Where Do you Come in?
When  you take a good look at  the profile of all my productions over the years, you will notice that for me quality is a must! For you nothing is too big... Only the very best!
Album productions/ concepts/ videos only the best!
I have the utmost respect for the trust you have invested in me.
This project is going to take hard work, and MONEY and this is where I need your full support to make this happen.
To travel to Haiti, Canada and various other states to meet and record the participants instrumental to the story  will require a lot. Travelling/ Filming crew/ studio recording /music and voice recording and editing this project will cost an estimate of $50,000.
We are shooting for an initial goal of $20,000 so we can get it started.
If you jump the net will appear!
 
THE IMPACT
Sharing this story is not just sharing my story.
It is an opportunity to share with the world the VALUE of faith, commitment, and determination. It will serve as a tool to inspire youth all over Haiti, the US, and the world.
Combined with classes and workshops, this documentary can show the young people that ART initiate change. Art touches lives. It touches not just the receiver, but the creator as well.
Their dream is where it all starts.
LETS START TOGETHER! LETS make this HAPPEN! 
IT STARTS TODAY, WITH YOUR COMMITMENT.
You can expect nothing less than the VERY best when you support this project.
Give What You Can, Share the Project!
We big up the big....But we cherish and value everything and anything that comes from your heart.
Please share the project via social media and through email with friends and family.
May what you give be multiplied! And thank you for the love and the trust.

<p>which is when I penned my first song a few months before graduating college.  Music had always been a part of my life but it wasn't until then that I felt compelled to write something of my own. I had something to say.  Most of my writings remained scribbled up in my journals but a year ago, I decided to venture out and perform my original songs in NYC.  So I sought out open mics and landed a few gigs here and there which helped me overcome my fears and insecurities, not only as a performer, but as a person in general.  Most importantly, it gave me the opportunity to share my heart and writings with you all, which I hope you've enjoyed and been encouraged by!  So many have of you have been so supportive and have persistently asked me over the years when I'd have my own material out.  SO, here's your chance to <u><i>partner with me</i></u> in producing that album you've been waiting for!</p>

Dixon</a>, the Tony and Grammy nominated actor playing Aaron Burr, addressed him from the stage reading a statement on behalf of the cast, creative team and producers, basically saying, ""thank you for coming,"" and asking him to please address the concerns of <strong><i>""the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us...and uphold our inalienable rights.""</i></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/news/hamilton-mike-pence-booed-statement-in-full-watch-new-york-vice-president-elect-a7429251.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can read the full statement here</a>.</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">As anyone with half a brain cell can see--<strong><a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/news/mike-pence-response-incredible-talented-hamilton-broadway-musical-boos-cheers-speech-donald-trump-a7428566.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">including Mr. Pence</a></strong>--this incident was neither disruptive nor harassment by any reasonable stretch of the imagination.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">As anyone with a basic knowledge of the Constitution can see, this <i>was</i> an example of a group of professional artists respectfully exercising their First Amendment rights of freedom of speech, freedom to peaceably assemble, and freedom to petition the government for a redress of grievances.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">And as anyone involved with the performing arts knows, our work as artists has always gone far beyond just being shallow entertainment manufactured and distributed to turn a buck. And most especially a show like <i>Hamilton</i>.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">So, as soon as the video of Brandon V. Dixon's statement was posted to the <i>Hamilton</i> Facebook page, I made this comment on the post...which was essentially a more coarsely-worded tl;dr of everything I just said.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484760102/cccwmya0dlgsochvzonk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Woke up the next day to find it had amassed nearly 8,000 likes, and within two days it surpassed 30,000. With this came dozens of replies...and hundreds of angry trolls on my personal page and in my inbox. While I didn't experience any real threats to my safety, I did experience a barrage of belligerent ignorance--mostly people attempting to devalue me as an artist, and by extension devalue the artistic community as a whole.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">So naturally, I did what any sensible opportunistic attention whore--er, social ambassador-- would do: I directed them to my professional page, and spent the next few days responding to their messages, the good and the bad, with as much decorum, humor and factual information as possible. Not to change their minds, just to take the high road.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">It was a bizarre experience, but one I never regretted for a moment. Since I received this much backlash for a single comment, you can only imagine the tidal wave of bigotry, hatred, and threats that was unleashed upon the <i>Hamilton</i> team, and I was proud to have even a small opportunity to stand up for them, for the artistic community as a whole, and most importantly, for every citizen of ""the diverse America"" that Mr. Dixon's speech referenced.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">And at any rate, I've never been the type to let the trolls get me down. When I was a granola-crunching hippie nine-year-old who wanted to save the environment by spending my recess time cleaning up litter, a boy in my class disparagingly called me ""Eco-Girl."" And I thought, ""That would be a great superhero name."" So I made her a superhero. And I dressed like her for Halloween.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Likewise, when I had a substantial amount of Hamiltrolls saying, ""Boycott Ashley Wool,"" the thought that naturally followed was,</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">""Well, that's my album title.""</h2><p style=""text-align: center;"">I've been writing songs since I was seven, and this album has been in the works for a long time, but it felt like a directionless endeavor simmering on the back burner of my artistic brain...until that title revealed itself to me.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Now I can't imagine calling it anything else.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Many of my songs are acts of defiance. They are about addressing conflict head-on. They reveal sides of me that aren't always pretty, but are nevertheless real. It's my hope that this album will be, not only a direct extension of <i>my</i> most authentic self, but also a means to allow others to access their authentic selves--even people who don't agree with me.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">And what I've noticed about those people is that they always want to boycott people and entities that force them to look at themselves and their values differently. <i>Hamilton</i>. Beyonce. Colin Kaepernick. Planned Parenthood. Target, because of the bathroom thing.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">So I say...go ahead. Boycott me. I'm in excellent company.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Is this album going to make the world a better place?</strong></h2><p style=""text-align: center;"">In the words of Pablo Picasso, <strong><i>""Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.""</i></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">My work as a performer and a teaching artist (as well as my dad's background as a public school administrative professional) has shown me firsthand the immeasurable value of the performing arts in education, and I am dead tired of people treating the arts like a luxury instead of a necessity. No child should grow up thinking that the arts are worthless...that their artistic talents and passions are worthless...that if they choose to pursue the arts, they will never be taken seriously as full human beings because they ""only exist for our entertainment.""</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Well, I sure don't exist solely for entertainment. That's not all that I am. That's not all I want my album to be.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Therefore, a portion of the profits from this album will be donated to the <a href=""https://centerforartsed.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Center for Arts Education</a>, which is committed to funding and maintaining arts education programs in the New York City public schools.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Where's my money going if I contribute?</strong></h2><p style=""text-align: center;"">Well, in the literal sense, you're helping pay for:</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The <strong>time, talent and energy</strong> of top-notch producers, arrangers, musicians, and co-writers (other than myself)</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The <strong>equipment</strong> we're using in a major NYC recording studio</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The <strong>distribution</strong> costs of digital and hard copies, as well as distribution across streaming platforms such as Spotify and Google Play.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Coffee</strong>, probably. (I'm just being honest here.)</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">But in the metaphorical sense, I'd like to believe that your money is one small-but-mighty way to make a statement to people who...</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">...say <strong>art isn't important</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">...think that artists cannot or <strong>should not use their platforms</strong> however they please</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">...think <strong>they have more ownership</strong> of those platforms--and by extension, more ownership of us as human beings--than we do.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">...<strong>erroneously measure your worth</strong> as an artist or a person in how much money you make, or what you look like, or whether or not THEY PERSONALLY have ever heard of you.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>I'm broke AF. Can I do other stuff to support the project?</strong></h2><p style=""text-align: center;"">Heck yeah! Here are a couple quick and free things you can do right this second, no matter who you are!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Follow me</strong> on <u><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/ashleywoolperforms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a></u>, <u><a href=""http://www.twitter.com/morninggloryash"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a></u>, <u><a href=""http://youtube.com/ashleywool"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouTube</a></u>, and <u><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/morninggloryash/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a></u>! Followers help to elevate my profile and make me look famous, so that people with more money than you are more likely to invest in my stuff.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Follow me</strong> on <u>Spotify</u> too, and have a listen to some of my old stuff if you feel so inclined. It's much older and has a very different sound from what I'm going for now, but it's still there and it's still decent, I think. (And anytime you stream one of my songs, I make a tiny bit of money. Hey, 0.04 cents is 0.04 cents.)</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Share this campaign</strong> on your social media accounts. Bonus points if you add some reverse psychology to fit the boycott theme--e.g. ""Definitely DO NOT support this artist! She is just another whiny libtard no-talent hack and deserves zero of your heard-earned dollars! #BoycottAshleyWool""</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Be an active champion of art and diversity in your daily life.</strong> Check out the projects of your other friends in the arts. See a show--there are plenty of free ones out there--even if it's not normally the kind of thing you'd be interested in. Openly challenge people's perceptions on what artists are and what they do and why they do it.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Can I donate perks in lieu of (or in addition to) monetary contribution?</h2><p style=""text-align: center;"">Yes! Absolutely!</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">I'm most interested in perks that are directly related to the performing arts and artists' needs--for instance, classes or coaching sessions (voice/acting/dance), headshot photography, audition videography, any sort of music production services (transposing, transcribing, studio work, etc.), discounts on studio or performance spaces, show tickets, and the like.

Dixon</strong> so I can thank him for being an excellent human and for indirectly contributing to my paradigm-shifting fifteen minutes of fame.</p></div>","It all started when Mike Pence......attended Hamilton on Broadway, less than two weeks after we found out he was going to be VP of the United States.After the curtain call, Brandon V. Dixon, the Tony and Grammy nominated actor playing Aaron Burr, addressed him from the stage reading a statement on behalf of the cast, creative team and producers, basically saying, ""thank you for coming,"" and asking him to please address the concerns of ""the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us...and uphold our inalienable rights.""You can read the full statement here.As anyone with half a brain cell can see--including Mr. Pence--this incident was neither disruptive nor harassment by any reasonable stretch of the imagination.As anyone with a basic knowledge of the Constitution can see, this was an example of a group of professional artists respectfully exercising their First Amendment rights of freedom of speech, freedom to peaceably assemble, and freedom to petition the government for a redress of grievances.And as anyone involved with the performing arts knows, our work as artists has always gone far beyond just being shallow entertainment manufactured and distributed to turn a buck. And most especially a show like Hamilton.So, as soon as the video of Brandon V. Dixon's statement was posted to the Hamilton Facebook page, I made this comment on the post...which was essentially a more coarsely-worded tl;dr of everything I just said.Woke up the next day to find it had amassed nearly 8,000 likes, and within two days it surpassed 30,000. With this came dozens of replies...and hundreds of angry trolls on my personal page and in my inbox. While I didn't experience any real threats to my safety, I did experience a barrage of belligerent ignorance--mostly people attempting to devalue me as an artist, and by extension devalue the artistic community as a whole.So naturally, I did what any sensible opportunistic attention whore--er, social ambassador-- would do: I directed them to my professional page, and spent the next few days responding to their messages, the good and the bad, with as much decorum, humor and factual information as possible. Not to change their minds, just to take the high road.It was a bizarre experience, but one I never regretted for a moment. Since I received this much backlash for a single comment, you can only imagine the tidal wave of bigotry, hatred, and threats that was unleashed upon the Hamilton team, and I was proud to have even a small opportunity to stand up for them, for the artistic community as a whole, and most importantly, for every citizen of ""the diverse America"" that Mr. Dixon's speech referenced.And at any rate, I've never been the type to let the trolls get me down. When I was a granola-crunching hippie nine-year-old who wanted to save the environment by spending my recess time cleaning up litter, a boy in my class disparagingly called me ""Eco-Girl."" And I thought, ""That would be a great superhero name."" So I made her a superhero. And I dressed like her for Halloween.Likewise, when I had a substantial amount of Hamiltrolls saying, ""Boycott Ashley Wool,"" the thought that naturally followed was,""Well, that's my album title.""I've been writing songs since I was seven, and this album has been in the works for a long time, but it felt like a directionless endeavor simmering on the back burner of my artistic brain...until that title revealed itself to me.Now I can't imagine calling it anything else.Many of my songs are acts of defiance. They are about addressing conflict head-on. They reveal sides of me that aren't always pretty, but are nevertheless real. It's my hope that this album will be, not only a direct extension of my most authentic self, but also a means to allow others to access their authentic selves--even people who don't agree with me.And what I've noticed about those people is that they always want to boycott people and entities that force them to look at themselves and their values differently. Hamilton. Beyonce. Colin Kaepernick. Planned Parenthood. Target, because of the bathroom thing.So I say...go ahead. Boycott me. I'm in excellent company.Is this album going to make the world a better place?In the words of Pablo Picasso, ""Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.""My work as a performer and a teaching artist (as well as my dad's background as a public school administrative professional) has shown me firsthand the immeasurable value of the performing arts in education, and I am dead tired of people treating the arts like a luxury instead of a necessity. No child should grow up thinking that the arts are worthless...that their artistic talents and passions are worthless...that if they choose to pursue the arts, they will never be taken seriously as full human beings because they ""only exist for our entertainment.""Well, I sure don't exist solely for entertainment. That's not all that I am. That's not all I want my album to be.Therefore, a portion of the profits from this album will be donated to the Center for Arts Education, which is committed to funding and maintaining arts education programs in the New York City public schools.Where's my money going if I contribute?Well, in the literal sense, you're helping pay for:The time, talent and energy of top-notch producers, arrangers, musicians, and co-writers (other than myself)The equipment we're using in a major NYC recording studioThe distribution costs of digital and hard copies, as well as distribution across streaming platforms such as Spotify and Google Play.Coffee, probably. (I'm just being honest here.)But in the metaphorical sense, I'd like to believe that your money is one small-but-mighty way to make a statement to people who......say art isn't important...think that artists cannot or should not use their platforms however they please...think they have more ownership of those platforms--and by extension, more ownership of us as human beings--than we do....erroneously measure your worth as an artist or a person in how much money you make, or what you look like, or whether or not THEY PERSONALLY have ever heard of you.I'm broke AF. Can I do other stuff to support the project?Heck yeah! Here are a couple quick and free things you can do right this second, no matter who you are!Follow me on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram! Followers help to elevate my profile and make me look famous, so that people with more money than you are more likely to invest in my stuff.Follow me on Spotify too, and have a listen to some of my old stuff if you feel so inclined. It's much older and has a very different sound from what I'm going for now, but it's still there and it's still decent, I think. (And anytime you stream one of my songs, I make a tiny bit of money. Hey, 0.04 cents is 0.04 cents.)Share this campaign on your social media accounts. Bonus points if you add some reverse psychology to fit the boycott theme--e.g. ""Definitely DO NOT support this artist! She is just another whiny libtard no-talent hack and deserves zero of your heard-earned dollars! #BoycottAshleyWool""Be an active champion of art and diversity in your daily life. Check out the projects of your other friends in the arts. See a show--there are plenty of free ones out there--even if it's not normally the kind of thing you'd be interested in. Openly challenge people's perceptions on what artists are and what they do and why they do it.Can I donate perks in lieu of (or in addition to) monetary contribution?Yes! Absolutely!I'm most interested in perks that are directly related to the performing arts and artists' needs--for instance, classes or coaching sessions (voice/acting/dance), headshot photography, audition videography, any sort of music production services (transposing, transcribing, studio work, etc.), discounts on studio or performance spaces, show tickets, and the like. But if you have any product or service that you would like to contribute as a perk, please shoot me a message and we will talk!I'm an artist too! Can I help you make stuff?Of course you're an artist too! Picasso said you were born that way. And I'm always down for a barter, if you ever need a singer/actress/dancer/writer/barista/teaching artist/babysitter/cat sitter/driver/usher/Disney princess. I'm actively seeking people to do the following:Become live band members--specifically seeking guitar, bass, percussion, and synths.Create piano/vocal books of my music, so theatre geeks can use them for pop-rock auditions.Direct a music video or two, if you're so inspired and inclined.Help me re-learn the independent music scene, since I've been in semi-retirement from it since 2008ish. Know a great indie radio station or podcast you think my songs would be a fit for? A venue or open-mic event that I simply HAVE to play at? A music blogger or tastemaker who'd love my stuff? The right way to pitch songs to film/TV/Internet projects...or maybe YOUR film or TV project?Introduce me to Brandon V.

<h3> </h3>
<p>Hello!  My name is Mike (M.T.) Walker.  I'm a singer and songwriter from Toronto.  I am starting a campaign to raise money for my debut album. </p>
<p>I am not new at music, however, this is a new avenue I am taking a risk on (and it took some coaxing from others who believe in it!).</p>
<p>I was in a band called ""Turn off the Stars"" in the early 2000's.  We toured a lot and were fortunate enough to play with some pretty well known artists.  Since then I've been focusing on folk songs that represent me.  All of my favourite artists have been able to use their music to reach people in powerful ways.  Music has healed me, taken me somewhere else, and has even changed what I think at times.  My goal is to hopefully create an album that can do the same for my listeners.</p>
<p>If you're a music lover, a friend, or a fan of what I've written in the past, I am asking you to please help me accomplish a dream I've had for the last 10 years (really, ask my wife, its been a well-waited dream!) As a fan of music myself, I have enjoyed being part of a journey an artist has taken.  Please join me in my journey and be a part of getting my music to people.</p>
<p>I have an amazing producer behind me and great musicians ready to contribute.  This all costs money and that is why I need your help.  As a contributor to my project, you will not only receive some pretty great perks for supporting me, you will also become part of an encouraging team of supporters (that I am very much in need of).  I really want this to feel like its not just me doing this on my own, but that I have people believing in me enough to help me make this happen.</p>
<p>The amount of funding I will need is $16,000.00.  This sounds like a lot, however there is a lot going into making this album something really special. I have multiple professional musicians that are willing to lend their talents to the album.  One of them being a very respected violinist and string arranger from Los Angeles.  There are mastering costs, and packaging costs.  Myself and Ben Pelchat, the producer of the album, have decided to manufacture the album in vinyl format.  We feel this will best represent the warm sound I am going for with my music.  All these elements to making the album sure do add up!</p>
<p>If you so graciously decide to give towards the making of my album, there are definitely some great perks once you have given.  When you give, you automatically get a copy of the album, but the perks go up from there.  There are opportunities to have me play a house concert, cover your favourite song on YouTube, have a songwriting session, a personal mention in the liner notes of the album, or even an executive producer credit on the album.</p>
<p>If you aren't able to contribute financially, no problem.  I would love it if you could spread the word about my campaign to friends that you think may be interested. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. If you would please help me make this album happen, I would be so grateful!</p>

<p>In 1999 my dad passed away leaving his old scooter in the garage. My brother drove it for a couple of years and then as time went by he moved from 2 wheeler to 4 wheeler.  During one Christmas day when my brother called me up in US and told me about a theme on which he is working I was really excited. The song was based on a scooter and a girls passion to ride. The song is about 2.34 min , a short one but definitely the video would give you a nostalgia , for those who have rode the old vespa and chetak scooters.. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For over five years,  we have been travelling North America wide, sharing the songs that God has given us to powerfully touch lives of all nationalities.  We have received testimonies from all over the world of the joy, faith, inspiration, healing and presence of God that our music has brought to listeners.</p>
<p>While we have added two instrumental albums to our discography since 2013 (<i>The Heavenly Peace,</i> 2014; and <i>Beginnings</i>, 2015), we have not released a full album with vocals since <i>Visions of Messiah</i> in 2013. Everywhere we travel, people are continually requesting that anointed blend of heavenly vocals and inspired violin.  It is the fusion of these two that has most ministered to people through our concerts and previous recordings.</p>
<p><i>Draw Me Close</i> has been much anticipated. We have been sharing many of the songs continent- wide for over two years, and after every event, the question is <strong>""When is this CD coming out?""</strong>  This is where YOU come in! </p>
<p>By supporting this campaign, you will be helping us release powerful and anointed new music that has the potential to reach into tens of thousands of homes worldwide.  You will be helping to bring healing, comfort, joy, encouragement and most importantly, the Word of God, into the lives of thousands who truly need it.</p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p><i>Draw Me Close</i>, Dan and Melissa's first vocal worship CD since <i>Visions of Messiah</i> (2013) will be a unique project in that it is an international collaborative effort between “next generation” Messianic believers from Canada, the U.S. and Israel.  The project includes not only Dan and Melissa’s anointed songs and styles, but also the contributions of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Eli Ben Moshe</strong> (Future Vision Studios, <i>Israel</i>), editing and mastering</li>
<li>
<strong>Andrew Gudgeon</strong> (Messianic worship leader, <i>Maryland</i>), guitars</li>
<li>
<strong>David Wein </strong>(Rabbi in training, <i>Virginia</i>), songwriting</li>
<li>
<strong>Scott Ogden</strong> (Messianic songwriter, <i>Canada</i>), songwriting</li>
<li>and others</li>
</ul>

</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
For over five years,  we have been travelling North America wide, sharing the songs that God has given us to powerfully touch lives of all nationalities.  We have received testimonies from all over the world of the joy, faith, inspiration, healing and presence of God that our music has brought to listeners.
While we have added two instrumental albums to our discography since 2013 (The Heavenly Peace, 2014; and Beginnings, 2015), we have not released a full album with vocals since Visions of Messiah in 2013. Everywhere we travel, people are continually requesting that anointed blend of heavenly vocals and inspired violin.  It is the fusion of these two that has most ministered to people through our concerts and previous recordings.
Draw Me Close has been much anticipated. We have been sharing many of the songs continent- wide for over two years, and after every event, the question is ""When is this CD coming out?""  This is where YOU come in! 
By supporting this campaign, you will be helping us release powerful and anointed new music that has the potential to reach into tens of thousands of homes worldwide.  You will be helping to bring healing, comfort, joy, encouragement and most importantly, the Word of God, into the lives of thousands who truly need it.
The Project
Draw Me Close, Dan and Melissa's first vocal worship CD since Visions of Messiah (2013) will be a unique project in that it is an international collaborative effort between “next generation” Messianic believers from Canada, the U.S. and Israel.  The project includes not only Dan and Melissa’s anointed songs and styles, but also the contributions of:


Eli Ben Moshe (Future Vision Studios, Israel), editing and mastering

Andrew Gudgeon (Messianic worship leader, Maryland), guitars

David Wein (Rabbi in training, Virginia), songwriting

Scott Ogden (Messianic songwriter, Canada), songwriting
and others

The album is inherently Messianic: beginning with the Sh’ma; ending with the Aaronic Blessing; and centering on the person of Yeshua (Jesus).  Both powerful and intimate, filled with victory and faith, and focused on the Word, we believe that this album will be a tremendous blessing to the body of Messiah.
Songlist:
Sh’ma (Deut. 6:4)Against Your Enemies (Deut. 20:3-4)El Shaddai (Psalm 91)Hodu L’Adonai (Psalm 136)Draw Me Close (Psalm 27, Jaacov/James 4:8)Yeshua (1 Corinthians 6:19-20)Peaceful (Isaiah 26:3, Psalm 1)Blessed is the Man (Jeremiah 17:7)Message on the Hills (Mark 1:22)We Wait / O Mighty One (Psalm 33, Psalm 24)Aaronic Blessing (Numbers 6:24-26)Bonus: Karaive Oti Elaicha  (Psalm 27, Jaacov/James 4:8)
 

What We Need & What You Get
We are looking to raise $15,000 CAD toward the release of this album.

$7000 Recording time, musicians
$4000 Editing and Mastering
$1500  Production of first 1000 copies
$1500  Promotion and Advertising (including printing songbooks)
$1000 Indigogo campaign administrative fees


The Impact
When we hear testimonies (via e-mail, written letters, messages on Facebook) of how people have been touched and blessed  by our music, it reminds us how urgent it is that we continue going strong in this calling and that we release this much-awaited CD.

<h3>Nine Toes the Bard </h3>
<p>The song that started it all, ""Nine Toes the Bard"" written August 2015, is a story of a Bard with the unfortunate curse that no one can remember her name.  A Muse was born, and her story began to unfold.  In June 2016, I (Mama Gina) wound up in a St. Louis, MO hospital and lost a toe.  And now, I am truly Nine Toes the Bard.  Her world is amazing, her companions are genuinely strong and humorous, the music is astounding!  We are quite healthy now, and as I've toured this year, Nine Toes has taken the stage ... and she's ready for her very own first full length CD.</p>
<p>Nine Toes makes these Bardic tales and characters come to life with each performance, and we want to share the music with the world.  You likely already know this, and I'll say it again ... good studio time, a great engineer with an awesome ear, recording, extra-special musicians, quality production, mixing, mastering, printing beautiful and great-sounding CDs ... that takes a LOT of time (which we have plenty of) and a bit of money to achieve (that's where you come in).  Nine Toes can take over the world - YES!  World domination! Oh, um, I mean, make an absolutely fabulous CD that EVERYONE will want to hear over and over again ... with your help!  </p>
<p><b>DONATE AND GET FABULOUS STUFF IN RETURN!</b></p>
<p>You'll be rewarded for your generosity. Be ye Pirate, Dragon Lover, Naughty, or just love the Bard, there are perks for every one of you.  You'll choose to receive the music as a CD or digitally, and there are specially designed T-shirts and stickers.  There is graphic art inspired by Nine Toes the Bard and created especially for YOU - can anyone say, ""I want THAT DRAGON art print on my wall!""??  There are even opportunities to hang out with the Bard in studio and join The Floggin' Frog Chorus on a couple songs.  </p>
<p>Speakin' of The Floggin' Frog, there are four songs that will be recorded, that will not be on the CD.  They are the <strong>Nine Toes Naughty</strong>, and will be available as a digital download for those of you who DARE!  </p>
<p>Please check out all the rewards, find the donation amount that is right for you, and support this very worthy Bard.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WILL I DO WITH YOUR DONATIONS?</strong></p>
<p>$5,000 is truly needed to fund the creation of this CD.  I tour year round, sharing my Muse at festivals, shops, and house concerts, and while I have enough to pay my car insurance and my cell phone bill, and the occasional vehicle repair, most of my budget on the road goes to getting to the next gig.  I LOVE THIS LIFE, but I'm not gettin' rich.  A good day is breaking even and a warm bed to sleep in (and I do so love your generosity in opening your homes and hearths to me as I travel).  Alas, there is no extra for recording ... </p>
<p>Studio time, paying my lovely engineer and a couple of very fine musicians to play a couple of sweet tracks, recording, mixing and mastering - all that will cost around $3,000.</p>
<p>Printing the actual CDs will be roughly $1,500.</p>
<p>And $500 should cover promotional/marketing stuff, T-shirts, and stickers.</p>
<p>This is a very tight budget, and my very incredible graphic artist is donating his time and talent to this project.  </p>
<p>That's the bare bones.  We aren't doing anything fancy, and yet, we'll create the absolutely BEST CD that we are able to produce!  And YOU will make it possible.  And you will get great music in return.</p>
<p><strong>WORLD DOMINATION - ER, A FABULOUS NINE TOES THE BARD CD</strong></p>
<p>Seriously, Nine Toes is a TRUE BARD.  Her stories, her songs, her life will touch you and you will be changed by her music.  Yes, there are drinking songs.  Yes, there are hilarious stories.  And there is music that will make you weep ... that will make you think ... that will make you want to find your own voice and step out bravely into the world and make a difference.  That's what this comes down to.  Nine Toes and I want to make this CD because we think ... no, we KNOW that this music will make a positive impact, will make a true and good difference in the world.</p>
<p>So, please support Nine Toes, choose your donation amount and rewards, and join us on this journey to create this CD.</p>
<p><b>HOW ELSE CAN YOU HELP?</b></p>
<p>Glad you asked!  Share Nine Toes' story and our need for a little of the King's silver with all your friends and family - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest - just share this page with EVERYONE!  Get on the e-mail list at <a href=""http://www.mamaginamusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mamaginamusic.com</a> and get updates on all our adventures.  Check out the tour dates there, and come to a festival or concert, or host your own Nine Toes the Bard house concert!  Throw a Pirate Party, and bring the Bard!  And if you have a little time on your hands, and you're pretty good with this social media thing, I could use a couple extra hands gettin' the word out ... email me at mnemosyne7@hotmail.com and ask me how you can get on board with the Bard!</p>
<p>MUCH LOVE AND THE BARD'S DEEPEST GRATITUDE</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Brian Teubl a husband, father and singer/songwriter from Cleveland, Ohio.          I have been in love with music all of my life and have always wanted to record an album of my original songs.

<p>I became a father in 2014 and welcome my second son this year in May. With a family it is difficult to financially support my musical goals and aspirations.</p>

SCRAPE Records - The Label Launch Party and Concert headlined by ZIMMERS HOLE in 2018! 
Serious work begins on the brand new ZIMMERS HOLE studio album on SCRAPE Records.

SCRAPE Records - The Label will focus on specializing in limited edition/small run pressings on various formats. Once they're gone, they're gone. You snooze, you're not METAL. All product will have a high attention to detail. Including, but not limited to, coloured vinyl, digi-paks/books, assorted inserts, autographed product, clothing, paraphernalia and more. 
As fans ourselves, we know the quality and attention to detail you expect and SCRAPE can deliver. We have loads of killer ideas on how to make SCRAPE unique and stand out from the rest. However, these ideas do come at a cost. With your help, we can raise the additional funds and in return you'll get some wicked product!
SCRAPE Records - The Label will stay true to its roots working with bands of the Progressive, Death, Glam, Thrash, Fusion, Power, Viking, Shred, Speed, Doom, Black Metal and Hard Rock variety. We are currently in discussions of signing some bands. Send more our way! 
SCRAPE Records and ZIMMERS HOLE and  future label signings thank you in advance for your support. Every little bit helps and it all ads up. Support your METAL! 
We Ain't Done!Check out our plethora of exclusive funding packages that are only available through this campaign featuring a variety of rare, autographed and one-of-a-kind items available from such artists as ZIMMERS HOLE, DEVIN TOWNSEND, ENSLAVED, HELLYEAH, SABATON, GRAVEYARD, OBITUARY and from SCRAPE Records! Need more crap? You can also support us by making a purchase at our SCRAPE Discogs store featuring nearly 5000 new CDs and Vinyl. These titles are available and ready to ship now!
What We Need & What You Get

Our target goal is 20K. We think this is attainable, but only with your help. Without the ""DISCIPLE"" there is no 'SCRAPE"". Deadline is Midnight New Years Eve!
SCRAPE has nearly 5000 ""Likes"" on Facebook alone. If 1000 of those ""Likes"" or 1/5 of our total ""Likes"" each contribute $20, we'll reach our 20k goal!
500 ""Disciples"" contribute $40 each, we'll reach our 20k goal! 
666 ""Disciples"" contribute $30 each, we'll reach our 20k goal! 
In the unfortunate event we don't reach our 20K or our 5K goal, it will definitely slow down our progress and we'll have to adjust our budgets accordingly. We have tons of wicked ideas! You can make them a reality! Spread the word!
In the unfortunate event this campaign totally tanks (less than 5k), SCRAPE will still honour all items purchased through this campaign that isn't a ZIMMERS HOLE reissue or SCRAPE Vinyl sampler. 
​We can also accept your contributions via E-transfer or Paypal to orders@scraperecords.com

</div></div>","Hello Everyone!
Thanks for reading my thing! I have been obsessing over this for a long time so I will now go ahead and put all my cards on the table..
Basically, late last year I finally plucked up the courage to start a music project under the name Velveteen and finally got to work on some unfinished musings. Luckily enough my first demo received a little bit of love from the public so Im hoping now to take that next step and reach out to the US and record my debut EP. 

""Mess"" (above) Is a song about being in a relationship with somebody who tends to drag up the past, Its a harsh reality and predicament, something I believe many of us can relate to. I tend to write from my personal experiences and switch them around so that I can stand in the shoes of the other person and see both sides of the story. Performing and Writing music makes me feel free, It helps me cope. 

I can't imagine not performing and writing music. To me, it's not a want, it's a need. A melody might pop into my head, and I just have to write it down or i'll go insane. And there's nothing in the world like writing something and performing it for a musician whom you respect, and having them say, ""wow, you wrote that? that was beautiful."" Not that I write just for a positive response. writing music is like... hm. having a child I guess. It's whiny, It's needy, It takes up all your time to feed the stinking thing but then you get to watch as the child grows and matures. You give of yourself but receive so much in return.
Ive always had a longing to travel overseas to pursue music. With your kind donations - you will not only help me achieve the great goal of making this happen, but furthermore; you will allow my inner visions to come to life as I've always dreamt they could!I believe when an opportunity shows up and it feels right, you gotta go with it!

“I have not always chosen the safest path. I've made my mistakes, plenty of them. I sometimes jump too soon and fail to appreciate the consequences. But I've learned something important along the way: I've learned to heed the call of my heart. I've learned that the safest path is not always the best path and I've learned that the voice of fear is not always to be trusted.” ― Steve Goodier



What the funds will be used for
Pay for session musicians overseas
Recording time & engineer 
Mastering & mixing 
Anything left over would be used to film a music video for my new track Mess!Those who know me know I'm a hardworking Individual and usually not the one to ask for help, But I figure I would give it a shot! and to be frank I need your help
I am aiming to make it there this year! every bone in my body wants this so badly and ANY support is greatly appreciated. 
Thank you so much to those who have already loved and supported me and I hope this adventure makes you as excited as I am! Please help get the word out there! 

Lets do this!

She returned to Perth, Australia forming the five piece indie pop band that has been distinguishing themselves in the Western Australian music industry though their dynamic sound and versatile original music. Velveteen made it's industry debut in mid 2014 at the sold out Astor Theatre which has catered to artists such as Chet Faker, Kimbra and Cat Empire. With some very exciting support slots coming up and a few new hit songs on the way,Velveteen is one to watch out for.

<b>About the project </b>
</h4>
<p><b>Relic Of the Mothership</b> <b>is a project I've actually been working on and off for about 3 years now.</b> It started off as an album, but due to many obstacles, lack of time, inadequate working space, and of course money I haven't been able to complete it the way I would of liked to a couple years ago. Though over time I have released a couple of songs that would have been a part of that album. Now I would like to re-package the project into a smaller 'EP' format instead to give a look into what a full length album from me would be like. <b>It will be a mixture of released and unreleased songs as some of them are interconnected with musical interludes.</b> I plan to make it free to download for all those who supported before the release, free online for the world to stream via soundcloud and more, available to buy higher quality digital copies elsewhere, CDs, and <b>a version mastered specifically to enjoy on vinyl is something I hope to do as well!</b> </p>

</div><div>
<div>Now I'll tell you how I plan to use it.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<b style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px;"">Production</b><br/>
</div>
<div>
<b> If I had to pay someone else</b> to fill the roles of the producer, songwriter, composer, tracking &amp; mixing engineer, as many other solo artists do, <b>the budget would be crazy.</b> However, as one person wearing all those hats and being the solo artist, its a very demanding workload, but I wouldn't have it any other way for this project. Meeting this goal will not only grant me the money need to make some minor investments, but give me the time, space and wherewithal to switch roles with a sense of perspective, without having to constantly scatter my energy to make ends meet and complete the project within a reasonable time frame. Most of the music is written and composed, Im just missing some recording and time to edit/arrange/mix. <b>I don't require a lot of expenses</b> to do it, just what I need to keep things going. </div>
<div>Mastering is a very delicate process and should be treated with lots of care. So that will be one of the things I will be allocating money towards to save time and ensure a final result of top level quality.</div>
<h4><b>Releasing music </b></h4>
<div>
<b>Making a song available on iTunes or Spotify, or 'noticeable' by YouTube, etc costs money that must be paid in advance.</b> Especially pressing music on CD's and vinyl. Usually the sales from a release on bandcamp provides just enough to front the costs to make it available on other sites. That and an occasional splurge on a cowbell or some acoustic foam:-)<br/>
</div>
<div>
<b>Reaching this goal will make it possible for me to submit a project on all the various streaming sites and have physical copies on CD, vinyl (maybe more) etc ready BEFORE the actual release.</b> Its one of the reason why many artists go forth with record labels. It's something I've always wanted to provide but have never been able to afford to do. I would like to do it on a very small scale and let sales determine whether more should be pressed.</div>
<h4><b>Music Video </b></h4>
<div>
<b>I was lucky</b> to have met up with the same guy who filmed and produced my very first music video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz-4QG-5Tro&amp;list=PLG1lYWViHkepWPLDiKfXGV2xA0udu5GOG&amp;index=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Keep On Dancing""</a>. It turned out he was working in NYC at the same time I was there recently. He and a colleague offered to help create visuals for my latest release ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_o73P2hQuk&amp;list=PLG1lYWViHkepWPLDiKfXGV2xA0udu5GOG&amp;index=2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Temu's Talkbox Groove</a>"". They really went out of their way to make it happen, changed travel dates put up money out of their own pockets, I had nothing. We did a 18 hour outdoor/indoor shoot, they took care of everything and are now looking into the editing. For professionals of their caliber, surely $1500 normally wouldn't cover the work and risks they took. <b>The least I can do is try to raise something symbolic for their work</b>, it would have never happened if it weren't for them.</div>
<div>
<b style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px;"">Promotion and Merchandise</b><br/>
</div>
<div>Having a budget for these two aspects give the opportunity to invest in building promotional content, PR packages to get the word out, and ensuring quality merchandise to be prepared for whenever I hit the road.</div>
<div> <b>It's not imperative to me that this EP becomes a 'massive smash hit success' but more so that I can gain perspective on the entire process</b>, the market, more work as a solo act, and whats the most effective aspects to focus on for future projects.  </div>

My name is Temu, Im a Funk/Soul/R&B/HipHop solo artist, songwriter, composer, singer, producer, dancer, talkbox player, multi-musician and all around performer/entertainer. I've been active in the international urban dance (popping) community over the last few years through my musical contributions. Since popping and funk music go hand in hand so well, most of the music I make is meant to be uplifting, occasionally thought provoking, whilst maintaining a 'danceable' groove, musical depth and complexity. Im looking to raise funds to complete a relatively new funky project EP called ""Relic of the Mothership"". The plan is for it to be released in late May.  





I have never been signed to a major record/publishing label of any sort. And Im totally ok with that. My reputation since growing up in New York City to my livelihood and survival as an adult living in Europe, has relied solely on my level of skill within the arts from one degree to another. I like the idea of being an independent artist and having control over my own destiny. But it can be tough at times, however instead of knocking on record labels doors in vein to 'sign' me, I'd rather try another approach by reaching out to YOU, my network of friends, family and supporters worldwide to help me complete this next project and ultimately pave the way for more people other than myself, an opportunity to create a lifestyle change. I believe helping each other to help themselves is the way to go. 


About the project 

Relic Of the Mothership is a project I've actually been working on and off for about 3 years now. It started off as an album, but due to many obstacles, lack of time, inadequate working space, and of course money I haven't been able to complete it the way I would of liked to a couple years ago. Though over time I have released a couple of songs that would have been a part of that album. Now I would like to re-package the project into a smaller 'EP' format instead to give a look into what a full length album from me would be like. It will be a mixture of released and unreleased songs as some of them are interconnected with musical interludes. I plan to make it free to download for all those who supported before the release, free online for the world to stream via soundcloud and more, available to buy higher quality digital copies elsewhere, CDs, and a version mastered specifically to enjoy on vinyl is something I hope to do as well! 

You Help Me Keep The World Dancing

I've spent my life developing my skills, and the last few years working hard to build an adequate home studio while keeping my head above water that I am blessed to wake up to everyday. This 5+ year old frankenstein of a laptop, the one Im typing from now, despite its cracked screen and many breakdowns is the same laptop I used to create Boogaloo Blues, or record the talkbox work of Gramatik's ""Talkbox Intended"",  the infamous 'Looking at Me' talkbox acapella which has made its way through producers computers across the globe, along with so many other songs that people enjoy and dance to. Your support will help me most importantly keep this workspace afloat, build further, continue collaborating with artists worldwide, and ultimately continue bringing you some slamming music to make you feel good. 
Here's 50+ videos of people from all over the world; battling, performing and practicing to my music!


Now I'll tell you how I plan to use it.


Production


 If I had to pay someone else to fill the roles of the producer, songwriter, composer, tracking & mixing engineer, as many other solo artists do, the budget would be crazy. However, as one person wearing all those hats and being the solo artist, its a very demanding workload, but I wouldn't have it any other way for this project.

For professionals of their caliber, surely $1500 normally wouldn't cover the work and risks they took. The least I can do is try to raise something symbolic for their work, it would have never happened if it weren't for them.

Promotion and Merchandise

Having a budget for these two aspects give the opportunity to invest in building promotional content, PR packages to get the word out, and ensuring quality merchandise to be prepared for whenever I hit the road.
 It's not imperative to me that this EP becomes a 'massive smash hit success' but more so that I can gain perspective on the entire process, the market, more work as a solo act, and whats the most effective aspects to focus on for future projects.  
All in all
Production (time, work, expenses)-$2500
Mastering- $ 500
Digital Release/CD/Vinyl pressing (approx/up to- 250 copies)$ 1500

Music Video $1500
Online Promo/Merchandise $1000

The Worst That Can Happen...


 Is that I would eventually put out the project anyway! Just maybe not in all of its $7K glory and it may take a little longer to finish.

Reaching this goal will help me mobilize a small and effective team and learn more about the entire process from conceptualizing a song to selling merchandise on tour. And most importantly it'll give me incite as to how to help self-empower other upcoming local/international artists that I currently work with.
The vinyl & cd duplication would be the first to go or downgrade If I couldn't raise enough funding for example. Even less than 50% of the budget would still make it happen. I'm very aware that there are much more important things going on in the world and Im not trying to ask it to stop to give me money. What matters right now is that I keep giving something to the people that are already supporting and possibly gain the interest of a few more. 
The only thing to consider is that as of now, Im just one person managing all of this. I'll be promoting this campaign, reaching out to as many of my collected friends, family, supporters, followers and 'likers' as I possibly can. Pulling together logistics, communicating with duplication companies, handling every aspect of my online presence from uploading material to interviews to promoting my own merchandise, fulfilling perks, and a whole bunch of other things I have no experience with are in store for me on this adventure so, no matter how this goes, the one thing I ask for is your patience. 
However, if things go better than what I planned for, you can expect to see more perks, more forms of access to the music, maybe it could fund a full length album! Who knows?! 

Just Because You Don't Have Money...

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>As a child growing up in Fairbanks in the 80's and 90's, I took our arts scene for granted because I assumed everyone had the same access to music, dance, and art that people in Fairbanks (especially children) did. Little did I know at the time, but the education I received from both public and private arts and music programs was world-class, and it was that education and experience that allowed me to become a successful professional musician in NYC. Now, I come back to Alaska many times each year to teach and perform (and get out of the big city!) My goal since moving away has
been to return as frequently as possible to give back to the community.

<p>This summer, I'll use my festival

Alaska’s premier annual music and dance festivals, which eventually will attract
participants from throughout Alaska and the nation. </p>

Both Kurt and I have significant experience organizing arts, music, and dance events, and through our connections in Alaska and nationally, we feel we will be able to overcome the difficulties of organizing a festival on short notice. <br/></p>

Todos respiramos, todos amamos, todos comemos, todos creamos. En toda cultura hay agricultores, constructores, sanadores, MÚSICOS. Este último, nuestro oficio, es desde donde queremos profundizar y emprender la búsqueda de una esencia común, que permita la comunicación mas allá de los idiomas, diferencias culturales y distancias geográficas. Tener la VOLUNTAD de acercarse.  ""Sonidos nómades"" es nuestra voluntad de acercarnos. </p><p><strong>¿Quiénes somos?</strong></p><p>Somos Ser o Dúo, un proyecto enfocado en la creación e interpretación de música instrumental que transita entre el mundo académico y popular, entre la improvisación y la escritura, entre lo local y lo global. Nos presentamos: <strong>Tomás Carrasco</strong> en instrumentos de viento de diversos orígenes (quena, flauta traversa, bansuri, kaval búlgaro, ney turco, entre otros) y <strong>Moa Edmunds</strong> en la guitarra, ambos somos jóvenes músicos profesionales de Valparaíso, Chile, con una vasta experiencia presentando nuestros trabajos en conciertos y festivales en nuestro país y en otros como Argentina, Colombia, Bolivia, Paraguay, Francia, Alemania, Turquía y Bulgaria. Además, nos desempeñamos como profesores, gestores, compositores e intérpretes comprometidos con la escena musical local. En este respecto, somos miembros fundadores del Colectivo ""La Grieta"", organizadores del Festival Internacional de Música ""A ras de cielo"", que ya cuenta con 3 versiones realizadas.</p><p>Conoce un poco de nuestra música:</p><p>- ""Aire de libra"" <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQmhZ_fS98M"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQmhZ_fS98M</a></p><p>- ""Quirquincho"" con Jonatan Szer <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AoJwswKjbQ&amp;t=3s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AoJwswKjbQ&amp;amp...</a></p><p>- ""El mar en el río"" <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRMfyRpHfE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRMfyRpHfE</a></p><p><strong>¿Cómo nació ""Sonidos Nómades""?</strong></p><p>Todo esto comienza a partir de un viaje que realizó Tomás el año 2015, estudiando instrumentos y compartiendo músicas y cotidianidades de otras culturas del mundo: en Bulgaria estudió el kaval búlgaro, en Turquía el ney turco y en España el Shakuhachi japonés.  A nivel personal, esta fue una experiencia que lo enriqueció tremendamente, despertando  en él la convicción de que la música tiene el poder de acercar. </p><p>A partir de esta experiencia y del trabajo colaborativo que viene realizando con Moa en diversos proyectos, nace ""Sonidos Nómades"".</p><p><strong>Este es el plan:</strong></p><p>Previo al viaje, adquiriremos el equipamiento técnico necesario para el registro audiovisual (cámaras, grabadora de audio y accesorios afines), para lo cual nos asesoraremos con la productora Transeúnte Films (<a href=""http://www.vimeo.com/260415309"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.vimeo.com/260415309</a>), quienes serán, además, los encargados de la posproducción del documental. </p><p>Nos reuniremos en Mumbai, India, en mayo de 2019 para dar inicio a este viaje. La ruta estará definida por dos ejes: el primero es documentar el encuentro con músicos ya comprometidos con nuestro proyecto: Shubam Modi y Anubhab Singh en India, Hamid Behrouzinia en Irán, Fulya Özlem en Turquía y Nikolay Doctorov con Damian Yordanov en Bulgaria (ver video de presentación).  Como segundo eje,  estaremos abiertos a las colaboraciones que vayan surgiendo durante el viaje, producto de nuevos contactos y lugares visitados. De esta forma, iremos paso a paso aunando diversas voluntades de acercarse. </p><p>Esta modalidad de trabajo nos otorga mucha flexibilidad y oportunidades, como también riesgos y desafíos. </p><p><strong>¿Para qué se utilizarán los aportes?</strong></p><p>El dinero reunido será utilizado para:</p><p>- Comprar equipo audiovisual: cámaras de video, micrófonos, trípodes...todo el equipo necesario para filmar un documental de buena calidad. Para esto, tenemos considerada una inversión de $4000 dólares</p><p>- Financiar parte de los costos del viaje: estimamos que estaremos en ruta mínimo un año. ¡Eso es mucho tiempo! Con su ayuda, podremos mantenernos y movilizarnos con mayor efectividad en y entre cada lugar que visitemos.  Para esto, consideramos sumar a nuestros fondos ya existentes una cantidad de $4000 dólares. </p><p>- Costos de posproducción: la magia no está sólo en registrar, sino que también en el arte de  ordenar y presentar esos registros, creando así una propuesta estética atractiva e impactante. De este trabajo se encargará la productora Transeúnte Films, quienes tienen una larga trayectoria en torno al cine documental.

We think that the best way of knowing something or someone is sharing, recognizing the things that unite us over those that divide us. Our project consists in the creation of a documentary about our journey and the encounter with musicians from distant land´s cultures, traveling from India to Bulgaria (so far).</p><p>The money that we will raise will be used for buying audiovisual equipment, financing travel expenses and postproduction costs.</p><p>Join us!</p><p><strong>- Why realice “Nomadic Sounds”?</strong></p><p>In a social context where difference, segregation, easy prejudice and, therefore, distrust are emphasized,  it turns urgent for us to get closer, to value those elements which, as human race, unit us. </p><p>We all breathe, love, eat, create. In every culture there are farmers, constructors, healers, MUSICIANS. This last one, our craft, is from where we want to deepen and start looking for a common essence, that allows communication beyond idioms, cultural differences and geographical distances. Having the WILL to get closer.</p><p>“Nomadic sounds” is our will to get closer.</p><p><strong>- Who are we?</strong></p><p>We are Ser o Dúo, a musical project focused on creation and interpretation of instrumental music, which goes between the academic and the popular worlds, between writing and improvisation, between global and local music. We present ourselves: <strong>Tomás Carrasco</strong>, playing many flutes from diverse origins (quenas, silver flute, bansuri, bulgarian kaval, turkish ney, among others) and<strong> Moa Edmunds</strong>, who plays the guitar. Based in Valparaíso, Chile, we have vast experience presenting our work in concerts and festivals in Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, Colombia, Germany, Spain, France, Turkey and Bulgaria. We work also as teachers, cultural promoters, composers and music performers fully committed to the local scene. We are founders of “La Grieta” collective, with whom we organize “A Ras de Cielo” International Music Festival (this will be the 4th year), and many other cultural instances. </p><p><strong>-How was “Nomadic sounds” born?</strong></p><p>This began with a journey that Tomás made back in 2015, studying instruments and sharing music and everydayness from other world cultures: in Bulgaria he studied the bulgarian kaval, in Turkey the turkish ney and in Spain the japanese Shakuhachi. In a personal level, this was a very enriching experience, and gave him the conviction that music has the power to bring closer people and cultures.</p><p>Starting from this experience, and from the collaborative work with Moa in diverse projects, “Nomadic sounds” is born.</p><p><strong>- This is the plan:</strong></p><p>Before the journey, we will acquire the necessary technical equipment for audiovisual recording (cameras, sound recorder and accessories), for which we will be advised by the producers Transeúnte films (<a href=""https://vimeo.com/260415309"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/260415309</a>). They are also who will make the work of postproduction for the documentary.</p><p>We will start this journey in Mumbai, India, in May of 2019. The route will be traced by 2 axis: the first we is to meet and record the encounters with musicians that we have already met and that are committed to the project: Shubam Modi y Anubhab Singh in India, Hamid Behrouzinia in Iran, Fulya Özlem en Turkey y Nikolay Doctorov with Damian Yordanov in Bulgaria (watch the presentation video). Also, we will be open to collaborate and share with people that we will meet on the road, because of new contacts and places that we visit. In this way, we will gather, step by step, multiple wills of getting closer and sharing.</p><p><strong>- How will the money be spent?</strong></p><p>The money that we raise will be used for:</p><ul>
<li>Buying audiovisual equipment: video cameras, microphones and everything we need for shooting a good quality documentary. For this, we consider an amount of $4000, plus the equipment we already have.</li>
<li>Finance part of our travel expenses: we think we will be traveling for at least 1 year: That is a lot of time! With your help, we will be able to live and mobilize in and between places with best comfort and effectiveness. We already have some money for this, but we need to raise $4000 more. </li>
<li>Postproduction costs: the magic is not only in registering, but in the art of arranging and presenting these registers, creating an attractive esthetic.

Todos respiramos, todos amamos, todos comemos, todos creamos. En toda cultura hay agricultores, constructores, sanadores, MÚSICOS. Este último, nuestro oficio, es desde donde queremos profundizar y emprender la búsqueda de una esencia común, que permita la comunicación mas allá de los idiomas, diferencias culturales y distancias geográficas. Tener la VOLUNTAD de acercarse.  ""Sonidos nómades"" es nuestra voluntad de acercarnos. ¿Quiénes somos?Somos Ser o Dúo, un proyecto enfocado en la creación e interpretación de música instrumental que transita entre el mundo académico y popular, entre la improvisación y la escritura, entre lo local y lo global. Nos presentamos: Tomás Carrasco en instrumentos de viento de diversos orígenes (quena, flauta traversa, bansuri, kaval búlgaro, ney turco, entre otros) y Moa Edmunds en la guitarra, ambos somos jóvenes músicos profesionales de Valparaíso, Chile, con una vasta experiencia presentando nuestros trabajos en conciertos y festivales en nuestro país y en otros como Argentina, Colombia, Bolivia, Paraguay, Francia, Alemania, Turquía y Bulgaria. Además, nos desempeñamos como profesores, gestores, compositores e intérpretes comprometidos con la escena musical local. En este respecto, somos miembros fundadores del Colectivo ""La Grieta"", organizadores del Festival Internacional de Música ""A ras de cielo"", que ya cuenta con 3 versiones realizadas.Conoce un poco de nuestra música:- ""Aire de libra"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQmhZ_fS98M- ""Quirquincho"" con Jonatan Szer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AoJwswKjbQ&amp...- ""El mar en el río"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VRMfyRpHfE¿Cómo nació ""Sonidos Nómades""?Todo esto comienza a partir de un viaje que realizó Tomás el año 2015, estudiando instrumentos y compartiendo músicas y cotidianidades de otras culturas del mundo: en Bulgaria estudió el kaval búlgaro, en Turquía el ney turco y en España el Shakuhachi japonés.  A nivel personal, esta fue una experiencia que lo enriqueció tremendamente, despertando  en él la convicción de que la música tiene el poder de acercar. A partir de esta experiencia y del trabajo colaborativo que viene realizando con Moa en diversos proyectos, nace ""Sonidos Nómades"".Este es el plan:Previo al viaje, adquiriremos el equipamiento técnico necesario para el registro audiovisual (cámaras, grabadora de audio y accesorios afines), para lo cual nos asesoraremos con la productora Transeúnte Films (www.vimeo.com/260415309), quienes serán, además, los encargados de la posproducción del documental. Nos reuniremos en Mumbai, India, en mayo de 2019 para dar inicio a este viaje. La ruta estará definida por dos ejes: el primero es documentar el encuentro con músicos ya comprometidos con nuestro proyecto: Shubam Modi y Anubhab Singh en India, Hamid Behrouzinia en Irán, Fulya Özlem en Turquía y Nikolay Doctorov con Damian Yordanov en Bulgaria (ver video de presentación).  Como segundo eje,  estaremos abiertos a las colaboraciones que vayan surgiendo durante el viaje, producto de nuevos contactos y lugares visitados. De esta forma, iremos paso a paso aunando diversas voluntades de acercarse. Esta modalidad de trabajo nos otorga mucha flexibilidad y oportunidades, como también riesgos y desafíos. ¿Para qué se utilizarán los aportes?El dinero reunido será utilizado para:- Comprar equipo audiovisual: cámaras de video, micrófonos, trípodes...todo el equipo necesario para filmar un documental de buena calidad. Para esto, tenemos considerada una inversión de $4000 dólares- Financiar parte de los costos del viaje: estimamos que estaremos en ruta mínimo un año. ¡Eso es mucho tiempo! Con su ayuda, podremos mantenernos y movilizarnos con mayor efectividad en y entre cada lugar que visitemos.  Para esto, consideramos sumar a nuestros fondos ya existentes una cantidad de $4000 dólares. - Costos de posproducción: la magia no está sólo en registrar, sino que también en el arte de  ordenar y presentar esos registros, creando así una propuesta estética atractiva e impactante. De este trabajo se encargará la productora Transeúnte Films, quienes tienen una larga trayectoria en torno al cine documental. Te invitamos a conocerlos en el siguiente link: www.vimeo.com/260415309. Este trabajo tiene un valor de $2000 dólares.Esto es Sonidos Nómades. Se parte de él ayudándonos a lograr nuestra meta y así poder llevar a tu pantalla nuestro viaje - documental.

We think that the best way of knowing something or someone is sharing, recognizing the things that unite us over those that divide us. Our project consists in the creation of a documentary about our journey and the encounter with musicians from distant land´s cultures, traveling from India to Bulgaria (so far).The money that we will raise will be used for buying audiovisual equipment, financing travel expenses and postproduction costs.Join us!- Why realice “Nomadic Sounds”?In a social context where difference, segregation, easy prejudice and, therefore, distrust are emphasized,  it turns urgent for us to get closer, to value those elements which, as human race, unit us. We all breathe, love, eat, create. In every culture there are farmers, constructors, healers, MUSICIANS. This last one, our craft, is from where we want to deepen and start looking for a common essence, that allows communication beyond idioms, cultural differences and geographical distances. Having the WILL to get closer.“Nomadic sounds” is our will to get closer.- Who are we?We are Ser o Dúo, a musical project focused on creation and interpretation of instrumental music, which goes between the academic and the popular worlds, between writing and improvisation, between global and local music. We present ourselves: Tomás Carrasco, playing many flutes from diverse origins (quenas, silver flute, bansuri, bulgarian kaval, turkish ney, among others) and Moa Edmunds, who plays the guitar. Based in Valparaíso, Chile, we have vast experience presenting our work in concerts and festivals in Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, Colombia, Germany, Spain, France, Turkey and Bulgaria. We work also as teachers, cultural promoters, composers and music performers fully committed to the local scene.

<p>I've had a long road in this amazing world of jazz. You never know where it will take you. Now, I'm beginning a new chapter and literally lending my voice to my story. I've been playing the trumpet for 40 years now and I had always told people that I was a backup singer....when I sang, people backed up! But now, life has shown me what these songs mean and I'm on a mission to extract the true meaning out of the Great American Songbook and put my own personal stamp on it. My experience as a trumpeter, arranger, composer and a teacher has kept me searching for the truth in music, authenticity and integrity.</p> </div><div>

En s'inspirant du courant populaire, folk et classique, voix et musique vous guiderons dans un monde profane et sacré, où les harmonies et les textes évoqués peignent de vives images.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello citizens of Earth! I am ROZEE. An Indie Recording Artist and Songwriter based in Los Angeles. Some of you know me, many of you may not. I am releasing my single ""DEJAVU"" on 6.29.18 and I need your help to film an EPIC Music Video! I need your Moooniiiess(Not a Typo).</p>
<p>Have you ever been fresh out of a relationship and everything you do reminds you of your past love? Well, thats exactly what DEJAVU is about. It's about that nostalgic feeling you get when you roll to the right side of the bed only to realize that there's no one there. It's about the sinking feeling in your chest every time you think about them being gone. Love and Heartache are such powerful emotions so I want to tell this story with and amazing visual.</p>
<p>I am releasing this song and also working on completing my First STUDIO ALBUM and let me tell ya... It's ALOT of work, but I wouldn't want to be doing anything else.</p>
<p>I've got a great film production team behind me (see ""Blue Sky"" music video) and I want them to have everything they need to create a great music video.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I started this professional journey in the music industry about 4 years ago. Many of you know that I've been singing since childhood. I'm the Daughter of a Minister and a Musician, so music is in my blood. Even though I've lost both of my parents, their music lives on in me.</p>
<p>I'll always remember how I felt when I first heard Sade Adu on the radio. Her music was so intriguing, and to this day I still get that feeling of nostalgia whenever I hear her. I always blast the radio! That's the impact I'd like my music to have on the world. I understand the value of timeless music. Music is a universal language because there is no other language the can express the things that we think and feel so perfectly. Think about it. There is literally a song for everything; from ABC's till Death do us part.</p>
<p>With your help, I can reach audiences around the world. More chances for more people to relate to something they may be experiencing. More chances for healing. ""Blue Sky"" was my first  visual release and in all honesty, it did 'ok'. I say ok, because as amazing as it was, I did not have the resources available to push the song the way I would have liked to. I don't have a label, or an angel investor backing me; this is all out of pocket. A lot goes into making a successful record. So I don't just Want your Contribution, I NEED it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Over the years, I've had a Love/Hate relationship with this industry. I even walked away from music when I first moved to LA. But at the end of it all, I love making music that people can connect with. I've been fortunate enough to meet with and work with very talented creatives. We are all working artists and have to make a living. Many of us just want to make a comfortable living while doing the thing we love most. I work two jobs just to make a living while continuing to make music. It takes a lot of courage and strength to persevere in this cutthroat industry. I've heard it all and yet still I'm here with my hater blockers on, staying on course.</p>
</div><div>

<h4 style=""text-align:center;"">About Me</h4>
<p>I come from a Cretan family that has a long music history, my grandfather played the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretan_lyra"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cretan lyra</a>, my father the lute, and all my uncles are either professional folk musicians or played some Greek folk music instrument. I, however, got involved mostly with the classical studies of music, first learning the piano and after some years I realized that I was more interested in composition being inspired by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Mahler, Stravinsky, and others. Beethoven, Chopin and Mahler are the ones that have infuenced me the most. Being very interested in metaphysics I consider and use music as a means for meditation and relaxation and so over time I have worked on several projects involving meditation music and poetry which you can see below, in the ""samples of my other projects"".</p>

<p><br/>The ""Seven Piano Nocturnes"" is a set of seven music pieces for Piano that sound more as <i>Reveries</i> and <i>Meditations</i> than following the ""Nocturne"" form as developed by John Field and Frédéric Chopin. I consider them as nocturnal pieces for relaxation and meditation.</p>
<p>The composition of the Nocturnes is almost completed and the score of three of them, and now I need the time for putting everything together so that the project gets completed in its entirety. They are listed below with their approximate duration, as they might change since they are still in development.</p>

<p>This work in progress needs you and your support!... You can choose to support this project by offering any amount of money you are able to contribute or by choosing a perk. There are many perks to choose from: You can get from the music album to even have a nocturne composed just for you, and many combination choices in between.</p>
<div style=""text-align:center;margin-top:15px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525873255/kh2c6yby4m1gzeomp0ws.png"" src="""" style=""width:600px;""/></div>
<p><b><u>Note</u></b>: Most perks are provided in digital format mostly because of consideration for the environment. For example, CD's nowadays are in rare use and people listen to music mostly thru their mobile phones or other digital means. The Score in digital format (PDF) can easily be printed on a regular (A4) page or larger if necessary, or it can be viewed using a tablet which I would recommend if possible.</p>

</div> </div></div>","About Me
I come from a Cretan family that has a long music history, my grandfather played the Cretan lyra, my father the lute, and all my uncles are either professional folk musicians or played some Greek folk music instrument. I, however, got involved mostly with the classical studies of music, first learning the piano and after some years I realized that I was more interested in composition being inspired by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Mahler, Stravinsky, and others. Beethoven, Chopin and Mahler are the ones that have infuenced me the most. Being very interested in metaphysics I consider and use music as a means for meditation and relaxation and so over time I have worked on several projects involving meditation music and poetry which you can see below, in the ""samples of my other projects"".
 
Music tradition of my Cretan family










 






The ""Seven Piano Nocturnes"" is a set of seven music pieces for Piano that sound more as Reveries and Meditations than following the ""Nocturne"" form as developed by John Field and Frédéric Chopin. I consider them as nocturnal pieces for relaxation and meditation.
The composition of the Nocturnes is almost completed and the score of three of them, and now I need the time for putting everything together so that the project gets completed in its entirety. They are listed below with their approximate duration, as they might change since they are still in development.
Nocturne no.1 - Reverie ................... ~ 4:21Nocturne no.2 - Meditation ................ ~ 7:25Nocturne no.3 - Anamniseis / Reverie ...... ~ 5:38Nocturne no.4 - Reverie ................... ~ 7:47Nocturne no.5 - Meditation ................ ~ 7:17Nocturne no.6 - Meditation ................ ~ 8:10Nocturne no.7 - Reverie ................... ~ 4:07
Your financial support will give me the opportunity to concentrate more on finishing the music, score, and production of the ""Seven Piano Nocturnes"". So, your financial assistance will greatly help the progress of this project and its final completion the best way possible ...
The goal of $3710 will go towards covering expenses of the various aspects of this project, such as, performance, studio expenses (such as, recording & mastering), score publishing, promotion, copyright registration, etc. More details below:

Performance: ................ $1200Studio: .....................  $900Score publishing: ........... $1150Promotion & other expenses:    $460---------                     -----Total: ...................... $3710





Score

The complete sheet music of all seven nocturnes will be produced and be available bound in one book. If you want you will also be able to get only three (3) nocturnes (1st, 3rd & 7th), by choosing the appropriate perk. You have also the choice to get the digital version of the Score along with the music album and the accompanying booklet, or have the printed score mailed to you.
If you choose to be a ""Sponsor"" you will get the printed score and your name will be mentioned in the score along with my deep appreciation. The primary Sponsors will get an Autographed Score!
Below is the entire score of the 3rd Nocturne ...




Perks
This work in progress needs you and your support!... You can choose to support this project by offering any amount of money you are able to contribute or by choosing a perk. There are many perks to choose from: You can get from the music album to even have a nocturne composed just for you, and many combination choices in between.

Note: Most perks are provided in digital format mostly because of consideration for the environment. For example, CD's nowadays are in rare use and people listen to music mostly thru their mobile phones or other digital means. The Score in digital format (PDF) can easily be printed on a regular (A4) page or larger if necessary, or it can be viewed using a tablet which I would recommend if possible.



Copyright
Initially the ""Seven Piano Nocturnes"" will be released under a 'Creative Commons' license. This means, the Music and the Score can be freely shared, but not commercially without a permission. I plan, in the future, to release both Music and Score in the public domain. For the time being this work will be under the following 'Creative Commons' license:
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 InternationalCC BY-NC-SA 4.0




Timetable
The composition of the Nocturnes is almost completed and the score of three of them. I plan the main body of the project to be ready and available by October 2018. The especially composed music is planned to be available by November. The Sponsors will be able to get the digital copies of the Music & Score a month earlier, on September 2018!
This is my first crowdfunding campaign and I hope I won't face many unexpected difficulties but I'll keep you updated anyway.

<h3>Sparrow and the Dirty Kids</h3>
<p>Sparrow and the Dirty Kids is a music project from Nathan Dickerson inspired by the sounds of joy and inclusion. Inclusion of one life into another. Of friends who carry each other wherever they go. But ultimately by the sounds of a good Papa who delights in us and who through the person of Jesus has revealed our true origin, our true home and our true belonging. The family of God.</p>
<p>​We carry these songs in our hearts as we travel down our unique paths of life, releasing light and love along a journey of 1,000 roads.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Needs and Perks</h3>
<p>The Needs:</p>
<ul><li>We need about $10,000 to finish off this project. The album is more than halfway complete but still needs a lot of attention. This will require another trip to Florida which will need flights, hotel, car and many more expenses including all the post production costs. </li></ul>
<p>The Perks:</p>
<ul><li>Other than the obvious once in a lifetime experience of launching this project with me, there are many perks to choose from that include things like merch, and even some private(online) songwriting courses(2). For those who are already in love with my music that you've heard and you want me to come to your church or gathering and bring the atmosphere of heaven, there are special perks for you too! </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>These songs have come from a deep place in my heart from intimacy with the Father. I truly believe that this will hit home for you in a fresh way and my hope is that you would encounter Jesus through these songs. <br/><br/>This project is also important to me because of the other platform I have in my life, and that is one that consists of kids who have lived on the streets the majority of their life in Nicaragua. I'm currently training at an MMA gym to be a boxer, and plan on taking boxing down to Nica to open a youth/rehab center. This project is connected because whatever profit I make from this album and more to come, directly helps to support me on this journey of social justice for the children of the world!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risky Business</h3>
<p>Our biggest risk is getting the album finished up in a timely manner that allows us to reach our goal of a releasing the EP by April of 2019. Monetary gain can help with this challenge of getting it wrapped up and ready to launch by then. <br/><br/>Another obstacle would be having the crew be able to go on tour together and it not just be Sparrow(Nate Dickerson). There is nothing wrong with this but of course we would love to take the whole crew on tour! Again, money could be an advantage  to this challenge and each purchase and pre-order will help us accomplish this desire. Also, if you'd like us to come to your church or gathering, please do not hesitate to reach out to us and to purchase the tour package that will be available!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Share the Love</h3>
<p>If you are able at this moment to pre-purchase the EP or any merchandise, there will be plenty of opportunity to do so at a later date. But it costs nothing to share this fundraiser and help spread the word about Sparrow and the Dirty Kids! The more you talk about us to your friends, play us on Spotify when the album drops, blast us in your car the more people will know about us and want to purchase our album and bring us in to worship Jesus with them!</p>
<h3><strong>BIG THANKS</strong></h3>
<p>Special shout out to Chris Lee for shooting the video and Cynthia Massey Herms for the photos! And Andres Mejia for being an amazing, patient producer! And Emily Shilts for my soon coming artwork and logo, and Brian Shilts for all his encouragement and tips! And Matt Spinks for believing in me even when I don't! Love you guys so much! And the biggest thanks to Zach Pratt! Without your love and support man I wouldn't even be as close to the finish line as I am with the first of many albums!</p>
<p>And of course YOU! We appreciate your support and love on every level. Each and everyone of you is precious on our sight!<br/><br/>Love,<br/>Sparrow and the Dirty Kids</p>

</p><p>My name is Peggy Stern, and since its inception, I have been the Artistic Director of the Ritenuto Foundation, a 501 c 3 organization dedicated to the presentation of fine music.</p><p>For 12 consecutive years we have presented The Wall Street Jazz Festival ""where the traditions meet the progressives, and all the leaders are women"". This is a free outdoor event held in lovely Uptown Kingston, NY. The Festival is held each year on Labor Day weekend. This year it will be held on August 29th.</p>
<p>The Festival was founded in 2004, with the principle of women-led ensembles. It differs from being a women’s festival, in that the women are free to choose their own personnel; simply said, the bandleaders are in charge of the music they present.</p>
<p>The presentations have been elegant and professional, but the environment has been intimate enough to be very personal. We intend to keep that hometown flavor; it works in our favor to see neighbors enjoying this world-class music for free. We are also drawing an audience from beyond our borders, from Albany to NYC.We have been growing each year; people stream into the street of our festival all evening; estimates of numbers are well beyond 2000 at this point. </p>
<p>The Festival has developed into a very precious community event, very beloved. We are particularly proud of the level of music we are presenting, and consider it a great gift to the community ( and a free one at that!) However, it costs a great deal of money to continue to produce this yearly event, which is why we are asking for your help this coming year, 2015.</p>
<p>We are very unusual in presenting the works of female composers year after year, and have made our reputation for the past eleven seasons on this fact.

This is a free outdoor event held in lovely Uptown Kingston, NY. The Festival is held each year on Labor Day weekend. This year it will be held on August 29th.
The Festival was founded in 2004, with the principle of women-led ensembles. It differs from being a women’s festival, in that the women are free to choose their own personnel; simply said, the bandleaders are in charge of the music they present.
The presentations have been elegant and professional, but the environment has been intimate enough to be very personal. We intend to keep that hometown flavor; it works in our favor to see neighbors enjoying this world-class music for free. We are also drawing an audience from beyond our borders, from Albany to NYC.We have been growing each year; people stream into the street of our festival all evening; estimates of numbers are well beyond 2000 at this point. 
The Festival has developed into a very precious community event, very beloved. We are particularly proud of the level of music we are presenting, and consider it a great gift to the community ( and a free one at that!) However, it costs a great deal of money to continue to produce this yearly event, which is why we are asking for your help this coming year, 2015.
We are very unusual in presenting the works of female composers year after year, and have made our reputation for the past eleven seasons on this fact. The past and present leaders of the bands, who have experienced our festival and concept firsthand, include Ingrid Jensen, ""Sweet"" Sue Terry, Jay Clayton, Dena Derose, Teri Roiger, to name a few. We invite you to peruse our website, http://wallstreetjazzfestival.com for more information.

The deets

 There are different levels of radio airplay. I look at it like applying to collges. Here is the breakdown:   $1,800 will fund a college radio campaign. (Remember your ""safety"" schools?) $4,650 will fund a college radio campaign and a triple A radio campaign.  Triple A is where many artists like Adele create career foundations. (Good fit). $11,650 will fund a College radio, Triple A, and Commercial Campaign..think Disney and XM Sirus Radio. (My reach goal).    The Impact 
The more people that know about my music and the kick-booty community around it...the more people it can positively impact! 
 Imagine, you are a teenage girl, going through a rough patch and feeling lonely. All of a sudden you hear this new song on the radio. It's an artist you've never heard of and when you google them, you find a  new community of people who love music, love supporting each other, and love learning ways to live happier, healthier lives! **Can I get a woot woot?!**

Al began to follow us which led to four category nominations and two category awards. In addition, the Hollywood Music in Media Awards recognized my song ""Out of Tune Guitar"" as Americana Song of the Year.

<p>I have been lucky enough to travel the world with my music and with this record i believe i will be able to do more of the same, but on a larger scale. I will also be able to go the places that need inspiration, and show them what can be achieved if you believe in something.</p>

I've always wanted to make a record that expresses those roots of where I come from. Returning to those roots and exploring those influences with a sound that brings together the integrity of punk and the honest storytelling of <strong>Americana Country Music</strong>. I moved to Nashville in 2017 to explore these roots and met some amazing friends and musicians!

Este contaba con 11 canciones, de las cuales 5 fueron inéditas y escritas pensando en suplir de nuevos himnos contemporáneos a la Iglesia hispanohablante.Con tu contribución a este proyecto, nuestro segundo álbum, podremos continuar impactando a iglesias de habla hispana en todo el mundo con contenido bíblico de alta calidad.Lo que necesitamosPara este proyecto, que consiste en la grabación en vivo de nuestro segundo álbum y todos los costos que eso supone, nuestro objetivo de recaudación de fondos es de US$17,300. Este monto incluye:
Costos de grabación de audio y video en vivo.
Costos de postproducción de audio y video.
Honorarios de equipo técnico que no es voluntario.
Logística y transporte de la banda.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am Fraya Thomsen, a composer from the Highlands of Scotland who grew up in the world of Gaelic music. Over the last four and a half years I have enjoyed applying this musical background to composing for film, which I studied an MA in at the National Film and TV School. I play the harp and sing and have performed and taught at festivals all over the world, most notably in a duo called The Duplets. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492706803/cijqsqnjywnwbxnnle64.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</li>
<li>I have won awards for my film composing and my compositions for harp are included in both the Trinity and Scottish grade exam syllabus'. </li>
<li>Here is a link to my film music showreel: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/151828528"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/151828528</a>

<li><p>Exploring themes of interconnectivity, youthful idealism/clarity, empowerment and communication has been incredibly rewarding for me, and I would love to think that perhaps Community and Stardust can be empowering to those who hear it. Here is a solo version of For The Water Protectors, and theme I composed for Community and Stardust: </p></li>

<li><p style=""text-align: center;"">I was delighted to appear live on BBC Radio 2 The Arts Show with Jonathan Ross, who I am grateful to for encouraging me to create a crowd fundraising campaign for this project. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492707301/bndzaedliawxkzjbopfc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></li>

<li><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Musical recording quality is dependant on a number of factors, which money CAN buy. </span></font></li>
</ul>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">​It is really </span>important<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to me to spend significant time in pre production with a producer and engineer as well as rehearsing with the musicians thoroughly</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. </span></font></p>
<p><font>Room shape, sound isolation and the quality of equipment such as pre amps and microphones also play a large part in determining the quality of a recording. </font></p>
<p>These days it is really hard to find financial support with which to make studio albums due to a number of factors including the impact of digital downloading, so your contribution is likely to facilitate something which would be unachievable without you. Completing an album of this music will enable me to share it in such a widespread way that is just not possible otherwise. I will send it to numerous radio stations and podcasters as well as using it to approach concert bookers with. CD sales will also be a great financial contribution towards the costs of performing with the whole line up which is of great importance if we are to perform at the niche music venues and festivals that we the band all know and love. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break down:</p>
<ul>
<li>To record and produce this music I will work with a number of highly skilled collaborators who will all need to be paid professional rates for their time and expertise. These will include:</li>
<li>Musicians</li>
<li>Producer</li>
<li>Engineer</li>
<li>Studio Hire</li>
<li>Publicist</li>
<li>Artwork</li>
<li>CD Duplication</li>
<li>Indegogo / Banking Fees = 10%</li>
<li>Postage and overheads of award packages for sponsors.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>REWARDS! </strong></li>
<li>We appreciate everyones contributions greatly and have created a number of different award packages that we hope will be appealing. </li>
<li>
<strong>​</strong>Everyone<strong> </strong>who sponsors this project will have their name included in the CD artwork becoming a part of the Stardust community as we gather momentum. </li>
<li>Please see more options in the PERKS section. </li>
<li><strong>FLEXIBILITY</strong></li>
<li>If we reach or even exceed our stated financial goal we will be able to make a high quality product which we can all be proud of. If there are any funds left over we will use these to facilitate an album launch tour. </li>
<li>If we do not reach our stated goal, I will continue my work towards producing, manufacturing and distributing the album none the less. I may have to make compromises in terms of which recording facility I use, and how many rehearsals/pre production meetings I have in advance of the recording process. It will take longer to make the album and there may be longer gaps in between the various stages of the process whilst I raise capital in every way I can, but it will be made!</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3><strong>Inspiration Behind the Music</strong></h3>
<ul><li><strong>Connectivity:</strong></li></ul>
<p>'We are connected' - a lyric from Community and Stardust, is one of the most crucial things that I have grown to understand in the last year or more. In a sense Community and Stardust aims to be a musical equivalent of the Metta Bhavana practice where, in meditation, Buddhists wish health, happiness and progression for themselves and others on both a personal and universal level. I have aimed for my piece to balance beauty and optimism with the confrontation of some unapologetically socio political lyrics. </p>
<ul><li><strong>Youthful clarity and Idealism:</strong></li></ul>
<p>I love the fact that when you ask a child what they would like to change about the world they will usually come up with something huge like 'stop all hunger' and another I worked with recently when asked what thing she thinks everyone deserves to have in their lives said 'peace"". </p>
<p>I decided to rebel against the idea a friend proposed to me during development that it is immature to be upset about all injustice. Frankly I think most injustice is connected and usually a consequence of greed. So why should I focus on just one area? In the UK we are starting to try to change the fact that many voices are under represented in the media and the arts, and I believe that this message is one of value, hence the lyric 'All I want to do is save the world' meant as a celebration of simple, holistic values. </p>
<ul><li><strong>Empowerment:</strong></li></ul>
<p>There have been times in history where there was a cultural move towards optimism and equality, and there have been times in history when revolutions have been largely identified by the music that accompanied them. Billy Bragg, a song writer who I hold in very high esteem, said at a festival in the north of Scotland that cynicism is the greatest threat to justice and equality. This wonderful observation has guided my approach to my own life as well as my approach to composing Community and Stardust. I aim to empower the audience by blowing away the residual cobwebs of negativity gathered through the experience of financial struggle, politicians speeches, constant advertising and consumerism, and survival of the fittest attitudes which disable us from enjoying each other's success. It is too easy to feel defeated, and so I have explored this feeling, given it a melody and I hope that in my honesty I can allow others to recognise and shed cynicism or defeatism if that is useful for them.   <strong> </strong></p>
<p>​Here is a solo version of one of the songs in Community and Stardust:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbLWxKZJRV0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbLWxKZJRV0</a></p>
<ul><li><strong>Communication and Improvising:</strong></li></ul>
<p>Communal music making is a wordless from of communication, and I feel this channel of communication is vastly heightened when improvisation is introduced. It was really important to me to create structures within which the Community and Stardust musicians could improvise facilitating each musician to share an expression of themselves through their instrument. The energy that this style of communal music making generates is exciting and palpable and is a valuable gift to share both for the makers and the beholders. There is a marked difference in the journey of a pre composed structured melody and musical improvisation which appears much more as a stream of consciousness. I hope that in celebrating the individuals and their consciousness, we can encourage individuality and a joy in communication. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>One of the great values of this project is that the group of musicians who have engaged in it are all world renowned musicians and represent a number of different genres. Their energy, enthusiasm and understanding of the piece is tangible in the way they play, rehearse and discuss it. Our rehearsal process thus far has been very special as I have deliberately worked with musicians that I hadn't worked with before. The journey of learning each others varied strengths has produced a warm and exciting energy in the group. This, alongside a number of structures devised for improvising brings a communication and spontaneity which really allows us to share and communicate the theme of interconnection which the piece is based on. </li>
<li>I have been involved in the making and distribution of a number of independent albums over the years most notably The Duplets' Tree of Strings and Leverage which both received airplay on a number of BBC radio programmes as well as being highlighted as album of the week and month in Radio Nan Gaidheal, Celtic Music Radio and Heartland FM. They both received numerous reviews such as: </li>

</div></div>","Short Summary

I am Fraya Thomsen, a composer from the Highlands of Scotland who grew up in the world of Gaelic music. Over the last four and a half years I have enjoyed applying this musical background to composing for film, which I studied an MA in at the National Film and TV School. I play the harp and sing and have performed and taught at festivals all over the world, most notably in a duo called The Duplets. 

I have won awards for my film composing and my compositions for harp are included in both the Trinity and Scottish grade exam syllabus'. 
Here is a link to my film music showreel: https://vimeo.com/151828528


I have a burning desire to record the music that I composed for Celtic Connections' at the highest quality I can afford because I believe it is beautiful and honest music which communicates an important sentiment, one that is relevant and empowering amidst todays atomised western societies. ​A recent review of our live concert asserted: 


""a musical and rhetorical triumph, a coherent argument beautifully structured"" David Francis-  TRACS

Exploring themes of interconnectivity, youthful idealism/clarity, empowerment and communication has been incredibly rewarding for me, and I would love to think that perhaps Community and Stardust can be empowering to those who hear it. Here is a solo version of For The Water Protectors, and theme I composed for Community and Stardust: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xryQMSauy34
I was delighted to appear live on BBC Radio 2 The Arts Show with Jonathan Ross, who I am grateful to for encouraging me to create a crowd fundraising campaign for this project. 
Here is a snippet of the interview and music we played on BBC Radio 2: https://soundcloud.com/fraya-thomsen/bbc-radio-2-arts-show-jonathan-ross-fraya-thomsen-and-heloise-werner
Musical recording quality is dependant on a number of factors, which money CAN buy. 

​It is really important to me to spend significant time in pre production with a producer and engineer as well as rehearsing with the musicians thoroughly. 
Room shape, sound isolation and the quality of equipment such as pre amps and microphones also play a large part in determining the quality of a recording. 
These days it is really hard to find financial support with which to make studio albums due to a number of factors including the impact of digital downloading, so your contribution is likely to facilitate something which would be unachievable without you. Completing an album of this music will enable me to share it in such a widespread way that is just not possible otherwise. I will send it to numerous radio stations and podcasters as well as using it to approach concert bookers with. CD sales will also be a great financial contribution towards the costs of performing with the whole line up which is of great importance if we are to perform at the niche music venues and festivals that we the band all know and love. 

What We Need & What You Get
Break down:

To record and produce this music I will work with a number of highly skilled collaborators who will all need to be paid professional rates for their time and expertise. These will include:
Musicians
Producer
Engineer
Studio Hire
Publicist
Artwork
CD Duplication
Indegogo / Banking Fees = 10%
Postage and overheads of award packages for sponsors.

 

REWARDS! 
We appreciate everyones contributions greatly and have created a number of different award packages that we hope will be appealing. 

​Everyone who sponsors this project will have their name included in the CD artwork becoming a part of the Stardust community as we gather momentum. 
Please see more options in the PERKS section. 
FLEXIBILITY
If we reach or even exceed our stated financial goal we will be able to make a high quality product which we can all be proud of. If there are any funds left over we will use these to facilitate an album launch tour. 
If we do not reach our stated goal, I will continue my work towards producing, manufacturing and distributing the album none the less. I may have to make compromises in terms of which recording facility I use, and how many rehearsals/pre production meetings I have in advance of the recording process. It will take longer to make the album and there may be longer gaps in between the various stages of the process whilst I raise capital in every way I can, but it will be made!


Inspiration Behind the Music
Connectivity:
'We are connected' - a lyric from Community and Stardust, is one of the most crucial things that I have grown to understand in the last year or more. In a sense Community and Stardust aims to be a musical equivalent of the Metta Bhavana practice where, in meditation, Buddhists wish health, happiness and progression for themselves and others on both a personal and universal level. I have aimed for my piece to balance beauty and optimism with the confrontation of some unapologetically socio political lyrics. 
Youthful clarity and Idealism:
I love the fact that when you ask a child what they would like to change about the world they will usually come up with something huge like 'stop all hunger' and another I worked with recently when asked what thing she thinks everyone deserves to have in their lives said 'peace"". 
I decided to rebel against the idea a friend proposed to me during development that it is immature to be upset about all injustice. Frankly I think most injustice is connected and usually a consequence of greed. So why should I focus on just one area? In the UK we are starting to try to change the fact that many voices are under represented in the media and the arts, and I believe that this message is one of value, hence the lyric 'All I want to do is save the world' meant as a celebration of simple, holistic values. 
Empowerment:
There have been times in history where there was a cultural move towards optimism and equality, and there have been times in history when revolutions have been largely identified by the music that accompanied them. Billy Bragg, a song writer who I hold in very high esteem, said at a festival in the north of Scotland that cynicism is the greatest threat to justice and equality. This wonderful observation has guided my approach to my own life as well as my approach to composing Community and Stardust. I aim to empower the audience by blowing away the residual cobwebs of negativity gathered through the experience of financial struggle, politicians speeches, constant advertising and consumerism, and survival of the fittest attitudes which disable us from enjoying each other's success. It is too easy to feel defeated, and so I have explored this feeling, given it a melody and I hope that in my honesty I can allow others to recognise and shed cynicism or defeatism if that is useful for them.    
​Here is a solo version of one of the songs in Community and Stardust:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbLWxKZJRV0
Communication and Improvising:
Communal music making is a wordless from of communication, and I feel this channel of communication is vastly heightened when improvisation is introduced. It was really important to me to create structures within which the Community and Stardust musicians could improvise facilitating each musician to share an expression of themselves through their instrument. The energy that this style of communal music making generates is exciting and palpable and is a valuable gift to share both for the makers and the beholders. There is a marked difference in the journey of a pre composed structured melody and musical improvisation which appears much more as a stream of consciousness. I hope that in celebrating the individuals and their consciousness, we can encourage individuality and a joy in communication. 

 

The Impact

One of the great values of this project is that the group of musicians who have engaged in it are all world renowned musicians and represent a number of different genres. Their energy, enthusiasm and understanding of the piece is tangible in the way they play, rehearse and discuss it. Our rehearsal process thus far has been very special as I have deliberately worked with musicians that I hadn't worked with before. The journey of learning each others varied strengths has produced a warm and exciting energy in the group. This, alongside a number of structures devised for improvising brings a communication and spontaneity which really allows us to share and communicate the theme of interconnection which the piece is based on. 
I have been involved in the making and distribution of a number of independent albums over the years most notably The Duplets' Tree of Strings and Leverage which both received airplay on a number of BBC radio programmes as well as being highlighted as album of the week and month in Radio Nan Gaidheal, Celtic Music Radio and Heartland FM. They both received numerous reviews such as:

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want to make it easier for people to develop that creative capacities that will serve them in all aspects of their lives. </p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you have a <strong>hidden creative passion</strong> you're not expressing. Perhaps you were told not to be artistic, to never sing, or to please not dance in public. Perhaps it was a teacher, a parent, a friend, a sibling who threw cold water on your dream. So life has never felt as full and exciting as you wanted. This project is for <strong>you... </strong><i>to live the life now that you have always been meant to live.</i>
</li>
<li>I know there are millions of people whose own creative juice has not yet come out. They need to hear our message and be inspired that they can <strong>reinvent themselves</strong> out of the limited version of themselves they have become. We will help so many people with this movement and the products that can inspire them.</li>
<li>Renaissance Human is creating a <strong>scholarship fund</strong> to make it possible for <strong>children and teens</strong> -- who have not had the <i>privilege</i> to be exposed to creative expression -- gain new skills and develop hidden talents. The first beneficiary will be <strong>Soul Shoppe</strong> of Oakland, CA, an innovative educational group teaching social and emotional learning skills to elementary age children throughout the Bay Area. </li>
<li>I have helped several innovative businesses grow into multi-million dollar enterprises that changed the world. I have developed courses in Creativity that are part of Stanford University's wellness program. I would like to see those courses reach nonprofits, NGOs, startups, and social enterprises of all kinds. </li>
<li>We're going to make this happen. I've lived my whole life to see it all come together... a <strong>legacy</strong> I am building for what humanity needs <i>today</i> and what future generations can benefit from in the <i>future</i>. <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503165732/pr8o2jjrb8rvj6qkxt7a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>

</div><p> </p></div>","Why This Campaign Matters
Renaissance Human is a new movement to activate the creative spark that lies within each human being.
In our techno-frantic lives filled with daunting problems and civilization-threatening crises, it can be hard to hear, let alone activate, that creative voice inside us. The voice that wants to be heard in a world that needs our heart, our care, our compassion, and our ideas.

 
So I want to change that and will be using every ounce of creativity I can muster for that mission.
And I need your help.
I'm Bruce Cryer, founder of the RenaissanceHuman Project, and leader of an exceptional team of people helping me create an album of original songs, a documentary film, and a series of launch events around the US. My career has spanned diverse fields from the arts and business, starting with being an singer/dancer/actor on Broadway, publisher, health care executive, author, leadership consultant, CEO of several companies, mentor, and photographer.

Here's why I'm building a movement, with your help:

I had a series of life-threatening conditions between 2009 and 2011 that awakened me to the need to express myself creatively once again. When I started sharing my story I realized that many, many other people had the same need I had.
I feel a deep desire to help children and adults activate the creative spark inside themselves. I believe the world needs new creativity at a time of tremendous peril and animosity.

As individuals we need to express the fullness of who we are in order to lead the most satisfying lives possible.
With my social media networks alone we will reach hundreds of thousands of people all over the world with this campaign. People of all generations, nationalities, religions, economic and educational backgrounds. We can inspire hope and possibility to millions.  


How We Can Benefit Together
Our goal is to raise $25,000 to help fund the completion of an album of original songs (written and performed by me and my collaborators, Isaac Koren, Thorald Koren and Gary Malkin) -- to be released October 2017; a documentary film created by the talented duo, Maya Pisciotto and Fabian Aguirre of The Understory; Creativity Programs for Underprivileged Youth and Adults; and a series of launch events currently planned for LA, San Francisco, and New York City in Fall / Winter 2017, and a variety of perks, products and programs that are being created. 


Funding needs are split roughly 50-30-10-10 between album completion and mastering, documentary creation, creativity programs creation, launch events, and merchandise creation such as CDs, art prints, t-shirts, etc. 
Our perks cover the gamut -- including signed copies of the CD, limited edition art print, Renaissance Human logo t-shirts, set of 10 of my Nature photographs with special quotes, a private Creativity Mentoring session with me, Creativity Immersion Experiences @Home, and Creativity Experiences @Work, and Patron status which will be identified on the album, documentary and launch events. And many more! Including our $1 perk for the single of the new song ""Bless the Children"". You can dedicate that purchase to your favorite school!

The satisfaction you'll have from contributing to the creation of a movement to help so many others activate their creative sparks will be tremendous.


 
The Impact
I want to make it easier for people to develop that creative capacities that will serve them in all aspects of their lives. 

Perhaps you have a hidden creative passion you're not expressing. Perhaps you were told not to be artistic, to never sing, or to please not dance in public. Perhaps it was a teacher, a parent, a friend, a sibling who threw cold water on your dream. So life has never felt as full and exciting as you wanted. This project is for you... to live the life now that you have always been meant to live.

I know there are millions of people whose own creative juice has not yet come out. They need to hear our message and be inspired that they can reinvent themselves out of the limited version of themselves they have become. We will help so many people with this movement and the products that can inspire them.
Renaissance Human is creating a scholarship fund to make it possible for children and teens -- who have not had the privilege to be exposed to creative expression -- gain new skills and develop hidden talents. The first beneficiary will be Soul Shoppe of Oakland, CA, an innovative educational group teaching social and emotional learning skills to elementary age children throughout the Bay Area. 
I have helped several innovative businesses grow into multi-million dollar enterprises that changed the world. I have developed courses in Creativity that are part of Stanford University's wellness program. I would like to see those courses reach nonprofits, NGOs, startups, and social enterprises of all kinds. 
We're going to make this happen. I've lived my whole life to see it all come together... a legacy I am building for what humanity needs today and what future generations can benefit from in the future.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our band consists of Scott Lubin (18) : the cliche lead singer with looks, Michael O'Hazo (16) : the show off guitarist with humor, and Ansh Jetly (18) : mainly everything else. We all met each other at Kent school and somehow got by school with our love, passion, and dedication to music as a band. Some of our favorite artists include Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pink Floyd, Maroon 5, Radiohead, Coldplay, ELO, Green Day, Muse, and Jan Terri (Ansh isn't a big fan of hers though.) The reason for our band name is because when our free block's lined up day to day at school, we'd devote that time to jamming out. We would never miss an opportunity to do just that. Now that we're out of school and have some time off, why not put everything on the line to make it big? That's what our summer 2017 is about.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So here's the low down. For this album to happen, we need your help big time. In September, Scott and Ansh are going off to their freshman year of college across the country so we'll all be split up. Long story short, this summer may be our only chance together to show the world what we can do as a band. What we need is to be able to pay for studio sessions, copyright our songs, promote our music, make more sick music videos like Stayed the Same, and get CD's. Every dollar would mean so much to us. Also keep in mind for those big contributors, perks will involve getting to hear new songs we're working on, having songs written specifically about you, and even getting to appear in our next music video! Not to mention if you live close enough, you could spend a day in the studio with us. If we don't reach our goal, no matter what, all the money that is made will be going to these causes (especially time in the studio!)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The sad reality is that there are an endless amount of bands that never made it and faded away. That's a hard  pill swallow.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who We Are</h3>
<p>The <strong>THEATRE BIZARRE ORCHESTRA</strong> is the house band for Detroit's annual <i><strong>Theatre Bizarre </strong></i>event. Rooted in Detroit's burlesque, rock &amp; roll, jazz, and vaudeville culture, the TBO are a band of musicians invoking the spirit of dark carnivals, demented circuses, and ribald debauchery, which can only be defined as neo-vaudeville. Their music is captivating and mesmerizing, and their show blends the etheral with the burlesque in one fell swoop. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Backstory</strong></h3>
<p>Their first album project, <i><strong>Carpe Noctem</strong></i>, garnered national attention for being a collaborative project with Bauhaus rocker <strong>David J</strong>. Emboldened by that success, the TBO sought to investigate the realms of <strong>burlesque</strong> and <strong>jazz </strong>through their newest project, <i><strong>Dance with the Devil</strong></i>--set to be released on Friday the 13th in October, 2017.</p>
<p>One magical April evening the band assembled within the walls of Detroit's historic <strong>Scarab Club</strong>. Amidst an intimate gathering of faithful followers the TBO sought to record an album of music <i><strong>dedicated to the burlesque arts in its entirety</strong></i>. What transpired was truly magical: a full-length album of original music, inspired by and for burlesque performers, known as <strong>""Dance with the Devil.""</strong> Pressed on limited edition vinyl, the music of that evening is sure to <i>quicken the pulse</i>, <i>inspire locomotion, </i>are conjure the <i><strong>devil himself!</strong></i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Endeavor</strong></h3>
<p>In support of this new album we’re taking our music to the very axis of burlesque and jazz music, New York and New Orleans! (With a stop at our <strong><i>favorite</i></strong> brewery, <strong>Founders Brewing Co.</strong> in Grand Rapids.) Our journey includes the following performances:</p>

<strong>$2500 will help us travel to New Orleans, New York City, and Grand Rapids </strong>: this will help defray the costs of travel, lodging, and instrumental rental. (You try transporting a Sousaphone across the country!)</li>

<h3>Dear Friends and Fans</h3>
<p><strong>I am Adam Elara,</strong> singer-songwriter from Houston, TX. I started playing music in a few different bands over the last few years. Every single project I have been a part of has been a valuable learning experience. I have always been able to make things happen on my own, so this is new for me. I appreciate all the support I have received throughout all the years from you. For the first time you can be a direct part of the new journey.</p>
<p>Over the past few months I've been able to secure good relationships with people in the industry that are willing to do quality work for me, but I have to honor their investment as well. Unfortunately I don't come from a rich family and work odd jobs to fit around my music schedule. That's why this campaign is so important, the accomplishment of my dreams is just around the corner and my only obstacle is money.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding will pay for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>6.5k Music Video</li>
<li>2k Production</li>
<li>2k Marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>The remainder helps out with artwork, photo shoots, overhead costs, perk fulfillment, etc</p>
<p>I have created some amazing perks as incentives for your investment, I thought very carefully would entice myself to contribute and I'm confident you will appreciate them!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By donating to this project you will be supporting the creation and dissemination of new, creative, original music. This is music that, as a whole, heals. It is cathartic. It is needed now, maybe as much as ever.</p>
<p>I am humbled to add my voice to this deeply important art form. I am even more humbled that you would consider supporting it. I believe this new record represents a progression and development of my artistic pursuits. Those of who have you seen me perform live know that I give my everything into the performance and it's never a dull moment on stage. I apply the same approach to my work ethic and will not waste a single penny of your contribution.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I'm well aware that this is one of the most difficult industries to break into and create a career out of. Growing up with traditional immigrant parents I have heard that the ""practical"" route is the only way to go. I've seen friends and family settle into their lives and have missed out on so many social life cues due to working tirelessly on musical projects. Through all the adversity, rejection, and negativity I've stayed on the path and kept going!</p>
<p>I have managed to seek out the best people to work with on this endeavor that have a track record of success to minimize the risk of failure this time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It would be very helpful if you would get the word out about this campaign and share it with friends/family on social media, word of mouth, etc.  You can utilize the Indiegogo ""share"" tools. Please make some noise about my efforts that I'm making on this new journey.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your time, help and consideration.</p>
<p>Deeply appreciated,</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello everyone and welcome to the ""Songs From The Mount"" campaign; a project that seeks to bring affirming worship songs to life; affirming, meaning it affirms and celebrates the worth, value, perspective, and righteousness of every walk of life, including all people from every race, sexual orientation, and gender identity. The inspiration behind this project stems from Jesus' sermon on the mount where he encourages his followers to walk with mercy, meekness, long-suffering, and a hunger to see all things transformed by love. Unfortunately, we live in a day where many of our faith spaces have lost sight of this precious calling, causing the deepest wounds and driving people away from community.  But I am a firm believer that holy spirit infused music heals, intentionally crafted music comforts, and affirming music convicts us of the truth of God's acceptance towards us.</p>
<p>I hope that you all have had the chance to check out my new single ""Defender's Hymn"".  It is the first in the series of songs that will be a part of this project.  Our team poured blood, sweat, time, tears, and lots of money into the creation of that song so I pray it blessed you beyond your wildest expectations.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>A Call To Partner</h3>
<p>With that being said, I really felt led to open up the project and let you all be a part of bringing the rest of the songs to life.   So many of you have reached out and told me how much affirming worship by queer people, for all people,  truly makes a difference in your spiritual journey.  I really want to press into this moment and pull on our beautiful community to fund this project and make this dream a reality.  </p>
<p>For the completion of the next visual song we are asking for $2500 to cover equipment, venue, recording, mixing, mastering, promoting, and release. That's $2500 to release the next sound of healing and hope from ""Songs From The Mount"". </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here are a few reasons why I believe this project is so massive in its impact.</p>
<ul>
<li>As it stands now, finding affirming worship music is very challenging as there are only a handful of artists creating this kind of music, and understandably so. We have for so long been told that we must choose to lie about our orientation or give up being a worshiper altogether.</li>
<li>Not only will this project affirm people from all backgrounds but it will also stand as a beacon to other worshippers, encouraging them not to give up on their passion and to continue expressing themselves in worship no matter what.</li>
<li>This project stands as a response to the conviction that we must be what our younger selves needed. We must show up and let this next generation know that they are not alone and that God is for them. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Now, I am generally an optimist but I realize that this project comes with its challenges.  Unfortunately, I am well aware of the erroneous theology of hate that continues to spur people to push back on our cause, but that just gives me more energy to see this project come to pass. Regardless of the challenges, I am confident in two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>God's divine support and leading.</li>
<li>Your encouragement, prayers, and giving.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I am so excited to go on this journey with you and I believe that this project will yield so much light and life. For those that can't give, you can support by helping to spread the word about this campaign. Let the world know about this beautiful gift that is ""Songs From The Mount"". </p>

<p>“Indie Artist Em Hoggett is earning rave reviews from some of the most prestigious critics in the music business.” – <a href=""http://www.thecmagazine.com/?p=5400"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The C Magazine  </a></p>
<p>My name is Em Hoggett, and I am a critically-acclaimed artist and classically trained pianist. My training as a classical pianist began at the age of 4 and continued through my childhood and teenage years, achieving my first degree (ATCL) at age 11, and my second (LTCL) at 15. I was fortunate to perform with world-renowned pianist <strong>Lang Lang</strong> at the Royal Festival Hall in London and at the Fazioli Concert Hall in Italy, among many other notable venues. At the age of 13 I discovered a new passion: songwriting. And songwriting has become the key to healing me through my darkest times.</p>
<p>At 16, I was stripped of my power, my strength, my sexuality, my ability to trust, my ability to love, my ability to live. I was raped. </p>
<p>But now, I am here to share my story of being <strong>REBORN</strong>. </p>
<p>I am fortunate enough to be working with an incredible team of musicians including <strong>Melvin Brannon Jr</strong> (Booker T, Dan Reed Network), <strong>Tyler Hammond</strong> (Fred Durst, Limp Bizkit), <strong>Fire Mist</strong> (Sea At Last) and GRAMMY-nominated <strong>Bruce Witkin</strong> (Aerosmith, Marilyn Manson, Alice Cooper).</p>
<p>In 2016, after years of suppressing the truth, I found the courage to tell the world what had happened to me, in the hope of processing my own experience as well as helping others through theirs. I released a song on social media about my experience and over the next two years wrote 3 more, all explicitly about different emotions that I felt after accepting that I had been raped. I had a whole EP worth of songs about my experience and I knew that they needed to be shared with the world. This July, <strong>What I Want To Say To You </strong>(WIWTSTY) was released, candidly and unapologetically expressing to the world the horrors of rape, and my own personal grief and struggle.</p>

<p>The world has heard me at my worst, my weakest, in my deepest pain.</p>
<p>Now, I am <strong>REBORN</strong>.</p>
<p>Over the past 3 years, I have regained my strength, my sexuality, my power, and my love of life. I want to show the world that no matter what you’ve been through, things can ALWAYS get better. I have felt the deepest depths of darkness, and I now find myself in moments of happiness, of power, and living a life that is led by love and strength. I want to share this with the world. </p>
<p>I went through hell and made it out the other side. I’m still fighting every day but I want to share with everyone my belief that we all hold within us the power to turn any situation around. I want listeners to come away from the album thinking, “I am strong. I do have power. I can live. I can LOVE.” For me, <strong>REBORN</strong> is the beginning of my path to freedom.</p>
<p>Inspired by artists such as Shirley Bassey and Jamie Cullum, the musical style of this album combines the sound of a James Bond soundtrack with the storytelling of a Pink Floyd album. Like a James Bond theme song, <strong>REBORN</strong> will be incredibly epic, dense, soulful, sensual... full of power. But, at the same time it will have it’s own artistic style, featuring elements of many genres including jazz and classical. </p>
<p>A Pink Floyd-inspired concept album, <strong>REBORN</strong> will tell a story from beginning to end and will take you on a musical journey which comes in with a flourish and doesn’t end until the last note of the whole album. Musically, if you were to strip away the lyrics, every song is a true portrayal of the message I am trying to send, with every section and rhythm thought out in terms of how best to tell the story. I’ve always believed Pink Floyd are the filmmakers of the music industry, effortlessly telling a story through their work. I strive to do the same. Expect drama, energy, contrast, passion and a story that needs to be heard.</p>

</div></div>","“Indie Artist Em Hoggett is earning rave reviews from some of the most prestigious critics in the music business.” – The C Magazine  
My name is Em Hoggett, and I am a critically-acclaimed artist and classically trained pianist. My training as a classical pianist began at the age of 4 and continued through my childhood and teenage years, achieving my first degree (ATCL) at age 11, and my second (LTCL) at 15. I was fortunate to perform with world-renowned pianist Lang Lang at the Royal Festival Hall in London and at the Fazioli Concert Hall in Italy, among many other notable venues. At the age of 13 I discovered a new passion: songwriting. And songwriting has become the key to healing me through my darkest times.
At 16, I was stripped of my power, my strength, my sexuality, my ability to trust, my ability to love, my ability to live. I was raped. 
But now, I am here to share my story of being REBORN. 
I am fortunate enough to be working with an incredible team of musicians including Melvin Brannon Jr (Booker T, Dan Reed Network), Tyler Hammond (Fred Durst, Limp Bizkit), Fire Mist (Sea At Last) and GRAMMY-nominated Bruce Witkin (Aerosmith, Marilyn Manson, Alice Cooper).

<h3>Together Apart: A new album</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi, I'm Brent Stewart. I'm a St. Louis-area musician. You can find out more about me at my website: <a href=""http://www.brentstewartmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.brentstewartmusic.com</a>.</p>
<p>I had a lot of plans to play live music and record a couple new albums this year, but as we all very well know, around March the world completely changed. Businesses were shuttered in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. People were asked to stay home and avoid large groups. The world kind of stopped, including many of the activities we love to do.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, I had written four songs and as February and March rolled around, I wrote five more. I had a collection of songs that I really felt reflected what is happening all over the world: A sense of isolation, even if we were all connected electronically. Even if we were sheltering in place with the people we care about the most. A greater sense of appreciation for the things that matter when everything seems like it's abruptly taken away.</p>
<p>Quarantined in my house with a lot of time on my hands, I began recording a new album. I enlisted a few folks to help who were also able to record in their homes: longtime friends Charlie Tabing on lead guitars and Jake DeLeonardis on bass (Jackhead, May Day Orchestra, Stace England,) along with Dakota Holden (The People vs. Hugh DeNeal, Miss Jenny and the Howdy Boys, The Magnatones) on pedal steel and guitar, Tony Barbata (John Henry, The Sleepy Rubies, Steve Ewing and many more) on drums and Dave Grelle (Funky Butt Brass Band, The Mighty Pines, Playadors and many, many more) on organ and piano. My friend Mike Lescelius of Misunderstudio in my hometown of Murphysboro, Ill, the engineer with whom I've worked with on every album I've done, was enlisted to put all of this together. My friend Mike Bass (<a href=""http://www.zip-dang.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.zip-dang.com</a>) did the amazing artwork.</p>
<p>I put down rough tracks and sent them to the musicians, they worked out their parts and recorded at their houses. We collaborated via text, e-mail and phone. Six musicians working separately, but actually on the same page in complete collaboration the entire time: Together Apart. </p>
<p>Here's one of the songs from the album:</p>

<h3>The STL Arts and Music Fund</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm a musician, but first and foremost, I'm a fan. I have a ridiculous collection of albums. I love live music. Growing up in Southern Illinois, thought Carbondale always had a vibrant local scene, St. Louis was the closest city where I could see a lot of bands that didn't come our way -- at places like Off Broadway, Mississippi Nights, The Pageant, The Duck Room, Cicero's and so on. Legendary venues. But it was more than just seeing touring bands, there were so many local musicians playing night in and night out, giving audiences the gift of great memories every time they stepped on the stage. </p>
<p>When all the local venues were closed in March, Ben Majchrzak of Native Sound Recording created the STL Arts and Music Fund. To date, they have raised $23,000 and have been able to give grants to countless musicians, but as of now, the fund is tapped out. With six months of lost revenue, and the ability to get out and play still hampered by the pandemic, St. Louis musicians are still hurting. </p>
<p>I'm a musician, but it's my second job. My wife and I are blessed with stable careers. But, I love live music and I can't wait to get out to play and and see shows like before. I donated to the fund, but I wanted to do more.</p>
<p>That is why I'm releasing my new album, Together Apart, in this IndieGoGo campaign. All proceeds -- except for the cost of the rewards, which should be minimal -- will go to benefit the STL Arts and Music Fund. To show appreciation for the musicians who get up on stage night after night and play their heart out. For us.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>There are really no risks to this campaign. The new album is recorded and mastered. It's ready to go to the manufacturer and digital files will go out to everyone who pledges to the campaign as soon as it's over.</p>
<p>We have a goal, but if that is not met, the money raised will still go to the STL Arts and Music Fund. I hope to raise much more, though!</p>

<p>If you're not interested in my music, but you're interested in the STL Arts and Music Fund, that's cool too. They're trying to evolve it from a Go Fund Me campaign to a full-fledged 501c3.

When I first left my hometown in Iowa for Nashville, I knew there was one thing I wanted to do- create something that matters.

Though I have been able to fund some of this project with money from gigs, session work, and coffee shop side-jobs, in order to finish this project for release in Summer 2019, I need additional funding to cover hefty recording costs, session musicians, and mixing/mastering. Just as any support in this project would mean the world to me, I’m hoping your involvement in the creation of these songs will mean something to YOU! My team and I have set up a funding program that allows you to be as involved as you want to be… (ever wanted your name in the liner notes of an album?) ... and allows us to send something right back as a small “thank you” for your much appreciated donation. </p>
<p>I am so grateful to have such a strong support system of family, friends, co-writers, and creators that treat and teach me with kindness. You all truly push me to dream bigger and love harder every day. This set of five songs holds moments and stories that matter to me. I hope they matter to you, too. Thank you for believing in me.</p> <p>All My Love,</p>

<p>I would love for you to join me on this big musical adventure moving forward into the fulfillment of promises. For that, I will share a little slice of my backstory.</p>
<p>I’ve always been a singer/songwriter! They couldn't stop me from singing down the hall in school and in class, most of the time I didn't even realise I was doing it!</p>
<p>I've been so blessed to spend the most amazing moments with my Dad, writing songs from a very young age, performing with him all across the UK on England’s festival circuit also hitting noteworthy venues in America. A daughter's dream and a very special gift to spend so much quality time with my Dad.  We had a Norah Jones vibe, which people loved at the time! </p>
<p>In early 2011, my wild spirit drew me to the USA where I spent time touring overseas, crafting a documentary about 'making it' in the music biz - we called it <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwckOJEN7kk"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><i>Gracie in America</i></strong></a>. Eye-opening and very raw, I captured what people would do to see their dreams fulfilled. It gave me the most real experience of what the process looked like and wow, did it hit me hard - in a beautiful way! I managed to survive and went on to record the EP <i><strong>Seasons </strong></i>and continued gigging until I felt the Lord ask me to give it up.</p>
<p>...which is when I launched a publishing company and wrote a series of children’s books. The <a href=""http://www.sillyeric.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><strong>Silly Eric</strong></i></a> series inspires children to dream BIG, never give up and to know they are loved just the way they are. I am still very active in this role and absolutely love talking to kids at their schools and teaching on these topics. I became a Young Ambassador with the Prince’s Trust and won two awards for my books and overcoming brain injury, which was the result of being hit by a car at age 11 and losing all of my memories.  On the plus side, it took me on the golden path of working with children for 16 years - what a privilege it has been to influence the children of the future! </p>
</div><p>I believe we all have such a purpose and are created to join together and lift each other up in our great adventure.  My passionate faith in the Lord has given me some of the most wonderful life stories of the impossible becoming possible and part of my story invites others to join in with me.  We are all made to dream big! And so here I am again, dreaming big, taking a risk and pursuing the sounds of heaven with this new musical project with <a href=""http://www.danstirling.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dan Stirling</a> and Rivers &amp; Robots! Check out their music so you can see how wonderful they are! This <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-syzaS0Hs0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">song </a>is a beautiful example of their hearts. </p><p>We are in the studio recording and the songs are sounding amazing but we need your help to complete this project!!! I am so excited about the sound that's being created, around the guitar and piano.

<p>I am Daniela Soledade, a musician from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I was born and raised in a musical family, growing up with Samba, Bossa Nova, and other Brazilian rhythms and influences.</p>
<p>My grandfather, Paulo Soledade, helped create Brazilian music foundations, composing with Tom Jobim, Vinícius de Moraes, Toquinho, Baden Powell and others in the pioneering phase of bossa nova. My father Paulinho is an artist-producer whose resume includes work with Ivan Lins and Gilberto Gil.  The Bossa Nova runs deep in my veins!</p>
<p>I grew up in Rio in a family of musicians, basically, on both sides--artists, actresses, ballerinas, musicians. And I grew up in recording studios. My father would ask me to sing on whatever he was working on, such as TV shows for the main network in Brazil, called Rede Globo.</p>
<p>The intimate, romantic aesthetic of true Bossa Nova is what I'm focusing on.  When I think of bossa nova, I think of Joao Gilberto and this really quiet aesthetic.  When I sing these songs I am trying to inhabit a unique, perfect moment that the musicians and the listeners share. </p>
<p>Making this album has always been a dream of mine! After opening a small business with my husband and having my two beautiful daughters, now is the perfect time to follow my dreams! It’s my number one project and I am putting everything into it.</p>
<p>Your support means THE WORLD to me! </p>
<p>I can't wait to share my music with you, and hopefully make you feel the same way I feel about it:) </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need the financial support to make the album and promote it. It takes money to make an album because we need to pay for the musicians, the recording studio, the production, mixing, mastering, artwork, and publicity and promotion. </p>
<p>I am hoping to have enough pre-orders of CD's, LP's and other perks to raise $25,000.  It sounds like a lot but it's really only 1000 CD's and a few LP's:)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of expenses:</p>
<p>Musician fees/travel costs/production/recording/mixing  $4000</p>
<p>Mastering for CD/digital and audiophile Vinyl LP master cutting $2000</p>
<p>CD and Audiophile Vinyl LP manufacturing $4000</p>
<p>Photos/videos/artwork $3000</p>
<p>Publicity/Radio Promotion/Marketing $12,000</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are doing the actual recording of ""A Moment Of You"" in mid April and have assembled a team of industry veterans to help launch the project.  </p>
<p>I'll be posting updates as pre-production continues and recording begins so you can stay up to date on the process and hear some of what we are doing.</p>
<p>Guitarist Nate Najar is arranging and producing the album and I can't imagine working with anybody else! Nate really understands the feeling and aesthetic of Bossa Nova.</p>
<p>We have GREAT perks for this project, including a digital download of the album, autographed CD's and autographed audiophile vinyl LP's of ""A Moment Of You"" AND we also have some unique and fun perks to share with you! For instance, Nate and I will come to your home and cook a dinner party for you and your guests and then give a private concert! You can also get handwritten copies of sheet music and lyrics or guitar lessons!</p>
<p>""A Moment Of You"" will be released on CD and digital on September 6, but when you support the project, you get the album in July!  The Audiophile Vinyl LP will be ready in November.</p>
<p>I am so excited about sharing my music with the world and I need YOUR support to get it out there!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>""A Moment Of You"" is about sharing that one unique and perfect moment. It's about feeling love, rejection, longing- feelings that make us alive. I wish to share this feeling through music and touch your life just like my own has been touched.  And there is no better way to inhabit that moment than with Bossa Nova!</p>
<p>By supporting the album before it is made, you can help us make ""A Moment Of You"" and also help us get it out there for new people to hear!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are so many deserving artists hoping interested listeners will give them a chance.  Many very fine albums don't ever get heard! One of our main challenges is getting the album heard after it has been made, and that's where publicity expenses come in - one of the reasons why we made this crowdfunding campaign:) </p>
<p>As pre-production continues and then the actual recording happens, I'll be posting updates and I really hope you like what you hear and want to lend your support. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whether or not you contribute, you can still help by sharing ""A Moment Of You"" on your social media and help others to discover the beauty of Bossa Nova! </p>

(Rent, bills, kids, ya?)</p><h3>BUT,<strong> I have a dream</strong>. I know you have a dream too. My dream is to release my EP 'MAC' out into the world this year. So, let me tell you a little about my dream for 30 seconds and share my heart with you. Sound good?</h3><p>I'm 23 years old, newly married to the love of my life, and making music that I believe could change lives. But, everyone believes in their music that way. What is it that makes mine so different? I'm glad you asked.  </p><p>I started this whole musical journey when I was 7 years old. You can check out my YouTube channel for all the juicy, vintage videos of my singing from way back then. I grew up singing and performing country music, but when I turned 16, something changed.

There is so much to say about the world and the thoughts in our brains than the typical topics of sex, partying, and breakup anthems.

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Hi all!!!This is Join The Din and we welcome you to our crowdfunding campaign.  <br/>Join The Din is an original band based in London, UK.</p>
<p>Since the release of our first EP in March 2018, we have been tirelessly gigging and writing new material. We now feel ready to produce our first full length Album; and to do so, we need your help!</p>
<p>Being a member of a fully DIY original band is exciting but also a definite challenge when it comes to covering recording and press expenses.  Everything we earn from live performances gets reinvested to improve the quality of our music: now though we need an extra boost to allow us to deliver a truly unique album...and here is where YOU get involved! </p>

<p>What we need is 2500 pounds to record and produce the album…. then, if you feel generous, with 3500 pounds we will press vinyls, with 4500 pounds we will have the chance to bring our music directly to your own town in UK and in Europe, with 6000 pounds or more we will create an original and immersive visual experience of one of our live concerts...</p>
<p>...Am sure you get the idea now :)The more We raise, the more We can do, the more We can offer YOU!</p>
<p>If you cannot back the project financially but would like to support us in some other ways, you can still help us with getting the word out and making some noise about our campaign.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It is not easy to ask for help but the only way that this record will come to fruition is with your generosity and kind support.  If this campaign is not fully funded, we will not be able to record the album. </p>
<p>As a band comprising of busy freelancers and professionals, our opportunities to invest money to record new works are limited. </p>
<p>Your support would allow us to give our time and energy to collaborate with new partners on a unique project, for an intense period, without distraction.</p>
<p>It would provide an invaluable opportunity to spend dedicated time as a band; to help us hone our creative processes and develop our new compositions. </p>
<p>The New Album will be the most ambitious project we have undertaken so far: 12 musicians, 2 sound engenieers, 2 recording studios and 1 graphic designer. Planning the work and coordinating so many incredible artists is a huge task and it demands constant effort.</p>
<p>Everyone involved is investing so much time, energy, talent and resources into this record, and we want to do it really well.  We are planning the recording process to start in March 2020 and we are confident that, once funded, the album will be ready for the Summer. </p>
<p>We are on track to deliver something unique:  All we need is Your SUPPORT!!!</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","The Project
Hi all!!!This is Join The Din and we welcome you to our crowdfunding campaign.  Join The Din is an original band based in London, UK.
Since the release of our first EP in March 2018, we have been tirelessly gigging and writing new material. We now feel ready to produce our first full length Album; and to do so, we need your help!
Being a member of a fully DIY original band is exciting but also a definite challenge when it comes to covering recording and press expenses.  Everything we earn from live performances gets reinvested to improve the quality of our music: now though we need an extra boost to allow us to deliver a truly unique album...and here is where YOU get involved! 
For this special occasion, we will also be collaborating with some of our favourite artists, musicians and creative dear friends.
Supporting our project will get you an inside look at the creative process as well as a variety of customised rewards to choose from. 
The new album will feature elements of Jazz, Rock and World Music combined with eletctronics and some exuberant improvisations.   
Thank you very much for watching,  listening and reading. Please share this project and spread the word. 
We truly appreciate your help.

<p> </p>
<h3>A BRIEF INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>MEMORIES OF OLD was born from the mind of Billy Jeffs, a life long fan of epic power metal, in order to lay a creative canvas to tell the story of THE ZERAMIN GAME, and unleash the many ideas for songs, melodies and lyrics that had been building up over the years.</p>
<p>Heavily influenced by many of the power metal greats, Billy decided to reach out to one of his biggest inspirations in Tommy Johansson (Majestica, Sabaton), to show what he had been working on, and this eventually led to Tommy contributing his great voice to bring the story to life.</p>
<p>Now, with two singles already released and the album ready to go into full production, we need YOUR help to achieve the level of funding we need and realise this dream, and with that in mind we are assembling FOWLEN'S ARMY, and inviting you to be a part of it!</p>
<p>You'll have the opportunity to get a lot of exclusive perks that will only be available here, and forever become a part of the bands history, as we start on an amazing journey that all starts right here, with the release of our debut album, THE ZERAMIN GAME</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔</h2>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Throughout the course of producing our first two singles, it became clear that producing this album was going to be quite a costly process, and has already resulted in some personal debt, so we have decided that unless we want to be releasing in several years, we are going to need your help! </p>
<p>So, we are looking for raise all the expenses we need to make this album a reality, which for the most part includes booking ourselves into the studio to finish recording, but there are other costs we need to consider, so we made a brief list of everything this campaign is helping to support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording, mixing and mastering</li>
<li>Cover artwork and Booklet design</li>
<li>Music Video and Photo Shoot</li>
<li>Personal expenses during the process</li>
</ul>
<p>To make this happen, we are looking to raise a total of £15,000, which will cover most if not all of the costs and will enable us to bring THE ZERAMIN GAME to you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>STRETCH GOALS</strong></p>
<p>In the event we manage to reach our target and more, we have set ourselves a stretch goal to make it clear where that money will go. If the campaign reaches £17,500, we will put this towards a second music video for the album, something we would love to bring you if we can, but isn't as essential as everything above.</p>
<p>If we hit that goal as well, anything further will be used to cover upcoming expenses for touring.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>PERKS</strong></p>
<p>So, what's in it for you? We have put together several packages that we certainly hope you will all love, and definitely be a rewarding thank you for the support you will be giving us. Here are just some of the items we have to offer across the packages:</p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">

Now, with two singles already released and the album ready to go into full production, we need YOUR help to achieve the level of funding we need and realise this dream, and with that in mind we are assembling FOWLEN'S ARMY, and inviting you to be a part of it!
You'll have the opportunity to get a lot of exclusive perks that will only be available here, and forever become a part of the bands history, as we start on an amazing journey that all starts right here, with the release of our debut album, THE ZERAMIN GAME
 
⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔
 

What We Need & What You Get
Throughout the course of producing our first two singles, it became clear that producing this album was going to be quite a costly process, and has already resulted in some personal debt, so we have decided that unless we want to be releasing in several years, we are going to need your help! 
So, we are looking for raise all the expenses we need to make this album a reality, which for the most part includes booking ourselves into the studio to finish recording, but there are other costs we need to consider, so we made a brief list of everything this campaign is helping to support:

Recording, mixing and mastering
Cover artwork and Booklet design
Music Video and Photo Shoot
Personal expenses during the process

To make this happen, we are looking to raise a total of £15,000, which will cover most if not all of the costs and will enable us to bring THE ZERAMIN GAME to you!
 
STRETCH GOALS
In the event we manage to reach our target and more, we have set ourselves a stretch goal to make it clear where that money will go. If the campaign reaches £17,500, we will put this towards a second music video for the album, something we would love to bring you if we can, but isn't as essential as everything above.
If we hit that goal as well, anything further will be used to cover upcoming expenses for touring.
 
PERKS
So, what's in it for you? We have put together several packages that we certainly hope you will all love, and definitely be a rewarding thank you for the support you will be giving us. Here are just some of the items we have to offer across the packages:


Digital Album - You'll receive a digital copy of the album, so if you can't quite stretch to a physical album or simply prefer having your music stored digitally, this is the perk for you.

Physical Album - A physical copy of The Zeramin Game, with the full colour booklet and also including a special bonus track, 'The Architect's Eyes'.

Exclusive Flag - A beautiful full colour flag, featuring exclusive Fowlen's Army artwork, which will only ever be available here.

Exclusive T-Shirt - Another crowdfund exclusive, this t-shirt will feature our very special Fowlen's Army, and will only ever be available here.

Limited Physical Singles - This is one for the collectors, a physical copy of our two singles, 'The Land of Xia' and 'Zeras Shadow', not released in stores and limited to 50 of each, once they're gone they're gone forever!

Signed Drumstick - A signed drumstick used on the recording of the album, each one marked with the initials of the song (or songs!) they were used to record.

Guestlist for Life* - This is exactly what it sounds like, you can be put on the guestlist for any future gigs we do, as many times as you want! *excluding festivals

FOWLEN'S ARMY FACEBOOK GROUP
ALL BACKERS will gain access to the closed Facebook group ""Fowlen's Army"" which will stay exclusive to campaign backers ONLY for the duration of the album production. In this group you will have access to extra content, behind the scenes action, merchandise pre-sales and more!! 
RELEASE & DELIVERY
We are currently planning to have the album ready for release around February/March 2020, and this is also the time frame we are looking at for the perks as well, however where possible we will always try to deliver perks as early as possible!

 
⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔
 

The Impact
Long story short, without you this album may never see the light of day, and as such we just wanted to let all of you know just how much your continued support means to us.
By supporting us through this campaign and becoming a part of FOWLEN'S ARMY, you are becoming a part of the band's history, something we will never forget, as this debut album will be the very thing that we use to get our name out there and start spreading our music around the world, and it all starts right here.
So from the bottom of our hearts, THANK YOU!
 

⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔⚔
 

Other Ways You Can Help
We totally understand that sometimes life can be a struggle, it may not be possible for everyone to contribute in the way they would like to, but fear not, there are still other ways you can help us which in the long run are just as important as the funds we're raising.
As we are a new band, getting our name out there and spreading the word is crucial, not only for this campaign but for the future of the band, so we will be eternally grateful for any help you can provide.
We have plenty of platforms online to share, so be sure to spread them around as much as possible!

<p>Who even are we? </p>
<p>We are Nicole Olney and Xander Hitzig, and we make folky tunes that soothe the soul! I, Nicole, have been living in Los Angeles for about 7 years now as an actress/writer/filmmaker, and met the brilliant traveling musician Xander when he flew into SoCal from West Virginia about 4 years ago. We met in a creative setting, a country musical to be exact (but that's a story for another time), and have since then formed a relationship largely based on mutual creation and support. </p>
<p>St. John's Dance started off as a twinkle in our eyes as Xander taught me how to really play the guitar and encouraged me to use my poetry to create songs. He helped me find my voice, while fine-tuning his own, and here we are, four years later with a hot new record to show for it!</p>
<p>This music video is so important to us because, in this content-driven society, we see it as a perfect opportunity to introduce ourselves and inform the world what we are all about: making incredible art, and making it accessible to everybody. We have invested so much time and love into the creation of our first record, Thirsty, that when it comes to releasing this baby to the public, we wanna get it right! And you can help us do that! </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get!</p>
<p> When you make your contribution, you are supplying us with:</p>
<p>The funds to rent a proper camera package/ insurance coverage for the shoot.</p>
<p>Food, lodging, and gas to nourish the lovely creative crew. </p>
<p>Money to hire incredibly talented friends who will make this video look like magic. </p>
<p>Not only are you helping us make a music video when you donate, but you become permanently engrained in this band's history! And we want to thank you for that. Some perks/ gifts that we are offering in exchange are:</p>
<p>$50 or more, you are the first one to see this video. You will receive an email from us personally thanking you, and attach the music video that you helped make happen!</p>
<p>$100 or more, you are the first one to receive a hard copy of our NEW E.P.! We will personally mail you our new record, with a genuine Venice Beach postcard, once this video is live.  </p>
<p>$150 or more, wow, who are you, are we friends? We must be. Here, have a new album but also have a St. John's Dance T-shirt deigned by the brilliant artist Matt J. Adams. </p>
<p>$200 or more, OMG take an E.P., take a t-shirt, and take a PRODUCER credit for this epic music video that you helped create. Show it off to your friends and slap it on your resume when it becomes a viral hit. </p>
<p>note: If you donate enough to receive a t-shirt/album/postcard, we will be sending you your gifts in the summer, when this E.P.  and video are completed! So please be patient as we, for lack of a finer term, get our shit together!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we are still making this video happen! We will just re-evaluate our budget accordingly and go from there. You will still be receiving the same perks if you donate! We will just have to get a little crafty is all! </p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>It sounds so cliché, but we, as St. John's Dance, really would not be where we are today without community support. From our living situation, to the recording studio we have access to, and everything in between, we are extremely grateful for the opportunities granted to us by our friends and family members that enable us to make our art! This music video is simply the next step in our journey, and we know that, as always, we need our community to help make it happen. </p>
<p>We feel confident that we will create something special with your help, a product that not only makes us proud, but you, too! Two years ago, I wrote, starred in, and co-created a short film that premiered at the Cannes film festival, with a micro-budget very similar to this one! Xander has, over the course of his rich musical history, created over eight albums with multiple bands with his original songs that have taken him all over the country/world. With our powers combined it is our intention to make a project that receives similar global attention! </p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>Of course, we make all of the plans we want, and then life happens. We know from experience that unforeseen difficulties can place strain on any creative endeavor. </p>
<p>That being said, we feel prepared to take on the responsibility of confronting these challenges, whatever they may be, and coming out the other side with a product that aligns with our vision.  </p>
<p>If it is a matter of money, we will either shave down expenses as necessary, or create another campaign to support ourselves appropriately. If we find that we need more time, we will recalibrate our schedules accordingly, and inform you about the updates! Our lives as artists over the years have been peppered with many a hurdle, and each one has made us ultimately better at what we do.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>So if you can't contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help!</p>
<p>We know times get tough, but money isn't everything! You can help us out by spreading the word about our campaign and help it get the attention and momentum it needs to get it fully funded! Use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word through the instagram, the facebook, the twitter, the tinder, the anything-you-can-think-of! </p>

The purpose of this campaign is to fund the recording, mixing, and mastering of 10 new songs for my next full-length LP, plus revamps of 4 songs to be released possibly as bonus tracks or singles.The new songs are thematically a continuation of my past stuff: girlfriends, political comedy, my feelings on current events. I wrote one song to go with a friend's screenplay (I'm trying to sell out to Hollywood).If you already know my work (thank you for that!) you may recognize the bonus songs to be recorded: ""Old Hussies Never Die,"" ""Angel Rant,"" ""Idiot for Love,"" and ""It's 12:01.""

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>My Backround:</h3><p>Hi, I'm Jasmine Cherí!  I am a multi-faceted artist on the verge of releasing my first album.  I grew up in a musical family where creative expression was greatly encouraged.  Both of my parents were musicians and had various creative talents.  From the time I was a small child, I found myself drawing, painting, singing, learning to play various instruments and dancing.  I have continued to cultivate my creative interests into adulthood, participating in art events, producing and performing my own music, taught partner dancing for ten years and now enjoy sharing my love for music as an on-air personality for Radio Margaritaville on SiriusXM.  </p><h3>Musical Influence and Genre:</h3><p>Growing up, my parents exposed me to music and instruments from all over the world.  This is where the world beat influence in my music comes from.  In high school I developed a love for dance and electronic music.  My music is an eclectic fusion of urban electronic sounds with the earthy notes of multi-cultural influence.  If I had to categorize it, I'd call it 'electro-acoustic worldbeat fusion'.  Others have described it as indie pop, EDM, chill step, electronic, world, ambient, etc.  In my 'sound' you will hear a variety of instruments including synth pads, hand drums, steel drum, sitar, Native American flute, cello, upright bass, marimba, ukulele, tremolo guitar, Spanish style guitar, saxophone and more.  My greatest musical influence concerning my vocal styling is Enya, so you will hear stacks of dreamy, atmospheric vocals in my music as well. </p><h3>The Journey, the Videos and the Art:</h3><p>Seven years ago I was inspired to complete a collection of music that I had been producing for my own enjoyment.  During this time of my life I was embarking on an incredible journey of shedding the pain and disappointment of the past.  My creative flow was on fire!  One song after another kept flowing out of me.  My inspiration for visual art was also exploding at this time.  I could barely keep up with the flood of creativity.  Little by little I realized that the themes in the artwork were very closely related and tied into the themes in the music, and then I began to get creative visions for music videos for each song.  It dawned on me that if this music and art helped me rise up out of some dark times of my life and was such a huge part of my healing process, I should share it with the rest of the world.  The themes revolve around hope, love, restoration, rising above and overcoming fear and doubt, discovering my true beauty and finding greater joy than I had ever experienced before...and of course there's a few love songs in there as well!  So I've altered some of this artwork for women's shirt designs that tie in with the album.  I currently have one music video completed for my single, ""Neon Fun"", which will be released this August!  Last summer I ventured to Kauai and captured some starter footage for several other videos, but there is more footage needed to complete the story lines.  You can see some of this footage in the promo video above! I have had many people ask me, ""Why music videos? They are so expensive!"".  Here is my answer:  Because I am just as passionate about visual art and dance as I am about music...to me, in my wildly creative mind, they are all connected.  To me, the music itself is very moving on it's own, but combined with the visuals, it adds a whole new level of artistry and expression that takes listener/viewer deeper into the heart and the storyline of the music in a fun and creative way.  Also, music videos are a great away to get exposure.  It's a creative platform that can reach people all over the world!   My original plan was to release the album last summer.  Due to some unexpected circumstances, it was delayed.  After overcoming various obstacles over the last year, I decided to put together this crowdfunding campaign to raise the funds needed to make the final push for this release.  The mixing and mastering of the album is #1 priority...but to complete these next two videos would be epic and a dream come true and give my listeners a deeper experience of the songs.</p><h3><strong>The Breakdown:</strong></h3><p>Where is all this money going??</p><p><strong>• Mixing and mastering</strong></p><p><strong>• Photography for album art, promotions and new website</strong></p><p><strong>• CD manufacturing</strong></p><p><strong>• Digital distribution, marketing, targeted ads, registration with BMI, etc</strong></p><p><strong>• Music video production for two more videos- this includes costumes, choreography, needed equipment and travel expenses</strong></p><p><strong>• 10% of final goal goes towards IndieGoGo as the campaign fee</strong></p><p><strong>• 30-50% of shirt sales goes towards the cost of the shirt and design printing</strong></p><p> </p><h3>Perks &amp; Incentives:</h3><p>In addition to pre-sale music, I am offering a variety of my other art forms!  Shirt designs, handmade jewelry, art prints and photography.  Below you will find detailed photos, to the right you will find the perk buttons for each item!  You have the option of adding on the digital or CD version of the album to any purchase.  Please feel free to send me a private message with any questions or concerns!</p><h3> </h3><h3>
<strong>Shirt Designs-</strong>  </h3><p>I've rendered some fun, colorful, and playful designs of my art into tank top designs just in time for the heat of summer!  Each tank comes with a digital download of the album once it is released. I've got multiple colors and sizes available. The ink is transluscent, which creates diversity in colors, brightness and texture depending on the shirt...so for those of you that prefer darker colors, I've got darker shirt options that tone down the brightness of the designs. You can select the color and size at point of purchase.  Look for the perk buttons to the right! (Please note that the design colors are going to appear more vivid on the screen than in real life)</p><h3>'Made to Fly' Parrot Design:</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561007305/b0oafj8f7qhimmuojhc5.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561007330/rhpsectxj3wduwxhhbyz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561179263/cfxxynk0dy012hkh6ta6.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>'Made to Play' Whale Design:</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561007665/a5pmfqmj03bhhvjzqxhr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561179299/swgvrp66qhjx2x4jnh33.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>'Soul Surfing Shell' Design:</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561086486/wttwluerbtlzgyloobjb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561007856/xa6tvdvuyqx3xwhgcyir.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561086510/jtjpb5e3wufy1kamrhgo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2>NEW Men's Variations:</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565151609/h2pemqpy2i6ltcf5sapn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>'Creative Flow' Design:</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562012462/r3b1s6yuvh4fp1zqolhq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562012506/akqivlhpaarno0xoc4fh.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562012533/egwgkxajerpinyaaef8w.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>'Made for Adventure' Sailboat Design:</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561086774/lgzk0smrgjeujnt9u7p9.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561179359/kb3ju8bgg1twz4zknfjk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561086814/wxszzrtcnj8qumdhvw8q.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2>NEW Men's Variations:</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565151691/skoqnstumash4x14vfpa.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Handmade jewelry-</strong> I've been crafting and selling jewelry since I was 11 years old!

 I am a multi-faceted artist on the verge of releasing my first album.  I grew up in a musical family where creative expression was greatly encouraged.  Both of my parents were musicians and had various creative talents.  From the time I was a small child, I found myself drawing, painting, singing, learning to play various instruments and dancing.  I have continued to cultivate my creative interests into adulthood, participating in art events, producing and performing my own music, taught partner dancing for ten years and now enjoy sharing my love for music as an on-air personality for Radio Margaritaville on SiriusXM.  Musical Influence and Genre:Growing up, my parents exposed me to music and instruments from all over the world.  This is where the world beat influence in my music comes from.  In high school I developed a love for dance and electronic music.  My music is an eclectic fusion of urban electronic sounds with the earthy notes of multi-cultural influence.  If I had to categorize it, I'd call it 'electro-acoustic worldbeat fusion'.  Others have described it as indie pop, EDM, chill step, electronic, world, ambient, etc.  In my 'sound' you will hear a variety of instruments including synth pads, hand drums, steel drum, sitar, Native American flute, cello, upright bass, marimba, ukulele, tremolo guitar, Spanish style guitar, saxophone and more.  My greatest musical influence concerning my vocal styling is Enya, so you will hear stacks of dreamy, atmospheric vocals in my music as well. The Journey, the Videos and the Art:Seven years ago I was inspired to complete a collection of music that I had been producing for my own enjoyment.  During this time of my life I was embarking on an incredible journey of shedding the pain and disappointment of the past.  My creative flow was on fire!  One song after another kept flowing out of me.  My inspiration for visual art was also exploding at this time.  I could barely keep up with the flood of creativity.  Little by little I realized that the themes in the artwork were very closely related and tied into the themes in the music, and then I began to get creative visions for music videos for each song.  It dawned on me that if this music and art helped me rise up out of some dark times of my life and was such a huge part of my healing process, I should share it with the rest of the world.  The themes revolve around hope, love, restoration, rising above and overcoming fear and doubt, discovering my true beauty and finding greater joy than I had ever experienced before...and of course there's a few love songs in there as well!  So I've altered some of this artwork for women's shirt designs that tie in with the album.  I currently have one music video completed for my single, ""Neon Fun"", which will be released this August!  Last summer I ventured to Kauai and captured some starter footage for several other videos, but there is more footage needed to complete the story lines.  You can see some of this footage in the promo video above! I have had many people ask me, ""Why music videos? They are so expensive!"".  Here is my answer:  Because I am just as passionate about visual art and dance as I am about music...to me, in my wildly creative mind, they are all connected.  To me, the music itself is very moving on it's own, but combined with the visuals, it adds a whole new level of artistry and expression that takes listener/viewer deeper into the heart and the storyline of the music in a fun and creative way.  Also, music videos are a great away to get exposure.  It's a creative platform that can reach people all over the world!   My original plan was to release the album last summer.  Due to some unexpected circumstances, it was delayed.  After overcoming various obstacles over the last year, I decided to put together this crowdfunding campaign to raise the funds needed to make the final push for this release.  The mixing and mastering of the album is #1 priority...but to complete these next two videos would be epic and a dream come true and give my listeners a deeper experience of the songs.The Breakdown:Where is all this money going??• Mixing and mastering• Photography for album art, promotions and new website• CD manufacturing• Digital distribution, marketing, targeted ads, registration with BMI, etc• Music video production for two more videos- this includes costumes, choreography, needed equipment and travel expenses• 10% of final goal goes towards IndieGoGo as the campaign fee• 30-50% of shirt sales goes towards the cost of the shirt and design printing Perks & Incentives:In addition to pre-sale music, I am offering a variety of my other art forms!  Shirt designs, handmade jewelry, art prints and photography.  Below you will find detailed photos, to the right you will find the perk buttons for each item!  You have the option of adding on the digital or CD version of the album to any purchase.  Please feel free to send me a private message with any questions or concerns! 
Shirt Designs-  I've rendered some fun, colorful, and playful designs of my art into tank top designs just in time for the heat of summer!  Each tank comes with a digital download of the album once it is released. I've got multiple colors and sizes available. The ink is transluscent, which creates diversity in colors, brightness and texture depending on the shirt...so for those of you that prefer darker colors, I've got darker shirt options that tone down the brightness of the designs. You can select the color and size at point of purchase.  Look for the perk buttons to the right! (Please note that the design colors are going to appear more vivid on the screen than in real life)'Made to Fly' Parrot Design:'Made to Play' Whale Design: 'Soul Surfing Shell' Design:NEW Men's Variations:'Creative Flow' Design:'Made for Adventure' Sailboat Design:NEW Men's Variations: Handmade jewelry- I've been crafting and selling jewelry since I was 11 years old!  I took a break from it to focus more on music, but have made a special jewelry series just for this campaign using copper, abalone, dentalium tusk shells, vintage beads and gemstones.  Each piece is one of a kind and comes with a download of my first single once it's released!  You have the option of adding the full digital album at the point of purchase.  Each piece has a perk button of it's own.  You can view the detailed photos here and find the buttons to the right!  (Please note that the colors on the screen may differ slightly from real life)
Art Prints- Here is a collection of prints of my original drawings and paintings. They are matte finished, hand signed and come with a download of my first single once it's released!  You have the option of adding the full digital album at the point of purchase.  They are printed within an 11""x17"" space, but not all of them are those exact dimensions. The name for each work of art is above the photo in bold lettering.  Each one has a perk button of it's own.  You can view the detailed photos here and find the buttons to the right! (Please note that the colors on the screen may differ slightly from the real life print)Nose Kiss:Hope Tree:Freedom:Journey:Creative Flow:Made for Adventure:Everlasting Love & New Life:Made to Fly:Flamingo Fancy:Soul Surfing Shell: in aqua, rainbow or henna

<h3>The Same and Far Away EP</h3>
<p>For years I have been searching for my signature sound. I've tried many styles and pushed myself to write in new ways, but in the last few years I've returned to my roots, picked up my acoustic guitar and given in to the music that came most naturally. I'm proud of these songs and feel that they truly reflect who I am as an artist.</p>
<p>In February 2019, I assembled a killer band and debuted these new songs. In the audience was my friend, Will Kennedy, an incredible sound engineer and producer. Will loved the songs so much that he agreed to partner with me to record them as beautifully as we can. I am so grateful for his confidence in this project and can't wait for you all to hear the work we make together!</p>
<p>As an independent artist it is crucial to have the support of your community to sustain you. I have so many incredible people in my life that have supported me and believed in me and my creative endeavors. I hope that you will consider being a part of this project and a part of my career as an artist. Your contributions mean everything to me and are a source of encouragement I can't even begin to describe. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>I've been blessed with an amazing team that is helping me make this project as affordably as possible. I'm hoping to raise $4,000 that will go towards the cost of:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 days of studio time</li>
<li>Paying the incredible musicians that will be featured on the EP</li>
<li>Mixing and mastering</li>
<li>Distribution fees (getting music on online selling/streaming platforms)</li>
<li>Making physical copies</li>
<li>Creating a small line of merchandise (t-shirts, stickers, etc) for perks and sale at shows</li>
<li>Promotion and marketing</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>Well, the short answer to this question is that it keeps artists <strong>out of debt.</strong> Independent artists are basically their own small businesses. Any new project requires capital to make it happen. Some are blessed to have thousands of dollars of their own money to invest into their projects, and some, like me, are freelancers who piece together their income tour by tour, gig by gig, side hustle by side hustle. </p>
<ul>
<li>For me, crowdfunding is an opportunity to get my record made without emptying out my own personal bank account.</li>
<li>For you, crowdfunding is an opportunity for you to <strong>be my record label.</strong>
</li>
<li>By contributing to my project you are saying that you are invested in me as an artist, that you want to be a part of my work, and that you believe that final project will be worth your investment.</li>
<li><p>My campaign for my last album was a success and has inspired me to work even harder to make something that you will love. I'm always striving to improve and your support encourages me in that.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some of you may not be able to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Share, share, share, share! The internet is an amazing tool that helps ideas get spread all the time. Please consider sharing on your socials to help me reach fans I don't know yet.</li>
<li>Word of mouth is worth more than gold! If you have a friend, family member, or co-worker that you think might like what I'm doing, talk to them about the campaign, show them one of my videos, direct them to my music on Spotify...etc. I know I am way more likely to check something out if it is directly referred to me by someone that knows me well.</li>

<p>My name is Aelita Yoon, and I'm a singer/songwriter. Or well, that was what the plan was.</p>
<p>But for the last 8 years, I've had to put my own lyrics aside to translate other people's and sing with those. I was never financially supported in music, and I didn't have the right networks to release anything more than a songwriting contest entry that made it to Finals in middle school.</p>
<p>Lacking any foundation for a solid audience following, I started out in YouTube's amateur Japanese song cover community, colloquially referred to as the ""Youtaite community"" (a portmanteau of ""YouTube"" and the Japanese slang, ""utaite"", which is a pun on the characters for ""singer (kashyu)"").</p>
<p>Now that I'm an adult in the age of the Internet and social connection, I'm growing weary of the translation process, and<strong> I've had a strong desire to return to my roots as a songwriter.</strong></p>
<p>I met the producer of the project indirectly through the Dextra community when we found that no one was responding to our requests for a collaboration. Seeing as we literally lived about an hour away from each other, we got to work with the first track.</p>
<p><i><strong>The first track just finished recording vocals on June 19th, 2019.</strong></i> Within 2-3 weeks time, the track will be ready for public release with its own music video that I'll be animating!</p>
<p><strong>But, an EP is supposed to be 4-5 tracks</strong>. And there are still many songs I'd like to work on to add to this EP by the time the first single's promotion releases! That's where YOU come in!</p>

<p>This EP is a part of a bigger umbrella project I've been working on for the past year called the <strong><i>chantabille project</i></strong>. It's a self-love multimedia introspective journey I set out on as the grey-haired, gold-rimmed spectacled lover of life that I named ""Chantabille"" over a year ago to work through my mental health difficulties. I had a trail of failures and embarrassments spanning over 10 years, and zero hope going into the project, but it not only<strong> inspired me to keep making music, it also helped me heal.</strong></p>
<p>This EP is a way to give back to the Youtaite and anime-song communities that have helped me grow so much during my time in university and during life after graduation. <strong>The lyrics are both honest and painful, but always end with bravery and inspiration</strong>. The reason why this EP is planned for streaming and ""pay-what-you-can"" is because I want to make it <strong>as accessible as possible</strong>, but that needs a lot of support from those who can afford to help!</p>
<p>Music is a powerful language, and I've been lucky to team up with a producer who's been working in the music industry for over 10 years. I'd love to continue this collaboration so that the EP reaches as many people as possible.</p>

Or well, that was what the plan was.
But for the last 8 years, I've had to put my own lyrics aside to translate other people's and sing with those. I was never financially supported in music, and I didn't have the right networks to release anything more than a songwriting contest entry that made it to Finals in middle school.
Lacking any foundation for a solid audience following, I started out in YouTube's amateur Japanese song cover community, colloquially referred to as the ""Youtaite community"" (a portmanteau of ""YouTube"" and the Japanese slang, ""utaite"", which is a pun on the characters for ""singer (kashyu)"").
Now that I'm an adult in the age of the Internet and social connection, I'm growing weary of the translation process, and I've had a strong desire to return to my roots as a songwriter.
I met the producer of the project indirectly through the Dextra community when we found that no one was responding to our requests for a collaboration. Seeing as we literally lived about an hour away from each other, we got to work with the first track.
The first track just finished recording vocals on June 19th, 2019. Within 2-3 weeks time, the track will be ready for public release with its own music video that I'll be animating!
But, an EP is supposed to be 4-5 tracks. And there are still many songs I'd like to work on to add to this EP by the time the first single's promotion releases! That's where YOU come in!
 
 
 
 
 


The plans for this EP release are via Spotify and iTunes streams, as well as pay-what-you-can on Bandcamp, with an option for physical goods (more info in STRETCH GOALS). Because the expected financial turnout of this is quite low, we need a strong financial foundation going into the rest of the production. The first track has already been invoiced and paid for. What I'm asking for is support in funding the rest of the EP.
 

 
 
 
 
 

As a thank-you for your support, the following perks are available!

a DL code for the full digital EP OR the title track, ""Gemini"" for free + a digital postcard + name credits in the Bandcamp release under ""SUPPORT TEAM""
+ a physical print of the Tier 1 postcard mailed to you
+ a handmade zine containing production notes, lyrics and album cover iterations
+ a physical CD of the full EP, created the same way I made my first EP (super scrappy, but made with love!) + a handwritten thank-you note
+ an English dub of an anime song/Vocaloid/video game OST per your request, fully mixed and mastered with a matching illustration (the YouTube video without the video, and exclusively for you)


Regardless of whether the goal is achieved or not, the EP will still be released. The difference will be in the quality of the work, or the number of tracks that are actually worked on with the producer, and which ones I'll have to create on my own. The quality of the EP release will be entirely dependent on the success of this campaign! To ensure that the donations are maximized, I've made sure that all of the perks were financially achievable about of my own pocket, NOT from the donation pot.

<h3>""So, what's with the name?""</h3>
<p>After having a lot of inspiration for new music, I think the songs took up most of it - leaving little imagination left for the name! I've been ""Sam Brett"" before, and the music I released back then was very different to the music I want to release now. Just wanted a fresh start. So naturally, I went to a random name generator!</p>
<p>It churned out a mass of two word phrases, a couple including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split Chance </li>
<li>Tension Dealer</li>
</ul>
<p>Didn't like either one, however, Split the Dealer felt right.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>""What's the plan?""</h3>
<p>The plan is to release a cover of a famous song you'll all know, but won't expect, on Spotify. I also want to film a session video for it, in a really cool location.</p>
<p>(That's all you get to know about it so far!)</p>
<p>Then, after promoting the session using Facebook and Instagram adverts, alongside reaching out to blogs, pages, and playlists - I'm going to release my debut single in late September!</p>
<p>I'll be recording the audio for the session the same day as the single, to save costs. Depending on the budget, we'll also try and make a music video for the new year.</p>
<p>For the single, I'd like to get a PR company on board, as well as host a launch party gig where I'll invite industry people, with Indigogo backers getting a free ticket!</p>

<h3>""How will my contribution help?""</h3>
<p>I'm working 30 to 40 hours a week, making ends meet as well as building a budget. Most of my free time is spent creating, planning, and building Split The Dealer. Your contribution will take a big strain off building the budget, and will allow me to improve the quality of the music I'm putting out.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>""I don't have a lot of money to spare, how else can I help?""</h3>
<p>That's completely cool, the fact that you want to support is more than enough! There are many ways to help, even just sharing the new content, telling your friends, and listening to the music is huge. Following my Split The Dealer socials is also a massive contribution:</p>

<p><strong>Hello friend! I'm Kennedy Frohawk and I'm a singer-songwriter in Nashville, Tennessee.</strong></p>
<p>Even before I became a musician eleven years ago, I knew there was something so magical about music. Any time that I was feeling any particularly strong emotions, I could always relate them back to a song. I found that through this connection with music, I was slowly becoming an emotionally healthier person; I was expressing my emotions in more appropriate ways. As someone who is highly emotional, I feel all my highs and lows at an extreme, and I always let it show. (That whole ""heart on your sleeve"" thing? Yeah, totally me.) Only I never really found the balance between letting them show and letting them affect my social life. At least, not until I found another outlet to express them through music.</p>
<p>The great thing about music is that there is literally a song for every emotional situation under the sun. Being able to sing in the shower, or dance in the car, or even just quietly dive deep into the lyrics with your headphones on -- it's all so important to letting ourselves feel. So with this album, I want to contribute to that repertoire of emotionally impactful songs. Every song on this album stems from my own experiences where my emotions seemed to peak. <strong>My hope is that by sharing them with you, you are able to relate on some level and express your own feelings in a healthy way.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Through this campaign, I am raising the funds necessary for creating and distributing my first full-length studio album. It'll be engineered and produced by Brian Connelly with help from Luke Sanders. </strong>I have worked with both of them on previous studio projects and I have always been happy with the work that went into bringing my music to life.<strong> ""Cinderella Complex"" is a song from my first EP, which both of them had a hand in engineering.

<div>Though I am going in a different direction stylistically with this next project than I have in the past, I am positive that this album will be high-quality with their help. However, such quality comes at a price, so here is the break down of what your donation will help me cover:</div>
<div> </div>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Pre-production</strong>: Where it all begins. During this stage of development, Brian, Luke, and I will arrange each of the songs and discuss the overall sound. Each song will be broken down to its main elements and fine-tuned to achieve the appropriate feel before starting the recording process.</li>
<li>
<strong>Recording</strong>: At this point, we begin tracking the music and programming the digital instruments.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mixing and Mastering</strong>: This is where the real magic happens. The raw tracks that were captured in the recording phase will be balanced and edited so that the songs have the right texture and color. They will then be mastered to make the project a cohesive listening experience.</li>
<li>
<strong>Duplication</strong>: Since this album is to be available as a physical disc, each individual CD will need to have music burned onto it, and the discs and the disc jackets will need to be printed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Distribution</strong>: The music will also be available on most digital platforms, so your contribution will also help to pay for an aggregator to get my album available to you on websites such as Spotify and Apple Music.</li>

<h3>Help Make <i>Exótico Americano </i>Happen !</h3>
<p>I, Frederico7, am a Brazilian-born musician based out of Austin-TX and together with my outstanding band, we create soulful, creative and uplifting music that honors our cultural roots while embracing innovation.  We make music in three languages (English, Portuguese, Spanish) in styles fusing Samba, Funk, Reggae, Soul, Rock &amp; more.</p>
<p>By purchasing our music and merchandise here you will be supporting a musical vision of Pan-American unity and love. More of this is exactly what we need in these times of political discord, theatrics about massive border walls, and cages separating families in a broken system.</p>
<p>When we hold space to hear our collective stories, to step into curiosity and put ourselves into another's shoe; we start to see complexities previously unimagined, and often, we realize how much our stories intersect, That idea is a big inspiration for 'Exotico Americano'. </p>
<p>In 2018 I accomplished a huge step in the American Dream that so many of us immigrants hold dear - I became a naturalized United States citizen after 20 years of service as an artist and educator. While the USA is in a current state of chaos, I believe together we can make a difference and re-learn how to appreciate the melting pot that is the United States. Because THAT is what makes America great! And that is what this album is all about, celebrating the diversity that are the Americas (north, central, and south!). With that being said, will you help me accomplish my Exotico Americano dream by supporting this album?</p>
<p><u><strong>COSTS TO PRODUCE EXOTICO AMERICANO: $9,750.00</strong></u></p>
<p>That includes: Recording Expenses; Album Mastering; CD manufacturing; Artwork; Photo/Video production; Distribution; PR Campaign.</p>
<p>WHY AM I ASKING $4000?</p>
<p>-Being able to raise $4000 through pre-sales of CDs, Digital Downloads, Merchandise and other cool stuff would enable me to afford the record's PR and Radio Campaign and to afford to have merchandise and CDs to sell at future shows (to recover from the almost 10k in project debt). This would make a difference in being able to release more music in the future.</p>
<p>The record is done and is ready to be released. We have the product in hands so there is no worries as to this project not being accomplished. Being able to meet our goal, in addition to much needed financial help, would provide warmth and validation from our community that our musical work is relevant in these confusing times.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Let's do this!</p>
<p>If you can't contribute, that's okay! We're still glad you're here, and you can still help in a big way! Help us out by:</p>
<p>1. Sharing this campaign on social media to get the word out using IndieGoGo's share tools!</p>
<p>2. Making some noise about our campaign to your community!</p>

<p>The Red Museum is an old fruit-packing warehouse on the outskirts of Mansion Flats that has transformed into an epicenter of experimentation and raw arts culture in Sacramento. We provide affordable practice/studio space to local creatives and occasionally host highly-curated events that bring people of different ages, ethnicities, genders, economic backgrounds, and tastes together to experience new music, performance, food, and visual art for a reasonable entry price. We believe in the cultural value of providing exposure for emerging artists and we never want money to be a barrier between a good artist and a successful artist. We also want the public, no matter their demographic, to have access to this culture through our events.</p>
<p>This is the third year we have produced the Red Ex event, which raises funds that help us continue to operate throughout the year. Simply put, <strong>this event is how we survive.</strong> We’re looking to the community for support, but we are also giving back an event that represents the diversity of the current up-and-coming talent in our city. Sacramento has a warm community of artists and art supporters who are open to experiencing new things, making our city a really unique incubator for creativity.</p>
<p>The success of this project will demonstrate that there is a path to helping art spaces survive in a changing and gentrifying city.

<h3>The Quick Pitch</h3>
<p>It’s true, this project is already finished! In that way, this is a non-traditional crowdfunding campaign, and more of a pre-order campaign. It’s my hope that you will take this as a show of how committed I am to this project, to my music. It is also my hope, that you’ll take to heart the idea that crowdfunding is “the new record deal,” and that your support here will make it possible for me to keep creating amazing new music (and funding incredible visual art) in the future! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Backstory...</h3>
<p>Five years ago, I started to feel some big ideas brewing in my mind and body. I was beginning to face the truth of my <strong><a href=""https://emvocals.com/masks-part-ii-mom/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mom’s personality disorder</a></strong>, my misconceptions about what my potential could be as an individual (and particularly, as a woman), and the many-layered facades of the institutions of power that held up my world.</p>
<p>I felt that nothing was what it seemed.</p>
<p>So, I began writing on the theme of masks. Masks that conceal and manipulate. Masks that protect. Masks that reveal, filter, focus, or magnify a specific self. Provisional masks. Playful masks. Beautiful masks. Terrifying masks. I believe these are essentially and ubiquitously human concepts and experiences. And I’ve done my very best to represent as many facets of these themes as possible with this collection of songs, all original. I know you’ll see your life experience reflected in this music, and in these lyrics.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>Once the collection of songs was completed, I searched around for the perfect producer, and found my now good friend (and brilliant artist) Jed Jones! Together, we spent a whole year sparing no expense to hire the best musicians, record at the best studio, and secure the best mixing and world-class mastering. I got the masters back in March 2019. And honestly, that felt like just the beginning!</p>
<p>I’ve spent the last year assembling a brilliant team of visual artists to help me create companion pieces for every single one of my songs.</p>
<p>I’ve spent countless hours building my website to the perfect specs that will allow it to properly and beautifully host this colossal project, taking digital marketing classes, researching the best ways to get all of this incredible audio+visual art to as many people as will love it. I’ve done my very best to leave no stone un-turned—to do my part and more to make sure this body of work has the life it deserves.</p>

<h3>The Team, The Impact</h3>
<p>This is the part where I need your help! I believe in the value of art. I believe in the power art has to move and change the world. And I’m BEYOND proud of the artists whose careers I’ve personally been able to support thus far with Masks. Can I introduce you to them?</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It’s been difficult for me to come up with a dollar amount, because I’ve invested more of my own funds than I feel comfortable asking for here. And, I really DO feel awesome about supporting so many of my fellow artists with my own funds. But, $8,000 is the number I’ve landed on that would really make it possible for me to keep these mixed-media, collaborative projects coming. If I’m able to raise more than the $8,000 I need, I’ll just make even more content with even more beautiful artists!</p>
<p>To find out more about each perk bundle, click on the box to see all of the details! They’re stacked, so (with a few exceptions) each level includes all of the perks from the lower pledge amounts. These amazing digital and physical items represent thousands of dollars, and hundreds of hours of work from some incredible artists. I am so excited to be able to offer them to you!</p>
<p>Before I tell you more about these PHENOMENAL perks, I want to say: (1) Every donation of any amount means the absolute world to me (2) You don’t need to claim a perk to make a contribution (3) You are OF COURSE welcome to contribute a higher amount than the perk level you’d like to claim (4) If you are not in a position to contribute financially, you can help by sharing the campaign on social media (use the Indiegogo share tools on the top of the page), and in specific texts/emails to people you know would love to be involved. And, you can stream the previously-released singles! Thank you. You so important to me.</p>

<h3>Thank You!</h3>
<p>From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU! I can't wait for all of this art to reach your eyes and ears.</p>
</div></div>","The Quick Pitch
It’s true, this project is already finished! In that way, this is a non-traditional crowdfunding campaign, and more of a pre-order campaign. It’s my hope that you will take this as a show of how committed I am to this project, to my music. It is also my hope, that you’ll take to heart the idea that crowdfunding is “the new record deal,” and that your support here will make it possible for me to keep creating amazing new music (and funding incredible visual art) in the future! 

The Backstory...
Five years ago, I started to feel some big ideas brewing in my mind and body. I was beginning to face the truth of my mom’s personality disorder, my misconceptions about what my potential could be as an individual (and particularly, as a woman), and the many-layered facades of the institutions of power that held up my world.
I felt that nothing was what it seemed.
So, I began writing on the theme of masks. Masks that conceal and manipulate. Masks that protect. Masks that reveal, filter, focus, or magnify a specific self. Provisional masks. Playful masks. Beautiful masks. Terrifying masks. I believe these are essentially and ubiquitously human concepts and experiences. And I’ve done my very best to represent as many facets of these themes as possible with this collection of songs, all original. I know you’ll see your life experience reflected in this music, and in these lyrics.

The Process
Once the collection of songs was completed, I searched around for the perfect producer, and found my now good friend (and brilliant artist) Jed Jones! Together, we spent a whole year sparing no expense to hire the best musicians, record at the best studio, and secure the best mixing and world-class mastering. I got the masters back in March 2019. And honestly, that felt like just the beginning!
I’ve spent the last year assembling a brilliant team of visual artists to help me create companion pieces for every single one of my songs.
I’ve spent countless hours building my website to the perfect specs that will allow it to properly and beautifully host this colossal project, taking digital marketing classes, researching the best ways to get all of this incredible audio+visual art to as many people as will love it. I’ve done my very best to leave no stone un-turned—to do my part and more to make sure this body of work has the life it deserves.


The Team, The Impact
This is the part where I need your help! I believe in the value of art. I believe in the power art has to move and change the world. And I’m BEYOND proud of the artists whose careers I’ve personally been able to support thus far with Masks. Can I introduce you to them?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Brooklyn-based SUNDUB, an inventively collaborative mix of New York City musicians, has been offering its classic reggae repertoire peppered with soul and funk selections almost weekly since 2013. Anchored by a core quintet—Finnegan Singer (guitar), Josh T Carter (bass), Eric ""The General"" Toussaint (vocals-key) and the brother-sister team of Joanna (lead vocals) and Ben Teters (vocals-drums)—many of SUNDUB’s stellar and frequent collaborators have come together for its first production of original music, ""Burden of Love."" The album features reggae royalty Ruff Scott, The Chronic Horns (Easy Star All-Stars), Larry McDonald (Lee Scratch Perry, Gil Scott-Heron) and is mixed and co-produced by Sidney Mills (Steel Pulse). They lend their talents to Joanna Teters' commanding and soulfully smoky lead vocals and blend seamlessly with the super tight arrangements of the SUNDUB rhythm section. The result is a stand out expression of reggae’s classic undulating pulse and lush subterranean grooves, reinvented for listeners of all times and genres.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Ever since Evan Moses' first performance on his streetcorner in Georgetown early on in the Pandemic, our band has been continually amazed by the great response from community members, music fans, and passersby. </p>
<p>Our weekend shows quickly grew and relocated to Rose Park, in Georgetown, and we were humbled by the number of recurring fans and community members who continually came out on Saturday nights to enjoy live performances and work with us to raise awareness of the issues facing performers, sound technicians, venues and service industry workers who are hurting due to COVID-19 related closures.</p>
<p>Our ability to work with local artists and put on shows was dependent on the equipment and technical skills of Aaron Miller from Gold Pants Rentals, who provided us with a lot of the hardware required to put on shows.  Unfortunately, Aaron is moving on to greener pastures, and we are left without the tools we need to resume our weekly shows this Spring. Without Aaron, and without the shows, we can't pay our sound folks, pay our guest musicians, or donate to any local causes in need of support, as we've done in the past. </p>
<p>This is how you can help -- </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Rock Creek Kings need funding to enable us to resume our Rose Park Concert Series this Spring.  Our primary goal is to ensure we can resume our shows and give the community the performances they came to expect last April through November, which includes paying our sound engineers and guest artists for their valuable time and efforts. We'd also like to purchase equipment sufficient to replace the gear Aaron Miller was renting to us, and build out our show capacity so that we can safely play to similar, if not larger, audiences, with better quality performances.</p>
<p>The graphic below shows what we will be able to afford depending on how much is raised: </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614635500/fhjagzu0wsga6yafvuzj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>The Perks!</strong></h3>
<p>Our focus is on being able to perform, which is the 'perk' that everyone will be able to enjoy. Since our objective is to raise funds to permit the shows to resume, we're trying to keep most of the money available for that purpose (equipment is expensive and sound professionals can, and should, be well paid!)  </p>
<p>For those that are going above and beyond to help us, we designed special edition masks and t-shirts and we hope that you wear them to the shows.  For the higher end of donations, we also have song requests and private performances available! If you're eligible for a song request, your best bet is to choose a band you love rather than a song itself, because that way we can find a song from the artist that matches our style, and you can get the best performance from us. However, if you really love a song and want us to play it, we'll make it happen (subject to our ultimate approval - but we promise to be reasonable!). ​</p>
<p>The private performances will also be subject to reasonable COVID-related restrictions. Hopefully we will be able to deliver them in person over the summer for your private event, but its possible that they will have to be online if you can't wait until we're all vaccinated! If you're having an outdoor event this summer, we can perform in masks if there is reasonable space. </p>
<p>Finally, if you have any ideas for other perks you think would be perfect for our campaign, don't be shy! Let us know and we can find a way to integrate your idea.  </p>

<p>Putting on the shows in Rose Park (and earlier in the year on Dumbarton Corner) was easily the most rewarding part of our year. After every show, without fail, someone would come up to us and explain how they have been stuck inside and that the shows were a lifesaver! We were blown away week after week and it kept us motivated.  Putting on the shows definitely wasn't easy but it was a labor of love. We were loading up our cars with tons of heavy gear at 5, arriving around 6PM to set up and we were always right up against the clock to get everything ready to start at 7. We would have the time of our lives jamming from 7 to 9 and then take down all the gear, load it back up in our cars, and then finally load everything into Evan Moses' house. </p>
<p>However, your feedback and support made it all worth it.  The community always found a way to let us know we were supported! We got cards in the mail and messages to our Instagram week after week.</p>
<p>We put on over fifteen shows in the park last year and two were direct fundraisers for local charitable causes.  This spring and summer, we pledge to run at least <strong><u>four</u></strong> shows directly fundraising for local causes. An early favorite for the beneficiaries would be the survival funds for the staff of the Pie Shop, Black Cat, and other venues, but we're open to ideas!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>From A Health and Safety Perspective </h3>
<p>There are some risks that everyone should be aware of. From a health and safety perspective, the COVID-19 pandemic remains the number one risk. We are extremely proud of our record last year, where as far as we are aware, not a single COVID-19 spread occurred at our outdoor shows. We think that can be accredited to the combination of a pro-mask culture we all fostered together; the band by performing in masks and the community by vigilantly wearing them and distancing from other groups.  When you come to a show, we ask that you help to continue to set an example and wear a mask, even if it is outdoors and you're just with your quarantine circle.</p>
<p>From a show perspective, one risk that everyone should be aware of is that our ability to perform depends on our ability to maintain our National Parks First Amendment Assembly Permits. However, we established a strong working relationship with the Permits Office over the past year and from our communications with them, we have every reason to believe that the positive partnership between us will continue to grow!</p>

<h3><ol>
<li><span style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""> I want to organize a concert to offer my artistic talents and expand my global presence/brand.</span></li>

</li>
</ol></h3>
<p>YOUR help is what will make this trip possible. </p>
</div><p></p><h3>Let's talk numbers….and PERKS!</h3><ul>
<li>I need to raise a little over $5,000. That may sound like a lot (especially if you don't have it!) BUT it is SO doable with YOUR help. $3,846 will cover the travel package in Ghana and around $1,500 will go towards expenses like passports, travel visa, air fare to the meet-up location (New York), travel insurance, per diem while in Africa, and the great perks! So that's a minimum of $5,000 as the base goal and of course it would be AMAZING to raise more to allow for a buffer.</li>
<li>I just finished a campaign raising 46% of that base goal amount, and have been doing offline fundraising to reach the goal, so I'm re-launching the campaign to fulfill the rest!</li>
<li>There are some pretty awesome PERKS! From speaking to you personally in a 30 min live chat about the trip (and anything else you might want to know) to a DVD of the epic concert, to <i>Project Africa</i> merchandise etc, I'm rolling out great THANK YOU perks to donors…LIKE YOU!</li>

(Please consult your financial advisor to determine if your gift is deductible).</li>

<p>It's hard for some people to imagine leaving their neighborhood, city, or state….let alone their country and continent! We are embarking on a very ambitious journey that will impact the REST OF OUR LIVES.  It's crazy to think that just a $25 donation from you could impact someone's entire life, but it's SO true.

Who am ""I"" exactly?  My name is RAHKUA and I am a creative artist living in Los Angeles, who is passionate about music, health, education, social justice, and LIFE! Check out the recently ended campaign: www.igg.me/at/pala1 Reached 46% :)


What am I doing?  Well, I'm raising funds to go on this Africa trip with a group led by Professors James Smalls and Leonard Jefferies out of New York…. I have a tri-fold plan:

 I want to organize a concert to offer my artistic talents and expand my global presence/brand.

I want to experience the culture, livelihood, art, history, scenery etc. that is Ghana. I want to feel that connection to my ancestors that can only be achieved through immersion into the pulse of the motherland. 


I want to lay the foundations for the expansion of this project to eventually offer a FREE educational/cultural voyage to African American Youth in pursuit of heightened consciousness. Think of it almost like the Birthrite Israel program…giving the opportunity to get back to our roots, to experience a cultural immersion and connect with our history...except that we don’t have a group of affluent, socially and culturally conscious millionaires to fund us like Birthrite Israel…So I am extending our appeal to the people! (And hopefully one of those affluent millionaires finds the page haha).


YOUR help is what will make this trip possible. 
Let's talk numbers….and PERKS!
I need to raise a little over $5,000. That may sound like a lot (especially if you don't have it!) BUT it is SO doable with YOUR help. $3,846 will cover the travel package in Ghana and around $1,500 will go towards expenses like passports, travel visa, air fare to the meet-up location (New York), travel insurance, per diem while in Africa, and the great perks! So that's a minimum of $5,000 as the base goal and of course it would be AMAZING to raise more to allow for a buffer.
I just finished a campaign raising 46% of that base goal amount, and have been doing offline fundraising to reach the goal, so I'm re-launching the campaign to fulfill the rest!
There are some pretty awesome PERKS! From speaking to you personally in a 30 min live chat about the trip (and anything else you might want to know) to a DVD of the epic concert, to Project Africa merchandise etc, I'm rolling out great THANK YOU perks to donors…LIKE YOU!

YOUR GIFTS CAN BE TAX DEDUCTIBLE!  Project Africa is being sponsored by the 501 c3 status non-profit organization, TIFHAP, in line with it's mission to support the arts and education. (Please consult your financial advisor to determine if your gift is deductible).
IF the goal isn't met…NO…let's speak positive energy into this campaign, it WILL happen! (But IF not THIS year, then on next year's voyage) 
The Impact

It's hard for some people to imagine leaving their neighborhood, city, or state….let alone their country and continent! We are embarking on a very ambitious journey that will impact the REST OF OUR LIVES.  It's crazy to think that just a $25 donation from you could impact someone's entire life, but it's SO true. And not only will we get the benefit of the amazing experience, and YOU get the benefit of great gifts and feelings of gratitude, but also the Ghanaian people will get an amazing concert and we'll hopefully be establishing some lifelong connections and changing lives through interpersonal interaction and CARE.

Music Experience – Mentorship/Internship Program
A classroom experience, with the
best trainers in their field, where program participants learn not only music
industry related skills, but other skills necessary to produce an actual
performance. Then they apply what they have learned in working real-life
Mandate Project Impact Inc. music production experiences at jazz and gospel
concerts, and plays.
VISION: A thriving internationally known music industry hub grown
out of the gifts and talents of the urban inner city underrepresented youth;
giving rise to an increase of new and young entrepreneurship within the greater
San Diego area.
VALUES:
The Whole Person – We foster a mentorship/internship program that addresses
mind, body and the essence of who they are.
Discipline and Order – Education is enhanced by a disciplined and orderly
environment.  Those in our mentorship/internship program will reflect
order in their appearance, as we expect kindness, politeness, respect, and
self-discipline.
Excellence - Demonstrated academic achievement is a true basis for
community leadership and gaining access to opportunity. Therefore any young
person, regardless of their GPA, may participate in our mentorship/ internship
program, but we expect high standards of academic achievement and that their
grade level will improve. We recruit outstanding professionals to instruct,
provide learning tools of the highest quality, and encourage those who are in
this program to seek to further their education at the college level,
especially those in high school.
