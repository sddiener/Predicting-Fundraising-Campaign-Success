<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What This Book Is About</strong></p>
<p>“The Seekers: The Secret of the Turtles”  is a mystical tale of a Caribbean princess who sets off on a journey with her best friend and a prince of Barbados to save the sea turtles and calm an active underwater volcano. Along the way, she learns she has an extraordinary future unlike any she ever imagined for herself. The picture only book , titled ""The Seekers"" is the first chapter of ""The Seekers: the Secret of the Turtles"", which captures the beginning of the journey for the young cast.</p>
<p>With a diverse cast of characters, many of whom have mixed heritages, and set in a fantastical setting, young readers will find an array of characters to relate to as the group travels on their mystical adventure.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>About the Author</strong></p>
<p>Cece Younger is a mother, artist and academic. This book is a result of a conversation she had with her 3 year old daughter while putting up the Disney princesses wall decals.  Her daughter asked ""why do all the princesses look like you? Why don’t they look like me?’” Author Cece Younger says. “It broke my heart and from that point I wanted to create kid’s products that reflect diversity of people.”</p>
<p>This project is the second in her plan to write 2 additional books to continue the series and have picture books for each.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>About the Illustrator</strong></p>
<p>Arthur Ella is a cartoon artist who lives in Yaounde, Cameroon. He is a passionate and professional illustrator who holds a national diploma in computer graphics, and many years of experience. He started drawing since his childhood. When he discovered his passion and his talent for drawing, he spent more time doing what he loves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT DOES THE BOOK EDITING AND DESIGN PROCESS ENTAIL?</strong></p>
<p>The following are some of the larger components included:</p>
<p>Layout Design - A custom interior design of a book includes fonts, formatting, and styles used throughout a book. Coming up with a consistent template for each chapter maintains consistency and readability throughout the book. (approx. $2500)</p>
<p>Proofread - A proofreader goes through an edited, formatted book to look for any mistakes in the text, as well as any undesirable design elements. (approx. $500)</p>
<p>Cover Design - Many people judge a book by its cover, so a quality design is important to the quality of the overall book. Cover and back cover design includes marketing copy to tell the book’s story and details such as generating the barcode for selling purposes. (approx. $1000)</p>
<p>Formatting + Publication Costs - Once the manuscript is print-ready, it will be available on Amazon and other book-selling platforms. Each has different requirements and fees associated. Also, the book will need an ISBN and other official components. (approx. $1500)</p>
<p>Printing - Even authors have to pay for their books! Printing costs will cover books ordered through the campaign, as well as an initial run of books to share in marketing and publicity efforts. (approx. $2,500)</p>

<p>For the past 5 years, my team and I have traveled the United States, Canada and Mexico photographing and interviewing teenagers and young adults currently going through cancer treatment, in remission, or who have survived this illness.</p>
<p>Though teens are the most interesting and dynamic of cancer patients, they often fall through the cracks in the cancer world.  Most cancer research funds and other resources are directed towards adults, and next to young children. </p>
<p>The goal of High School Year Book is to create a community in which teens and young adults with cancer can connect and support each other. We are creating a book – being published by Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles - filled with shared stories and the photos of teens going thru cancer.  This book will be given to young people just getting their diagnoses so they can see the stories of other teens who have gone through similar experiences. We are also compiling these stories in a documentary film so that the general public can see how extraordinary these kids become in the face of cancer. </p>
<p>Your contributions will allow us to finish the book and distribute it to those who need it now.  Your donations will also go toward the production of the documentary film.  Both tools will serve as a part of an emotional support system for teenagers and families battling cancer, as well as an educational resource for the broader community.</p>

Your contributions will allow us to finish the book and distribute it to those who need it now.  Your donations will also go toward the production of the documentary film.  Both tools will serve as a part of an emotional support system for teenagers and families battling cancer, as well as an educational resource for the broader community.
Visit our website at www.hsyearbook.org and follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.  Please join these kids and share our pages to help spread our message.
Thank you all!

<h3>Why this book</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Valerio. I started writing <strong>Goodnight Little Princess </strong>in 2016. <br/>I thought illustrating and composing a soundtrack would be the best way to convey this opera in all its entirety, to create a full immersion for the reader. <strong>Goodnight Little Princess</strong> is a tale of a journey that will bring the main character to be aware of himself and the world around him.<br/>There’s a part of us that won’t ever age, constantly in seek of freedom and adventure, this book is a call to nature, a ode to life. </p>

<p>The aim was to be completely drown in another dimension: my grandmother used to read me stories which brought my soul in fields of bravery and marvel and surprise. The best chance to wander with fantasy. </p>

<p>I am a music composer with a passion for literature, cinema and oriental philosophy.

<strong>Our Story at October Hill</strong><p><i>October Hill Magazine </i>is a two-year-old quarterly nonprofit magazine, created for the purpose of providing a platform for new and unpublished authors of short stories and poetry and visual artists. We are keenly aware of how difficult it is today to become published as a first-time author. Therefore, we are passionate in our belief that all new writers deserve an opportunity to have their work considered for publication. We dared to be different. That is why we created the very first literary platform for publication of the works of new and unpublished authors.  </p>
<p>We have been extremely well-received in the literary community. In fact, our readership is growing by leaps and bounds. But with growth comes more costs. We firmly believe that it is time to take our publication to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Our Plans for Growth</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We want to begin paying our all-volunteer staff – most of whom are college students - who have supported our work and made our publication possible for the first two years. They are part and parcel of our success. Furthermore, we consider them to be the next generation of literary editors in training. They deserve to be rewarded.</li>
<li>We plan to launch a print companion to our digital publication. We want to reach a wider readership. Many of our readers have asked for a print magazine. We believe it is time to give them a print publication to hold in their hands and to read at their own leisure, whether on a flight cross country, a subway ride, or an afternoon on the living room couch. This is not inexpensive.</li>
<li>We are already planning our Second Annual Literary Contest for authors of short stories and poetry, even as our first contest draws to a close. Our contests are independently judged and are designed to recognize and reward the very best work of new authors. We are personally putting up $3,500 in prize money.</li>
<li>We ask our writers for revisions! If their work shows promise, we ask the writer to work with us to make the necessary revisions for publication. We give writers the opportunity to be published in a very tough industry, in which most publication offer only a pass or fail option. And our writers are never charged a fee for submitting their work and having it read, or for working with our editors.</li>
<li>We are also planning for the launch of a newsletter for our followers, who wish to remain up-to-date on our quarterly themes, upcoming issues and special projects.</li>
<li>
<i>October Hill Magazine </i>is incorporated as a non-profit in the state of New York and is in the process of applying for 501(c) (3) status from the Internal Revenue Service. This will cost nearly $1,000.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why Your Help Matters</strong></p>
<p>All of our goals will take money. Publishing is not cheap. But we believe firmly in supporting our writers and, in so doing, making sure that the candle light of literature, fiction and poetry continues to burn brightly in the darkness all around us. We believe that publishing new literature and poetry honors the authors who create it and nurtures us all culturally and emotionally.</p>
<p>Who are the writers and artists your contributions will be supporting? They are a global community of aspiring writers who write by day and wait restaurant tables at night; mothers who wearily put their children to sleep and then try to carve out time at night for their writing passion; poets who may teach a class or two and scrape together enough money to attend a writer’s conference in the woods of Vermont. This is how they pursue their craft in the modern economy.</p>
<p>Our publication was founded by Richard Merli, an investigative journalist and editor, who always had a passion for the written word and always harbored a dream of creating a literary magazine. He was joined in his mission by Samantha Morley, a talented young editor who brought ideas, enthusiasm and determination to the mission. For us, it has been a labor of love.</p>
<p>Won’t you join us in making our first ever IndieGoGo campaign a success? Without the support of generous donors, such as you, <i>October Hill Magazine</i> cannot accomplish all of its goals. We will be forever grateful to you for making a contribution to our cause.</p>
<p><strong>Spreading the Word</strong></p>
<p>And if you can’t send any money our way, you can help by spreading the word, asking those who can, to consider making our campaign a success. Please spread the word about this campaign.

</div><p> </p></div>","Our Story at October HillOctober Hill Magazine is a two-year-old quarterly nonprofit magazine, created for the purpose of providing a platform for new and unpublished authors of short stories and poetry and visual artists. We are keenly aware of how difficult it is today to become published as a first-time author. Therefore, we are passionate in our belief that all new writers deserve an opportunity to have their work considered for publication. We dared to be different. That is why we created the very first literary platform for publication of the works of new and unpublished authors.  
We have been extremely well-received in the literary community. In fact, our readership is growing by leaps and bounds. But with growth comes more costs. We firmly believe that it is time to take our publication to the next level.
Our Plans for Growth

We want to begin paying our all-volunteer staff – most of whom are college students - who have supported our work and made our publication possible for the first two years. They are part and parcel of our success. Furthermore, we consider them to be the next generation of literary editors in training. They deserve to be rewarded.
We plan to launch a print companion to our digital publication. We want to reach a wider readership. Many of our readers have asked for a print magazine. We believe it is time to give them a print publication to hold in their hands and to read at their own leisure, whether on a flight cross country, a subway ride, or an afternoon on the living room couch. This is not inexpensive.
We are already planning our Second Annual Literary Contest for authors of short stories and poetry, even as our first contest draws to a close. Our contests are independently judged and are designed to recognize and reward the very best work of new authors. We are personally putting up $3,500 in prize money.
We ask our writers for revisions! If their work shows promise, we ask the writer to work with us to make the necessary revisions for publication. We give writers the opportunity to be published in a very tough industry, in which most publication offer only a pass or fail option. And our writers are never charged a fee for submitting their work and having it read, or for working with our editors.
We are also planning for the launch of a newsletter for our followers, who wish to remain up-to-date on our quarterly themes, upcoming issues and special projects.

October Hill Magazine is incorporated as a non-profit in the state of New York and is in the process of applying for 501(c) (3) status from the Internal Revenue Service. This will cost nearly $1,000.

Why Your Help Matters
All of our goals will take money. Publishing is not cheap. But we believe firmly in supporting our writers and, in so doing, making sure that the candle light of literature, fiction and poetry continues to burn brightly in the darkness all around us. We believe that publishing new literature and poetry honors the authors who create it and nurtures us all culturally and emotionally.
Who are the writers and artists your contributions will be supporting? They are a global community of aspiring writers who write by day and wait restaurant tables at night; mothers who wearily put their children to sleep and then try to carve out time at night for their writing passion; poets who may teach a class or two and scrape together enough money to attend a writer’s conference in the woods of Vermont. This is how they pursue their craft in the modern economy.
Our publication was founded by Richard Merli, an investigative journalist and editor, who always had a passion for the written word and always harbored a dream of creating a literary magazine. He was joined in his mission by Samantha Morley, a talented young editor who brought ideas, enthusiasm and determination to the mission. For us, it has been a labor of love.
Won’t you join us in making our first ever IndieGoGo campaign a success? Without the support of generous donors, such as you, October Hill Magazine cannot accomplish all of its goals. We will be forever grateful to you for making a contribution to our cause.
Spreading the Word
And if you can’t send any money our way, you can help by spreading the word, asking those who can, to consider making our campaign a success. Please spread the word about this campaign. Share it here online, talk about it on social networking sites, or simply tell your friends, neighbors, and family members. Also, visit our official website at https://www.octoberhillmagazine.com/
As always, we wish to thank you for your generous support of October Hill Magazine. And we hope you enjoy reading our upcoming Winter issue, marking the close of our second year!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jo-Ann Richards Goffe, and I’m a Christian Cultural Advocate. My mission is the decolonization of worship spaces. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a Jamaican working in West Africa in 2002-3, helping Christ-followers to use their own languages and music genres in worship, my eyes were gradually opened to the importance of discovering our true identities, and connecting this with God in worship. In fact, I began to realize that this could even potentially lead to a reduction in the crime rate in my home country!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On returning to Jamaica, I had conversations with church and worship leaders, and was encouraged to start a national conversation about the importance of developing culturally relevant expressions of worship. We went one step further, and started a global conversation, a part of which is the KW Magazine: CREWShall Connections in Faith &amp; Culture! The magazine is designed to facilitate conversations about worship and cultural identity among Christ-followers primarily of African heritage in Jamaica, the Caribbean, the African continent and the rest of the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Interviews with singers, authors, dancers and other artists, project features, articles from worship and culture leaders all over the globe, are combined with music scores, poems, devotionals, health tips and a kids story! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are starting out small with just 500 copies. To print 500 copies of the magazine , we will need $2940. Your contributions will help to take the conversations into schools, colleges and churches, and give you a chance to participate as well!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the past, my campaigns have focused on local, Jamaican impact. This project is extending the impact much wider. We are reaching out to connect Christ-followers on the African continent with those in her diasporas all over the world. Whether you are of African heritage or not, or have friends or in-laws who are, it is a truly meaningful project for you to contribute to! Most valuable contributions in this issue of the publication are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Music scores for Jamaican worship songs</li>
<li>Health Corner</li>
<li>Introduction to an amazing teenage gospel artiste from the Caribbean. There is so much to learn from her!</li>
<li>A Bishop's take on raising culturally conscious kids in the UK</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Paul Metsa. I am a Minneapolis based musician, songwriter, author, community activist, and unpublished poet (hoping to change that with this IGG campaign!) I have performed over 6,000 professional gigs, released 12 original recording projects, honored to  have been awarded 8 MN Music Awards, and have performed, participated, and produced hundreds of benefits for a variety of causes. My autobiography Blue Guitar Highway was published by the University of MN Press in 2011, the same university that refused me entrance into their music school years earlier- finally how life works.</p>
<p>My music has been favorably reviewed in the Austin Chronicle, No Depression, Spin Magazine, among others. The Huffington Post referred to me as ""the other great folksinger from Minnesota's Mesabi Iron Range."" Kirkus Review said of Blue Guitar Highway, ""Metsa is as likeable narrator as ever graced a barstool."" I have always loved playing with the English Language in a variety of styles and formats.</p>
<p>I have been writing poetry and free verse for many years. As I celebrate my 40th anniversary of my first gig in Minneapolis in the Fall of 2019, I would love to self publish a book of these poems and verse along with a companion CD of me reading the works backed up by some of the best musicians in Minneapolis, improvising soundscapes to support the poetry. It would be a brand new and exciting artistic avenue for me, and would nicely complement my songs and prose, as well as providing a more intimate glimpse of myself as an artist. The accompanying spoken word CD with improvised music supporting the poems, will also let me experiment with a variety of musicians exploring loops, different instruments (like the Native American flute that accompanies my poem Liquid Heart within the video appearing here) and more. It will also let me work with both my usual musicians, and other great musicians throughout the Twin Cities that I don't get a chance to work with but whose work I love creating new work along the way.</p>

My name is Paul Metsa. I am a Minneapolis based musician, songwriter, author, community activist, and unpublished poet (hoping to change that with this IGG campaign!) I have performed over 6,000 professional gigs, released 12 original recording projects, honored to  have been awarded 8 MN Music Awards, and have performed, participated, and produced hundreds of benefits for a variety of causes. My autobiography Blue Guitar Highway was published by the University of MN Press in 2011, the same university that refused me entrance into their music school years earlier- finally how life works.
My music has been favorably reviewed in the Austin Chronicle, No Depression, Spin Magazine, among others. The Huffington Post referred to me as ""the other great folksinger from Minnesota's Mesabi Iron Range."" Kirkus Review said of Blue Guitar Highway, ""Metsa is as likeable narrator as ever graced a barstool."" I have always loved playing with the English Language in a variety of styles and formats.
I have been writing poetry and free verse for many years. As I celebrate my 40th anniversary of my first gig in Minneapolis in the Fall of 2019, I would love to self publish a book of these poems and verse along with a companion CD of me reading the works backed up by some of the best musicians in Minneapolis, improvising soundscapes to support the poetry. It would be a brand new and exciting artistic avenue for me, and would nicely complement my songs and prose, as well as providing a more intimate glimpse of myself as an artist. The accompanying spoken word CD with improvised music supporting the poems, will also let me experiment with a variety of musicians exploring loops, different instruments (like the Native American flute that accompanies my poem Liquid Heart within the video appearing here) and more. It will also let me work with both my usual musicians, and other great musicians throughout the Twin Cities that I don't get a chance to work with but whose work I love creating new work along the way.
 

What We Need & What You Get
I am hoping to raise $7,500 over 35 days. Here is the cost breakdown: 300 books at $5 per= $ 1.500.  Artwork and Book Editing: $ 750. Studio time to record, mix, and master CD- $750 x 3 =$ 2,250 (that is three full days in the studio.) Musicians- 10 musicians at $150 per musician = $1,500. Replication of 300 CD's w/ artwork- $1,000. Incidentals-$500.
If I don't reach my total goal my priorities would be to get the book done first.
The importance of this particular project for me is to not only extend my artistic reach into poetry (with both the book and the spoken word CD) is that it will give me another avenue to explore in terms of putting on solo shows featuring both the poetry and my music.

<p>Miracle Village is a beautiful coming of age fiction novel set in Haiti. It is a story of family, love, suspense and secrets all wrapped up in rich island culture. </p>
<p>The story itself has been on my heart for years, and I’ve actually already written it in many different ways, however it never felt right. It wasn’t until I went to Haiti on a volunteer missionary trip in 2016 that all the pieces came together for me. </p>
<p>On this trip, I led a workshop on inner beauty and strength for the women in the little town of, Vilaj Mirak, Miracle Village. Miracle Village is a village of survivors, it is filled with resilient people that have shown us that it is possible to start life all over again. Its quaint, colorful, and vibrant aesthetic was the perfect setting for my story. And so, naming the book after this village was inevitable. </p>
<p>I am proud of this novel. I’ve written several stories that I’ve shared with friends and family. However Miracle Village is a story that I believe is worthy to be shared with the world. It is a testament of how Haitian Americans are finally starting to take control of their narratives.</p>
<p>I am so excited to release this work. As a creative independent author, I will need your help to realize my dream. My goal is to raise $5,000 to have the book edited and self published. I am also raising funds to organize the official book launch event which is scheduled for December 1, 2018. </p>
<p>The town of Miracle Village has given me so much hope and inspiration and I would like to return the favor. Therefore a portion of the book sales will be used to aid the people of Miracle Village. </p>
<p>Thank you for helping me accomplish my vision.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Annaleise Winston has never been very good at following rules.</p>
<p>Read Chapter One Here: <a href=""https://kaylajoyartist.wixsite.com/website/post/hoovervilleexclusivechapter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://kaylajoyartist.wixsite.com/website/post/hoovervilleexclusivechapter</a></p>
<p>Set in New York in the summer of 1932, Hooverville tells the story of aristocrat Annaleise Winston, who can never seem to fit in with the Society Girls, the strict rules that govern them, or their selfish indulgence during the midst of the Great Depression. Behind closed doors, her publicly perfect new fiance, Frank Alexander, is violent and dismissive, but without his financial security, Annaleise and her mother will be on the streets. </p>
<p>When Annaleise finally has enough of it all, she runs away and is accidentally stranded in a Hooverville, a lawless homeless encampment in Central Park, where she must keep her identity a secret if she wants to stay safe. But a kind shoe shiner named Thomas Kelley may get in the way of everything she thought she ever wanted. As their love grows, the Great Depression worsens, and Frank will pay any price to bring back his bride.</p>
<p>Hooverville is based on a true story about the Great Depression, The Bonus Army protests, and the homeless camps that scattered the country during the era. <br/> </p>
<p>This is my second book, but the first one that I am publishing. I am overwhelmingly excited to see this book in it's physical form and to see it on shelves and in the hands of readers. I think it's just such an important story that I started almost two years ago, and I intend to see it through.</p>
</div><div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have proof that at five years old I wanted to be a published author, and that dream hasn't faded a single bit. I have chosen to self publish because I don't want to be tied down by a publishing company <i>telling </i>me what I can or cannot write, or <i>telling</i> me that certain scenes or entire plotlines can't be used in the book. <i>Hooverville</i> is my baby, and I want to have creative control over this project until the end, and I would like to own the rights to the characters.</p>
<p>By donating to this project, you'll not only be helping a dream come true, but helping to get a never-before-told story out into the world. Annaleise Winston is a strong heroine who's been compared to Scarlett Ohara and Rose Dewitt Bukater, and she will be a role model for young girls everywhere who read her story.</p>
</div></div>","About Hooverville:
The Good Girl's Guide to Proper Etiquette:DON'T: Dance without a partner.DON'T: Chortle.DON'T: Speak while a man is speaking!DON'T: Reject a Marriage ProposalDON'T: Disappear in the middle of the night.
Annaleise Winston has never been very good at following rules.
Read Chapter One Here: https://kaylajoyartist.wixsite.com/website/post/hoovervilleexclusivechapter
Set in New York in the summer of 1932, Hooverville tells the story of aristocrat Annaleise Winston, who can never seem to fit in with the Society Girls, the strict rules that govern them, or their selfish indulgence during the midst of the Great Depression. Behind closed doors, her publicly perfect new fiance, Frank Alexander, is violent and dismissive, but without his financial security, Annaleise and her mother will be on the streets. 
When Annaleise finally has enough of it all, she runs away and is accidentally stranded in a Hooverville, a lawless homeless encampment in Central Park, where she must keep her identity a secret if she wants to stay safe. But a kind shoe shiner named Thomas Kelley may get in the way of everything she thought she ever wanted. As their love grows, the Great Depression worsens, and Frank will pay any price to bring back his bride.
Hooverville is based on a true story about the Great Depression, The Bonus Army protests, and the homeless camps that scattered the country during the era.  
This is my second book, but the first one that I am publishing. I am overwhelmingly excited to see this book in it's physical form and to see it on shelves and in the hands of readers. I think it's just such an important story that I started almost two years ago, and I intend to see it through.

<h3>About The Secret Eye</h3>
<p>The Secret Eye follows two men who are thrust into service during World War II. There is a marked difference in the motivation of these men as they choose to serve their country. A secret gift to the United States from Great Britain propels the US to a technological advantage that will determine the fate of the war. But, a new threat emerges from Japan, one that will terrorize the US forces in the Pacific. How can America Survive?</p>
<p>I love history and World War 2 has always fascinated me. These young men were our greatest generation. The main character of this book is based on the life of my stepfather Charlie who grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas. He chose to serve in the Navy and become one of the few men to work on America's newest secret weapon.</p>
<p>On the other side of the Pacific Ocean, in the Land of the Rising Sun, a young man struggles to find his way in the world after his father is killed fighting in the Sino-Japanese War. As the oldest, he is exempt from serving during World War 2, but he still serves.</p>
<p>The two men leave everything at home to meet in battle, one armed with terror and the other armed with a secret weapon. Japan will try to win the war using terror, how can America win the war? The Secret Eye.</p>

</p>
<p>Lily was born in Merced, Northern California on February 3, 2013. She
grew up in San Francisco as a companion dog for her Mom, who was not allowed to
work while her Dad was studying. From San Francisco Lily traveled the world.
Lily got her name from the song “Pictures of Lily” after her parents went to
“The Who” concert in Las Vegas. In 2014 the family moved to Cape Town, South
Africa where she had many more experiences. Lily is the only Schnauzer in the
world who has walked a glacier in Alaska and climbed Table Mountain in South
Africa. Lily developed granulomatous meningoencephalitis (GME), a brain
disease, just after her first birthday. GME is a very dangerous sickness for
dogs. Lily was extremely brave, and with the help of a great doctor and the love
of her owners, she recovered from the disease and subsequent chemotherapy and
cortisone treatments. She is now in remission and is back to being the same
cute Schnauzer with a big heart and loads of personality that she was before
her illness. </p>
<p>Three of Lily's books, based on her life, have been published to date. Lily's books have also been translated into French, Spanish and Chinese. How Lily got her bling back is set in Washington Square, San Francisco, and deals with issues related to friendship, jealousy and strangers. Its also introduce children to time capsules. Lily goes to Alaska is a fun story that plays of on a family holiday on Alaska, and deals with fatherly love.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>Steer Goosen developed the concept of the children’s
book series “<i>The Adventures of Lily.</i>”
<i>The Adventures of Lily</i> introduces
children to adventures and traveling through the eyes of Lily, the miniature
Schnauzer. Steer introduces simple facts about the places and characters Lily
encounters, intertwined with little life lessons. Steer is a great believer
that traveling and life experiences are among the most important building
blocks of a person’s education. One should never pass up any opportunity to
gain even the smallest experience. Immersing yourself in different cultures
offers the opportunity to understand others much better and to discover new
perspectives on life, helping to create a class of world citizens through whom
humankind can become united. Life experiences and travel cultivate and
accelerate creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>The merging of fantasy and reality through the use of
actual events in Lily’s life is the canvas for the stories. Backed up with
photographs on the website, it is aimed at making Lily’s character engaging and
identifiable. The website is also interactive, and allows children to share
their stories with their peers on the blog.</p>

</div>
<blockquote>By <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1MUZICKA0N2M5/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Steer Goosen</a> Lily's big personality has crept into the hearts of all her friends in the USA and South Africa, over the first two years of her life. She was nearly taken away through illness, but she remained brave and strong and overcame her sickness, which was associated with chemo treatment and lots of other medication and the side effects thereof. I feel she has a lot of value to offer young children and their parents.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The style of illustrations used in Lily's books help the author to add to the impact of the story by involving the readers imagination. The author also aims to entertain the reader through humor in every scene and throughout the story. The partnership between the illustrator and the author is truly magical, creating a truly immersive experience.</p>

Harpole<br/></a></span></span>Kids stories are often difficult to review, especially because I'm also a children's author. However the concept of seeing the world from Lily's viewpoint (she's a little schnauzer that travels to Alaska) is both humorous &amp; engaging. The pictures are refreshing, simple and creative. The story is fun and makes you want to find out what happens next. Excellent job!</blockquote>
<p></p>

<p>Lily's story inspires children to deal with social issues such as jealousy, friendship, strangers, moving house, parental love, conservation and lots more. Lily's stories are great reads for children of all ages.</p>

The story is fun and Lily is just adorable, we couldn't put it down and HAD to finish it in one sitting. The graphics are perfect for a kids book, no clutter each one just perfect to explain the page (some things need to be left to the child's imagination.)

</div></div>","Lily's story 

Lily was born in Merced, Northern California on February 3, 2013. She
grew up in San Francisco as a companion dog for her Mom, who was not allowed to
work while her Dad was studying. From San Francisco Lily traveled the world.
Lily got her name from the song “Pictures of Lily” after her parents went to
“The Who” concert in Las Vegas. In 2014 the family moved to Cape Town, South
Africa where she had many more experiences. Lily is the only Schnauzer in the
world who has walked a glacier in Alaska and climbed Table Mountain in South
Africa. Lily developed granulomatous meningoencephalitis (GME), a brain
disease, just after her first birthday. GME is a very dangerous sickness for
dogs. Lily was extremely brave, and with the help of a great doctor and the love
of her owners, she recovered from the disease and subsequent chemotherapy and
cortisone treatments. She is now in remission and is back to being the same
cute Schnauzer with a big heart and loads of personality that she was before
her illness. 
Three of Lily's books, based on her life, have been published to date. Lily's books have also been translated into French, Spanish and Chinese. How Lily got her bling back is set in Washington Square, San Francisco, and deals with issues related to friendship, jealousy and strangers. Its also introduce children to time capsules. Lily goes to Alaska is a fun story that plays of on a family holiday on Alaska, and deals with fatherly love.

Two other titles, dealing with Lily's move to a far of land away from her friends and brave Lily going to hospital, will be released in April and May. 


Lily's ABC Safari has been published on the 1st of March as an iBook, with othe platforms following shortly. The e-book exposes a younger generation to the adventures of Lily. The book is a fresh approach to learning the alphabet, and is definitely not your typical ""A"" is for Apple type book. Lily introduces her friends to wild animals that you get while on Safari in Africa, thus adding another level of learning, as it makes children aware of some endangered species, and introduces conservation at a younger age. Lily's ABC Safari has already been funded, but now we want to create a more engaging and quality experience for our young readers, by creating an animated e-book with your help.  

About the author


Steer Goosen developed the concept of the children’s
book series “The Adventures of Lily.”
The Adventures of Lily introduces
children to adventures and traveling through the eyes of Lily, the miniature
Schnauzer. Steer introduces simple facts about the places and characters Lily
encounters, intertwined with little life lessons. Steer is a great believer
that traveling and life experiences are among the most important building
blocks of a person’s education. One should never pass up any opportunity to
gain even the smallest experience. Immersing yourself in different cultures
offers the opportunity to understand others much better and to discover new
perspectives on life, helping to create a class of world citizens through whom
humankind can become united. Life experiences and travel cultivate and
accelerate creativity and innovation.
The merging of fantasy and reality through the use of
actual events in Lily’s life is the canvas for the stories. Backed up with
photographs on the website, it is aimed at making Lily’s character engaging and
identifiable. The website is also interactive, and allows children to share
their stories with their peers on the blog.




The Impact


By Steer Goosen Lily's big personality has crept into the hearts of all her friends in the USA and South Africa, over the first two years of her life. She was nearly taken away through illness, but she remained brave and strong and overcame her sickness, which was associated with chemo treatment and lots of other medication and the side effects thereof. I feel she has a lot of value to offer young children and their parents.

The style of illustrations used in Lily's books help the author to add to the impact of the story by involving the readers imagination. The author also aims to entertain the reader through humor in every scene and throughout the story. The partnership between the illustrator and the author is truly magical, creating a truly immersive experience.


By Scott R. HarpoleKids stories are often difficult to review, especially because I'm also a children's author. However the concept of seeing the world from Lily's viewpoint (she's a little schnauzer that travels to Alaska) is both humorous & engaging. The pictures are refreshing, simple and creative. The story is fun and makes you want to find out what happens next. Excellent job!


Lily's story inspires children to deal with social issues such as jealousy, friendship, strangers, moving house, parental love, conservation and lots more. Lily's stories are great reads for children of all ages.


By Deon TerBlancheFantastic kids book, we enjoyed every moment of it. The story is fun and Lily is just adorable, we couldn't put it down and HAD to finish it in one sitting. The graphics are perfect for a kids book, no clutter each one just perfect to explain the page (some things need to be left to the child's imagination.) I can recommend this book to kids of ""all"" ages, I loved it and I am 48 years old!

Below are some of the illustrations taken from ""How Lily got her bling back"" and ""Lily goes to Alaska"". (Text omitted)

<h3>What Is It?</h3>
<h4><b><i>“Alone (In My Room)”</i> </b></h4>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">is my latest endeavor as an author, it’s a narrative story using the mediums of poetry, prose, journals, jokes, visual art to tell the story about me and my experiences, perspectives, understandings that occur what is intended to be conveniently the ‘safest’ where I am my true self and unmitigated by immediate influences of the world that lies out the four walls that know me the best. It is a journey of love, pain, joy that deals with issues of beautiful and tragic experiences that occur in it’s purest stream. I am honestly scared of hell of putting this book out because of the potentially vulnerability that I accept but I also understand there is a lot of power in vulnerability and that sometimes the most effective art scares the artist but here I am depending on my community to help me fulfill my dream of producing a project that means a lot to me. </span></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Two years ago, I produced a small chapbook ""I Grew Up Right Beside"", a simple project but a little harder to produce than I expected. A beautiful experience giving my art to the world and to get a great response. While I creating IGURBY I wanted to share experiences about my growth, particular growth that goes unnoticed or unacknowledged, the gradual and sharp growth using the theme of how I viewed the through experiences of love and blackness. Through that project, it helped me connect with other people sharing experiences about their and I was able to find a connection by building with our differences and similarities often with people that I did not know I could create such a connection with. That inspired to realize that things that are happening right beside me that goes unnoticed with helped me start a continual social engagement art project which takes the stories of the people that are right beside you and reflect them artistically. The Right Beside You staple is an annual concert that reflects the experiences using podcasts, photography and engaging that live music and poetry. I won't to do the same thing with Alone In My Room under the Right Beside You umbrella and igniting engagement around the topics of solitude and how we view ourselves using different mediums such travelling workshops, concerts and instructional material. <br/>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>Like how my homeboys would say back in the day when addressing the condition of their daily livelihood, ""it's hard outchere, mang""</div>
<div><p>As an artist, there is a
lot of risk in self-publishing a book. Especially financial risk and it’s not
easy. There’s a lot that goes into making a project that it is effective and
wide-reaching. I have learned this first hand in my project, “I Grew Up Right
Beside You”, although it was a small project, there was a lot of energy that
goes into it even after the actual text of the project is complete. I want this
book to reach people and as well be more than just a book but a gateway to many
things that help us with the discussion of “solitude”. I am learning to ask for help and even asking for help is a lot of me but I need help if I want to the things that I want to do this summer and that includes producing this book and as well as completing my studio able for my Right Beside You social engagement project and they canvasing the for the 3rd Annual ""Right Beside You"" concert and I usually pay out of pocket for a lot of these things and I can easily go into debt and I don't to do that. As corny as it seems, it's not about making money for me, it's about effecting people and not lose while effecting people. </p></div>

You sing: 
I got what you want (got what you want)I got what you need (got what you need)Can I get another shotThis time I'ma make it hot
Aight, good that's beautiful singing. 
I reply;
A Ton + Andre 3Stacks Benjamin
(Andre 3Stacks ($3000) + A ton ($2000) = $5000)
I could have easily just said $5000 but I like to make things complicated. Anyways, self-publishing is not an easy task and a lot of things go into making a wonderful a lot that stuff after the book is written. Funds will be used in this manner: 




- 
Copy
Editing


- 
Printing
(It cost to print with good material. Like yea, for real)


- 
Cover
Design


- 
Artwork


- 
Launch
Party


- 
Book
Formatting / Layout


-  Marketing

- Promotional Merchandise


Risks & Challenges
Like how my homeboys would say back in the day when addressing the condition of their daily livelihood, ""it's hard outchere, mang""
As an artist, there is a
lot of risk in self-publishing a book. Especially financial risk and it’s not
easy. There’s a lot that goes into making a project that it is effective and
wide-reaching. I have learned this first hand in my project, “I Grew Up Right
Beside You”, although it was a small project, there was a lot of energy that
goes into it even after the actual text of the project is complete. I want this
book to reach people and as well be more than just a book but a gateway to many
things that help us with the discussion of “solitude”. I am learning to ask for help and even asking for help is a lot of me but I need help if I want to the things that I want to do this summer and that includes producing this book and as well as completing my studio able for my Right Beside You social engagement project and they canvasing the for the 3rd Annual ""Right Beside You"" concert and I usually pay out of pocket for a lot of these things and I can easily go into debt and I don't to do that. As corny as it seems, it's not about making money for me, it's about effecting people and not lose while effecting people. 

Perks

Various perks are listed and that includes autographed merchandise, free entry to events, handwritten letters and commissioned personal poems.

which is located in the Western Lopit Mountains, South Sudan - a 
peaceful, yet undeveloped area. Lopit community members (20) now living 
in Australia have outlined and are implementing an action plan, starting
 with the goal to end avoidable death and suffering for mothers and 
children during birth.<br/><br/>The mortality rate in the Lopit Mountains 
is currently 1 out of 7 women during childbirth, and 35% of children 
before  reaching age 5. Your contribution will significantly lower this 
rate.<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>In part 1 of this campaign, we raised USD540. It's a start!  This amount will be directed to purchasing basic building materials and equipment. The bricks are ready and land (500mtrs X 450mtrs) is allocated. 
The next stage is to buy the cement and build the center. Then the 
roof.. etc.,  and we will continue, using all funds received to build 
each of the next stages.  <br/><br/>Here's a list of materials and equipment needed:<br/><br/><ul><li>$10,000 - Basic construction materials<br/>Cement, iron sheets, timbers, 
wheelbarrow, metal spades, roofing nails, big nails,  doors, H2 water 
tanks, fencing and barbed wire, jembe, axe, hammer, panga, tables,

 education in Longiro. Approximately 200 children are currently learning
 English in an outdoor classroom.<br/><br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Primarily, you will help to reduce the mortality rate for 57 villages in
 the region. Also, drive the building of schools, establishing rehabilitation centers for 
people suffering from Leprosy, developing farming and agriculture to 
improve food security and establish financial sustainability. 
</p>
<p>Several NGO's are operating aid projects in the Lopit Mountains. 
These include UNICEF, Save The Children, Norwegian Church Aid and 
Association for Aid &amp; Relief, Japan. Your contribution will 
encourage and help to stimulate all efforts.
</p>
<p>By contributing, you will play an important role in helping save and give life to people in the Lopit.</p>
<br/><h3>What has been done so far</h3>The project is being driven and 
implemented by the Lopit Community itself. Primarily, it is the determination of the people from Lopit to help their motherland. <br/><p><br/>For at least a couple of years, the Lopit Community in Australia has 
been building its network, presenting the situation to various 
organisations and is receiving ongoing support. As a result of these 
efforts in 2012, a 40' container of supplies was loaded in Melbourne and
 shipped to the Lopit Mountains. It contained: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Clothing for children and adults </li>
<li>Shoes, boots and sandals</li>
<li>Food items (including rice, lentils, milk powder, beans, tuna, oil, sugar; wheat flour; other non-perishable goods)</li>
<li>Medical supplies</li>
<li>Kitchenware (cooking utensils and pots, bowls and cups)</li>
<li>Bedding (sheets and blankets)</li>
<li>Cloth/fabric (of any sort, that can be made into clothing)</li>
<li>Mosquito nets</li>
<li>Sewing machines (treadle machines, not electric)</li>
<li>Organic seed for grain and vegetable crops</li>
<li>Hand tools for agriculture and also for building</li>
<li>Soap</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, visit <a href=""https://hnhproject.wordpress.com/page/3/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://hnhproject.wordpress.com/page/3/</a>
</p>The Lopit Community in Australia raised an initial $8,000 and sent 3
 representatives to the Lopit area to assess the situation and return 
with their findings. This entire project is based on moving in the 
direction of development as determined by the Lopit people, and coupled 
with support garnered in Australia and partnerships established with 
international organisations, are major factors for overcoming hurdles along the way.<br/><br/> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>The violence that erupted on 15 December 2013 between armed forces
loyal to President Salva Kiir and armed forces loyal to Former Vice President Riek
Machar in Juba, the capital city of South Sudan, has resulted in numerous challenges
to government programs, including reform of the country's poor healthcare
system.</p>
<p>Despite making significant gains in promoting awareness of
health and wellness in South Sudan, preventable diseases remain a serious
issue. Malaria is one of the country's biggest problems, with thousands of
children dying daily from this treatable disease. Although rates of HIV and
AIDS infection have slowed in recent years, many families are impacted by these
serious conditions. 
</p>
<p>Also poor sanitation in the  Lopit Mountain areas and the lack of
affordable medication further contributes to the spread of disease, and many women
and children do not have access to even basic medical treatment.</p>A 
key challenge will be to provide  trained healthcare  staff and/ or 
volunteers on the ground. Although there's lots of goodwill for 
providing this support, it is yet to be confirmed. <br/><br/>Another challenge will be to ensure that equipment shipped can be 
used and ongoing supply sustained. Plans to develop agriculture as a 
means for building sustainability are also in the initiative stage.<br/><br/>A variety of approaches for solving these challenges and saving lives in Lopit region include:<br/><ul>
<li>Major health interventions will work even in the poorest remote 
areas of Lopit by building healthcare and schools facilities across the 
region and train members of Lopit community to manage the system and providing universal healthcare access to all women and children.</li>
<li>Involvement of volunteers from around the world will play a 
significant role in lowering the mortality rate in the peaceful region of 
Lopit Mountain. Your involvement as a volunteer is very important to set
 a good example that will lead to success for  locals to follow.</li>
<li>Introduction of programs in many forms, e.g, health awareness, 
workshops across the region and adequate funding from both international
 and local sources for improving women and children’s access to 
healthcare and education. </li>
<li>Good management on the ground and effective use of information will 
decrease the risk of infection to slow down the spread and decreasing 
vulnerability to reduce risk and impact. Sustainable donor funding will 
save lives and money</li>
<li>Partnerships with Lopit community, NGOs, and private companies can be powerful.</li>
</ul>

By contributing, you will play an important role in helping save and give life to people in the Lopit.
What has been done so farThe project is being driven and 
implemented by the Lopit Community itself. Primarily, it is the determination of the people from Lopit to help their motherland. For at least a couple of years, the Lopit Community in Australia has 
been building its network, presenting the situation to various 
organisations and is receiving ongoing support. As a result of these 
efforts in 2012, a 40' container of supplies was loaded in Melbourne and
 shipped to the Lopit Mountains. It contained: 


Clothing for children and adults 
Shoes, boots and sandals
Food items (including rice, lentils, milk powder, beans, tuna, oil, sugar; wheat flour; other non-perishable goods)
Medical supplies
Kitchenware (cooking utensils and pots, bowls and cups)
Bedding (sheets and blankets)
Cloth/fabric (of any sort, that can be made into clothing)
Mosquito nets
Sewing machines (treadle machines, not electric)
Organic seed for grain and vegetable crops
Hand tools for agriculture and also for building
Soap

The Lopit Community in Australia raised an initial $8,000 and sent 3
 representatives to the Lopit area to assess the situation and return 
with their findings. This entire project is based on moving in the 
direction of development as determined by the Lopit people, and coupled 
with support garnered in Australia and partnerships established with 
international organisations, are major factors for overcoming hurdles along the way.   Risks & Challenges  
The violence that erupted on 15 December 2013 between armed forces
loyal to President Salva Kiir and armed forces loyal to Former Vice President Riek
Machar in Juba, the capital city of South Sudan, has resulted in numerous challenges
to government programs, including reform of the country's poor healthcare
system.
Despite making significant gains in promoting awareness of
health and wellness in South Sudan, preventable diseases remain a serious
issue. Malaria is one of the country's biggest problems, with thousands of
children dying daily from this treatable disease. Although rates of HIV and
AIDS infection have slowed in recent years, many families are impacted by these
serious conditions. 

Also poor sanitation in the  Lopit Mountain areas and the lack of
affordable medication further contributes to the spread of disease, and many women
and children do not have access to even basic medical treatment.A 
key challenge will be to provide  trained healthcare  staff and/ or 
volunteers on the ground. Although there's lots of goodwill for 
providing this support, it is yet to be confirmed. Another challenge will be to ensure that equipment shipped can be 
used and ongoing supply sustained. Plans to develop agriculture as a 
means for building sustainability are also in the initiative stage.A variety of approaches for solving these challenges and saving lives in Lopit region include:
Major health interventions will work even in the poorest remote 
areas of Lopit by building healthcare and schools facilities across the 
region and train members of Lopit community to manage the system and providing universal healthcare access to all women and children.
Involvement of volunteers from around the world will play a 
significant role in lowering the mortality rate in the peaceful region of 
Lopit Mountain. Your involvement as a volunteer is very important to set
 a good example that will lead to success for  locals to follow.
Introduction of programs in many forms, e.g, health awareness, 
workshops across the region and adequate funding from both international
 and local sources for improving women and children’s access to 
healthcare and education. 
Good management on the ground and effective use of information will 
decrease the risk of infection to slow down the spread and decreasing 
vulnerability to reduce risk and impact. Sustainable donor funding will 
save lives and money
Partnerships with Lopit community, NGOs, and private companies can be powerful.

<p>I’m Sarai Johnson, entrepreneur,
#1 Amazon Best Selling author, speaker and regular old person with a bunch of
sexual baggage. Just like almost everybody.</p>
<p>Why should you care
about my specific baggage? Here are several reasons to consider:</p>
<p>1.<span> 
</span>Everybody loves to
play voyeur sometimes. Plus, maybe my baggage is worse than your baggage, and
wouldn’t that make you feel better about yourself? </p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span>My baggage includes a
whole lot of religious detritus and that’s pretty darn interesting on a
socio-political level. </p>
<p>3.<span> 
</span>As a society, at
large, we need to have an honest conversation about rape culture. I mean, a
really honest one. Not one that’s like, “I’m a feminist and this is a
definition of something here and your definition is wrong!” or like, “I’m a guy
and I’m nice and so you should just be grateful for how nice I am!” or other
crap like that. Let’s talk. For real.</p>
<p>Here’s my deal. On the
verge of my 35th birthday, and just after achieving my 8th year of marriage, my
life blew up. As a mother of two, a wife, an accomplished professional, a
worship leader at my church, and now, an entrepreneur, I suddenly found myself
the victim of a bizarre sexual assault. It happened while I was traveling for
business, and it disrupted my whole world. It rattled my sense of self,
challenged my concept of security and wholeness, and shook me to the core. </p>
<p>As I started to pick
up the pieces, however, I realized that this event was so powerful and
significant it had the potential to break up a shell I had unconsciously built
around myself. It threatened (<i>promised</i>)
to tear down the tower of external definitions of who I <b>thought I was supposed to be</b>, which I had created over years and
years without really stopping to consider the choices I was making along the
way. </p>
<p>The assault lanced a
wound I didn’t know I was carrying with me. It revealed a crack in my
foundation so deep, and so brittle, that I knew I had no choice but to go down
to the studs of my life to rebuild. I knew that I could never move forward, to
live as the person I know I am, to accomplish the big work I know I have to
accomplish, unless I found strength in spite of what felt and looked like a
major fault line. </p>
<p>This journey of mine
back through time has been filled with tenderness, sadness, beauty, pain, and,
mercifully for me (and now you) a good amount of hilarity.</p>
<p>All told, this story
deserves to be told because it is messy, beautiful and meaningful. It touches
on universal themes and experiences of love, loss, self-loathing, redemption
and freedom. It’s a story of me, all the boys I’ve loved or tried to love, and,
chances are, it’s a little bit about you too. It’s about our children. It’s
about how we can create true connection and healing between masculine and
feminine people to get to a better place of understanding and healing. </p>
<p>Sexual assault, rape,
coercion, manipulation and abuse abound in our world, in our culture, between
men and women and in many other relationships. We don’t deserve to be treated <i>or</i> to treat each other this way. So, let’s
get our shit together and stop being jerks. This book is one small step toward
getting there. </p>
<p>This book is a launch pad
for a big conversation. I want to talk about sexual assault and how to NOT rape
people all around the country. I want to engage this conversation so that women
will be free to say “NO” and be heard, and so men will be free to hold space
for themselves and their partners. So they will be confident to connect with
women without fear or self-doubt. I don’t think this issue is an “us against
them” kind of thing. It’s much bigger than that – and the only way to heal that
gap is to come together and work toward understanding and love.</p>
<p><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>I’ve self-published
before, and it was easy-peasy. I wrote a book, made sure there were no major
typos, and published it on Kindle, lickety split. This book is different. It’s
my soul on pages. It’s a great-big-huge important message. It needs to be not
just <i>good,</i> but brilliant and amazing!
Thus, I need a real, live editor. A designer. A bunch of paperbacks to
distribute far and wide. </p>
<p>I’m looking to raise a
cool $7500 with this campaign which will be used as follows: </p>
<p>$2700 for a genius
book coach/editor who will help me whip this tome into shape</p>
<p>$3000 for printing and
shipping real, live, physical books </p>
<p>$1000 for promotion
and firestarting </p>
<p>$800 for copyediting
and design</p>
<p><b>The Perks</b></p>
<p>Even though I know you’re
altruistic, you still deserve a little cred for giving your energy and cold,
hard cash to something like this. A couple of the cool things you can expect
for providing various levels of support for this campaign include: </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>An advance copy of the
e-book <i>before </i>the October publication
date</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>An autographed copy of
the paperback </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>An audio version of
the book</p>
<p>Pretty exciting stuff,
I know. Try to contain yourself. 

</p>
<p><span>If I don’t raise the
entire goal, I’ll shut this campaign down and start all over again because I
will not be stopped. Nay! I shall rise above a failed Indiegogo campaign and do
another one until I have enough to publish this doggone book! Save the internet
the pain of me nagging forever and ever, and just support it now. Is this
blackmail? Coercion? I’m not sure, but I’m pretty determined and I won’t go
away.</span></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>This project is
something that has the potential to shift beliefs and behaviors toward
reconciliation and love between the masculine and feminine realms. It’s an
opportunity for many people to seek healing through walking along with me
through my journey, and perhaps, to be inspired to walk through their own with
eyes and heart wide open. It’s a chance to start a conversation to bring
understanding and light to a dark, dark place. </p>
<p>This is something I’m
equipped to do because I have a long history of speaking up and saying what
others won’t in a way that brings about change. Fun fact: my name means “argumentative
and contentious” and I live up to it every single day. Ask my beleaguered friends
and relatives, and they’ll vouch for me on that front with a sigh and a roll of
the eyes. </p>
<p>In all seriousness, after
spending years working in nonprofits, bringing about collaborative efforts for
change and contributing to community progress on many fronts, I’m ready to do
the same at the interpersonal level. I’m ready to address the challenges of
sexual power dynamics, of religious oppression of women, and the confusion men
often face when they are faced with allegations of sexual misconduct. </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>This book has been
fully drafted and is currently undergoing revision and perfecting. The biggest
challenges I have in front of me today, right this minute, are my strong
distaste for internet trolls and my unwillingness to use the new app Periscope.
</p>
<p>To overcome these
issues, I’ll grow a thicker skin and start collecting hilarious comebacks and
or the serenity to not engage with trolls. As for Periscope, I’m still working
to master Twitter, so, first things first. </p>
<p>Overall, my life is
full of examples of overcoming obstacles to make the impossible happen. I’ll do
it again and again. This is no different. Wait. This <i>is </i>different because I care about it so deeply and passionately
that I can’t imagine a scenario in which it <i>doesn’t
</i>happen. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>

<p>My name is Victoria Pope and I am a self-published author living in Montreal, QC. I have released two books so far, with a third book on the way in the Action-Erotica genre. Now...</p>
<p>At this point you're probably wondering why on Earth I have started a crowd-funding campaign, and why I would need it. So I'm about to tear off the scab and show you just how vulnerable a lowly self-publishing author's life can get.</p>
<p>There are of course dozens of success stories of  men and women who are able to spew out hundreds of books and have the privilege of making a living off it. Never mind the fodder readily available for every hormonal tween and sexually-deprived person on the planet, there are literally thousands of authors from every genre, background and education level that are able to achieve what millions of us are so desperate to do. To <i>make </i>it. </p>
<p>Ever since I was a kid I wanted to be a movie director. My mother spent thousands of her hard-earned cash to put me through film school, but I, like so many others in my position, was unable to find an <i>in </i>into the industry, and the rent was due. I ended up working as an office drone for the preceding seven years, always returning home with a yearning to just tell stories. It wasn't until two years ago that I gave it a real shot and just started writing. Not scripts or screenplays, but an actual novel. I stuck with the genres that I love most, for I truly wanted to write something that I personally would not be able to put down. And for those of you that know me personally, you'll know that there are two genres that get my heart pumping with wild fervor.  Sex. and Action.</p>
<p>So I wrote and I wrote, and it didn't matter that I had no idea how to obtain a publishing contract, or even a literary agent, I just wrote for the hell of it, and when I typed the last period of my first novel I sat back and smiled, completely proud of myself. I did my research and decided to go the self-publishing route, even designed my first cover, and two months later, my imagination was officially for sale on Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble. I was so excited, absolutely convinced that I would be able to do this full-time by the end of the year. <br/></p>
<p>But you can guess what happened next right?</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Hello Generous World!
My name is Victoria Pope and I am a self-published author living in Montreal, QC. I have released two books so far, with a third book on the way in the Action-Erotica genre. Now...
At this point you're probably wondering why on Earth I have started a crowd-funding campaign, and why I would need it. So I'm about to tear off the scab and show you just how vulnerable a lowly self-publishing author's life can get.
There are of course dozens of success stories of  men and women who are able to spew out hundreds of books and have the privilege of making a living off it. Never mind the fodder readily available for every hormonal tween and sexually-deprived person on the planet, there are literally thousands of authors from every genre, background and education level that are able to achieve what millions of us are so desperate to do. To make it. 
Ever since I was a kid I wanted to be a movie director. My mother spent thousands of her hard-earned cash to put me through film school, but I, like so many others in my position, was unable to find an in into the industry, and the rent was due. I ended up working as an office drone for the preceding seven years, always returning home with a yearning to just tell stories. It wasn't until two years ago that I gave it a real shot and just started writing. Not scripts or screenplays, but an actual novel. I stuck with the genres that I love most, for I truly wanted to write something that I personally would not be able to put down. And for those of you that know me personally, you'll know that there are two genres that get my heart pumping with wild fervor.  Sex. and Action.
So I wrote and I wrote, and it didn't matter that I had no idea how to obtain a publishing contract, or even a literary agent, I just wrote for the hell of it, and when I typed the last period of my first novel I sat back and smiled, completely proud of myself. I did my research and decided to go the self-publishing route, even designed my first cover, and two months later, my imagination was officially for sale on Amazon and Barnes & Noble. I was so excited, absolutely convinced that I would be able to do this full-time by the end of the year. 
But you can guess what happened next right?
With little time and no money for marketing or campaigning, my book did not sell the thousands of copies my naivete envisioned. But I still pressed on and wrote another, this time having it edited by a real copy-editor and the cover designed by a professional. Still, the sales have tanked.
The most frustrating part is...this is my dream, what I want to do. I want to tell stories. I don't want to be a waitress or a data entry clerk. I want to entertain YOU!
I am asking the world to give me TWO MONTHS of stress and debt-free time to finish my fourth book and campaign the ever-loving crap out of myself and my books so we can see another young soul achieve their goals. 

  What We Need & What You Get The $4000 CAD I am asking for is very simply, to cover my expenses for two months. This includes my rent, phone and internet bills, as well as food. This will be able to let me write every day as my actual job. Can you imagine?
For every person that donates, I am willing to give a free copy of my books, whichever ones they choose! 
If I do not make my goal, it will at least help me pay off some of the debt I have racked up to pay for the editor and book cover designer. It will also help finance the next few projects I have lined up (they will just take much longer.)
  The ImpactTo be honest, two months of writing every day could be THE difference it would take to set me on my way for the REST OF MY LIFE. You never know what you can achieve if you're able to focus on your dreams and forget about the stressful distractions that come with every day life like finding menial jobs you hate that barely pay rent, or the sheer sadness of not being able to do what it is you wake up for.I am relying on the kindness of strangers to help me live my dreams.

<p>Kitchen Common Sense is an all-inclusive guide that cuts
down all the magic of professional cooking technique that can make
cooking for yourself seem complicated and time-consuming.  </p>
<p><b>Who Are We?</b></p>
<p>I’m Justin!  I have
been a professional cook for over 7 years now. 
I’ve worked in numerous kitchens all across Los Angeles, gathering
technique, tips, and pointers from some of LA’s best chefs from places like
Fleming’s Steakhouse, Tender Greens, 
Picca, and Nobu.  </p>
<p>And I’m Liz!  I’m a
NYU graduate-turned-restaurant supervisor who has been unknowingly struggling
in the kitchen for years.  That was until
I met Justin during our years working at Nobu Los Angeles together.  </p>
<p><b>Why Did We Write KCS?</b></p><p>For years, we’ve watched so many of our friends and family
begin to take on “healthier” lifestyles. 
Nowadays, the mindset in LA is revolving around everything Organic and
All-Natural, and if you’re not in some sort of group fitness class, then you
might as well be chowing down on Mickey D’s every night.  But living healthfully can be expensive and
tedious, especially when you don’t know your way around the kitchen.  Buying meals from places that tout fresh and
delicious foods for every meal can really put a dent in your wallet.</p>
<p>Everyone around us seemed to want to cook for themselves, but
claimed they didn’t know how or didn’t have the time to do it.  After a few years of working doubles and
overtime, while having others ask for tips to help make cooking at home easier,
we finally came up with an answer.  That
answer is Kitchen Common Sense. </p>

As I type this, the major media networks are hiring small armies of campaign reporters to follow the candidates around from stump speech to stump speech, scrutinizing their every movement and mining their statements for some slip of the tongue that can be turned into ratings gold.

<p>Like many Americans, I have grown tired of ingesting a brand of campaign coverage that shuffles off important policy discussion and public inquiry for a seemingly endless stream of idiotic commentary and surface-level reporting. However, unlike most Americans, I have been running a progressively-oriented news site, <a href=""http://virallysuppressed.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Virally Suppressed</a>, for the past three and a half years and have created an Indiegogo campaign in the hopes that I might add something worthwhile to the swirling maelstrom of crap coverage that we are inundated with, day in and day out.<br/></p>
<p>It is my hope that, in the coming weeks and months, I will be able provide my readers with presidential campaign coverage that focuses on the struggles and desires of the American people, rather than regurgitating the canned statements of the candidates who purport to represent them.

<p>I don't want to waste your time or mine by highlighting every absurd, xenophobic comment uttered by a Donald Trump or a Mike Huckabee. However, I do want to talk to the supporters of those candidates to try and find out what it is in those comments that resonates with them. At the same time, I have no desire to stoke the already roaring fires of discontent between the supporters of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton with inflammatory invective or lopsided coverage of one side over the other, instead preferring to look at both the similarities and the differences of their policy positions and attempting to find the source of the passion and antagonism in both camps.</p>
<p>Now, this doesn't mean I plan to be ""objective"" in my reporting. As far as I'm concerned, objectivity is a delusional fever dream cooked up by journalism professors and newspaper editorial boards to blot out the stone cold fact that our personal biases and opinions impact everything that we write.

As such, a hypothetical outline of what your funding would go to support would look something like:</p> <ul> <li>$800 towards gasoline, which at an average cost of $2.50/gal in my Corolla that gets about 29 mpg, projects out to a little over 9,000 miles of driving. That would provide me with enough gas to go to Iowa twice, New Hampshire and South Carolina and Wisconsin once, with about 2,000 miles leftover to go to at least one more state. Of course, since I'll be trying to make the most out of that mileage, I'll be trying to spend a good deal of time in each state, which means I need...</li> <li>$550 for lodging. While I will try to save resources by staying with friends or couch surfing, that isn't always possible--especially in rural Iowa.

In all likelihood, the 2016 US Presidential Election will be the most heavily covered, overly analyzed election in the country's history.

<h3>If you believe...</h3>
<ul>
<li>that it takes a village to raise a child</li>
<li>in indie companies with strong missions</li>
<li>that true diversity matters</li>
<li>in platforms for &amp; about voices that have traditionally been under- or misrepresented</li>
<li>that our kids should be part of global conversations so we can raise responsible citizens</li>
<li>in bringing back important voices from the past</li>
<li>in raising up all voices so that we can rise up together</li>
</ul>
<p>Then consider contributing! Our mission is to publish children's literature that reflects the diverse realities of the world we live in, both at home and abroad. This means seeking out books by &amp; about people &amp; subjects that speak to a broad range of human experience, raising up each other's voices so that we can rise up together.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>$25,000 will <strong>create opportunities for authors to travel for workshops, panels &amp; readings for their books.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<b>$50,000 </b>will give us the resources to <strong>acquire</strong> important books from the States and around the world and <strong>aid in advertising efforts</strong> that are paramount to the life of a book. It will also help us to establish <strong>partnerships</strong> with organizations doing good work: our goal is to donate portions of proceeds of at least one book a year to a different partner organization.</li>
<li>
<strong>$75,000</strong> will allow us to hire a part-time publicist who understands our mission and helps us achieve it. We are two people, and we don't have all the resources we need to make sure Penny Candy Books is a true force for change in the world. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Current &amp; Future Books</h3>
<p>Our first three books &amp; their authors &amp; illustrators need your help to find the audiences they deserve:</p>
<p><strong><i>A Gift from Greensboro</i></strong> is at once an elegy, a celebration of the magic of childhood friendship and adventure, and a meditation on growing up in the wake of the sit-ins that ushered in the Civil Rights Movement. Paired with intricate, brimming-with-life illustrations, this poem recognizes that true friendship knows no boundaries, and this is the true gift from Greensboro. </p>

<p><strong><i>The Not In Here Story</i></strong>. In this heartwarming adoption story, the Seeks set out to start a family but soon discover it's not going to be easy. So they embark on a journey that takes them through the desert, mountains, and jungle only to find that they didn’t have to travel so far and so wide to find a child to love after all.  </p>

<p>Part girl-power, part cautionary tale, <i><strong>The Hunt</strong>, </i>by Margaux Othats, is a wordless picture book that chronicles a young girl who builds and rebuilds a rock sculpture as two hunters repeatedly shoot her creation to bits. As the girl perseveres, what she creates becomes a testament to the creative spirit and a condemnation of violence. </p>
<h3>Upcoming Titles</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help us usher our new titles into the world. <strong>We are working on publishing books from Australia, France, Japan, Palestine, and the US about subjects ranging from understanding death to girl power to human connectedness.</strong> We're developing a truly exciting <strong>family</strong> of authors &amp; illustrators with diverse backgrounds and important stories to tell. </p>

Primordial Soup 2:

_____________
If you believe...

that it takes a village to raise a child
in indie companies with strong missions
that true diversity matters
in platforms for & about voices that have traditionally been under- or misrepresented
that our kids should be part of global conversations so we can raise responsible citizens
in bringing back important voices from the past
in raising up all voices so that we can rise up together

Then consider contributing! Our mission is to publish children's literature that reflects the diverse realities of the world we live in, both at home and abroad. This means seeking out books by & about people & subjects that speak to a broad range of human experience, raising up each other's voices so that we can rise up together.

What We Need & What You Get

$25,000 will create opportunities for authors to travel for workshops, panels & readings for their books.


$50,000 will give us the resources to acquire important books from the States and around the world and aid in advertising efforts that are paramount to the life of a book. It will also help us to establish partnerships with organizations doing good work: our goal is to donate portions of proceeds of at least one book a year to a different partner organization.

$75,000 will allow us to hire a part-time publicist who understands our mission and helps us achieve it. We are two people, and we don't have all the resources we need to make sure Penny Candy Books is a true force for change in the world. 

Current & Future Books
Our first three books & their authors & illustrators need your help to find the audiences they deserve:
A Gift from Greensboro is at once an elegy, a celebration of the magic of childhood friendship and adventure, and a meditation on growing up in the wake of the sit-ins that ushered in the Civil Rights Movement. Paired with intricate, brimming-with-life illustrations, this poem recognizes that true friendship knows no boundaries, and this is the true gift from Greensboro. 


The Not In Here Story. In this heartwarming adoption story, the Seeks set out to start a family but soon discover it's not going to be easy. So they embark on a journey that takes them through the desert, mountains, and jungle only to find that they didn’t have to travel so far and so wide to find a child to love after all.  


 

 
Part girl-power, part cautionary tale, The Hunt, by Margaux Othats, is a wordless picture book that chronicles a young girl who builds and rebuilds a rock sculpture as two hunters repeatedly shoot her creation to bits. As the girl perseveres, what she creates becomes a testament to the creative spirit and a condemnation of violence. 
Upcoming Titles
Your contribution will help us usher our new titles into the world. We are working on publishing books from Australia, France, Japan, Palestine, and the US about subjects ranging from understanding death to girl power to human connectedness. We're developing a truly exciting family of authors & illustrators with diverse backgrounds and important stories to tell. 
Our Imprint: Penelope Editions. Books with guts, vision, & humor.

Under our imprint, Penelope Editions, we'll be publishing a coloring book (for kids or adults) called NUVEAU: The Future of Patterns by Tiffany McKnight in December. Every year, we aim to partner with an organization doing good in the world and share profits. This year our organization is called SixTwelve, located in Oklahoma City. Check them out! 

 
Even if you can't contribute, you can help spread the word:

<p>We are a group of local poets committed to promoting and instilling the love of poetry within the general Utah County community. Our objectives are to bring poems to a wider audience, support local poets, and promote poetry in general.</p>
<p>We believe poetry is important. Poetry helps us interpret our world and provides a form of expression unlike any other literary form. Poetry allows us to come closer to people and experiences for which we would otherwise have no access. Events, generations, wars, and entire societies are documented in poetry. People share poems to comfort friends, confess true love, for artistic and emotional release, and as a tool for activism.</p>
<p>Provo Poetry was founded in January 2016 by local poets <a href=""http://trishhopkinson.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Trish Hopkinson</a> and <a href=""http://speakforyourselfopenmic.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Marianne Hales Harding</a>.<br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What will Provo Poetry do?</h3> <p></p>
<p>Provo Poetry will distribute poems written by local poets in creative and interesting ways. Up first—a POEMBALL machine! Put in a quarter, receive a short poem written by a local poet. The first machine already has a home at Enliten Bakery and Café and will be up and running this Spring. Future plans include poems placed on everyday items such as coasters and cup holders, chalk art poetry, and other forms of guerilla poetry. </p>
<p>Provo’s poetry scene is growing and needs additional promotion and encouragement. We will work with Utah arts organizations, local businesses and poets to help get the word out and encourage a strong poetry community in Utah County. All administration time and editorial responsibilities will be donated and managed by local poet volunteers. Funds raised will be used directly for printing costs and other poetry materials.</p>

<p>As parents, we all have experienced the moment when you purchased that <u>one item</u> that your children wanted on Christmas day or their birthday. You walk into the room and your child lights up with excitement. They play with that toy for an hour (maybe two) but then as you start to clean up, you notice that toy laying to the side.<strong> The box that the toy was in has now turned into the ""best toy ever."" </strong></p>
<p>That is where Kardboard Kids came from. Building on the imagination that all kids have and ""smashing"" that with things in our (the parents) past, to create a series of ""how to"" books for the whole family.</p>
<p><strong><i>How to Fly to the Moon in a Cardboard Box</i></strong>, jumps right into the mind of Captain EJ. He is taking a trip to the moon and he has to make sure that he has everything he needs to be successful.    </p>

<p>Emmanuel Threatt and Brian Blackmore came together to create more than a book. They came together to create an experience that kids and adults can enjoy. Brian has a background in illustration, drawing since he was child and honing his skills over the years. Emmanuel has a been <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">creating lyrical content via rap music for more than 20 years.

<p>The purpose of this campaign is to put fuel behind an amazing book. How to Fly to the Moon in a Cardboard Box, is a fun imaginative picture book that pulls on the creativity of children and the nostalgia of the adults.<strong> Reaching the $3,000 campaign goal will allow us at Kardboard Kids to a provide a high-quality, hard-cover, picture book and plush bear that match the high quality content we've created.</strong> Be a part of encouraging imagination in your child the way you experienced it when you were their age. </p>
<p>We believe this book, along with other to come, will be a book that your children (and you) will want to read over and over. From the bright colors and comic book feel, to the hidden ""throwback"" gems scattered throughout this book, we know that you will enjoy reading this. <strong>We cannot express how grateful we are that you would take the time and consider contributing to this campaign. </strong></p>

The box that the toy was in has now turned into the ""best toy ever."" 
That is where Kardboard Kids came from. Building on the imagination that all kids have and ""smashing"" that with things in our (the parents) past, to create a series of ""how to"" books for the whole family.
How to Fly to the Moon in a Cardboard Box, jumps right into the mind of Captain EJ. He is taking a trip to the moon and he has to make sure that he has everything he needs to be successful.    
A Brief Background

Emmanuel Threatt and Brian Blackmore came together to create more than a book. They came together to create an experience that kids and adults can enjoy. Brian has a background in illustration, drawing since he was child and honing his skills over the years. Emmanuel has a been creating lyrical content via rap music for more than 20 years. Both are fathers and both understand the need to engage their children in a deeper and creative way.   
The purpose of this campaign is to put fuel behind an amazing book. How to Fly to the Moon in a Cardboard Box, is a fun imaginative picture book that pulls on the creativity of children and the nostalgia of the adults. Reaching the $3,000 campaign goal will allow us at Kardboard Kids to a provide a high-quality, hard-cover, picture book and plush bear that match the high quality content we've created. Be a part of encouraging imagination in your child the way you experienced it when you were their age. 
We believe this book, along with other to come, will be a book that your children (and you) will want to read over and over. From the bright colors and comic book feel, to the hidden ""throwback"" gems scattered throughout this book, we know that you will enjoy reading this. We cannot express how grateful we are that you would take the time and consider contributing to this campaign.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<ul><li>Kore Press---a Tucson-based nonprofit, feminist publishing house and award-winning innovative literary activist organization dedicated to the creative genius of women and girls for 24 years--is seeking to raise $20K to support programming and the publication of works that fill a gap left by mainstream publishing.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Why Kore? Why people-powered publishing?</strong></p>
<p>To create a people-powered publishing house has clearly become THE most sustainable route for extending the 24 year old feminist platform for women and marginalized voices that is Kore Press. <strong>Our goal is to bring the next season of important projects from the Press to the public as a people-powered enterprise.</strong> A significant portion of our budgets have come from support by the beloved NEA, NEH and associated funding sources. Grants are lovely, soft and volatile resources that have continued to dwindle across recent years, and now, are actively threatened. Our fight to save these important institutions is far from over. Yesterday morning, May 23, President Trump released his proposal for a fiscal year '18 budget (running from October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018), which eliminates both the NEA and the NEH.</p>
<p>In order to launch the Press' Fall season of amazingness (with grants as the icing on the Kore cake, and not the cake itself) we need you on our team like never before! </p>
<p>While the rights of women, immigrants, people of color, queer &amp; trans folks continue to be threatened, the dedicated staff of women at Kore show up to reveal their commitment to impactful, literary justice publishing and programming. We invite you to become a part of the people-powered publishing team for sustaining Kore Press.</p>
<p>Joining our team is a commitment to indie feminist publishing and to an expansive literary landscape. It's a YES to diversity making our communities better, more real, and more rich. It is a YES to trans and queer writers. It's a YES to all women and a YES to minorities. It's a YES to young women's voices, and to visibility no matter what.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what's slated for Fall '17:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1</strong>. The long-awaited, 6-years in the making, one-of-a-kind anthology edited by Dawn Lundy Martin and Erica Hunt for Kore Press, <strong><i>Letters to the Future: Black Women/Radical Writing.</i></strong>  The collection celebrates formal and linguistically innovative late-modern and contemporary work by Black women from the United States, England, Canada, and the Caribbean—work that challenges readers to participate in meaning making.  The writing in the anthology is driven by the writer’s desire to radically present, uncovering what she knows and does not know, as well as critically addressing the future. The book is slated to be launched during a a series of events during the <a href=""https://www.thinkingitspresenceconference.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Thinking Its Presence, Race, Advocacy, Solidarity in the Arts</i></a> conference in Tucson, Oct 19-21.​</p>
<ul><li>​<strong>Why is this important?</strong> The anthology helps re-write the misnomer that innovative writing is white writing and does it with a particular interest in gender. Is it a coincidence that #blacklivesmatter was coined and put into action by black queer women in the same moment that there is a proliferation of black women writing experimental work? Editors Martin and Hunt say, ""We don’t think so. This anthology is part of our means of simply looking at what we are doing together to re-write the future world as unfamiliar. Indeed, it is the familiar, the well-worn racial and racist past that is killing us.”</li></ul>
<p><strong>2</strong>. The posthumous memoir by first generation Catholic Polish Holocaust survivor, Lusia Slomkowska, <strong><i>Christine's Crossing. </i></strong>This trauma memoir is unlike any other and takes its place within a community of testimony, and leaves a historical record. It represents a story of Polish Catholic Holocaust victims and survivors, a story that has not yet been widely told or understood, and will become a part of the archives of written, audio and visual record of the Holocaust, along side the stories of the Jewish genocide. Slomkowska's project is about the personal and historical (trans generational) survival of trauma, breaking silence, and surviving as a witness to the impact of genocide.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Stories can change our world. Kore Press, for the second year, is getting behind the sacred art of story-telling and the empowering practice of truth telling by women by offering an annual Memoir Award, judged by the bad-ass, beautiful writer and heart-wrenching truth sayer, Cheryl Strayed. Strayed says we can learn that “part of being able to bear the things we can’t bear is not about tossing them off, not about making the weight lighter, but simply learning that we have the capacity to carry it.”</p>
<p>This Kore Award is designed not only to launch an emerging woman writer, but demonstrates the Press' commitment to narrative journalism and truth-telling that transcends personal story and resonates with others, as a tool for transforming women's lives.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Kore has completed two successful crowd funding campaigns in the past--one for a single book project, and another for a 10-week, 40-partner, city-wide engagement series called Big Read Tucson, which contemporized Emily Dickinson's life and work. </p>
<p>What is the impact of envelope-pushing, new work . .  . on the culture, the canon, the artists, the readers? We believe the impact of both the first generation Holocaust trauma memoir, <strong>Christine's Crossing, </strong>and the anthology of radical writing by black women artists,  <strong>Letters to the Future,</strong> will be nothing less than groundbreaking.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With a 24-year track record of publishing and programming in a small, non-profit, arts environment, our awareness of the risks and obstacles on the way to achieving our goals are keen! We have been doing amazing, important work for over 2 decades and know how to adjust, retool, and deliver against all odds. There are also a lot of talented folks and entities out there, so it's a richly competitive, exciting playing field for capturing attention and resources. That is a reality. It's June, summer travels, retreats, and unplugging have begun. We will send some snail mail letters, make phone calls, send lots of emails, and do what we do best online as well to capture the hearts and minds of an expanding circle of believers who care!</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
Kore Press---a Tucson-based nonprofit, feminist publishing house and award-winning innovative literary activist organization dedicated to the creative genius of women and girls for 24 years--is seeking to raise $20K to support programming and the publication of works that fill a gap left by mainstream publishing.
Why Kore? Why people-powered publishing?
To create a people-powered publishing house has clearly become THE most sustainable route for extending the 24 year old feminist platform for women and marginalized voices that is Kore Press. Our goal is to bring the next season of important projects from the Press to the public as a people-powered enterprise. A significant portion of our budgets have come from support by the beloved NEA, NEH and associated funding sources. Grants are lovely, soft and volatile resources that have continued to dwindle across recent years, and now, are actively threatened. Our fight to save these important institutions is far from over. Yesterday morning, May 23, President Trump released his proposal for a fiscal year '18 budget (running from October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018), which eliminates both the NEA and the NEH.
In order to launch the Press' Fall season of amazingness (with grants as the icing on the Kore cake, and not the cake itself) we need you on our team like never before! 
While the rights of women, immigrants, people of color, queer & trans folks continue to be threatened, the dedicated staff of women at Kore show up to reveal their commitment to impactful, literary justice publishing and programming. We invite you to become a part of the people-powered publishing team for sustaining Kore Press.
Joining our team is a commitment to indie feminist publishing and to an expansive literary landscape. It's a YES to diversity making our communities better, more real, and more rich. It is a YES to trans and queer writers. It's a YES to all women and a YES to minorities. It's a YES to young women's voices, and to visibility no matter what.
Here's what's slated for Fall '17:
1. The long-awaited, 6-years in the making, one-of-a-kind anthology edited by Dawn Lundy Martin and Erica Hunt for Kore Press, Letters to the Future: Black Women/Radical Writing.  The collection celebrates formal and linguistically innovative late-modern and contemporary work by Black women from the United States, England, Canada, and the Caribbean—work that challenges readers to participate in meaning making.  The writing in the anthology is driven by the writer’s desire to radically present, uncovering what she knows and does not know, as well as critically addressing the future. The book is slated to be launched during a a series of events during the Thinking Its Presence, Race, Advocacy, Solidarity in the Arts conference in Tucson, Oct 19-21.​
​Why is this important? The anthology helps re-write the misnomer that innovative writing is white writing and does it with a particular interest in gender. Is it a coincidence that #blacklivesmatter was coined and put into action by black queer women in the same moment that there is a proliferation of black women writing experimental work? Editors Martin and Hunt say, ""We don’t think so. This anthology is part of our means of simply looking at what we are doing together to re-write the future world as unfamiliar. Indeed, it is the familiar, the well-worn racial and racist past that is killing us.”
2. The posthumous memoir by first generation Catholic Polish Holocaust survivor, Lusia Slomkowska, Christine's Crossing. This trauma memoir is unlike any other and takes its place within a community of testimony, and leaves a historical record. It represents a story of Polish Catholic Holocaust victims and survivors, a story that has not yet been widely told or understood, and will become a part of the archives of written, audio and visual record of the Holocaust, along side the stories of the Jewish genocide. Slomkowska's project is about the personal and historical (trans generational) survival of trauma, breaking silence, and surviving as a witness to the impact of genocide.
and
3. Stories can change our world. Kore Press, for the second year, is getting behind the sacred art of story-telling and the empowering practice of truth telling by women by offering an annual Memoir Award, judged by the bad-ass, beautiful writer and heart-wrenching truth sayer, Cheryl Strayed. Strayed says we can learn that “part of being able to bear the things we can’t bear is not about tossing them off, not about making the weight lighter, but simply learning that we have the capacity to carry it.”
This Kore Award is designed not only to launch an emerging woman writer, but demonstrates the Press' commitment to narrative journalism and truth-telling that transcends personal story and resonates with others, as a tool for transforming women's lives.
 

What We Need & What You Get
People-powered publishing needs to raise $20K to launch in the fall.
Here is what the money is going to:

$1000 design for two books 
$4000 book printing (1000 and 400 copies of each)
$2400 marketing ($400 month x 6 months)
$8000 publishing staff: editorial, publishing ($1333 x 6 months)
$3000 book publicist  ($600/mo x 5 months)
$1600 anthology editorial/artist fees (16 contributors)

 
The perks!
We are excited to share our campaign bling with you: the books! Fun tee shirts, temporary tattoos, chances to win a car, cash or airline tickets! Your name printed in our books, dinner with poets, gift certificates, two nights in a Tucson cottage, special delivery services, pencil drawing portrait session, virtual flourishes of thanks and kisses, and for artists---writing/performance consultancies with super star writers and editors. More creative perks from friends of the Press will be added as the campaign rolls out, too.
What do we do if we don't reach your entire goal, you ask? We'll scale back or do more of the work in-house rather than farming it out!

<h3>Self Publishing Numen Strife! </h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Hello!</strong> My name is M.S. Allan or Monty if you prefer! </p>
<p>I'm here using Indiegogo to realize my desire of Self-publishing my first completed book, </p>
<p>| NUMEN STRIFE |</p>
<p>I've been writing this idea for about 5-6 Years altogether, but have been working on my craft for over half of my life! </p>
<p>I knew that ever since I was about 16 that I wanted to self-publish my first book, and from this point on seek out every which way of publishing and in every piece of media. My goal is small in the grand scope of where I see myself going, but it's an important small step. </p>
<p>You helping me in any way is appreciated and will be noted going down the road, I have ideas (As you'll see in the perks) that include so much of my contributors in my process that the book is just as much meant to become yours as it has been mine. </p>
<p><strong>ELEVATOR PITCH </strong></p>
<p><strong>Numen Strife is a story of sacrifice and hardship. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Powers unknown and creatures unknown that alter the understanding that the human race has always been made to know. </strong></p>
<p><strong>After a mysterious and sudden attack on the Kingdom of Regnus, the Hero Guardians including their leader Diagis, best friend to King Maloin, are wiped out. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Deciding to fall to a dark path in search of finding the next generation of Protectors, King Maloin asks a tournament be held, to pick the best and brightest of his crop to reap and have go under a mortal change. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The story follows the son of Diagis, a young boy turning only fourteen, Vicadum.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>I'm asking for $3,000.00 to fully fund this book release to the extend I need for a further career that begins with this book. </p>
<p>Printing the Book and Shipping (depending on to which country) is equaling more than the $3000 itself, but I'm throwing my own funds in to make sure every copy finds it's way to you. </p>
<p>Making you all apart of this book release has been a HUGE part of why I wanted to use a crowd-sourcing platform for <strong>Numen Strife. </strong></p>
<p>I have so much background info that enriches the read, visuals that help along with viewing the story unfold, secrets and hints to share with those of you who want to see further into the process of the world of Munor/Orbdis (Two different names for the planet the story takes place on. )</p>
<p>All of the perks are designed to give you an insider look, to have you enjoy the book to a further extent if you s please, and to be able to get inside my head on this so we can share a good vision of what more this story can be. </p>
<p><strong>WHY TO DONATE! </strong></p>
<p>The release of the book on this platform means that we all actually get to print and hold the copy, it's a simple and easy goal that I want everyone to be apart of. </p>
<p>When I first held my book, I actually cried. </p>
<p>The Print release means a more lived out desire for me, though I do want to say that outside of the print copies, the book will see it's own release in eBook form on a very popular platform too (hehe), but i wanted to give contributors access to the book and be given all of the other perks I've crafted for them before that. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks! Gah! </p>
<p>I want to do everything in my ability to make sure everyone gets  their copy of the book, the few risks that come with that are <strong>Time - meaning the shipping times could vary depending on who orders what from where! </strong></p>
<p>Another risk I face is <strong>Cost of potential perks - meaning that alongside of just the book being printed and sent out, I have several small things in my perks that include my shipping my own products and pieces of work out to readers.</strong>  </p>
<p>Which I will gladly eat from my own pocket, but the (Hopefully) increasing amounts of followers and backers could see me stressing about how much the cost of sending everything else will be, and again <b>how long it might take to get the smaller items, beside the book.</b></p>

It felt like a call to understand as best I could the soul meaning of the transition that I was approaching. I knew I wanted to live it, to give it the attention one gives to sacred mysteries, to let it be a soul event. I wanted to honor the losses, the continuities, and the transformations. About a year later I set off on a journey around the world that turned out to be  my journey through menopause. Upon my return I realized that somehow things in a deeper place had changed.  I was coming home to Hestia, to a quieter, more centered self. Preparation, Passage, Return--the time-honored phases of a ritual transition. <br/> <br/><br/><strong>PSYCHE’S SISTERS (1988)</strong><br/><br/>Shortly after completing my book on the Greek goddesses I had a series of dreams in which I was challenged to recover a lost sister. These dreams made me aware of how, though I had explored Greek mythology’s illumination of my relation to mother and father, to sons and daughter, husband and lovers, I had completely ignored my relation to sister or brother.

Please include your email address in the correspondence so your donation can be acknowledged.Our target date for publication, with your support, is the summer of 2020. Chris has provided summaries of each book below. JOURNEY THROUGH MENOPAUSE (1987)Shortly before my 50th birthday I dreamt  that I was pregnant, which somehow led me to realize I was on the verge of menopause, preparing to give birth to my menopausal self. It felt like a call to understand as best I could the soul meaning of the transition that I was approaching. I knew I wanted to live it, to give it the attention one gives to sacred mysteries, to let it be a soul event. I wanted to honor the losses, the continuities, and the transformations. About a year later I set off on a journey around the world that turned out to be  my journey through menopause. Upon my return I realized that somehow things in a deeper place had changed.  I was coming home to Hestia, to a quieter, more centered self. Preparation, Passage, Return--the time-honored phases of a ritual transition.  PSYCHE’S SISTERS (1988)Shortly after completing my book on the Greek goddesses I had a series of dreams in which I was challenged to recover a lost sister. These dreams made me aware of how, though I had explored Greek mythology’s illumination of my relation to mother and father, to sons and daughter, husband and lovers, I had completely ignored my relation to sister or brother. This led me to realize how depth psychology, too, in its emphasis on the parent-child, relationship, particularly the mother-child bond, had failed to honor the enormous importance that sibling bonds, literal and imagined, nurturing and disappointing, play in our lives ongoingly. The title is intended to remind us of how in the myth about Cupid and Psyche it is Psyche’s envious sisters who push her toward consciousness.WOMEN’S MYSTERIES (1992)This book was inspired by Esther Harding’s ""Woman’s Mysteries"" published the year I was born and particularly by her powerful evocation of female in-her-self-ness.  I wanted to take this further, to speak of women not woman, to honor more fully the diversity among us. I knew I wanted to begin with female experience, with our bodies and our souls, our dreams and our relationships, and to go on to explore how mysteriously gender enters into the lives of all us, women and men alike.  I sought to imagine a poetics of gender, to explore the ways we humans imagine sexual difference and what longings and fears these images betray, to recognize gender as a created reality, always in the process of being made and remade, to acknowledge that masculine and feminine are fictive terms that hide as well as reveal.GODS IN OUR MIDST (1993)When I published my book on the Greek goddesses, several men asked me, “When will you write about the gods?”  To which I replied, “You’ll have to do that for yourselves.” But after a while I came to realize that we women do need the gods and not only the goddesses.  I found I wanted   to explore how these gods appear to us, how they show up in our lives—not as representing the “masculine,” but as embodying energies and modes of presence at work in the psyches of all of us.

</h3>
<p> For the past 50 years, liberals in America have been following what is considered by many to be the ""Progressive's Bible"", a book titled <i>Rules for Radicals</i> by the late radical socialist Saul Alinsky.  This  book has been used by progressive professors and politicians for decades to the great detriment of American politics, society and spirit. Now, it's our turn - <i>Cues for Conservatives</i> is the how-to handbook and multimedia blueprint for 
proactively defending and promoting conservatism with our changing 
electorate.  By ordering your copy of <i>Cues</i> and supporting our cause, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn how the conservative movement - and the GOP - needs to reshape its message, reboot its image and unite the Republican Party for a 21st century electorate, with a bold new brand and party platform.<br/>
</li>
<li>Get the tools you need to proactively defend and promote conservatism with the ""12 Cues""  - and combat the progressive agenda and Alinsky's 13 ""rules for radicals""</li>
<li>Engage the Millennial Generation - and other demographics who typically support the Democrat party - to explain the <i>Cue's </i>new conservative movement and win their support.</li>
<li>Help us get copies of <i>Cues</i> to every conservative and independent member of Congress - and produce a series of viral web videos - to get our message out and make a difference.</li>

<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>America's political future will very soon lie largely in the 
hands of the Millennial Generation, born between 1981 and 
1999. They are now coming of age and beginning to take over the 
workforce, and soon they'll control American politics, too, leaning 
heavily liberal and Democrat. What will this mean for the 
future of our country? And, how can conservatives respond to this 
alarming trend? <br/></p>
<p>How can we better reach, inspire and engage this younger 
generation to save our country from the failed and destructive liberal 
agenda? The political Left, leaning ever more radically progressive, has
 succeeded in persuading Millennials and other demographics, significantly out-messaging 
conservatives with their mastery of political marketing and domination 
of the media, entertainment and education. If Republicans do not build a
 unified front and develop a clear strategy to win the support of younger 
voters, we will quickly become a permanent minority party.  </p>
<p>I started this project because I, as an experienced marketing
 professional, can no longer stand by as I see radical progressives 
succeed with the younger generation and other groups, while conservatives remain divided and continue with 
the same old and failed methods.  I also believe that the Republican 
party is in need of real change within its ranks, and that the conservative movement 
needs to become more inclusive of Americans of all stripes.  <span>With the growing divisions within the GOP, we need to reshape the party's image and brand to attract a new, younger and evolving audience.<br/></span></p>
<i><em><i>Cues for Conservatives </i></em></i>is a book that I've written -
 and a multimedia movement I've started - that focuses on how the Left has managed 
to win Millennial voters and other key demographics, and how 
conservatives can use some of these same methods, in addition to some 
bold new tactics of our own, to unite our movement and win them back. <br/><div>

<p>Stress, anxiety and trauma touch almost everyone at some point in life. For some it’s a fleeting glimpse. For others it’s being continually managed. There are some for whom, it wrecks their lives.</p>
<p>With your help and support, I’d like us to help more people overcome different types of stress …and then support them to achieve their personal goals!</p>
<p>I’d like us to fund and produce a workbook. A practical self help resource that: </p>
<ul>
<li>Coaches people through a process of <i>identifying opportunities</i> for personal change. </li>

<div>     <h3>     <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The story of Rhoda Derry is one of the tragedies of mental health care in Illinois, and one of the great success stories of the Peoria State Hospital. Rhoda was born in 1834, the beautiful youngest daughter of a farming family. When she was 16, she fell in love with the son of a neighboring farm family. Charles' mother was against the marriage, and threatened to curse Rhoda if she didn't break it off with Charles. Rhoda took her seriously, and it drove her insane.</span>
</h3>
</div>
<div>     I've written extensively about the Peoria State Hospital. My book Fractured Spirits has been well received, and it is my great privilege to share the history of this very haunted asylum with people. Rhoda Derry was one of the patients at the asylum, just one of the many people who was helped by Dr. George Zeller and his staff of compassionate nurses. But she is not a faceless statistic. She lived, and loved. I am grateful to be able to tell her story.</div>
<div>     And I believe her story is vitally important. We are just now getting to the point, in this country, where we can begin to have a conversation about mental illness and the hope for effective treatment. That conversation began over a century ago with Rhoda Derry.</div>
<div>     This book has important things to say about our treatment of the mentally ill. I write about the spirits at the haunted Peoria State Hospital, but I believe this story has the potential to go mainstream. It's not only about ghosts -- it's about a young girl whose life was changed forever by falling in love.</div>
<div>     Your contributions will help me bring this story to the attention of important people in the mental health community. I will use your contributions to print ARCs (advance review copies) of the book, to send to people in the field like Glenn Close, Patrick Kennedy, Kitty Dukakis, John Green, and Carrie Fisher, people who have been touched by mental illness and who have come out stronger for it. I will also send review copies to the mainstream media, to bring their attention to Rhoda's story as well. I intend to get the attention of places like NPR, The Diane Rehm Show, Smithsonian Magazine, and the Wall Street Journal.</div>
<div>     I plan to print review copies through Createspace. I have used this company before; I find that they provide a good product in a timely fashion. Books produced through Createspace look professionally prepared. Your contributions will fund printing of review copies, as well as the postage needed to send those copies to influencers all over the media.</div>
<div>     And in return for your financial support, I have put together lots of great perks, from magnets, to advance copies of the book that you'll receive two months before it hits bookstore shelves, to the opportunity to explore the haunted Pollak Hospital with me as your personal guide. This is my way of saying ""thank you"" for helping me bring Rhoda Derry's story to the world.</div>
<div>     Mental illness touches many people. This was as true in the nineteenth century as it is today. This book will bring history alive. It also has an intensely personal angle to it; in the book, I describe the struggle of someone close to me. Her story and Rhoda's have parallels, although the ending to each story is very different.</div>
<div>     And even if you can't contribute financially, there are other ways you can help. Please feel free to share this campaign. I'm active on Facebook, so that's where we can both share the heck out of this endeavor. Or visit me at <a href=""http://www.sylviashults.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sylviashults.wordpress.com</a>.

Rhoda was born in 1834, the beautiful youngest daughter of a farming family. When she was 16, she fell in love with the son of a neighboring farm family. Charles' mother was against the marriage, and threatened to curse Rhoda if she didn't break it off with Charles. Rhoda took her seriously, and it drove her insane.


     I've written extensively about the Peoria State Hospital. My book Fractured Spirits has been well received, and it is my great privilege to share the history of this very haunted asylum with people. Rhoda Derry was one of the patients at the asylum, just one of the many people who was helped by Dr. George Zeller and his staff of compassionate nurses. But she is not a faceless statistic. She lived, and loved. I am grateful to be able to tell her story.
     And I believe her story is vitally important. We are just now getting to the point, in this country, where we can begin to have a conversation about mental illness and the hope for effective treatment. That conversation began over a century ago with Rhoda Derry.
     This book has important things to say about our treatment of the mentally ill. I write about the spirits at the haunted Peoria State Hospital, but I believe this story has the potential to go mainstream. It's not only about ghosts -- it's about a young girl whose life was changed forever by falling in love.
     Your contributions will help me bring this story to the attention of important people in the mental health community. I will use your contributions to print ARCs (advance review copies) of the book, to send to people in the field like Glenn Close, Patrick Kennedy, Kitty Dukakis, John Green, and Carrie Fisher, people who have been touched by mental illness and who have come out stronger for it. I will also send review copies to the mainstream media, to bring their attention to Rhoda's story as well. I intend to get the attention of places like NPR, The Diane Rehm Show, Smithsonian Magazine, and the Wall Street Journal.
     I plan to print review copies through Createspace. I have used this company before; I find that they provide a good product in a timely fashion. Books produced through Createspace look professionally prepared. Your contributions will fund printing of review copies, as well as the postage needed to send those copies to influencers all over the media.
     And in return for your financial support, I have put together lots of great perks, from magnets, to advance copies of the book that you'll receive two months before it hits bookstore shelves, to the opportunity to explore the haunted Pollak Hospital with me as your personal guide. This is my way of saying ""thank you"" for helping me bring Rhoda Derry's story to the world.
     Mental illness touches many people. This was as true in the nineteenth century as it is today. This book will bring history alive. It also has an intensely personal angle to it; in the book, I describe the struggle of someone close to me. Her story and Rhoda's have parallels, although the ending to each story is very different.
     And even if you can't contribute financially, there are other ways you can help. Please feel free to share this campaign. I'm active on Facebook, so that's where we can both share the heck out of this endeavor. Or visit me at www.sylviashults.wordpress.com. I welcome your feedback, and I look forward to your visit,",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h2><u>Project Goal.</u></h2>
<p>To publish a two-part book series, that will- </p>
<h3><strong>1). <i>Demonstrate the ancient roots of Sūrya Namaskāra &amp; Vinyāsa-Based Postural Yoga</i></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>2). <i>Reveal lost Shakti-based practices critical to Vinyāsa Yoga</i></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>3). <i>Revive many Āsana-based sequences <u>previously unknown</u> to the West</i></strong></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>This  two-volume series will be the <u>first</u> to present the roots and evolution of <i>Yoga Vinyāsa</i>, including<i><i> </i>Surya Namaskara</i> as an ancient practice that spans 1,000+ years of uncharted territory in the history of Yoga.</p>
<p><strong><i>Experience the Flow of Shakti in Your Yoga Practice Like Never Before.</i></strong></p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you'll help me to reveal the ancient heritage and lost practices of  Vinyāsa-based Yoga now engaged by millions worldwide.</p>

<p>I am a Yoga practitioner, Sanskrit Scholar and PhD Candidate with advanced degrees from Harvard and Berkeley in Sanskrit and Religion. I have shared the teachings of Yoga and Tantric Shaivism with thousands of people across the globe.</p>
<p>Through nine years of research into hundreds of unpublished Tantric texts, I have discovered numerous passages which detail the ancient practice of Namaskāra-based postural Yoga, including the development of many Shakti-based Āsana  practices which evolved from it. </p>
<p> In 2014, I began to preview my findings through online courses co-taught with Shiva Rea, including ‘<a href=""http://www.yogaalchemy.com/journeys/collections/history-and-evolution-of-yoga-vinyasa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The History and Evolution of Yoga Vinyāsa</a>’,  ‘<a href=""http://www.yogaalchemy.com/journeys/collections/asana-vinyasa-tantric-origins-of-modern-yoga"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Tantric Origins of Modern Yoga</a>' and most recently, <a href=""http://www.yogaalchemy.com/courses/christopher-tompkins-chandra-namaskar"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">'Chandra Namaskār: The Roots and Evolution.'</a></p>

<p>My book series will be the first to present the roots and evolution of <i>Sūrya Namaskāra</i> and <i>Vinyāsa </i>Yoga as a <i>Shakti</i>-based, <i>mantra</i>-led practice, through passages discovered in 100+ medieval Tantric sources. These sources preceded the patriarchal 'Hatha Yoga' texts known to the West – texts which eliminated the <i>Namaskāra</i> and <i>Āsana</i>-based sequencing original to Tantric Yoga.</p>
<p>By supporting this campaign, you will <u>directly impact</u> the revival of forgotten <i>Vinyāsa</i> Yoga practices which comprised an empowering ritual of embodied movement meditation that honors the Divine Feminine, as originally conceived in the Tantras.</p>
<p><strong><i>“The Namaskāra practice is a continually moving flow which immerses the practitioner in a pervading flood of divine contentment.

<h2>What to Expect in these Books.</h2>
<h3><strong>A. <i>Sūrya Namaskāra</i> demonstrated as an Ancient Yoga Practice.</strong></h3>
<p>My first book will prove that <i>Sūrya Namaskāra</i> was always considered a core practice of the Tantric Yoga tradition. Drawing from numerous, overlooked Tantric sources, I will show the place and role of Vinyāsa-based Yoga as one of the preliminary ‘rites’ of daily Tantric Yoga practice. </p>
<h3><strong>B. A Detailed Study of Three Daily Namaskāra Yoga Practices </strong></h3>
<p>My books will reveal Namaskāra-based Vinyāsa Yoga as it was <u>originally</u>  performed - as a practice imbued with the Divine Feminine, expressed in sonic form as the Shakti ('Power') of  <u>Mantras</u>, which led  each sequence - </p>
<p>I'll show that these 3 practices were universally prescribed from about 1000 AD forward, and were prescribed in sources representing at least 6 Tantric lineages:</p>
<p><strong>#1. 'Classic' Sūrya Namaskāra ~</strong> performed at the Dawn Juncture (<i>Sandhyā</i>)~ Sequence of 12 poses led by the transformative power of Shakti, in the form of the seed mantras HRAM, HRIM, HRUM, HRAIM, HRAUM, and HRAH.</p>
<p><strong>#2<i>. Namaskāra as the </i>'Fierce Practice' ~</strong> Noon Juncture (<i>Sandhyā</i>)~ 16 Poses following the Syllables of a Vedic or Tantric Verse, sounds which represented the embodied (sonic) flow of the Divine Feminine which empowered and transformed one's physical and subtle bodies through engaged movement.</p>
<p><strong>#3. <i> </i>Chandra Namaskāra (Lunar Prostration Sequence)  ~</strong> Dusk Juncture (<i>Sandhyā</i>) ~ 7 to 64 possible postures ~ this sequence would inspire countless Āsana-based sub-routines of Vinyāsa Yoga, which have come down to us today; several of these will be featured in Part II of this book series</p>
<p><u>My books will also reveal</u><b> - </b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong> Pranayama</strong> (breath extension) techniques since lost to us, as originally  choreographed with  <i>Namaskāra-based </i>postural sequencing</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Chakra Vinyāsa</i> - </strong>How the shapes of the Chakras became Embodied Postures in the original sequence of<i>Chandra Namaskāra</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong><i>The Role of Mudrā Vinyāsa</i> as <u><i>Dance</i></u></strong>  in Namaskāra Practice and how  improvisational <i>(sahaja)</i> movement  originally defined Vinyāsa Based Yoga </li>

<h3><strong>C. <i>Niyamāsana</i> - Tantric Renovation of the '8 Limbs' of the <i>Yogasūtra</i> as Embodied Practice.</strong></h3>
<p>My books will teach the extraordinary place and relevance of the Yogasūtra to Āsana Based Vinyāsa Yoga, and will  thus finally explain why Krishnamacharya and his students, such as Pattabhis Jois (Ashtanga Yoga) held such reverence for the '8 Limbs' of Patañjali's practice - </p>
<p><i> For the first time*,<strong>  </strong></i>I will show that how the Vishnu-based Tantras incorporated Patanjali’s 8 Limbs (<i>Ashtanga</i>) into a fully <i>embodied</i> <i>practice</i> which embraced dynamic movement as a central part of daily sādhana, called Haṭha Yoga. </p>
<p><strong><i>“…Āsana is understood to be an obligatory observance (niyamāsana) in the (Tantric) teaching. In this case (vs. the Yogasūtra), the purpose of Āsana is to reverse the negative effect of bodily weakness through exertion applied to one’s own [body].”  </i>-<i>Tattvavaiśāradi</i> of Vacaspati, late 10th century </strong></p>

<h3><strong>D. <i>The Rise of</i> <i>Āsana Vinyāsa</i>: Source Texts of T. Krishnamacharya’s Mysore Yoga Revival. </strong></h3>
<p>Volume II  will trace the 1000-year evolution of Āsana-based <i>Vinyasa </i>Yoga from its Sūrya Namaskāra roots, revealing the premodern sources for more than 65% of the Āsana practices revived by Krishnamacharya and the Mysore school.This will include more than 200 Āsanas, most of which are known and practiced today, in the original sequences in which they appeared and were taught in Krishnamacharya's sources (listed in the preface to his 1934 book, the <i>Yoga Makaranda</i>).</p>
<h3><strong>D. Comprehensive Index of All Sūrya Namaskāra Passages to be included in these Books.</strong></h3>
<p> Volume I will include a comprehensive index of over <u>six dozen previously unpublished</u> <i>Sūrya Namaskāra</i> passages, spanning 1000 years of the Yoga tradition, in order to encourage future scholarship on the ancient Tantric heritage of modern <i>Vinyāsa</i>-based yoga.

</div></div>","Project Goal.
To publish a two-part book series, that will- 
1). Demonstrate the ancient roots of Sūrya Namaskāra & Vinyāsa-Based Postural Yoga
2). Reveal lost Shakti-based practices critical to Vinyāsa Yoga
3). Revive many Āsana-based sequences previously unknown to the West
 
This  two-volume series will be the first to present the roots and evolution of Yoga Vinyāsa, including Surya Namaskara as an ancient practice that spans 1,000+ years of uncharted territory in the history of Yoga.
Experience the Flow of Shakti in Your Yoga Practice Like Never Before.
By contributing to this campaign, you'll help me to reveal the ancient heritage and lost practices of  Vinyāsa-based Yoga now engaged by millions worldwide.
 
My Background.

I am a Yoga practitioner, Sanskrit Scholar and PhD Candidate with advanced degrees from Harvard and Berkeley in Sanskrit and Religion. I have shared the teachings of Yoga and Tantric Shaivism with thousands of people across the globe.
Through nine years of research into hundreds of unpublished Tantric texts, I have discovered numerous passages which detail the ancient practice of Namaskāra-based postural Yoga, including the development of many Shakti-based Āsana  practices which evolved from it. 
 In 2014, I began to preview my findings through online courses co-taught with Shiva Rea, including ‘The History and Evolution of Yoga Vinyāsa’,  ‘The Tantric Origins of Modern Yoga' and most recently, 'Chandra Namaskār: The Roots and Evolution.'

 
Be a Part of the Shakti Revival. 
Experience the Liberating Power of the Divine Feminine in Yoga Practice.

My book series will be the first to present the roots and evolution of Sūrya Namaskāra and Vinyāsa Yoga as a Shakti-based, mantra-led practice, through passages discovered in 100+ medieval Tantric sources. These sources preceded the patriarchal 'Hatha Yoga' texts known to the West – texts which eliminated the Namaskāra and Āsana-based sequencing original to Tantric Yoga.
By supporting this campaign, you will directly impact the revival of forgotten Vinyāsa Yoga practices which comprised an empowering ritual of embodied movement meditation that honors the Divine Feminine, as originally conceived in the Tantras.
“The Namaskāra practice is a continually moving flow which immerses the practitioner in a pervading flood of divine contentment. It is best performed after reciting of 108 Self-Empowering Names of the Goddess. The Namaskara practice manifests within Oneself the Love which sustains all Life.""  - Pūrṇānanda, from his Tattva Cintāmaṇi​ (16th century)
These books will furthermore  reveal the fundamental role of improvisational *dance* within the Sequencing of Surya Namaskāra, as taught in the Tantras -  
“O Goddess, through this flowing Namaskāra practice, one experiences a Dance. Performed regularly, the highest Beloved will manifest....through which She who Personifies the Force (Shakti) of liberation rises forth. She is one’s very own, intimate power, arising from within one’s Self.  Now hear about the method of our practice....” - Sarvollāsa Tantra (ca. 1400 A.D.)
An overview of Tantric texts to be featured in my books, all of which containing previously un-documented passages of this Shakti-based Vinyāsa Yoga practice, may be found in my 'Namaskāra Timeline' video (below), which begins to fill in the awkward, thousand year gap that appears in most historical timelines of the Yoga tradition -

What to Expect in these Books.
A. Sūrya Namaskāra demonstrated as an Ancient Yoga Practice.
My first book will prove that Sūrya Namaskāra was always considered a core practice of the Tantric Yoga tradition. Drawing from numerous, overlooked Tantric sources, I will show the place and role of Vinyāsa-based Yoga as one of the preliminary ‘rites’ of daily Tantric Yoga practice. 
B. A Detailed Study of Three Daily Namaskāra Yoga Practices 
My books will reveal Namaskāra-based Vinyāsa Yoga as it was originally  performed - as a practice imbued with the Divine Feminine, expressed in sonic form as the Shakti ('Power') of  Mantras, which led  each sequence - 
I'll show that these 3 practices were universally prescribed from about 1000 AD forward, and were prescribed in sources representing at least 6 Tantric lineages:
#1. 'Classic' Sūrya Namaskāra ~ performed at the Dawn Juncture (Sandhyā)~ Sequence of 12 poses led by the transformative power of Shakti, in the form of the seed mantras HRAM, HRIM, HRUM, HRAIM, HRAUM, and HRAH.
#2. Namaskāra as the 'Fierce Practice' ~ Noon Juncture (Sandhyā)~ 16 Poses following the Syllables of a Vedic or Tantric Verse, sounds which represented the embodied (sonic) flow of the Divine Feminine which empowered and transformed one's physical and subtle bodies through engaged movement.
#3.  Chandra Namaskāra (Lunar Prostration Sequence)  ~ Dusk Juncture (Sandhyā) ~ 7 to 64 possible postures ~ this sequence would inspire countless Āsana-based sub-routines of Vinyāsa Yoga, which have come down to us today; several of these will be featured in Part II of this book series
My books will also reveal -

C. Niyamāsana - Tantric Renovation of the '8 Limbs' of the Yogasūtra as Embodied Practice.
My books will teach the extraordinary place and relevance of the Yogasūtra to Āsana Based Vinyāsa Yoga, and will  thus finally explain why Krishnamacharya and his students, such as Pattabhis Jois (Ashtanga Yoga) held such reverence for the '8 Limbs' of Patañjali's practice - 
 For the first time*,  I will show that how the Vishnu-based Tantras incorporated Patanjali’s 8 Limbs (Ashtanga) into a fully embodied practice which embraced dynamic movement as a central part of daily sādhana, called Haṭha Yoga. 
“…Āsana is understood to be an obligatory observance (niyamāsana) in the (Tantric) teaching. In this case (vs. the Yogasūtra), the purpose of Āsana is to reverse the negative effect of bodily weakness through exertion applied to one’s own [body].”  -Tattvavaiśāradi of Vacaspati, late 10th century

D. The Rise of Āsana Vinyāsa: Source Texts of T. Krishnamacharya’s Mysore Yoga Revival. 
Volume II  will trace the 1000-year evolution of Āsana-based Vinyasa Yoga from its Sūrya Namaskāra roots, revealing the premodern sources for more than 65% of the Āsana practices revived by Krishnamacharya and the Mysore school.This will include more than 200 Āsanas, most of which are known and practiced today, in the original sequences in which they appeared and were taught in Krishnamacharya's sources (listed in the preface to his 1934 book, the Yoga Makaranda).

Besides interviewing writers, I bring in other writers for roundtable discussions related to literature, as well as respond to listener mail with David James Poissant and review books about the craft of writing with Vanessa Blakeslee.</p>
<p>The experience of putting on and releasing this show has been an extraordinary pleasure for me, but I do need some help making the show sustainable in the future. There are regular expenses of producing the show, travel expenses, and upgrades that would really help The Drunken Odyssey be able to keep releasing great content. I am asking m y listeners, new and old, to donate to the show towards these goals.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>This year, I’m trying to raise $1,500. Any progress toward this ultimate goal will help us to achieve a number of incremental goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative costs: hosting on Wordpress and file hosting on Libsyn.</li>
<li>Equipment upgrades: TDO really needs more microphones, digital recorders, and a good camera to build up our youtube content.</li>
<li>Travel: Miami Book Fair International is a significant cost, despite how frugal your podcast host tends to be. The AWP Conference in Tampa will also incur costs to the show.</li>
<li>Any cash left over will be saved towards future administrative costs. </li>
</ul>
<p>The perks are fab! </p>
<p>If I reach my goal of $1,500, I'll record a bonus episode for donors.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The Drunken Odyssey offers a great value to the literary community. Its interviews are remarkable. The breadth of its scope is impressive; where else can you listen to novelists, short story writers, poets, journalists, screenwriters, scholars, and artists discuss their process and life’s work? Plus, it’s like an uncensored NPR, so the host and guests can curse when necessary, or admit when the world happens to be fucking far from a civilized place. We also do public readings, and produce the Litlando Conference each year.</p>
<p>I have managed to keep up the high quality of the show with a very limited budget, but will need a little help to sustain and improve upon the quality of the work I have been doing.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The main risk of my podcast, as I see it, is stagnation. I don’t want the show to seem like an exercise asking the same questions and fielding a predictable range of answers. I happen to be fiercely curious, hence my unwillingness to limit the show to a genre. I have genuinely enjoyed every interview, whether the writer is experiencing her first book publication, or the author was an inaugural poet, like Richard Blanco. But I do want to keep exploring with this show, and to keep expanding the media it produces. Later this fall, TDO should be releasing its first web series.</p>
<p>The challenge is expanding without losing the high quality you’ve come to expect on the show. Generally speaking, TDO sounds great. The interviews sound sharp, and are memorable. If the economics of running the show were taken care of for the next year, which $1,500 would take care of, then I should be able to focus on these new adventures.</p>

<p>We are Jay Tinsiano and Jay Newton.</p>
<p>Jay Tinsiano has been writing and publishing the Frank Bowen conspiracy fiction series since 2012. Jay Newton joined forces in 2013 to help expand the Bowen fictional world and plan the Dark Paradigm series.</p>
<p>The Dark Paradigm series outlines the epic struggle between the occult driven cabal that control the global power elite and a determined activist organisation called Liberatus.</p>
<p>An initial four books will set the scene as the cabal attempt to implement their Four Horse operations in a bid to bring about an apocalyptic D-day through the eyes of the main protagonists; all bearing their own demons and internal battles.</p>
<p>This campaign is all about raising the funds to launch this series. We sincerely believe Dark Paradigm will become a major success. In order to give the books the highest quality service for editing, cover jacket designs and the imprint launch we have decided to create a valuable funding proposition exclusively on IndieGoGo.</p>
<p>We've calculated an average cost of 2k per book in the series, hence the 8k total.</p>
<p>We have some exciting perks including the Frank Bowen library of existing books, signed paperbacks, an advance on the Dark Paradigm and Dark Ops series with opportunities to get your name inside the books.</p>
<p>We are also offering to critique your own stories and even ghost write you an exclusive story that you can name and publish as your own</p>
<p>If we fail to raise the required amounts we will put any funds towards the production of the first books such as editing and cover design.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us launch not just a series but a book imprint that we hope will become a hub for fans of thrillers, post-apocalyptic and sci-fi books.</p>
<p>When it comes to risks for completion of this projects, there are very few. We have a track record of finishing and publishing books. In fact the only way this series won’t be completed is if we are targeted in a stealth covert operation by global intelligence agencies.</p>

Depardieu has performed in nearly 200 films since 1967 and needs little to no introduction. He has worked with many of the world’s most acclaimed directors, including Jean-Luc Godard, Bernardo Bertolucci, Marguerite Duras, Bertrand Blier, Alain Resnais, Marco Ferreri, Peter Handke, Francois Truffaut, Andrez Wajda &amp; others. He is the recipient of the César Award for Best Actor (1981; 1991), the Venice Film Festival Award for Best Actor (1985), the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor (1990), a Stanislavsky Award (2006) from the Moscow Film Festival for outstanding achievement in the career of acting, etc. Depardieu is also a Chevalier of the Ordre national du Mérite and a Chevalier of the Légion d’honneur.</p><p>In addition to being an actor and entrepreneur, Depardieu is the author of numerous books, including <i>Lettres volées</i> (1988), <i>Vivant!</i> (2004), <i>Ma cuisine</i> (2005), <i>Ça s’est fait comme ça</i> (2014), and <i>Innocent</i> (2015). In his latest book, Depardieu presents fervent reflections on friendship, cinema, religion, politics and more, espousing a notion of innocence that calls us to move beyond dogma and ideology &amp; to engage with others with respect, receptivity, and mindfulness.

Our art journal, Hyperion: On the Future of Aesthetics, has an annual readership of over 125,000 people stretching from the Americas to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia.CMP is seeking support to pay for the translation rights to world-renowned film actor Gerard Depardieu’s critically acclaimed book Innocent. Depardieu has performed in nearly 200 films since 1967 and needs little to no introduction. He has worked with many of the world’s most acclaimed directors, including Jean-Luc Godard, Bernardo Bertolucci, Marguerite Duras, Bertrand Blier, Alain Resnais, Marco Ferreri, Peter Handke, Francois Truffaut, Andrez Wajda & others. He is the recipient of the César Award for Best Actor (1981; 1991), the Venice Film Festival Award for Best Actor (1985), the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor (1990), a Stanislavsky Award (2006) from the Moscow Film Festival for outstanding achievement in the career of acting, etc. Depardieu is also a Chevalier of the Ordre national du Mérite and a Chevalier of the Légion d’honneur.In addition to being an actor and entrepreneur, Depardieu is the author of numerous books, including Lettres volées (1988), Vivant! (2004), Ma cuisine (2005), Ça s’est fait comme ça (2014), and Innocent (2015). In his latest book, Depardieu presents fervent reflections on friendship, cinema, religion, politics and more, espousing a notion of innocence that calls us to move beyond dogma and ideology & to engage with others with respect, receptivity, and mindfulness. We believe it a necessary if not vital book for our combative and divisive times.To lend support to this project is not to stand in absolute agreement with the writer but to engage in a dialogue, to obtain clarity about Depardieu, to gain an intimate and direct view of what he believes, and the conflicts that are polarizing our world.By contributing to this campaign, you will help CMP publish a total of 10,000 copies of Innocent, the largest print run of a book since our inception, which will be a great achievement in and of itself.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Peace be upon you. My name is Luqman (Luis Jijon). I am known as Ustadh Luqman Al-Andalusi. <br/>Over the past few years I have published three books now. <br/>1) The Virtues of Ali ibn Abi Talib, 2) The Life and Marriage of Fatimah Al-Zahrah, 3) The 100 Jewels of Hadith - 100 Hadith to Memorize. </p>
<p>I am trying to get more funding to release many others books I have in the works and translations. All the books will be translated into Spanish as well. In Sha' Allah.   </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Every contributor will have access to my lectures, lessons, books, etc for free.<br/>The 7,000 is being used to pay the people involved in the making of the book, as well as the printing out of books in general. </li>
<li>I have gone overseas to learn and teach. I can speak Arabic, English and Spanish. Alhamdulillah. This is my life, I take the research of the Prophet's family, peace be upon them all, very serious.

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><br/>The teachings of the Ahlul Bayt, are most valuable to society. For example, Imam Husayn is known as the world's greatest revolutionary, Imam Hasan is known for his charity and his teachings of spirituality. Imam Jafar Al-Sadiq for example, was one of the teachers of many of the great Sunni Imams we all follow to this day. <br/><br/>One should be able to tell I am very serious, as I spend all of my free times within study, research and the like.

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><br/>The challenges I always have are monetary. Alhamdulillah, I feel good from a spiritual point of view, yet I cannot deny the fact that these funds are needed and that I may get stressed or depressed if I cannot continue this work. May Allah forbid that. Ya Rabb! <br/> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><br/>No worries, if one cannot contribute financially. In Islam we believe that our supplications to Allah are the real wealth.

På dagen sover de, men på nätterna kommer de fram för att busa och gosa. En natt när de vaknar upptäcker de en söt liten dammråtta som springer runt och leker i rummet. Dammråttan Tusse är mycket nyfiken av sig, men inte så försiktig. Bus och Gos måste se till att hen inte väcker det lilla barnet som ligger och sover.</i></p><p><i>Det är en bok om vänskap och nyfikenhet, som tar med barnet på ett alldeles speciellt äventyr där endast fantasin sätter gränser för vad som kan hända i ett helt vanligt barnrum…</i></p><p>Boken riktar sig till de yngsta läsarna från 0-6 år. Den är lätt för de minsta att ta till sig tack vare det enkla språket och de färgglada bilderna, och bjuder in de lite större till interaktion. Tusse på äventyr blir den första boken i en serie om Bus, Gos och Tusse. Hoppas era barn vill följa med på fler äventyr framöver!</p><p> </p><h3>Om Tusen förlag</h3><p><strong>Tänk om det vore möjligt att skapa en positiv förändring i världen, kanske inte idag eller ens imorgon, men längre fram, när våra barn och barnbarn har vuxit upp och tagit över våra roller och världen. Hur vill vi att det ska se ut då? Och vad kan vi göra nu för att påverka det då?</strong></p><p><strong>Detta är frågor och funderingar som har format det som nu har blivit Tusen förlag. Ett förlag med ambitionen att sträva efter jämställdhet och likabehandling, gemenskap och inkludering, mångfald och normbrytande. Vi tror på att barnen är vår framtid, och det bästa sättet att skapa långsiktig förändring är genom att skapa för dem. På Tusen förlag strävar vi efter att skapa kunskap och underhållning för barn, för att de i framtiden ska kunna ha mer än en, två eller till och med tusen möjligheter!</strong></p><p> </p><h3>Bokens bakgrund</h3><p>Nu står vi inför utgivningen av vår första barnbok, <i>Bus och Gos - Tusse på äventyr</i>, en bok som jag skrev och illustrerade för nästan 10 år sedan när jag gick på gymnasiet. Redan då brann jag för genus och jämställdhetsfrågor och drömde om den dagen då jag själv skulle kunna bidra till en förändring för mitt och alla andra barn. </p><p>Det var under de år som hen-debatten hade börjat få liv och alla hade en åsikt, men jag upptäckte snabbt att många inte riktigt förstod nyttan eller poängen med att använda ett tredje pronomen. Det är lätt att motsätta sig något som man inte förstår, och ordet var ännu inte så utbrett så det var inte helt lätt att visa exempel där ordet kunde vara till nytta. Ytterligare ett problem var att många som förstod nyttan och ville använda ordet kände att det var svårt att vänja sig vid det. </p><p>Då fick jag idén att skriva en barnbok som enbart använder pronomen hen. På så vis kunde barn lära sig ordet från början, samtidigt som vuxna fick en möjlighet att vänja sig vid att säga det i ett avslappnat och kravlöst sammanhang. I den här boken blir det tydligt att ordet öppnar upp för fler möjligheter och att kön inte har så stor betydelse för någons handlingar eller beteende som man tidigare har trott. </p><h3> </h3><h3>Om författaren</h3><p><i>Bus och Gos - Tusse på äventyr</i> är skriven och illustrerad av mig själv, Tiara Norlin. Det är även jag som har grundat Tusen Förlag, och det är främst tack vare denna bok. Jag visste från början att jag ville ge ut boken och var beredd på att det skulle vara svårt att få ut den på ett etablerat förlag, så jag beslutade mig tidigt för att egenutgivning skulle passa mig. Ju mer jag lärde mig om litteraturbranschen och utgivningsprocessen kände jag att jag skulle kunna göra så mycket mer än att bara ge ut en egen bok. Så började idén om ett helt nytt bokförlag för barnböcker som erbjuder mångfald och igenkänning för fler barn. <i>Bus och Gos - Tusse på äventyr</i> kommer alltså vara startskottet för Tusen Förlag, och boken kommer att efterföljas av verk från flera författare och illustratörer utöver mig själv. </p><p>Jag har alltid varit intresserad av bild, animation och storytelling. Innan jag bestämde mig för att rikta in mig på litteratur studerade jag animation och digital bildproduktion på både gymnasie- och högskolenivå.

På dagen sover de, men på nätterna kommer de fram för att busa och gosa. En natt när de vaknar upptäcker de en söt liten dammråtta som springer runt och leker i rummet. Dammråttan Tusse är mycket nyfiken av sig, men inte så försiktig. Bus och Gos måste se till att hen inte väcker det lilla barnet som ligger och sover.Det är en bok om vänskap och nyfikenhet, som tar med barnet på ett alldeles speciellt äventyr där endast fantasin sätter gränser för vad som kan hända i ett helt vanligt barnrum…Boken riktar sig till de yngsta läsarna från 0-6 år. Den är lätt för de minsta att ta till sig tack vare det enkla språket och de färgglada bilderna, och bjuder in de lite större till interaktion. Tusse på äventyr blir den första boken i en serie om Bus, Gos och Tusse. Hoppas era barn vill följa med på fler äventyr framöver! Om Tusen förlagTänk om det vore möjligt att skapa en positiv förändring i världen, kanske inte idag eller ens imorgon, men längre fram, när våra barn och barnbarn har vuxit upp och tagit över våra roller och världen. Hur vill vi att det ska se ut då? Och vad kan vi göra nu för att påverka det då?Detta är frågor och funderingar som har format det som nu har blivit Tusen förlag. Ett förlag med ambitionen att sträva efter jämställdhet och likabehandling, gemenskap och inkludering, mångfald och normbrytande. Vi tror på att barnen är vår framtid, och det bästa sättet att skapa långsiktig förändring är genom att skapa för dem. På Tusen förlag strävar vi efter att skapa kunskap och underhållning för barn, för att de i framtiden ska kunna ha mer än en, två eller till och med tusen möjligheter! Bokens bakgrundNu står vi inför utgivningen av vår första barnbok, Bus och Gos - Tusse på äventyr, en bok som jag skrev och illustrerade för nästan 10 år sedan när jag gick på gymnasiet. Redan då brann jag för genus och jämställdhetsfrågor och drömde om den dagen då jag själv skulle kunna bidra till en förändring för mitt och alla andra barn. Det var under de år som hen-debatten hade börjat få liv och alla hade en åsikt, men jag upptäckte snabbt att många inte riktigt förstod nyttan eller poängen med att använda ett tredje pronomen. Det är lätt att motsätta sig något som man inte förstår, och ordet var ännu inte så utbrett så det var inte helt lätt att visa exempel där ordet kunde vara till nytta. Ytterligare ett problem var att många som förstod nyttan och ville använda ordet kände att det var svårt att vänja sig vid det. Då fick jag idén att skriva en barnbok som enbart använder pronomen hen. På så vis kunde barn lära sig ordet från början, samtidigt som vuxna fick en möjlighet att vänja sig vid att säga det i ett avslappnat och kravlöst sammanhang. I den här boken blir det tydligt att ordet öppnar upp för fler möjligheter och att kön inte har så stor betydelse för någons handlingar eller beteende som man tidigare har trott.  Om författarenBus och Gos - Tusse på äventyr är skriven och illustrerad av mig själv, Tiara Norlin.

To tailor this book towards a variety of audiences with various interests in the domain of leadership, Modest Leader is written in the following 4 parts:</p><p><strong>Part 1 </strong>Renovation of Society’s Expectations. Fasten your seats belts as this section contains the introduction + introductory chapters that acquaints the reader with the world of leadership, what it has been, what people may see it as and the new approach towards leadership.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> Augment the Content. This is the golden section of this guide, where you, reader will get the ability to dive into the key components of being not just a leader but an effective everyday leader. Furthermore you will gain profound, research based insight from decades of credible resources such as the Harvard Business Review where you will begin to understand how these tactics have been successful. From the CEO of PepsiCo to acclaimed medical professionals you will see how these invaluable skills can facilitate in improving the value of your life.<br/><br/><strong>Part  3 </strong>Here is the Destination Application where you reader will now not only have been exposed to the tactics and ways of some of the world’s best leaders, but now you finally use their keys to unlock the doors that await your future.

<h3>About this Project</h3>
<p>Environmental racism is indicative to the fact that racism can affect an individual’s environment for the intended purpose of allowing the access to clean water and basic human rights being limited in certain areas that are largely populated by minority groups for profit.</p>
<p>So, how do we overcome this level of racial inequality? And why don’t many of us know we are subjected to it?</p>
<p>Hello, I am Nadia Fischer, Social Justice Activist and Publicist.</p>
<p>In my new book, <i><strong>My Water Has Never Been Clean</strong></i>,  will attempt to take you on a journey of self-disclosure and allow you intimate access to a little girl's personal experiences, when basic water rights and justice collide. This little girl will reveal the pains of her past, define the nature of the present and her obsession for a better future for humanity.</p>
<p>I am asking for your support to bring this book to completion, launch and print so that it may be published in January 2021.</p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p><strong><i>My Water Has Never Been Clean</i></strong> is incredibly close to completion and launch, and I need my community's help to make it all the way! All proceeds from this campaign will go towards the finishing costs of bringing this book to market, including editing, copy-editing, formatting, printing and shipping. $850.00 will support me in publishing both digital and paperback forms.</p>
<p>I believe that to publish does NOT mean to diminish the quality or reach of this work! Therefore, I have not skimped on any finishing step, design or detail. I am committed to doing it the right way and all the way. </p>
<h3>Why This Book is Needed in the World</h3>
<p>As a little girl, I knew there was something wrong with the water and how the cultural shift was having a negative impact on my community. I looked everywhere outside myself for the answers and to fix the issues. Discouragingly enough, I didn’t find them.</p>
<p>Then one day, all of that changed… I began an inward journey to discover my true voice; which is activism.</p>
<p>My heart breaks every day witnessing so many people who look me that struggle with trying to be equal and not be judged by the color of their skin.</p>
<p>I am a sensitive and soulful African American woman, I too walked through the world carrying these realities and how the world views my culture. This is a heavy burden that no one should have to bare. </p>
<p>The reality is that people of color have been carrying these burdens for many generations, and thus, the wounds begin early in childhood and run very deep. Just as it did for me.</p>
<p>It wasn’t always easy. Confronting all the racially closed doors and constantly telling myself that I am equal significantly challenged me to my core.</p>
<p>But it was also so worth it! Because with each wounding burden, I learned to heal and release. I discovered a new truth about who I really am as a woman of color. With each new truth, I took another step towards living the life that would bring me real happiness and fulfillment and that is fighting for the unjust.</p>
<p>I invite you to come on a journey of self-discovery and revelation. Of deep, soul healing that will crack you wide open. In <i><strong>My Water Has Never Been Clean</strong></i>, I share it all, from my struggles and heartache, to my greatest breakthrough moments.</p>
<p>And as you follow along, you will discover the truths behind your own wounding beliefs. About how uniquely worthy, powerful and human you are.</p>
<p>This is the book that I, once upon a time, so desperately needed. It could have saved me from years of heartache and struggle of the harsh realities of racism. It is the book that I know will change minds, heal hearts and transform the lives of so many.</p>
<h3>About Nadia Fischer, The Author</h3>
<p>At the impressionable age of eight years old, Nadia witnessed firsthand the physical and mental health consequences of what incarceration does to families and communities when her eldest brother received ten to twenty years as a first time, non-violent offender. Over the next ten years as Nadia visited her brother in prison she vowed to always be his advocate and to stand up against unfairness and injustice.<br/> <br/>In 2014, Nadia established “Incarceration Relief Resource Center,” a non-profit organization dedicated to faith and community-based interventions for offender re-entry. IRRC is a nationwide social justice advocacy organization with the mission to reduce incarceration and improve outcomes for system-involved offenders. IRRC assists offenders to successfully re-enter their communities by helping to provide housing, employment, education, access to effective mental health, chemical dependency, primary care treatment services, government assistance programs, and spiritual connectedness. To date, Nadia has been the conduit for the release of 102 returning citizens, with 0% recidivism.<br/> <br/>A native of Flint, Michigan, Nadia has a special interest in clean water and agriculture. She is a strong advocate for improved food and water products in the prison system. Through her work and research, she believes there is a direct link between the substandard food and water that is served and the resulting behaviors of prisoners. Nadia has been commended for her work by such notables as Attorney Mark Osler, author of Jesus on Death Row and Bryan Stevenson, founder and Executive Director of the Equal Justice Initiative who dubbed her a “freedom fighter.”<br/> <br/>As the Chair of the Cincinnati NAACP Prison Branch Committee and the Community Lead for MOBB United, Nadia is charged with extending community and educational resources to returning citizens as well as emotional encouragement to support hurting, brokenhearted moms of incarcerated sons. The emotional aftermath of incarceration is often overlooked by the judicial system and the public when families lose their loved ones to the system. Nadia’s goal is to raise global awareness of the silent cries and deep emotional trauma experienced by the population that she serves. Nadia is passionately dedicated to the work she sees as her calling. She is sustained by her faith in God and inspired by these words of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.""...injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere....caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.

<h3>About This Campaign</h3>
<p>I am a former software developer turned entrepreneur. In 1996 I bootstrapped my own software development business out of a spare bedroom and grew it into a multi-million-dollar company. I learned  the hard way, by making many mistakes, how to transition from being a successful developer to a successful businessman.</p>
<p>After 20+ years as the CEO of the business, I sold my stake in the company to my younger business partner who will take it on to the next stage of its life. It was time for me to channel my energy into other projects that I'd always wanted to do. </p>
<p>During my time as CEO of the business I built up a huge well of knowledge and experience about how to grow and operate a profitable software development business. I knew this knowledge would be very valuable to other developers thinking of starting their own business and I wanted to try and capture it in a book. But I struggled to find the time to do this while I was working.</p>
<p>My exit from the business got me thinking about writing the book. Then Covid-19 came along. It proved to be a great time for me to start the process of capturing my experience in book form. In the region where I live we were put under tight lockdown restrictions for a number of months so I was housebound for much of the time. I used the writing process as a way to keep myself busy during that time. As I got into the writing process I found that it flowed very easily and I really enjoyed it. Over a period of about 6 months and hundreds of hours of writing I managed to get the main manuscript completed.</p>
<p>Since then I've been learning all about book publishing. And what a very confusing world that is. I never really encountered writer's block. I found that I could always keep writing. But I've really struggled with publisher's block.</p>
<p>The more I looked at traditional publishing the more involved it became and the more I didn't like it. As an unknown author it was going to be a bit of a slog to get published. Finding agents, dealing with publishers, pitching my book etc. etc. didn't really float my boat. It also looked like it would take a long time to get the book to market even if I was successful in finding a publisher.</p>
<p>I also discovered that traditional publishers have a lot of control over how the book is marketed and sold. I wanted to be able to offer more than just a book but that wouldn't be possible if I went down the traditional route.</p>
<p>So I decided to self-publish the book but that opened a whole other world of challenges. I've spent many of the recent weeks trying to learn all about self-publishing and getting the book ready for publication. I've learned how to use a number of new software packages that help in the publishing process. I've also invested in many activities such as cover design, book formatting, editing to name a few, just to get to the point where I can think about launching the book.</p>
<p>I'm almost there. I believe that I have written a great book. It's the type of book I wish I had been able to read BEFORE I set up my business. It would have stopped me making the mistakes I made. It would also have saved me significant amounts of money. But more than that. It would have shown me the fast-track to success. It would also have given me the confidence to launch my business earlier than I did. It would have reduced my fears about my abilities to grow a company because I would have known the processes to follow to achieve success.</p>
<p>I now need to remove that final hurdle in my publisher's block. I need that final kick to get me to take the remaining steps to get the book out there. Once I know that there are people out there who want to read my book then that will be the final bit of motivation that I need to work through the publishing process and get the book printed.</p>
<p>I've identified a company that will help me get through the final stages of the self-publishing process. If this campaign is a success I will pay them from the funding and begin working with them immediately. I would hope to get the book printed and ready for distribution within 4-6 weeks after that.</p>
<p>I will keep all backers posted on the final stages of publishing and the expected ship date of the book. In advance of this you will receive an electronic copy of the book so you can begin reading even before the printed book arrives.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>When you back my campaign you will be one of the first people to get a copy of the printed book before it releases to the normal book publishing outlets. And for backers only, I will also add in a digital copy of the book as well as an additional eBook that complements the book - <i>My 21 Growth Hacks</i>. This ebook adds a whole bunch of ideas that you can apply to grow your business. This three-fer is not something that will be offered through any other channel.</p>
<p>I mentioned above that I wanted to be able to offer more than a book. One thing I've always been conscious about is that most How-To books are just the beginning when you are learning something new. My book is full of real nuggets of information and some people will be happy to take those nuggets and go and launch their own software business. But other people will feel they want more hand-holding as they work towards having their own business. </p>
<p>I've already been asked by some people if I will be offering any coaching or mentoring to go along with the book so if this is something that interests you, I've structured some perks to allow you to choose the level of coaching that you would like. I've previously coached developers looking to grow a business and here's what one of my students, Dedrick, said:-</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""I don't think I'll ever outgrow coaching from Paul. He's done exactly what I want to do so he has a wealth of experience. He can see the bad before it happens due to his experience and he can help me check my blind spots. I hope to have check-ins with him even after we are roaring well past our first 7-figure client.""</i></p>
<p>I've also developed an online course that follows the structure of the book. I've narrated this myself and it fleshes out the content of the book in more detail. This course previously sold for up to $10k but as a backer you can access this for a fraction of that cost.</p>
<p>Here are the details of the perks.</p>
<p><i><strong>Action Taker Perk</strong></i></p>
<p>As a first step, you might feel that you need some guidance. You might be nervous or undecided about starting a business. Or you may have questions about the process of starting up. You may have some ideas that need validating. You may be uncertain about whether the skills you have are enough to build a successful business. Whatever it is that needs answering about starting a software development business then you can book a 30-minute call with me. I'll give you the benefit of my experience and aim to guide you on the right path to follow.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main risk in backing any book campaign is this; will the book get written? That is no longer a risk on this campaign as the writing has been done. All 250 pages of it.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge remaining is getting the book published and delivered to the backers. As previously mentioned, I've identified a company that will take me through the final stages of the publishing process so I believe that this challenge will be easily overcome.</p>
<p>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher I use. At the moment this has not been decided on but I will be looking to work with a publisher who can get the book to you within 4-6 weeks after closing this campaign. I'll keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book nears publication. Regardless of this, you will be receiving the digital copy of the book once the final proofing has been signed off. </p>

</div></div>","About This Campaign
I am a former software developer turned entrepreneur. In 1996 I bootstrapped my own software development business out of a spare bedroom and grew it into a multi-million-dollar company. I learned  the hard way, by making many mistakes, how to transition from being a successful developer to a successful businessman.
After 20+ years as the CEO of the business, I sold my stake in the company to my younger business partner who will take it on to the next stage of its life. It was time for me to channel my energy into other projects that I'd always wanted to do. 
During my time as CEO of the business I built up a huge well of knowledge and experience about how to grow and operate a profitable software development business. I knew this knowledge would be very valuable to other developers thinking of starting their own business and I wanted to try and capture it in a book. But I struggled to find the time to do this while I was working.
My exit from the business got me thinking about writing the book. Then Covid-19 came along. It proved to be a great time for me to start the process of capturing my experience in book form. In the region where I live we were put under tight lockdown restrictions for a number of months so I was housebound for much of the time. I used the writing process as a way to keep myself busy during that time. As I got into the writing process I found that it flowed very easily and I really enjoyed it. Over a period of about 6 months and hundreds of hours of writing I managed to get the main manuscript completed.
Since then I've been learning all about book publishing. And what a very confusing world that is. I never really encountered writer's block. I found that I could always keep writing. But I've really struggled with publisher's block.
The more I looked at traditional publishing the more involved it became and the more I didn't like it. As an unknown author it was going to be a bit of a slog to get published. Finding agents, dealing with publishers, pitching my book etc. etc. didn't really float my boat. It also looked like it would take a long time to get the book to market even if I was successful in finding a publisher.
I also discovered that traditional publishers have a lot of control over how the book is marketed and sold. I wanted to be able to offer more than just a book but that wouldn't be possible if I went down the traditional route.
So I decided to self-publish the book but that opened a whole other world of challenges. I've spent many of the recent weeks trying to learn all about self-publishing and getting the book ready for publication. I've learned how to use a number of new software packages that help in the publishing process. I've also invested in many activities such as cover design, book formatting, editing to name a few, just to get to the point where I can think about launching the book.
I'm almost there. I believe that I have written a great book. It's the type of book I wish I had been able to read BEFORE I set up my business. It would have stopped me making the mistakes I made. It would also have saved me significant amounts of money. But more than that. It would have shown me the fast-track to success. It would also have given me the confidence to launch my business earlier than I did. It would have reduced my fears about my abilities to grow a company because I would have known the processes to follow to achieve success.
I now need to remove that final hurdle in my publisher's block. I need that final kick to get me to take the remaining steps to get the book out there. Once I know that there are people out there who want to read my book then that will be the final bit of motivation that I need to work through the publishing process and get the book printed.
I've identified a company that will help me get through the final stages of the self-publishing process. If this campaign is a success I will pay them from the funding and begin working with them immediately. I would hope to get the book printed and ready for distribution within 4-6 weeks after that.
I will keep all backers posted on the final stages of publishing and the expected ship date of the book. In advance of this you will receive an electronic copy of the book so you can begin reading even before the printed book arrives.

What You Get
When you back my campaign you will be one of the first people to get a copy of the printed book before it releases to the normal book publishing outlets. And for backers only, I will also add in a digital copy of the book as well as an additional eBook that complements the book - My 21 Growth Hacks. This ebook adds a whole bunch of ideas that you can apply to grow your business. This three-fer is not something that will be offered through any other channel.
I mentioned above that I wanted to be able to offer more than a book. One thing I've always been conscious about is that most How-To books are just the beginning when you are learning something new. My book is full of real nuggets of information and some people will be happy to take those nuggets and go and launch their own software business. But other people will feel they want more hand-holding as they work towards having their own business. 
I've already been asked by some people if I will be offering any coaching or mentoring to go along with the book so if this is something that interests you, I've structured some perks to allow you to choose the level of coaching that you would like. I've previously coached developers looking to grow a business and here's what one of my students, Dedrick, said:-
""I don't think I'll ever outgrow coaching from Paul. He's done exactly what I want to do so he has a wealth of experience. He can see the bad before it happens due to his experience and he can help me check my blind spots. I hope to have check-ins with him even after we are roaring well past our first 7-figure client.""
I've also developed an online course that follows the structure of the book. I've narrated this myself and it fleshes out the content of the book in more detail. This course previously sold for up to $10k but as a backer you can access this for a fraction of that cost.
Here are the details of the perks.
Action Taker Perk
As a first step, you might feel that you need some guidance. You might be nervous or undecided about starting a business. Or you may have questions about the process of starting up. You may have some ideas that need validating. You may be uncertain about whether the skills you have are enough to build a successful business. Whatever it is that needs answering about starting a software development business then you can book a 30-minute call with me. I'll give you the benefit of my experience and aim to guide you on the right path to follow.

<h3>Present Salvation</h3>
<p>A collaborative book between a visual artist in Seattle and a photographer in the Gambia, West Africa.</p>
<p>The name Present Salvation comes from a play on words combining our two names, Matthew and Essa.</p>
<p>For $15 plus shipping and tax you can help with the printing of this book and have a copy of your own.  A collection of photographs and watercolor illustrations based on Essa's village in the Gambia, West Africa.  The book will contain at least 10 watercolor drawings spread out over 20 pages and several photographs.  The book will also describe the unlikely partnership between Essa and Matthew.</p>
<p>6 months ago, Essa reached out through social media asking for help.  This made me very curious so we started talking through video chats and I learned more about him and his village.  After doing further online research we decided to work on a book together.  We will split the proceeds and the photographer hopes to start a business to support himself and his family, I will use my portion to do the same as well as work on future projects that help other people.  Any extra funds raised will go to Childfund and Interconnections.  Go to my website at <a href=""http://www.mdjenkinsart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mdjenkinsart.com</a> or mdjenkinsart on instagram to see my previous projects and process videos. </p>

<h3>
<br/><strong>Prima di tutto, chi siamo?</strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>1977 è una zine indipendente che si è evoluta dal <a href=""http://1977magazine.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">web</a> alla carta stampata con <a href=""https://www.1977magazine.com/category/magazine/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">un volume annuale autoprodotto</a></strong>, e dalla comunicazione alla <a href=""https://www.1977magazine.com/partners/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">produzione</a> tramite la creazione di eventi, workshop, talk e rassegne. Nata nel 2014, 1977 è una realtà tridimensionale in continua evoluzione, guarda al presente con una visione critica.</p>
<p>Determinazione, senso di appartenenza e spirito di squadra ci hanno permesso di crescere in questi anni, spingendoci a promuovere <strong>un'informazione indipendente, trasversale e inclusiva</strong> . Il 1977 è un anno di rivoluzioni che cambieranno per sempre la storia; allo stesso modo la nostra voce vuole rappresentare una svolta per la riflessione cinematografica e musicale italiana.</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>Perché partecipare a questa campagna?</strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>Per aiutarci a rendere reale <i>1977magazine Vol. V: </i></strong><strong><i>rosso, giallo, blu</i>!</strong></p>
<p>Al suo interno troverete contenuti che indagano il cinema e la musica contemporanei, intesi come luoghi testuali di scambio comunicativo col proprio target, come forme d’arte strettamente interconnesse al contesto storico in cui nascono e si diffondono. Ricondurre l'oggetto filmico o musicale all'interno di un frame socio-culturale di ampio respiro e interrogarlo significa infatti <strong>acquisire gli strumenti essenziali per interpretare il nostro presente</strong>, con uno sguardo consapevole del passato e lungimirante nei confronti del futuro.</p>
<p><i>1977magazine Vol. V</i>: rosso, giallo, blu è diviso in 3 sezioni. <strong>Ogni sezione prende in analisi uno dei tre colori primari, con la sua portata simbolica a livello semiotico, antropologico, sociale ed emotivo</strong>, mettendolo in relazione al suo uso nella musica e nel cinema contemporanei.</p>
<p>Ci fermiamo qui per evitare spoiler e non rovinarvi la sorpresa ;)</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>Qual è il nostro obiettivo?</strong>
</h3>
<p>Crediamo nel valore materico e immanente della carta, per questo i nostri volumi cartacei sono <strong>oggetti di design che perdurano nel tempo e testimoniano una storia</strong>. Ognuno porta con sé il valore dei contenuti culturali che veicola, dei materiali con cui è stato prodotto, dei processi per realizzarlo e delle persone che vi hanno lavorato.</p>
<p>Ogni volume cartaceo di 1977 è una risposta all’esigenza di creare qualcosa di personale che resista alla velocità imperante nell’era digitale. Il nostro obiettivo è quello di conferire un nuovo statuto alla “vecchia” carta: trasformarla in un oggetto prezioso, da conservare e collezionare, che sia ecologico e sostenibile. Per questo la scelta della cadenza annuale, che ci permette di realizzare un prodotto ragionato e altamente curato in tutti i suoi aspetti. E la decisione di stampare utilizzando carta naturale (100 gr) e secondo la filosofia <a href=""http://www.greenprinting.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GreenPrinting</a>, volta alla salvaguardia dell'ambiente attraverso l'uso di <strong>materiali a basso impatto ambientale</strong> e all'utilizzo di <strong>energia rinnovabile e automezzi a metano</strong>.</p>
<p>Fortemente convinti del valore dell'innovazione e delle potenzialità del digitale, determinati a creare un ponte tra passato e presente, i nostri volumi sono riviste che vanno <strong>""oltre la carta""</strong> grazie all’utilizzo della tecnologia dei QR code e della Realtà Aumentata.</p>

<h3>
<br/><strong>Cosa ci serve e cosa otterrai in cambio?</strong>
</h3>
<p>Andiamo al dunque. Per realizzare il nostro prossimo volume cartaceo abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto. Il 2020 ci ha costretti a rinunciare alla nostra pubblicazione annuale, lasciando un vuoto nella nostra storia, ma <strong>il 2021 vogliamo che sia un anno di rinascita</strong> per il mondo intero, e anche per noi.</p>
<p>Stampare secondo la nostra filosofia comporta costi elevati, che in questo momento non riusciamo a sostenere. Ma non vogliamo scendere a compromessi: cambiare la nostra visione significherebbe realizzare un prodotto che non solo sarebbe scadente, ma inquinerebbe il nostro pianeta.</p>
<p>Con un contributo a tua scelta (da piccolissimo a grandissimo!) potremo farcela! E se non raggiungeremo l'obiettivo finale, i fondi saranno comunque destinati a coprire le spese di produzione delle nostre attività. In cambio, riceverai dei pacchetti studiati ad hoc per incontrare le diverse esigenze di chi ci vuole sostenere, con dei gadget dal valore culturale, estetico e funzionale: </p>

We are a PhD graduate teaching assistant & community food

agroforestry and whole-farm planning using permaculture site assessment and

What is a community food forest?

Spanish Version:

Food forests, also known as forest gardens, are edible
perennial landscapes modeled after a young forest ecosystem. They provide an
efficient way to grow food in small spaces and are part of an increasingly
visible local food movement.




Over 80% of the American population
now resides in urban areas. Community food forests are one of many
strategies emerging across the US to reconnect urban populations to sources of
local affordable, nutritious food. They give people an opportunity to shape
their urban landscape into one that nourishes:


their body through producing food,
their mind by giving a place to relax, escape city
     sounds and reconnect with nature
the community by providing a place for creating
     connections with others over producing food together! 

Community food
forests are created when volunteers come together to enliven a space with
edible plants planted to mimic a forest ecosystem. They are generally open to
the public for recreation, relaxing and harvesting fruits, nuts, vegetables and
herbs for free. Volunteering time and effort to maintain the plants is the best
way to give back.







About the Book

We are researching community food forests across the United States to offer holistic planning strategies and best management practices to help current and future initiatives succeed. Currently there is little information out there on how to plan and manage food forests at the community scale and leaders are searching forresources.  
Help us get to as many sites as possible to learn directly from the pioneers of the community food forest movement. We're excited to write a book to share the results of our research and their personal experiences with social design, planning and management of these perennial edible gardens. 
The book will discuss terminology, project management, site design and educational elements, motivations and social movements, partnerships and collaboration considerations, lessons learned and best practices, frameworks for measuring the community food forest as a whole system through different forms of capital and inspirational stories of some of the unique community food forests we visit throughout the country.

During visits and interviews in 2014 there was overwhelming interest from leaders and participants of community food forests in learning more about the design, partnerships, successes and challenges that other sites are experiencing.

<p>Hi, welcome to another installment of Liz's Crazy Ideas. Brought to you by Liz's Overactive Imagination, 3am Insomnia, and Too Much Caffeine.</p>
<p>This has been an idea I have been tossing around for quite some time, and I thought, what better way to celebrate International Women's Day than by going out on a terrifying limb and finally launching Nerd Girl Magazine. Nerd Girl magazine will start off as a 100 page quarterly magazine, supported by small numbers of relevant content and <i>paying for this content.</i> Small at first, and if it works I will expand the print run and the advertising budget so I can pay content providers more. The first run will be limited to 100 unless the unthinkable happens and more than 100 people want to buy a print mag. </p>
<p>Each issue will have a theme, and the theme of the first issue will be a Cosplay theme. I'd like to explore many different sides of Cosplay in this issue, from how exploring alter egos can be healing and wonderful experiences, to the experiences of Cosplayers from different backgrounds, countries, and cultures. Get inspired, and send me your ideas, I can't wait to hear them!<br/><br/><b>Website has been launched!!! </b>There's still a lot of prettying up to do, but here's the basic website: <a href=""http://www.nerdgirlmagazine.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.nerdgirlmagazine.com</a></p>
<p>We're also on Facebook :)</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What you get for your cash:</h3> <p>I am basing this campaign around three things: getting advance orders for the first 100 magazines to be ready by July 2015, spreading the work about Nerd Girl Magazine to get a wide variety of submissions, and signing up advertisers to pay for the content. <br/>There are several different levels of sponsorship; e-zine orders, print magazine orders, annual subscriptions, and then advertising options starting at $30 and working up to $180. Each advertising option is for advertising in one issue of Nerd Girl, and ALL advertising revenue goes back to content providers such as writers, photographic teams, artists, basically anyone who provides content.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I suppose inexperience and lack of funds are the two biggest hurdles I face. Here's more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inexperience: I have never run a mag before. However I have worked as a freelance writer, mostly ghost-writing, creating online content, and writing lifestyle and fashion articles for magazines and blogs, for a number of years. I also have lots of people willing to help me, from those currently running mags, to retired journos, currently working journos, graphic designers, and heaps more. I plan on yelling 'HELP' loudly in their direction when I inevitably get over my head.</li>
<li>Lack of funds: obviously, if this indiegogo thing goes swimmingly, all will be well in that area. I'm going to pull it off either way. If people like my idea and want the mag, I'll keep doing it.</li>
<li>Editing: I'm not a trained editor, but have fallen into editing and proofreading books by virtue of being a grammar nerd. I've helped edit, ghostwrite, and proofread lots of books, documents and essays. I prefer a 'less is more' approach and work closely with the writer to ensure I refine rather than re-write. If you're a fantastic writer, I don't want to mess with that. If you're a fantastic creative with a story that needs to be heard, I have the skill to give your story greater clarity without removing your personality from your writing. </li>
<li>Only being one person: I am not expecting Nerd Girl to go viral, like the Glitterbombing guy. However in one of the other dimensions where it does fluke virality, I will grab all my friends and bribe them with my incredibly good cooking (ok, wine. Lots of wine.) to help me get the first issue out. If the interest continues to grow, I will (gasp) hire or contract some of the many amazingly competent women I know to help me handle everything.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>SUBMIT!!!!! SO I CAN RULE THE WORLD, AND EAT ALL THE RAISINS I WANT!!!</p>
<p>But seriously, submissions are the reason I'm doing this. Send me stuff!! I can't accept everything of course, but I want to hear from you. All of you!!<br/><br/><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The long story, where Liz rants on for hours about her raisin d'etre and other boring things: </h3>
<p><br/>Firstly; I have gone with 'Nerd' over the prettier and more alliterative 'Geek,' because that's what gets flung at you for being smart in Australia, and often is linked to being boring, too intimidating, and undesirable. I'm proud of being a Nerd, and I'd like to see other Nerdy girls being proud of it too. </p>
<p>The magazine has come about after much discussion with women working in a wide cross-section of 'nerdy' industries and careers, and hearing the same tired story from each of them. Over the years, since my mother first saw a massive roomful of computer in 1970s London, and my mother-in-law fought her way to one of the highest paid jobs a woman could hold in her developing post-colonial country, the story hasn't changed much.</p>
<p>Women are actively discouraged from doing Smart things. Girls are teased for getting good marks in school. Engineering, IT, trades, the sciences, law, and many other brilliant careers, are not offered or encouraged, especially if you come across as very girly. Hostility in the workforce is a thing. Women not getting promotions, contracts, full time positions, is a thing. Women not getting jobs at all is a thing. </p>
<p>And outside jobs and careers, the wide cultural explosion of Geek is often hostile as well. From cosplayers who get groped at conventions, to women who hide their identities in the gaming world so as to be related to as people rather than a set of breasts with little intellectual ability, culturally the nerdy world is pretty anti-female. This is changing. Perhaps this little mag can be a small part of that change. At least we can publish some cosplay that isn't just all Sexy Wimmin Being Sexy.

<p>So my goal with Nerd Girl, is to open some discussions, create a platform, and start allowing women to tell some stories of their own.

<p>Now, before you get all #notallmen at me, please take your own personal outrage outside. I'm not running a we-hate-men magazine. In fact, this magazine wouldn't even be on the table if I didn't have the excellent example of at least four amazingly supportive men. <br/><br/>My father, who always told my three sisters and myself we could do anything, and believed it.

And last but not least, my husband, who encourages me to do stupid things like this on a regular basis. <br/><br/> These men change history along with us, and I encourage men who do these things for their wives, daughters, and women around them, to write and send in empowering content as well. We are all in this together, and this issue hurts us all.</p>

</div></div>","What is this 'Nerd Girl?' 
Hi, welcome to another installment of Liz's Crazy Ideas. Brought to you by Liz's Overactive Imagination, 3am Insomnia, and Too Much Caffeine.
This has been an idea I have been tossing around for quite some time, and I thought, what better way to celebrate International Women's Day than by going out on a terrifying limb and finally launching Nerd Girl Magazine. Nerd Girl magazine will start off as a 100 page quarterly magazine, supported by small numbers of relevant content and paying for this content. Small at first, and if it works I will expand the print run and the advertising budget so I can pay content providers more. The first run will be limited to 100 unless the unthinkable happens and more than 100 people want to buy a print mag. 
Each issue will have a theme, and the theme of the first issue will be a Cosplay theme. I'd like to explore many different sides of Cosplay in this issue, from how exploring alter egos can be healing and wonderful experiences, to the experiences of Cosplayers from different backgrounds, countries, and cultures. Get inspired, and send me your ideas, I can't wait to hear them!Website has been launched!!! There's still a lot of prettying up to do, but here's the basic website: www.nerdgirlmagazine.com
We're also on Facebook :)
   What you get for your cash: I am basing this campaign around three things: getting advance orders for the first 100 magazines to be ready by July 2015, spreading the work about Nerd Girl Magazine to get a wide variety of submissions, and signing up advertisers to pay for the content. There are several different levels of sponsorship; e-zine orders, print magazine orders, annual subscriptions, and then advertising options starting at $30 and working up to $180. Each advertising option is for advertising in one issue of Nerd Girl, and ALL advertising revenue goes back to content providers such as writers, photographic teams, artists, basically anyone who provides content.


Risks & Challenges
I suppose inexperience and lack of funds are the two biggest hurdles I face. Here's more:

Inexperience: I have never run a mag before. However I have worked as a freelance writer, mostly ghost-writing, creating online content, and writing lifestyle and fashion articles for magazines and blogs, for a number of years. I also have lots of people willing to help me, from those currently running mags, to retired journos, currently working journos, graphic designers, and heaps more. I plan on yelling 'HELP' loudly in their direction when I inevitably get over my head.
Lack of funds: obviously, if this indiegogo thing goes swimmingly, all will be well in that area. I'm going to pull it off either way. If people like my idea and want the mag, I'll keep doing it.
Editing: I'm not a trained editor, but have fallen into editing and proofreading books by virtue of being a grammar nerd. I've helped edit, ghostwrite, and proofread lots of books, documents and essays. I prefer a 'less is more' approach and work closely with the writer to ensure I refine rather than re-write. If you're a fantastic writer, I don't want to mess with that. If you're a fantastic creative with a story that needs to be heard, I have the skill to give your story greater clarity without removing your personality from your writing. 
Only being one person: I am not expecting Nerd Girl to go viral, like the Glitterbombing guy. However in one of the other dimensions where it does fluke virality, I will grab all my friends and bribe them with my incredibly good cooking (ok, wine. Lots of wine.) to help me get the first issue out. If the interest continues to grow, I will (gasp) hire or contract some of the many amazingly competent women I know to help me handle everything.



Other Ways You Can Help
SUBMIT!!!!! SO I CAN RULE THE WORLD, AND EAT ALL THE RAISINS I WANT!!!
But seriously, submissions are the reason I'm doing this. Send me stuff!! I can't accept everything of course, but I want to hear from you. All of you!!
    The long story, where Liz rants on for hours about her raisin d'etre and other boring things: 
Firstly; I have gone with 'Nerd' over the prettier and more alliterative 'Geek,' because that's what gets flung at you for being smart in Australia, and often is linked to being boring, too intimidating, and undesirable. I'm proud of being a Nerd, and I'd like to see other Nerdy girls being proud of it too. 
The magazine has come about after much discussion with women working in a wide cross-section of 'nerdy' industries and careers, and hearing the same tired story from each of them. Over the years, since my mother first saw a massive roomful of computer in 1970s London, and my mother-in-law fought her way to one of the highest paid jobs a woman could hold in her developing post-colonial country, the story hasn't changed much.
Women are actively discouraged from doing Smart things. Girls are teased for getting good marks in school. Engineering, IT, trades, the sciences, law, and many other brilliant careers, are not offered or encouraged, especially if you come across as very girly. Hostility in the workforce is a thing. Women not getting promotions, contracts, full time positions, is a thing. Women not getting jobs at all is a thing. 
And outside jobs and careers, the wide cultural explosion of Geek is often hostile as well. From cosplayers who get groped at conventions, to women who hide their identities in the gaming world so as to be related to as people rather than a set of breasts with little intellectual ability, culturally the nerdy world is pretty anti-female. This is changing. Perhaps this little mag can be a small part of that change. At least we can publish some cosplay that isn't just all Sexy Wimmin Being Sexy. Although sexy women are certainly encouraged to submit work as well!!
So my goal with Nerd Girl, is to open some discussions, create a platform, and start allowing women to tell some stories of their own. Often we don't get to tell our story, because the men who run magazines, while well meaning and perhaps not realizing they are doing this, discount or ignore our stories because they do not personally connect with them. Oh, and I also want to pay people for their content. Crazy, I know. But the whole movement of print media into not paying for content irritates me. We'll see whether I can pull it off. 
Now, before you get all #notallmen at me, please take your own personal outrage outside. I'm not running a we-hate-men magazine. In fact, this magazine wouldn't even be on the table if I didn't have the excellent example of at least four amazingly supportive men. My father, who always told my three sisters and myself we could do anything, and believed it. My grandfather, who took great care to answer all my questions and pull out reference books whenever I found a weird sea creature, and my father in law, who looked after the home & kids, in spite of ridicule from everyone he knew, so my mother in law could work. And last but not least, my husband, who encourages me to do stupid things like this on a regular basis.  These men change history along with us, and I encourage men who do these things for their wives, daughters, and women around them, to write and send in empowering content as well. We are all in this together, and this issue hurts us all.
One more thing: I'd love to have submissions from women of all cultures, countries, and backgrounds. Feminism is for everyone. If you identify as female, or like to support and encourage people who identify as female, send in what your thoughts are!
I could talk on and on and on about this for ages, but I'll leave it there. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions or if you'd like to know more about Nerd Girl. Website with more coming soon...

<p><i>The Descendants</i> will be a rollercoaster ride of fun and adventure and we have many wonderful artists who’s work will shine through the pages of the series.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>First and foremost, we are trying to raise funds so we can properly pay our artists. If you are an artist, or know an artist, then you know how frustrating it can be when people expect you to ""art"" for them for free. We don't believe anyone should have to work for free.</p>
<p>The way we figure it:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$1,200 for artists</li>
<li>$1,200 for writers</li>
<li>$400 for perks</li>
<li>$200 for Indiegogo fees</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Everyone will get a special prequel episode to the series as a free download before it becomes available to the public, and when the series premiers in fall, you will also get the series premier as a free download. Other perks come with different tiers. But, no matter what you contribute you get to read some of it, which is the whole point. We want to get people back into reading.</p>

Artists will need to finish their illustrations and publications will need to be formatted and writing will need to be refined, but if everything goes according to plan, we should launch on schedule, which will hopefully be in the fall.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why You Should Care</h3>
<p>Reading is the the most time tested and respected way to tell a story and I fear we are losing it. This world bombards us with pictures and ads and videos and sounds and people these days have the attention span of a gnat and really, we have lost our respect for the written word. </p>
<p>I want to change that.</p>
<p>And I know deep down you do too.</p>
<p>What if for the cost of a hardcover book you had a subscription to a beautifully illustrated, entertaining, online novel at your disposal, to be downloaded on all your devices for months to come? </p>
<p>What if we lived in a society that got excited about the next episode of a weekly novel? That set aside their Thursday night for family reading time or they pop a bowl of popcorn to enjoy on the couch while reading the next episode?<br/></p>
<p>By combining the best of the digital age with the classic wisdom that's borne from reading a good book, we hope to get people excited about reading again, and be a part of creating something new and wonderful.<br/></p>

<p></p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p></p>
<h4>How will <i>The Descendants</i> be distributed?</h4>
<p>The releases would follow a pattern similar to a television series, a ""season"" getting released with an episode per week for a set number of weeks out of the year.</p>
<p>You will either be able to buy and download individual episodes or buy a season pass and get notifications when new episodes become available for download.</p>
<h4>How long will they be?</h4>
<p>The goal of this point is to make it easy for people to get back into the habit of reading. So there is a simple formula we will follow.</p>
<p>People read an average of 300 words per minute.</p>
<p>So if the episodes are around 5,000 to 7,000 words, plus pictures, it should take the average person under half an hour to finish.</p>
<p>Each season will have twelve episodes.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>How much will they cost?</h4>
<p>A single episode will cost $1.50</p>
<p>A season pass will cost $15</p>

   Our Series The Descendants

Synopsis:
“Set on a world apart from ours, the series initially follows five narrators, a half-elf named Alexandria, a doctor named Ron, a pirate named Jack, a bounty hunter named Halazar, and a female security officer for Scarab Corp. named Kyle.
The world’s technology is powered by mysterious powerstones. Everything from vehicles to houses to weapons are all powered by these small crystals. Though generally only used as power sources for technology, there are those individuals that can harness the power of the stones for their own physical use, they are known as manipulators.
The most famous of those with this power are the Knights of the Old Code, a group that follows the old code of chivalry and attempts to use their powers garnered from the stones for the betterment of mankind. They worked closely with the Empire’s government for many, many years.
However, the king of the continent wide Empire inexplicably stamped out The Old Code and its followers by destroying the temple in the capitol city of Terrnog and killing most of the knights. This event became known to history as The Purge.
The story picks up many years later as Alexandria is attempting to shuttle the most powerful powerstone in history to a safe place where it will be out of reach of the king and his Empire. But the Empire may not be what it seems, and this stone may hold more secrets and be more powerful than anyone could ever imagine.”
The Descendants will be a rollercoaster ride of fun and adventure and we have many wonderful artists who’s work will shine through the pages of the series.
    What We Need First and foremost, we are trying to raise funds so we can properly pay our artists. If you are an artist, or know an artist, then you know how frustrating it can be when people expect you to ""art"" for them for free. We don't believe anyone should have to work for free.
The way we figure it:


$1,200 for artists
$1,200 for writers
$400 for perks
$200 for Indiegogo fees


What You Get
Everyone will get a special prequel episode to the series as a free download before it becomes available to the public, and when the series premiers in fall, you will also get the series premier as a free download. Other perks come with different tiers. But, no matter what you contribute you get to read some of it, which is the whole point. We want to get people back into reading.
Get This For Free!

And you can read an excerpt of it right now! Get it here!
    Risks & Challenges It's not all daisies and green tea, there could be set backs. Artists will need to finish their illustrations and publications will need to be formatted and writing will need to be refined, but if everything goes according to plan, we should launch on schedule, which will hopefully be in the fall.

Why You Should Care
Reading is the the most time tested and respected way to tell a story and I fear we are losing it. This world bombards us with pictures and ads and videos and sounds and people these days have the attention span of a gnat and really, we have lost our respect for the written word. 
I want to change that.
And I know deep down you do too.
What if for the cost of a hardcover book you had a subscription to a beautifully illustrated, entertaining, online novel at your disposal, to be downloaded on all your devices for months to come? 
What if we lived in a society that got excited about the next episode of a weekly novel? That set aside their Thursday night for family reading time or they pop a bowl of popcorn to enjoy on the couch while reading the next episode?
By combining the best of the digital age with the classic wisdom that's borne from reading a good book, we hope to get people excited about reading again, and be a part of creating something new and wonderful.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute we completely understand. But any publicity will help, so tell your friends, your hairdresser, your dog, your prison guard, anyone! It is much appreciated!

FAQ

How will The Descendants be distributed?
The releases would follow a pattern similar to a television series, a ""season"" getting released with an episode per week for a set number of weeks out of the year.
You will either be able to buy and download individual episodes or buy a season pass and get notifications when new episodes become available for download.
How long will they be?
The goal of this point is to make it easy for people to get back into the habit of reading. So there is a simple formula we will follow.
People read an average of 300 words per minute.
So if the episodes are around 5,000 to 7,000 words, plus pictures, it should take the average person under half an hour to finish.
Each season will have twelve episodes.

How much will they cost?
A single episode will cost $1.50
A season pass will cost $15",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I Am Bad Whether is a press that encourages feisty, fierce voices from all walks of life. Some of the work we publish will be explicitly political; some of it won't.

We celebrate the activists, the rabblerousers, and those that just don't fit in. We revel in your badness, the way you refuse to conform. I Am Bad Whether seeks to bolster those voices that have been told to be quiet, to act ladylike. It's an inclusive literary space for all voices. <br/></p>
<p>Although the gender parity in literary publishing has made some headway, women are still underrepresented in traditional publishing. The 2014 VIDA Count shows that while for some publishers, things are improving, we still have a long way to go before women are fully represented (<a href=""http://www.vidaweb.org/2014-vida-count/#The"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.vidaweb.org/2014-vida-count/#The</a> 2014 VIDA Count Overall).

<p>Your support will contribute to a press devoted to increasing the representation of women in all genres of writing, as well as a commitment to diversity. We're tired of the ways in which even mainstream feminism tends to be exclusionary. We don't believe in the concept of <i>emerging voices</i>.

After helping with the initial crowdfunding release, Allyson Whipple is excited to lend her skill set to further development of the press. She has a work background in e-publishing, as well as working for small businesses in Austin. Through her work experience, she has the insight and skills to help the press make money and become a viable part of the larger feminist community.     Other Ways You Can Help Want to contribute, but lack the resources to do so?

</div></div>","Brief review 
For far too long the voices of Indigenous communities have been silenced. Help provide four Indigenous leaders from different regions of Mexico a
platform so they can be heard by the world! On September 25th in Geneva,
Switzerland the United Nations is hosting the 30th session of the
human rights council where they'll be holding a
parallel discussion on Indigenous people.
We are Pro Mazahua and Pro Mexico Indigena, two
organizations that work for the integral development
of the indigenous communities of Mexico with a clear and strong commitment
towards strengthening the greatness of Mexico’s native people through an
integral sustainable development model which is divided into 4 areas: 


physical-environmental
economic-productive
social-humane

civic-cultural; 


We are proud to communicate that  we' ve been selected to provide testimony at the conference.


Our plan is to send four leaders of indigenous communities to speak for their selves: 



Manuela Alberto Flores, of the
indigenous Mazahua of Chonteje community, municipality of San Felipe del Progreso,
Mexico State. She has worked with Pro Mazahua since 2009 and has participated
in several events and meetings they have organized with different venues. She
is an active community leader.






Yazmin Martinez Lopez, of the indigenous Otomi community of Tixmadeje, Acambay municipality,
State of Mexico. She is a young, spirited and talented woman who sets an example
in the work we’ve done with her community.






Maria Margarita Dzib Caamal, of the indigenous Mayan community of Katab in
Campeche. She is fluent both in her mayan native dialect and in spanish, and uses this to tirelessly empower her culture.










Don Manuel Guzman Gomez, of the indigenous Tseltal community of Kotolte
in Chiapas. He is a traditional physician and the indigenous chairman of Pro Tseltal that works with 30
communities and promotes
the Tseltal culture.






Call to action

These four leaders need your
help to spread their
testimony to the world! They are looking for financial assistance to
provide for their passports, airfare, lodging and living expenses while staying
in Switzerland. The total expense is an estimated of 13,620. They will be going to the U.N. to provide
testimony on their culture, the progress they’ve witnessed in
their communities, their
way of being, living and thinking, and the work that still needs to be done for
the resurgence of indigenous people in their greatness. Please share and
donate what you can and help the original nations of Mexico usher in a new era
of peace and success. We don’t
have much time and we’ll
appreciate your help!
   What we need

We need $ 13,620 to meet our goal.
Every Indigenous leader requires $ 3,405 in expenses, which include:



Passport $ 70


Transfer $ 2,100

Accommodation for three nights $ 675
Travel expenses (taxis, food) $ 380
Translator $180

Every extra donation above our goal will go directly to the organizations Pro Mazahua and Pro México Indígena so they can continue their great work in the
development of indigenous communities.

If we reach the goal we will provide 10% of the total order to the nonprofit Social Brick to help them to continue growing and developing
successful fundraising campaigns for social causes.


Perks
Indigenous communities have made a big effort to  provide rewards for generous donors. Any reward is handmade by different indigenous people of Mexico. What better in addition to helping with the donation if we can promote the development of our brethren by their products!

    Risks and Challenges We are working with a flexible plan so we are going to take the number of indigenous leaders by the amount collected at the end of the deadline by which all aid is totally useful!
We have very little time! But we rely on the generosity of people. Any help is important! Also sharing this project in social networks can help us a lot! This is an opportunity for our Indigenous community to be heard and valued and we can support them!

<p><i>""I was extremely nervous about the retreat because <b>I didn't have any money </b> to pay for the tuition or travel. I was worried it wouldn't be possible, then I found out that TWH fundraised enough money to offer scholarships and I was a recipient of The George Rufus Lindsey Scholarship. That was a breath of fresh air. All I had to worry about was getting there and a poet stepped up and paid for my entire bus travel round-trip. When I arrived I felt right at home and left with an entire tribe of good writers who are great people. Everyone was open to conversations, networking, sharing work, and <b>medicine hugs</b>. I left the retreat feeling more driven to build my craft and become a better writer, reader, and person. I LOVE THE WATERING HOLE and can't wait to see my family next year.""</i></p>

We now have 52 fellows and more than 500 members. This has all been a grassroots movement, prompted by two ladies, Candace and Monifa, who felt isolated and underfed in the Carolina poetry landscape. These women decided to create the very thing they needed by hosting a retreat in 2013 with Tyehimba Jess, Remica Bingham Risher, and Lita Hooper and dozens of poets. After overwhelming success of this first venture, we launched a series of Online Masterclasses with the core tenets of affordability and accessibility in mind. The objective was to reach poets regardless of location and personal situation (finances, babysitters, etc.). Our following retreat with Nikky Finney, Frank X Walker, Roger Bonair-Agard, and Mariahadessa Ekere Tallie was equally a blessing and a result of your support last year. (We surpassed our funding goal!) We had an influx of applications, standing scholarships, and were able to open more spaces for poets.

So being able to come together and finally meet one another on a lake in some cabins, cooking for one another and staying up swapping books and the black cultural aesthetic was like a family reunion-style poetry retreat model I never experienced before.""",4.0,0,"3 Campaigns
