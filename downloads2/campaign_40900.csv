<br/><h3>The
Mesoamerican Reef: A Delicate Caribbean Treasure</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
Mesoamerican Reef (MAR) region lies within the Caribbean Sea and touches the
coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras. <span>It
contains the largest barrier reef in the Western Hemisphere, stretching
nearly 700 miles from the northern tip of the Yucatan Peninsula down through the
Honduran Bay Islands. Dazzling arrays of different types of coral form this
underwater wilderness, and provide home and food to hundreds of species of fish,
marine turtles, and sharks. Along the shores, mangroves provide habitat for
fish and shorebirds as well as protect coastal areas from the damage associated
with hurricanes and strong storms.</span></p>
<span></span>

<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>This
unique paradise, however, is in danger. Eight million pieces of marine debris
enter the ocean every day and up to 10% of that waste is plastic (15% in USA).
In the MAR region, dumping domestic waste in open areas is a common behavior;
this waste ends up in the reef through river runoffs, dumps, poorly managed
landfills, storm water discharge, wrecks and drain systems becoming a
major problem that threatens the health and biodiversity of the reef<span>.</span></p>

Nutrient-packed, organism-rich compost is the most effective substance (known
to man) at improving soil, protecting and conserving our water, and reducing harmful greenhouse
gases. Right now, our compost production is limited to how much food waste we
can haul to the closest commercial composting facility – over 40 miles outside
of the city! Do you see the problem?
The solution is to go local! We are raising these funds
to purchase state-of-the-art composting technology that will allow us to process food scraps
and disposable tableware made from plants (not plastic) that we currently collect from our customers. This is a
landmark effort to bring commercial composting to urban centers and to
introduce this new and innovative
way for managing our organic waste.Fundraising Goal // What's in it for me?We are raising $25k to expand our composting services within the Pasadena, CA area. This traction will ensure we are properly recognized and considered by CalRecycle (http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov) for their upcoming grant supporting the development of composting facilities. To accomplish this, we will be using the funds to expand our marketing efforts, purchase equipment, and pay our team.   
We are still in the bootstrapping stage of our operations. Most would have given up, but we are convinced this problem is too grave to ignore.  We have come along way to increase awareness!  Beginning as a female solopreneur, the team is now 10 people strong, comprised of extremely talented people and industry professionals. They have been working incredibly hard without pay, and finally we've gained community and government support. The state of California has recognized the urgent need for
more composting facilities.  They are
making available $15M in grant funding to build out more infrastructure. We've proven ourselves in the community over
the years, and have an all-star team that is dedicated to this project. We've educated our local government representatives and gained recognition from both local
and state officials. 
Will you support our existing team
of experts and professionals already working on the project to bring about this
vision for a cleaner, more sustainable world? By signing up for residential composting service, or any of the other perks (for non-Pasadena, CA residents) it will keep alive the team we have
now, and accelerate
our efforts to raise the investment capital needed to continue our journey and  to fulfill our vision!Other Ways You Can Help

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p></p>
<p>There
are a variety of reasons why whales strand themselves, so the goal of this
database is to learn as much as possible about human-caused strandings.
Typically, these include loud noises produced by industrial practices, military
exercises or research conducted in the cetaceans' habitat. </p>
<p>Whales
and dolphins process sound as visual images -- so any loud bursts of sound
caused by seismic oil exploration for example, is a multi-sensory overload for
them. On just one ship, there can be 90 or more 200-300 decibel air guns firing
simultaneously every 20 to 30 seconds, for months on end. </p>
<p>The
effects of this sound can be profound on cetaceans and lead to blast type
injuries or drastic alteration in dive behavior. Bleeding in the brain, ear
canal, and melon (the forehead), is characteristic of whales and dolphins who
beach themselves following exposure to loud sounds. </p>
<p>The
continuous onslaught of sound can also make it difficult for family members to
find other pod members in the din. This furthers the chance that pods will
intermingle in assemblages not characteristic for them, or find themselves
without a pod leader. There is even a chance that in attempting to escape the
worst of the sound, dolphins and whales may flee to unfamiliar areas and find
themselves lost.</p>

To

Sound is one of the biggest problems for marine animals, and now sonar has conclusively been demonstrated to cause whales and dolphins to strand. 

The Problem

There
are a variety of reasons why whales strand themselves, so the goal of this

For the first 16 months of her life, she was placed in a couple of different orphanages and then into 2 foster families. After getting sick as a toddler, she was brought to the hospital and it was there that she caught the attention of the Lutheran Family Services adoption organization and subsequently adopted by Maynard and Vicki Shigley. The Shigley family had adopted a baby boy from Vietnam and knew it was time to bring in a sister.</p><p>Although Brandi was abandoned as a baby, one things she knows for certain is that she was loved. Pictures of her in the orphanage show her being surrounded by happy smiling people. When she was brought over to Denver, Colorado, the love continued.</p><p>“Being adopted was one of the best things that could have happened to me. I grew up in a family that showed me no limits! They supported, and continue to support, every ounce of creativity in me and giving me the freedom to explore all creative sides of me. This in turn has given me courage and the passion to support and encourage other people to let their lights shine.”</p><p>When Brandi was 23, she wanted to find out what time she was born. She went down to her files (which she had always had access to, but never cared to look) and discovered letters upon letters that her foster mother had written to the Shigleys, describing her personality, what her first word was (“light”) and the many details of her character. She finally found her birth certificate, discovering that her biological mother was 23 when she had her and that she was born at 2:23. She learned of her parents names (Manuel Gonzales and Erlinda Ignacio) and learned that she had a sibling and that her parents were catholic and her dad was a soldier, orginally born in Zamboanga. It was that night that she realized, “It doesn’t matter what chromosomes make me me, it’s up to me to be me.”</p><p>The year she turned 23 she started her first business, graduated from college with honors in communication and became a citizen, truly planting her own roots. The number 23 and 2:23 show up in Brandi’s life on a regular basis always reminding her that she is on the right path.</p><p>“To be on this mission to take water filters down to the Philippines is a dream come true. I’ve always wanted to explore my roots and see where I’m from, but I’ve also been afraid. It’s time to stop being afraid. To go down there with my friend Sammy (also an adopted Filipino) and such a wonderful crew to do something that will directly and positively do good in communities affected by the typhoon, makes my heart explode with love. I know that it will be emotional for me. But I’m ready.”</p><p><b>Norm Villapando</b></p><p>Originally from Honolulu Hawaii, Norm moved to Colorado to attend CU in Boulder and obtained both a BA and MBA while at CU.

<br/><p><b>Why Money Would Help</b></p>
<p>In the past, money has been the limiting factor, but with living expenses paid for, we will be able to focus entirely on this project.</p>
<p>Maintaining and developing is a full time job to run Mountain Gardens for Joe and the apprentices. Because there is a lot of time involved in organizing, filming and editing the videos, much of the filming and editing will need to be done in the early mornings, late afternoons and on weekends. This scarcely leaves time for earning money on or off the property, which is a current necessity, for Jennifer in particular. </p>
<p>A secondary expense is for a laptop. Currently Jennifer is editing using a 27 inch desktop computer--an impractical computer to be using here at Mountain Gardens, which is run on solar. It's important to note that right now, each 5-10 minute video requires approximately 3 hours of compressing and uploading. The portability of a laptop would also allow Jennifer to edit and upload more quickly and efficiently in other locations. </p>
<p>The other expense is for a macro lens. This would greatly enhance the educational and artistic aspects of this project. The current 50mm lens we are using limits how closely we can show the plant and all its parts. Incorporating extreme closeups would create an all around more engaging video for the viewer.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of where the money will go:</p>
<p>$2,700 will go to Jennifer for bills and living expenses into the winter months.</p>
<p>$1,800 will be used for equipment.</p>
<p>$900 will go to Mountain Gardens, to supplement for the perks we are offering, and to help Joe pay for other expenses that may come up in this growing season.</p>
<p>If we are not able to raise $5,400, the project will be downsized accordingly.</p>

<p><b>The Perks</b></p>
<p>We have a number of exciting perks to offer.  You can view all of them in the side panel, but I would like to discuss one that involves you in the actual project!</p>
<p>At the $108 level, you will have the opportunity to either choose a topic for one of our weekly videos, based on a list of potential topics. (If there is something you are interested in that is not on the list, please contact us and we will let you know if it is an option). Your video of choice can also be a plant video about a plant that is not on the list, as long as it is in the garden or in the nearby woods.</p>

The other expense is for a macro lens. This would greatly enhance the educational and artistic aspects of this project. The current 50mm lens we are using limits how closely we can show the plant and all its parts. Incorporating extreme closeups would create an all around more engaging video for the viewer.
Here is a breakdown of where the money will go:
$2,700 will go to Jennifer for bills and living expenses into the winter months.
$1,800 will be used for equipment.
$900 will go to Mountain Gardens, to supplement for the perks we are offering, and to help Joe pay for other expenses that may come up in this growing season.
If we are not able to raise $5,400, the project will be downsized accordingly.


The Perks
We have a number of exciting perks to offer.  You can view all of them in the side panel, but I would like to discuss one that involves you in the actual project!
At the $108 level, you will have the opportunity to either choose a topic for one of our weekly videos, based on a list of potential topics. (If there is something you are interested in that is not on the list, please contact us and we will let you know if it is an option). Your video of choice can also be a plant video about a plant that is not on the list, as long as it is in the garden or in the nearby woods.
Thank you for your support! We encourage you to share this with anyone you think might also be interested!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Marilene is a Washington State University Livestock Advisor as well as Master Gardener. She is a certified Permaculture Designer and teacher. Marilene is also a professional herbalist with a background in planetary herbology. </p>
<h3>The Intention</h3>
<p>When the Shire is in their care, the Richardsons will continue to preserve it's delicate ecosystem, yet continue to make it available to others through careful stewardship and community programs such as Snohomish Children's Peace Village. In addition, they intend to grow traditional chinese herbs, perennial foods and create a demonstration garden of local indigenous edible plants. They intend for this property to be used for education, farming and forestry stewardship. Each area will be maintained in such a way to not negatively impact the existing landscape or ecosystem, and rather enhance and conserve its natural state. </p>
<div>
<h3>What is the Shire?</h3>
</div>
<p>The ""Shire"" is a pristine 4-acre landscape of rolling green meadows surrounded by second-growth cedar and hemlock trees. It provides an essential natural habitat for local species like fox, deer, bobcat, cougar, and other wildlife that depnd on the meadow's resources to survive. Beyond its ecological significance, the Shire provides a vibrant community space to bring people together to inspire, to love, and to cherish the earth and all its living things.</p>
<p>The Snohomish Children's Peace Village, one of the many community workshops held here, brings kids together through art, music, and play while encouraging values of peace, social justice, and environmental education. SongCroft Self Sufficiency Skills School joins children and adults in learning about permaculture, wild edible foods, and herbal medicinces to promote essential knowledge on living off the land in harmony with local ecological systems. Wolf College and Fish Camp also take place on this sacred piece of land, teaching earth skills and fishing lessons to local children. </p>
<h3>Saving the Shire</h3>
<p>This beautiful land is in danger of being developed, threatening the local ecology and terminating the various community events held on its grounds. We need your help to regain the Shire for our community and our environment. Every little bit helps! Our goal is $98,500, which would ensure the ecological conservation of the land and the continuance of community gatherings that connect individuals with each other and the land. </p>
<p>If we do not reach the goal to purchase this property, our intention is to lease it, long-term.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need $98,500 to purchase the Shire and place a yurt on it for retreat gatherings. </p>
<p>Breakdown of Costs are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>$90,500. Purchase of the Shire</li>
<li>$6,000. Yurt</li>
<li>$1,300 Yurt platform</li>
<li>$500 Portable fening for sheep</li>

<h3>
<em>Continental Divide: Wildlife, People and the Border Wall</em> is a collection of photos and stories about the wildlife and people of the US-Mexico borderlands.</h3>
<h3>Congress needs to know how current policy is destroying wildlife corridors, habitat and human communities--especially now that the recent election has sparked talk of immigration reform.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3> Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a photographer and writer and have been documenting the wildlife and people of the US-Mexico borderlands for that past 8 years. My book, <em>Continental Divide: Wildlife, People and the Border Wall</em> is a collection of photos and stories about the borderlands, and the impact US immigration and border policy are having on them.</p>
<p>Congress may soon be taking up immigration reform and it is very likely some members will try to demand additional border wall, roads, military bases and other infrastructure in exchange for reform. They will ask for the same enforcement measures that have been devastating borderlands ecosystems and communities for the past two decades. </p>
<p>Help me help them understand how precious this region is--one of the most biodiverse places on the continent, home to jaguars, bighorn sheep, ocelots and pronghorn, and many others who are dependent on the US government finding a better solution than walls, roads and batallions of border patrol in our national parks, wilderness and wildlife refuges. </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Help me bring the borderlands to Congress</li>
<li>One copy of Continental Divide to every member</li>
<li>Immigration policy has determined the fate of the borderlands for the past two decades--Congress needs to understand this better before they decide what happens now.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>For your donation you get:</h3>
<p>To bring the borderlands to Congress I need $10,000. I can buy the books for $18 per book which, multiplied by 535 members of Congress = $9630 + shipping costs from my publisher.</p>
<p>Here's what you get in return!</p>
<p><strong>For people who donate $10 </strong>I well send out a photo-tweet/facebook photo to you! You will also get a big bucket of thanks on behalf of borderlands wildlife and ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>If you can donate $35</strong> a ""Postcard from the Borderlands"" and a photo-tweet, along with some sweet satisfaction that you have helped edumacate Congress.</p>
<p><strong>If you can give $75,</strong> I will send you a signed copy of Continental Divide and a ""Postcard from the Borderlands""  along with some sweet satisfaction that you have helped edumacate Congress.</p>
<p><strong>For $150:</strong>  You will get an 8x12 print of a photo from the book, and I will send you a signed copy of Continental Divide, along with some sweet satisfaction that you have helped edumacate Congress.</p>

<p><strong>For $1000</strong>: I will immortalize you by including your name in the acknowledgement section of the next printing of Continental Divide. I will also send you a signed copy of Continental Divide, along with some sweet satisfaction that you have helped edumacate Congress.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If I don't meet my goal</strong>: I will use the funds that I do raise to buy books strategically for key members of the House and Senate. Swing votes on borderlands protection will be targeted and prioritized.</p>

</h2>
<p>The newest project by the Affording Hope Project is The Carnival de Resistance- a travelling arts carnival, a village demonstration project, and a school for cultural transformation around the themes of environmental-economic justice, resistance, and radical theology.  The initial run of the Carnival will happen this coming fall and will take place in two locations - Harrisonburg VA - Sept. 13th - Sept. 22nd and Charlottesville VA - Sept 26th - Oct. 6th. In each location we will fill two weekends with experimental theater, live music, ceremony, street art and other forms of community celebration. The weekdays, in between, will focus on service projects, social engagement, education, skill sharing, craft and creative play.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 150px;""><strong>A Mobile Carnival World:</strong></h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;"">   <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8533/8638337212_4375563dc7_m.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>     </p>
<p>Members of the Carnival Crew, a group of up to 30 will live, work, and travel together- collectively manifesting the vision of this project. Together, they will build the village, the outdoor Carnival venue and the Carnival midway. They will animate the Carnival midway, which teaches and entertains with roving performers, face-painters, story-tellers, a mask-making station, interactive installations, and clever twists on old Carnival games. The Carnival Crew will present four unique multimedia productions, each exploring one of the four elements (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water) and invite people to interact with these powerful symbols.</p>
<p>But most importantly, the members of the Carnival Crew will spread throughout the community to offer their unique gifts and support the programming of local organizations. According to the needs and interests of our local allies, we would like to paint murals and work on community gardens; offer workshops in bike repair, drumming, puppet-making, soap-making; help with stream clean-ups and political demonstrations, host story-telling circles for our elders and local food potlucks for all.

<p>A temporary village will be constructed to form the foundation for the events, modeling radical simplicity and sustainable alternatives.  We will consciously look at energy consumption in regard to transportation, food, waste management, footprint on the land and strain on the larger community.  This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using repurposed material to build camp structures and production material (puppets, props, costumes, stage, set pieces, etc)</li>
<li>Cooking together (with food gleaned from local food sources) with solar ovens and rocket stoves, to diminish use of fossil fuels.</li>
<li>Travelling by bicycle and a veggie-oil bus.</li>
<li>Powering our event sound system with bicycle generators.</li>
<li>Practicing conflict transformation and transparency within the group.</li>
<li>Operating in the gift economy, with meals that are open to the public, no admission to the events, and freely shared resources and relationships</li>
</ul><p>The Carnival will offer models of life-giving earth care practices that provide for practical needs within our communities.  At the same time, we are embodying a spirituality that is tied to the health of the Earth- a spirituality that has been fueling resistance work for generations. We hope to reinvigorate local leaders and rouse communities, inspiring those new to resistance work and encouraging those who have been holding the torch for some time.

The newest project by the Affording Hope Project is The Carnival de Resistance- a travelling arts carnival, a village demonstration project, and a school for cultural transformation around the themes of environmental-economic justice, resistance, and radical theology.  The initial run of the Carnival will happen this coming fall and will take place in two locations - Harrisonburg VA - Sept. 13th - Sept. 22nd and Charlottesville VA - Sept 26th - Oct. 6th. In each location we will fill two weekends with experimental theater, live music, ceremony, street art and other forms of community celebration. The weekdays, in between, will focus on service projects, social engagement, education, skill sharing, craft and creative play.
A Mobile Carnival World:
        
Members of the Carnival Crew, a group of up to 30 will live, work, and travel together- collectively manifesting the vision of this project. Together, they will build the village, the outdoor Carnival venue and the Carnival midway. They will animate the Carnival midway, which teaches and entertains with roving performers, face-painters, story-tellers, a mask-making station, interactive installations, and clever twists on old Carnival games. The Carnival Crew will present four unique multimedia productions, each exploring one of the four elements (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water) and invite people to interact with these powerful symbols.
But most importantly, the members of the Carnival Crew will spread throughout the community to offer their unique gifts and support the programming of local organizations. According to the needs and interests of our local allies, we would like to paint murals and work on community gardens; offer workshops in bike repair, drumming, puppet-making, soap-making; help with stream clean-ups and political demonstrations, host story-telling circles for our elders and local food potlucks for all. To learn about the amazing people who have come on board as Organizers or as Carnival Crew, please visit our project website.

Demonstration Village:


A temporary village will be constructed to form the foundation for the events, modeling radical simplicity and sustainable alternatives.  We will consciously look at energy consumption in regard to transportation, food, waste management, footprint on the land and strain on the larger community.  This includes, but is not limited to:

Using repurposed material to build camp structures and production material (puppets, props, costumes, stage, set pieces, etc)
Cooking together (with food gleaned from local food sources) with solar ovens and rocket stoves, to diminish use of fossil fuels.
Travelling by bicycle and a veggie-oil bus.
Powering our event sound system with bicycle generators.
Practicing conflict transformation and transparency within the group.
Operating in the gift economy, with meals that are open to the public, no admission to the events, and freely shared resources and relationships
The Carnival will offer models of life-giving earth care practices that provide for practical needs within our communities.  At the same time, we are embodying a spirituality that is tied to the health of the Earth- a spirituality that has been fueling resistance work for generations. We hope to reinvigorate local leaders and rouse communities, inspiring those new to resistance work and encouraging those who have been holding the torch for some time. Visit the website, to learn more about our influences and the faith element of this project.
What We Need:
So far we have raised $20,900 out of our goal of $53,000, from grants and individual donations.  We are hoping to raise $18,000 on Indiegogo.  Your donations will go towards helping to build:

Items for our Community Kitchen & Village:  solar ovens, rocket stoves, solar showers, hand-washing stations, tent structures, etc. 
Items for our Performances: a bicycle -powered sound system, materials for mobile stages, costume materials, fire dancing equipment, props, carnival games, etc.
Items for our Social Engagement Events:  mural paint, art supplies for puppet-making, mask-making supplies and other skill shares.
Promotion Materials:  posters, fliers, website, etc.
Logistical Support:  tent and parade permits, insurance
Support for the Carnival Crew and Organizers (so that month long participation is possible)
Support for keeping ALL the events FREE, so that they are accessible to anyone in the world!

<p>In 1983, Dr. Mariam Raqib left Afghanistan as a child refugee for America. When she returned for the first time in 2003 she found her country devastated by war. The trees that she loved and had once played happily under had been wiped out.</p>
<p>Determined to make a difference she set out to replace the trees lost by war. For the past 4 years she has perfected the skills and established nurseries required to produce high quality saplings in increasingly large numbers. Now these skills and knowledge are ready to take a big investment and expand the project to other provinces of Afghanistan and a wide-scale reforesation effort.  This is The Afghan Tree Project. As the multi-national forces leave Afghanistan in 2014, this is a powerful and practical opportunity for everyone to help leave Afghanistan a better place.  To do this we need your help. </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We need the funds to expand our nurseries which are the engine of the reforestation effort. By expanding the numbers of saplings produced we can provide fruit trees to individual families providing shade and fruit for nourishment. We can replace more of the traditional <em>Deraa's </em>shaded meeting places and begin our work to reform areas of forest which have been depleted by war.  </p>
<p>In exchange we have made efforts to make our gift packages more generous than an average crowdfunding campaign. We've done this because we hope you'll come back and support us again one day and also because we'd like you to be champions of this work to others in your own community.  </p>
<p>Our award-winning designer Johnny Selman based at Google's Creative Lab in New York designed our gift products and they are really stunning. We've designed our gifts around the principles of community and sharing. We want you to have fun flying our kites together and sharing cups of tea in our beautiful chai cups! </p>
<p>In an age when we are all aware of our carbon footprint, even if we don't do much to manage it, a donation to the Afghan Tree Project provides a multi-impact carbon offset option. The trees not only reduce carbon but make a huge impact to the Afghan people, providing shade, nourishment and employment in a fragile economy.   If this is your motivation we've produced some carefully designed home and car window stickers which will let people know you care about carbon. </p>
<p>We guarantee that no tree is double counted and the number of trees that you donate towards are the minimum that are planted on your behalf. If we do better we'll let you know that too.  </p>
<p>At the higher levels we are producing hard back coffee table books and personalised products by Afghan craftsmen and women.  Everyone receives a wall certficiate and stickers for your fridge, wall or bike.  </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Our work has great potential for the well-being of the country and the people.  We receive requests regularly from other communities in the neighboring provinces who know about our work and wish to collaborate with us.  </p>
<p> The need is great, and yet our current funding situation does not permit us to explore options for growth.  We have spent years developing a successful working model for developing our projects, and these projects  are easily replicated elsewhere in the country.  We will use the funds from this campaign to develop and expand our projects.  We will do this in the following manner:</p>
<p>Plant larger quantities of seeds so that these seeds will then germinate and yield in greater number of tree saplings. The surplus saplings will be shared with communities in neighboring provinces.</p>
<p>The tree planting will mean the employment of additional nursery workers providing work, contributing to the economy and forming a workforce skilled in nurturing trees for the future. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>The best way you can help us other than by a donation is to spread the word of the Afghan Tree Project through word of mouth and social media. Please like us on our facebook page <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/AfghanTree"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/AfghanTree</a> where you'll find all the latest gift information, news and pictures.

Why not hold a kite flying event or other fundraiser at your school or community centre? We'll do everything we can to help you with raffle prizes from our list of gifts and promotional material as well as giving you a big mention on our facebook page and twitter.  </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Story</h2>
<p>We (Kieran, Liam and Thibaut) are living in Bermuda, and we are enjoying our surroundings in our daily teenage lives. Even if we are appreciating our lives, we feel that an environment with less plastic will be better.</p>
<p>As a group, we want to make a change. After many hours of research about plastic pollution, contacting different environmental organizations and hard work, we finally decided our objective for our school project. We want to raise funds to have a third Seabin for Bermuda to fight the proliferation of plastic in the oceans.</p>
<p>A Seabin is a floating bin that collects trash from the water. Every hour, it pumps 25 liters of water into the catch bag. Afterwards, the water is pumped back into the ocean, leaving debris, litter, oil and other pollutants behind. We think that this can reduce the amount of plastic in the ocean.</p>
<p>We are organizing many fundraisers in and outside of our school to collect as much funding as possible for the additional Seabin. The challenging aspect is that one Seabin costs approximately $4000. We will be very happy if we are able to collect all of the funds necessary to purchase a singular Seabin, because we will feel that our Somersfield Academy M3 Community Project will have been a success. </p>

<p>Indigenous activism in Guatemala is under threat. Unfortunately, government remilitarization of those indigenous communities hardest hit during the 36 years of violence and genocide has steadily increased in the past four years. The repressive government’s presence poses huge barriers to indigenous civil and environmental activism. The Network In Solidarity with the People of Guatemala has been working since 1981 to make civic engagement possible for these indigenous activists. I will be stationed mainly in the Ixcán region of Guatemala for one year to monitor and report on crucial organizing of indigenous communities around environmental and civil rights. You can read more about the specific accompaniment projects of 2013 below. Will you join me in solidarity? You would be surprised how much your donation can make a difference.

<p>I moved to Berkeley, California after four years of immigrant organizing in Salem, Oregon. What I found upon arrival in Berkeley was surprising. On the sidewalks of a street not far from my house in Berkeley you will find approximately 85 Guatemalans lining the sidewalks and looking for work. After talking to them more, I found that many of my neighbors had left Guatemala for political and environmental reasons.</p>
<p> My Guatemalan neighbors in Berkeley are not the only ones. Many rural indigenous Guatemalans are displaced from their home country due to the construction of large development projects and political violence. What is more, as long as those responsible for Guatemala’s 36 years of civil war and genocide still hold power, indigenous activists so adamantly committed to environmental preservation and justice will be denied their right to political participation.</p>
<p>Until civic participation becomes a real possibility for activists in Guatemala, there will be a need for human rights observers. I have decided to commit a year of my life to solidarity with these activists. As an accompanier I will present a physical presence of international solidarity to dissuade government violence. In addition, my work will amplify indigenous voices via an e-newsletter and news articles. </p>
<p>NISGUA’s accompaniment projects have a record of success. Our Guatemalan partners report an increase in their power to organize as a result of physical international presence in indigenous activist spaces. The president of the Association for Justice and Reconciliation, one of the indigenous-led organizations we accompany once said,</p>
<p>""International accompaniment in Guatemala is a crucial foundation which makes the Guatemalan State recognize not only the participation of the people of Guatemala, but also that the international community supports the process and pursuit of justice in Guatemala""</p>

<p>Mining and Death Threats</p>
<p>Guatemalan activists are at the forefront of the mining reform movement. San Jose del Golfo and San Pedro Ayampuc are communities protesting Tambor mine owned by EXMIGUA, the Guatemalan subsidiary of the US Company, Kappes, Cassiday &amp; Associates. The protest is one of a series in Guatemala’s indigenous communities pressuring the government to conduct ethical environmental impact reports. The standoff at the mine entrance is also a move to enforce their right as indigenous people to consultation prior to government intrusion. The case of mining truly demonstrates the need for accompaniment as grassroots media personnel and community-based organizations are bombarded with death threats. Activists rely on accompaniers to be present at their now yearlong protest in order to report on the criminal activity of mine employees.  Read more at <a href=""http://nisgua.blogspot.com/2013/03/la-puya-encampment-celebrates-first.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://nisgua.blogspot.com/2013/03/la-puya-encampment-celebrates-first.html</a> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Ixcán</span></em></p>
<p>The upper third of the El Quiché department at the border of Mexico is known as the Ixcán region. The residents of jungle lowlands of Ixcán are largely Mayans who were dispossessed of their ancestral lands. The Ixcán communities became so successful that political and military leaders saw them as a threat and marked them as communist rebels during the civil war. Mayans and non-violent activsts in the Ixcán region were among the most persecuted and suffered heavily from the scorched earth massacres in the early 1980s. Those who escaped the fires in the Ixcán fled to Mexico.</p>

<p align=""center"">Accompaniment Works</p>
<p>As NISGUA accompaniers, we are adamant about the need for allies willing to allow Guatemalan activists to be the voice of their own movement. The founders of NISGUA realized during re-settlement in 1981 that international accompaniment of genocide survivors sizably reduces government-enforced violence. NISGUA volunteers only accompany grassroots organizers who ask for monitoring services. Where NISGUA accompaniers do not work directly is in regions with heavy narco-trafficking as accompaniment dissuasion tactics are less effective.</p>
<p>My commitment to justice in Guatemalan doesn’t stop after my year in Guatemala ends. I will continue to take direct action solidarity upon my return to the United States. Starting in July 2014 I will be engaging United States politicians in the need for solidarity with Guatemalan civil and environmental activists.</p>

<p align=""center"">About NISGUA</p>
<p>The Network in Solidarity with the People of Guatemala (NISGUA) is an established organization with experience. Founded in 1981, NISGUA only accompanies activists who request accompaniment. Most importantly, the organization is fiercely committed to allowing Guatemalan activists to be the voice of their own movement. When you invest in me as a NISGUA volunteer, you know you investing your money into a project designed and led by the Guatemalan people.</p>
<p>I will be one of 5 NISGUA accompaniers. NISGUA is a founding member of an international network of international Guatemalan accompaniers called ACOGUATE. In teams of two, we will be working in four areas: Ixcán, Ixil, Rabinal and Guatemala City. Depending on the changing needs of Guatemalan activists, I will be stationed in one or more of these regions. I will be spending most of my time in the Ixcán region. Every six weeks I will report back to the capitol to report back to NISGUA. If I am moved to the capitol, I will be responsible for observing peaceful protests and accompanying witnesses in the genocide trials.</p>

Indigenous activism in Guatemala is under threat. Unfortunately, government remilitarization of those indigenous communities hardest hit during the 36 years of violence and genocide has steadily increased in the past four years. The repressive government’s presence poses huge barriers to indigenous civil and environmental activism. The Network In Solidarity with the People of Guatemala has been working since 1981 to make civic engagement possible for these indigenous activists. I will be stationed mainly in the Ixcán region of Guatemala for one year to monitor and report on crucial organizing of indigenous communities around environmental and civil rights. You can read more about the specific accompaniment projects of 2013 below. Will you join me in solidarity? You would be surprised how much your donation can make a difference. My sponsoring community in the United States has already raised $4,380 for the project. I just need  $2,955 more!

<p>Meadowview Biological Research Station is a world-renowned research station with a mission of preserving and restoring rare pitcher plant habitats, and associated ecosystems, in Maryland and Virginia. The organization was founded in 1995 and has attracted local, regional, national, and international support for its efforts. Meadowview is a grass-roots environmental organization that has developed and sustained itself largely through the development of a unique business model: a conservation organization supported by sales of ornamental pitcher plant cultivars and novel native wetland plants with a supporting membership base. This business model has been successful in funding the organization to date but efforts are now underway to develop an endowment to support operations in the future. Meadowview also has a fifteen-year history of working with local elementary, middle, high school and college students. </p><p>Our mission is accomplished through a unique five-step process of discovery, propagation, research, reintroduction, and education. Long-range goals are being met through the development of a preserve system for Virginia’s endangered longleaf pine/ pitcher plant ecosystem. Two preserves have been developed in Virginia: the Central Virginia Preserve in Caroline County and the Joseph Pines Preserve in Sussex County. The Central VA Preserve is protecting the northern-most pitcher plant bog in Virginia with state threatened species while the Joseph Pines Preserve is re-assembling the indigenous biodiversity of the endangered Virginia longleaf pine/pitcher plant ecosystem.

Meadowview Biological Research Station is a world-renowned research station with a mission of preserving and restoring rare pitcher plant habitats, and associated ecosystems, in Maryland and Virginia. The organization was founded in 1995 and has attracted local, regional, national, and international support for its efforts. Meadowview is a grass-roots environmental organization that has developed and sustained itself largely through the development of a unique business model: a conservation organization supported by sales of ornamental pitcher plant cultivars and novel native wetland plants with a supporting membership base. This business model has been successful in funding the organization to date but efforts are now underway to develop an endowment to support operations in the future. Meadowview also has a fifteen-year history of working with local elementary, middle, high school and college students. Our mission is accomplished through a unique five-step process of discovery, propagation, research, reintroduction, and education. Long-range goals are being met through the development of a preserve system for Virginia’s endangered longleaf pine/ pitcher plant ecosystem. Two preserves have been developed in Virginia: the Central Virginia Preserve in Caroline County and the Joseph Pines Preserve in Sussex County. The Central VA Preserve is protecting the northern-most pitcher plant bog in Virginia with state threatened species while the Joseph Pines Preserve is re-assembling the indigenous biodiversity of the endangered Virginia longleaf pine/pitcher plant ecosystem. Support for these land conservation efforts has been obtained from the Virginia Dept. of Environmental Quality, Virginia Dept. of Forestry, Virginia Land Conservation Foundation, Community Foundation of the Rappahannock River Region, Mary Morton Parsons Foundation, International Carnivorous Plant Society, and worldwide members of the organization.What We Need & What You Get
What we Need: The Mary Morton Parsons Foundation awarded Meadowview a $50,000 challenge grant in November 2013 for the purchase of the education and biodiversity center at Joseph Pines Preserve. We must raise a match of $50,000 by November 2014 to receive the grant. This money will be the down payment on the biodiversity center. This grant success was followed by the Virginia Dept. of Environmental Quality (DEQ) approving our loan request of $449,000 for the project. We received the second highest score in the Virginia for the project from DEQ, just below Natural Bridge. The loan is contingent on acquiring donor or foundation support for the note. Donations exceeding the needed Mary Morton Parsons grant match will be applied to secure and then pay the DEQ loan. The project is outlined in our 2013 newsletter and as a detailed pdf prospectus on our Joseph Pines link (both available on www.pitcherplant.org).

Re-Store.ph is the site where users can post their unwanted equipment, furniture and other usable items. Other users can search for the items and offer to take them off the owner's hands for free.</span><br/></p><p></p><p>It aims to build a nationwide gifting movement by matching unwanted goods with individuals who can still use them.</p><p>The point is to create a community that exchanges objects that would have otherwise ended in the landfill or worse, in rivers, streets or drainage. It makes recycling and reusing as simple as one, two, click while at the same time helping individuals and businesses save money they would've spent on new items or properly disposing of their old items.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We believe that the Re-Store Project can lessen the overwhelming amount of trash Philippine cities spew out. Metro Manila alone produces 8,700 tons of garbage every day. Of this, 40% doesn't even have to be thrown away. Around 35% of generated garbage can be recycled while 5% can be reused.</p><p><u><b>The project is in the prototype development stage now.</b></u> We already have started to develop the web platform: <a href=""http://www.re-store.ph"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.re-store.ph</a>  but team put on hold the development because of some conflict with work and other commitments. We plan to hire or look for web developers/partners who can complete the web platform. </p><p>The idea is very promising and we hope not to delay its development that is why we are sourcing for funds to make this happen. </p><p>In order to realize this we hope to raise <b><u>$ 3,500 USD for web development. </u></b>Once we have it live, we will build the community and look for VCs to support the movement and upcycling.</p><p>In return for funding and supporting this project, we offer you the following perks (see below).</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p><p>The project aims to build a nationwide gifting movement by matching
unwanted goods with individuals who can use them and to create
eco-opportunities. Not only does the environment benefit from this system, it
will also save businesses and individuals thousands of pesos in waste disposal
and procurement costs while forging closer ties among local community.</p>
<p>Its first goal is to raise awareness within the community. The startup
aims to have around 10,000 users by the first quarter of 2014. Once it
reaches that stage, it will shift to the next phase of development, which will
help them generate revenue. That’s when the team will implement an e-commerce
aspect to the site. It aims to create new products from recyclable materials
that it will sell on the platform and on an upcoming physical store. It will
also encourage other eco-friendly stores to use the platform to sell their
products.</p><p></p><p>All the services on the site are free. Members of the Re-Store community can build up ""green points"" every time they make an exchange.

It is an online platform where individuals, groups and businesses exchange unwanted items as a way to reuse and recycle. Re-Store.ph is the site where users can post their unwanted equipment, furniture and other usable items. Other users can search for the items and offer to take them off the owner's hands for free.It aims to build a nationwide gifting movement by matching unwanted goods with individuals who can still use them.The point is to create a community that exchanges objects that would have otherwise ended in the landfill or worse, in rivers, streets or drainage. It makes recycling and reusing as simple as one, two, click while at the same time helping individuals and businesses save money they would've spent on new items or properly disposing of their old items.What We Need & What You GetWe believe that the Re-Store Project can lessen the overwhelming amount of trash Philippine cities spew out. Metro Manila alone produces 8,700 tons of garbage every day. Of this, 40% doesn't even have to be thrown away. Around 35% of generated garbage can be recycled while 5% can be reused.The project is in the prototype development stage now. We already have started to develop the web platform: www.re-store.ph  but team put on hold the development because of some conflict with work and other commitments. We plan to hire or look for web developers/partners who can complete the web platform. The idea is very promising and we hope not to delay its development that is why we are sourcing for funds to make this happen. In order to realize this we hope to raise $ 3,500 USD for web development. Once we have it live, we will build the community and look for VCs to support the movement and upcycling.In return for funding and supporting this project, we offer you the following perks (see below).The ImpactThe project aims to build a nationwide gifting movement by matching
unwanted goods with individuals who can use them and to create
eco-opportunities. Not only does the environment benefit from this system, it
will also save businesses and individuals thousands of pesos in waste disposal
and procurement costs while forging closer ties among local community.
Its first goal is to raise awareness within the community. The startup
aims to have around 10,000 users by the first quarter of 2014. Once it
reaches that stage, it will shift to the next phase of development, which will
help them generate revenue. That’s when the team will implement an e-commerce
aspect to the site. It aims to create new products from recyclable materials
that it will sell on the platform and on an upcoming physical store. It will
also encourage other eco-friendly stores to use the platform to sell their
products.All the services on the site are free. Members of the Re-Store community can build up ""green points"" every time they make an exchange. These points can be used to avail of rewards or discounts on products of member businesses and companies.With enough exchanges, the Re-Store community can lessen the overwhelming amount of trash Philippine cities spew out. Metro Manila alone produces 8,700 tons of garbage every day. Of this, 40% doesn't even have to be thrown away. Around 35% of generated garbage can be recycled while 5% can be reused.Advocacy with functionalityBusinesses can use the Re-Store Project not only as a way to acquire needed equipment or resources, but as a way to build up their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).The site will highlight the business’ green credentials so that members with green advocacies can make informed purchasing or procurement decisions.Different communities can also come together on Re-Store. Members in the same town, company or building can let their colleagues know their old stuff are up for grabs on the site. Their physical proximity to each other makes checking the item's condition and claiming the item much easier and more convenient.The bottomline for what will make Re-Store tick is streamlining. If successful, it can streamline not only how one person's unwanted resources meet another person's needs, but how Philippine communities manage their trash and treasure.Best of all, it may just be the point where advocacy meets functionality, where helping the environment is not only laudable but also practical. Other Ways You Can HelpWe are currently looking for people who can work /partner with us for this movement/start-up.

My mission is to stop global chemical and biotech corporations from poisoning the land and people of Hawaii, and I need your support for the 2014 Hawaii state lawmaking session.</li></ul><ul><li>Babes Against Biotech (BAB) is a policy oriented, progressive, community advocacy organization that promotes organic living and grassroots democratic action to protect Hawaii from GMOs and related pesticides. We educate our peers on the environmental and health risks of GMOs and pesticides, advocate for voter registration, communicate with legislators, testify in government hearings, act as a community watchdog organization, analyze legislator campaign funding, protect our environment from chemical pollution and create pathways for Hawaii's long term sustainability, governing and local food production. </li></ul><ul><li>
<b>Hawaii is GMO Ground Zero worldwide.</b> We are the home to over 5,000 open-air Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) experiments, exposing residents to massive restricted pesticide use, environmental contamination and genetic experimentation. We desperately need policy change to protect ourselves from GMO agrochemical intensive agriculture and Genetically Engineered (GE) seed production by the largest chemical companies in the world, occurring year round. The GE seeds developed in Hawaii are exported, genetically contaminating food crops worldwide, being engineered for experimental herbicide resistance and producing pesticides. Our air, land, water and health is being heavily genetically and chemically contaminated and we are considered the endangered species capital of the world.</li></ul><ul><li>The legislative session will release hundreds of bills and each bill has 2-8+ hearings and full votes before the House and Senate. Last year I was in the Capitol almost every weekday testifying and reporting, working overnight, marched through rainstorms across the state of Hawaii and have camped numerous times overnight in lines to testify for hearings when necessary. Everywhere there is a GMO lobbyist or interest at stake, I want to be there, defending and progressing community demands for safe, non-toxic environments.</li></ul><p> <b>Funding for Legislative Session Expenses</b> <br/></p><p>The $15,000 goal will cover all salary and organizational expenses for full-time support during the 2014 statewide Legislative Session from January through May 2014. During this time I will be focused on:</p><ul><li>Delivering our powerful, statistic-based in-person testimony at all hearings state-wide related to pesticides and GMOs, including the upcoming Maui County legislation for pesticide and GMO disclosure, buffer zones and impact studies<br/>
</li></ul><ul><li>Tracking, reporting on, and promoting all related legislative topics and proceedings for public knowledge and awareness</li></ul><ul><li>Organizing local communities to take constitutional and democratic actions that support positive legislation and prevent the government from stripping the people’s rights to a clean environment, health and choice</li></ul><ul><li>Building global awareness of Hawaii’s GMO and pesticide issues by continually growing our 22,500 subscribers, 13,000 members, and over 22,000 social media followers with a weekly reach of over 700,000 on Facebook alone</li></ul><ul><li>Growing outreach and educational event participation, with a focus on expanding our presence on Oahu and Maui</li></ul><ul><li>Completing a comprehensive Hawaii Voting Guide based on all elected officials’ voting records, campaign finance records and legislator surveys to drive votes to quality candidates and to reject candidates who do the chemical industry's bidding and fail to protect us – putting immense pressure on our public officials to act in the best interests of their people</li></ul><ul><li>I am up against a multibillion-dollar global industry with full staffs and millionaire lobbyists that have directed over $515,000 to our elected officials with all the chemical company funding they need to launch massive PR campaigns.

I have done this without any salary and now I am requesting back up. Some highlights of my past work include:<br/></p><p><b>Policy History:</b> I have delivered strong testimony on every measure, assisted in directing policy and attended almost every hearing on GMOs and pesticides in the Hawaiian islands since January of 2012. In 2013, I was in the Hawaii Capitol almost every day of session testifying for pesticide regulation, GMO labeling, the right to regulate GMOs and pesticide abuse, pesticide disclosure and public notification, the right for Counties to protect citizen life and health, school edible gardens and locally grown, non-toxic food for our kids and community members. Last year we saw the most progress on this issue in Hawaii ever. Together, we:</p><ul>
<li>Nearly passed GMO labeling for the State of Hawaii</li>
<li>Defeated SB727, the chemical industry’s attempt to remove County rights to protect life and health</li>
<li>Defeated SB590, their attempt to legally shield themselves from pesticide drift and genetic contamination nuisance lawsuits</li>
<li>Passed HB-673, making progress in our pesticide disclosure policy with more public pressure than ever before</li>
<li>Enacted Senate Rule 23, to force a GMO labeling hearing in the Senate after I gathered other groups and Senator signatures</li>
<li>Blocked Monsanto from diverting 2.6 million gallons of water per day in Honolulu through the Water Commission</li>
<li>Passed Resolution 12-57 for GMO labeling in the City &amp; County of Honolulu alongside now Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and Councilman Tom Berg</li>
<li>Passed GMO labeling measures in Maui, Kauai and Hawaii Counties for the 2012 Hawaii State Association of Counties legislative package</li>
<li>Passed Kauai County Bill 2491 for GMO and pesticide disclosure, spraying buffer zones and impact studies</li>
<li>Passed Hawaii Island Bill 113 for GMO prohibition</li>
</ul><p><b>First Amendment Protections:</b> I have been highly involved in, organized, supported, and promoted various community collaboration efforts across the Hawaiian islands, including:</p><ul>
<li>Education at over three dozen outreach events across Hawaii in 2013</li>
<li>2012 March on Monsanto, March on Monsanto II, and March on Syngenta, alongside James W. Macey and Hawaiian sovereignty leader Uncle Walter Ritte</li>
<li>2012 GMO Free Oahu’s Aina Fest</li>
<li>2013 We the People Rally &amp; Heleku March on Hawaii Capitol Legislative Opening Day, under Uncle Walter Ritte's leadership with Dr. Vandana Shiva</li>

I was a child theater actress and professional dancer in my teens and am a graduate of LACHSA. 
As an adult, I shifted my focus from the entertainment industry towards 
gait analysis and muscular sports therapy with a focus on improving 
athletic performance, completing an internship with a chiropractic upper
 cervical specialist. After leaving the sales Director position to free 
more time for Hawaiian
 cultural studies, I worked for combined years in recruiting rare 
technical talent for venture capitalist funded start-ups,
training, natural food distribution and Community Supported Agriculture.

history professor who engaged in international relations and founded several 
global alliances which negotiated for peace in war zones. I traveled to 16 countries with my parents and observed diplomacy between dozens of countries as a kid but they were extremely busy so we had an unconventional democratic method of governing the household. We had a constitution and statutes which were formed through annual mock legislative sessions around the kitchen table.

We are the home to over 5,000 open-air Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) experiments, exposing residents to massive restricted pesticide use, environmental contamination and genetic experimentation. We desperately need policy change to protect ourselves from GMO agrochemical intensive agriculture and Genetically Engineered (GE) seed production by the largest chemical companies in the world, occurring year round. The GE seeds developed in Hawaii are exported, genetically contaminating food crops worldwide, being engineered for experimental herbicide resistance and producing pesticides. Our air, land, water and health is being heavily genetically and chemically contaminated and we are considered the endangered species capital of the world.The legislative session will release hundreds of bills and each bill has 2-8+ hearings and full votes before the House and Senate. Last year I was in the Capitol almost every weekday testifying and reporting, working overnight, marched through rainstorms across the state of Hawaii and have camped numerous times overnight in lines to testify for hearings when necessary. Everywhere there is a GMO lobbyist or interest at stake, I want to be there, defending and progressing community demands for safe, non-toxic environments. Funding for Legislative Session Expenses The $15,000 goal will cover all salary and organizational expenses for full-time support during the 2014 statewide Legislative Session from January through May 2014. During this time I will be focused on:Delivering our powerful, statistic-based in-person testimony at all hearings state-wide related to pesticides and GMOs, including the upcoming Maui County legislation for pesticide and GMO disclosure, buffer zones and impact studies
Tracking, reporting on, and promoting all related legislative topics and proceedings for public knowledge and awarenessOrganizing local communities to take constitutional and democratic actions that support positive legislation and prevent the government from stripping the people’s rights to a clean environment, health and choiceBuilding global awareness of Hawaii’s GMO and pesticide issues by continually growing our 22,500 subscribers, 13,000 members, and over 22,000 social media followers with a weekly reach of over 700,000 on Facebook aloneGrowing outreach and educational event participation, with a focus on expanding our presence on Oahu and MauiCompleting a comprehensive Hawaii Voting Guide based on all elected officials’ voting records, campaign finance records and legislator surveys to drive votes to quality candidates and to reject candidates who do the chemical industry's bidding and fail to protect us – putting immense pressure on our public officials to act in the best interests of their peopleI am up against a multibillion-dollar global industry with full staffs and millionaire lobbyists that have directed over $515,000 to our elected officials with all the chemical company funding they need to launch massive PR campaigns. I have to budget for everything and have grown our organization tremendously on a very tight budget, and will continue to make strategic use of every dollar.Our ImpactIn the past two years, with no salary funding, I’ve become known as one of the GMO/chemical industries' most public opponents in Hawaii, which is GMO Ground Zero worldwide. I am nearly everywhere they appear regarding policy, opposing their consistent perpetuation of misinformation about the risks of their products, and drawing attention to the amount of money they have given our elected officials and their undue influence. I have done this without any salary and now I am requesting back up. Some highlights of my past work include:Policy History: I have delivered strong testimony on every measure, assisted in directing policy and attended almost every hearing on GMOs and pesticides in the Hawaiian islands since January of 2012. In 2013, I was in the Hawaii Capitol almost every day of session testifying for pesticide regulation, GMO labeling, the right to regulate GMOs and pesticide abuse, pesticide disclosure and public notification, the right for Counties to protect citizen life and health, school edible gardens and locally grown, non-toxic food for our kids and community members. Last year we saw the most progress on this issue in Hawaii ever. Together, we:
Nearly passed GMO labeling for the State of Hawaii
Defeated SB727, the chemical industry’s attempt to remove County rights to protect life and health
Defeated SB590, their attempt to legally shield themselves from pesticide drift and genetic contamination nuisance lawsuits
Passed HB-673, making progress in our pesticide disclosure policy with more public pressure than ever before
Enacted Senate Rule 23, to force a GMO labeling hearing in the Senate after I gathered other groups and Senator signatures
Blocked Monsanto from diverting 2.6 million gallons of water per day in Honolulu through the Water Commission
Passed Resolution 12-57 for GMO labeling in the City & County of Honolulu alongside now Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and Councilman Tom Berg
Passed GMO labeling measures in Maui, Kauai and Hawaii Counties for the 2012 Hawaii State Association of Counties legislative package
Passed Kauai County Bill 2491 for GMO and pesticide disclosure, spraying buffer zones and impact studies
Passed Hawaii Island Bill 113 for GMO prohibition
First Amendment Protections: I have been highly involved in, organized, supported, and promoted various community collaboration efforts across the Hawaiian islands, including:
Education at over three dozen outreach events across Hawaii in 2013
2012 March on Monsanto, March on Monsanto II, and March on Syngenta, alongside James W. Macey and Hawaiian sovereignty leader Uncle Walter Ritte
2012 GMO Free Oahu’s Aina Fest
2013 We the People Rally & Heleku March on Hawaii Capitol Legislative Opening Day, under Uncle Walter Ritte's leadership with Dr. Vandana Shiva
2013 Holomua for the Right to Know at the Capitol for GMO labeling

2013 Marches in March; a session of marches on all islands, with Hawaii GMO Justice Coalition and pro-surfer Dustin Barca with over 6,000 participants statewide

2013 Waikiki March Against Monsanto, with the support of over 2,500 people and dozens of our non-profit and supporting groups
2013 Mana March on Kaua`i for Bill 2491 with Ohana O Kauai and Hawaii SEED with over 4,000 in attendance
2013 Haleiwa Aloha Aina March of over a thousand people, with Ohana O Kauai, Dustin Barca, and numerous world famous surfers despite the storm and rain
In 2013, over 17,000 Hawaii residents in total have marched to remove these hazardous companies from Hawaii with our organization, support and/or promotion
Media Appearances: Featured in Business Week, The Huffington Post, The New York Times, Associated Press, Hawaii News Now, KITV, KGMB, KHON, Fox News Radio, Sustainable Pulse, The Garden Island, Civil Beat, Honolulu Weekly, Honolulu Star-Advertiser, The West Australian, Canberra News, David Cain Has Issues, The Seed Story, Hawaii Tribune Herald, For Ewa Today, The Rick Hamada Show, Health Talk Hawaii, Hawaii's Tomorrow, Soap Box Live, Songs of Sovereignty, 102.7 Da Bomb, Star 101, Hawaii Public Radio and numerous other publications and community shows. Inducted into the Hall of Fame by the Every Day Hero Project in 2013. Background: I have had tens of thousands of dollars of leadership development and public speaking training and am the former United States Director of Sales for an electrophysiology technology company with products based on Nobel prize winning research and created by the co-inventor of the Pacemaker. I was mentored by my international CEO, the former Director of  Estée Lauder and a highly decorated Counterintelligence Instructor in the United States Army. I was a child theater actress and professional dancer in my teens and am a graduate of LACHSA. 
As an adult, I shifted my focus from the entertainment industry towards 
gait analysis and muscular sports therapy with a focus on improving 
athletic performance, completing an internship with a chiropractic upper
 cervical specialist. After leaving the sales Director position to free 
more time for Hawaiian
 cultural studies, I worked for combined years in recruiting rare 
technical talent for venture capitalist funded start-ups,
training, natural food distribution and Community Supported Agriculture.
 In addition, I held a Director position for a sustainability based 
curriculum pilot project in West Oahu and I am the former Executive 
Secretary for the Honolulu City Council, District One, Waianae Coast. I was raised in an internationally politically active family, I have to give credit. My Father was an anti-Batista rebel leader in Cuba turned USC graduated 
history professor who engaged in international relations and founded several 
global alliances which negotiated for peace in war zones. I traveled to 16 countries with my parents and observed diplomacy between dozens of countries as a kid but they were extremely busy so we had an unconventional democratic method of governing the household. We had a constitution and statutes which were formed through annual mock legislative sessions around the kitchen table. Everything was approved through negotiation and contractual agreements I had to write, even my ballet lessons. These days, we laugh about how ridiculously serious it was for kids and my Mom just says, ""Yeah, but, look at you now!"" Other Ways You Can HelpI completely understand if you cannot give financially right now and there are many other ways you can help me accomplish these goals:Share this site with your friends who care about the environment, pesticide abuse and the risks of unregulated genetic engineering and ask them to support. What happens in Hawaii affects the entire world since the bulk of GMO testing and GMO seed industry is occurring here.Volunteer for BAB or collaborate! We need everyone's support on this issue, no matter how small. You can reach me at nomi@babesagainstbiotech.org.Mahalo!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The future of the marine hobby is in aquaculture and Biota Aquariums is proud to offer the first-ever commercially available aquarium that includes only cultured animals.</p><p><strong>Where do the fish come from?</strong></p><p>Our two clownfish come from an aquaculture farm in Florida, USA, and the Rainford's Goby comes from our Biota Marine Life Nursery in Palau. We carefully acclimate the fish at our marine life center in Florida with the aim that you receive healthy, disease-free fish.</p><p><strong>Can you ship Biota internationally?</strong></p><p>Due to International Agriculture Laws we are only able to ship Biota and our living organisms to the contiguous US (48 contiguous states &amp; Washington DC only).</p><p><strong>Why did you pick Clownfish and Goby?</strong></p><p>Clownfish and Gobies were chosen because they are captive-raised, beautiful, hardy and they get along great together. They also can live their complete life span in the Biota Aquarium since they do not grow larger than 3"".</p><p><strong>What is live rock?</strong></p><p>Live rock is a calcium-based rock that provides both important habitat for your fish as well as bacteria that aid in maintaining your water quality. It is carefully conditioned in seawater for 4-6 months before being shipped. The live rock included with your Biota Aquarium is man-made in California.</p><p><b>How many corals can I have to my tank?</b></p><p>To ensure a responsibility sustained aquarium, we are limiting each Biota Aquarium order to a maximum of 4 corals. Biota Aquariums offers several hardy soft corals that are appropriate for the tank. These were chosen because of their ease of care, lighting and water flow requirements. </p><p><strong>How long do Clownfish/Goby live for?</strong></p><p>Since your fish are captive-raised, their birthdates are known! Clownfish have been documented to reach 30 years or more in captivity. Rainford Gobies have only recently been cultured are believed to live 6 or more years with the proper diet.</p><p><strong>How do you ship the items to me?</strong></p><p>Biota Aquariums uses courier company FedEx for all US shipments that include tracking numbers. The fish and coral are shipped overnight ensuring safe and healthy wildlife. Please see our section entitled ""What's Included"" for more details about what si included in each of our 3 shipments. </p><p><strong>What is Biota's 15 Day Guarantee?</strong></p><p>Biota Aquariums is committed to providing the highest quality, sustainably cultured animals that have been thoroughly conditioned for their upcoming journey to you.If for any reason our step by step setup instructions and acclimation guide is not successful in the first 15 days, Biota will replace the wildlife and will work with each customer to ensure a healthy re-introduction of the fish and coral. </p><p><strong>How much do I feed my fish?</strong></p><p>One of the most important factors in maintaining your new aquatic habitat successfully is following the feeding instructions. DO NOT OVER FEED! The Biota Aquarium comes with a food packet and a measuring spoon. The fish should get one spoonful 2X per day. The best time to feed is after the light has been on for at least 30 minutes and again before the light goes out. Feeding should be at least 4 hours apart. Your fish ""sleep"" too and eat best during the times when the light is on.</p><p><strong>Can I add more fish, live rock, or corals to the tank?</strong><br/>The Biota Aquarium has been specifically designed to house the 3 fish, live rock and a maximum of 4 Biota sourced corals. It is highly recommended that you enjoy your ecosystem and that you DO NOT introduce any other fish to the aquarium as this could comprise the health of your tank and cause biological instability. Once outside fish or corals are introduced to your tank, Biota cannot guarantee the success or livelihood of the ecosystem. </p><p><strong>Can I add plants to the tank?</strong><br/>The Biota Aquarium is a marine ecosystem that will not support freshwater plants. We recommend that you do not add anything to the tank other than the animals, live rock and optional corals offered by us.</p><p><strong>What happens if I am going out of town?</strong></p><p>Your fish need to be fed daily so proper arrangements should be made to have someone monitor the tank and feed the fish in your absence. There are also fish feeders you can purchase that can feed your fish while you're away.</p><p><strong>What is the wattage of Biota's LED light? </strong></p><p>Biota's LED light is a 16-watt output, 1383 lumens. </p><p><strong>What type of pump does Biota use? </strong></p><p>Biota uses a submersible pump with a flow rate of 500 gallons per hour (GPH). </p><p><strong>What does the carbon filter and Biomax Media do for the tank?</strong></p><p>Biota's carbon filter removes organics and tannins that make the water yellow. It ultimately maintains crystal clear water. Biomax Media serves as a biological filter to keep water safe by removing ammonia and nitrite created from fish waste. </p><p><strong>Do backers need replacement filters? </strong></p><p>Yes. Biota's carbon filters should be replaced monthly and the Biomax Media and Foam Cartridge needs to be changed annually. A 6 month supply of these supplies can be purchased through our ""6 month of Supplies"" on Indiegogo or individual replacement items can be purchased through our website after the campaign. </p><p><strong>Why do I need a hydrometer?</strong></p><p>Here's a few reasons you need a hydrometer: </p><p>1. To measure the salinity or specific gravity of the water. </p><p>2. To make weekly replacement seawater </p><p>3. To monitor the aquarium water </p><p>Sometimes water in the aquarium slowly evaporates leaving salt behind, gradually increasing the salinity of the aquarium. You'll need to use the hydrometer to monitor this activity so that filtered freshwater can be added to keep salinity constant. Please note salinity should be kept constant at 26 parts per thousand (PPT), 1.019 Specific Gravity for fish only, or 32 PPT/1.023 for fish and corals.</p><p><strong>Why do I need a thermometer? Is there an ideal temperature the tank should stay at? </strong></p><p>Because the fish corals come from tropical regions where coral reefs are found, water should ideally be maintained between 74-78 degrees Fahrenheit to maintain healthy, happy marine life. This is vital to the health and longevity of marine life. </p><p><strong>What is the </strong><strong>Bio Starter</strong><strong>? </strong></p><p>The Bio Starter adds beneficial bacteria to the aquarium during the start-up process and the first month of 'cycling.' This helps establish necessary biological filtering bacteria to maintain proper water quality. </p><p><strong>What type of fish food comes with my Biota Aquarium and where can I buy more when I run out? </strong></p><p>The fish food we provide is sustainably sourced mysis shrimp pellet food. You will be provided with 60 days of fish food in your starter kit. When you run out, you can simply purchase more fish food from our website or by purchasing the ""6 Months Supply"" Perk on this IGG campaign. </p><p><strong>What color is the live sand substrate, how much is included, how long will it last, and where can I buy replacements?</strong></p><p>The live sand substrate is white coral sand and 6.6 pounds will be included in your starter package. Luckily it lasts years and there I no need to replace it. </p><p><strong>How much aquarium sea salt is included, how long will this last, and where can I buy replacements?</strong></p><p>Biota comes with two packs of aquarium salt, which provides enough salt to set up your Biota aquarium at the proper salinity. You will need more aquarium salt one week after set up, as you need to change the water of your Biota weekly. You can also buy extra salt from here on the Indiegogo page or your local fish store. We also have a pre-mixed seawater perk that delivers 5 gallons of seawater directly to your door. This makes it so you don't have to mix your own seawater! </p><p><strong>Do the fish have to be removed in order to clean the tank?</strong><br/>No. You can safely clean the glass, pump sponge and filter area without removing any animals. For water exchanges, the water can be carefully siphoned out with a small hose into a bucket. Use care not to siphon up your fish or corals!</p><p><strong>What sort of fish do you release back into the ocean for the fish I buy?</strong></p><p>At our Biota Marine Life Nursery in Palau, we release rabbitfish into the protected waters to help restock the oceans. They are hardy fish whose stocks are depleted because they are popular fish to eat.

Often aquarium fish are exposed to many different holding tanks with different fish which can be breeding grounds for disease and other problems. The Biota Aquarium avoids these problems by sourcing fish that are sustainably bred. Best of all? This means we can ensure our backers that nothing is taken from the ocean.  1st Stretch Goal Reached at $75K! We're happy to announce that we will be offering a new coral option! This cultured soft coral with eight tentacles has a special pumping action that is mesmerizing! It's one of the few corals that continuously creates motion, it is pinkish tan in color and grows by encrusting over rocks or even the aquarium glass. Pom-Pom Xenia should be placed in the sand under direct light away from other corals due to their prolific growth.       As a third generation Floridian, Kevin witnessed the decline of Florida's coral reefs first-hand. An avid saltwater aquarist for over 40 years, Kevin began his career by earning his Microbiology and Cell Science degree from the University of Florida. He began breeding fish and corals in 1991, and started a commercial coral farm in 1995.Kevin was one of the founding members and CEO of the world's most successful marine ornamental fish, coral, and giant clam farm. He was a sustainable marine life collector in the Florida Keys and worked for one of the largest marine wholesalers.A passion for marine protection led him to the non-profit, Coral Restoration Foundation, where he now serves on the Board of Directors.Biota Aquariums is a business born from a dream, and Kevin is excited to inspire others to become future marine enthusiasts. Tom Bowling has been fascinated by marine life since he worked in the aquarium trade in Australia as a teen. After working in the industry, he witnessed seemingly unnecessary wild fish deaths and has dedicated his work to breeding fish more suited to aquarium life.Along with his marine science degree, Tom is also a qualified commercial diver. After a period breeding seahorses (and discovering several new species) while running an aquaculture farm in the Marshall Islands, Tom and his family moved to the remote pacific islands of Palau.As a Director of Biota Palau, Tom breeds Biota's specialized fish suited to aquarium life. To date, Tom has bred the colorful Clown Triggerfish, Pajama Cardinals, and Mandarinfish among others through sustainable aquaculture practices. Tom's dream is to help share with others a deep appreciation for our ocean and ocean life.       Biota has partnered with premier home aquatics brand, Fluval, to bring you the most compact tank on the market. With its small size of only 22""L x 11.5""W x 15""H, the 13.5 gallon tank fits almost anywhere. Because it doesn't require the bulky cabinetry so many home aquariums do, you can conveniently place your Biota Aquarium on a counter top, dresser, or media stand. And unlike a plastic aquarium, the clear glass is very durable and has a unique, modern floating base design, making it the perfect addition to any room in your home or office.  Additionally, the touch feature LED light has been engineered to promote coral growth while creating a glowing effect highlighting the beautiful colors of the fish and corals - but it looks beautiful too.       Biota Aquariums was founded to help inspire the next generation of marine enthusiasts. By keeping a saltwater aquarium, one can truly begin to appreciate its beauty, as well as, better understand the delicate balance of our oceans.You can use the aquarium to teach your friends, loved ones, and even yourself about the wonders of the marine environment. Biota Aquariums is an environmentally responsible company that offers only sustainably bred fish and takes nothing from the ocean, teaching humanity to respect the ocean and inspiring them to learn about ocean conservation.As a company, we aid in ocean conservation by raising our marine life in captivity. To do this sustainably and humanely, Biota has its own beautiful marine life nursery on the Pacific island of Palau, one of the world's largest marine reserves. Biota's Rainford's Goby comes from this nursery! The clownfish are sourced from a local facility and are conditioned at Biota's Marine Life Center in Florida along with the live rock and corals.     It's Biota's  mission to conserve our oceans for the generations to come. Aside from marine life education and appreciation, we want to directly give back to our ocean's delicate ecosystem.  With every Biota purchase, we promise that for every fish bought another fish will be released into the protected waters of Palau. Donations will also go to ocean conversation via the 1% for the Planet™.     1. Biota Aquarium Tank | 2. Heater | 3. Salt Bags | 4. Light Timer | 5. Fish Food |   6. Water Conditioner | 7.

Podcasts for Peace is a community-based organization in Acahualinca, Managua, Nicaragua.  We teach digital arts to children and youth to promote critical thinking and community leadership.  Our classes and projects equip participants to become agents of change by starting with their own lives and then looking out at the needs of their neighbors. 
We are collaborating with the barrio soccer league on a project to eliminate illegal dumping and trash burning near our athletic field.  Our project includes several phases to achieve the goal of eliminating this persistent environmental hazard which contributes to asthma and lung disease (both prevalent in the neighborhood).  We will paint a community mural on the wall surrounding the field to promote environmental stewardship.  Youth will also document and reflect on this process through digital arts, learning the value and power of democratic, community-based media.  
By the end of our project we will have a green space for healthy recreation.  Youth in our program and the soccer league will have the opportunity to participate and take on leadership roles during every step of the process, from planting trees and shrubs to painting murals and installing a new playground.  
How You Will Help 
Your donation will cover the cost of paint and materials for the mural designed by teams from the soccer league.

 We will spend $300 on paint and accessories for a  mural which will border our athletic field (approximately 8 x 25 feet in size).  
Your donations will also provide uniforms for the soccer teams that participate by cleaning litter, planting trees, painting murals, and work to keep the space beautiful. 

 With $600 we can buy 144 uniforms, one for each player in the league.  The uniforms will include: jersey, shorts, and soccer socks for every child.
If we exceed our goal, we will take the teams on an outing to a special field and celebrate the end of the season with a big party!! 
    
How We Will Say Thank You 
Every donor will receive a personalized digital thank you letter from Podcasts for Peace and one of the barrio soccer teams.  
Donors who give more than $25 will receive a handmade bracelet from one of the students in Podcasts for Peace’s artisanship program.  
Donors who give more than $50 will receive a handmade bracelet and be honored in a special section of the environmental mural. 
 
The Impact
Your donation promotes environmental stewardship through shared community art in the form of a mural designed by youth.    
Our soccer teams are organized by youth who do not have the resources at home to purchase matching uniforms.  At the completion of this project, each team will have matching uniforms to affirm their group identity already demonstrated through sportsmanship and friendship.
Your donation supports a piece of a larger project which includes planting trees, creating a garden and installing a playground for small children with the help of a community business and the mayor’s office.  
Podcasts for Peace led a community campaign to install speed bumps last year. Now there are 6 safer streets with a total of 13 speed bumps here in the barrio.  We had excellent support and participation from community members.  This year, with your support and collaboration, we will execute an equally successful project focusing on a major environmental issue that affects the health and wellbeing of youth and children.  
 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot make a financial contribution there are other ways to support our project.

You can share a link for this site with friends who may want to contribute. 
You can send us a letter of support to share with the kids who are working hard.  
You can also donate computers to Podcasts for Peace to support ongoing digital arts education in a neighborhood with limited resources.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>I am a 46 year old single mother, (my husband
passed away from cancer in September 2007), of three children. We live in a beautiful rural town in South Australia. I have an
auto-immune liver disorder which has restricted much of what I have been able
to do in my life, but one of the things I was told was that I probably would
never have any children. Well, I was blessed with 3, however, it has not all
been smooth sailing. My youngest two children are boys and both been diagnosed
with Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p>
<p>WHEN
DID WE GET A DIAGNOSIS</p>
<p>My youngest son began exhibiting signs of
something ‘not quite right’ before he was two. One day at a playgroup we
attended, another mother asked me if I had considered having him tested for
Autism. At first I was astounded. Autism! This was a disorder I had heard of
but had no idea about. And had never associated it with regard to my son. I
decided that maybe her suggestion had some merit so I thought I should follow up
her comment. Eventually the testing led to the confirmed diagnosis of Classic non-verbal
Autism. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>I remember exactly how
I felt when the diagnosis was delivered. It was as though I was inside a big bubble and
although I could hear and understand everything I was being told, I just could not reconcile
the diagnosis with my son. A million thoughts crowded my mind and although I
felt the sadness of what the diagnosis would mean for my son, unlike some other
families stories I have read, I did not feel a loss for the ‘little boy that
could have been’. I did not have the
feeling that I had lost my son, but I did almost immediately realize that this
son was going to be lots of work and was going to require lots of my time.</p>
<p>I
immediately started looking into “WHAT NEXT” and found a professor who
specialised in ABA – Applied Behaviour Analysis. I enrolled myself and my son in
this program in Adelaide, a 2 ½ hour drive from Port Pirie, secured a place to
stay, a carer for my older son in Adelaide with us, a carer for my daughter
here in Port Pirie and organized my husband’s meals etc for the entire time we
would be away. The program required my son and myself to be at the university
for entire days at a time whilst I learned the program and Tobias learned what
was expected from common directions such as, “sit in this chair”, and “find the
red spoon”. Each evening after collecting my other son, we returned to our
cabin, extremely tired but still with the energy to go to the playground and
play on the equipment and share many laughs and fun times. Once returning to
Pirie at the conclusion of the program, it was my turn to “school” Tobias with
the new lessons we had been taught. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Skip through a few
years, and now I found myself having some severe difficulties with my elder
son, Zakary. After several visits to specialists over many months we found
ourselves at the same point as we had years earlier with Tobias. </p>
<p>Diagnosis – High functioning Asperger’s Syndrome. Oh
My, that was kind of a big hit. Oh, well, not much to do but just keep on the
best we could so, that’s exactly what happened. I continued to do therapy with
Tobias, but now I started specific learning with Zakary to enable him to keep
moving forward.</p>
<p>Life was never easy, it seemed that if I was not unwell
and having tests, then one of the boys was having difficulties in one or
another area. And all the time, we were attending speech sessions,
occupational therapy sessions, meditation sessions, eating sessions (how to eat
and what to eat) – “No, stones are not food, we do not eat them”, and play sessions
so they could learn how to play. THEN……… just when it was time for Tobias to
start school, my husband was diagnosed with cancer. Now not only did I have to
help the boys get through each day, I also had to explain, somehow, that their
daddy was sick and was not going to be with us always. After a very short
illness of only 10 months, my beautiful husband eventually gave in and we were
left alone. </p>
<p>Now, the fun began. I had to find work to pay the bills and somehow
juggle my daughter’s high school years, all of my boy’s sessions and my health
issues by myself. It has all been moving on as things are prone to do, but
unfortunately being able to “keep up” is about all I have been able to do.<span>  </span></p>
<p>We now find ourselves in a situation where Tobias is
having extreme meltdowns both in and out of school. I have been required to
leave my employment and have just recovered from the second cracked rib
sustained from a kick whilst attempting to stop Tobias from banging his head on
the ground. </p>
<p>Tobias is a loving, caring boy who is extremely sad
after every incident, however his autism prevents him from being able to
control the anxiety he feels and the way he expresses his frustration is with aggression.
</p>
<p>I have the opportunity to receive an autism companion
dog for Tobias, which would assist him with his aggression and would also allow
Zakary and myself the ability to go out with Tobias, as at the present time, we
are unable to go anywhere for fear of Tobias’ meltdowns. </p>
<p>In spite of all the dilemmas Tobias has faced in his life
he is a happy boy who loves his family so very much. Although Tobias is classified
non-verbal he does have a limited vocabulary and “I love you” is something he
says frequently and from his heart. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>What I am trying to achieve with this site is to be
able to fund a therapy dog for Tobias, to allow him to have a friend who will
love him no matter what and at the same time will be able to calm and settle
him to enable better human connections to occur as well.<span>  </span></p>
<p>What an
autism dog will do for Tobias</p>
<p>Autism dogs are more than just a friend for the person
they are bonded with. Some of the benefits of an autism dog are:</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>A
reduction in anxiety and stress of both child and parents</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Engagement
of entire family</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Improved
sleeping patterns</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Development
of communication and social skills</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>The
friendship and unconditional love that a pet provides</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span><i>Assistance Dogs increase safety by
preventing a child from wandering or running away in public places as they walk
tethered next to a child while the parent controls the actions of the dog.
Assistance Dogs are also trained to provide deep pressure by laying across a
child’s lap to help calm them and to make contact with a child to help diffuse
a meltdown. These dogs can also be trained
to track their companion so if the child wanders, they can assist in locating
them.<span>  </span></i></p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span><i>These dogs help the child move
through their day successfully and assist in calming and settling activities as
required.</i></p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span><i>The purpose of an assistance dog is
to assist the child to successfully move through their day with limited stress
and aggression.</i></p>
<p>I have located an autism dog training program which
will be able to supply us a dog and although these dogs can cost upward of
$50,000.00 to purchase, house and train, for the trainers, the family of the
recipient are only required to fund $25,000.00 of that figure. It is also a
requirement that the property the dog will be residing at is suitable for
living and playing.</p>
<p>In order to do this, I first need to “dog proof” our
backyard. Because I have been working to just pay bills and cover therapy
sessions up to this point, I have not been able to put any funds into the care
and maintenance of our yard. This has unfortunately resulted in us not being
able to walk past our back door. The yard is very overgrown, there are prickle
bushes everywhere with all the grass that was there having long since died,
leaving bare ground which has easily been covered by the ever encroaching
prickle bushes, and to make it worse there is no cover over any part of our
backyard meaning no shade in any area. </p>
<p>I
have asked several contractors to give me prices to develop the backyard by
clearing all weeds and prickle bushes, putting down some sort of base and
laying some grass for the dog to be able to play and toilet on, and erecting
fencing to keep the dog in a small area and therefore, safe. These prices have
ranged from between $25,000 to $35,000.</p>
<p>So
let’s break that down:</p>
<p>An
Autism Assistance Dog:<span>  $25,000.00</span></p>
<p>Yard
clearing:<span>  $35,000.00
</span></p>
<p>So,
although this cost of<span>  $60,000.00 is my
eventual goal, I am starting smaller to at least start  the process of having
the yard cleared in preparation for the time, I am sure, we will be able to
bring home a special friend for Tobias to love.</span></p>

<ul><li>helping us to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.</li></ul>

Autism dogs are more than just a friend for the person

These dogs help the child move

I have located an autism dog training program which

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Bamboo Lota is a social venture that aims to address deforestation and poverty in Malawi through the introduction of <strong>bamboo charcoal</strong>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>(Already know all about Bamboo Lota and the deforestation issue in Malawi? If so, please feel free to go straight to the perks on the right!)</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The majority of households in Malawi use firewood or charcoal for cooking and heating, but current charcoal production is unsustainable and puts heavy strain on forest reserves in the country. By utilizing local, fast growing bamboo, the project aims to produce a more environmentally friendly alternative to current tree-originated charcoal while enabling reforestation efforts to take place in ecologically-strained areas, specifically targeting the Zomba region. Bamboo Lota envisions bringing environmental stewardship to the forefront of community practices while transitioning current charcoal producers into more sustainable bamboo charcoal briquette production. “Lota” means “to dream” in Chichewa and our dream is to bring an innovative model of charcoal production to communities in Malawi.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>(Picture: Giant bamboo growing in Zomba)</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The project was started by Kyson, Joanna, and Stephanie, classmates from a UC Berkeley course called Entrepreneurship to Address Global Poverty.</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>After receiving funding from two social venture competitions in 2010, the team traveled to Malawi to conduct a feasibility study and meet with local charcoal producing communities that could benefit from the new concept. The team received an overwhelmingly positive response to the project and discovered the abundance of locally growing bamboo throughout the southern region. The trip was an eye-opening experience to the highs and lows of tackling such a pervasive issue.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In 2011, the project became an official 501(c)3 nonprofit organization and has been conducting research on charcoal-based energy alternative technologies. The team is more dedicated than ever to making a difference in the Malawi and can’t wait to go back.</span></p>

Bamboo Lota is a social venture that aims to address deforestation and poverty in Malawi through the introduction of bamboo charcoal.
(Already know all about Bamboo Lota and the deforestation issue in Malawi? If so, please feel free to go straight to the perks on the right!)
The majority of households in Malawi use firewood or charcoal for cooking and heating, but current charcoal production is unsustainable and puts heavy strain on forest reserves in the country. By utilizing local, fast growing bamboo, the project aims to produce a more environmentally friendly alternative to current tree-originated charcoal while enabling reforestation efforts to take place in ecologically-strained areas, specifically targeting the Zomba region. Bamboo Lota envisions bringing environmental stewardship to the forefront of community practices while transitioning current charcoal producers into more sustainable bamboo charcoal briquette production. “Lota” means “to dream” in Chichewa and our dream is to bring an innovative model of charcoal production to communities in Malawi.

(Picture: Giant bamboo growing in Zomba)
The project was started by Kyson, Joanna, and Stephanie, classmates from a UC Berkeley course called Entrepreneurship to Address Global Poverty.



After receiving funding from two social venture competitions in 2010, the team traveled to Malawi to conduct a feasibility study and meet with local charcoal producing communities that could benefit from the new concept. The team received an overwhelmingly positive response to the project and discovered the abundance of locally growing bamboo throughout the southern region. The trip was an eye-opening experience to the highs and lows of tackling such a pervasive issue.
In 2011, the project became an official 501(c)3 nonprofit organization and has been conducting research on charcoal-based energy alternative technologies. The team is more dedicated than ever to making a difference in the Malawi and can’t wait to go back.
About Malawi

(Picture via Google)
The landlocked African country is one of the least developed countries in the world and boasts a population of over 15 million people. 85% of the population live in rural areas with low access to basic health and educational services. The majority are poor smallholder farmers who rely on subsistence agriculture to survive and are highly vulnerable to changing climate conditions—drought, flooding, erosion, etc. Despite the harsh realities of poverty, the country has remained largely a peaceful country and boasts a rich culture of kindness and friendliness. The country has been dubbed the “Warm Heart of Africa”.
Why Charcoal?

(Picture: Transporters taking charcoal to market)
Charcoal is often seen today as a backwards and obsolete fuel source. However, for the majority of both urban and rural households in Malawi, charcoal and firewood usage is a way of life and is the only option available. Only 5% of households in Malawi have access to electricity. 

However, local dependency on this cheap fuel source is contributing to a dire deforestation problem.  In total, between 1990 and 2010, Malawi lost 16.9% of its forest cover, or around 659,000 hectares—one of the highest deforestation rates in Southeastern Africa.

(Picture: Illegal charcoal production in the hills of Zomba)
This has led to the criminalization of the trade and increased strain on the government to find a more lucrative business for illegal charcoal producers and traders. Currently, the informal charcoal trade employs an estimated 93,000 people—many of which are living below the poverty line. If regulated, it is a multi-million dollar industry that has the capability to become a top agricultural earner alongside tobacco and tea with an estimated worth of $41.3 million in Malawi’s four largest cities alone.

Benjamin, who has an MS in Structural Engineering, is in the process of engineering a more robust packaging setup and we plan to achieve less than 1% breaking rate by the time Window Aquatica ships to our backers.Not many varieties of fish can live in a window where temperatures are more variable than the rest of the house. So far we've only verified two species that do really well in the window: Rosy Barbs and Mosquito Fish. We plan on expanding the list of viable fish, but we are worried that newbie aquarists will try to put other types of fish and the fish will die. To mitigate this problem, we will be developing a simple and obvious user guide to be shipped with the kit.",25.0,1,"1 Campaign

</h2><p><strong>Notre premier objectif est d’obtenir les fonds suffisants pour acheter les matériaux de construction d’un dortoir pour que les volontaires (locaux ou internationaux) que nous souhaitons héberger </strong>puissent participer à nos ateliers de permaculture. Autre avantage : <strong>notre site sera prêt à servir de point d'évacuation, de cuisine communautaire et de zone de sécurité en cas de catastrophe naturelle </strong>(depuis septembre dernier, suite aux éruptions du Mont Agung et, plus récemment, aux tremblements de terre sur Lombok, le groupement Emas Hitam coopère avec l'association Agung Siaga en apportant bénévolement son soutien sur la logistique et le tri des donations).</p><p><strong>Voici les étapes de notre financement : </strong></p><ul>
<li>
<strong>$5000 : Dortoir</strong> (fondation, structure, lits superposés, aménagement intérieur, toiture, et balcon)</li>
<li>
<strong>+$1000 : Cuisine commune</strong> (fondation, structure, cuisine traditionnelle Balinaise, four naturel, rocket stove, système de traitement des eaux grises, filtre à eau, plomberie, évier, matériels de cuisine)</li>
<li>
<strong>+$500 : Système de stockage d'eau de pluie</strong> (plateforme, réservoir d'eau de pluie, enveloppe en bambou, tuyauterie, robinets, filtre en maille)</li>
<li>
<strong>+1000 : Salle de bain commune </strong>(fondation, toiture, structure, toilettes sèches, douche solaire, système de traitement des eaux grises )</li>

Nous provenons tous d'horizons différents et bien que nos parcours furent riches en expériences, chacun de nous avait l’intime conviction qu'il lui manquait quelque chose pour pleinement s’accomplir. Nous avons trouvé la solution lorsque nous nous sommes reconnectés avec la nature. En travaillant ensemble, nous avons réalisé l'impact que nous pouvions avoir en enseignant aux gens comment cultiver leur propre nourriture et régénérer leurs terres, en parfaite autonomie. C’est ainsi qu’avec la communauté locale, nous avons créé l'Oasis Ancut Garden. Nous sommes convaincus de l’influence positive de ce projet sur notre monde, en prenant soin de nous, de notre planète et de la redistribution équitable de nos excédents.

OUR GOALSOur first goal is to create a dormitory space where local volunteers, international guests and workshop participants can stay and learn permaculture with us. Our dorm and site will also be ready to be used as an evacuation point, community kitchen and/or safe zone for any future natural disasters (since September last year, Emas Hitam has been involved in Agung Siaga’s relief efforts for Mt Agung’s eruptions, and recently the Lombok earthquakes through volunteering, donation sorting and logistics support).The following are our funding milestones: 

$5000: Dormitory Accommodation (foundation, structure, bunk beds, interior fittings, roofing, and balcony)

+$1000: Shared kitchen (foundation, structure, traditional Balinese kitchen, natural oven, rocket stove, greywater system, water filter, plumbing, sink, cooking supplies)

+$500: Rainwater storage system (platform, rainwater tank, bamboo casing, piping, taps, mesh filter)

+1000: Shared bathroom (foundation, roofing, structure, dry compost toilets, solar showers, greywater system)

+$2500: Family bungalow with separate bathroom (foundation, structure, beds, interior fittings, roofing, balcony, dry compost toilet, shower area)
If we achieve over $10,000, we will propose other facilities- voted on by our donor community, such as a shared living space or transportation to collect village waste! Image: Dorm design
2.            OUR ‘WHY’Why not? Because we can, because we have to, because we want to! We understand that the old system is dying, as well as the old way of doing things. We know how to find regenerative solutions based on collaboration that are bound by the ethics and principles of permaculture. We want to design Ancut Garden Oasis (AGO) as a whole system, where each element and human being can achieve their highest purpose- trusting each other, and creating a community life that can be an example for others.3. WHO WE ARE  We are a group of friends who share a similar vision of how we want to live our lives. We all come from different backgrounds and have had successful lives so far, however each one of felt that there was something missing. We found it when we connected with the land. Working together, we realised the impact that we can have by teaching people how to grow their own food and regenerate their land. So together with the local community, we created Ancut Garden Oasis. We believe we can have a positive impact in our world, by caring for people, our Planet and with the fair redistribution of our surplus. We want to be a part of something bigger than ourselves, and we know that we cannot do it alone.4.   OUR STORYAfter Kadek graduated from Vandana Shiva’s Navdanya University in 2015, Kadek and Feny were inspired to co-found Emas Hitam Indonesia (EHI) with the support of other young Indonesians in December 2015.Since this time, the team have been actively contributing to food sovereignty and sustainability movements in Bali and across Indonesia. Our trainings include:

Sekaroh, East Lombok (June-July 2016): EHI trained a group of 32 farmers struggling to grow a single crop of corn each year, teaching them how to regenerate their soil applying permaculture design principles.

Karangasem, East Bali (Nov 2017): The EHI team delivered a customized workshop for 3 villages on nitrogen-fixation, the use of vetiver grass as erosion prevention, and how to create a sustainable business growing moringa oleifera.

Malaka, Io Kufeu, West Timor (Aug 2017): EHI’s training introduced the concept of regenerative agriculture to 3 communities dealing with unsustainable farming practises. 
In November 2017, we co-created the JAGA Indonesia Festival: Celebrating Agroecology and Seed Freedom- a free event for over 250 Indonesian farmers, students, government representatives and activists in Bali and Java. Kadek’s Navdanya University teachers came especially from India to share their practical workshops on agroecology, food sovereignty, liquid compost, and seed-saving.Additionally, we have been involved in training, consulting and speaking engagements including Ubud Food Festival, Slow Food Bali events, IDEP’s Introduction to Permaculture Course, and Udayana University’s Earth Day student workshop.
5.    OUR SITESince December 2017, we have been operating at Ancut Garden, our new site in Petulu, which is 100% pesticide free, chemical fertilizer-free and non-GMO. In Balinese, ‘ancut’ (pronounced ‘anchoot’), means the ‘border’ or ‘edge’. It is the place where two realities meet- life as we know it and the life that we want to live! Since moving here, we have built:

Our 2-storey timber AGO Eco-house with dry composting toilet (supported by Permafund Australia)

Seedling nursery and worm farm


Hot compost area (4x compost bays, biochar kiln, chipper and leaf cutter machines)

Garden design (3x ricefields, kitchen gardens, raised mandala beds, 3x banana circles, 2x ponds, 10x biopori)

Food forest (fruit trees and root crops including moringa, bananas, taro, sweet potato, cassava, jackfruit, durian, rambutan, snakefruit, white mango, papaya, sugarcane, coconuts, vanilla, pepper and many more!)
Waste management system
Access and parking

IN PROGRESS: community learning space, 2nd composting toilet, grocery space, AGO Bamboo house
Image: Before/After photos of 1) AGO Eco-house 2) Community Space 3) Compost Area
6.    OUR COMMUNITY PROJECTS
Compost the World: Supported by AVI and the Planet Wheeler Foundation’s Community Grants Scheme- we have created an on-site organic materials processing and recycling facility that recovers agricultural waste from our own garden and the community, and processes it into soil-building materials and compost products- including biochar, cocopeat, mulch, worm castings, worm tea, and hot compost! Together with the local farming community, we aim to transition Banjar Petulu Desa to organic rice production, using our compost facility to regenerate the soil.
Little Seeds Children’s Workshops: Education program for the local Petulu kindergarten and schools around Bali.
Petulu & Tabanan Subak Site Tour: Workshops for international tour groups about the Subak (UNESCO-listed Balinese rice irrigation system), permaculture, waste management, bamboo construction, and sustainable rice-planting in our own village and in Central-North Bali.

8.    YOUR IMPACTWhy do we do crowdfunding?We want Ancut Garden Oasis to be a catalyst for change, not just for Bali, but for YOU- the people who share our vision. Although we will be the first recipients, everyone collaborating with us will know that they are part of the solution- it’s not just about us, its about ALL of us. AGO provides an example of an integrated community life in which there is no competition (win/lose), only collaboration (win-win). Kadek is already being seen as a local ‘trailblazer’ in our community through alternative ways of rice farming and soil regeneration. We are living in a critical time- and supporting our locally-owned project is pledging your faith and belief that the world can be a better place.
9.    RISKS AND CHALLENGESFor almost 3 years, we have continued to find innovative solutions to the problems we have been faced with - one of Bill Mollison’s permaculture design principles is “the problem is the solution”.Through limited resources, drought, Bali’s current water crisis, torrential rainy seasons, and language barriers, we continue to stay passionate and motivated. Our only challenge is to maintain the continuity of what we have already applied, which is why we have chosen crowdfunding to move our project forward at this time. We have come too far not to keep going. We are at the grassroots- for us, the only way is up!
10.    WHAT OUR SUPPORTERS SAYSince 2016, we have been opening up our sites to the general public: here’s what they have said: 
""Happy Permaculture Day! I came to learn about agriculture, but what I got was an introduction to a new philosophy! It's truly inspiring that the principles and the practise of permaculture can be applied in all walks of life. I'm hoping to come back to learn more about the agriculture part of it, and hoping to apply the philosophy in my personal and professional life. Thank you for organizing this! I'm grateful to have met this foundation"" – Septira (Jakarta, Java, Indonesia)

""So this is the first time I come to this foundation, actually I don't know what will I do here, But I think the people here are very kind, so friendly, Before I knew that this foundation has a good program that to help the people who get suffered because of Agung erupting. So because of I am Balinese, I am so happy to know about that. There are so many people from abroad that really care with us here in Bali. Thank you! So my new friend show me your good activity and I think I will love it. Thank you."" – Ari (Plaga, Bali, Indonesia)

""Les agradezco mucho por lo compartido, la experienca y el intercambio. Gracias por sequir trabajando y colaborando a favor de le tierra. Salud y buena vida"" – Melisa (Argentina)

“I am now very interested in permaculture after seeing all the amazing things Emas Hitam is doing. I hope Emas Hitam continues to go from strength to strength! Thank you for showing me the power of passionate people through this garden"" – Mel (Australia)

 “Vous faites un travail fantastique ici !!! Congratulations pour tout ce que vous apportez à la Terre, notre belle planète que nous partageons tous. Continuez, n’abandonnez jamais, et sachez qu’il y a beaucoup de personnes travaillant avec vous à travers le monde !!! "" – Thomas (France)

""Thanks for letting me into your beautiful project and people. It is very inspiring to find people fighting for similar goals far away from home and under different environments” – Daniel (Denmark)

""Om Swastiyastu. Terima kasih untuk pagi yang sangat luar biasa. Hari ini kami belajar banyak hal dan mengingat masa kecil kami melihat Kakek dan Nenek kami bertani. Bless of live for Balinese Farmer"" – Surya (Ubud, Bali, Indonesia)

""Saya sangat menyukai kegiatan membudidayakan tanaman organic yg alami. Sehat dan bebas kimia. Sehingga dapat dikonsumsi dengan aman dan membuat tubuh kita terbebas dari sat yang dapat membuat masalah dalam tubuh kita. Hendaknya kita terus kembangkan aktivitas dan budaya konsumsi makanan sehat. Thanks"" - Amin (Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia)

1.   NOS OBJECTIFS
Notre premier objectif est d’obtenir les fonds suffisants pour acheter les matériaux de construction d’un dortoir pour que les volontaires (locaux ou internationaux) que nous souhaitons héberger puissent participer à nos ateliers de permaculture. Autre avantage : notre site sera prêt à servir de point d'évacuation, de cuisine communautaire et de zone de sécurité en cas de catastrophe naturelle (depuis septembre dernier, suite aux éruptions du Mont Agung et, plus récemment, aux tremblements de terre sur Lombok, le groupement Emas Hitam coopère avec l'association Agung Siaga en apportant bénévolement son soutien sur la logistique et le tri des donations).Voici les étapes de notre financement : 

$5000 : Dortoir (fondation, structure, lits superposés, aménagement intérieur, toiture, et balcon)

+$1000 : Cuisine commune (fondation, structure, cuisine traditionnelle Balinaise, four naturel, rocket stove, système de traitement des eaux grises, filtre à eau, plomberie, évier, matériels de cuisine)

+$500 : Système de stockage d'eau de pluie (plateforme, réservoir d'eau de pluie, enveloppe en bambou, tuyauterie, robinets, filtre en maille)

+1000 : Salle de bain commune (fondation, toiture, structure, toilettes sèches, douche solaire, système de traitement des eaux grises )

+$2500 : Bungalow familial avec salle de bain privée (fondation, structure, lits, aménagement intérieur, toiture, balcon, toilettes sèches, douche)
Si nous dépassons 10,000 $, nous proposerons d'autres installations votées par notre communauté de donateurs, tels qu'un espace de vie partagé, un véhicule pour la collecte des déchets du villages, etc...Image: Dormitory plans (10x10m octagonal design, pitched roof and balcony on terrace)2. NOTRE “POURQUOI”Pourquoi pas ? Parce que nous pouvons, parce que nous devons, parce que nous voulons! Nous comprenons que l'ancien système est en train de mourir, tout comme l'ancienne façon de faire les choses. Nous savons comment trouver des solutions régénératrices basées sur la collaboration, et liées à l'éthique et aux principes de la permaculture. Nous voulons concevoir l'Oasis Ancut Garden comme un système complet, où chaque élément et chaque être humain peuvent atteindre leur objectif le plus élevé: se faire confiance et créer un lieu departage qui peut être un exemple pour les autres.3. QUI SOMMES-NOUS ?Nous sommes un groupe d'amis qui partagent les mêmes choix de vie. Nous provenons tous d'horizons différents et bien que nos parcours furent riches en expériences, chacun de nous avait l’intime conviction qu'il lui manquait quelque chose pour pleinement s’accomplir. Nous avons trouvé la solution lorsque nous nous sommes reconnectés avec la nature. En travaillant ensemble, nous avons réalisé l'impact que nous pouvions avoir en enseignant aux gens comment cultiver leur propre nourriture et régénérer leurs terres, en parfaite autonomie. C’est ainsi qu’avec la communauté locale, nous avons créé l'Oasis Ancut Garden. Nous sommes convaincus de l’influence positive de ce projet sur notre monde, en prenant soin de nous, de notre planète et de la redistribution équitable de nos excédents. Grâce à votre accompagnement, nous pourrons démontrer de façon factuelle qu’il est possible de faire partie de quelque chose de plus grand que nous, de proposer de nouvelles perspectives pour une vie plus saine et harmonieuse avec l'environnement.4. NOTRE HISTOIREAprès avoir obtenu son diplôme  à l’Université Navdanya de Vandana Shiva en 2015, Kadek et Feny ont été inspirés par la co-création d’Emas Hitam Indonesia (EHI) avec le soutien d’autres jeunes Indonésiens en décembre 2015.Depuis ce temps, l’équipe a activement contribué aux mouvements de souveraineté alimentaire et de développement durable à Bali et en Indonésie. Nos formations comprennentnotamment :

Sekaroh, Est de Lombok (Juin-Juillet 2016) : EHI a formé un groupe de 32 agriculteurs qui luttaient chaque année pour cultiver une monoculture de maïs, en leur enseignant comment régénérer leur sol, en appliquant les principes de la conception en permaculture.

Karangasem, Est de Bali (Nov. 2017) : L'équipe EHI a organisé un atelier personnalisé pour 3 villages sur la fixation de l'azote, l'utilisation du vétiver comme moyen de prévention de l'érosion et la création d'une entreprise durable pour le moringa oleifera.

Malaka, Io Kufeu, Timor Occidental (Août 2017) : la formation EHI a introduit le concept d’agriculture régénérative dans 3 communautés qui s’occupent de pratiques agricoles non durables.
En Novembre 2017, nous avons co-créé le festival ”JAGA Indonesia: Celebrating Agroecology and Seed Freedom”, un événement gratuit pour plus de 250 agriculteurs, étudiants, représentants gouvernementaux et activistes indonésiens de Bali et Java. Les professeurs de l’Université Navdanya de Kadek sont venus spécialement d’Inde, pour partager leurs ateliers pratiques sur l’agroécologie, la souveraineté alimentaire, le compost liquide et la conservation des semences.En outre, nous avons participé à des formations, consultations et conférences, notamment au ”Ubud Food Festival”, aux événements ”Slow Food Bali”, au cours ”Introduction à la permaculture” de l’organisation IDEP et à l’atelier des étudiants de l’Université Udayana ”Earth Day”.5. NOTRE SITEDepuis Décembre 2017, nous opérons à Ancut Garden, notre nouveau site à Petulu, 100% sans pesticides, sans engrais chimiques et sans OGM. En balinais, ”ancut” (prononcé anchout) signifie la ”frontière” ou ”bordure”. C'est le lieu où deux réalités se rencontrent, la vie que nous connaissons et la vie que nous voulons vivre! Depuis notre déménagement, nous avons construit :

Notre Eco-maison de deux étages avec toilettes sèches 


Pépinière et ferme de vers de terre


Zone de compostage à chaud (4x bacs  pour collecter les matériaux compostables, four à biocharbon, broyeur et machines à découper les feuilles)

Design du jardin (3 x rizières, jardins potagers, jardin en mandala , 3 ”banana circles”, 2 étangs, 10 ”biopori”)

Forêt vivrière (arbres fruitiers et racines: moringas, bananes, taros, patates douces, maniocs, jacquiers, durians, ramboutans, fruits du serpent, mangues blanches, papayes, cannes à sucre, noix de coco, vanille, poivre et bien d'autres !)
Système de management des déchets 
Accès et stationnement

EN COURS : espace d'apprentissage , 2ème toilettes sèches , épicerie, AGO Bamboo house, structures à compost
Image: Avant/Après photos de 1) AGO Eco-house 2) Espace d'apprentissage 3) Compost Area
6.    NOS PROJETS AVEC LA COMMUNAUTE

“Compost the World” : Soutenu par le Community Grants Scheme de la fondation Planet Wheeler et AVI- Nous avons une installation de traitement et de recyclage des matières organiques sur site qui récupère les déchets agricoles de notre jardin et de la communauté et les transforme en matériaux de construction et en produits de compost (biocharbons, fibres de coco, paillis, excrétions solides et liquides de verres de terre, et compost chaud)! En collaboration avec la communauté agricole locale, nous visons la transition du quartier ”Petulu Desa”, afin de convertir les rizières en biologique, et en utilisant notre installation de compost, afin de régénérer les sols.
“Little Seeds” ateliers pour enfants : Programme d’ateliers  pour enfants ,  auprès des écoles  de Petulu  et à travers Bali.
“Petulu & Tabanan Subak Site Tour” : Ateliers pour groupes de touristes internationaux à propos des Subak (système Balinais  concernant l'irrigation des rizières  et classé à l'UNESCO), la permaculture, la gestion des déchets, la construction en bambou et la riziculture durable dans notre village et dans le centre-nord de Bali.

VOTRE IMPACTPourquoi faisons-nous  une demande de financement participatif ?Nous voulons que l'Oasis Ancut Garden soit un catalyseur du changement, pas seulement pour Bali, mais pour VOUS, les personnes qui partagent notre vision. Bien que nous soyons les premiers destinataires, tous ceux qui collaborent avec nous, sauront qu’ils font partie de la solution. Il ne s’agit pas seulement de nous, mais de nous TOUS.L'Oasis Ancut Garden fournit un exemple de vie intégré avec une communauté, dans laquelle il n'y a pas de concurrence (gagner/perdre), mais uniquement une collaboration (gagnant/gagnant). Kadek est déjà considéré comme un “pionnier” local dans notre communauté grâce à d'autres méthodes de culture du riz et de régénération des sols. Nous vivons une période critique, collaborer avec notre projet plaide votre foi et votre conviction que le monde peut être meilleur.9.RISQUES ET DEFISDepuis près de 3 ans, nous continuons à trouver des solutions innovantes aux problèmes auxquels nous avons été confrontés (l'un des principes de conception en permaculture de Bill Mollison est “le problème est la solution”).Malgrès des ressources limitées,  la sécheresse, la crise de l’eau à Bali, la saison des pluies torrentielles et les barrières linguistiques, nous continuons à rester passionnés et motivés. Notre seul défi est de maintenir la continuité de ce que nous avons déjà appliqué., raison pour laquelle nous avons choisi le financement participatif pour continuer de faire avancer notre projet. Nous ne pouvons  qu'aller de l'avant !

MERCI POUR LE SOUTIEN !!!  ---------------VERSION EN ESPAÑOL----------------- 1. NUESTROS OBJETIVOSNuestro primer objetivo es crear un dormitorio común para los voluntarios locales, las visitas internacionales y para quienes participen de nuestros talleres. Además, el dormitorio en particular y nuestro sitio en general pueden ser utilizados como punto de evacuación, y / o zona segura en caso de desastres naturales (desde septiembre del año pasado, Emas Hitam ha estado colaborando con Agung Siaga en sus esfuerzos por asistir a las victimas de las erupciones de Volcan Agung, y los terremotos en Lombok brindando nuestro tiempo con apoyo logístico).Lo que tu donación hará posibleEl primer paso:• $ 5000: Alojamiento en dormitorio (cimientos, estructura, literas, accesorios interiores, techos y balcón)Los pasos siguientes:• + $ 1000: cocina compartida (cimientos, estructura, cocina tradicional balinesa, horno natural, cocina de cohetes, sistema de aguas grises, filtro de agua, plomería, fregadero, utensilios de cocina)• + $ 500: sistema de almacenamiento de agua de lluvia (plataforma, tanque de agua de lluvia, carcasa de bambú, tuberías, grifos, filtro de malla)• +1000: baño compartido (cimientos, techos, estructura, baños secos de compost, duchas solares, sistema de aguas grises)• + $ 2500: bungalow familiar con baño separado (cimientos, estructura, camas, accesorios interiores, techo, balcón, inodoro seco de composta, área de ducha)Si logramos más de $10,000, decidiremos cómo utilizar el dinero en consenso con nuestra comunidad de donantes. Algunas ideas son construir un espacio compartido o adquirir un medio de transporte para recoger los desechos de la aldea.2. NUESTRO ‘POR QUE’¿Por que no? Porque podemos, porque tenemos que hacerlo, porque queremos! Entendemos que el viejo sistema está muriendo, así como la vieja manera de hacer las cosas. Sabemos cómo encontrar soluciones regenerativas, basadas en la colaboración y de acuerdo con la ética y los principios de la permacultura. Queremos diseñar Ancut Garden Oasis como un sistema vivo donde cada elemento y cada ser humano pueda manifestarse ampliamente, creando una vida comunitaria que pueda ser un ejemplo para los demás.
3.    QUIENES SOMOSSomos un grupo de amigos con una visión similar respecto de cómo queremos vivir nuestras vidas, a pesar de haber nacido en diferentes culturas. Todos hemos tenido vidas en general exitosas, sin embargo, cada uno de nosotros en algun momento sintió la falta de un significado trascendental. Lo encontramos cuando conectamos con la tierra. Trabajando juntos nos dimos cuenta del impacto que podemos tener compartiendo las herramientas necesarias para que todos puedan cultivar su propia comida y regenerar su tierra. Así fue como, junto con la comunidad local, creamos Ancut Garden Oasis. Creemos que podemos tener un impacto positivo en el mundo, cuidando de las personas, de nuestro planeta y repartiendo nuestro excedente de maera sabia y justa. Queremos ser parte de algo más grande que nosotros mismos, y sabemos que no podemos hacerlo solos. 4. NUESTRA HISTORIATras finalizar sus estudios en Navdanya, la Universidad fundada por Vandana Shiv, en 2015, Kadek, junto con Feny y un grupo de jovenes de Indonesia, co-fundaron Emas Hitam Indonesia (EHI). Desde entonces, esta NGO local ha contribuído activamente con proyectos que abogan por la soberanía alimentaria y la sustentabilidad en Bali y en toda Indonesia.Nuestros programas de entrenamiento incluyen:• Sekaroh, East Lombok (junio-julio de 2016): EHI capacitó a un grupo de 32 agricultores en crisis, incapaces de cultivar su propia tierra, enseñándoles a regenerar su suelo aplicando los principios de diseño de la permacultura.• Karangasem, Bali (noviembre de 2017): El equipo de EHI realizó un taller personalizado para 3 aldeas enseñándoles como acumular nitrógeno en el suelo utilizando Sesbania Grandiflora, cómo usar vetiver para prevenir la erosión y cómo crear un negocio sostenible produciendo Moringa Oleífera.• Malaka, Io Kufeu, Timor Occidental (agosto de 2017): la capacitación de EHI introdujo el concepto de agricultura regenerativa en 3 comunidades agobiadas por el efecto de prácticas agrícolas insostenibles.En noviembre de 2017, co-creamos el Festival JAGA Indonesia: Celebrando la Agroecología y la soberania alimenticia. Fue un evento gratuito al que asistieron más de 250 agricultores, estudiantes, representantes gubernamentales y activistas de Indonesia. Los profesores de Kadek aterrizaron en Bali con el fin de difundir los conceptos de agroecología, soberanía alimentaria, compost líquido y banco de semillas.Además, hemos participado en capacitaciones, consultorías y conferencias varias como en el Ubud Food Festival, eventos con Slow Food Bali, Cursos de Introducción a la Permacultura con IDEP y el taller de estudiantes del Día de la Tierra con Udayana University.5. NUESTRO PROYECTODesde diciembre de 2017, hemos estado desarrollando Ancut Garden, nuestro nuevo sitio en Petulu, que es 100% libre de pesticidas, libre de fertilizantes químicos y de cultivos transgénico. En balinés, 'Ancut' significa 'borde': el lugar donde se encuentran dos realidades: ¡la vida tal como la conocemos y la vida que queremos vivir!Hasta el momento, hemos construido:• Nuestra AGO Eco-casa de 2 plantas con baño de compostaje seco.• Vivero y espacio de vermicultura• Área de compostaje caliente (4x compartimentos de compost, horno de biochar, trituradora y cortadora de hojas)• Jardín (3x arrozales, huertos, camas mandala elevadas, 3 círculos de banana, 2x estanques, 10x biopori)• Bosque comestible (Moringa, bananas, taro, batata, mandioca, durián, rambután, snakefruit, mango, papaya, caña de azúcar, coco, vainilla, pimienta y muchos más!)• Sistema de gestión de residuos• Acceso y estacionamiento• En construccion: aula comunitaria, segundo baño de compostaje, despensa, casa AGO Bamboo.6. NUESTRO TRABAJO CON LA COMUNIDAD• Compost the World: con la ayuda de AVI (Austalian Volunteers International) y Planet Wheeler Foundation a traves de su Community Grants Scheme creamos una instalación de reciclaje y procesamiento de materiales orgánicos que recupera los residuos agrícolas de nuestro jardín y de la comunidad, y los procesa convirtiéndolos en productos como compost, biochar, cocopeat, mantillo y utilizando dichos productos par generar otros proyectos como vermicultura. Junto con la comunidad agrícola local de Banjar Petulu Desa, la idea es generar una transicion hacia la produccion de arroz de manera organica, utilizando nuestras instalaciones de compost para regenerar su suelo.• 'Little Seeds': programa de talleres para niños de la aldea Petulu y para jardines de infantes alrededor de Bali.• Petulu & Tabanan Subak Site Tour: Talleres para grupos de turistas internacionales sobre el sistema Subak (sistema milenario de irrigacion reconocido por la UNESCO como Patrimonio de la Humanidad), permacultura, gestión de residuos, construcción de bambú y plantación sostenible de arroz.7.

Aunque seremos los primeros beneficiarios, todos los que hayan colaborado con nosotros son parte de la solución; se trata de TODOS nosotros. AGO intenta convertirse en un ejemplo de una vida comunitaria en la que no haya competencia (ganar/perder), solo colaboración (ganar-ganar). Kadek ya es considerado por la aldea como un 'pionero' por la maneras alternativas que viene utilizando en la tierra desde 2004 para el cultivo de arroz y la regeneración del suelo. Vivimos un momento crítico. Apoyando nuestro proyecto local es una manifestacion de fe en que el mundo puede ser un lugar mejor.9. RIESGOS Y DESAFIOSDesde hace tres años, venimos encontrando soluciones innovadoras a los problemas con los que nos hemos enfrentado - uno de los principios de diseño de permacultura de Bill Mollison es ""el problema es la solución"". A pesar de las barreras del idioma, la sequía, la crisis del agua en Bali, las temporadas de lluvias torrenciales y el jam karet (tiempo elastico), seguimos motivados. Nuestro desafío es continuar lo que hemos comenzado y es por eso que elegimos crowdfunding para poder seguir desarrollando nuestro sueño.Estamos en el fondo del pozo. Para nosotros, todo solo puede mejorar. GRACIAS!10. LO QUE DICEN QUIENES NOS CONOCENDesde 2016, cada sabado recibidos personas de todo el mundo en nuestro proyecto, y esto es lo que han dicho de nosotros: 1.          ""Les agradezco mucho por lo compartido, la experienca y el intercambio. Gracias por sequir trabajando y colaborando a favor de le tierra. Salud y buena vida"" – Melisa (Argentina)2.         ""Happy Permaculture Day! I came to learn about agriculture, but what I got was an introduction to a new philosophy! It's truly inspiring that the principles and the practise of permaculture can be applied in all walks of life. I'm hoping to come back to learn more about the agriculture part of it, and hoping to apply the philosophy in my personal and professional life. Thank you for organizing this! I'm grateful to have met this foundation"" – Septira (Jakarta, Java, Indonesia)2. ""Om Swastiyastu. Terima kasih untuk pagi yang sangat luar biasa. Hari ini kami belajar banyak hal dan mengingat masa kecil kami melihat Kakek dan Nenek kami bertani. Bless of live for Balinese Farmer"" – Surya (Ubud, Bali, Indonesia)3.         ""So this is the first time I come to this foundation, actually I don't know what will I do here, But I think the people here are very kind, so friendly, Before I knew that this foundation has a good program that to help the people who get suffered because of Agung erupting. So because of I am Balinese, I am so happy to know about that. There are so many people from abroad that really care with us here in Bali. Thank you! So my new friend show me your good activity and I think I will love it. Thank you."" – Ari (Plaga, Bali, Indonesia)4.         “I am now very interested in permaculture after seeing all the amazing things Emas Hitam is doing. I hope Emas Hitam continues to go from strength to strength! Thank you for showing me the power of passionate people through this garden"" – Mel (Australia)5.         “Vous faites un travail fantastique ici !!! Congratulations pour tout ce que vous apportez à la Terre, notre belle planète que nous partageons tous. Continuez, n’abandonnez jamais, et sachez qu’il y a beaucoup de  personnes travaillant avec vous à travers le monde !!! "" – Thomas (France)6.         ""Thanks for letting me into your beautiful project and people. It is very inspiring to find people fighting for similar goals far away from home and under different environments. Thanks for being seeds for change! – Daniel (Denmark)7.         ""Saya sangat menyukai kegiatan membudidayakan tanaman organic yg alami. Sehat dan bebas kimia. Sehingga dapat dikonsumsi dengan aman dan membuat tubuh kita terbebas dari sat yang dapat membuat masalah dalam tubuh kita.

OTRAS MANERAS DE COLABORAR- COMPARTI nuestra campaña con tus amigos!- VENI a visitar nuestro proyecto. - APOYA a los agricultores locales y los movimientos de transición en tu propia comunidad.- LEE algunos de nuestros libros favoritos (y sugerinos los tuyos):¿Quién realmente alimenta el mundo? (Vandana Shiva), Drawdown (Paul Hawken), One Straw Revolution (Masanobu Fukouka), El valor de la nada (Raj Patel), Permacultura: Principios y caminos más allá de la sostenibilidad (David Holmgren), Esto lo cambia todo (Naomi Klein), Dark Emu (Bruce Pascoe), Economía Sagrada (Charles Eisenstein), El Tao de la Física (Fritjof Capra), El Arte de la Comida Simple (Alice Waters).Si podés donar, ¡GRACIAS! Tu ayuda es un paso gigante para nosotros. Cada gesto individual importa: es la acumulación de pequeñas acciones las que son la base para cambiar el mundo.GRACIAS POR EL APOYO  -----------VERSI BAHASA INDONESIA------------- 1. TUJUAN KAMITujuan pertama kami adalah menciptakan ruang asrama tempat relawan lokal, tamu internasional, dan peserta lokakarya dapat tinggal dan belajar permaculture bersama kami. Asrama dan tempat kami juga akan siap digunakan sebagai titik evakuasi, dapur umum dan / atau zona aman untuk bencana alam di masa depan (sejak September tahun lalu, Emas Hitam telah terlibat dalam upaya bantuan Agung Agung untuk letusan Gunung Agung, dan baru-baru ini gempa bumi di Lombok melalui sukarelawan, penyortiran sumbangan dan dukungan logistik).Berikut ini adalah tonggak pendanaan kami:• $ 5000: Asrama Akomodasi (pondasi, struktur, tempat tidur susun, perlengkapan interior, atap, dan balkon)• + $ 1000: Dapur bersama (pondasi, struktur, dapur tradisional Bali, oven alami, kompor roket, sistem greywater, filter air, pipa ledeng, wastafel, persediaan memasak)• + $ 500: Sistem penyimpanan air hujan (platform, tangki air hujan, casing bambu, pipa, keran, filter mesh)• +1000: Kamar mandi bersama (pondasi, atap, struktur, toilet kompos kering, pancuran matahari, sistem greywater)• + $ 2500: Bungalow keluarga dengan kamar mandi terpisah (pondasi, struktur, tempat tidur, perlengkapan interior, atap, balkon, toilet kompos kering, area shower)Jika kami mencapai lebih dari $ 10.000, kami akan mengusulkan fasilitas lain - dipilih oleh komunitas donor kami, seperti ruang hidup bersama atau transportasi untuk mengumpulkan limbah desa!2. KAMI ‘MENGAPA’Kenapa tidak?Karena kita bisa, karena kita harus, karena kita mau! Kami memahami bahwa sistem lama sedang sekarat, serta cara lama dalam melakukan sesuatu. Kami tahu bagaimana menemukan solusi regeneratif berdasarkan kolaborasi yang terikat oleh etika dan prinsip permakultur. Kami ingin merancang Ancut Garden Oasis (AGO) sebagai sistem keseluruhan, di mana setiap elemen dan manusia dapat mencapai tujuan tertinggi mereka - saling mempercayai satu sama lain, dan menciptakan kehidupan komunitas yang dapat menjadi contoh bagi orang lain.3. SIAPA KAMIKami adalah sekelompok teman yang berbagi visi yang sama tentang bagaimana kami ingin menjalani hidup kami. Kami semua berasal dari latar belakang yang berbeda dan telah memiliki kehidupan yang sukses sejauh ini, namun masing-masing merasa bahwa ada sesuatu yang hilang. Kami menemukannya ketika kami terhubung dengan tanah. Bekerja bersama, kami menyadari dampak yang dapat kami miliki dengan mengajari orang cara menanam makanan mereka sendiri dan meregenerasi tanah mereka. Bersama dengan komunitas lokal, kami menciptakan Ancut Garden Oasis. Kami percaya kami dapat memiliki dampak positif di dunia kita, dengan merawat orang, Planet kita dan dengan redistribusi yang adil dari surplus kita. Kami ingin menjadi bagian dari sesuatu yang lebih besar dari diri kami sendiri, dan kami tahu bahwa kami tidak dapat melakukannya sendirian.4. CERITA KAMISetelah Kadek lulus dari Universitas Navdanya Vandana Shiva pada tahun 2015, Kadek dan Feny terinspirasi untuk ikut mendirikan Emas Hitam Indonesia (EHI) dengan dukungan pemuda Indonesia lainnya pada bulan Desember 2015.Sejak saat ini, tim telah secara aktif berkontribusi terhadap kedaulatan pangan dan gerakan keberlanjutan di Bali dan di seluruh Indonesia. Pelatihan kami meliputi:• Sekaroh, Lombok Timur (Juni-Juli 2016): EHI melatih sekelompok petani 32 orang ,mereka berjuang untuk menumbuhkan satu tanaman jagung hybrida setiap tahun, dengan  mengajarkan  mereka bagaimana meregenerasi tanah mereka menerapkan prinsip-prinsip desain permaculture. Sehingga mereka bisa menanam lebih banyak berbagai jenis tanaman yang mereka butuhkan.• Karangasem, Bali Timur (Nov 2017): Tim EHI menyampaikan lokakarya yang disesuaikan untuk 3 desa tentang fiksasi nitrogen, penggunaan rumput vetiver sebagai pencegahan erosi, dan cara menciptakan bisnis berkelanjutan yang tumbuh dari moringa oleifera.• Malaka, Io Kufeu, Timor Barat (Agustus 2017): Pelatihan EHI memperkenalkan konsep pertanian regeneratif ke 3 komunitas yang berhubungan dengan praktek pertanian yang tidak berkelanjutan.Pada bulan November 2017, kami turut menciptakan Festival JAGA Indonesia: Merayakan Agroekologi dan Kemerdekaan Benih - acara gratis bagi lebih dari 250 petani Indonesia, pelajar, perwakilan pemerintah dan aktivis di Bali dan Jawa. Guru Navdanya University Kadek datang terutama dari India untuk berbagi lokakarya praktis mereka tentang agroekologi, kedaulatan pangan, kompos cair, dan penyimpanan benih.Selain itu, kami telah terlibat dalam pelatihan, konsultasi dan keterlibatan berbicara termasuk Ubud Food Festival, acara Slow Food Bali, Pengenalan Kursus Permakultur IDEP, dan lokakarya mahasiswa Hari Bumi Universitas Udayana.5. SITUS KAMISejak Desember 2017, kami telah beroperasi di Ancut Garden, situs baru kami di Petulu, yang 100% bebas pestisida, bebas pupuk kimia dan non-GMO. Dalam bahasa Bali, ‘ancut’ (diucapkan ‘pinggir’), berarti ‘batas’ atau ‘sisi’. Ini adalah tempat di mana dua realitas bertemu-hidup seperti yang kita kenal dan kehidupan yang ingin kita jalani! Sejak pindah ke sini, kami telah membangun:Gambar: Situs, sebelum-sesudah, lalu peta• Rumah Kayu Kejutan 2 tingkat kami dengan toilet kompos kering• Kebun bibit dan peternakan cacing• Area kompos panas (4x kompos teluk, kiln biochar, mesin pemotong ranting dan pemotong daun)• Desain taman (3x sawah, kebun dapur, tempat bedengan mandala yang ditinggikan, 3x lingkaran pisang, 2x kolam, 10x biopori)• Hutan makanan (pohon buah-buahan dan tanaman umbi termasuk kelor, pisang, talas, ubi jalar, singkong, nangka, durian, rambutan, salak, mangga putih, pepaya, tebu, kelapa, vanila, merica dan banyak lagi!)• Sistem pengelolaan limbah• Akses dan parkir• DALAM KEMAJUAN: ruang belajar komunitas, toilet kompos ke-2, rumah bambu AGO",42.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>UPDATE 4/8:</strong></h3>
<div>We have been busy! Since the time we started this campaign we have run two community planting days with 20-25 volunteers/residents participating in each to pilot our program. In these pilot plantings we ran two educational tree care workshops and have planted over 30 fruit trees and learned a lot about the logistics of running this program. We have also secured a site to start a small nursery for future tree propagation in East Oakland at Castlemont High School. We have started developing plans for future plantings including planting with several houses of a residential drug recovery program in Oakland and Berkeley, and a school teacher and her urban agriculture group in their neighborhood in Fruitvale. We now have two incredibly knowledable teachers, Justin Valone and Anders Vidstrand on board to teach our tree care workshops. And we recently received a generous $5,000 grant from the Rose Foundation!</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Quotes from people who participated in our program so far:</div>
<div>""It really works. I met many neighbors - people I have never talked to before, though I lived on this block for 4 years."" - North Oakland tree steward</div>
<div> </div>
<div>""Thank you for the trees, food, fertilizer and great instruction.""</div>
<div>- North Oakland tree steward</div>
<div> </div>
<div>""Incredible class! I learned so much""</div>
<div>- Volunteer at the Fruitvale planting</div>
<div> </div>
<div>""We noticed how people have been littering significantly less since we facilitated the sweet planting on our block."" - Fruitvale resident and tree steward </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are excited to have such an adaptable program where we can work with schools, hospitals, centers and other organizations that serve the community. We are so grateful for all your support!</div>

<h3>
<strong>What:</strong> <strong>Helping Oakland residents plant and steward fruit trees for their communities.</strong>
</h3>
<p><span>Growing Together's mission is to connect people to nature and each other, building resilient communities through food, urban agriculture, and education. </span>We facilitate neighbors joining together to plant community owned trees in the front and back yards of homes in the SF East Bay. We aim to plant in underserved neighborhoods that are experiencing a convergence of health, economic and environmental crises, with the understanding that urban trees provide innumerable community and environmental benefits. We provide the fruit trees and basic tree care education and help with planting and long term maintenance. The residents care for the trees and share the fruit.   </p>
<h3><strong>Why?:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Food Justice<span> </span>: To build long term food security in Oakland</li>
<li>Community: To meet our neighbors and share the harvest</li>
<li>Education: To increase local knowledge and share skills for fruit tree cultivation</li>
<li>Environment: To green and beautify our neighborhoods</li>
</ul><p>It is <a href=""http://persquaremile.com/2012/05/24/income-inequality-seen-from-space/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">evident</a> that low income urban areas substantially lack the tree cover found in more affluent neighborhoods. What is less immediately evident, is the vast health and environmental implications of living in a ""concrete jungle"". Studies have shown that the presence of trees helps reduce stress, speed healing time, and even decrease rates of domestic violence and child abuse. Furthermore, many residents of urban areas experience a myriad of health problems associated with living in food deserts (areas with out access to healthy food) including diabetes, obesity and other chronic health conditions. Trees clean the air of pollutants, create oxygen, and absorb CO2,  lower heating and cooling costs of nearby buildings, reduce water run-off, increase property values, provide essential habitat for many species and more.  As these are fruit trees they will also provide a source of local fresh fruit for decades and centuries to come.</p>
<p>For all these benefits and more, we believe in the power of planting trees to serve the most vulnerable communities and populations that bear the brunt of environmental burdens.</p>
<p>(For a more complete list of tree benefits and a list of sources see our website <a href=""http://www.growingtogetherproject.org/#!benefits-of-urban-trees/c1oui"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">growingtogetherproject.org</a>)</p>
<h3><strong>How It Works:</strong></h3>
<p><span><strong>1 </strong></span><span><strong>→</strong></span><span><strong>  Any int</strong></span><strong>erested resident of Oakland contacts us about becoming a fruit tree steward.</strong></p>
<p>Great! We would love to help you plant a fruit tree in your yard.  First we work with this future fruit steward to organize their community. We help that person connect with neighbors and find other fruit tree stewards with planting sites on their street. We aim to plant trees in clusters of 20 or more per block for optimal impact and to promote community building, and grow an abundant shareable harvest. <a href=""http://www.growingtogetherproject.org/#!become-a-fruit-tree-steward/c18kq"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Interested?</a></p>
<p><strong>2 </strong><span><strong>→</strong></span><strong> Together we organize a tree planting day for the block during which Growing Together volunteers and neighborhood members get together to plant donated trees at the selected sites </strong><span>(the front/back yards of the stewards)</span><strong> for community use.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3 </strong><span><strong>→</strong></span><strong> Tree stewards water and care for the trees as they grow.</strong></p>
<p>Tree stewards attend an educational workshop during the planting day to learn about tree water needs, pruning, and other tree care topics prior to planting. After planting, we can also help with questions, and provide any expert care the tree needs.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong><span><strong>→</strong></span><strong> When fruit is ready, the neighborhood shares the harvest.</strong><br/> An abundant fruit tree is for sharing.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Goal:</strong> To plant 1,000 fruit trees at Oakland homes, gardens, and community centers in the next 16 months!</h3>
<p><span><span>Our goal is to plant 1,000 fruit trees in people's yards, community centers and schools by May 2014. Accordingly, we will teach between 40-50 tree care workshops and hold 40-50 community planting days with 15-25 households participating in each. We will not hold plantings during the dry summer season and will use that time to focus on signing up more tree stewards and working on propagation. After our first planting cycle, we will evaluate the project and decide on our goal for the next year and how to proceed.</span></span></p>
<p><span>The money raised here will allow us to purchase trees in bulk, tra</span>nsport trees, purchase and propagate groundcovers and perennials to complement our tree plantings, provide soil amendments and staking materials, produce and print flyers and promotional materials, provide educational materials for stewards, host community planting days and cover the costs to coordinate this project.</p>
<h3>Our Model</h3>
<p><span>Growing Together is unique in its approach of planting fruit trees on community members' private land for community use and in our focus on planting in neighborhoods of need. As far as we are aware, we are developing a new model, in working with private homeowners to re-green communities, one street at a time. Therefore, the success of this project will not only benefit Oakland residents, but also create a replicable model so that others can implement similar projects in their own communities.</span></p>
<p><strong>If you like this project, please contribute as you are able and share our website and campaign with your friends. And if you live locally, please consider becoming a GT fruit tree steward as well and help us coordinate a planting on your block!  Thank you so much for your support!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Who we are:</strong></h3>
<p>Mallika is a gardener, yogi, healthy food enthusiast and food justice activist.  She asked herself how she could best serve the world and her local community, and planting fruit trees all over the city seemed like the most worthy thing she could do; from that impulse, this project was born. </p>

UPDATE 4/8:
We have been busy! Since the time we started this campaign we have run two community planting days with 20-25 volunteers/residents participating in each to pilot our program. In these pilot plantings we ran two educational tree care workshops and have planted over 30 fruit trees and learned a lot about the logistics of running this program. We have also secured a site to start a small nursery for future tree propagation in East Oakland at Castlemont High School. We have started developing plans for future plantings including planting with several houses of a residential drug recovery program in Oakland and Berkeley, and a school teacher and her urban agriculture group in their neighborhood in Fruitvale. We now have two incredibly knowledable teachers, Justin Valone and Anders Vidstrand on board to teach our tree care workshops. And we recently received a generous $5,000 grant from the Rose Foundation!
 
 
Quotes from people who participated in our program so far:
""It really works. I met many neighbors - people I have never talked to before, though I lived on this block for 4 years."" - North Oakland tree steward
 
""Thank you for the trees, food, fertilizer and great instruction.""
- North Oakland tree steward
 
""Incredible class! I learned so much""
- Volunteer at the Fruitvale planting
 
""We noticed how people have been littering significantly less since we facilitated the sweet planting on our block."" - Fruitvale resident and tree steward 
 
We are excited to have such an adaptable program where we can work with schools, hospitals, centers and other organizations that serve the community. We are so grateful for all your support!
 
Please continue to support us to do this important work!

What: Helping Oakland residents plant and steward fruit trees for their communities.

Growing Together's mission is to connect people to nature and each other, building resilient communities through food, urban agriculture, and education. We facilitate neighbors joining together to plant community owned trees in the front and back yards of homes in the SF East Bay. We aim to plant in underserved neighborhoods that are experiencing a convergence of health, economic and environmental crises, with the understanding that urban trees provide innumerable community and environmental benefits. We provide the fruit trees and basic tree care education and help with planting and long term maintenance. The residents care for the trees and share the fruit.   
Why?:

Food Justice : To build long term food security in Oakland
Community: To meet our neighbors and share the harvest
Education: To increase local knowledge and share skills for fruit tree cultivation
Environment: To green and beautify our neighborhoods
It is evident that low income urban areas substantially lack the tree cover found in more affluent neighborhoods. What is less immediately evident, is the vast health and environmental implications of living in a ""concrete jungle"". Studies have shown that the presence of trees helps reduce stress, speed healing time, and even decrease rates of domestic violence and child abuse. Furthermore, many residents of urban areas experience a myriad of health problems associated with living in food deserts (areas with out access to healthy food) including diabetes, obesity and other chronic health conditions. Trees clean the air of pollutants, create oxygen, and absorb CO2,  lower heating and cooling costs of nearby buildings, reduce water run-off, increase property values, provide essential habitat for many species and more.  As these are fruit trees they will also provide a source of local fresh fruit for decades and centuries to come.
For all these benefits and more, we believe in the power of planting trees to serve the most vulnerable communities and populations that bear the brunt of environmental burdens.
(For a more complete list of tree benefits and a list of sources see our website growingtogetherproject.org)
How It Works:
1 →  Any interested resident of Oakland contacts us about becoming a fruit tree steward.
Great! We would love to help you plant a fruit tree in your yard.  First we work with this future fruit steward to organize their community. We help that person connect with neighbors and find other fruit tree stewards with planting sites on their street. We aim to plant trees in clusters of 20 or more per block for optimal impact and to promote community building, and grow an abundant shareable harvest. Interested?
2 → Together we organize a tree planting day for the block during which Growing Together volunteers and neighborhood members get together to plant donated trees at the selected sites (the front/back yards of the stewards) for community use.
3 → Tree stewards water and care for the trees as they grow.
Tree stewards attend an educational workshop during the planting day to learn about tree water needs, pruning, and other tree care topics prior to planting. After planting, we can also help with questions, and provide any expert care the tree needs.
4 → When fruit is ready, the neighborhood shares the harvest. An abundant fruit tree is for sharing.

Goal: To plant 1,000 fruit trees at Oakland homes, gardens, and community centers in the next 16 months!
Our goal is to plant 1,000 fruit trees in people's yards, community centers and schools by May 2014. Accordingly, we will teach between 40-50 tree care workshops and hold 40-50 community planting days with 15-25 households participating in each. We will not hold plantings during the dry summer season and will use that time to focus on signing up more tree stewards and working on propagation. After our first planting cycle, we will evaluate the project and decide on our goal for the next year and how to proceed.
The money raised here will allow us to purchase trees in bulk, transport trees, purchase and propagate groundcovers and perennials to complement our tree plantings, provide soil amendments and staking materials, produce and print flyers and promotional materials, provide educational materials for stewards, host community planting days and cover the costs to coordinate this project.
Our Model
Growing Together is unique in its approach of planting fruit trees on community members' private land for community use and in our focus on planting in neighborhoods of need. As far as we are aware, we are developing a new model, in working with private homeowners to re-green communities, one street at a time. Therefore, the success of this project will not only benefit Oakland residents, but also create a replicable model so that others can implement similar projects in their own communities.
If you like this project, please contribute as you are able and share our website and campaign with your friends. And if you live locally, please consider becoming a GT fruit tree steward as well and help us coordinate a planting on your block!  Thank you so much for your support!
Who we are:
Mallika is a gardener, yogi, healthy food enthusiast and food justice activist.  She asked herself how she could best serve the world and her local community, and planting fruit trees all over the city seemed like the most worthy thing she could do; from that impulse, this project was born.

<b>ask for natural perfumes.</b></p>
<p><b>ENVIRONMENT                                          </b></p>

chemical industry took over the production of perfumes there are <b>no more flower fields and then </b><b>no habitats for

<p style=""font-style: normal;"">The International Perfume Foundation has formally requested the EU to have Perfume TAKEN OUT of the Cosmetic Directive because PERFUME IS NOT A COSMETIC and that Perfume needs its own regulation and guidelines. </p>
<p style=""font-style: normal;""></p>
<p>With the support of several countries, we are asking UNESCO to recognise ""Perfume as a World Heritage"" and classify Perfume within the foundation of UNESCO World Heritage. This initiative will preserve and protect the Art of Perfumery, national  knowledges and national plant heritage. Many countries have beautiful flowers , resins, precious woods, and  healing plants they cannot use anymore because synthetic reproduction are made by the chemical industry and commercialised under the same name.

DONATE TO OUR CAMPAIGN. </b></p>Perfume has been in use since the beginning of the ages by all civilisations. Perfume used to be known as the ""soul"" of flowers. In the beginning perfume was so precious, it was only used by men as a gift to their gods, then it was used as a medicinal healing art before becoming part of fashion and lifestyle.<br/><p></p>
<p style=""font-style: normal;"">The beneficial power of flowers as
well as the importance of our well being, health and the sense of smell have
been completely compromised and overlooked by our regulators. It is proposed they are being supported by the chemical
industry due to lobbying efforts and financial contributions to accept ""their"" new molecules and synthetics with less data and knowledge than our very old
pharmacopeia. </p>
<p style=""font-style: normal;"">Today a great many of the best Perfumers have left Europe
as they can find it extremely difficult to use naturals anymore. The European Union (EU) regulations
and regulators have sided mainly with the synthetic and chemical industry. </p>
<p style=""font-style: normal;"">Today there are concerns in the natural perfumery community that the EU Commission through such industry lobbying, is trying to impose it's
unreasonable and inappropriate regulations worldwide. Such a movement or result
would put not only the World Perfume Heritage in danger but also Our World Food Program and the future of our children.  Scent free policies are already in place in several part of the world as more and more people are allergic to synthetic perfumes. </p>

<p>The action, initiative and movement YOU CAN CREATE TODAY are very important in preserving the Heritage of Perfume and the Art of Perfumery. They will also encourage and replenish our global floral and natural aromatics farms and distillation industries.  We need to replant flowers worldwide to give the natural, sustainable environment back to bees, and pollinators their habitat.</p>
<p>This action, initiative and movement will also create and GIVE WORK TO MILLION PEOPLE worldwide who will be allowed to cultivate the flower fields for the natural perfumers who will use flowers and naturals in the traditional ways based on their original and historical perfume compositions and formulations.  The International Perfume Foundation is supporting the Perfumery Art School for their worldwide traditional perfumery curriculum. </p>

<p style=""font-style: normal;""><b>BACKGROUND</b><span style=""font-style: italic; letter-spacing: 0px;"">                 </span></p>
<p>The International Perfume Foundation was founded in January 1995, by Creezy Courtoy, after realising that the art of creating and making real perfumes was in danger of disappearing.</p>
<p>Perfume is not only an important industry but also apart of our global heritage and cultural history.  While advocating for almost 20 years to the industry that chemicals could be hazardous if not tested in the right way, Creezy Courtoy collected perfume art pieces to show that perfume was not only an industry but also <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">an important link in the World Perfume Heritage and Culture.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p>The Perfume Foundation is a Belgian non-profit organisation created in 1995, known internationally and recognised by institutions, the perfume and cosmetic industry and NGO’s.</p>
<p>The Perfume Foundation is a consumer organisation totally independent from the perfume industry. The Perfume Foundation’s mission is to be the leading authority on environmental and health issues related to fragrances and scents, while contributing to the cultural heritage of perfume.<br/></p>
<p>The name “Perfume Foundation” is a reference to its ultimate goal to come back to the basic foundation of Perfumery, which are products that are good for health, safe for the environment and made with real flowers and plants.  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/648721/files/20140614071318-__real_perfume__.jpg?1402755198"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1999, the International Perfume Foundation organized an exhibition at UNESCO called LES ROUTES DU PARFUM to illustrate the World Perfume Heritage and as a result the International Perfume Foundation received UNESCO High Patronage Designation and Recognition.</p>

It will go on on our website www.perfumefoundation.org until we succeed to raise enough funding to accomplish our mission


               Version Française





               

                   

SHORT SUMMARY
TODAY, CONSUMERS, ENVIRONMENT AND OUR CHILDREN'S HERITAGE  ARE IN DANGER
WE NEED YOU TO BE PART OF THIS AND TO ACT NOW
The Mission of the International PERFUME FOUNDATION is the Preservation of Consumer Health while protecting the World Perfume Heritage.  Preserving the Perfume Heritage is also Protecting the Environment and Preserving Your Art of Living

PERFUMES  
The Perfumes
you find in the stores contain no more flowers but mostly unknown chemicals. New
regulations made in favour of the chemical industry are making the use of naturals impossible for the last perfumers
defending natural perfumery.
CONSUMERS                                              
Consumer organisations are pointing health issues regarding synthetic perfumes and encourage their government to put in
place scent free policies. On the other hand, consumers love perfumes and
ask for natural perfumes.
ENVIRONMENT                                          
As the
chemical industry took over the production of perfumes there are no more flower fields and then no habitats for
bees and pollinators.
CHILDREN’S Future                        
Without bees and pollinators, our future generations will know a severe lack of food.
Incense, Oud, Attar…
Perfume is part of the culture
of many countries in the world. If perfume is forbidden in public places it will
be also forbidden in religious
cult places. 


                  WE CAN CHANGE THE FUTURE  


         AND YOU CAN BE PART OF THE CHANGE 

IF WE ACT NOW WE CAN PROTECT THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN AND THE NEXT GENERATIONS
WITH YOUR PARTICIPATION WE CAN
-Replant Flower Fields Worldwide

-Give Work to Millions of People around the World 
-Bring Back the Bees and Pollinators their Habitats

-Have Perfumers to Reintroduce Flowers back in   your Perfumes to make them 
            

DONATE FOR THIS CAUSE AND HAVE YOUR NAME FOREVER KNOWN AS PART OF THE PERFUME HISTORY 


WHAT WE NEED
Today we need to raise an additional 250.000 Euro.
Your donations and support will allow us to put in place our
campaign at a global level.
With your help, we will finance the organisation of the exhibition, the conference and the event at UNESCO
Paris, in order to Classify Perfume in the Unesco World Heritage    
With your support, we will put in place the World Perfume Development Program, our Perfumotherapy DNA research centres and the first flower fields. 
With your support we will educate children, our future generation the importance of ""bees"" without the bees our food supply will be severely affected.

                           WORLD PERFUME HERITAGE 
The International Perfume Foundation has formally requested the EU to have Perfume TAKEN OUT of the Cosmetic Directive because PERFUME IS NOT A COSMETIC and that Perfume needs its own regulation and guidelines. 

With the support of several countries, we are asking UNESCO to recognise ""Perfume as a World Heritage"" and classify Perfume within the foundation of UNESCO World Heritage. This initiative will preserve and protect the Art of Perfumery, national  knowledges and national plant heritage. Many countries have beautiful flowers , resins, precious woods, and  healing plants they cannot use anymore because synthetic reproduction are made by the chemical industry and commercialised under the same name. This is a lack of respect for small producers and misleading communication for consumer who believe he is buying   
                   


Perfume
is an art of living, used by all countries and all civilisations.


Perfume is an Art Form, like Painting, Music or Dance.


If you are like us, you love the world of perfume and understand the beneficial power of plants, especially flowers, SHOW YOU EXIST AND WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. DONATE TO OUR CAMPAIGN. Perfume has been in use since the beginning of the ages by all civilisations. Perfume used to be known as the ""soul"" of flowers. In the beginning perfume was so precious, it was only used by men as a gift to their gods, then it was used as a medicinal healing art before becoming part of fashion and lifestyle.
The beneficial power of flowers as
well as the importance of our well being, health and the sense of smell have
been completely compromised and overlooked by our regulators. It is proposed they are being supported by the chemical
industry due to lobbying efforts and financial contributions to accept ""their"" new molecules and synthetics with less data and knowledge than our very old
pharmacopeia. 
Today a great many of the best Perfumers have left Europe
as they can find it extremely difficult to use naturals anymore. The European Union (EU) regulations
and regulators have sided mainly with the synthetic and chemical industry. 
Today there are concerns in the natural perfumery community that the EU Commission through such industry lobbying, is trying to impose it's
unreasonable and inappropriate regulations worldwide. Such a movement or result
would put not only the World Perfume Heritage in danger but also Our World Food Program and the future of our children.  Scent free policies are already in place in several part of the world as more and more people are allergic to synthetic perfumes. 


THE IMPACT


The action, initiative and movement YOU CAN CREATE TODAY are very important in preserving the Heritage of Perfume and the Art of Perfumery. They will also encourage and replenish our global floral and natural aromatics farms and distillation industries.  We need to replant flowers worldwide to give the natural, sustainable environment back to bees, and pollinators their habitat.
This action, initiative and movement will also create and GIVE WORK TO MILLION PEOPLE worldwide who will be allowed to cultivate the flower fields for the natural perfumers who will use flowers and naturals in the traditional ways based on their original and historical perfume compositions and formulations.  The International Perfume Foundation is supporting the Perfumery Art School for their worldwide traditional perfumery curriculum.

BACKGROUND                 
The International Perfume Foundation was founded in January 1995, by Creezy Courtoy, after realising that the art of creating and making real perfumes was in danger of disappearing.
Perfume is not only an important industry but also apart of our global heritage and cultural history.  While advocating for almost 20 years to the industry that chemicals could be hazardous if not tested in the right way, Creezy Courtoy collected perfume art pieces to show that perfume was not only an industry but also an important link in the World Perfume Heritage and Culture.

The Perfume Foundation is a Belgian non-profit organisation created in 1995, known internationally and recognised by institutions, the perfume and cosmetic industry and NGO’s.
The Perfume Foundation is a consumer organisation totally independent from the perfume industry. The Perfume Foundation’s mission is to be the leading authority on environmental and health issues related to fragrances and scents, while contributing to the cultural heritage of perfume.
The name “Perfume Foundation” is a reference to its ultimate goal to come back to the basic foundation of Perfumery, which are products that are good for health, safe for the environment and made with real flowers and plants.  

In 1999, the International Perfume Foundation organized an exhibition at UNESCO called LES ROUTES DU PARFUM to illustrate the World Perfume Heritage and as a result the International Perfume Foundation received UNESCO High Patronage Designation and Recognition.

Will you help Verónica get to Lima?



What We Need & What You Get
 We need to raise the funds for Verónica's travel to Lima.  2500 euros is the cost for Verónica to travel to Lima, stay in budget accommodation, get to the Conference each day (and eat).

If we don't reach our target any funds that you donate will still help cover the cost of getting Verónica to Lima. 

If we exceed our target, the additional funds will go towards continuing the Global Greens climate campaign into next year: pulling together a global analysis of Green climate policies, producing campaign materials, pressuring governments and more.
We've got great gifts to thank you for your generosity: a DVD of the inspiring first Global Greens Congress (guaranteed to make you cry), a (signed!) book of speeches from the Congress, personal shout-outs from Lima and more.

<h4>What Is Uncle Dave's Organic Botanical Soil Activator?</h4>
<p>The primary ingredients in our Botanical Soil Activator are a proprietary blend of plant extracts from succulent plants native to the deserts of the South-Western US and Northern Mexico.  All ingredients are plant based and 100% organic.</p><h4>When will you ship product to supporters?</h4><p>We have already run a small production batch for test garden use. Our full production efforts will begin shortly after our campaign ends...likely September or early October. We expect to begin shipping in November 2014.<br/></p><br/><h4>What makes it work?</h4>
<p>All soil contains active bacteria (micro-organisms).  In fact just a handful of healthy soil contains ten’s of millions of these tiny micro-organisms.  A plant’s ability to thrive is directly related to the presence of this living population.  These micro-organisms convert nutrients in the soil into plant-available form.  Without a healthy micro-organism population in the soil, many of the nutrients remain unused by the plants and can be washed away with heavy watering or heavy rains…which is what creates toxic runoff.</p>
<p>Our Botanical Soil Activator feeds, stimulates the growth, and increases the population of the micro-organisms in your soil.  This improves the quality of your soil and helps your plants develop a more advanced root system that can more efficiently consume soil nutrients.  Healthier roots with a more advanced root structure consume water and nutrients more efficiently which reduces the amount of nutrients we need to add to our soils. It also increases the vibrancy and yields of your plants.<br/></p><br/><h4>Is Uncle Dave’s Organic botanical soil activator safe?</h4>
<p>YES!  Our botanical soil activator is 100% organic. It contains no pesticides, no animal waste and no man-made chemicals of any kind.  It is 100% water-soluble and is completely non-hazardous and non-toxic.  No special protection is required for use, and no first aid is required if it comes in contact with your skin.  <b>It is completely safe to use around your kids and pets!</b></p><br/><h4>What Can I expect for results?</h4>
<p>Your lawn will become greener, your plants will become healthier, and you will get bigger yields from your fruit and vegetable garden.  If you are growing your own food, that means bigger healthier fruits and veggies. Yum!</p><p>You can use less water and fertilizer!  <br/></p><p>AND Uncle Dave’s Organic - Botanical Soil Activator contains saponins (plant based surfactants with antifungal and antibacterial properties) that will also help your plants resist  disease and pests.</p><br/><h4>What Can Uncle Dave’s be used on?</h4>
<p><b>Uncle Dave’s Organic Botanical Soil Activator</b> can be used on any soil types and with anything you grow, including: lawns, house plants, fruit or nut trees, shrubs, flowers, vines, vegetables, berries, melons, and root or bulb crops.</p><br/><h4>When Should I apply it?</h4>
<p></p><ul>
<li>For lawns, you can apply anytime using a hose-end sprayer.  For best results, we suggest monthly applications.  If you want better results… use more often.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>For existing shrubs, trees and plants, we recommend applying monthly.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>For seedlings and new gardens, we recommend applications at planting.  After planting we suggest applications once every 7-14 days.</li>

PLEASE DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS CAMPAIGN!  
Hey, it’s Uncle Dave and I know it may see a bit crazy to ask you NOT to contribute to my campaign… but let me tell you why.

Being in compliance with all state and local regulations is important to the long term success of not only this product, but my company as well.

About a week ago, I was contacted by the agriculture division of one of the states I want to ship my product to and informed that I need to register my product with their state.  

This process is lengthy and does carry a cost that I was not anticipating.  Similar registration will likely apply to all 50 states.  So, I have a little work to do!

For those of you who have already contributed to the campaign, I will personally refund your money for now… and I’ll contact you when we’re ready to come back to indiegogo.

Thanks for believing in this product… I will be back!

Keep Growing,
Uncle Dave

They may seem like small choices but they shape the course of our lives… and the lives of our families, our communities and our planet as a whole.Let’s work together to create a better world for ourselves and future generations.Uncle Dave’s Organics - Botanical Soil Activator contains no artificial chemicals or preservatives.  It is completely non-toxic and safe to use around kids and pets.One 6 oz. bottle can be diluted with 30 gallons of water to drench the soil around your shrubs, plants and trees.  OR when applied with a hose-end sprayer, it can cover up to 1000 square feet of your yard or garden.Remember, it works by increasing the activity of the micro-organisms in the soil, allowing your plants to more effectively use water and nutrients.  This not only helps the soil grow healthier plants but it also reduces the amount of water and fertilizer you need to use.  That means less harmful environmental run-off.So, now you know that by using Uncle Dave’s, not only are your plants healthier and happier... but you're also helping to decrease water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming.Here are some other ways you can help


Get our branded tote!  Everyone has stuff they need to tote around, like: books, groceries, or fruits and veggies from the local farmers market.  Do it in STYLE!


Get a campaign perk as a gift for your garden-loving, organic-minded, planet-saving friends... they'll thank you for it :)


Tell your friends and family.  This one is HUGE!  We need your help spreading the word about Uncle Dave's Organic Soil Activator!  There are lots of yards, gardens, farms, trees, and plants that need healthier soil... even if they're not yours.  Make some happy dirt!


Share our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, g+, reddit, Tumblr, etc.  Again, your friends can help, too!  



About Uncle Dave's OrganicsUncle Dave’s Organics is a company on a mission!  We want to help make it simple to live a healthy life while creating a healthier world.  By sharing our research and our passion for living green… we’re committed to providing the inspiration and the products to make that possible.We believe that there is a fundamental essence in each of us to grow.  And for most of us it’s not only about growing ourselves and realizing our own potential... it's about growing something else... a family, a business, a garden, a gift for tomorrow!


We Support:  At Uncle Dave's Organics we share the idea that business is about selling things that change lives and that business profits can help change the world. With that in mind we've chosen to divide 5% of our Net Profits from this campaign between the following two organizations. We chose these two organizations because they represent effective application of donation dollars and both have initiatives that will help reduce the harmful effects of current agricultural practices.By supporting our campaign you're helping too!
What Is Uncle Dave's Organic Botanical Soil Activator?
The primary ingredients in our Botanical Soil Activator are a proprietary blend of plant extracts from succulent plants native to the deserts of the South-Western US and Northern Mexico.  All ingredients are plant based and 100% organic.When will you ship product to supporters?We have already run a small production batch for test garden use. Our full production efforts will begin shortly after our campaign ends...likely September or early October. We expect to begin shipping in November 2014.What makes it work?
All soil contains active bacteria (micro-organisms).  In fact just a handful of healthy soil contains ten’s of millions of these tiny micro-organisms.  A plant’s ability to thrive is directly related to the presence of this living population.  These micro-organisms convert nutrients in the soil into plant-available form.  Without a healthy micro-organism population in the soil, many of the nutrients remain unused by the plants and can be washed away with heavy watering or heavy rains…which is what creates toxic runoff.
Our Botanical Soil Activator feeds, stimulates the growth, and increases the population of the micro-organisms in your soil.  This improves the quality of your soil and helps your plants develop a more advanced root system that can more efficiently consume soil nutrients.  Healthier roots with a more advanced root structure consume water and nutrients more efficiently which reduces the amount of nutrients we need to add to our soils. It also increases the vibrancy and yields of your plants.Is Uncle Dave’s Organic botanical soil activator safe?
YES!  Our botanical soil activator is 100% organic. It contains no pesticides, no animal waste and no man-made chemicals of any kind.  It is 100% water-soluble and is completely non-hazardous and non-toxic.  No special protection is required for use, and no first aid is required if it comes in contact with your skin.  It is completely safe to use around your kids and pets!What Can I expect for results?
Your lawn will become greener, your plants will become healthier, and you will get bigger yields from your fruit and vegetable garden.  If you are growing your own food, that means bigger healthier fruits and veggies. Yum!You can use less water and fertilizer!  AND Uncle Dave’s Organic - Botanical Soil Activator contains saponins (plant based surfactants with antifungal and antibacterial properties) that will also help your plants resist  disease and pests.What Can Uncle Dave’s be used on?
Uncle Dave’s Organic Botanical Soil Activator can be used on any soil types and with anything you grow, including: lawns, house plants, fruit or nut trees, shrubs, flowers, vines, vegetables, berries, melons, and root or bulb crops.When Should I apply it?

For lawns, you can apply anytime using a hose-end sprayer.  For best results, we suggest monthly applications.  If you want better results… use more often.

For existing shrubs, trees and plants, we recommend applying monthly.

For seedlings and new gardens, we recommend applications at planting.  After planting we suggest applications once every 7-14 days.

<p><b><i>De donde nace nuestra idea...</i></b></p>
<p>Thanks for
taking the time to review our idea for the construction of solar panels in this
small unique village of India, where with our volunteering program we have developed initiatives for the cleaning of the rivers and places where people live,
ecological education for children and now taking the project to a new level:

<p>During the
past 5 years we have developed the project A Helping Hand for Vrindavan with
which we have achieved to contribute to the ecological wellbeing of this
particular village, installing grids for the straining of garbage preventing
its deposit in the rivers and periodic cleanings with volunteers of the diverse
sacred places. We have also collected donations for mobilizations with riksas to clean the city, among many other projects. This time We want to install solar paneles in a temple in Vrindavan, inspiring the community of the locality to follow this example and
decrease the use of polluting energy such as We obtain with fossil fuels (used in motors) and
noise pollution. </p>
<p><i>Durante los últimos 5 años hemos desarrollado el proyecto Helping Hands
for Vrindavan con el cual hemos conseguido contribuir al bienestar ecológico de
este particular pueblo, instalando rejillas para la contención de basuras, el
equipo de voluntarios realiza periódicamente jornadas de limpieza de los
diferentes lugares sagrados, conseguimos la donación de riksas (bicicletas)
para la limpieza de la ciudad, entre muchos otros proyectos. Esta vez queremos instalar paneles de energía solar, con la idea de que otras comunidades de la localidad
también sigan este ejemplo y se pueda disminuir el uso de energías
contaminantes como la que se obtiene de combustibles fósiles (usado en los motores) y la contaminación
auditiva.</i></p>
<p>It’s a lot
more than just a charity program; with your contribution and the help from the
volunteer team we can give the first steps towards the use of local energy in
Vrindavan, where the community suffers the consequences of a deficient source
of energy and the contamination related with the use of noisy motors fed by
fossil fuels. </p>
<p><i>Es mucho más que un programa de caridad, con tu contribución y la ayuda
del equipo de voluntarios podremos dar el primer paso hacia la utilización de
energía solar en Vrindavan, donde la comunidad sufre las inclemencias de un
suministro deficiente de energía y la contaminación relacionada con el uso de
ruidosos motores alimentados con combustibles fósiles. </i></p>
<p>You can be a
volunteer, contribute with this pilot plan so it can be replicated in other
places and we can show that solar energy is one of the best alternatives to
protect the environment. </p>
<p><i>Tú puedes ser voluntario, contribuir con este plan piloto para que sea
replicado en otros lugares y mostremos que la energía solar es una de las
alternativas más factibles para conservar el medio ambiente.</i></p>
<p><b>Lo que
necesitamos y lo que obtienes...</b></p>
<p><b><i>What we need and what you
obtain…</i></b></p>
<p>We wish to construct solar
panels as an alternative source of renewable energy in the Eco Yoga Village
Vrinda Kunja, located in the town of Vrindavan (India).</p>
<p><i>Deseamos construir paneles solares como alternativa
de fuente de energía renovable en la Eco yoga Aldea Vrinda Kunja, localizada en
el pueblo de Vrindavan (India).</i></p>
<p>To acquire
solar panels destined to cover the total energy consumption of the community
which is of 5kWp, and install the grids to prevent the monkeys (very popular in
the village) from destroying them, we require USD 15.000. The expenses
relative to the campaign and communications are covered by the team of
volunteers of the Eco Village. </p>
<p><i>Para comprar
los paneles solares destinados a cubrir el total del consumo que es de 5kWp, e

has conserved a mystical and spiritual tradition for thousands of years. It’s
known as the city of 5000 temples and annually receives thousands of pilgrims
from around the world.  </p>

<p>We are not only thinking in

<p>-<span> 
</span>Construction and maintenance of the Hanuman School: through donations
we’ve received and with the constant help of volunteers from around the world,
we have constructed the first installations for the Hanuman School, where more
than 30 children meet daily in the afternoons and receive English and organic
agriculture classes. Some teachers are paid with the donations and others are
part of the volunteering team. </p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Cleaning the Yamuna: preventing solid plastics such as bags and bottles
to get to the river, using a system of grids installed in the wastewater
channels. Daily follow ups are made and cleanings of more than 15 areas with a
group of local workers and international volunteers from the Eco Village. These
workers are also paid with donations received in the ecological community. </p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Garbage: we´ve installed garbage containers in the most important
pilgrimage places. With hundreds of pilgrims in Vrindavan, most of the garbage
is not collected appropriately. The installation of the public containers in
the main temples generates an improvement for the environment and at the same
time is an educational program for the local inhabitants. </p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Recovering areas that represent cultural patrimony for humanity: one of
our initial achievements was to motivate local organizers to recuperate a lake
that had become dump, transforming it into a beautiful park with clean waters. </p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Restorations: one of the oldest and most important temples of Vrindavan
(Radha Gopinath Mandir) was in a state of abandonment since the last Muslim invasion.
Currently we have achieved to recuperate two areas and transform them to public
gardens. The project continues to grow and important donations have been
collected for the restoration of the temple.</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Posters and art on the streets: some volunteers offer their artistic abilities
through street theatre, posters and murals with ecological messages and
specially developing educational strategies for the issues with plastic use. As
a result from this service from the team of volunteers, we have achieved that
the population feels identified with the seriousness of the environmental
problem and participates actively in the cleanings. </p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>From plastic to natural: due to the constant flow of pilgrims in the
many temples of the town, in the past years its becoming popular to use plastic
plates leaving aside the traditional practice of organic plates made from palm
leaves as well as mud cups. Through an intense educational campaign in relation
to the harmful effects of plastic, we have now achieved that most temples
return to their traditional use of natural plates. </p>

De donde nace nuestra idea...
Thanks for
taking the time to review our idea for the construction of solar panels in this
small unique village of India, where with our volunteering program we have developed initiatives for the cleaning of the rivers and places where people live,
ecological education for children and now taking the project to a new level:
renewable energy. 
Gracias por tomarte el tiempo para revisar nuestra idea para la construcción
de paneles de energía solar en este pequeño y único pueblo en India, en donde
con el programa de voluntarios hemos desarrollado iniciativas para la limpieza
de la los lugares donde vive la gente y sus ríos, la educación ecológica de los niños y ahora
llevando el proyecto a un nuevo nivel: la energía renovable. 
During the
past 5 years we have developed the project A Helping Hand for Vrindavan with
which we have achieved to contribute to the ecological wellbeing of this
particular village, installing grids for the straining of garbage preventing
its deposit in the rivers and periodic cleanings with volunteers of the diverse
sacred places. We have also collected donations for mobilizations with riksas to clean the city, among many other projects. This time We want to install solar paneles in a temple in Vrindavan, inspiring the community of the locality to follow this example and
decrease the use of polluting energy such as We obtain with fossil fuels (used in motors) and
noise pollution. 
Durante los últimos 5 años hemos desarrollado el proyecto Helping Hands
for Vrindavan con el cual hemos conseguido contribuir al bienestar ecológico de
este particular pueblo, instalando rejillas para la contención de basuras, el
equipo de voluntarios realiza periódicamente jornadas de limpieza de los
diferentes lugares sagrados, conseguimos la donación de riksas (bicicletas)
para la limpieza de la ciudad, entre muchos otros proyectos. Esta vez queremos instalar paneles de energía solar, con la idea de que otras comunidades de la localidad
también sigan este ejemplo y se pueda disminuir el uso de energías
contaminantes como la que se obtiene de combustibles fósiles (usado en los motores) y la contaminación
auditiva.
It’s a lot
more than just a charity program; with your contribution and the help from the
volunteer team we can give the first steps towards the use of local energy in
Vrindavan, where the community suffers the consequences of a deficient source
of energy and the contamination related with the use of noisy motors fed by
fossil fuels. 
Es mucho más que un programa de caridad, con tu contribución y la ayuda
del equipo de voluntarios podremos dar el primer paso hacia la utilización de
energía solar en Vrindavan, donde la comunidad sufre las inclemencias de un
suministro deficiente de energía y la contaminación relacionada con el uso de
ruidosos motores alimentados con combustibles fósiles. 
You can be a
volunteer, contribute with this pilot plan so it can be replicated in other
places and we can show that solar energy is one of the best alternatives to
protect the environment. 
Tú puedes ser voluntario, contribuir con este plan piloto para que sea
replicado en otros lugares y mostremos que la energía solar es una de las
alternativas más factibles para conservar el medio ambiente.
Lo que
necesitamos y lo que obtienes...
What we need and what you
obtain…
We wish to construct solar
panels as an alternative source of renewable energy in the Eco Yoga Village
Vrinda Kunja, located in the town of Vrindavan (India).
Deseamos construir paneles solares como alternativa
de fuente de energía renovable en la Eco yoga Aldea Vrinda Kunja, localizada en
el pueblo de Vrindavan (India).
To acquire
solar panels destined to cover the total energy consumption of the community
which is of 5kWp, and install the grids to prevent the monkeys (very popular in
the village) from destroying them, we require USD 15.000. The expenses
relative to the campaign and communications are covered by the team of
volunteers of the Eco Village. 
Para comprar
los paneles solares destinados a cubrir el total del consumo que es de 5kWp, e
instalar rejillas para evitar que los monos (muy populares en la comunidad) los
destruyan, se requieren 15 mil dólares. Los gastos relativos a la realización y
difusión de esta campaña serán cubiertos por un equipo de voluntarios de la eco
aldea. Budget/presupuesto

I am a sea kayak guide and an outdoor educator on Canada's west coast. This campaign is important to me for obvious reasons. I love my home, my job, the unique culture and all the creatures that thrive here and provide us food and abundance. At low tide, the dinner table is set. Life is simple here. Your contribution, no matter how great or small, will help me directly help the people on the frontline's of the pipeline blockade. 

I've set a modest goal of $5000 but any amount can and will help. Here is a list from   Zoe at wildcoast.ca of what I've been asked to bring if possible:
- Batteries- Portable power pack- Small diesel generator- Chainsaws and chainsaw parts- Rubbermaid totes- Home-canned and wild food- Snow suits- CamerasI will happily except any of these items instead of cash! Especially the home canned and wild food, you can't buy that in the store! Which brings us back to the point. We are protecting and conserving unspoiled nature in all it's glory, now and forever, for future generations. No amount of money can replace that. No oil spill is ever fully cleaned up. In fact, in many cases, recovering 10% of spilled oil is considered “successful” and thus could be coined “world class,” but not necessarily “effective.” The province writes: “[Enbridge] acknowledges that it knows of no techniques to effectively remove dissolved oil from the water column.

<div>
<p>I am incredibly excited to be a part of this expedition to save the Rio Marañon. I am donating my own time and money to make this expedition happen, but I will also need your help to make this project a reality; all contributions will go towards covering project costs.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>Rio Marañon is incredibly important. Both socially and environmentally, it is the hydrological source of the Amazon. It is the lifeblood which supports thousands of unique communities and cultures along with an astounding number of diverse ecosystems. Unfortunately there are dozens of dams planned along this stretch of river which threaten to destroy the habitats both at the site and downstream.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>There is growing ecotourism in this area. Currently the river exists in a free-flowing state, and more and more people want to see ‘The Grand Canyon of South America’ before it is destroyed. Our goal is to connect local communities with this growing ecotourism. If we can create more forms of sustainable income there will bee more reasons to keep this river free flowing. <br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>As part of the Paddling with Purpose project, we are inviting between six and ten Peruvians to join us on a 17 day expedition. These young people will be from the dam affected communities of Menden and Tupen. Along the way we will teach basic whitewater skills and trade understanding of how these dams will change the communities and ecosystems. The skills we share will open up new pathways to becoming professional guides in the future.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Another way communities can profit from tourism is through selling food or goods. Instead of packing all of our food ahead of time we are planning to stop at many of these villages and buy fruit, or other types of food. When enough people start coming down this river providing logistical support to raft groups can become a viable source of income.<br/>

   What We Need 
These are the costs for the entire expedition:

Transport
$3,000


Food
$2,000    


I am part of a small group of volunteers who are working hard to make this journey happen. Together, we need to raise a minimum target of $9,000. This amount will allow us to invite six Peruvian participants. if we can raise more money, then we will have more flexibility in the program and the ability to invite more participants.

1. Safety



We will make sure that safety is a large part of every day life. When out in the middle of Peru even a broken ankle can prove to be disastrous. We will utilize normal first aid risk management, and have access to a satellite phone if need be. 
On the river we plan to teach participants rescue and whitewater safety techniques from day one.

We have a high ratio of experienced river guides to unskilled participants. The ratio will not exceed two participants to one guide but more likely will be closer to a one to one ratio.

2. Language Barrier 

Some of us speak spanish, but not all. Our team of guides are from Peru, and international; we will rely on the Spanish speaking guides to most of the explaining, while others will play a large role in safety and demonstration.

<h3>Mindful Art Activism for the Environment </h3>
<p>Your funding will support art-activism to transform burying trash in the environment into creative, neighborhood activity. Your contributions of even $5 will support a focused group of citizens looking for specific actions to prevent glass, and other resources, from being trashed. Residents of remote and wildly beautiful Upper Michigan will work with artists from City Meditation Crew, a fictitious government department, to end current habits of throwing glass, and other refuse, into the garbage. We will develop practical conservation practices: less use, reuse, and recyling. In summer 2014, City Meditaiton Crew will make a symbolic, days-long walk to the nearest recycling station to inspire solid, repeatable local change.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The possibilities are broad when potlucks are involved. Scientists, nurses, artists, teachers, gardeners, engineers, moms, and others will work together to explore small but powerful actions: perhaps we will establish a way to convert glass bottles into material the community garden can use; we have already begun looking to transform refuse into functional art; we might coodinate a recycle-ride-share system to combine routine trips to urban areas with recycling drop-offs for everyone on our block...new ideas will emerge as we gather and brainstorm. We will make our art actions and community building experiments available to other communities with similar needs through our networks and the internet. </p>
<p>Perhaps you will find some simple ideas to inspire you to conserve a little more, or take big action.</p>
<p>We need seed money of $1000 to fund carts for collecting glass and tools to transform trashed glass into useful material. For the long sybolic walk, we will need uniforms, lodging and transportation, and support for our media campaign to get the word out about our conservation and art actions.</p>
<p>For $5 we will invite you to our blog and keep you updated on our progress.</p>
<p>For $100 we will send you an art work from the project:a suite of digital images of City Meditation Crew to use as a screen saver and reminder of how attention to consumption, one moment at a time, can foster connectedness with your community. </p>
<p>A large number of small donations will position us to apply for grant funding.</p>

<h3>The Impact: Community Building, Education on Conservation Practices, Art as Action</h3>
<p>Creatvity replaces over consumption. Potlucks with zero waste build excellent habits. Living rooms beome incubators. Parents model good conservation practices for children, and vice versa. Science and art-actions unite neighbors in protecting the earth. Everyone on our block brings something to the process. Small steps add up to waves of influence and change.</p>

Turtles are important to the ecosystem of the ocean, and I think it's crucial that kids understand that what they do when they're on the beach can impact sea turtles.
My daughter and I also wrote a song to go along with the book, in the hopes that it will remind them  that sea turtles need our help.     
The money will go towards the following:
  An illustrator to draw all of the pictures that will go in the book Printing costs
Obtaining an ISBN number, so the book can be sold through retailers    
In the event I don't reach the goal amount, I plan to continue with various fundraisers until this book becomes a reality.  I have set a 30-day limit for this fundraiser because I already have an awesome illustrator lined up, and I want to get her going on this project before she gets too busy with other projects and can't do this.  Hopefully, I will raise enough money to at least pay for the first few illustrations, which will at least get things rolling.  

This project means a lot to me because our beaches and oceans have become so polluted these days.  As humans, we impact the ocean in a lot of ways, whether it's leaving trash on the beach, dumping sewage into the water, oil spills, or simply having bright lights on the beach that cause hatchlings to go in the wrong direction.  We all need to do our part to help sea turtles so our children can enjoy all the wonderful nature the universe has provided us.  
This is my third children's book, but this one is completely different from the other books that I've written because this one holds special memories I shared with my family and will benefit wonderful organizations like Turtle Time, a group based in Fort Myers Beach, Florida.

<div>We have reached the lower end of our goal $15,000. However, we are hoping you can help us push it past $20,000! </div>
<div>
<b>Why do we need more?</b> </div>
<div>We have acquired enough material for a short film but need more money to make it longer and to distribute the film to more communities in Madagascar. </div>
<div><b>What have we done so far? </b></div>
<div>We filmed enough footage for a roughly 10 min conservation education film. Our on the ground team has trained 24 community members to help monitor forests to protect them from fire. We have also cut over 6 km (4 miles) of fire breaks protecting over 350 ha (nearly 900 acres) of fragmented forest which buffers a large tract of continuous forest. </div>
<div><b>What is our plan?</b></div>
<div>We plan to go back to Madagascar to film more about the project in late October - the peak of the dry season. We will then edit and make the longer film closer to 22 min in the new year. Once edited we will distribute the film to all the communities within Ankarafantsika National Park. We will literally take an ox cart, generator, projector and screen and we will show the film to communities where fires threaten forests. Also as we describe below we will distribute the film to our partners, for viewing in other regions. Finally, we plan to air this film on Malagasy television, to increase its reach and impact. </div>
<h3>Who we are: </h3>
<div>We are <b>Planet Madagascar</b>. We are passionate about Madagascar, its people, and its wildlife. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Planet Madagascar is a conservation,

are the most endangered mammal group in the world and are found only in <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Madagascar. 94% of lemur species are threatened with extinction, largely due to
the fact that the forest habitats that they call home are rapidly disappearing at
the hands of humans.</span><br/><p></p>
<p>But it’s
complicated: 92% of the people in Madagascar live on less than $2 a day and
their survival is intrinsically linked to the exploitation of natural
resources. The need for lemur conservation and community development in
Madagascar has never been so great.</p>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Urgency:</h3>
<p>As you read this, forest is catching fire
in Madagascar and lemur habitat is disappearing. Community involvement,
education, and direct financial incentives are needed if the lemurs and the
remaining forest are to be protected in one of the world’s poorest countries.</p>
<h3>How we want to help:</h3>
<p>We want to <b>create a powe</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>rful film to educate people in Madagascar

<h3>The film:</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our film will make a vital contribution towards community involvement and education, by highlighting issues surrounding human-wildlife interactions in Madagascar and illustrating why a healthy ecosystem is beneficial to both humans and wildlife.  The film will be used as an educational tool to empower local communities to prevent fires from destroying lemur habitat.</p>
<p>Madagascar
is one of the world’s ""hottest"" biodiversity hotspots, which means it is home
to an extraordinarily high number of species that are found nowhere else in the
world. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates that
94% of lemur species—all of which are found only in Madagascar— are threatened
with extinction, due to human-induced habitat disturbance. Uncontrolled fires play a major

</div></div>","Campaign Update:
We have reached the lower end of our goal $15,000. However, we are hoping you can help us push it past $20,000! 

Why do we need more? 
We have acquired enough material for a short film but need more money to make it longer and to distribute the film to more communities in Madagascar. 
What have we done so far? 
We filmed enough footage for a roughly 10 min conservation education film. Our on the ground team has trained 24 community members to help monitor forests to protect them from fire. We have also cut over 6 km (4 miles) of fire breaks protecting over 350 ha (nearly 900 acres) of fragmented forest which buffers a large tract of continuous forest. 
What is our plan?
We plan to go back to Madagascar to film more about the project in late October - the peak of the dry season. We will then edit and make the longer film closer to 22 min in the new year. Once edited we will distribute the film to all the communities within Ankarafantsika National Park. We will literally take an ox cart, generator, projector and screen and we will show the film to communities where fires threaten forests. Also as we describe below we will distribute the film to our partners, for viewing in other regions. Finally, we plan to air this film on Malagasy television, to increase its reach and impact. 
Who we are: 
We are Planet Madagascar. We are passionate about Madagascar, its people, and its wildlife. Planet Madagascar is a conservation,
education, and community development project, aiming to promote lemur species
conservation by building local capacity in communities in Northwest Madagascar.









What we want:
We want to work with local communities in Madagascar to stop fires from destroying lemur habitat.  

Why it matters:



Lemurs
are the most endangered mammal group in the world and are found only in Madagascar. 94% of lemur species are threatened with extinction, largely due to
the fact that the forest habitats that they call home are rapidly disappearing at
the hands of humans.
But it’s
complicated: 92% of the people in Madagascar live on less than $2 a day and
their survival is intrinsically linked to the exploitation of natural
resources. The need for lemur conservation and community development in
Madagascar has never been so great.


Urgency:
As you read this, forest is catching fire
in Madagascar and lemur habitat is disappearing. Community involvement,
education, and direct financial incentives are needed if the lemurs and the
remaining forest are to be protected in one of the world’s poorest countries.
How we want to help:
We want to create a powerful film to educate people in Madagascar
about how fire is destroying lemur habitat and what they can do to help prevent fire. The film will highlight fire management solutions that our
organization, in partnership with local communities, plans to implement. Our broader goal is to find ways of helping people improve their livelihoods while saving lemurs and their habitat.


The ask:
We need your help raising money to make a
compelling educational film. We need funds to cover the costs of filming and editing.




The film:



Our film will make a vital contribution towards community involvement and education, by highlighting issues surrounding human-wildlife interactions in Madagascar and illustrating why a healthy ecosystem is beneficial to both humans and wildlife.  The film will be used as an educational tool to empower local communities to prevent fires from destroying lemur habitat.
Madagascar
is one of the world’s ""hottest"" biodiversity hotspots, which means it is home
to an extraordinarily high number of species that are found nowhere else in the
world. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates that
94% of lemur species—all of which are found only in Madagascar— are threatened
with extinction, due to human-induced habitat disturbance. Uncontrolled fires play a major
role in the loss of lemur habitat in Madagascar. 
Unfortunately,
Madagascar also suffers from immense poverty, and people often exploit the
habitat simply to feed their families. The habitat needed by lemurs is also needed for people. Community involvement, education, and direct
financial benefits are needed if the lemurs and the remaining forest are to be
protected in one of the world’s poorest countries.

I'll be solo hiking for 28-32 days Southbound on the Pacific Crest Trail (Rainy Pass to Forest Road 23), totaling 361 Miles. I'm hoping to keep the trip to 3 re-supplies along the route.This crowdfunding campaign was inspired after conversations with several of you about how you could support my trip and my practical realization of how much food I will need to purchase, prepare, pack, and carry to fuel my way.Contributions will be used to purchase: food for all of my meals, any remaining gear costs, postage costs to get my supply boxes to my pickup locations, and a potential splurge meal and hot shower during resupplies. If there are funds remaining, I am inspired to add them to my seed fund for a small business that is just beginning to sprout in its planning stage. I am excited to share more about this through updates in the coming weeks! This has been a huge next step that has been inspired by the process of planning/preparing for this PCT adventure.Other ways to support & connect:

Sign up to receive updates from my campaign. This way I can let you know how to follow my adventure. *You can do this without donating funds.
Join me in this playful food challenge!

Share your tips! I eat fresh, nutrient dense foods daily. How the heck will I eat (and carry) the daily calories I need for this type of trek without leaning into a common backpackers diet of snickers, instant mashed potatoes, and buckets of trail mix? Share your tips (and recipes) about nutrient-dense, light weight foods that are non-perishable.

Make a goody box. If you have favorite trail snacks and feel inspired mail some my way, I will happily add them to the beginnings of my food boxes. Also know, if it is something I can get locally, just send your suggestion and I can track it down here.
**Note: I'll be happy to share my current menu plan in a future update. 


Get out to your local trails. Find a new trail or a new trail hiking buddy. Learn a new plant by name. Learn a new story about a place you have been a million times. Be curious!
Check out the gallery of photos on this site. I posted my favorite pictures from my solo and group hikes over the last 3-months. 
If you are a Pacific Northwest local or might be in the area late August-September, let me know. Anyone who feels called to join me on the trail for a night or weekend is welcome at my campfire!
Questions, inspirations, curiosities? I'm here: beauty.of.peace@gmail.com Why Backpacking? And for 30 days?!It was mid-January. The neighborhood streets of Portland were full of neighbors grumbling about shoveling snow while kids were still elated by the unexpected ability to build snow people, huge snow forts, and sled in the local park. In this true feeling of winter, I felt a great hunger for beginning something new that was creative and challenged me. Something that would help me see myself with a new lens, in a new space of confidence and clarity about my purpose and direction.I chose the PCT. Exercise has always been an important part of my mental health. I don't know about you, but I definitely have a wild bunch of monkeys who love the landscape of my mind and cause major damage if I am not mindful. When I exercise, I feel like the monkeys are the ones that exercise and then they get tired and I experience my clear sight and mind...and find a closer sense of connection to myself. Backpacking has been an amazing way to move my body and immerse myself in lands that I love. All this felt perfect for me. Then, my dad sent me these photos of himself at age 23. He was stationed at the Air Force Base in Phoenix, Arizona at the time. This was a trip of his to the Grand Canyon. I got chills looking at them. A chord sung inside me. Family medicine and passions sometimes share the same well. As my PCT planning continued, I was pulled to revisit memories of previous backpacking trips over the years. In doing so, I found these pictures -- along with a renewed sense of awe and gratitude for my parents taking us on this adventure-- of our family backpacking trip down to Havasupai Falls. Seriously!My good friend Robert came with us as Nathan chose to stay home. I still get teased about how we carrying our AP Calculus book back and forth in our backpacks so we could do homework on the trail...which I don't actually remember happening. Besides weekend trips with friends and partners, my most recent backpacking adventure was my two months in India with Sierra Institute for a Himalayan backpacking field study program in 2005. An incredible opportunity, our studies focused on the geology, natural history and sustainable development initiatives within Ladakh (Northen India). My friend Greta and I did our research on gender and women's access to professional and educational opportunities. We met some amazing women! Climbing peaks and passes over 17,000 ft ""topped off"" the experience.​Remembering these stories has helped me realize something. That being out on the trail has always been a part of how I have moved in my life. It has always been a part of what I imagined was possible for me.

<h3>Who we are and what we want to do</h3>
<p><a href=""http://internationaltreefoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">International Tree Foundation</a> (ITF) is a charity that was founded in Kenya in 1924 to encourage people the world over to plant, care for and love their trees. In 2016 we launched our Centenary Campaign: 20 Million Trees for Kenya's Forests, which will be planted by 2024. The first stage of this project is our work with Mount Kenya Environmental Conservation (MKEC) in Embu County and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Mount Kenya’s forests are vital – for wildlife, for freshwater resources, and for the materials they provide to local people. Sadly, these forests cover only a fraction of their original area, much of which is degraded in quality. Local people recognise that the forests need to be protected – but they also contribute to the damage, not out of choice but because they have to.</p>
<p>Even today, Kenya’s rural communities are heavily dependent on forests for their livelihoods. Esther Nyaga is a 47-year-old farmer with two children. She owns half an acre of land in Kanja village, Embu County. Her land is largely dedicated to growing tea, a profitable crop she can sell to support herself and her family. Because she has so few trees – less than 30 - she visits the forest twice a week to collect fuel wood and fodder for her cow.</p>
<p>Esther knows the forest is important to her life, and she is one of the most experienced people in Kanja village when it comes to raising and planting trees. For farmers like Esther, planting trees doesn’t just provide fuel and animal fodder. Different species can provide a whole variety of benefits – nitrogen fixing for soil improvement, nutritious fruits such as mango and avocado, shade, timber, and medicinal uses. They also grow native species with which to restore the forest edge.</p>
<p>Esther is one (remarkable) woman. We want to raise £5,000 so that every farmer in Kanja can plant 50 trees on their land – a total of 20,000 trees providing vital resources to rural families while protecting Mount Kenya’s majestic forest.</p>
<p>Will you help?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need and what you get</h3>

International Tree Foundation (ITF) is a charity that was founded in Kenya in 1924 to encourage people the world over to plant, care for and love their trees. In 2016 we launched our Centenary Campaign: 20 Million Trees for Kenya's Forests, which will be planted by 2024. The first stage of this project is our work with Mount Kenya Environmental Conservation (MKEC) in Embu County and surrounding areas.
Mount Kenya’s forests are vital – for wildlife, for freshwater resources, and for the materials they provide to local people. Sadly, these forests cover only a fraction of their original area, much of which is degraded in quality. Local people recognise that the forests need to be protected – but they also contribute to the damage, not out of choice but because they have to.
Even today, Kenya’s rural communities are heavily dependent on forests for their livelihoods. Esther Nyaga is a 47-year-old farmer with two children. She owns half an acre of land in Kanja village, Embu County. Her land is largely dedicated to growing tea, a profitable crop she can sell to support herself and her family. Because she has so few trees – less than 30 - she visits the forest twice a week to collect fuel wood and fodder for her cow.
Esther knows the forest is important to her life, and she is one of the most experienced people in Kanja village when it comes to raising and planting trees. For farmers like Esther, planting trees doesn’t just provide fuel and animal fodder. Different species can provide a whole variety of benefits – nitrogen fixing for soil improvement, nutritious fruits such as mango and avocado, shade, timber, and medicinal uses. They also grow native species with which to restore the forest edge.
Esther is one (remarkable) woman. We want to raise £5,000 so that every farmer in Kanja can plant 50 trees on their land – a total of 20,000 trees providing vital resources to rural families while protecting Mount Kenya’s majestic forest.
Will you help?

What we need and what you get
The average cost of raising and planting a sapling in this area, including all the costs of tools, training and so on, is roughly 25p. £5,000 is our goal because it equates to enough for every farmer in Esther's village to plant 50 trees. The money will pay for seeds, materials, and training for local people on how to raise, plant and care for their trees.
We're excited to offer some great perks from some of our friends and corporate partners such as Batelier Handicrafts, Get Laid Beds and Wessanen UK (the company behind Clipper Teas, Whole Earth, Mrs Crimbles, Kallo and Almond Breeze).

Reverdece, is a non-profit organism founded in 2004, that has been developing projects and ideas to contribute to the environmental welfare of our country, Mexico.
We've been developing a national and international network of people concerned with the environmental situation in our country, especially in our region.
However, this campaign will be focused on developing an educational kit used to create forestry awareness in Mexican children and teenagers. This kit, which is actually in a very advanced stage of creative development, will provide the youngster a very easy way to plant trees, vegetables, flowers, etc., and, thus, see how important is to take care of our natural resources.
 This kit will have the following components:

1 EPS (re-usable) container to plant anything the users would consider to plant.
A package of seeds.
A package of organic soil.
A very friendly manual to understand the process of reforestation and the importance of our forests.
A proper plastic greenhouse to emulate the conditions required to grow a plant.
A portable carton box, used as a recipient for the components.

So, in order to produce this eco-kit we need all the monetary aid we can get from you and any sponsor!

$2,500 on transporting the first production (1,000 units) around our regional schools to test the efficiency of this product.
$2,500 on salaries for the personal involved in teacher's environmental training to use the device in the school properly.

<p>My wife Rachel and I are passionate about our future, which we feel are our children and the environment. We love Baja California Mexico, the people and the land. Each year we work hard to bring awareness to the needs of the orphaned children and fragile environment.</p>
<p>In 2011, we created the <a href=""http://youtu.be/fUfsZ1qwiqU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Baja Love Ride</a> and rode bicycles from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of California, staying at orphanages to raise awareness and <a href=""http://youtu.be/fUfsZ1qwiqU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">much-needed funds for the children</a>. In 2012, we create the <a href=""http://bglclub.com/challenges/the-baja-walk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Baja Walk</a> and the two of us walked unassisted, the full 850 mile length of Baja California to support various orphanages and environmental causes, but during the 74-day walk we saw the amount of the plastic waste and litter and the growth of the problem. </p>
<p>This year our focus is litter and plastic waste. Corporations continue to put everything in plastic packaging, yet neither the corporation, many from the United States, the Mexican government, or the local municipalities provide sufficient trash receptacles, trash pickup or environmental education. Therefore, most trash is thrown to the ground, where it makes its way into the sea, ocean, and deserts. So, this year in an effort to capture the attention of the youth, we are building a raft with a paddlewheel and pedaling the craft 600 miles down the coast of Baja California in the Sea of Cortez, stopping in 8 coastal communities to provide bilingual literature and information on the dangers of litter and plastic waste. In addition, we have established our 3 primary goals of Chatarra Project, listed below.</p>
<p>Every donation you make brings us one step closer to a CLEAN BAJA! Your contribution to Baja is important to us, so we would like to provide supporters with our appreciation. To accomplish the <a href=""http://chatarra.bglclub.com/our-goal/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""The Goal’s of the Chatarra Project"">goal of the Project Chatarra</a>, ONLY $5000 is needed to be raised, which is asking so little, to accomplish so much.</p>
<h2>What is the Chatarra Project Mission?</h2>

<h3>Our Goal is Simple: CLEAN BAJA!</h3>
<p>Here<strong> three ways</strong> we want to help with your help:</p>
<p><strong>Our #1 Goal</strong> is to create awareness to the problem of waste and litter in Baja California. We want to draw attention to the problem through a variety of activities including the building and the 600 mile Sea of Cortez expedition of the Chatarra Raft, a boat made of repurposed materials, floated on reused plastic bottles and pedal powered. The expedition’s goal is to capture the attention of the youth, and to provide engaging bilingual educational materials in 8 coastal communities of Baja.</p>
<p><strong>Our #2 Goal</strong> is work with, support, and or create a network of people in each of Baja’s communities that desire to help CLEAN BAJA! To raise enough funds through the sell of t-shirts to help provide supplies and resources and to bring people and groups together, so others may become aware and support or join them locally.</p>
<p><strong>Our #3 Goal</strong> is to establish a CLEAN BAJA DAY that benefits the environment and helps beautify Baja. Participants in a community CLEAN BAJA DAY can include the entire family, both children and adults. The event will bring the community together and create a sense of pride in making the community a better place to live. We will include prizes, games and a Chatarra Plastic Bottle Boat Race.</p>

Entrepreneurs from Switzerland, United States and Haiti . We seek to provide a

eradication of cholera. The Bacteriological Treatment Unit (BTU ) aims to
address 3 main vectors of vibro cholerae that are:  water , fruits and
Legumes, from two natural resources : Air and Solar Energy, hence the chemical
reaction:( 0 + 02+ E = 03  ) establishing the Ozone . To achieve this
goal, we conceived the pilot project from the cholera eradication program

WE SPECIFY THE FOLLOWING:</span></blockquote><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">-SMG Global Haiti won the contest for the best ""Business

- The Chairman of SMG Global Haiti , Swiss citizen , has already experienced
these new technologies in Switzerland and Mexico. He has twenty years of
experience in the field of water purification, including a dozen in the
bacteriological water treatment in Mexico, which had similar problems in the
years 2000</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/>

-There is no structure in Haiti providing the specific service processing
fruits and Legumes (vegetables) considered two main vectors of Vibrio cholerae after

OUR GOAL
Introducing in Haiti the
OZONE Water Treatment Technology in order to make treated
water accessible to the vulnerable population at low cost and achieve the eradication of cholera
WHO ARE WE?We are a group of Social
Entrepreneurs from Switzerland, United States and Haiti . We seek to provide a
reference company  in the domain of  bacteriological water treatment
in order to provide a solution to the water issues in Haiti and consequently,
eradication of cholera. The Bacteriological Treatment Unit (BTU ) aims to
address 3 main vectors of vibro cholerae that are:  water , fruits and
Legumes, from two natural resources : Air and Solar Energy, hence the chemical
reaction:( 0 + 02+ E = 03  ) establishing the Ozone . To achieve this
goal, we conceived the pilot project from the cholera eradication program
approved by the Ministry of Public Health.The first  bacteriological
treatment Unit (BTU ) will be installed in port-au- prince, but the ultimate
goal is to have a BTU in thirty local municipalities, starting with the most
vulnerable and involving Municipalities and local organizations.WHAT WE HAVE - WHAT WE NEED 
A physical
structure already exists for the installation of the first BTU  in Haiti.
The total estimated project cost is $ $400,000; however, the founding
members have contributed $ 200,000 . We only need the technical structure
including the cost of equipment which is estimated at $200,000

cholera in the Metropolitan areaFOR AN ASSESSMENT OF
THE SCOPE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE FIRST BACTERIOLOGICAL WATER TREATMENT IN HAITI,
WE SPECIFY THE FOLLOWING:-SMG Global Haiti won the contest for the best ""Business
Plan 2013 "" organized by USAID/PADF ( document available ) so the ROI is
guaranteed as well as the social aspect, as a percentage of the profit will be used for the installation of the second BTU
- The Chairman of SMG Global Haiti , Swiss citizen , has already experienced
these new technologies in Switzerland and Mexico. He has twenty years of
experience in the field of water purification, including a dozen in the
bacteriological water treatment in Mexico, which had similar problems in the
years 2000
-The BTU  enables the vulnerable people of the population to have access
to treated water at the lowest cost , while protecting the market and
population stability
-There is no structure in Haiti providing the specific service processing
fruits and Legumes (vegetables) considered two main vectors of Vibrio cholerae after
water, which makes the erection of  BTU  an innovative and profitable
project
-Thirty municipalities starting with the most vulnerable are concerned by the
project in the medium or long term but they all depend on the first
bacteriological treatment Unit. SMG intends to make the first  BTU, a
""Success Story""
THE ALTERNATIVEIn case we do not reach the amount of $ 200,000. We are ready to
apply for funding. However, if the
amount referred is higher, the difference will be directed towards the
implementation of the 2nd bacteriological treatment Unit(BTU ) in Petite
Rivière de l' Artibonite, vulnerable area, the birthplace of cholera virus.
All philanthropists, social entrepreneurs, or organizations that have made
substantial contributions to the installation of the First BTU in Haiti shall
have honorary plaques erected in their names in front of the premises as contributing
to the eradication of Cholera in Haiti.

Suisse, Américaine, Haïtienne. Nous avons monté en Haiti une compagnie de référence en traitement bactériologique de l'eau dans le but d'apporter une solution à la problématique de l'eau en Haiti et par voie de conséquence, l’éradication du cholera. L’Unité de traitement bactériologique (UTB)  vise  à  attaquer les 3 principaux vecteurs du vibro cholerea que sont: l'eau, les fruits et les légumes, à partir de 2 ressources naturelles: l'air et l’énergie solaire d'où la réaction chimique: (0 + 02 + E= 03) créant l'Ozone.                                   Pour atteindre cet objectif, nous avons mis en oeuvre le projet pilote émanant du programme d' éradication du cholera approuvé par le Ministère de la Sante Publique.La 1ere Unité de traitement bactériologique (UTB) sera installée à port-au-prince mais l’objectif final est d'avoir une UTB dans une trentaine de collectivités territoriales en commençant par les plus vulnérables et en impliquant les organisations et les autorités locales.Ce que nous avons,ce que nous recherchonsToute la structure physique existe déjà pour
l'installation de la 1ere UTB en Haiti. .Le coût total du projet est de $400.000; cependant, les membres fondateurs ont déjà contribué  à hauteur de $200.000; il ne manque que la structure technique  dont le coût des Equipements est évalué  à  $200.000.Votre contribution peut être en espèce ou en machinerie &  Equipements.

Enfin reconnaître l'eau insalubre comme première cause de mortalité dans le monde(1).3,6 millions de personnes meurent chaque année de causes liées à l'eau insalubre (diarrhée, choléra, typhoïde, hépatite...). Il est urgent de lutter contre ce fléau plus efficacement.Revoir sérieusement les chiffres de référence cités par les Nations Unies.Les Nations Unies font indéniablement progresser l'accès à l'eau dans le monde. Mais leur évaluation selon laquelle 783 millions d'êtres humains n'auraient pas accès à l'eau potable n'est pas juste. Selon des études sérieuses, ils sont en fait près de 3,5 milliards à boire chaque jour de l'eau dangereuse ou de qualité douteuse. L'ONU doit revoir ses modes de calcul et sa communication à ce sujet.Faire de l'accès à l'eau, à l'hygiène et à l'assainissement une priorité à part entière des Objectifs de Développement du Millénaire (OMD) des Nations Unies pour la période 2015-2030.Ils ne constituent aujourd'hui qu'une cible secondaire (cible C) de l'objectif 7 dédié à l'environnement, alors qu'il s'agit d'une question de vie ou de mort pour des millions d'êtres humains. C'est donc une priorité majeure qui doit à l'avenir constituer un objectif à part entière.Augmenter significativement les fonds de l'Aide Publique au Développement (APD) affectés à l'accès à l'eau potable, à l'assainissement et à l'hygiène.Ces fonds doivent plus que doubler. L'effort de la communauté internationale a été de 7,4 milliards de dollars en 2008, dont 3,5 en prêts et 3,9 en dons, là où il en faudrait au moins 18 selon l'Organisation Mondiale de la Santé (OMS). 5ème contributeur dans le monde, la France a fortement augmenté sa contribution ces dernières années, avec un montant de 600 millions d'euros. Mais 95 % de ce budget est affecté sous forme de prêts à des pays émergents solvables. Nous proposons de consacrer au moins 15 % de ces 600 millions d'euros à des dons pour des situations d'urgence humanitaire pour sauver des vies.Accroître les fonds dédiés aux crises humanitairesApporter rapidement l'eau potable et l'assainissement aux populations menacées par les maladies liées à l'eau (diarrhée, choléra, typhoïde...) est une priorité absolue en cas de conflit, de catastrophe naturelle et de déplacement de populations.Coordonner effectivement les institutions responsables pour organiser efficacement la transition des phases d'urgence vers les phases de reconstruction puis de développement.Dans les situations de crise, nous pouvons témoigner que le lien entre les phases d'urgence, de reconstruction et de développement fait défaut parmi les institutions financières responsables qui doivent se coordonner pour mieux secourir les populations en danger avec leurs partenaires (ONG, agences…).Créer un mécanisme international d'information fiable et à jour.Cet outil devrait indiquer l'état et la répartition des besoins, les engagements internationaux pris et les actions réalisées, et présenter le suivi des objectifs à atteindre dans un rapport public régulier sur internet.Faire que le droit humain à l'eau potable voté par les Nations Unies devienne une réalité.Les propositions de notre pétition ont pour objectif d'accélérer la réalisation effective du droit humain à l'eau voté par les Nations Unies le 28 juillet 2010.(1) Les maladies cardio-vasculaires, qui provoquent plus de victimes, sont liées à l'âge. Les maladies hydriques affectent une majorité d'enfants de par le monde

The UC community helped make history in Toronto by passing a ban on the sale and possession of shark fin in Canada's largest city! Councillors voted 38-4 in favor of the ban and spoke passionately about the need to take shark conservation efforts to the federal level. 

AND THAT IS JUST WHAT WE WILL DO!

We are working with Members of Parliament to help raise awareness, and once the bill is introduced we will be launching Fin Free Canada - with a federal petition to support the ban as well as tools and resources to take action in your own community! 


YOU CAN HELP SAVE SHARKS NOW!
#1 - Educate yourself, watch Sharkwater, read up on shark conservation issues worldwide 
#2 - Join the UC Mailing list for updates on campaigns as they happen!
#3 - Donate to UC now and support the campaign to make Canada Fin Free

Help take the Fin Free movement across Canada! Your contribution helps provide the tools and resources we need to empower communities across Canada to initiate their own local campaigns. 


NEW PERKS!
$5 helps spread the message of conservation! UC will send a tweet, post or email to support pending shark fin legislation in Canada. 

$15 donates a DVD to a school in Canada to help educate kids about sharks! Help us raise awareness and engage students in conservation. 

 
The Fin Free movement has ignited faster and bigger than we could have hoped for. The passion and commitment of this community of conservationists is helping to make REAL CHANGE HAPPEN to protect sharks in Canada. With your help, we can bring the Fin Free campaign globally!
 

Join UC today! Help save the ecosystems we depend on
 
United Conservationists (UC) is a revolutionary new NGO nine years and 30 countries in the making. What
started out as a mission to save sharks hurdled our tiny team into the biggest
battle ever fought – saving humanity from the converging environmental crises
of the 21st century. 
 
In 2007 we released Sharkwater, which
changed government policy, spawned conservation groups, and united a movement
to protect sharks. For nine years we’ve been saving sharks with the help of supporters
and volunteers, working out of a garage in downtown Toronto. But now the
problem is much bigger than sharks and we need the resources to affect change
on a greater scale.
 
By mid-century
scientists predict the end of fisheries, coral reefs and rainforests, and half
the world’s population will lack sufficient food and water. This is the biggest
issue we’ve ever faced, and we need your help to tackle it. 
 
To change the world
in the most profound way possible, we’ve united a dream team of
conservationists to launch the most revolutionary and powerful NGO imaginable.
UC has a proven strategy – educate the public about the issues and give them
the blueprint for change. It’s worked for sharks and it can
work again, if we work together. 
 
UC is seeking funding
to build the movement to save the ecosystems we depend on for survival, and
ultimately humanity. This issue is too big to tackle from a garage…. We need
your help. 
 
In 2011, United Conservationists
are:
 
-       
Working
with Ecovision Asia to distribute 10,000 Sharkwater DVDs to schools in China
-       
Releasing Sharkwater on public TV in China (targeting
220 million people)
-       
Spearheading
the Fin Free Toronto campaign to ban shark fins in Toronto, Ontario and across
Canada
-       
Releasing ""Revolution"", Rob Stewart’s new
feature film about saving humanity from our environmental crisis. The release
features accompanying study guides, the book “How-to Guide to Save Humanity”,
free online distribution of the film, and school curriculum inserts. 
-       
Releasing
“Revolution Mobile” – a mobile application that puts democracy in your hand, counting
down the votes necessary to influence government policy susceptible to public
opinion – changing the world in real time.
 
Your
contributions are vital to taking our organization to the next level, and
creating the resources to unite everyone as a conservationist. We aren’t just
fundraising, we are building a community! UC has achieved a great amount of
good with very little so far. Now we need to change the world in a huge way, and
we need your financial support to do so. Our kids and our future depend on it. 
 
Join United Conservationists and be a part of a revolutionary movement for conservation. 
 



WHAT YOU GET!



Not only will you
receive our heart-felt gratitude and some amazing perks, you get to be a part
of something bigger than all of us – a change in humanity. You’ll be a founder
of an innovative conservation movement to unite everyone as a force for change.

 
Contributions of $50
or more reward you with a UC membership, giving you access to exclusive limited
edition UC swag, screenings, and UC events worldwide. Reward your school with a
membership to Team UC for access to
special screenings, outreach tool kits and exclusive Team UC gear.
 
Take advantage of our one-of-a-kind
perks including dinner with Rob Stewart, Revolution
red carpet premiere passes, a wilderness canoe trip or exotic diving

<p>Earthship Biotecture plans to build an off-grid, self-sustained home for a family living on Six Nations of the Grand River Territory, in the summer of 2016.   I have been organizing this project for almost 3 years, and we have finally set a building date.  We will break ground July 18th 2016, and I have personally pledged to raise $5000.  Please help me meet this goal.</p>
<p>The Haudenosaunee family faces a housing crisis, and the countless obstacles which make getting a housing loan next to impossible for people who live far below the poverty line.</p>
<p>The family is in desperate need of a healthier and more cost effective shelter, as they have been living in a condemned trailer for years. The trailer has several holes where you can see straight through to the outside, a rodent infestation, mold, old brass pipes that get clogged constantly, next to no insulation, and a leaking roof. The owner does not think it will make it through the winter. She supports her daughter, who is a single mother, and 5 grandchildren, aged 1, 5, 9, 12 and 16. </p>
<p>She will be welcoming all peoples to watch, participate and learn from this building process. She looks forward to being a part of showing that it takes grassroots people power to address the housing and energy crisis.</p>
<p>The new off grid home will be built using Architect, Michael Reynold's, Earthship design.  The Earthship Home features:</p>
<p>?- Thermal &amp; Solar Heating and Cooling?- Solar &amp; Wind Electricity</p>
<p>?- Contained Sewage Treatment?- Building with Natural &amp; Recycled Materials?</p>
<p>- Water Harvesting</p>
<p>?- Internal Food Production?? </p>
<p>During the building process, we will host a free Sustainable Building Workshop for members of Six Nations interested in construction skill development. Our hope is to provide members of the community - especially youth-  with the skills needed to replicate the building, and an opportunity to develop a local sustainable building crew.?? Through fundraising and public outreach, it is our hope that we will generate enough interest and financial support during this project, that we may continue to build and teach in other Indigenous communities throughout Canada.?? </p>
<p>Primary Goals:??</p>
<p>- to prove that sustainable and affordable methods of housing exist.??</p>
<p>- to prove that with organization and skill development, communities can provide this housing for themselves with locally sourced labour and materials, through hands-on education and training.??</p>
<p>- to engage a community in an environmentally conscious project, to enhance community knowledge and understanding of sustainability concepts.??</p>
<p>- to provide a family with economic independence from fluctuating energy and water costs.??</p>
<p>- to offer a positive, and practical solution to a country wide housing and environmental crisis.</p>
<p>We need to raise $20,000 more for this project through donations and sponsorships.  Please consider making any contribution you can.</p>

<h4>What is permaculture ?
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Permaculture is a design system that aims to create sustainable, environmentally sound and economically viable human habitats. Habitats capable of producing enough to meet their needs, without exploiting resources or polluting. and rather regenerating for the long term. </p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Approach</b></p>
<p>As a growing community we dream to have a representation of two people from each country through Latin America and the Caribbean. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The main goal is to bring the voice of diversity among the participants' local movement to weave council around these life styles and their practical tools, methods and techniques of regenerative design.</span></p>
<p>This is a huge chance to approach<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> the diversity of the continent and strengthen national networks that will replicate the innovations and developments shared at the Convergence.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What we need and what you get</span><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>The money raised will be used to cover 100 % of the registration fees of 64  Latin Americans  of 32 countries that already have manifested their intention to travel to Colombia and participate in the Latin American Permaculture Convergence.</li>
<li>In case of having surplus we will support the transportation to the people who have lesser opportunities.</li>
<li>CASA network  ( Council of sustainable settlements of the Americas) offers as a reward the possibility to come and spend time learning permacultural tools and techniques at several countries of the continent ! Learn and join us in this beautiful work!</li>

<div>
<p><b>The impact</b></p>
<p>The risk is not being <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilience"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">resilient</a>, learning to change and live better through understanding that we are a human family that breathes with Mother Earth.Our challenge is to see change, in our daily lives, in the enjoyable time of being here and now, doing something that helps us to live in peace-happiness with the Earth, its cycles, the people, and ourselves.Make a donation so those who work tirelessly for the welfare of all beings on the planet, continue their example in different countries and communities, processes which promote:</p>
<ul>
<li>care for free seeds, and clean ecological agriculture</li>
<li>conscious and healthy food from the territory, seasonal, organic and obtained through fair trade</li>
<li>the use of tools for the development of the full human potential</li>
<li>the use of alternative energy and construction methods that reduce the negative impact of our footprint in the world.</li>
<li>experimenting new forms of dynamic government in our communities and cities</li>
<li>children's education and adult re-education in the principles of abundance, confidence, transparent communication and the ability to be co-creators of the world</li>
<li>rediscovering the value of ancestral methods of exchanging goods and services, in which value is more important than the price</li>
<li>the establishment of collaborative networks to share knowledge</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Meet the Latin American Permaculture Convergence, CLAP 2015</b></h4>It is a space for weaving the network of people, organizations and networks of permaculture in Latin America. A platform to create synergies, to strengthen the initiatives either private, communitary ,local, national and continental. A space for the expansion of permaculture at a continental level and a preparation of the progress made as a Latin America delegation at the International Permaculture Convergence in the UK - UK CPI in September 2015. <br/>We are also inviting to participate people who want to link in with the movement. CLAP aims to congregate people linked with permaculture, that have embraced this tool for the design of their stainability in their territories and projects.<br/>

Weaving Regenerative Solutions:



The most influential Permaculture event  in the continent needs your support , help us by donating and sharing this cross-cultural educational initiative. With your help , we will grant 68 full scholarships to outstanding designers of sustainable habitats from 34 countries throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. 
This convergence is a key sociocultural effort to rise the collective awareness of regenerative solutions. Join us to build up community while moving towards a more sustainable lifestyle, that encourages wellbeing practices in all diferent daily life aspects: economic, social , environmental and cultural.



What is permaculture ?


Permaculture is a design system that aims to create sustainable, environmentally sound and economically viable human habitats. Habitats capable of producing enough to meet their needs, without exploiting resources or polluting. and rather regenerating for the long term. 
Approach
As a growing community we dream to have a representation of two people from each country through Latin America and the Caribbean. The main goal is to bring the voice of diversity among the participants' local movement to weave council around these life styles and their practical tools, methods and techniques of regenerative design.
This is a huge chance to approach the diversity of the continent and strengthen national networks that will replicate the innovations and developments shared at the Convergence.
What we need and what you get

The money raised will be used to cover 100 % of the registration fees of 64  Latin Americans  of 32 countries that already have manifested their intention to travel to Colombia and participate in the Latin American Permaculture Convergence.
In case of having surplus we will support the transportation to the people who have lesser opportunities.
CASA network  ( Council of sustainable settlements of the Americas) offers as a reward the possibility to come and spend time learning permacultural tools and techniques at several countries of the continent ! Learn and join us in this beautiful work!


The impact
The risk is not being resilient, learning to change and live better through understanding that we are a human family that breathes with Mother Earth.Our challenge is to see change, in our daily lives, in the enjoyable time of being here and now, doing something that helps us to live in peace-happiness with the Earth, its cycles, the people, and ourselves.Make a donation so those who work tirelessly for the welfare of all beings on the planet, continue their example in different countries and communities, processes which promote:

care for free seeds, and clean ecological agriculture
conscious and healthy food from the territory, seasonal, organic and obtained through fair trade
the use of tools for the development of the full human potential
the use of alternative energy and construction methods that reduce the negative impact of our footprint in the world.
experimenting new forms of dynamic government in our communities and cities
children's education and adult re-education in the principles of abundance, confidence, transparent communication and the ability to be co-creators of the world
rediscovering the value of ancestral methods of exchanging goods and services, in which value is more important than the price
the establishment of collaborative networks to share knowledge

Meet the Latin American Permaculture Convergence, CLAP 2015It is a space for weaving the network of people, organizations and networks of permaculture in Latin America. A platform to create synergies, to strengthen the initiatives either private, communitary ,local, national and continental. A space for the expansion of permaculture at a continental level and a preparation of the progress made as a Latin America delegation at the International Permaculture Convergence in the UK - UK CPI in September 2015. We are also inviting to participate people who want to link in with the movement. CLAP aims to congregate people linked with permaculture, that have embraced this tool for the design of their stainability in their territories and projects.


CLAP 2015 is organized by:         

Complementary event ECCO
For further networking strengthening, we will carry out the Continental Meeting of CASA (Council of Sustainable Settlements of the Americas ) in Aldeafeliz ecovillage at San Francisco, Cundinamarca, Colombia. ECCO will echo through the wills in action intended to take part politically by offering the knowledge recovered  across permaculture networks and in intentional communities seeking sustainability and harmonious coexistence of humanity at their territories.

I live in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains outside Asheville NC. I am a NC native, however I did relocate to Montana for about 4 years. I am a mother of 5. I have owned my own business since I was 17. I still have the first major contract that I started with 34 years ago. I own an Inventory Service Company and still take seasonal physical inventory counts for Hallmark Cards and several other retail chains.  However a few years ago I found myself in a position no one should ever have to deal with. I gave up my business accounts to move to Montana in support of my husbands new job opportunity. After we lived there the 4 years we decided to move back to NC. He wanted to leave ahead of me and the children to get us a home secured. He had been gone for about 2 months before the children and I followed. We left with a U-haul , his F250 truck and a mini van loaded down and headed across country. We arrived back in Asheville late one evening in June to find that not only did we have no home to live in, but my husband had left. He showed up to announce to us that he had spent our money, and had not secured us a home. When asked why, he said he had met someone new and fallen in love with her. He had spend the last month and a half with her and her son. I had to borrow money  to get myself and children in a furnished rental home. Where we stayed for 2 months with everything we owned in a storage unit. We had no money for food. We had to go to food banks and rely on the kindness of others to sustain us until we could get jobs and permanent housing. He refused to help us with anything.  I made up my mind then that if there was ever a way I could pay it forward and help out others, men, women or children I would. He still rarely helps us but my children and I came out of it a much stronger family.<span>   </span>
</div><div>                                                       <b>The Turning Point</b>
</div><div>
<span>    The children and I spent several winters gathering wood and papers from dumpsters for our fireplace for warmth. We could not afford fuel for the furnace. I realized at that point how much paper products and cardboard that Amercians waste. I had also tried to start a candle company and had boxes of soy wax left. I would use the soy flakes to start our fires. Hence, the Deadbeat  Dad Logs were born! I came up with the idea for deadbeat dad logs because it is a fantastic way to recycle cardboard, leaves, twigs, and sawdust. And it is also a great fire starter. Plus, the deadbeat dad logs would help to provide jobs for the community  and raise money for a very worthy cause.  </span><br/>

<span>    The ingredients I use, are as I stated, recycled and organic.

We offer 3 different sizes: standard (large) sized fire logs, medium, and small. The medium and small sizes are ideal for camping, outdoor fire pits, or they make a great way to start a fire for your wood burning grill. We recommend the non scented logs for grilling. These are great for year round use. They also make charming one of a kind gifts! Or simply leave one out and use as a decorative potpourri!

We've sent out prototypes and have been given so much positive encouragement about our logs that we feel that we will be great a success. We are hoping, with your help, to make our dream come true so we can make brighter futures for those in need a reality. The funds we receive will be distributed in these areas: 1. A larger manufacturing space (unfortunately our garage isn't big enough) 2. Expand our employment (yay jobs!) 3. Buy supplies in greater volume... Soy wax in bulk, truck loads of sawdust, a large outdoor bin for kind folks to drop off their paper product trash so that we can recycle it into logs. 4. A wood chipper &amp; large commercial paper shredders.<span> 5. Commercial sized sized melting vat. 6. Safety equipment, such as safety glasses, gloves, and mask. 6. Web design etc. We also are using part of the funds to stage our product at the Atlanta Gift Mart.  </span>

<b>                                                  The Facts &amp; Plan</b> </div><div>    Statics show out of 11 million divorced fathers 7.2 million do not support their children. Although we are calling them dead beat dads does not negate the fact that dead beat moms exist as well. Therefore, we will help anyone we can with 100% of all our profits after taxes. Our dream is to finish opening our non profit charity and help families in need, not only financially but by networking within the community to help in all facets of their personal situation. We plan to help in every way to make it possible for families in need to get back on track.

We've sent out prototypes and have been given so much positive encouragement about our logs that we feel that we will be great a success. We are hoping, with your help, to make our dream come true so we can make brighter futures for those in need a reality. The funds we receive will be distributed in these areas: 1. A larger manufacturing space (unfortunately our garage isn't big enough) 2. Expand our employment (yay jobs!) 3. Buy supplies in greater volume... Soy wax in bulk, truck loads of sawdust, a large outdoor bin for kind folks to drop off their paper product trash so that we can recycle it into logs. 4. A wood chipper & large commercial paper shredders. 5. Commercial sized sized melting vat. 6. Safety equipment, such as safety glasses, gloves, and mask. 6. Web design etc. We also are using part of the funds to stage our product at the Atlanta Gift Mart.  
                                                     
                                                  The Facts & Plan     Statics show out of 11 million divorced fathers 7.2 million do not support their children. Although we are calling them dead beat dads does not negate the fact that dead beat moms exist as well. Therefore, we will help anyone we can with 100% of all our profits after taxes. Our dream is to finish opening our non profit charity and help families in need, not only financially but by networking within the community to help in all facets of their personal situation. We plan to help in every way to make it possible for families in need to get back on track. Check out urban.org for more info on family statics, and please visit cajuncandle.com and read about Eco-Soya. 
Please bare in mind that winter is around the corner and many will be without heat.
     My grandmother had a saying that I grew up hearing and never understood what it truly meant until late in my adult life. "" You only keep what you give away."" I've learned whether it is kindness, love, money, a smile...what you give away is all you keep in this life. So I am asking you now to help us give kindness, love, money and smiles to those in need. Kindness is magic. Kindness can change the world.  We would like to thank the following companies for their support:

<p>Blue Creek flows into the Klamath River 16 miles from the ocean, injecting it with a massive, life-saving dose of cold water. Because the Klamath is getting warmer every year, this first cold-water refuge that fish encounter on their journey inland from the sea is a lifeline. Without the cool-down period that Blue Creek provides, the Klamath’s fish would never make it to the upper river, where they spawn, die, return nutrients to the forest and begin the cycle of life anew. </p>

<p>The total cost of saving Blue
Creek is $60M. All but $12.8M of this has already been raised. We are now
looking to you to help bring this project to the finish line. We are hoping
raise $5M of the final $12.8M through crowdfunding, and the rest of it through
private fundraising and foundation giving. Given the cost of this project, it
is critical that we receive support from all fronts. </p>
<p><b>Are the Yurok good land
stewards?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Our partnership with the
Yurok is the only way we could see that Blue Creek would be fully and
unconditionally protected  as a sanctuary for salmon and steelhead. The
Yurok and WRC are creating a management plan that has as its centerpiece creating an
old-growth forest and salmon sanctuary in the entire Blue Creek
watershed.  The surrounding lands outside the Blue Creek watershed will
become part of a sustainable community
forest. The Yurok also have one of the largest
fisheries departments in California, and they are committed to the recovery and
enhancement of salmon and steelhead (it’s actually written in their
constitution).  </p>
<p><b>Is there any connection
between this project and the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement?</b></p>
<p>On the river, everything is
connected. But the Blue Creek Salmon Sanctuary is a freestanding effort and is
a safety net for fish that will help guarantee their survival regardless of
what happens elsewhere on the Klamath. This is especially true if the dams were
to never come out on the upper river.</p>
<p><b><b>How many river miles will this effort protect?</b></b></p>
<p>The effort will conserve 9 miles of Blue Creek, 25 miles of the main-stem Klamath River and 50 miles of cold-water tributary streams that flow into Blue Creek and the Klamath. In terms of Blue Creek specifically, the project will protect the entire lower Blue Creek watershed. The upper Blue Creek watershed is already protected within the Siskiyou Wilderness.<b><b> <br/></b></b></p>

will convey them to the Yurok Tribe, which
will then own and manage them for the sake of fish and wildlife, salmon
recovery and long-term forest health. 

How much has been raised for
the overall project to date?
The total cost of saving Blue
Creek is $60M. All but $12.8M of this has already been raised. We are now
looking to you to help bring this project to the finish line. We are hoping
raise $5M of the final $12.8M through crowdfunding, and the rest of it through
private fundraising and foundation giving. Given the cost of this project, it
is critical that we receive support from all fronts. 
Are the Yurok good land
stewards?
Yes. Our partnership with the
Yurok is the only way we could see that Blue Creek would be fully and
unconditionally protected  as a sanctuary for salmon and steelhead. The
Yurok and WRC are creating a management plan that has as its centerpiece creating an
old-growth forest and salmon sanctuary in the entire Blue Creek
watershed.  The surrounding lands outside the Blue Creek watershed will
become part of a sustainable community
forest. The Yurok also have one of the largest
fisheries departments in California, and they are committed to the recovery and
enhancement of salmon and steelhead (it’s actually written in their
constitution).  
Is there any connection
between this project and the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement?
On the river, everything is
connected. But the Blue Creek Salmon Sanctuary is a freestanding effort and is
a safety net for fish that will help guarantee their survival regardless of
what happens elsewhere on the Klamath. This is especially true if the dams were
to never come out on the upper river.
How many river miles will this effort protect?
The effort will conserve 9 miles of Blue Creek, 25 miles of the main-stem Klamath River and 50 miles of cold-water tributary streams that flow into Blue Creek and the Klamath. In terms of Blue Creek specifically, the project will protect the entire lower Blue Creek watershed. The upper Blue Creek watershed is already protected within the Siskiyou Wilderness.

<h1>Kwel hoy': We Draw the Line</h1>
<p>The burial grounds and treaty rights of the Lummi Nation are threatened by a proposal to build North America's largest coal terminal on their sacred landscape at Cherry Point (Xwe’chi’eXen.) If built, coal would be dumped on a historic burial site and would pollute the nearby fishing grounds. The Lummi community needs your help to stop this!</p>
<p>Cherry Point is a high bluff above the Salish Sea overlooking the San Juan Islands of Washington State. The waters below are home to one of the best crab fisheries along the coast and provide food for salmon and Orca whales. This fishery sustains many tribal families but those jobs would be lost if up to 55-million tons of coal is shipped over the waters.</p>
<p>And so the Lummi Nation has said 'no' to big coal. Lummi Councilman Jay Julius, in opposing the proposed coal port, has said <b><i>Kwel hoy’: “We draw the line.” </i></b>The sacred must be protected. Treaty rights must be honored. Kwel hoy’.<br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>The 'House of Tears' carvers of the Lummi community have created a tradition of carving and delivering totem poles to areas struck by disaster or otherwise in need of hope and healing.

<h4>The Full Story</h4>
<p>Xwe’chi’eXen (Cherry Point) is a sacred landscape in NW Washington that has deep spiritual and cultural significance to the people of the Lummi Nation. Overlooking the world-famous San Juan Islands, it includes ancient reef-net sites and a 3,500 year-old village site. The Hereditary Chief of the Lummi Nation, tsilixw (Bill James), describes it as the “home of the Ancient Ones.” It was the first site in Washington State to be listed on the Washington Heritage Register and is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p>Coal interests plan to construct North America's largest
coal export terminal on this site, above the ""home of the Ancient
Ones."" This proposal would haul 55-million tons of coal, from the Powder
River Basin of Wyoming and Montana, to this bluff overlooking the San Juans.
These long, heavy rail cars would travel through Montana, Idaho, eastern
Washington, up the Columbia River gorge and through Tacoma and Seattle to the
NW Washington coast. Once there, coal would be loaded onto some of the largest
bulk carriers in the world to ship the coal up the coast of British Columbia
and Alaska, to China.</p>
<p>Construction of this massive coal terminal will result in
significant, unavoidable, and unacceptable interference with Lummi Nation
burial grounds and treaty rights, and irreversible and irretrievable damage to
their traditional fishing waters and spiritual values.</p>
<p>Lummi Councilman Jay Julius, in opposing the proposed coal
port, has said <b><i>Kwel hoy’: “We draw the line.”</i></b> The sacred must be
protected. Treaty rights must be honored. Kwel

Updated on 29-11-2013 : The definitive legs of the stellarator have been designed, fabricated, assembled and validated. The central ring to accurately locate the 3D printed pieces has also been installed. Five new photos have been added to the Gallery !!. 
Next week a second 3D printed piece will be ordered!. 1/3 of the stellarator will be almost finished!!.
___________________________________ 
Updated on 22-11-2013 : One of the six marvellous 3D-PRINTED pieces has been received and initially assembled to other pieces received. Amazing photos and videos have been added to the Gallery !!. Soon more photos and videos!.
I would like to thank from the bottom of my heart to all the contributors, to all the people who is helping in spreading the word and with information and contacts.
___________________________________ 
I am the only person in the world who alone designed and built a stellarator (an amazing device to produce energy). See UST_1 stellarator in www.fusionvic.org. It was built in a garage using mostly second hand pieces from ebay, much work and some pocket money. Radical innovation was concocted to reduce 10 fold the usual cost.
I am a senior MS Engineer professionally working (now on leave of absence, no salary) in a public fusion energy research centre (CIEMAT) as fusion engineer. 
The stellarator type fusion devices need a complex twisted toroidal (Doughnut) shape surrounded by convoluted coils. Energy will be produced inside the device similarly to our beloved Sun produces the energy.  




   Photo, real stellarator device.                      Figure. Being built with your help !!!



Updated on 22-11-2013 : The amazing gorgeous 3D printed sector
of UST_2 just received and preliminarily assembled, ... and me !!. 




Updated on 29-11-2013 : Construction status of the stellarator. The central positioning ring and legs have just been installed. Accurate positioning has been obtained.

Aimed UST_2 stellarator

In the current UST_2 project a combination of three concepts will be applied to much reduce the cost: 3D printing, light enveloped truss structure, and moulding plaster into the envelope for strength. And much work!. The objective is to reduce the cost of fusion machines to produce cheap and clean energy !!. 
Simultaneously, 3D printing methods will be boosted and an appealing 3D-printed complex and accurate structure will be produced. Join the 3D printing revolution!!.
I need your help to buy the 3D printed pieces and other components.
                      


Cheap and clean energy for the world is an invaluable cause!. We are a lot of humans and growing, each one spends or wants to spend increasingly more energy, coal burning is growing in spite of the exponential development of renewable energies. Our environment cannot and will not allow it. Your contribution is important!.



 
What We Need
Very innovative fusion energy developments are uncommonly privately or publicly funded nowadays. That’s why I need your help.  
Donations will pay for:
- The 84 coil grooves distributed in six identical 3D-printed pieces, see Figure 1 above, 14 coils per piece. Six flat coils. 
- Other components: Vacuum fittings, dental plaster, copper sheet and tin solder for the vacuum vessel, bolts, the base and legs of the device, etc.
I spent only ~4000€ in all UST_1 facility, and ~3000 hours of work!. Again, I will work hard to build the device 10 times cheaper than usual !!!.
  
What You Get

- Acknowledgement in journal publication hardly would occur.
- If enough contributors, I will produce 1/6 or 1/3 of the torus (The torus is composed of 6 equal parts).

Then 1/3 of the funds surpassing the goal would be donated to other innovative projects aimed to the early availability of fusion energy or other clean energies, particularly such appearing in Indiegogo.
The remaining funds may allow manufacturing the vacuum vessel with stainless steel in a specialised company (If the goal is not surpassed I will solder copper sheets with Tin in my personal laboratory, much worse than a steel vacuum vessel).

Extra conditions and information on some perks:

<h3>Who I am:</h3>
<p>I grew up in and around Yosemite National Park, CA as an active outdoor adventurer and nature-lover.  I currently work in Yosemite Valley, and enjoy educating people about the environment. I am an avid artist (pen, graphite, watercolor media mainly), and an amateur biologist/conversationalist. </p>
<p> I have been accepted into an African penguin rehabilitation program in Cape Town, South Africa starting next April.  This non-profit organization gives people like me the opportunity to help birds in need, while also teaching significant leadership roles and conservation methods. These birds are currently on the endangered species list and need as much aid as they can get. After this program I will be going back to school to finish my Bachelor's degree in Science and continue to seek opportunities all over the world for conservation organizations.</p>
<p>Help me get there.</p>
<p><b>Why I'm Doing This Fundraiser:</b></p>
<p>The program fee is $1395, which includes housing costs, and donation to the program.  The travel expense is what I'm most concerned with, a roundtrip flight costs about the same, roughly $1400.  I have never traveled out of country before, and this trip will be life changing.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Let's Make it Happen:</h3>
<p>Every donation makes it possible for me to see South Africa and participate in a program that works hard to preserve an endangered species.  Not only will I be using this experience for educational purposes, I will be actively creating new works of art inspired by this change of scenery.  I will use my art and newly acquired knowledge to educate others about the importance of volunteer work and the impact every individual has on the world around them.</p></span></span></div>","Who I am:

</p><p><b>Aim:</b></p><p>The aim of this funding project is to provide
the 1500 inhabitants of Banana Island with the equipment and
necessary education to implement a sustainable lifestyle for the
future. <br/></p><p>The introduction of a waste management system and a
self-maintained permaculture site are two simple ways that will ensure the
preservation of the islands environment and provide a sustainable way
of life for the Banana Island community.</p><p><b>The Problem:</b></p><p>Over the last 3 years I have spent a substantial amount of time on 
Banana Island speaking with community leaders about the importance of 
sustainability and accountability when it comes to waste management. 
There is a general understanding of the problematic issues and a belief that something needs to change for the benefit of the youth, however there is not yet a solution or system in place that targets these issues. <br/></p><p>Being in a 
remote part of Indonesia the average wage for a working male is five 
dollars a day. This sort of income dampens innovation and the progression of the overall island society. When your main priority is to feed your family

the 1500 inhabitants of Banana Island with the equipment and
necessary education to implement a sustainable lifestyle for the
future. The introduction of a waste management system and a
self-maintained permaculture site are two simple ways that will ensure the
preservation of the islands environment and provide a sustainable way
of life for the Banana Island community.The Problem:Over the last 3 years I have spent a substantial amount of time on 
Banana Island speaking with community leaders about the importance of 
sustainability and accountability when it comes to waste management. 
There is a general understanding of the problematic issues and a belief that something needs to change for the benefit of the youth, however there is not yet a solution or system in place that targets these issues. Being in a 
remote part of Indonesia the average wage for a working male is five 
dollars a day. This sort of income dampens innovation and the progression of the overall island society. When your main priority is to feed your family
 on a day to day basis, the act of throwing your garbage on the beach to 
be washed away with the tide is an easy solution.

Welcome to the Algonquin Wildlife Research Station (AWRS)! It is here on the shores of Lake Sasajewun (native Algonquin tongue for little rapids)  where students and researchers have come to study the natural world, all creatures great and small, since 1944.
Nestled in the heart of Canada's famed Algonquin Park, the AWRS has been home to some of the world's most celebrated naturalists (e.g., Bruce Falls), accomplished researchers in biology and ecology (e.g., Robert MacArthur), and renowned artists (e.g., Robert Bateman). Tucked discretely between the towering pine trees are modest red and white cabins and lab spaces. They may not look like much, but they are called home by eager young minds.  
The gong has sounded as a reminder of meal time and at the rustic Cookhouse researchers are abuzz with their most recent wildlife observations and findings. How are pollinating insect communities faring in light of pesticide use? Are logging practices sustainable for forest birds, amphibians, and black bears? What can small mammal populations tell use about forest and ecosystem health? Are Algonquin wolves unique? Is fire a help or a hindrance to breeding bird communities? What does climate change mean for the seldom seen Spotted Salamander? How long do turtles live and what does this mean for the 7 of 8 Species At Risk turtles in Ontario? Here at the AWRS we are striving to learn more about the Science Behind Algonquin's Animals!






The AWRS had been renowned worldwide as one of the world's largest and most accomplished outdoor laboratories, affording the unique ability to study plants, animals, and the whole ecosystems in which they interact. With over 1000 peer-reviewed publications, hundreds of Master's theses, Doctoral theses, and Technical Reports, the AWRS has made invaluable contributions to our understanding of plants and wildlife in natural and human-impacted systems. International teams from across Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States have visited the AWRS to pursue research opportunities (and we are always looking for more partnerships!). At any given time the AWRS may host students working on a summer research positions,  graduate students undertaking thesis studies, and college and university students taking accredited field courses. 






The AWRS has assembled some of the most impressive long-term research datasets, critical to monitoring long-term changes from anthropogenic effects, like climate change, on small mammals (60+ years of study), turtles (40+ years of study), birds (50+ years of study), salamanders (10+ years of study), frogs and insects in Canada (with far reaching implications worldwide) and has done so on a very modest budget. Now our Station needs your help!


The Plight of Biological Field Research Stations In Canada

In recent years, biological field research stations in Canada have fallen on hard times (see articles in Canadian Geographic, and other media sources). Government support for environmental research has dwindled and so too has informed science-based policy and decision-making.
At the AWRS we think it is critically important that the public be engaged and understand the importance of ecological research. Among research stations, the AWRS has been innovative in running an annual Meet the Researcher Day and Meet the Researcher Weekend public education and outreach events to raise awareness of the importance of environmental research. The events have been an incredible success with over 600 attendees annually! We are now looking to reach a much larger audience through continued research at the AWRS!

What We NeedOwing to its age (70 years!), the AWRS has a rich history. Also as a result of age, the AWRS has rotting floorboards, leaky roofs (and a leaky dish sanitizer!), a testy stovetop, drafty windows, slumping staircases, and a shortage of outhouses. The basic infrastructure of the AWRS is aging - lab spaces, cabins, teaching portable - and in need of critical repair. The little field equipment that the AWRS has on reserve for students and researchers, namely our small fleet of canoes critical for  access to remote research sites within Algonquin Park, is in desperate need of rejuvenation.

<p><b>IMPORTANT STATISTICS: </b></p>
<p>By

minute shower the user will save 33% of water consumed per shower, which is
equivalent to approximately 10 Gallons per 12 minute shower. <b>Showers

on DOE and EPA calculators, installing US Innovations ClickClick product could <b>reduce
America’s CO2 emissions by 27 Million - 38 Million Tons per year, which is

<h3>The little actions that changed the world</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Federico García. I´m 24 years old and I'm from Montevideo, Uruguay. Montevideo is a capital city and, for this reason, produce a lot of trash per day. The people ignore it, but not all. Me and a group of six persons, all Fridays, go around Montevideo, principally in the ""Centro"" zone, the most populated area. In a white van, we try to collect trash that we can recycle. Why? Because if we don´t recycle a part of this trash, it goes to a dump that produce pollution and the contamination of the zone. This is a terrible future for our sons, and their sons. In fact we help the environment and help our self. </p>

<p>We collect Cardboard, bulbs, plastic, glass and a lot of things. A really famous company in Montevideo buys this and make crafts, but now this company is in bankruptcy and we try to make these products. These are the little actions that changed the world and for this we are very happy!</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>We need this, you need this</h3>
<p>We want to continue recycling and making the world a better place to live. For this, we need $700, or more. Why? We need equipment like bags, shovels, brooms and others. As well we need money to pay the transportation, because before we pay this with money that we earn selling the cardboard and plastic, but now we don´t have this money. Also we need money to buy materials like paint, brushes, pens and other artistic tools. Finally we want to rent a garage for all the trash, because actually is in the house of Emilia, one of the most important person in the team. It cost $150 per month. When we buy all of these things, we can sell our products in the different markets in Montevideo and earn money with this to continue our job. </p>

<p>We're the American Restoration Industry Research Group. We're a seasoned team of natural resource practitioners and academics from around the U.S. that care about the economic benefits of conserving and restoring natural ecosystems, especially when it comes to job creation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, environmental laws and conservation and restoration efforts are often associated with being bad for business, and bad for jobs. In fact, the American media and many members of the general public often believe that job creation will only occur by <strong><em>allowing more</em></strong> development and environmental impacts. </p>
<p><strong>We don't believe there needs to be a tradeoff. </strong></p>
<p>We want to understand the job creation associated with conservation, restoration and mitigation actions linked with industrial development – the activities of this relatively new industry we're calling the “Restoration Industry.” Think large-scale tree plantings and wetland restoration.  </p>
<p>Previous studies in the U.S. have identified ‘green job’ creation through renewable energy, energy efficiency, or recycling investments. However, the economic output of the jobs generated due to the conservation and restoration of natural ecosystems has not been systematically tallied. Attempts to date have been small-scale, focusing on a limited set of programs, specific projects, and individual funding sources. <strong>We’re aiming to change this. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We've already raised 75% of the funds we need - and we need your help to get us to 100%!</strong></p>
<p>In order to make our case we need support to conduct research and to communicate our findings to the right people through a national survey and outreach campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Our two main goals are to:</strong></p>
<p>1)  <em>  Create national awareness about restoration economy jobs.</em>  We will conduct outreach to our conservation partners, policymakers and others about the jobs (and ultimately the quality of those jobs) associated with conserving and restoring natural ecosystems.</p>
<p>2)    <em>Catalyze more public and private dollars flowing into the sector</em> to realize the significant economic activity, including jobs, associated with the restoration economy. </p>
<p><strong>Why the Indiegogo Campaign?</strong></p>
<p>With the $35,000 we hope to raise from this campaign we will be able to embark on the Phase II (outreach phase) of this project. We will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>Create an interactive website</strong></em> to host all of our research findings, maps, infographics, video testimonials and other resources for policy makers, media, conservation groups and the general public to access information and participate in discussions;</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Create powerful maps</strong></em> showing major Restoration Industry job locations around the country; and,</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Perform outreach</strong></em> to key players, including national conservation organizations, to share findings and promote effective dialogue through roundtable discussions to begin changing the debate.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have given ourselves the goal to have phase I of the project completed by fall 2014. This means that once we get through Phase I we need to move quickly to do outreach to engage key players in the restoration economy discussion.</p>
<p>We’re turning to our strongest supporters to ask for contributions. In exchange, we’re offering a number of perks, including polar bear, ocelot, bald eagle and penguin stuffed animals, wildlife notecards, and a tree planting (everyone who donates will get their name listed on our website). </p>
<p>Here's a little information about the tree plantings: The Conservation Fund has planted over 1 million trees at Upper Ouachita National Wildlife Refuge in northern Louisiana, where they are helping to restore the natural hydrology and historic floodplain of the Ouachita River. As these new trees grow, they will provide cleaner air, cleaner water and more room for the Louisiana black bear to roam.<br/></p>
<p>Note: please add $20 for orders shipped outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>The good news is we’ve already raised most of the funding we need for Phase I of the project through private foundation grants from the Walton Family Foundation, the blue moon fund, and The Conservation Fund, which is allowing us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><em>Cover the costs of an initial scoping study</em></strong> to create a working definition of the ‘American Restoration Industry’ and how many jobs are incorporated;</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Perform a literature review</em></strong>; and,</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Establish and implement a formal survey methodology</em></strong> to actors in the restoration economy and a write report of our current findings with key case studies.</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s really cool about Phase I is that it will result in a baseline that can be used in the future to assess the jobs associated with the restoration economy as it continues to evolve (and we believe, grow) over time.</p>
<p><em><strong>Your contribution will help us continue developing this innovative and groundbreaking methodology, spreading the word, and recognizing the incredible economic impacts of the restoration economy for existing and future jobs, and our planetary health.</strong></em></p>
<p>If you are involved in the restoration industry, we would also love to hear from you - we are looking for more research on jobs and economic impacts, so please send any information our way!</p>
<p>We’re also seeking “conventional” Foundation funding that will be used to help with the outreach phase of the project. Check back here at Indiegogo for updates on our progress with this!</p>

</div></div>","Our Story - we are GreenXC

We are an organization of young professionals in the fields of public relations, marketing, photography, journalism and business and we are LOVERS OF NATURE, TRAVEL AND ADVENTURE determined to make an impact on the preservation of our National Parks and Forests.

At the end of July, we are setting out on a three-week mission to get cross country using only ride-shares and conduct a national outreach and awareness campaign for parks and forests with the support of USDA National Forest Services. Stopping at various destinations along the way we will be documenting our travels and taking our followers along our journey through our website.


“National Parks are America's Best Idea; GreenXC's cross-country ride-share is a close second. It's a wonderful, simple and exciting idea to help save our National Parks. Can't wait to hear of your travels.”
–Eileen Novak


“It is important to keep forests standing. I hope this will help.”                                                   
-Monica


""You're doing more to help raise awareness with your campaign than us in natural resources management have in a long time. Thank u! You are reaching more people on a 1 to 1 level than most biologists.""
–Josh



We noticed that with  all the new technologies and social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter the people of our generation and younger are more glued to their computers and spend a lot more time indoors. This can prove hazardous to the future of National Parks and Forests, several of which are already endangered.We want to educate them on the beauty that is our National Parks and Forests and take the internet platforms that they frequent and have them come along a journey cross country that we will take via ride-shares. The reason we are selecting ride-share is so that we reduce our own carbon footprint and promote carpooling and
 sharing rides. As we go to each national park or forest, one of our 
team members is a professional travel photographer and writer so we will 
write about the parks and show video footage and imagery to get our 
readers/viewers excited. With each park we visit, people will be able to donate through out website directly to their national park or forest of choice. 100% of all donations made through our website will go to national parks and forests. The whole goal of this project is to 1.
 Promote Ridesharing/Carpooling to reduce the nation's carbon footprint 
2. Promote our National Parks and Forests to the younger generation 3. 
Raise money to be donated directly to the parks and forests 4. Tell the story of 
people we meet along the way and raise awareness for Green Businesses.

We will be doing this through our website, http://www.greenxc.com and through our social networks 
Twitter: @GreenXCountry and Facebook

The Impact


GreenXC
 seeks to address two major problems. 

As our nation’s deficit continues 
to grow, government funding for national parks and forests diminishes. With the 
increasing environmental risks threatening our parks and forests today, it is even 
more imperative to strengthen wildlife protection. Without sufficient 
funding, both parks and forests will be unable to sustain 
operations.

 
At
 the same time, the young generation has little awareness of the 
treasures contained in the national parks and forests and knows even less about the 
hardships they are facing. They are the driving force behind future 
social and political policies of our nation, and without their support, 
the outlook for protecting nature looks bleak.

To make an impact, we must tap into America’s young generation and work to instill in them the value of this cause.


What We Need & What You GetWe need everyone's help in raising money to get us cross country and make this campaign possible. The money we receive through indiegogo will be going to production and execution of this project (website, hosting, any additional production costs), money for gas for our ride-shares, food and lodging throughout our journey and entrance fee to get into the various parks we visit along the way. Any money 
left over will be donated directly to the National Forests and Parks.

Other Ways You Can Help
Can't help with donations at this moment? There are other ways you can help!

Share a Ride –  help us achieve our goal.

The success of GreenXC and the future of the National Parks and Forests is in 
your hands. For both to succeed we need you. Help us get to our nations
 parks and forests and across the country. Join us on our adventure and from our 
hard work and planning it is sure to be an exceptional time.

<p>This summer I am hoping to travel to Norway through the WWOOF (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms) to assist an agricultural, Norwegian couple farm their vegetable garden and also build a segment of their log house. I also will have the opportunity to share my music through small music/arts events that my Norwegian host-family provides at their home throughout the summer.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise the necessary finances to get a round-trip plane ticket and cover the essentials of what I’ll need when I’m there (food, transportation, etc.).</p>
<p>As many of you may know, I love to travel and also love to spread my music. I will have the opportunity to do both AND try something new, which is living and participating in farm work daily for 4 weeks. Each and every contribution helps, and will do SO much for my experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>80&amp; of the funding I receive will contribute toward my plane ticket and the remaining 20% will help cover the essential expenses – food, in country transportation, farming gear &amp; clothing, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My unique perk for contributors who give $100+ will be an original piano composition I write especially for them! I am looking forward to doing this very much!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the goal is reached, excellent! If it is exceeded, even more excellent! The surplus will assist me with the other essentials I'll need while in the country. </p>

<h3>Pollinators in Peril</h3>
<p>Pollinator species, (bees, butterflies, hummingbirds, and other native species), need our help. With varroa destructor mites, pesticides, weather extremes, habitat loss, and lack of food to forage on, pollinators are dying off at alarming rates. We've lost 90% of Monarch butterflies since 1996, the Rusty patched bumblebee is listed on the Endangered Species Act, and honeybee populations have declined about 40% each year for the last decade. This is especially concerning, considering that pollinators are responsible for fertilizing 1 in every 3 bites of food that we eat and are vital to both our food system and natural ecosystems. With urbanization and industrial farming, there are less and less flowers- especially native flowers- for pollinators to feed on. When pollinators do find flowers, they are usually ornamentals, which tend not to produce as much pollen and nectar, and they could be contaminated with toxic pesticides. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>You Can Help</h3>
<p>Providing more healthy, abundant wildflowers such as cosmos, milkweed, calendula, bachelors buttons, coneflowers, bergamot, phlox, sunflowers, clovers, fleabane, asters, beebalm, and many others, gives pollinators a buffet full of nutrition to boost their immune systems, protect them from pesticides, and gives us a colorful season-long show. Wildflowers are easy to manage, repel pests due to increased biodiversity, and are self-sufficient. They do not require reseeding, fertilizers, herbicides, or supplemental watering. Mowing them down once at the end of the growing season takes care of reseeding and saves on mowing costs for landowners.</p>
<p>The funds raised in this campaign will help provide wildflower seeds, tiller rental (if applicable), organic compost, and the labor necessary to plant the wildflowers, to businesses and organizations that accept the offer and generously give their land to help our pollinator species.</p>
<p>Alternatively, businesses on Main Street, or others without available land, could receive planter boxes with soil and seeds to establish wildflower gardens. Not to worry though, bees are very docile and do not seek to harm you, as they will die if they do. When looking for food, they have nothing to protect and just want to do their job. </p>
<p>If our goal is not completely met, we will establish as many pollinator gardens/meadows as funds allow.</p>
<p> </p>

</div></div>","A bid for some bird boxes... I love owls. I always have. I think Harry Potter made the world go ga-ga for these awesome birds, but from a young age, I've been inspired by their beauty. On one of our group wildflower sowing trips, I was lucky enough to spot a lone barn owl silently surfing across the fields at dusk. It sparked the idea to get up as many nest boxes as we can to encourage birds of prey into the area; hence this campaign was born.If you help us, you won't only be buying a nesting box; you'll actually be giving life to new owlets. Now, that's cool!  Even £2, the price of an ice cream on a hot day or a single morning coffee, will help immensely.


It all started last year when I crowdfunded the Wildflower Meadow Campaign. You see, I have these 40-ish acres of prime Suffolk farmland that have been left fairly vacant since my granddad died in the late 90s. So what did I decide to do? Use it as conservation space!
Help us get more boxes
March and April are prime-time for putting up owl boxes. Jackdaws have already made their nests, leaving the remaining boxes free for birds of prey. I've bought one which will go up in the next few weeks, but at £120 a pop, I can't afford any more for now. 


So...what do I need your help with? Buying more boxes.


Having talked with various owl sanctuaries, I've been advised I can put up two boxes per 5 - 7 acres. That's around 11 owl boxes in total - not to mention more boxes for kestrels and other wildlife. £500 will buy four boxes (I'm using these ECO Barn Owl Nest Boxes), and as long as I make the target, I can keep funding the campaign indefinitely, using further money to add all manner of homes for birds, bats and critters.
If I don't make the target...well, I'll just buy as many boxes as possible.

Perks
We've got various perks available, including thank you postcards and shout-outs on social media, but perhaps the most exciting will be updates on the boxes AND (fingers crossed) their inhabitants. You're not donating to have something made, you're making new life possible! Quite simply, one thing holding owl populations back is a lack of somewhere to breed. By funding new homes, you can offer life to little, cute, fluffy owlets (well, maybe not soo cute when they cannibalise each other - lets hope that doesn't happen).
I'll post pictures, videos and blogs on the boxes around Brimwood Farm and show you just how your pledge has helped the owls find somewhere to raise a family. The first visitors I expect are barn owls, but I hope to eventually encourage Britain's five owl species: 


Barn Owl
Tawny Owl
Little Owl
Short-eared Owl
Long-eared Owl

And, of course, the future is likely to include kestrels and other birds of prey too (when we were scything the wildflower meadow last year, a buzzard circled quietly above us).

(A short-eared owl; another species I hope to encourage. Image © gbrazzill)*It's important to note that I won't be interfering with the boxes once they're up. I'll work with a local and licensed trust who can legally inspect and ring any young birds. Most likely I'll be laying on my belly with a pair of binoculars for hours on end!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
We are a dedicated group of scientists, filmmakers, marketers and ocean loyalists who wish to preserve our precious oceans for future generations.</div>
<div>We believe we can make a huge impact on ocean conservation by developing a ""Ted-Talks"" style channel (<a href=""http://www.wildinblue.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.wildinblue.com</a>) that uses film and video to promote ocean preservation, education and restoration.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
We require this level of funding to build a fully-professional, large video-based website.</div>
<div>The technical requirements and attention to detail will be massive as we plan to be able to stream thousands, upon thousands of videos.</div>
<div>We fully plan to have a similar global reach like ""TED"", but exclusively ""ocean"".</div>
<div>If we don't receive full funding, our goal then will be to start with a smaller site to</div>
<div>attract larger donor interest and bulid from there.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We have lots of Wild In Blue Bling for those who help us reach our goal.</div>
<div>DVD's, CD's, T-Shirts, V.I.P. Film Festival Passes...and even (drum roll)</div>
<div>Executive Producer status!</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
No question; the ecological clock is ticking.</div>
<div>To quote Sylvia Earle...""Why should I care about the ocean? Because the ocean is the cornerstone of earths life support system. It holds most of life on earth. 97% of earth's water is there"". Wild In Blue will be a major motivator in keeping the all-important, ongoing conversation about our oceans alive.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here's the thing. We have aligned ourselves with scientists (non-muzzled) who want to tell the honest truth. The scientific community is usually several steps ahead of the media, so Wild In Blue will also become the default, ""go to"" ocean news channel.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Wild In Blue is a legacy project that will go on for many decades (if not several lifetimes) and will get everyone talking, caring, and working together to help protect this valuable treasure.</div>
<div>Become a Wild In Blue ambassador and help us change the world!</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Please help us spread the word. The more who know - the more we can impact magnificent change! You may know of ocean documentary filmmakers (worldwide) who wish to have a major platform to promote their message and films?

Wild In Blue is a legacy project that will go on for many decades (if not several lifetimes) and will get everyone talking, caring, and working together to help protect this valuable treasure.
Become a Wild In Blue ambassador and help us change the world!

Other Ways You Can Help
Please help us spread the word. The more who know - the more we can impact magnificent change! You may know of ocean documentary filmmakers (worldwide) who wish to have a major platform to promote their message and films? Perhaps you may have promotional or film idea for an ocean-related topic? As you can probably tell, we wish to build a fabulous ""ocean love"" community!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>FUTURE FORCE-young environmental heroes</h3>
<p>Way too many kids today feel frightened or powerless in the face of climate change and environmental problems, giving them bad dreams and a feeling of a future with no or little hope. This must end and we have an alternative!</p>
<p>By letting the kids meet real life superheroes, and become a part of their elite environmental superhero group, FUTURE FORCE, we will teach them how they can easily change many small things to create a more sustainable way of life for themselves, their families and their local communities.</p>
<p>At the same time, the kids will have fun, exploring their super-alter-ego, both online and in the real world, collaborating with others to truly change the world, while gathering FUTURE FORCE experience points for each heroic action they perform.</p>
<h3><b>Who are we?</b></h3>
<p>We are a group of professional physical actors and performing artists based in Copenhagen, Denmark. With over 10 years of experience working with interaction and action packed theatre for all ages, using both traditional theatre methods as well as multimedia and online presence, we have more than just the ideas to make this happen. We have the know how, the skills, the networks and most important of all, WE NEED TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN to empower kids to create the future they want to live in.</p>
<h3>3 X 3 months hard work have led us here</h3>
<p>During the past year, we, the 3 people who have instigated the project, have already done the equivalence of 3 months of full time voluntary work each, just to plan, meet the right people, write grant proposals and create the artistic background and ideas for FUTURE FORCE. </p>
<h3>Why we need your support</h3>
<p>We currently have EURO 65.000,- funding as well as support through scientific advice from the <a href=""http://www.mst.dk/English/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Danish Environmental Protection Agency</a>, making it possible for us to produce most of the performance, including set and props, but we do not have the funding for a key factor in this project: our online platform. This is where you come in. Thanks to your help, we will be able to hire 2 top notch programmers to work full-time for 3 months, creating the <i>secret</i> home-page, community and game that our young superheroes will use, both during our performance and into the future.</p>
<p>This is not possible without additional funding, since even artists and computer programmers need to pay their rent and feed their families :-). We are doing what we can to get support from other sources, but this is proving harder than we thought, so we hope that all the wonderful people out their in the virtual world might lend us a hand.</p>
<p>Through this project, everyone involved will truly have the possibility to make a huge difference for the future of us all.</p>
<h3>Not For Profit</h3>
<p>The project is run on a Not For Profit basis, so all funds go to cover production costs for the different aspects of the project. More about the project as a whole and how it's all going to work can be read at the end of this column.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>We need programmers</h3>
<p>Basically, to pay 2 people's wages for 3 months, while keeping in mind that they have to pay taxes in Denmark and pay Danish prices for food and livelihood, we find that the lowest acceptable wage per month is EURO 3.000,-, so we are asking for </p>
<p>2 people for 3 months at EURO 3.000,-/month, giving a total of EURO 18.000,-</p>
<p>Of course, we could do more with more, but our research has led us to the fact that the above can get us where we need to go.</p>
<h3>You get</h3>
<p>First of all, you get the chance to contribute to something that can actually make a real difference, from the ground up. After all, our children are our future. But we have some perks that we hope you'll like.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>1 EURO - Green Gratitude. Every cent counts!</li>
<li>10 EURO - Green Growth Gratitude. Every Euro counts!</li>
<li>25 EURO - Budding Hero. We'll send you a FUTURE FORCE logo badge and a hand written thank you letter, signed by the 5 superheroes. Each badge is different, made from recycled materials.</li>
<li>100 EURO - Future Superhero. We'll send you the same as in the 25 EURO perk, as well as a hand made superhero mask, made from recycled materials and make up a unique FUTURE FORCE superhero alter-ego for you.</li>
<li>500 EURO -  FUTURE FORCER. Within the online platform are a number of small games that teach about solar-power, the circulation of water on the planet and other important issues. You'll receive the perks from both the 25 and 100 EURO levels, as well as a download of all mini-games from the FUTURE FORCE platform.</li>
<li>1000 EURO - Super Green Supporter. You get all of the above perks, as well as a hand painted, specially designed FUTURE FORCE T-shirt, made just for you. The T-shirt will be organic and/or recycled and decorated with environmentally friendly colours.</li>
<li>10000 EURO - The Future is Green! You get all other perks, as well as an invitation to come to Denmark to visit us and see the general rehearsal for the performance. You get to couch-surf at one of the superheroes home and get a sumptuous, organic, home-cooked meal together with all the superheroes. This perk only applies to people within Europe, and we will pay your return train-trip from any European country. </li>
</ul>
<h3>What if...</h3>
<p>We don't reach the amount of funding we are aiming at?</p>
<p>In that case, we'll do the best we can with whatever we have. But if we do get just half way, we hope to be able to use this crowd-funding as leverage to get a sponsor or private grant to cover the rest of the expenses. One thing is for certain: we will work SUPER-HARD to make it happen.</p>
<p>We get more funding than we ask for?</p>
<p>This option would be fantastic. In that case, we will be able to put extra work-hours into the online platform, making it all the more SUPER-FANTASTIC. Also, we can make the whole experience even cooler, from the costumes, through the video production and the props. At the current moment, we have calculated with a budget that allows us very little, if any, slack, so any extra funding can only make things better.</p>

<h3>The Entire Concept. How FUTURE FORCE will work and develop in Denmark... </h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>One day, the kids arrive at school and when they enter their home classroom they find a <i>mystical</i> box standing in the middle of the room.</p>
<p>On the box are clues and riddles which, when solved, lead their way to a Youtube video protected by a password. The video leads to more riddles and clues which all serve to prepare the kids for the day when 5 superheroes visit their school.</p>
<p>
These 5, called FUTURE FORCE, turn the classroom into a temporary superhero-base for a couple of hours. This base is the center of an interactive experience with both physical performance, stunts, games and small environmental science workshops. in the course of theses hours, the base/classroom will be attacked by a super-villain and only the kids participation will ward of the danger.</p>
<p>At the end, they find out that the villain has escaped and will continue her attacks and that they are amongst the few who can stop her. Therefore, the 5 adult heroes make the whole class swear an oath to protect the planet against the villain and thus they all become new superheroes, the future of FUTURE FORCE. They all receive a password for an online forum, where they can track the villain and simultaneously work on one of 100 quests. The quests are divided into 10 levels and every time one quest is completed, the young heroes get closer to leveling up. The quests are both personal and group orientated and have to be completed either at home, in public space, alone, with others, with the family, in real life or online. Needless to say, everything is focused on learning how to live a more climate- and environmentally-friendly life. </p>
<p>Every performance is site-specific at a new school, letting us interact with kids in a place they know and feel at home in. Both the classroom and the school itself will be part of the experience, letting us move both indoors and outdoors, playing with and for the kids.</p>
<p>Our focus is on physical language, keeping spoken words at a simple level, whereby everyone can participate, regardless of their age, language and reading/writing skills.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>and beyond...</h3>We start by presenting the project in Danish schools in September - November 2014. The next step is an extended tour to even more Danish schools, while creating a complete documentation of the entire process, turning this into a Build Your Own Future Force ""kit"".<p></p>
<h3>Open Source interactive theatre-gaming-superhero-fun</h3>
<p>The ""kit"" will be available online for anyone to download, so that they can replicate or create like-minded projects. This includes the entire source-code for the online forum as well as the games and everything else we have created and come up with during the project. We will do our utmost to have it translated to as many languages as possible. We hope to make this possible some time during the first three months of 2015.</p>

Several abnormal conditions reduce the design fuel efficiency of the
cars being used, especially after a few years. 
This reduction can be as high as 60%, so emissions of a poorly
maintained car could be up to 60% higher than that of a car in good conditions,
or up to additional 6,000 pounds of carbon per poorly maintained car.  The most common conditions and the associated

<p>Generally, we think big paid political ad's are not the best use of money. But this is a special situation. We have held rallies, we have published hundreds of letters to the editor, we have collected thousands of petitions, we have met with our elected officials, we have organized call-in days…but Governor Kate Brown isn't listening. We all urgently need to ramp up our outreach to people in Portland, Salem, and the rest of the state.  This full-page ad in the Oregonians will reach thousands of new people. This ad is part of an intensified statewide campaign to make it clear that Kate Brown has a choice to make. <b>Will Gov. Brown stand up for climate action, clean energy jobs, property rights, and Oregon communities? Or will she stand with big corporate special interests? </b></p>

Help Stop Oregon from Becoming a Fossil Fuel Export Hub 
Out-of-state fossil fuel companies want to make Oregon a hub for fracked gas exports. Two LNG export proposals – the Oregon LNG project and the Jordan Cove LNG project – threaten our climate, rivers and salmon, existing jobs, private property owners, and the health and safety of rural communities. We need Governor Kate Brown to stand up for Oregon and say NO to LNG Exports, and we need her to do it now. A diverse coalition of community organizations, environmental groups, landowners, and more are going to run a full-page ad in the Oregonian on October 4 to publicize a statewide call-in day to the Governor's office on October 5.  We need to raise $10,585.86 by Oct. 3 to run the ad below in the Oregonian on Sunday Oct. 5.In addition to the amount listed the the right, we have an additional $1,350 that has come in through the mail! Thanks for all the support.
