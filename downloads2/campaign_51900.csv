It has always been important for me to showcase diversity in film. As Viola Davis stated in her riveting Emmy's acceptance speech ""The only thing that separates [PEOPLE] of color from anyone else is opportunity. You can not win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there.""Ok, so maybe our goal isn't to win an Emmy (YET!), but we do want to take matters into our own hands and let people know we don't always have to play stereotypical roles. We are actors; we can play anything! :) Not only are we displaying diversity in race, but diversity in gender roles as well. Think Thelma and Louise, but darker. We have a super small cast, but great suspenseful story featuring Leslie Lluvet (Cuban-American), Al Marchesi (Puerto Rican-Colombian-Italian-American), and me, Tensaye (Ethiopian-American).

opportunity. To George, it’s three hundred years of divine music. To the Butler,
it’s the very mark of prestige itself.

expensive violin.

celebration, he has opened his doors to an exclusive gathering of the social
elite. However, unbeknownst to George, three nefarious guests with their eyes
on the violin have been preparing for years, waiting for this opportunity.

Mongolian violin prodigy.
It’s the night of the Lipiński.                                          Last January, John brought Nate and Oliver a news story about a Stradivarius violin that had been stolen in Milwaukee.
The thief had apparently stalked the violinist for nearly a decade,
meticulously planning the theft.
Surprisingly, when push came to shove, the
thief decided to just stun the violinist with a Taser he had purchased from his
barber. Within eight days, he was in handcuffs.

<p>This story comes at a very important time in Cuban history. As Cuba is changing very rapidly, the possibility of the digitization of films that were almost impossible to share outside of Cuba, are now becoming available. It is important to preserve the work of those who have not been recognized as ""great Cuban filmmakers"", in the way that others have been recognized for their work.  In Cuba, director Gloria Rolando still struggles to find the support and funding to produce films that tell the stories of AfroCuban people. Although Sara Gomez was  first in many aspects, her work has been severely understudied in Cuba.  Less than half of her films are available to the general public.</p>
<p>The struggles that these women faced, and the art that they were able to create puts forth a way to see Cuba through new eyes.  <b>Unfortunately, since their films have not been able to impact the majority of Cuban people, or viewers outside the country, your contribution to this project will help reclaim their legacy. </b>Their stories are at risk of being lost if preservation and attention to their work does not happen immediately. Nuestra Cuba is our opportunity to reclaim the power of these film, and share the complexity, through their perspectives of the complexity of African heritage in Cuba. </p>

The participation of women in the filmmaking industry in Cuba continues to be a major issue, even years after the passing of Sara Gomez. This film seeks to bring light to an issue that could possibly spark positive change in the filmmaking industry, and more support for Cuban filmmakers like Gloria Rolando, who have amazing stories to tell, but lack the means or support to do so. The Nuestra Cuba project documentary project hopes to eventually assist in the digitization, and preservation of all works of Sara Gomez and Gloria Rolando.<b> Currently, the National Library in Havana, Cuba does not list the films of Gomez and Rolando.

Nuestra Cuba is a two part documentary series, directed by Amberly Alene Ellis, that reveals the role that black women film directors had in the development of a new Cuban cinema during two very different time periods in Cuban history. 


Sara Gomez Yera would become the first woman director in the Caribbean to direct a film at the Institute of Cuban Cinema (ICAIC). She would lead the institute in it’s courageous quest to create a truly unique and revolutionary cinema during the 1960s’ and 70s. Defying the challenges posed by her race and gender, the young filmmaker would utilize cinema for a powerful tool to critically access the new republic. At thirty years old, Gomez would die suddenly in the midst of her most respected work, De Cierta Manera. De Cierta Manera, or One Way or The Other, a feature length film that confronts issues of race, religion and gender roles in Cuba after the revolution.


Decades would pass before ICAIC would see another black or woman film director. In 1992, Director Gloria Rolando directed Oggun: An Eternal Presence, a film that tells the legend of Oggun and explores the roots of the presence of African deities in Cuba. In 1998 she would premiere ""Eyes of the Rainbow"", an intimate look at the life of Black Panther Assata Shakur, during her exile in Cuba. Though very different directors stylistically, both Gomez and Rolando have done extensive work on the documentation of Afro Cuban culture. Since 1959, Sara Gomez and Gloria Rolando have been the only AfroCuban women at ICAIC to direct film. Nuestra Cuba seeks to reclaim the importance of the lives and work of two women that dedicated so much to film history and to the idea that we can use cinema for social change.

It takes a lot of talented people and a multitude of unimaginable details to make the world we created on the page become a reality. It's a kind of magic, really; a hard-earned magic. And we want more of it in the Bay Area. Help us build a community of artists, and makers, and work with us to develop a thriving local film scene here. 
    Risks & Challenges Sure, there's always that worry — what if they don't make the film? Well, we're too close not to make it. We've invested too much already not to see this through to the end. We just need your help to put those last essential touches on it — to make this film as impactful and arresting as it can be.
The team behind Youth has experience completing projects and seeing them on to success. We've already brought multiple films to life to great acclaim, such as SLOMO, which premiered on the New York Times op-docs and screened all over the globe. The screenplay for our next project was shortlisted for the Sundance Lab. We have no doubt that Youth will garner similar attention and accolades.   Other Ways You Can Help:
For those of you who can't spare funding, there are so many other ways to help if you believe in this project:— Spread the word the old fashioned way: tell your friends, family, grandparents, great-grandparents, partners, lovers, dog walkers, favorite baristas, frenemies, casual acquaintances, everyone and anyone. Heck, tell a stranger. Start a conversation and make a new friend.— Spread the word the new-fashioned way: share this post on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, whatever new social media platform the kids are into these days. Like it, tweet it, poke it, snap it, heart it. Get it out there into the ether!And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>""Venture Falls"" is a comedy that encompasses realistic events as it follows the lives of three teenagers as they begin work at a rundown pirate themed amusement park called Venture Falls.

</p><h3><b>Our Project</b></h3>
<p><i>Kensington Market: The FIRST 150 Years </i> is a feature documentary that will tell the 150 year story
of Toronto’s Kensington Market.  Its the story of the many lives of the market village, as its grown and been re-envisioned through the decades.</p><p>We will share  stories of the generations who have lived here in the past, those that live here today and explore the
forces that are impacting the Market’s future.</p>
<p>Kensington Market has long been one of the
most unique neighbourhoods in Toronto, in Canada, and in fact – the world.  Over the years, this six-block market in
Toronto’s downtown core has been a harbour of safety for new immigrants to
Canada from Jewish, Portuguese, Caribbean, Eastern European and Asian
communities.  For many, Kensington is the first step in their journey to Canada.</p>
<p>Today, Kensington is a delightful,
colourful alternative to the skyscraper-draped metropolis that is growing up
around it. Despite its numerous incarnations, the market manages to hold onto
its uniquely eclectic charm and free-spirited nature, but, as always, the
times are changing.</p>
<p>We are inspired to make this film now, as

<h3><b>Project Needs and How You Can Help</b></h3>
<p>Raising our fundraising goal of $12,000 will
allow us to invest in shooting interviews and events.  Costs include renting equipment and paying modest production crew fees for shooting days.  Your sponsorship helps us pay for the first phase
of the film’s production.  Funds will also cover archival research and image
capture so we can bring to life images that span over 150 years of Market
history. </p>
<p>This phase of fundraising
will go a long way towards ensuring this documentary will complete production
and allow us to show future funders material to secure post production
resources.</p>
<p>In addition to financial support, we also
invite you to join us in other ways. </p>
<p>If you have roots in the market, or a
special tie to it that you think is worth sharing, we’d love to hear your
story.  We are looking for archival film,
video and photos, video and other materials that show the different eras of the
market.  Please email us at
Kensington150@gmail.com </p>
<p>We want this project to be the best it can
be. We want it to be something the community can truly be proud of and connect
to – but we can’t do it alone. </p>
<p>Every dollar you provide brings us closer to completing the film and helping us share it for generations to come. We’re
grateful for all support and any help is greatly welcomed and appreciated.  Please check out our perks to see the Kensington inspired gifts we’ve set aside for you. </p>
<p>Thank you fellow Kensington supporters!  We look forward to sharing our stories of
Kensington with you soon!</p>

Kensington Market: The FIRST 150 Years  is a feature documentary that will tell the 150 year story
of Toronto’s Kensington Market.  Its the story of the many lives of the market village, as its grown and been re-envisioned through the decades.We will share  stories of the generations who have lived here in the past, those that live here today and explore the
forces that are impacting the Market’s future.
Kensington Market has long been one of the
most unique neighbourhoods in Toronto, in Canada, and in fact – the world.  Over the years, this six-block market in
Toronto’s downtown core has been a harbour of safety for new immigrants to
Canada from Jewish, Portuguese, Caribbean, Eastern European and Asian
communities.  For many, Kensington is the first step in their journey to Canada.
Today, Kensington is a delightful,
colourful alternative to the skyscraper-draped metropolis that is growing up
around it. Despite its numerous incarnations, the market manages to hold onto
its uniquely eclectic charm and free-spirited nature, but, as always, the
times are changing.
We are inspired to make this film now, as
the market is in the crossroads between what it has been and what it will
become.  Every month, a heritage
business leaves the market. Some of the oldest members of the community are passing on and now is the time to capture their stories so we can share them into the future.  And its an amazingly rich story, from all over the globe, a story of community and creativity.The newest arrivals in the
neighbourhood are not arriving with a single suitcase - but come in construction
cranes and high-rise condo towers.  The market is again facing a state of change and who knows where it will take it. We
want to capture the personality and colour of the Market now as we know it and love
it, and share some of the magic for the whole community to share and cherish. 
The film includes interviews, archival
material, community activities and events. Most of all, it will include the people, arts and
personalities of Kensington Market.

<h1>2. What makes Nya so different from other short films on Indie Gogo?</h1>
<div>Nya comes from a place of personal experience as a father and husband. The character Jamaal is not a direct reflection of me, but small elements such as the need to have a voice in a busy world can be challenging?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<h1>3. Where did the idea come from?</h1>
<div>It came from my three year old daughter, Tatianna. Her energy was enough to ignite my pen to begin the process.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h1>4. What do you plan to do wit  the film once it gets filmed in June?</h1>
<div>Once the film has been edited, color graded and sound design completed, we will have a private screening for cast and crew and submit Nya to as many film festivals as possible, from Sundance to Savannah Film Festivals to Cannes. I believe this is a film worthy of many awards.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h1>5.What's in it for your donors?</h1>
<div>We have various rewards based on Indie Gogo page. We hope our community can feel accomplished in helping launch the beginning careers of young passionate filmmakers right here in Savannah, Georgia.</div>

<h1>6.What's the closest film that Nya would come close to looking similar to?</h1>
<div>I have always been a fan of science fiction so I would say Super 8, Anomaly and The Sixth Sense are several films. Anything from Steven Spielburg would be on top of that list. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<h1>7.Why is the budget so expensive?</h1>
<div>Film making costs money! If you want a phenomenal creation, you have to make a sacrifice. </div>
<div>
<h1><br/></h1>
<h1>8. What exactly is the visual effects budget being used for?</h1>
<div>When you create a film that has any kind of visual effects, such as flying ships, planets that rotate or place an actor in front of a green screen and change a background, you have to spend money on rendering. This requires a render farm. A render farm is a data storage that allows you to transfer information in a way that will allow large files created in an VFX program to mesh well with your live action film. </div>
<br/>
</div>
<h1>9.What is the moral theme of the story?</h1>
<div>Love requires sacrifice. Elora becomes elusive through the help of Nya in order to ""wake"" her parents up and awaken them from their individual selfishness.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h1>10. What do you want your audience to walk away from if your vision comes to life?</h1>
<div>I hope my audience can walk away fulfilled and enthralled at the same time. It is rare to see a fantasy or science fiction drama film casted with African-american actors that display real emotion and depth. I try to stay from cliche characters. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<h1>11. Why were you rolling your eyes in your campaign video?</h1>
<div>I was very tired! I work three jobs plus I have a marriage, two girls and a newborn on the way this July! I am passionate about life and film so if I look uninterested in the video, please forgive me!</div>

</div></div>","IS A FANTASY-DRAMA SHORT FILM ABOUT A STORY OF HOPE AND LOVE.




Set in the early 2000s, the story centers around Elora, a beautiful 7-year old African-American girl that has a fascination with space. She wants to be an astronaut when she grows but there's one problem: her parents. Her dad and mom fight everyday, completely ignoring Elora. Nya, her teddy bear, has been her best friend and soon the two embark on a journey in outer space that forever changes the course of history. 











These are stills from films that show you the type of visual style and color we are going for:
















is a special teddy bear that finds a way to restore happiness in a broken home.



Here are some sketches that give you an idea of the visual look of our project. Big thanks to our concept artist, Christopher Brown!
http://www.cbillustration.com











Marley Battle ( as Elora) 
 Marley stars as our beautiful little astronaut that has a love for science and exploration. She sees light ""differently"" from most kids her age and travels space with Nya to escape the harsh realities of her home.
https://www.instagram.com/marley_the_natural/?h...






Yakini Horn (as Ebony) 
Yakini has a close relationship with her daughter, Elora but often times she is caught up in her own past regrets that she often overlooks her daughter's ambitions as an astronaut. She deeply loves her husband and though she is aware of his secret infidelities, she still loves him..

http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4414128/






Walter Colson (as Jamaal) 
Walter often struggles with loving his family and reliving his glory days as a single man. He cares about his wife and daughter but often times his own selfishness gets in the way. He soon learns that his daughter is more special to him than he realizes.


http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2116917/?ref_=fn_al_...







1. If funded, were will my donation go?






2. What makes Nya so different from other short films on Indie Gogo?
Nya comes from a place of personal experience as a father and husband. The character Jamaal is not a direct reflection of me, but small elements such as the need to have a voice in a busy world can be challenging?


3. Where did the idea come from?
It came from my three year old daughter, Tatianna. Her energy was enough to ignite my pen to begin the process.

4. What do you plan to do wit  the film once it gets filmed in June?
Once the film has been edited, color graded and sound design completed, we will have a private screening for cast and crew and submit Nya to as many film festivals as possible, from Sundance to Savannah Film Festivals to Cannes. I believe this is a film worthy of many awards.

5.What's in it for your donors?
We have various rewards based on Indie Gogo page. We hope our community can feel accomplished in helping launch the beginning careers of young passionate filmmakers right here in Savannah, Georgia.

6.What's the closest film that Nya would come close to looking similar to?
I have always been a fan of science fiction so I would say Super 8, Anomaly and The Sixth Sense are several films. Anything from Steven Spielburg would be on top of that list. 

7.Why is the budget so expensive?
Film making costs money! If you want a phenomenal creation, you have to make a sacrifice. 


8. What exactly is the visual effects budget being used for?
When you create a film that has any kind of visual effects, such as flying ships, planets that rotate or place an actor in front of a green screen and change a background, you have to spend money on rendering. This requires a render farm. A render farm is a data storage that allows you to transfer information in a way that will allow large files created in an VFX program to mesh well with your live action film. 


9.What is the moral theme of the story?
Love requires sacrifice. Elora becomes elusive through the help of Nya in order to ""wake"" her parents up and awaken them from their individual selfishness.

10. What do you want your audience to walk away from if your vision comes to life?
I hope my audience can walk away fulfilled and enthralled at the same time. It is rare to see a fantasy or science fiction drama film casted with African-american actors that display real emotion and depth. I try to stay from cliche characters. 

11. Why were you rolling your eyes in your campaign video?
I was very tired! I work three jobs plus I have a marriage, two girls and a newborn on the way this July! I am passionate about life and film so if I look uninterested in the video, please forgive me!

<h3>What is ""The Miscarriage of Justice"" Project?</h3>
<p><span>In late 2014, I read
an article about a gentleman by the name of Kirk Odom. I was absolutely floored
as I read it. The story, though it was one that spoke of a dark and flawed
American Justice system, was one of victory: how one man, even in times of hopelessness,
came out a survivor. This
prompted me to further research the issue of Wrongful Convictions among
minorities within the US; the results were <b>alarming</b>, many of which I was unaware. Through this film, we expose
the agenda and lack of due processes used in most wrongful conviction cases, and
shed light on agencies and organizations committed to getting such cases reopened for the chance of exoneration. T</span>he untold stories of these men who have been displaced and robbed of
their livelihoods, families and futures should not be silenced by those who have disregarded them as just another statistic.</p>

Documentary Synopsis


The Miscarriage of Justice Project is
a gritty documentary that spotlights the cover-ups and hidden truths behind our nation’s 63% minority conviction rate through background details, interviews, expert analysis, and associated facts related to the cases of several victims of
wrongful convictions; some freed while others still incarcerated. The subjects featured in this film demonstrate victory, triumph and moments of
hopelessness all while still fighting for their freedom, adjusting to life after
exoneration and giving
hope to others in similar circumstances. Miscarriage of Justice gives you a firsthand
look into the grey area of the justice system through the use of statistics and
interviews, told through the eyes of several distinct cases:

 
Kirk Odom: Whose case received
national attention for his 2012 DNA Exoneration, after serving 22 years in
prison and 9 years paroled as a registered sex offender, for a wrongful rape
conviction I 1981. After being excommunicated from his family, suffering
from depression, and making several unsuccessful attempts at suicide, Kirk was
sexually abused and contracted HIV as a result of the abuse. His tale, of
triumph in the face of adversity, is one that gives us all hope.




DaVontae Sanford: The partially
blind and developmentally disabled adolescent who was being falsely convicted
of quadruple murder in 2007 at the young age of 14. Though
the actual assailant, self-proclaimed hit-man Vincent Smothers, was captured
and confessed to those and other murders around the country, the Wayne County
Circuit Court refused to allow Sanford to withdraw his guilty plea for an
innocent plea due to his already entered ""admitted confession"". This case like
so many others, hides behind falsified information and withheld evidence. Now
23, DeVontae is still in custody, serving a 37-90 year sentence and in need of
a voice.  He hopes to one day have a chance
a normal life outside of prison bars.



Ricky Jackson: Was just
an adolescent teen when he and 2 of his friends were wrongfully accused and
convicted of murder of a store owner in Cleveland, OH. Ricky's case gained
greater national attention as the National Registry of Exonerations has labeled
him as serving the longest sentence (39 years) of anyone exonerated on Wrongful
Conviction charges. Awarded only 2 million dollars for ""lost time,""
he continues to fight on behalf of those still weathering the Wrongful
Conviction storm, by petitioning officials to revise the inadequate regulations
that prevent (wrongful) convicted cases from being reexamined and retried. Ricky
has gone as far as publicly confronting Democratic Presidential Candidate
Hilary Clinton during her campaign visit to Ohio.

These individuals, and
others featured in this film, have been robbed of their lives
through an unjust justice system. These men never had the opportunity
to attend college, date, start a family, choose and work in a career they love,
fall in love, or even impel things like buy their first car. Had justice truly
been carried out, these men would have lived their lives and experienced all
the ups and downs everyone goes through, rather than wasted away in a cell for
a crime they did not commit.
  

There is a NEED

The Miscarriage of Justice came as a result of my direct involvement with community organizations that involve both social and systematic reform. All those participating in the making of this project are social activists, and have a passion to bring about social change on a global scale. I am known for getting things done, with a team or on my own, but this is a large task for any one man. Real change really does take a village!

<p>Marina
 just wants to have that someone.  <br/>Marina wants to be accepted.  <br/>Marina

<p>The video is set in 1988 and not just for

 shift in the way we are communicating which has had a huge effect

<div>I've been a painter seriously since around 1999 and since 2000 I have been desiring to make an updated version of the legendary art documentary PAINTERS PAINTING. In 2011 I began that long and winding road, it has lead me here with 28 interviews being conducted and am hoping with your help I'll be able to make it to 29, 30, 31, 32 and so on. I want to be able to compile interviews with great people so future generations can get to know the people I have been honored to interview.</div>
<div>I've been so infatuated with this project for a decade and am so glad to see it grow way beyond my original idea of making one film. I now have over 100 hours of film on many great artists, writers, and curators. I've been blessed to get to know these people and hope that, through my filming, you will be able to get to know them too. </div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm using this campaign to raise funds for travel, lodging, and food while on my next filming journey. I already have all the electronics I am going to need for this project, and all I need is your support to get there and get it done. </p>
<p>Travel to NYC by car is 9.5 hours roughly to get to NYC, to get IN NYC it takes another 10-30 minutes depending on the traffic at the tunnel. If you've driven into NYC you know what I mean. I am usually able to stay with friends, which significantly cuts down on production costs, which is why i've been able to make so many interviews over the years on the cheap. Everytime I do one of these filming trips, I spend a lot of time walking around and am now also in need of a new camera equipment bag, which will be around $200. Subways are wonderful for me and a 7 day pass is around $30. I always buy a 7 day pass, even if i'm there for three, as you put in a $20 and you'll run through that in one day if you are a busy person. I have usually been blessed to eat a few meals with the kindness of friends, but can't depend on things like that or you'll starve. </p>
<p>When you buy a DVD of one of the interviews, that money will go toward helping me do the above in order to get the world another interview with another great artist, along with allowing me to survive while there.</p>
<p>I'm also working on getting the archives of these interviews into some university libraries around the country. Hopefully one day, the world. But until that happens, please keep the positive thoughts coming. It would be awesome for a young student to come upon these interviews, like I did with PAINTERS PAINTING and have it change their life as that film did for me.</p>
<p>If the goal of this project is not realized, the funds still go through, this is a flex-funding campaign, so unlike that other crowdsourcing site, this one allows all funds to be allocated toward getting as much done as I can with what I raise. So please do share this with your friends and family so everything will work out amazingly.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>To have an archive of interviews from some of the world's greatest artists of this era is indispensable to art history. One day I hope that the entire archive will be available at any local art university library, but until then, you can have a piece of it for yourself in the building of this mountain. </p>
<p>I've done these campaigns before and many people have helped me get to where I am, I hope that they will again be willing to lend their help to this project to make it a reality.</p>
<p>There are not many people out there doing interviews like this, but there are more now than ever, people are using their cameraphones to do interviews with and in return are building a  worldwide archive of stories of artists like never before seen.</p>

</div><div>
<div>Those of you who know me, know how important this filming project has been, it's got even more important when I decided to do separate interviews of all kinds of art world personalities. As trying to bring everyone together in a massive 10 hour film, I am now looking to gain enough footage to put together 1 hour programs on each of these artists and writers, critics, and curators.</div>
<div>I've done this trip to NYC to interview many times and look forward to doing another few trips. I doubt I have much more to accomplish in NY before I feel i've done enough. I will then pass the torch to another generation and I will focus on the next place. Probably Los Angeles or Europe. </div>

I've been making documentary films on artists since 2012 when I made my first filming trip to New Hampshire to interview the great curator Carl Belz, since then I have interviewed 28 artist and art world personalities, and I want to go back to New York City to interview more.




I've been a painter seriously since around 1999 and since 2000 I have been desiring to make an updated version of the legendary art documentary PAINTERS PAINTING. In 2011 I began that long and winding road, it has lead me here with 28 interviews being conducted and am hoping with your help I'll be able to make it to 29, 30, 31, 32 and so on. I want to be able to compile interviews with great people so future generations can get to know the people I have been honored to interview.
I've been so infatuated with this project for a decade and am so glad to see it grow way beyond my original idea of making one film. I now have over 100 hours of film on many great artists, writers, and curators. I've been blessed to get to know these people and hope that, through my filming, you will be able to get to know them too. 
This campaign is here to help build this archive that will guide future generations.
Listing of every participant: Anders Knutsson, Art Guerra, Carl Belz, Darryl Hughto, Dee Solin, Francine Tint, Forrest Myers, James Panero, John Zinsser, Karen Wilkin, Klaus Kertess, Liv Mette Larsen, Loren Munk, Louise P. Sloane, Matthew Deleget, Michael Brennan, Peter Reginato, Richard Timperio, Robert C. Morgan, Robert Sagerman, Rodney Dickson, Ronnie Landfield, Ruth Ann Fredenthal, Sandi Slone, Seren Morey, Stephen Bennett, Susan Roth, and Vincent Como.   
What We Need & What You Get
I'm using this campaign to raise funds for travel, lodging, and food while on my next filming journey. I already have all the electronics I am going to need for this project, and all I need is your support to get there and get it done. 
Travel to NYC by car is 9.5 hours roughly to get to NYC, to get IN NYC it takes another 10-30 minutes depending on the traffic at the tunnel. If you've driven into NYC you know what I mean. I am usually able to stay with friends, which significantly cuts down on production costs, which is why i've been able to make so many interviews over the years on the cheap. Everytime I do one of these filming trips, I spend a lot of time walking around and am now also in need of a new camera equipment bag, which will be around $200. Subways are wonderful for me and a 7 day pass is around $30. I always buy a 7 day pass, even if i'm there for three, as you put in a $20 and you'll run through that in one day if you are a busy person. I have usually been blessed to eat a few meals with the kindness of friends, but can't depend on things like that or you'll starve. 
When you buy a DVD of one of the interviews, that money will go toward helping me do the above in order to get the world another interview with another great artist, along with allowing me to survive while there.
I'm also working on getting the archives of these interviews into some university libraries around the country. Hopefully one day, the world. But until that happens, please keep the positive thoughts coming. It would be awesome for a young student to come upon these interviews, like I did with PAINTERS PAINTING and have it change their life as that film did for me.
If the goal of this project is not realized, the funds still go through, this is a flex-funding campaign, so unlike that other crowdsourcing site, this one allows all funds to be allocated toward getting as much done as I can with what I raise. So please do share this with your friends and family so everything will work out amazingly.
    
The Impact
To have an archive of interviews from some of the world's greatest artists of this era is indispensable to art history. One day I hope that the entire archive will be available at any local art university library, but until then, you can have a piece of it for yourself in the building of this mountain. 
I've done these campaigns before and many people have helped me get to where I am, I hope that they will again be willing to lend their help to this project to make it a reality.
There are not many people out there doing interviews like this, but there are more now than ever, people are using their cameraphones to do interviews with and in return are building a  worldwide archive of stories of artists like never before seen.

Risks & Challenges

Those of you who know me, know how important this filming project has been, it's got even more important when I decided to do separate interviews of all kinds of art world personalities. As trying to bring everyone together in a massive 10 hour film, I am now looking to gain enough footage to put together 1 hour programs on each of these artists and writers, critics, and curators.
I've done this trip to NYC to interview many times and look forward to doing another few trips. I doubt I have much more to accomplish in NY before I feel i've done enough. I will then pass the torch to another generation and I will focus on the next place. Probably Los Angeles or Europe. 
    
Here's how to keep helping!
If you can't contribute by way of monetary value, you can always help by simply sharing this campaign with your family and friends. We need all the help we can get....am I right? 
The easy to use sharing tools from indiegogo allow anyone to put it on their blog, or Twitter feed, or even your Facebook feed.
Thanks very much for your help, I am a very grateful filmmaker.",1.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>We have never met a better group of story-tellers than the men known as <i>The Gentlemen Smugglers</i>.  Perhaps it’s due to their time on sailboats crossing the Atlantic, bails of weed covering every available square inch of the vessel.  When you are sailing back from Jamaica, Colombia, even Lebanon you have weeks to share stories and you certainly have a treasure chest of material to pull from.  I’m sure those stories were refined in prison.  Instead of blue water on the horizon they have only time to navigate - time to share adventures about money earned and lost, about friends turned snitches, and about women that stuck by them when all signs seemed to point to run.<br/><br/><i>The Gentlemen Smugglers</i> built a multi-million dollar marijuana empire over the course of a decade, living by their own moral code. They shunned violence, enlisted friends, and perfected the art of enjoying the scam. Most were from the south, and strangers to the lifestyle the smuggling operation suddenly afforded them. Some opted to hide the money and live quietly, but most did not. They lived large and enjoyed the fruits of their marijuana labor.  <br/><br/>But while the party raged down south, the foot soldiers in President Reagan’s War on Drugs quietly targeted <i>The Gentlemen Smugglers</i> in a task force they coined “Operation Jackpot.”  The government saw marijuana as the gateway drug to an exploding crack cocaine epidemic, and was determined to bring down the southern dealers. Meanwhile, the smugglers went about their business, following their own ethical standards, with a less fatalistic view of weed. Said Gentlemen Smuggler Kingpin Les Riley,  “I only saw marijuana as a way of having a good time and getting hungry.”  </p>
<p>The smugglers were not an easy bunch to capture. Some were on the run for years, and others were caught, but managed to escape on multiple occasions. When the decade-long party finally ended, friends betrayed friends, families were torn apart, and sailboats on the open water were traded for prison cells.<br/><br/>While the “who and what” of this story is fascinating, it’s the smugglers themselves that make the documentary necessary.  They are naturally gifted storytellers who overcame odds, made a mark on history, and became legends. Our goal as filmmakers is to make the story as colorful and rich as the people who lived it.  The Gentlemen Smugglers are finally ready to tell their version of history. </p>

</div></div>","AS THE END OF MARIJUANA PROHIBITION COMES INTO FOCUS, WE NEED YOUR HELP TO TELL THIS INCREDIBLE STORY.

BASED ON THE WALL STREET JOURNAL BEST SELLING BOOK 'JACKPOT'
This isn’t a story of hit men, mobsters, cocaine cowboys or cartels. The Gentlemen Smugglers built a multi-million dollar marijuana smuggling empire over the course of a decade, living by their own moral code. They shunned violence, enlisted their friends, and perfected the art of enjoying the scam.  As the operation grew beyond the smuggler’s wildest dreams, the foot soldiers in President Reagan’s War on Drugs quietly set their sites on the outlaw sailors. The government saw marijuana as the gateway drug to an exploding crack cocaine problem. The Gentlemen Smugglers, and presently the majority of this country, couldn’t disagree more.  With a zest for life and a healthy sense of humor, the smugglers rewrote the rulebook on marijuana trafficking. Based on the Wall Street Journal best selling book 'JACKPOT' by Jason Ryan.




A MESSAGE FROM OUR DIRECTOR
We have never met a better group of story-tellers than the men known as The Gentlemen Smugglers.  Perhaps it’s due to their time on sailboats crossing the Atlantic, bails of weed covering every available square inch of the vessel.  When you are sailing back from Jamaica, Colombia, even Lebanon you have weeks to share stories and you certainly have a treasure chest of material to pull from.  I’m sure those stories were refined in prison.  Instead of blue water on the horizon they have only time to navigate - time to share adventures about money earned and lost, about friends turned snitches, and about women that stuck by them when all signs seemed to point to run.The Gentlemen Smugglers built a multi-million dollar marijuana empire over the course of a decade, living by their own moral code. They shunned violence, enlisted friends, and perfected the art of enjoying the scam. Most were from the south, and strangers to the lifestyle the smuggling operation suddenly afforded them. Some opted to hide the money and live quietly, but most did not. They lived large and enjoyed the fruits of their marijuana labor.  But while the party raged down south, the foot soldiers in President Reagan’s War on Drugs quietly targeted The Gentlemen Smugglers in a task force they coined “Operation Jackpot.”  The government saw marijuana as the gateway drug to an exploding crack cocaine epidemic, and was determined to bring down the southern dealers. Meanwhile, the smugglers went about their business, following their own ethical standards, with a less fatalistic view of weed. Said Gentlemen Smuggler Kingpin Les Riley,  “I only saw marijuana as a way of having a good time and getting hungry.”  
The smugglers were not an easy bunch to capture. Some were on the run for years, and others were caught, but managed to escape on multiple occasions. When the decade-long party finally ended, friends betrayed friends, families were torn apart, and sailboats on the open water were traded for prison cells.While the “who and what” of this story is fascinating, it’s the smugglers themselves that make the documentary necessary.  They are naturally gifted storytellers who overcame odds, made a mark on history, and became legends. Our goal as filmmakers is to make the story as colorful and rich as the people who lived it.  The Gentlemen Smugglers are finally ready to tell their version of history. 
~ Director Tony Wise



WE NEED YOUR HELP. PLEASE JOIN OUR TEAM!
We are seeking financial support to produce an incredible documentary. The Gentlemen Smugglers are fantastic group of colorful characters and have an amazing story. They were pioneers in the marijuana trade of the 1970's and 1980's. Their story is of historical significance filled with passion, intrigue, adventure, and capitalism.  They had a zest for life and ethos on par with any successful corporation. Their story is stranger than fiction. Larger than life. These men were old fashioned non-violent cowboys living in the 1970's and 1980's South. They did their time and served ridiculously long federal prison sentences. Now we want to share their story to the world. 

Documentaries are extremely difficult to raise financing for and get produced. We have an amazing, dedicated team, but we need your help! Your contribution will be spent on the production, delivery, and promotion of this wildly entertaining story. 

Our team has been self-financing this project for the past two years. We need your help to get it to the finish line without compromise and in-style. We have secured the rights to the book, financed a high quality 12 minute docu-promo, a promotional teaser (link above) and scentless countless hours researching and developing the story that we want to tell.  Funds will go toward incredible re-enactments, great production design, and in- depth research and the use of archival footage. We plan to tell the story of The Gentlemen Smugglers visually through the real life smugglers, wives, ex-wives, sons, daughters, members of the IRS, present and former US Prosecutors, Local Sheriffs, and Political figures.  
We will take the time to craft an incredibly rich story. Our award winning team has a combined 60+ year track record of successfully telling stories and delivering entertainment to the international stage. 
We will have the finest post production completed for the film at Media Toaster in Burbank, CA. www.mediatoaster.com
 Regardless if we reach our crowd funding goal, you can be assured that your contribution will be spent on bringing this wonderful story to the big screen.

 We have been asked to create a three part documentary series for television!  So now the editing begins to take the current version and create three parts that are of broadcast quality.

The expense of editing, rendering and producing three parts as a series is in need of support to pay our stellar editors to lend their expertise to this documentary.

""VINTAGE GLORIOUS GLENDALE"" A SERIOUS DOCUMENTARY ABOUT GLENDALE, CALIFORNIA is an enthusiastic look at the very vintage buildings, businesses, homes
 and people of Glendale California.  A documentary shot in the style of 
""Huell Howser's California Gold"" with interviews and onsite visits 
showing how Glendale started, how it progressed and interviews with 
prominent Glendalians.  So many lovely and interesting places in 
Glendale, from the Alex Theatre to the Metzler Violin Store, Sons of the
 Revolution Library, YWCA, YMCA, Glendale Community College and Foxy's 
Restaurant!  The full length DVD of the documentary is available now along with the 149 page book at Velvet Rhodes Productions website.Vintage Glorious Glendale is screening at the MGN FIVE STAR CINEMA and premiered at the Alex Theatre and has been receiving great reviews which you can read by clicking here:GLENDALE NEWS PRESS READ HERECRESCENTA VALLEY WEEKLY READ HEREGLENDALE NEWS PRESS COMMENTARY READ HERE

 Great Appreciation for All of The Supporters
 It is with great appreciation and gratitude to reach out to all of you who have been so supportive and enthusiastic about Vintage Glorious Glendale..............this documentary could not have been made without your generous contributions!
 
 
The editing for television is quite different than for film, so experts are on board to perfect, sound balance, and color correct each segment removing any technical flaws.  Given the amount of information in this documentary, the process is very time consuming.

 
The monumental success of this documentary will now become a series that can screen around the world on television.

 It is so exciting to have come this far with this film and all because of YOU!

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I still remember that night, January 4th, 2013. It was
just like any other evening, 2 days before I started my Winter quarter as a
Sophomore at University of California, San Diego, little did my mom know that I
was going to come out to her that night. After struggling with my sexuality for
years, I decided that it was time to finally face the truth and start living as
myself. What a better way to accept yourself than having your mom be the first
person in the world to know the truth, right? I thought I was ready, but
apparently I was wrong. Like a lot of our parents, she lost it, freaked out,
and was in complete denial, but it was understandable: I just wasn’t prepared
for it. I had no one to turn to, no one to talk to, and had no idea where or
how to reach for help. If it wasn’t for a guy on social media who talked to me
(whom I didn't even meet in person), I don’t know if I would still be standing
here today. That experience planted a seed in my head:</span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">what would happen if we can build a
localized online community that is safe for people to turn to whenever they
need help, support, or simply someone to talk to?</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">That became the fundamental principle
of Chippr, to serve the LGBT community...</span><br/>
</div><div>
<p>As I started to get used to my “new found identity,” I
began trying out all those dating applications out there; however, I just
wanted to find a like-minded friend. I hesitated when it asked me for a profile
picture because I wasn’t comfortable enough to let people know that I am gay.
After coming through with that process, I realized that having a picture on the
dating applications would result in one of two cases: a hookup or a rejection
that leads to lower self-esteem. It got me curious as to how can we make the
online experience better, more personal, and supportive<i>? What can we do to
make it better? How can we connect people in a more genuine way?</i>The answers to those questions
later became the foundations of Chippr.</p>

</div></div>","FitSteps Life

 The FitSteps team of Ian Waite, Natalie Lowe & Mark Foster founded FitSteps in 2013 to get the world fit through Latin & Ballroom dancing. To date FitSteps has trained over 2,000 instructors who teach FitSteps classes to over 50,000 people each week. The FitSteps program teaches people the fundementals of Latin & Ballroom dancing while incorporating fitness techniques to produce an exercise class that gets you fit, helps you lose weight and teaches you how to dance.
We have just launched our 2 new variations, the first of which is specifically designed for those of you looking to get started at a slower pace or need a lower impact version. The other takes it in the opposite direction, really raising that heart rate and working those muscles!
FitSteps Life is an online community bringing those classes (and much much more), taught by the team, into your home or on to your mobile device.
What is FitSteps Life:

An on-line community for those want to get or keep fit and lose weight

For those who want to dance like the stars they see on their favourite TV shows
A place to learn the steps to all of your favorite Latin & Ballroom dances
Somewhere to can get diet and nutrition tips from an Olympic & 6 time World Champion athelete.
Tips on how the celebrities get that ""Star'' look.
Blogs & Vlogs from the stars
Guest stars and dances
Conditioning programs from the team.

Not everyone can get to a class, and those that do sometimes want more. This community will allow absolutely everyone, no matter where they are located, to have access to classes,  as well as the ability to learn to dance and find out where they can join others taking the class or just interact through the community.


The Team:

  So What Do We Need & Why!
 We are hoping to raise a minimum of £20,000. 
Though we have a huge amount of video content already we want to make sure that on the 1st day the community is launched there will be enough content for everyone of varying levels to enjoy and take part in. It costs a huge amount of money to have this produced to a professional standard and most of the money raised will go to the initial batch of filming.
We also need to upgrade our website, this will allow simple intuitive menu's and the ability to stream all the content on any smart device.
It really is as simple as that! The more we raise the more content we make and the better the platform can be!
Here is the breakdown:


  
Now The Fun Bit!

We have some great rewards for all of our early adopters, everything from a simple thank you from the team to private dance lessons with the stars of the show!
Remember if you want more than 1 perk you can give the subscription to a friend!
We have made some great apparel for you, all of which includes a 30 day subscription to the community. When you get it as part of the reward is actually less than it would cost normally!!

</div></span>The Controversy With Sleep Training<span style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;""><br/></span>
</h1>
</div><div>
<br/><p>The controversial subject of infant sleep training has yet again emerged in main stream media as New York and Los Angeles–based practice Tribeca Pediatrics are now recommending infants as young as <i><b>8 weeks old</b></i> are ready to begin forms of Crying It Out. Even though most pro-sleep training advocates agree that parents shouldn't attempt the ""cry it out"" technique until babies are around four to six months of age, they all claim it teaches babies the ""necessary"" skill of ""self-soothing"" and claim that it's completely harmless, while the opposing side insist that ignoring a baby's cries is a form of neglect which can lead to increased cortisol levels from stress,  physical and mental trauma.  Yet most main stream media coverage tends to gloss over many of the flawed studies and promote the idea that infant (and toddler) night wakings are a <b>problem</b>.  Making babies sleep alone is a fairly new concept in most western societies. For thousands of years humans have parented in a style similar to other mammals and much of the world still continues to carry their babies close both day <i>and</i> night, and given the opportunity to be near their mother's breast so they could nurse whenever they needed.  No strict schedules, timed meals, harmful sleep training techniques, separation for long periods of time from the mother, etc.</p>
</div><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464137398/Industry_y7d7sf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>There was also no need for a multibillion-dollar industry filled with ""experts"" and dozens of products (many which I bought and resold after it didn't ""work"").  There was no need for experts because there simply wasn't a problem to begin with.  Parents knew what infant sleep was and they also knew that night wakings was a temporary time and coped with it with much less maternal depression or anxiety that plagues most new parents today.<div>

The two main forms of crying it out are The Ferber Method and The Extinction Method. Both involve allowing a baby to cry or delaying the offer of comfort.  The Ferber Method recommends timed comforting at increasing intervals (3mins, 5mins, etc).  The Extinction Method on the other hand is where you place your baby in their crib and you do not return until the next morning no matter how long they cry (unless there is something ""really"" wrong i.e. vomiting.  In which case most are instructed to clean up the vomit without making eye contact with your baby so you do not encourage them to vomit for attention/comfort)</p>
<p></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463490193/indiegogo_block_4_mvlpyf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><h3>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;"">I heard about the ""Ferber Method"" during my first year in college but it wasn't until I had my first child that I had taken the time to dig deeper on the subject.  Especially since I knew I could not let my son cry alone if I could help it.  Like most mothers, the sound of my baby crying was unbearable to listen to without doing </span><i style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;"">something</i><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;"">. I quickly found that the subject of sleep was also the main focus of most parent-to-parent conversations, because of course we all need sleep, most of us (like myself) looooooves sleep and a good amount of us don't get enough sleep as it is even </span><i style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;"">pre</i><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;"">-child.  So it's no wonder we are all obsessed with the anything that could get us a little more shut eye.  But I noticed very quickly that there was a clear sense of pressure to ""train"" our son or else we would cause him to be ""too"" dependent on us. I wonder how many parents felt that pressure and who also felt that crying it out  was an unnatural way for helping babies accomplish the holy grail of </span><i style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;"">Sleeping Through The Night </i><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;"">but felt they had no other options.  Something I hear often when speaking to any parent who has willingly or not so willingly sleep trained their children.  So I immersed myself in the world of infant sleep. And what I found was that we do not get </span><i style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;"">all</i><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;""> the information about what infant sleep naturally looks like and more importantly what sleep training </span><i style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;"">really</i><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;""> does to our babies and our bond with them.  </span></span><br/>
</h3>
<p>And yet we <i>all</i> have been told by someone that we <b>must</b> sleep train our children.  The pressure is real.  Very very real. And it's a sensitive time as new mother who is simply exhausted and to hear from medical professionals and peers that she must sleep train and that is the only way baby will learn to self-soothe is just not fair.  As I also found that there were <i>a lot</i> more options to help adjust our lives temporarily during the time when night time parenting is necessary.  But we are told often that co-sleeping is not only dangerous but highly damaging to our children and we are rarely told about the safe ways to co-sleep or bed share (and there are rules just as there are rules for crib sleeping i.e. no loose sheets, bumpers, toys etc.). <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This is why I am making this film.  To give parents the whole picture so they can make decisions based on the whole truth.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>I hope to make this film so we can change the narrative on infant sleep and I truly think with the amazing group of interviewees (both advisors and parents), loads of fascinating research, we will all look at parenting with much more love and acceptance and ideally help reduce a mother's odds at experiencing bouts of depression as a result of the anxiety that this sleep training epidemic has created.<br/></p>

<p>Helen Ball is Professor of Anthropology and Head of the Durham University Anthropology Department (2013-2016). Broadly defined, her research examines the sleep ecology of infants, young children and their parents. This encompasses attitudes and practices regarding infant sleep, behavioral and physiological monitoring of infants and their parents during sleep, infant sleep development, and the discordance between cultural sleep preferences and biological sleep needs. She conducts research in hospitals and the community, and contributes to national and international policy and practice guidelines on infant care (see <a href=""http://www.dur.ac.uk/sleep.lab/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.dur.ac.uk/sleep.lab/</a>).

The Controversy With Sleep Training


The controversial subject of infant sleep training has yet again emerged in main stream media as New York and Los Angeles–based practice Tribeca Pediatrics are now recommending infants as young as 8 weeks old are ready to begin forms of Crying It Out. Even though most pro-sleep training advocates agree that parents shouldn't attempt the ""cry it out"" technique until babies are around four to six months of age, they all claim it teaches babies the ""necessary"" skill of ""self-soothing"" and claim that it's completely harmless, while the opposing side insist that ignoring a baby's cries is a form of neglect which can lead to increased cortisol levels from stress,  physical and mental trauma.  Yet most main stream media coverage tends to gloss over many of the flawed studies and promote the idea that infant (and toddler) night wakings are a problem.  Making babies sleep alone is a fairly new concept in most western societies. For thousands of years humans have parented in a style similar to other mammals and much of the world still continues to carry their babies close both day and night, and given the opportunity to be near their mother's breast so they could nurse whenever they needed.  No strict schedules, timed meals, harmful sleep training techniques, separation for long periods of time from the mother, etc.



There was also no need for a multibillion-dollar industry filled with ""experts"" and dozens of products (many which I bought and resold after it didn't ""work"").  There was no need for experts because there simply wasn't a problem to begin with.  Parents knew what infant sleep was and they also knew that night wakings was a temporary time and coped with it with much less maternal depression or anxiety that plagues most new parents today.










The Obsession with Infant Sleep Training 

Most doctors and pediatricians often recommend some form of sleep training for babies as young as a couple of months old, and are usually told that it is 100% safe. The two main forms of crying it out are The Ferber Method and The Extinction Method. Both involve allowing a baby to cry or delaying the offer of comfort.  The Ferber Method recommends timed comforting at increasing intervals (3mins, 5mins, etc).  The Extinction Method on the other hand is where you place your baby in their crib and you do not return until the next morning no matter how long they cry (unless there is something ""really"" wrong i.e. vomiting.  In which case most are instructed to clean up the vomit without making eye contact with your baby so you do not encourage them to vomit for attention/comfort)


I heard about the ""Ferber Method"" during my first year in college but it wasn't until I had my first child that I had taken the time to dig deeper on the subject.  Especially since I knew I could not let my son cry alone if I could help it.  Like most mothers, the sound of my baby crying was unbearable to listen to without doing something. I quickly found that the subject of sleep was also the main focus of most parent-to-parent conversations, because of course we all need sleep, most of us (like myself) looooooves sleep and a good amount of us don't get enough sleep as it is even pre-child.  So it's no wonder we are all obsessed with the anything that could get us a little more shut eye.  But I noticed very quickly that there was a clear sense of pressure to ""train"" our son or else we would cause him to be ""too"" dependent on us. I wonder how many parents felt that pressure and who also felt that crying it out  was an unnatural way for helping babies accomplish the holy grail of Sleeping Through The Night but felt they had no other options.  Something I hear often when speaking to any parent who has willingly or not so willingly sleep trained their children.  So I immersed myself in the world of infant sleep. And what I found was that we do not get all the information about what infant sleep naturally looks like and more importantly what sleep training really does to our babies and our bond with them.  

And yet we all have been told by someone that we must sleep train our children.  The pressure is real.  Very very real. And it's a sensitive time as new mother who is simply exhausted and to hear from medical professionals and peers that she must sleep train and that is the only way baby will learn to self-soothe is just not fair.  As I also found that there were a lot more options to help adjust our lives temporarily during the time when night time parenting is necessary.  But we are told often that co-sleeping is not only dangerous but highly damaging to our children and we are rarely told about the safe ways to co-sleep or bed share (and there are rules just as there are rules for crib sleeping i.e. no loose sheets, bumpers, toys etc.). 


This is why I am making this film.  To give parents the whole picture so they can make decisions based on the whole truth.  

I hope to make this film so we can change the narrative on infant sleep and I truly think with the amazing group of interviewees (both advisors and parents), loads of fascinating research, we will all look at parenting with much more love and acceptance and ideally help reduce a mother's odds at experiencing bouts of depression as a result of the anxiety that this sleep training epidemic has created.


Our Advisors & Interviewees 


Anthropology Department, Parent-Infant Sleep Lab, Durham University, Durham, UK
Helen Ball is Professor of Anthropology and Head of the Durham University Anthropology Department (2013-2016). Broadly defined, her research examines the sleep ecology of infants, young children and their parents. This encompasses attitudes and practices regarding infant sleep, behavioral and physiological monitoring of infants and their parents during sleep, infant sleep development, and the discordance between cultural sleep preferences and biological sleep needs. She conducts research in hospitals and the community, and contributes to national and international policy and practice guidelines on infant care (see www.dur.ac.uk/sleep.lab/). She oversees the translation of academic research on infant sleep into evidence for use by parents and healthcare staff via ISIS -- the Infant Sleep Information Source website (www.isisonline.org.uk).

Tracy Cassels is the founder and primary writer for Evolutionary Parenting. 
She obtained her B.A. in Cognitive Science from the University of California, Berkeley and an M.A. in Clinical Psychology from the University of British Columbia.  She recently finished her Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology, also at the University of British Columbia, where she both studied how certain evolutionary factors affect children’s empathic behaviour and critically evaluated our assessment of theory of mind in children.  Her academic works have been published in many peer-reviewed journals including Psychological Assessment, PLoS One, Personality and Individual Differences, Midwifery, and more. Tracy serves as an Adviser to the Children’s Health & Human Rights Partnership, a non-profit agency dedicated to ending routine infant circumcision.  She previously worked at the Canadian Council on Learning, a non-profit agency dedicated to researching myriad elements of learning across the lifespan, where her role was to critically analyse educational research to help form policy decisions at local school board and provincial government levels.  Tracy writes on the side with a group of researchers and gentle parenting advocates (including Dr. Darcia Narvaez, Dr. Kathleen Kendall-Tackett, Dr. Wendy Middlemiss, Sarah Ockwell-Smith, and Helen Stevens) who hope to expand awareness of the science and importance of attachment and evolutionary parenting.  Most importantly to her, though, she is a mother to daughter Madeleine (Maddy, age 5), son Theodore (Theo, age baby), stepson Desmond, and wife to husband Brian. 



Dr. Justin Coulson is one of Australia's leading parenting experts and is a highly sought-after international speaker and author. He and his wife Kylie are the parents of six daughters. Yes... six. And yes, they're all from the one family, and no, they aren't disappointed, nor are they going to try for a boy.
After a highly successful radio career Justin returned to school in his late 20’s where he earned his psychology degree from the University of Queensland and his PhD in psychology from the University of Wollongong. He has written multiple peer-reviewed journal articles and scholarly book chapters, as well as several books and ebooks about parenting, including the recently released #1 parenting book, 21 Days to a Happier Family (Harper Collins, 2016).
Justin is an Honorary Fellow at the Centre for Positive Psychology in the Graduate School of Education at the University of Melbourne. He is a consultant to the Federal Government’s Office of the Children’s e-Safety Commissioner, and has acted (and continues to act) in an advisory capacity to well-known organisations including Beyond Blue, the Raising Children Network, Life Education, Intel Security, The Australian Council on Children and the Media, and the Alannah and Madeline Foundation.
In addition, Justin is consistently sought after by the media for his expertise. He writes a weekly parenting advice column for Sydney’s Daily Telegraph, appears regularly on The Project, the TODAY Show, Studio 10, Mornings, and a large number of radio stations around the nation, and he is the parenting expert at kidspot.com.au, Australia’s number one parenting website.
Justin not only knows a lot about parenting and positive psychology, but he lives it. He has successfully taught each of his children to sleep in their own beds, wear clothing even when it’s hot, use the bathroom, and eat at least some of the food on their plate most of the time.
Justin and his wife, Kylie, live on the NSW South Coast.

</p><p><b><u>Summary</u></b></p>
<p>The Race Across America is widely recognized as the toughest
race in the world.  RAAM is a 3,000-mile
coast-to-coast bicycle race that starts in Oceanside, CA and finishes in
Annapolis, MD.  RAAM has become an iconic
American event.  First run in 1982, the
race has continued uninterrupted.  The
2016 race will be its 35<sup>th</sup> year, making it one of the longest
running events in cycling sport.  Racers
and crew come from around the world to compete. 
Why is RAAM so compelling?  Why do
racers and crew keep coming back, year after year?  Why is RAAM – an iconic American event, a
world class event – recognized worldwide but largely unknown in the USA?  Over the years, many films have been made,
but none have answered these questions. 
No film has ever captured what makes RAAM so special.  That story needs to be told.</p>

</div></div>","Summary
The Race Across America is widely recognized as the toughest
race in the world.  RAAM is a 3,000-mile
coast-to-coast bicycle race that starts in Oceanside, CA and finishes in
Annapolis, MD.  RAAM has become an iconic
American event.  First run in 1982, the
race has continued uninterrupted.  The
2016 race will be its 35th year, making it one of the longest
running events in cycling sport.  Racers
and crew come from around the world to compete. 
Why is RAAM so compelling?  Why do
racers and crew keep coming back, year after year?  Why is RAAM – an iconic American event, a
world class event – recognized worldwide but largely unknown in the USA?  Over the years, many films have been made,
but none have answered these questions. 
No film has ever captured what makes RAAM so special.  That story needs to be told.
Our team
The Race: We have deep and wide ranging experience.  We count among us a racer and crew chief with
record setting solo and team finishes. 
Our group includes a successful documentary film-maker, race director
and event owner.  Nobody is better
equipped to tell that story than we are.The Movie: Nothin' But Shorts International, the film maker, is an Australian company with the idea of film is all at once simple, creative and unique. Taking an idea and transforming it into a form that pleases the eye and excites the mind. Here are some samples of their work -RAAM

</ul><br/><blockquote><br/></blockquote></div>","Why Donate?
There are many wonderful relief efforts underway to provide food and shelter in the wake of Cyclone Winston. These are very necessary. Loloma Levu aims to raise enough to restore entire communities to get them back on their feet and to help make them self sustainable again - schools, healthcare centers, churches and homes.


Summary Cyclone Winston, a category 5 cyclone, has left a trail of death and widespread destruction in its wake and our people need help. NOW.
A remote region called the Yasawa Islands was one of many regions in Fiji to be devastated by Winston. More than 90% of staff employed by The Barefoot Collection come from villages in this region. Apart from the emotional trauma and loss of life, they now also face the threat of water-borne diseases, dengue, chikungunya and Zika, if their communities and utilities are not restored.

In order to mobilise our partners, friends and guests to assist our communities, we have established the Loloma Levu Fund.
“Loloma” is Fijian and most commonly translates to love or mercy and “levu” means big, great, large or many. In many cases, the expression “loloma levu” is an idiom,  meaning ""lots of love"" and in the context of this campaign, we hope that many people all over the world can, through a small (or big!) gesture, show their support by helping to rebuild 6 villages.
6 Villages. 60 Days. $6 million.  That’s 1 million people donating just $6!


 What We Need 
 We have set a target of $1 million per village, to rebuild homes, the healthcare centre, restore utilities like water tankers and sanitation, and infrastructure. The villages we are supporting that have been hardest hit are Namara, Naboro, Yamata, Kese, Muaira and Soso.
Funds will be distributed by The Prime Ministers Disaster Relief Fund and whatever is raised will be equally distributed between these villages.   
The Impact 
The Kese Health Centre was established in 1970 and supports five settlements, seven schools and five villages. It is staffed by one nurse and one doctor and helps roughly 500 children and 315 pregnant women each year. Much of the support provided is for maternal, infant care and community health. The center has two beds and also assists with common injuries like cuts and lacerations.


The Namara Village School & Kindergarten was founded in 1980. The school serves 85 children from ages 3 through 13 years old. There are four classrooms and four teachers teaching eight classes, as two grades are taught together in each room. Once the children finish their primary education, the majority then attend boarding school on the main island of Vitu Levu for their high school education.
The Muaira Village Library was established 1 year ago and operates from the primary school in Muaira Village. The primary school serves 77 children from the ages of 3 through 14 years old. The Muaira Village Library provides literature and academic support material for the inhabitants of Kese (251 people) and Muaira (165 people).
These vital community resources have destroyed and will need to be re-built from the ground up.

</div><p><b><u></u></b></p><p></p><p><b>The Right of
Muslim Women to Marry Outside the Faith</b></p>
<p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p><i>“Love has no
boundaries and women have equal rights to men to choose who they want to
marry.”</i></p>
<p>This is the core message of a series
of short films being produced by <a href=""http://ibnrushdmedia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ibn
Rushd Media Productions</a>, an independent media company that
promotes a progressive vision of Islam. The video series centers on the
theologically-grounded argument that Muslim women have the same rights as
Muslim men to marry outside the faith—a view currently not held by the majority
of Muslim scholars. </p>
<p>The first of these short films is a
two-part <a href=""https://youtu.be/l1nd53uwn-A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">interview</a>
with Muslim scholar, Dr. Ahmed Subhy Mansour, who is licensed to perform
marriages in Virginia and has officiated several of these interfaith marriages between
Muslim women and non-Muslim men. The second film is a short <a href=""https://youtu.be/9oKmJ2ugJHk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">promo,</a>
which gathers the opinions of different young professional Muslims and
non-Muslims who live in the United States to discuss their experiences with
love, dating, and marriage as a religious minority in the U.S. The third short film,
which will be released later, is the first in a broader fictional series we are
calling “Leila and Keith” (our play on the famous Arab love
story “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layla_and_Majnun"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Leila
and Qais</a>,” which tells the story of Leila and her struggle to marry a
non-Muslim man, Keith. </p>
<p><b> What We Need &amp; How You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Ibn Rushd self-funded the production
of the first three films.  We are hoping to
raise a total of $25,000.00 through this Indiegogo campaign to produce at least
five more short films in both fictional and interview format to further discuss
the issue from other angles. Any funds raised beyond the initial $25,000.00
will go towards producing a longer documentary about the topic.  </p>
<p>We also greatly welcome IN-KIND
DONATIONS. Let us know if you'd like to offer any creative services, legal
advice, video production and editing<i>, </i>translation services, subtitling
services, access to news footage, music, or anything else that you think can
help. We are also looking for volunteer actors and actresses. Email <a href=""mailto:Info@ibnrushdmedia.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Info@ibnrushdmedia.com</a> with the subject line: ""In Kind"", if you'd like to
discuss these possibilities. </p>
<p>We will host a screening of the
three short films and an open discussion event in Washington D.C. in the summer
of 2016 to share with a wider audience the story behind establishing Ibn Rushd
Media and other behind-the-scenes stories and clips. The exact date of the
screening will be announced in late June, 2016. We also want to hear your
feedback on the films, the issues, and any personal experiences with interfaith
marriage you may want to share. In the meantime, we highly encourage you
participate in our online discussions to hear your stories and feedback, using the
hashtag #HerRight2Marry on our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/IbnRushdMediaLLC"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook
page</a>, our <a href=""https://twitter.com/IbnRushdMedia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter account</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwzDWk9rJDmqp3456bEF2KQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Youtube Channel</a>.</p>
<p><b><i>The Impact</i></b></p>
<p>The central theme of these films is to challenge both the
rising Islamophobia in the United States and conservative ideas within the
Muslim community. We are hoping with these films to raise awareness about
issues of gender equality, the complexities of the Muslim-American experience,
and the potential for greater dialogue and respect within and among the various
faith communities. </p>
<p>While interfaith marriages between Muslim men and non-Muslims women
are common, very few Muslim women exercise the same right. In fact, many people
interviewed did not know or did not believe that Muslim women can marry outside
the faith. <b><i>The goal of the project is not to
encourage Muslim women to marry outside of the faith, rather realize that they have
the right to do so.</i></b> Taking the U.S.
as an example, Muslims represent roughly 1% of the whole population, which
means according to the traditional interpretation, a Muslim woman cannot marry
anyone out of the remaining 99% of Americans. Moreover, such restriction
affects the integration of Muslims in their communities and legitimizes the
anti-Islam rhetoric used by dangerous Islamophobes in the West.</p>
<p><u>Tell</u> us your story or the story of a friend you may know who could/could
not marry because of the false argument that Islam does not allow Muslim women
to marry outside the faith. We are fully aware of the sensitivity of the topic,
and if requested, your identity can remain anonymous.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>We, at Ibn Rushd Media, are fully
aware of the immense risks and challenges that accompany such controversial and
compounded project. Here are a few of these challenges:</p>
<p>1- Finding participants
willing to share their personal story and face societal pressures as many
participants do not want their stories to be told in public, fearing how their
Muslim friends and families may judge them.</p>
<p>2- We are a startup company
that is focusing on projects that are not necessarily profitable despite their
significant impact, so funding will be a challenge. We managed to fund the
first three films by ourselves, but the project is not close to being done and this

Muslim Women to Marry Outside the Faith
Our Story
“Love has no
boundaries and women have equal rights to men to choose who they want to
marry.”
This is the core message of a series
of short films being produced by Ibn
Rushd Media Productions, an independent media company that
promotes a progressive vision of Islam. The video series centers on the
theologically-grounded argument that Muslim women have the same rights as
Muslim men to marry outside the faith—a view currently not held by the majority
of Muslim scholars. 
The first of these short films is a
two-part interview
with Muslim scholar, Dr. Ahmed Subhy Mansour, who is licensed to perform
marriages in Virginia and has officiated several of these interfaith marriages between
Muslim women and non-Muslim men. The second film is a short promo,
which gathers the opinions of different young professional Muslims and
non-Muslims who live in the United States to discuss their experiences with
love, dating, and marriage as a religious minority in the U.S. The third short film,
which will be released later, is the first in a broader fictional series we are
calling “Leila and Keith” (our play on the famous Arab love
story “Leila
and Qais,” which tells the story of Leila and her struggle to marry a
non-Muslim man, Keith. 
 What We Need & How You Can Help
Ibn Rushd self-funded the production
of the first three films.  We are hoping to
raise a total of $25,000.00 through this Indiegogo campaign to produce at least
five more short films in both fictional and interview format to further discuss
the issue from other angles. Any funds raised beyond the initial $25,000.00
will go towards producing a longer documentary about the topic.  
We also greatly welcome IN-KIND
DONATIONS. Let us know if you'd like to offer any creative services, legal
advice, video production and editing, translation services, subtitling
services, access to news footage, music, or anything else that you think can
help. We are also looking for volunteer actors and actresses. Email Info@ibnrushdmedia.com with the subject line: ""In Kind"", if you'd like to
discuss these possibilities. 
We will host a screening of the
three short films and an open discussion event in Washington D.C. in the summer
of 2016 to share with a wider audience the story behind establishing Ibn Rushd
Media and other behind-the-scenes stories and clips. The exact date of the
screening will be announced in late June, 2016. We also want to hear your
feedback on the films, the issues, and any personal experiences with interfaith
marriage you may want to share. In the meantime, we highly encourage you
participate in our online discussions to hear your stories and feedback, using the
hashtag #HerRight2Marry on our Facebook
page, our Twitter account, and Youtube Channel.
The Impact
The central theme of these films is to challenge both the
rising Islamophobia in the United States and conservative ideas within the
Muslim community. We are hoping with these films to raise awareness about
issues of gender equality, the complexities of the Muslim-American experience,
and the potential for greater dialogue and respect within and among the various
faith communities. 
While interfaith marriages between Muslim men and non-Muslims women
are common, very few Muslim women exercise the same right. In fact, many people
interviewed did not know or did not believe that Muslim women can marry outside
the faith. The goal of the project is not to
encourage Muslim women to marry outside of the faith, rather realize that they have
the right to do so. Taking the U.S.
as an example, Muslims represent roughly 1% of the whole population, which
means according to the traditional interpretation, a Muslim woman cannot marry
anyone out of the remaining 99% of Americans. Moreover, such restriction
affects the integration of Muslims in their communities and legitimizes the
anti-Islam rhetoric used by dangerous Islamophobes in the West.
Tell us your story or the story of a friend you may know who could/could
not marry because of the false argument that Islam does not allow Muslim women
to marry outside the faith. We are fully aware of the sensitivity of the topic,
and if requested, your identity can remain anonymous.
Risks & Challenges
We, at Ibn Rushd Media, are fully
aware of the immense risks and challenges that accompany such controversial and
compounded project. Here are a few of these challenges:
1- Finding participants
willing to share their personal story and face societal pressures as many
participants do not want their stories to be told in public, fearing how their
Muslim friends and families may judge them.
2- We are a startup company
that is focusing on projects that are not necessarily profitable despite their
significant impact, so funding will be a challenge. We managed to fund the
first three films by ourselves, but the project is not close to being done and this
is where you come in.
3- We are also facing the
challenge of explaining to the majority of Muslims that, despite the common
belief, Muslim women have the right to marry outside the faith, something that
the majority of current Muslim clerics disagree with.
Mitigating the Risks:
1- We will protect the
identity of any participant, unless they authorize us to use his or her name.
If requested, we will also blur the faces of participants.
2- We are also reaching out
to similar-minded organizations to coordinate efforts and resources to secure
additional funding. 
3- We are using the
expertise of progressive Imams, who ground our work in sound theological and
historical scholarship.

<div>While there have been great strides made in the comedy world with women in film, there is still a lack of representation in the comedy world for women of colour.</div>
<div>Our project is important as it shows that series about women of colour, and people of colour in general, do not have to have race as the over arching theme in order to be popular or worthy of viewing.</div>

<h3>What Have You Got Done So Far?</h3>
<div>Earlier this year we opened a mini gofundme campaign to get money to shoot our first two episodes, plus some excerpts from other episodes that could be used to form a trailer. With £400 pounds we spent two days shooting those scenes and have now cut them together in our trailer. With the extra money not only can we produce the rest of our episodes but also do more thorough post production on our footage which was not completely possible due to limited funds.</div>
<div>In addition to this we have launched accounts on Twitter, Facebook AND Instagram. Have THREE different sets of poster art to choose from. And recorded an original theme song for our series. We have been hard at work for months and we don't expect any of that to stop any time soon. We had our first production meeting back in August and we've been working towards this ever since. So, you can definitely see we're committed and have thought this project out . . . a lot!</div>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>Every crowdfunding campaign has its challenges. For some it's their schedule of sending out perks. For others it's the wave of panic when their campaign goes so viral they don't know what to do with themselves or the extra cash that has come rolling in.</div>
<div>We are prepared for both instances. </div>
<div>In the wonderful instance that you guys get us over that 100% mark, don't fret about where that extra money's going. No one here is going to be off buying big mansions. All extra money will go towards a SECOND season of our show. We love these characters and we know they have so many more exciting and funny storyline's for you all to enjoy.

There are other ways to help us reach our goal which won't make any kind of impact on your bank account. Here are some of those ways:</p> <ul> <li>Tell people about how much you love our campaign. Tell your co-workers, your mom, that cute guy at the coffee shop who kinda looks like Chris Evans. Who knows?

Being a confident women doesn't mean you have to be perfect . . . or even involve wearing matching clothes. And being reasonably successful in your 20s doesn't mean you won't get dead cat ashes mailed to your work place from little old ladies. These are some of the wonderful and weird insights we hope to bring forward with our new comedy, You Can Do Better.
Kayla Hairy, is a twenty four year old aspiring journalist, current cat obituary writer, hypochondriac and maybe the funniest, sweetest person you'll ever meet. We follow Kayla, in all the trouble her weirdness and un- containable confidence causes her to fall in to, head first and with her granny knickers showing.
This story is absurd but it also has a lot of heart like all good comedy does. But to make this come true we need money. With it, we'll be able to create the best quality web series for all of you, which is important to us, since you're who we want to enjoy it!

What We Need & What You Get
The money will be used for the usual suspects, paying cast and crew, equipment, craft services, locations, and money for all things post.
But the best part about this whole thing is that you get something back in return. We have numerous perks including personally written postcards, signed posters, your very own cat obituary with the cat name of your choice not to mention being able to visit us on set during a party episode!
Just know, no matter how much money we get it's all going towards producing episodes of great content!

<div>I have been a filmmaker and Human Rights Campaigner for several years. Upon hearing the story of Eduardo and visiting the favelas of Rio, I struggled to understand why a place such as Complexo-do-Alemão could be host to such horrific stories.

<div>I have been filming in the favelas of Rio for several years, I had a collection of horror stories from a large number of people who lost their loved ones to the war on drugs. For me, 7 years is enough, I had to share these stories, I had to help people in the favelas to find their own voice.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>BIO: An experience producer, interpreter and fixer, Angelica Mel has worked on a diverse range of projects for clients including YAHOO! Dubai, Discovery Channel, Michelin and the Danish Broadcasting Corporation. Bilingual in Portuguese and English, she founded Maruti Blue Productions in 2008 working on projects in Brazil. Angelica now works as a film producer, managing large-scale crews, and researching stories, scouting locations and arranging every aspect of filming logistics.

<div><br/></div>
<h3>What we hope to achieve</h3>
<div>Our project is designed to help generate awareness and inspire change to the growing War on Drugs in the Favela's of Rio de Janeiro that are currently undergoing Pacification. The Favela Pacification Programme is fierce, breaking multiple Human Rights laws in a country where someone dies every 10-minutes as a result of the War on Drugs, and the police kill every 3 hours.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The project completely and independently produced by S2S Media and Maruti Blue Productions, having already invested upwards of $30 000 of our own money, allowing the freedom to explore and challenge existing representations of the favela communities in Rio. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>With reviews and articles stretching from Singapore, Czech Republic and the UK, to Brazil, USA and Canada, we are slowly drawing eyes beyond the postcard image of Rio to the often miss-represented 'dark side'. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Here lies our opportunity, in Olympic year, to show the true impact of the Olympic Games, Pacification and lack of Government responsibility on these impoverished communities who continue to fight for justice, for their right to peace and to make the world aware of the living conditions enforced on them by the War on Drugs. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Fundamentally, this documentary is not here to provide all the answers, but instead hopes to allow voices to be heard, to begin conversations by simply asking the right questions that - in time - will hopefully lead to resolutions. So, if you want justice, then please please please donate to help bring our film to the world!</div>
</div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;"">
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</span></div> </div> <div>
<p>We are looking to raise $16 000 to help cover the following:</p>
<p>1. Our Global Premiere at the Odeon Theatre in Rio de Janeiro taking place on June 23rd. This will include organisation of international media, exhibitions of the work done by Human Rights campaigners in the Favela's of Rio and marketing to help generate as much awareness about the film and the issues represented within it ($3250).</p>
<p>2. Music Licences for our film have been offered to us at significantly discounted rates totalling $4000. A High-Profile soundtrack that embodies music spanning over 6 decades helps emphasise the length of time the struggles and issues represented in the film have been occurring. </p>
<p>3. Certification and Classification is required in both Brazil and the UK to help distribute our film via Video-On-Demand (Global) services and DVD (Europe Only). The BBFC in the UK for example charge by the minute, as well as a one-off fee, meaning that to obtain legal permission to distribute in the UK and Europe can cost upwards of £3000 ($5000). </p>
<p>4. Independent screenings with QnA's to help educate students and residents in the Favela's of Rio about the wider context of the issues they are currently encased in. This will help create a greater understanding, helping Human Rights campaigners of protests to channel their cause to more specific aspects of the issues ($2750). </p>
<p>5. The final $1000 will help with any surprises along the way, ensuring we have a back-up fund for any disaster!</p>
<p>If we fail to raise the full amount, it will not prevent us from achieving our overall aims however, it may mean we simply might not be able to spread our message as far as we hope. Rest-assured Angel and David have been, and will continue to, work 24/7 to help raise awareness and every penny will be stretched as far as possible to aid this.</p>
<p>Our perks offer a unique opportunity to get involved and to take a piece of our film and bring it into your very own home. As well as this, every contribution generate change, and it is important that everyone is acknowledged for your hard work and hard-earned money that you are so willing to donate to this cause. As you can see from the perks, we are determined to make every member of this production valued and celebrated - so have a good look at each perk and see which one suits you - as we said before, every single penny goes a long way.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p>Having already shot the
majority of our footage, we have been fortunate enough to have multiple
interviews with Terezinha de Jesus, the mother of 10-year old Eduardo (who was
shot and killed on April 2nd 2015). Terezinha has become an icon for the people
against the FPP (Favela Pacification Programme) having been featured consistently
throughout Amnesty International's content. Terezinha is a friend to the
filmmakers and has provided us with a raw insight on the subject area of her
son’s death, the troubles in the favelas and her own struggle.</p>
<p>Beyond this, we have
also interviewed a whistleblower from the Police in Rio, a
Colonel called Íbis. He has taken great personal risk to speak with us,
sharing his insight on the issues within the favela of Alemão and the
pacification program as a whole. He has agreed to allow us use of his image and
full name in the hope of inspiring others within the police to speak up about
the ongoing war on drugs.</p>
<p>Two former drug traffickers in Rio de Janeiro also agreed to an interview, one of whom was
a published writer at the age of 16, the other a father. Their personalities
are strong, their viewpoints are educated and extremely valuable to understanding all aspects of the War on Drugs and the impact of the Pacification Programme.</p>
<p>Raull is a human rights
activist based in Alemão. He has organised various protests both on the night
of Eduardo’s death, as well as consistently throughout the year. His politics
are current and deeply routed; his passion is very much supported by the local community, as well as Amnesty International. In recent weeks his friends and family have been receiving threats from the Police to prevent him gathering further support.</p>
<p>Tiago is a photojournalist
operating out of Rio. He accompanies the Police on raids, as well as providing
media coverage to various media outlets in Brazil to help raise awareness on the
social issues in the favelas of Rio.</p>
<p>There are a series of
other interviews that we have already collected that will form a small part of
the documentary but certainly Terezinha, Ibis, The Guys (Drug Traffickers)
Tiago and Raull are the 5 main cornerstones of the documentary cut together with
given footage and various images captured as part of our filming days in Rio.</p>
<p>The content is there, the rough cut is assembled and we are almost at the stage to present our work to the world. We have already shown our film privately in test-screenings to press and Universities around the World. Initial responses are positive, having received some excellent reviews.

<p><i><u>O Outro Lado Do Cart</u></i><i><u>ã</u></i><i><u>o-Postal/The
Other Side of the Postcard </u></i><u>(Morris
&amp; Melo, 2016) – Review by Chloe McMahon (UK)</u></p>
<p><u></u></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>In the pursuit of justice, Morris and Melo delve into the
fractured underbelly of Rio, exposing what the picturesque postcard struggles
to hide.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“There is no escape,” claims an activist. These
words drape over the favelas of Rio like a never-ending omen, trapping its
inhabitants in a world where the value of a human life is so easily disregarded.
Indeed, it drapes over the documentary itself, channelling through each facet
of the community from the drug traffickers to the grieving mothers of deceased
children.</p>
<p>This harrowing account of the slums begins
unexpectedly with what seems like a playful cartoon aimed at children. Bright
colours, an informative voiceover and stimulating animation make up the
ingredients of what is expected of a primary school educational video. However,
there is a deeply saddening reason as why the narrative is constructed in this
way. Concluding with animated splatters of blood and racing bullets, this
prelude communicates clearly how involved children are in the crossfire of
favela conflict. Innocence seems obsolete in a corrupted environment.</p>
<p>One such victim is 10-year-old Eduardo who
was shot dead by law enforcers in the spring of 2015. Morris and Melo follow his
mother as she fights for justice against the Brazilian court. What is haunting
about her story is not the events that unfolded but the composure she maintains
when explaining it. The camera lingers on her like an uncomfortable spectator,
capturing her emptiness of emotion and sense of loss. There is an exhaustion in
her words that resonates among the favelas. With 60,000 Brazilians dying a
year, Eduardo’s death comes sadly as normality within the slums.</p>
<p></p>
</div> <p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>One of our most fundamental challenges is Safety for our Subjects and Film Crew based in Rio de Janeiro. With support from Human Rights groups, as well as developing high-profile awareness around the film protects the entire team from overly-aggressive attacks from authorities in Rio. With this taken into consideration however, it is simply impossible to completely protect ourselves from any potential attack from either side of the Drugs War. <span><br/></span>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Finances are also a challenge as we are completely independent and free from any larger media influence, we make every penny go as far as we can. This also means that we rely on the help and support of our family, friends and kind-hearted strangers to help support our film and generate the awareness these issues so desperately need. Through this crowd-funding campaign, these challenges present a much reduced risk, so thank you!</div>
<div><br/></div> <p>Finally, obtaining classification in various countries will prove difficult, given the graphic and honest content in the film. We have developed a strategic distribution and marketing plan that will allow us to bring the film to our primary target market through the use of Social Media, Independent Media and Online Distribution channels. This has also been helped by the excellent support from the Odeon in Rio de Janeiro, who have offered us a large-scale Premiere at their 99-year old theatre, followed by a week-long theatrical release in the same theatre. This kind act alone means that up 4000 people in the city of Rio will have the opportunity to watch this film - so the funds raised from this campaign will play a significant role in our marketing plan and getting those seats filled!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>Obviously we understand that most people aren't made of money - we aren't! That's why we are asking for help. But that doesn't mean you still can't help us. If you would like to get involved in the production, then get in touch via info@s2s-media.com. Your support might be something as simple as sharing our crowd funding campaign amongst your family and friends or on social media, maybe you could write a review for us, organise a screening at your University or in your local community, share our website and social media pages (all those 'likes' on Facebook fill everyone who has worked on this documentary so far with hope and greater determination - we cannot tell you how great it feels to know our message is being heard!). </div>
<div><br/></div> <p>So use the sharing tools on this page, the website <a href=""http://www.s2s-media.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.s2s-media.com</a> or on Facebook.com/OutroLadoCartaoPostal. <span><br/></span><span><span><br/><br/></span>Finally, if you've made it to this part of the page we just want to throw you a big THANK YOU for taking your time to read what we have to say. We hope it inspires you to donate, or maybe even get out there and fight for your own personal causes! </span></p>

With reviews and articles stretching from Singapore, Czech Republic and the UK, to Brazil, USA and Canada, we are slowly drawing eyes beyond the postcard image of Rio to the often miss-represented 'dark side'. 

Here lies our opportunity, in Olympic year, to show the true impact of the Olympic Games, Pacification and lack of Government responsibility on these impoverished communities who continue to fight for justice, for their right to peace and to make the world aware of the living conditions enforced on them by the War on Drugs. 

Fundamentally, this documentary is not here to provide all the answers, but instead hopes to allow voices to be heard, to begin conversations by simply asking the right questions that - in time - will hopefully lead to resolutions. So, if you want justice, then please please please donate to help bring our film to the world!



What We Need & What You Get
  
We are looking to raise $16 000 to help cover the following:
1. Our Global Premiere at the Odeon Theatre in Rio de Janeiro taking place on June 23rd. This will include organisation of international media, exhibitions of the work done by Human Rights campaigners in the Favela's of Rio and marketing to help generate as much awareness about the film and the issues represented within it ($3250).
2. Music Licences for our film have been offered to us at significantly discounted rates totalling $4000. A High-Profile soundtrack that embodies music spanning over 6 decades helps emphasise the length of time the struggles and issues represented in the film have been occurring. 
3. Certification and Classification is required in both Brazil and the UK to help distribute our film via Video-On-Demand (Global) services and DVD (Europe Only). The BBFC in the UK for example charge by the minute, as well as a one-off fee, meaning that to obtain legal permission to distribute in the UK and Europe can cost upwards of £3000 ($5000). 
4. Independent screenings with QnA's to help educate students and residents in the Favela's of Rio about the wider context of the issues they are currently encased in. This will help create a greater understanding, helping Human Rights campaigners of protests to channel their cause to more specific aspects of the issues ($2750). 
5. The final $1000 will help with any surprises along the way, ensuring we have a back-up fund for any disaster!
If we fail to raise the full amount, it will not prevent us from achieving our overall aims however, it may mean we simply might not be able to spread our message as far as we hope. Rest-assured Angel and David have been, and will continue to, work 24/7 to help raise awareness and every penny will be stretched as far as possible to aid this.
Our perks offer a unique opportunity to get involved and to take a piece of our film and bring it into your very own home. As well as this, every contribution generate change, and it is important that everyone is acknowledged for your hard work and hard-earned money that you are so willing to donate to this cause. As you can see from the perks, we are determined to make every member of this production valued and celebrated - so have a good look at each perk and see which one suits you - as we said before, every single penny goes a long way.

    The Impact

Having already shot the
majority of our footage, we have been fortunate enough to have multiple
interviews with Terezinha de Jesus, the mother of 10-year old Eduardo (who was
shot and killed on April 2nd 2015). Terezinha has become an icon for the people
against the FPP (Favela Pacification Programme) having been featured consistently
throughout Amnesty International's content. Terezinha is a friend to the
filmmakers and has provided us with a raw insight on the subject area of her
son’s death, the troubles in the favelas and her own struggle.
Beyond this, we have
also interviewed a whistleblower from the Police in Rio, a
Colonel called Íbis. He has taken great personal risk to speak with us,
sharing his insight on the issues within the favela of Alemão and the
pacification program as a whole. He has agreed to allow us use of his image and
full name in the hope of inspiring others within the police to speak up about
the ongoing war on drugs.
Two former drug traffickers in Rio de Janeiro also agreed to an interview, one of whom was
a published writer at the age of 16, the other a father. Their personalities
are strong, their viewpoints are educated and extremely valuable to understanding all aspects of the War on Drugs and the impact of the Pacification Programme.
Raull is a human rights
activist based in Alemão. He has organised various protests both on the night
of Eduardo’s death, as well as consistently throughout the year. His politics
are current and deeply routed; his passion is very much supported by the local community, as well as Amnesty International. In recent weeks his friends and family have been receiving threats from the Police to prevent him gathering further support.
Tiago is a photojournalist
operating out of Rio. He accompanies the Police on raids, as well as providing
media coverage to various media outlets in Brazil to help raise awareness on the
social issues in the favelas of Rio.
There are a series of
other interviews that we have already collected that will form a small part of
the documentary but certainly Terezinha, Ibis, The Guys (Drug Traffickers)
Tiago and Raull are the 5 main cornerstones of the documentary cut together with
given footage and various images captured as part of our filming days in Rio.
The content is there, the rough cut is assembled and we are almost at the stage to present our work to the world. We have already shown our film privately in test-screenings to press and Universities around the World. Initial responses are positive, having received some excellent reviews.

O Outro Lado Do Cartão-Postal/The
Other Side of the Postcard (Morris
& Melo, 2016) – Review by Chloe McMahon (UK)


In the pursuit of justice, Morris and Melo delve into the
fractured underbelly of Rio, exposing what the picturesque postcard struggles
to hide.



“There is no escape,” claims an activist. These
words drape over the favelas of Rio like a never-ending omen, trapping its
inhabitants in a world where the value of a human life is so easily disregarded.
Indeed, it drapes over the documentary itself, channelling through each facet
of the community from the drug traffickers to the grieving mothers of deceased
children.
This harrowing account of the slums begins
unexpectedly with what seems like a playful cartoon aimed at children. Bright
colours, an informative voiceover and stimulating animation make up the
ingredients of what is expected of a primary school educational video. However,
there is a deeply saddening reason as why the narrative is constructed in this
way. Concluding with animated splatters of blood and racing bullets, this
prelude communicates clearly how involved children are in the crossfire of
favela conflict. Innocence seems obsolete in a corrupted environment.
One such victim is 10-year-old Eduardo who
was shot dead by law enforcers in the spring of 2015. Morris and Melo follow his
mother as she fights for justice against the Brazilian court. What is haunting
about her story is not the events that unfolded but the composure she maintains
when explaining it. The camera lingers on her like an uncomfortable spectator,
capturing her emptiness of emotion and sense of loss. There is an exhaustion in
her words that resonates among the favelas. With 60,000 Brazilians dying a
year, Eduardo’s death comes sadly as normality within the slums.

 
    Risks & Challenges
One of our most fundamental challenges is Safety for our Subjects and Film Crew based in Rio de Janeiro. With support from Human Rights groups, as well as developing high-profile awareness around the film protects the entire team from overly-aggressive attacks from authorities in Rio. With this taken into consideration however, it is simply impossible to completely protect ourselves from any potential attack from either side of the Drugs War. 


Finances are also a challenge as we are completely independent and free from any larger media influence, we make every penny go as far as we can. This also means that we rely on the help and support of our family, friends and kind-hearted strangers to help support our film and generate the awareness these issues so desperately need. Through this crowd-funding campaign, these challenges present a much reduced risk, so thank you!
 Finally, obtaining classification in various countries will prove difficult, given the graphic and honest content in the film. We have developed a strategic distribution and marketing plan that will allow us to bring the film to our primary target market through the use of Social Media, Independent Media and Online Distribution channels. This has also been helped by the excellent support from the Odeon in Rio de Janeiro, who have offered us a large-scale Premiere at their 99-year old theatre, followed by a week-long theatrical release in the same theatre. This kind act alone means that up 4000 people in the city of Rio will have the opportunity to watch this film - so the funds raised from this campaign will play a significant role in our marketing plan and getting those seats filled!

    Other Ways You Can Help
Obviously we understand that most people aren't made of money - we aren't! That's why we are asking for help. But that doesn't mean you still can't help us. If you would like to get involved in the production, then get in touch via info@s2s-media.com. Your support might be something as simple as sharing our crowd funding campaign amongst your family and friends or on social media, maybe you could write a review for us, organise a screening at your University or in your local community, share our website and social media pages (all those 'likes' on Facebook fill everyone who has worked on this documentary so far with hope and greater determination - we cannot tell you how great it feels to know our message is being heard!). 
 So use the sharing tools on this page, the website www.s2s-media.com or on Facebook.com/OutroLadoCartaoPostal. Finally, if you've made it to this part of the page we just want to throw you a big THANK YOU for taking your time to read what we have to say. We hope it inspires you to donate, or maybe even get out there and fight for your own personal causes!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

worldwide release in 2017/2018. It will run 
approximately 90 minutes.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458132797/cz9ht8kfoatvcyt38yka.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 401.227px;height: 582px;""/></p>
<br/><h3></h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p></p>
<p>A young couple in tropical Australia, Dylan and Maisie, is trapped in their beach house by three 
desperate fugitives carrying a mysterious box containing unknown contents, and 
they must rely on their wits and cunning to survive as a severe tropical
 cyclone looms.</p>
<p>Inspired by classic film noirs, <i><b>Landfall</b></i>  is chock-full of twists, suspense, and some very nasty weather.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What we're asking for<br/>
</h3>We believe quality feature films don't have to cost millions of dollars. We need just <b>$30,000</b> (or more) to make <i><b>Landfall</b></i>  a solid piece of entertainment. We already own all our own camera, sound and editing gear, so this budget will allow us to cover other costs such as:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Cast &amp; crew.</li>
<li>Props.</li>
<li>Costumes.</li>
<li>Transport to and from location.</li>
<li>Catering.</li>
<li>Visual and practical effects to bring the cyclone to life.</li>
<li>Commissioning a cool poster from genius Brazilian artist Juarez Ricci (see his amazing <b><i>Throwback</i></b>  poster below).</li>
<li>An original music score by the talented Cairns composer Samantha van der Sluis.</li>
<li>Submissions to film festivals.</li>
<li>Travel and registration for the American Film Market in November 2016, where we hope to sell <b><i>Landfall</i></b>  to international cinema and DVD distributors!<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What you get in return<br/>
</h3>To thank you for supporting our film, we'll give you cool rewards based on how much you contribute, rewards such as:<br/><br/>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>And lots more!<br/></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Our timeline</h3>
<p>We've already mapped out our game plan for <i><b>Landfall</b></i>, and it goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>July 2016: we'll start filming <i><b>Landfall</b></i>  at a stunning Queensland beach house.<br/>
</li>
<li>November 2016: after months of editing, we'll submit the finished cut of <i><b>Landfall</b></i>  to one of the world's major international film festivals: the South By Southwest Film Festival. Submissions to many more festivals, such as the Toronto International Film Festival and the TriBeCa Film Festival, will follow in 2017. If <i><b>Landfall</b></i>  gets accepted into one of these prestigious 
festivals, our chances of getting a worldwide DVD/Blu-ray distribution 
deal will increase dramatically. Also around this time, we'll present the finished film to prospective distributors and sales agents at the annual American Film Market in Santa Monica, California.</li>
<li>2017 and beyond: <i><b>Landfall</b></i>  will either screen at a cinema near you, or it'll become available for you to watch on DVD/Blu-ray, or both! That is our goal.<br/>
</li>
</ul>

Landfall  is the new feature film from Australian writer/director Travis Bain of
Sapphire Pictures. Landfall  is an intense crime thriller/disaster movie aimed at a 
worldwide release in 2017/2018. It will run 
approximately 90 minutes.


Synopsis

A young couple in tropical Australia, Dylan and Maisie, is trapped in their beach house by three 
desperate fugitives carrying a mysterious box containing unknown contents, and 
they must rely on their wits and cunning to survive as a severe tropical
 cyclone looms.
Inspired by classic film noirs, Landfall  is chock-full of twists, suspense, and some very nasty weather.


What we're asking for
We believe quality feature films don't have to cost millions of dollars. We need just $30,000 (or more) to make Landfall  a solid piece of entertainment. We already own all our own camera, sound and editing gear, so this budget will allow us to cover other costs such as:
Cast & crew.
Props.
Costumes.
Transport to and from location.
Catering.
Visual and practical effects to bring the cyclone to life.
Commissioning a cool poster from genius Brazilian artist Juarez Ricci (see his amazing Throwback  poster below).
An original music score by the talented Cairns composer Samantha van der Sluis.
Submissions to film festivals.
Travel and registration for the American Film Market in November 2016, where we hope to sell Landfall  to international cinema and DVD distributors!




What you get in return
To thank you for supporting our film, we'll give you cool rewards based on how much you contribute, rewards such as:

Access to private updates, including video diaries, photos and more.

A personal thankyou in
 the credits.
A download of the finished movie.
Seats at the private cast and crew screening, well in advance of the film's public release.
A download of the shooting script.

Exceptional local and international exposure for your business or brand if you choose the business sponsorship reward
Downloads of the original soundtrack by Samantha van der Sluis.
Naming rights to one of the characters.

Tickets to the gala Cairns premiere.
An Executive Producer 
credit.

And lots more!



Our timeline
We've already mapped out our game plan for Landfall, and it goes like this:

July 2016: we'll start filming Landfall  at a stunning Queensland beach house.

November 2016: after months of editing, we'll submit the finished cut of Landfall  to one of the world's major international film festivals: the South By Southwest Film Festival. Submissions to many more festivals, such as the Toronto International Film Festival and the TriBeCa Film Festival, will follow in 2017. If Landfall  gets accepted into one of these prestigious 
festivals, our chances of getting a worldwide DVD/Blu-ray distribution 
deal will increase dramatically. Also around this time, we'll present the finished film to prospective distributors and sales agents at the annual American Film Market in Santa Monica, California.
2017 and beyond: Landfall  will either screen at a cinema near you, or it'll become available for you to watch on DVD/Blu-ray, or both! That is our goal.



Who's in the movie?We're lining up some great actors for Landfall.Legendary Aussie badass Vernon Wells from Mad Max 2,
Commando  and our previous feature Throwback  has signed on to play a major character: Sergeant Wexler, a veteran cop with a troubled past.And if we hit our target, we'll be able to cast not one but TWO other famous actors in Landfall,  whose identities will be revealed if we pass the $30,000 mark. These actors are well-known for their film and TV work spanning many decades, and they've already agreed to jump on board Landfall  if we hit our target ... so let's hit our target!!!Who we areWe’re Sapphire Pictures, an independent production company based in Cairns,
Australia, headed by award-winning filmmaker Travis Bain, who recently made the low-budget monster movie Throwback.  Here's the trailer:And the poster by artist Juarez Ricci:Throwback  screened at a dozen international film festivals and it's now available on DVD and Blu-ray worldwide.

Starspawn: Overture  starts filming in April 2016 and will be made available on YouTube after its film festival run. Landfall  is the project that will keep us busy and sharp while we're seeking the finance for Starspawn.People who have seen our films have said the same thing

</p>
<p>For most of
my life, I was not comfortable sharing with my friends and colleagues that I
was diagnosed with <b>Asperger’s Syndrome</b>
when I was five years old. It wasn’t until I was nine years old that my parents
sat me down and explained how I was different from the other kids, and I have
been overcoming the challenges of Asperger’s ever since. </p>
<p>For those of
you who do not know, Asperger’s Syndrome is a social condition that is
classified as an <b>Autism Spectrum
Disorder</b><span>  as it shares some of the
key symptoms of Autism (difficulty making eye contact, difficulty participating
in a conversation, obsessive behaviour and dependence on routine). Despite
these challenges, which can make a person with Asperger's seem clumsy or otherwise
unintelligent, they can process and interpret information extremely fast and
are highly intelligent. When it comes to dating and being in romantic
relationships, it’s a whole different world for them.</span></p>
<p>Even though I
can quote films verbatim and was very good at video games as a kid, I struggled
throughout my childhood and teen years with making friends and speaking up about
what was important to me. Dating was, at one point, something I considered
impossible. I was always terrified of saying the wrong thing, or hearing girls
tell me ""you're weird"". Constant rejection in places like High School,
College, or University can also leave a lot of us feeling hopeless. </p>
<p>On a more
positive note, I learned through my childhood and teen years to overcome most
of these challenges, and I became a film-maker as a means to express myself
through visual story-telling. I also go on dates as often as I can, which I
really enjoy. </p>
<p>I
participated in a Self-Expression and Leadership Program in 2015, and from that
course, was inspired to create a project
that would make a difference for people with Asperger's, whilst staying true to
my film-making roots. The concept for the documentary <i>Awkward Love: Dating for People with Asperger's Syndrome</i> was born.</p>
<p>Ever since I
started talking about making this film, I have been exploring and researching
the issue of what it is like for people with Asperger's to date and be involved
in romantic relationships. I conducted a series of on-camera and off-camera
interviews, and the footage was cut to make a trailer.
</p>
<p>That's when
the film started to gain attention from the Asperger's community, other
film-makers, the media, and families affected by the spectrum.</p>
<p>I also
collaborated with dating coaches Lesley Edwards, Dr. Stephen De Wit, and Laura
Bilotta of <i>Single in the City</i>, to create a special seminar called <i>Date Camp for Asperger's</i>, where people on
the spectrum came together for an afternoon of learning new social skills, and
sharing personal stories. Toronto-based dating coach Layan Bubbly has also expressed
interest in being a part of this film, and is excited to make a difference on
camera.</p>
<p>Today, I realize now more than ever how important this topic is to many people, and I
now have a clear idea of what I want the film to be about - we will tell a
story about someone with Asperger's Syndrome who brings together relationship
and dating experts to work directly with people on the spectrum to understand
how they function in different social arena's and on dates, to inspire them to
have the love lives they want and deserve.</p>
<p>Our team needs

After coming home from her first year away at college,
 Olivia finds her family slaughtered in their beds by the mysterious masked ""Mr. No 
Name"", plunging her into a deep 
depression. 
In an attempt to distract Olivia during the one year 
anniversary of the tragedy, her cousin, Izzie, convinces her to travel 
to their family's river house for the weekend, failing to mention the 
group of college kids waiting to party back at the cabin. Olivia is 
furious, but decides to make the best of the weekend, agreeing that 
distraction may be what she needs the most. 
The 
weekend of distraction takes a dark turn, however, when people start to 
disappear! Is it Mr. No Name? Or is it a new threat all together? In the
 end, the true question remains...can Olivia survive the weekend and 
defeat the true killer before she's consumed by the demons in her own 
mind?

</h2><p>The FIXER is an ambitious and complex project for an indie/student filmmaker. It had drone shots, car scenes, tracking shots, fight scenes, long takes, gun fights, and even a dog. On top of that it was shot on prime locations in Miami, FL and using RAW in 4K, something that demands not only computer power and state of the art technology, but a lot of storage.</p><p>To achieve it, our prep was rather comprehensive: Castings, Call Backs, Rehearsals, Location Scouts, Location Tech Scouts, Story Boards, Gear Tests, more rehearsals, etc. The Pre-Production phase ran through the spring and summer 2016, and Production was from the the fall of 2016 thru spring of 2017.</p><p>All spread out during that period, we produced the whole Episode 01  (Pilot) in 14 Days of Principal Photography. Unfortunately we had to compromise three scenes that we couldn't afford,  but that could live without, and were thus put on hold.  With everybody's collaboration, we pulled it off. However, in this expensive business, making the most out of every cent is a must. </p><p>We were very very efficient in Producing this film, whose main purpose is not only to be sold, but to put everyone in the map: showcasing their skills.  Everyone sacrificed and compromised quite a lot, both cast and crew, because they beileve in the project!</p><p>Please Check out also the Behind the Scenes Photos Already Uploaded.</p><p>And that is why we need you. We need your support to have the movie and concept be sold. The movie is being pitched and in Festivals, studios and networks privately, however, before its officially Premiered, it needs 3 things that literally cant wait: a couple very specific finishing high-tech/advanced work done in Post-Production,  the music and the music rights need to be paid for, and some cash needs to be spent in marketing and promotion at festivals and what not. </p><h2>THE TRAILER</h2><h3><a href=""http://bit.ly/THEFIXERfacebook"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://bit.ly/THEFIXERfacebook</a></h3><p> </p><p><strong>Title:</strong> THE FIXER</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> DRAMA / ACTION</p><p><strong>Type:</strong>  Pilot</p><p><strong>Medium</strong>:  Digital HD – 4K</p><p><strong>Theme: </strong>Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it.<br/><strong>Logline (Season 01):</strong> In an office of Karma Fixers a hit man and his colleagues, find themselves entangled, while attempting to rescue his kidnapped daughter from their own boss.</p><p>---------</p><p><strong>Theme (Pilot):  </strong>Your worst enemy can be your best friend, and your best friend your worst enemy.</p><p><strong>Logline (Pilot): </strong>After fixing another 'regular', Natasha wants to quit yet again.

The FIXER is an ambitious and complex project for an indie/student filmmaker. It had drone shots, car scenes, tracking shots, fight scenes, long takes, gun fights, and even a dog. On top of that it was shot on prime locations in Miami, FL and using RAW in 4K, something that demands not only computer power and state of the art technology, but a lot of storage.To achieve it, our prep was rather comprehensive: Castings, Call Backs, Rehearsals, Location Scouts, Location Tech Scouts, Story Boards, Gear Tests, more rehearsals, etc. The Pre-Production phase ran through the spring and summer 2016, and Production was from the the fall of 2016 thru spring of 2017.All spread out during that period, we produced the whole Episode 01  (Pilot) in 14 Days of Principal Photography. Unfortunately we had to compromise three scenes that we couldn't afford,  but that could live without, and were thus put on hold.  With everybody's collaboration, we pulled it off. However, in this expensive business, making the most out of every cent is a must. We were very very efficient in Producing this film, whose main purpose is not only to be sold, but to put everyone in the map: showcasing their skills.  Everyone sacrificed and compromised quite a lot, both cast and crew, because they beileve in the project!Please Check out also the Behind the Scenes Photos Already Uploaded.And that is why we need you. We need your support to have the movie and concept be sold. The movie is being pitched and in Festivals, studios and networks privately, however, before its officially Premiered, it needs 3 things that literally cant wait: a couple very specific finishing high-tech/advanced work done in Post-Production,  the music and the music rights need to be paid for, and some cash needs to be spent in marketing and promotion at festivals and what not. THE TRAILERhttp://bit.ly/THEFIXERfacebook Title: THE FIXERGenre: DRAMA / ACTIONType:  PilotMedium:  Digital HD – 4KTheme: Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it.Logline (Season 01): In an office of Karma Fixers a hit man and his colleagues, find themselves entangled, while attempting to rescue his kidnapped daughter from their own boss.---------Theme (Pilot):  Your worst enemy can be your best friend, and your best friend your worst enemy.Logline (Pilot): After fixing another 'regular', Natasha wants to quit yet again.

Overall Concept:
     As a retired Navy SEAL and former Law Enforcement Officer; I wanted to produce a instructional movie that shared with the audience information about firearms safety and suggestions on how to improve their shooting skills.
My desire was to include what I have learned over the past 30 years:

Firearms safety procedures
Firearms shooting fundamentals 
Firearms Tactics   

 
Quiet on the set.......Action!
     I discussed this with my beautiful wife Sue, and obtained her outstanding support for our entire venture that has been over 1.5 years in the making. We had a vision to make this movie totally different then what is currently available to the viewing audience. We desired our movie to be both educational and entertaining by including:

Other firearm professionals sharing their vast knowledge
Embed the viewer alongside other students
A fresh and creative Director
An original musical soundtrack
A Spanish Voice Over option
Provide a beautiful backdrop


JD and Sue Williamson

Frank's remorse is short lived. Ann returns the next day fully intact with no memory of anything that happened after sex. They pick up the shagging where they left off the night before. During the night Ann transforms into a vicious demon (thanks to evil forces unleashed by the demonic wallet Frank stole) and tries to kill Frank. Frank kills Ann for a second time... the next day she comes back from the dead again…and again.In between Ann coming back from the dead and Frank killing her again, they fall in love. Together they find a way to break the curse and vanquish Nybbas, the vicious demon who controls the wallet’s power, and live happily ever after, or join the undead for good…Evil Dead meets Groundhog Day.  A Word On Special Effects""In Camera""  is the only way we can afford to do our SFX.  Cheap, fast, good- pick two.  Cheap and fast for us.

No  matter what he does or where he goes the bad guy keeps coming after him. I have been trying to make a feature film version of that idea for  twenty five years.

It’s a riveting war epic that never forgets its human characters. The focus is

<p>Your donations will go towards:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Food for the Cast and Crew</b> – we have a very talented team
bringing this film to life but it becomes difficult to tap into that talent
with empty bellies. A well-fed crew is a happy crew! </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Additional Lighting and Camera Rentals</b> – AFDA supplies us
with exceptional equipment but we would like to push the boundaries of student
filmmaking and in order to do that, we are looking at getting additional
gear</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Costumes and Make-up</b> – in order to bring the characters
to life, we need authentic costumes and realistic make-up. This will include
rebel soldier uniforms, guns, special effects make-up and fake blood.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Location and Design Costs</b> – this film is set in South Africa,
the Democratic Republic of Congo and the journey in between. We need to find the
perfect locations or create the sets and all the props that go in them.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Transportation Costs</b> – several scenes require a Jeep for
our characters to travel in as well as a bakkie (pickup truck) for the rebel
soldiers. These vehicles don’t move if you don’t fill them with petrol and you
can’t fill them with petrol if you don’t have money.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Marketing costs</b> – we would like to create DVDs,
t-shirts, hoodies, stickers, flyers, posters, business cards and anything else
we can get our hands on. This film will mean nothing without an audience
knowing it exists.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Festival Submissions</b> – we truly believe in this film and
this story. We would love for the world to see it in as many film festivals as
possible.</p>
<p>We would be incredibly grateful for absolutely any
contribution. We are offering some pretty cool perks too, so make sure to guide
your eyes to the right hand side to see what we have to offer you in return.</p>
<p>We understand that times are tough (we’re students, we understand) and
not everyone has spare money to donate. You can still help us though! <b>SHARING</b> goes
a long way. Tell your friends about us, share our campaign with them.  Anyone who can help in any way will be

</div></div>","When a quiet refugee in Johannesburg learns that his wife is
restricted from leaving the war-strewn DRC, he embarks to cross legal and moral
lines in order to evacuate her himself.




Vision:
Our vision is to create a story that is engaging and authentic.
It’s a riveting war epic that never forgets its human characters. The focus is
on one man’s struggle for his wife against the backdrop of the refugee crisis
and African Civil Wars. We’re combining styles from some of the great war-films of the decade while capturing a unique perspective on the genre. 




About the Project:BROKEN is a 24-minute short-film about Arthur, an honest Congolese refugee, who lives in South
Africa where he waits for his wife to be freed from war-strewn DRC. He works
hard for little, saving for whatever fees would be needed for his wife’s
immigration. When Arthur learns that deadly
rebels have invaded his hometown and threaten Grace, he panics. Arthur is
devastated, but he will no longer lay dormant. He uses his savings to hire an
amoral mercenary to aid him in his journey to reach his wife, at whatever cost.




BROKEN is written, directed, and
produced entirely by AFDA students as a 4th year graduation project.
AFDA, the South African School of Motion Picture Medium and Live Performance is
one of the leading film schools in South Africa. AFDA supplies us with
equipment but everything else needed for the film will be obtained by the crew
itself. 
The film will premiere in November
2016 at the AFDA Film Festival held at Ster- Kinekor Cinema Nouveau in Rosebank
Mall. We then plan to submit BROKEN to film festivals across the world and
distribute it online.

   


Your donations will go towards:
· 
Food for the Cast and Crew – we have a very talented team
bringing this film to life but it becomes difficult to tap into that talent
with empty bellies. A well-fed crew is a happy crew! 
· 
Additional Lighting and Camera Rentals – AFDA supplies us
with exceptional equipment but we would like to push the boundaries of student
filmmaking and in order to do that, we are looking at getting additional
gear
· 
Costumes and Make-up – in order to bring the characters
to life, we need authentic costumes and realistic make-up. This will include
rebel soldier uniforms, guns, special effects make-up and fake blood.
· 
Location and Design Costs – this film is set in South Africa,
the Democratic Republic of Congo and the journey in between. We need to find the
perfect locations or create the sets and all the props that go in them.
· 
Transportation Costs – several scenes require a Jeep for
our characters to travel in as well as a bakkie (pickup truck) for the rebel
soldiers. These vehicles don’t move if you don’t fill them with petrol and you
can’t fill them with petrol if you don’t have money.
· 
Marketing costs – we would like to create DVDs,
t-shirts, hoodies, stickers, flyers, posters, business cards and anything else
we can get our hands on. This film will mean nothing without an audience
knowing it exists.
· 
Festival Submissions – we truly believe in this film and
this story. We would love for the world to see it in as many film festivals as
possible.
We would be incredibly grateful for absolutely any
contribution. We are offering some pretty cool perks too, so make sure to guide
your eyes to the right hand side to see what we have to offer you in return.
We understand that times are tough (we’re students, we understand) and
not everyone has spare money to donate. You can still help us though! SHARING goes
a long way. Tell your friends about us, share our campaign with them.  Anyone who can help in any way will be
welcomed with virtual open arms.

FOLLOW and LIKE us on Facebook  and Instagram, to keep up to date with the behind the scenes of making
this film!
WE START SHOOTING ON THE 30TH OF JUNE 2016!

Ryan – Producer
Kelly Ryan is a young aspiring filmmaker and film producer from
Johannesburg, South Africa. She is currently studying towards an Honours degree
in film at AFDA School of Motion Picture Medium and Live Performance with a
major in film producing. She is passionate about telling local stories that
transcend a South African audience. She believes that at the root of any story
is an element of humanity that everyone can connect to. “A film about a person
with a completely different life to your own still manages to touch your heart
because of that humanity. And that is the beauty of filmmaking”.

<p><span>We are FMW Films, a small London-based indie film production company and we need your help!</span></p><p><span>Our latest project GODLESS is ready to shoot - please read about the project, and support us in making what we believe will be a really special short film.<br/></span></p>
<p></p><p>GODLESS is a short dark comedy. It looks at how people can 
get carried away by hype and propaganda. It will be approx 12 minutes in
 length, filmed over four days and involve some well known faces 
including:</p><p><br/></p><p>Harriet Thorpe (The Brittas Empire, Absolutely Fabulous)<br/></p><p>Richard Glover (Sightseers, A Field in England, Into the Woods)</p><p>Rachel Parris (Murder in Successville, The IT Crowd)</p><p>Simon Cotton (A Clockwork Orange Tour,  The Monster)<br/></p><p>James Wren (Peacock Season, The Trap)</p><p>Richard Sandling (Nina Forever, The Catherine Tate Show)</p><p>Akila Cristiano (Acts of Redemption)<br/></p><p><br/></p>
<b>So why do we need you? </b><span>Well,
 because we are hopefully creating something that you want - and want to 
support. Being an indie film company, it's a 
struggle to create awesome work for non-marketable reasons. This is for 
storytelling. We have brought together the best talent available to create this story that we are truly proud of.<br/></span><p>More to follow!</p><p><br/></p><h3>What is the film about?</h3><p>Trapped in their office by a baying crowd from all religious 
backgrounds, a group of filmmakers contemplate a fictional short film 
they have made disproving the existence of God. As the crowd outside

We are FMW Films, a small London-based indie film production company and we need your help!Our latest project GODLESS is ready to shoot - please read about the project, and support us in making what we believe will be a really special short film.
GODLESS is a short dark comedy. It looks at how people can 
get carried away by hype and propaganda. It will be approx 12 minutes in
 length, filmed over four days and involve some well known faces 
including:Harriet Thorpe (The Brittas Empire, Absolutely Fabulous)Richard Glover (Sightseers, A Field in England, Into the Woods)Rachel Parris (Murder in Successville, The IT Crowd)Simon Cotton (A Clockwork Orange Tour,  The Monster)James Wren (Peacock Season, The Trap)Richard Sandling (Nina Forever, The Catherine Tate Show)Akila Cristiano (Acts of Redemption)
So why do we need you? Well,
 because we are hopefully creating something that you want - and want to 
support. Being an indie film company, it's a 
struggle to create awesome work for non-marketable reasons. This is for 
storytelling. We have brought together the best talent available to create this story that we are truly proud of.More to follow!What is the film about?Trapped in their office by a baying crowd from all religious 
backgrounds, a group of filmmakers contemplate a fictional short film 
they have made disproving the existence of God. As the crowd outside 
intensifies they wonder if it is just a film or maybe something much 
more important.About us.FMW Films was set up in 2008 by Alan Freestone (Director/Writer), Fergus March (Director/Actor www.fergusmarch.co.uk) and James Wren (Actor/Writer www.jameswren.co.uk) in order to shoot the micro-budget feature PEACOCK SEASON at the Edinburgh Festival.

<p>What these funds will do is allow us to create a film that will not only be an hillarious take on the zombie genre, but it will also be a work laced with Irish charm.

<h3>We're 4160Tuesdays, makers of fine fragrance in very very small batches.</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're based on London, and handmake all our fragrances in our Acton studio.</li>
<li>Our Mrs Gloss collaboration makes it possible for group members to have their own private fragrance (but without the £5K fee).</li>
<li>By sharing the costs, and having 20 Glossers round to the studio to choose the aromas they want, we hope to make a batch of 20 - 50 litres to share among everyone who wants some.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a really good offer for everyone who'll back it before we've even made it, based on 4160Tuesdays' track record in indie fragrance.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We'd love it if you'd join in, so we can buy all the raw materials we need to make a batch of both perfumes.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our early bird rates are for everyone who's prepared to take a gamble on how the scents will turn out. (If you don'd like them, you can swap them later on the 4160Tuesdays News Facebook group.)</li>
<li>Every perfume comes with a free sample of it's other half. If you buy both, you get two free samples to share with another Glosser (or to keep :-) ).</li>
<li>Start small, with a 9ml pocket perfume, right up to 2 x 100mls.</li>
<li>We'll make the perfumes even if we don't crack the £2K target, so everyone will get their scents.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>We've done this before...</h3>
<p>As crowdfunding goes, this is pretty low risk; you will get a perfume come hell or high water, as long as we're here in once piece to make it for you.</p>
<p>We can now give you the updated notes, as we've just had our afternoon workshop to choose them</p>
<p>Outdoors: #MrsGlossMadeMeGoForAWalk -  a walk outdoors in the crisp cool winter: linden blossom for a cool top note, the forest floor smell of treemoss, the creamy slightly coconut milky scent of the octalactone molecule, warm cosy scarves.</p>
<p>Indoors: #MrsGlossMadeMeEatIt - all the wonderful scents of winter treats: tangerine, hazelnut, white cognac essential oil (a big hit, that one), red berries, amber, frankincense, and the slightest hint of toasted marshmallows.</p>
<p>The log fire smells were turned down as being a bit overpowering, spices are too irritating to use in fragrances, and we didn't want anything that was only relevant to the Christmas week; we wanted warm autumn and winter scents. </p>
<p>So now you have an idea of how they will smell. Next step is to make the first batches - the 20 people who came along will get the first smells to test for the group, and they can put their reviews on Mrs Gloss &amp; The Goss if they like.</p>
<p>There's still plenty of time to back our project. (If they turn out not to be exactly to your taste, you can always swap them on our Facebook group page.)</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","We're 4160Tuesdays, makers of fine fragrance in very very small batches.

We're based on London, and handmake all our fragrances in our Acton studio.
Our Mrs Gloss collaboration makes it possible for group members to have their own private fragrance (but without the £5K fee).
By sharing the costs, and having 20 Glossers round to the studio to choose the aromas they want, we hope to make a batch of 20 - 50 litres to share among everyone who wants some.

We have a really good offer for everyone who'll back it before we've even made it, based on 4160Tuesdays' track record in indie fragrance.

We'd love it if you'd join in, so we can buy all the raw materials we need to make a batch of both perfumes.

Our early bird rates are for everyone who's prepared to take a gamble on how the scents will turn out. (If you don'd like them, you can swap them later on the 4160Tuesdays News Facebook group.)
Every perfume comes with a free sample of it's other half. If you buy both, you get two free samples to share with another Glosser (or to keep :-) ).
Start small, with a 9ml pocket perfume, right up to 2 x 100mls.
We'll make the perfumes even if we don't crack the £2K target, so everyone will get their scents.


We've done this before...
As crowdfunding goes, this is pretty low risk; you will get a perfume come hell or high water, as long as we're here in once piece to make it for you.
We can now give you the updated notes, as we've just had our afternoon workshop to choose them
Outdoors: #MrsGlossMadeMeGoForAWalk -  a walk outdoors in the crisp cool winter: linden blossom for a cool top note, the forest floor smell of treemoss, the creamy slightly coconut milky scent of the octalactone molecule, warm cosy scarves.
Indoors: #MrsGlossMadeMeEatIt - all the wonderful scents of winter treats: tangerine, hazelnut, white cognac essential oil (a big hit, that one), red berries, amber, frankincense, and the slightest hint of toasted marshmallows.
The log fire smells were turned down as being a bit overpowering, spices are too irritating to use in fragrances, and we didn't want anything that was only relevant to the Christmas week; we wanted warm autumn and winter scents. 
So now you have an idea of how they will smell. Next step is to make the first batches - the 20 people who came along will get the first smells to test for the group, and they can put their reviews on Mrs Gloss & The Goss if they like.
There's still plenty of time to back our project. (If they turn out not to be exactly to your taste, you can always swap them on our Facebook group page.)",0.0,0,"14 Campaigns

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>EL CUENTO LARGO</h3> <p></p>
<p>(Esto es lo de arriba, pero contándoles nuestra historia, así que si nos querés conocer más leelo, si no, pues esperamos que con la info de arriba haya bastado para que donés ;) )</p>
<p><span>Hace aproximadamente 4 años, Cristóbal Serrá empezó a desarrollar un proyecto de ficción. Era algo un poco loco, tenía que ver con la Romería, grabar a esta mujer que hace la peregrinación para intentar superar un duelo. Pero el proyecto era un largometraje y parecía muy muy lejano.</span></p>
<p>Hace tres años Cristóbal y Federico, aunque se conocían desde la universidad, coincidieron en unos talleres de Cinergia, se llamaban Cine hecho a mano, y esto sembró en ambos una inquietud de hacer películas con presupuestos reducidos, y no con los millones de dólares que normalmente se requieren.</p>
<p>Pero en ese momento no había dinero, entonces Cristóbal partió a Chile y luego a España, y Federico se dedicó a hacer crecer su empresa de producción publicitaria Caramba Films.</p>
<p>El tiempo pasó, y a finales del año pasado dos factores se juntaron: Federico había decidido abrir una división de Desarrollo de Proyectos en Caramba Films y Cristóbal estaba de vuelta en Costa Rica para el Festival de Cine Paz con la Tierra. El clic fue inmediato, querían trabajar juntos.  En ese momento empezaron a hablar de “El calor después de la lluvia”, pero Cristóbal tenía que regresar a Chile a trabajar en otra película.</p>
<p>La espinita quedó ahí, y poco a poco Caramba Films fue montando una estructura de producción para desarrollar películas. El objetivo: filmar una película en el 2015.</p>
<p>De nuevo los astros se alinearon y Cristóbal regresó a Costa Rica en mayo, con una versión de guión muchísimo más elaborada. Finalmente la película estaba lista para desarrollarse.</p>
<p>Era mayo, la romería era en agosto. Dos meses y un poquito los separaban de la fecha obligatoria de rodaje, pero el compromiso del equipo era muy grande. </p>
<p>Alejandra Vargas como productora ejecutiva de Caramba Films tomó el proyecto como propio y encendió una maquinaria de producción que en 2 meses había no solo conseguido el financiamiento necesario para la película sino que tenía a 12 personas trabajando en sacar el proyecto adelante.</p>
<p>La búsqueda de locaciones estaba a un 95% lista, ya se estaba comprando vestuario y preparando props. El casting ya estaba ensayando. Se habían hecho pruebas de cámara con distintas unidades hasta que finalmente se escogió un kit que funcionaba a la perfección para la película.</p>
<p>Caramba Films con base en esas pruebas decidió invertir cerca de $20mil en equipo técnico para la producción de la película, aparte del aporte en capital que ya estaba planteado para producción y postproducción.</p>
<p>Pero todo era demasiado bueno para ser cierto. El 15 de julio, a solo 10 días de empezar a rodar, recibimos una llamada. Cuando colgamos nos llenaba un sentimiento de incertidumbre, de tristeza e inclusive de ira: un presupuesto con el que contábamos para pagar a los actores, la comida y parte del crew se había desvanecido. 15mil dólares que hacen la diferencia entre poder o no poder hacer la película.</p>
<p>Entonces queda pedir un milagro, esperar que la negrita y todos ustedes nos permitan en estos 09 días que nos quedan para empezar, poder recoger el dinero para que esta película sea realidad.</p>A la peli le quedarían todavía casi tres semanas de filmación para poder terminarse, y es por esto que existe esta campaña.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3>--- ENGLISH ---</h3>
<div>
<h3>HERE'S THE THING</h3>
<div>
<p><span>We’ve been working on this project for a few months, but Cristobal, our director, started in 2008. We did our part: our research, our fieldwork, casting, and getting every aspect for the production ready.</span></p>
<p>This year things work out so that we could make the film, with a team of 12 people working with all their energies, a strong story, and a favorable schedule, and funding for the film (this is very difficult in a place like Costa Rica). However, yesterday, just ten days before we start shooting, while Cristobal was rehearsing with our actors, everything changed… A phone call and we were 15 K USD short. It seemed like the project was impossible… but it started raining.</p>
<p>Our story is set during La Romería, a pilgrimage, towards la Negrita, a miraculous figure of Mother Mary. But more than a religious festival, the pilgrimage is also a very important cultural event. Every year, on August 2, millions of people join La Romería to visit the Negrita and ask for favors. Because we have to start shooting before event we were planning to do it on July 25, nine days from today.</p>
<p>Our team is motivated and we want to make it happen regardless of anything, now we just need a final push. Those 15K are crucial for covering food, and equipment. We need them to make our miracle happen.</p>
<p>On the side you’ll find our perks: we hope you love them, and if you don’t let us know, we can always make them better :) We are starting on July 25 because with the funding we have now we can cover the cost of one week of shooting, your support is really important so that we can finance the next three weeks. Every dollar you give means more shooting days and a better film.</p>Thanks again and let the rain begin! </div>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3><span>IT'S A LONG STORY</span></h3>
<div><span><p><span>Four years ago, Cristóbal Serrá started working on a screenplay. It sounded weird, it was about La Romería, filming a woman in her pilgrimage to deal with her mourning. The screenplay was for a feature film and at the time making it was an impossible dream. </span></p>
<p>Cristóbal and Federico met in college, but three years ago they bumped into each other in a workshop on ‘Cine hecho a mano’ [Handmade Cinema], and they both started thinking of making low budget films.</p>
<p>But back then they didn’t have the money for a low budget film. Cristóbal moved to Chile and then Spain, and Federico started Caramba Films, his own production company. </p>
<p>Last year Federico decided it was time for Caramba to start working on features and Cristóbal was back in Costa Rica for a film festival. The click happened immediately, they wanted to work together. They started talking about “El calor después de la lluvia”, but Cristóbal had to go back to Chile to work on a different film. </p>
<p>They didn’t forget the project and little by little Caramba Films started working towards filming a feature in 2015. Things came together, Cristóbal came back with an improved screenplay and the film was ready to be made.</p>
<p>It was May, and La Romería is in August. We had two months and some days until the shooting and we were all committed to make it happen! </p>
<p>Alejandra Vargas as executive producer of Caramba Films loved the project and got things started. In two months she had the funding and a consolidated team of 12 people. </p>
<p>Location scouting was almost done, we were buying costumes and making props. The was cast rehearsing and we were playing around with different cameras until we chose the right one for the project.  Caramba Films invested more than $20K in technical equipment only, without including the funding that was already raised for production and postproduction.</p>
<p>But it sounded too good to be true. On July 15, ten days before our first shooting date, we got a call. When the called finished we were uncertain about the future of the project. We were planning to use the funding to pay actors, food, and part of the crew. Our dream seemed almost impossible. 15K dollars makes a big difference in being able to shoot a film or not. </p>
<p>There was nothing left than asking for a miracle. And waiting for La Negrita, and all of you to be able to fundraise what we need to make the film real! </p>
<p>We still have three weeks more of shooting, and that’s why we started this campaign.</p></span></div>

Hace aproximadamente 4 años, Cristóbal Serrá empezó a desarrollar un proyecto de ficción. Era algo un poco loco, tenía que ver con la Romería, grabar a esta mujer que hace la peregrinación para intentar superar un duelo. Pero el proyecto era un largometraje y parecía muy muy lejano.
Hace tres años Cristóbal y Federico, aunque se conocían desde la universidad, coincidieron en unos talleres de Cinergia, se llamaban Cine hecho a mano, y esto sembró en ambos una inquietud de hacer películas con presupuestos reducidos, y no con los millones de dólares que normalmente se requieren.
Pero en ese momento no había dinero, entonces Cristóbal partió a Chile y luego a España, y Federico se dedicó a hacer crecer su empresa de producción publicitaria Caramba Films.
El tiempo pasó, y a finales del año pasado dos factores se juntaron: Federico había decidido abrir una división de Desarrollo de Proyectos en Caramba Films y Cristóbal estaba de vuelta en Costa Rica para el Festival de Cine Paz con la Tierra. El clic fue inmediato, querían trabajar juntos.  En ese momento empezaron a hablar de “El calor después de la lluvia”, pero Cristóbal tenía que regresar a Chile a trabajar en otra película.
La espinita quedó ahí, y poco a poco Caramba Films fue montando una estructura de producción para desarrollar películas. El objetivo: filmar una película en el 2015.
De nuevo los astros se alinearon y Cristóbal regresó a Costa Rica en mayo, con una versión de guión muchísimo más elaborada. Finalmente la película estaba lista para desarrollarse.
Era mayo, la romería era en agosto. Dos meses y un poquito los separaban de la fecha obligatoria de rodaje, pero el compromiso del equipo era muy grande. 
Alejandra Vargas como productora ejecutiva de Caramba Films tomó el proyecto como propio y encendió una maquinaria de producción que en 2 meses había no solo conseguido el financiamiento necesario para la película sino que tenía a 12 personas trabajando en sacar el proyecto adelante.
La búsqueda de locaciones estaba a un 95% lista, ya se estaba comprando vestuario y preparando props. El casting ya estaba ensayando. Se habían hecho pruebas de cámara con distintas unidades hasta que finalmente se escogió un kit que funcionaba a la perfección para la película.
Caramba Films con base en esas pruebas decidió invertir cerca de $20mil en equipo técnico para la producción de la película, aparte del aporte en capital que ya estaba planteado para producción y postproducción.
Pero todo era demasiado bueno para ser cierto. El 15 de julio, a solo 10 días de empezar a rodar, recibimos una llamada. Cuando colgamos nos llenaba un sentimiento de incertidumbre, de tristeza e inclusive de ira: un presupuesto con el que contábamos para pagar a los actores, la comida y parte del crew se había desvanecido. 15mil dólares que hacen la diferencia entre poder o no poder hacer la película.
Entonces queda pedir un milagro, esperar que la negrita y todos ustedes nos permitan en estos 09 días que nos quedan para empezar, poder recoger el dinero para que esta película sea realidad.A la peli le quedarían todavía casi tres semanas de filmación para poder terminarse, y es por esto que existe esta campaña.

HERE'S THE THING

We’ve been working on this project for a few months, but Cristobal, our director, started in 2008. We did our part: our research, our fieldwork, casting, and getting every aspect for the production ready.
This year things work out so that we could make the film, with a team of 12 people working with all their energies, a strong story, and a favorable schedule, and funding for the film (this is very difficult in a place like Costa Rica). However, yesterday, just ten days before we start shooting, while Cristobal was rehearsing with our actors, everything changed… A phone call and we were 15 K USD short. It seemed like the project was impossible… but it started raining.
Our story is set during La Romería, a pilgrimage, towards la Negrita, a miraculous figure of Mother Mary. But more than a religious festival, the pilgrimage is also a very important cultural event. Every year, on August 2, millions of people join La Romería to visit the Negrita and ask for favors. Because we have to start shooting before event we were planning to do it on July 25, nine days from today.
Our team is motivated and we want to make it happen regardless of anything, now we just need a final push. Those 15K are crucial for covering food, and equipment. We need them to make our miracle happen.
On the side you’ll find our perks: we hope you love them, and if you don’t let us know, we can always make them better :) We are starting on July 25 because with the funding we have now we can cover the cost of one week of shooting, your support is really important so that we can finance the next three weeks. Every dollar you give means more shooting days and a better film.Thanks again and let the rain begin! 


IT'S A LONG STORY
Four years ago, Cristóbal Serrá started working on a screenplay. It sounded weird, it was about La Romería, filming a woman in her pilgrimage to deal with her mourning. The screenplay was for a feature film and at the time making it was an impossible dream. 
Cristóbal and Federico met in college, but three years ago they bumped into each other in a workshop on ‘Cine hecho a mano’ [Handmade Cinema], and they both started thinking of making low budget films.
But back then they didn’t have the money for a low budget film. Cristóbal moved to Chile and then Spain, and Federico started Caramba Films, his own production company. 
Last year Federico decided it was time for Caramba to start working on features and Cristóbal was back in Costa Rica for a film festival. The click happened immediately, they wanted to work together. They started talking about “El calor después de la lluvia”, but Cristóbal had to go back to Chile to work on a different film. 
They didn’t forget the project and little by little Caramba Films started working towards filming a feature in 2015. Things came together, Cristóbal came back with an improved screenplay and the film was ready to be made.
It was May, and La Romería is in August. We had two months and some days until the shooting and we were all committed to make it happen! 
Alejandra Vargas as executive producer of Caramba Films loved the project and got things started. In two months she had the funding and a consolidated team of 12 people. 
Location scouting was almost done, we were buying costumes and making props. The was cast rehearsing and we were playing around with different cameras until we chose the right one for the project.  Caramba Films invested more than $20K in technical equipment only, without including the funding that was already raised for production and postproduction.
But it sounded too good to be true. On July 15, ten days before our first shooting date, we got a call. When the called finished we were uncertain about the future of the project. We were planning to use the funding to pay actors, food, and part of the crew. Our dream seemed almost impossible. 15K dollars makes a big difference in being able to shoot a film or not. 
There was nothing left than asking for a miracle. And waiting for La Negrita, and all of you to be able to fundraise what we need to make the film real! 
We still have three weeks more of shooting, and that’s why we started this campaign.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p>Film <b>Maleš</b> je važan zato što istražuje jedan začudan svet porodice u
kojoj ukorenjenost tradicije sa Balkanskih prostora zatvara sva vrata za
budućnost. To je tema koja je jako malo obrađena u ovdašnjoj kinematografiji, i
zbog toga predstavlja izazov.</p>
<p>
</p><p><i>U muškom svetu,<span>  žena koja ne podari naslednika,  biva izgnana ili sama odabere
izgnanstvo. Glavna junakinja filma Maleš je sa sobom u krajnje izgnanstvo
povela i svoje tri ćerke.  </span></i></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">KONTEKST</h2>
<p>Balkan, mesto eksplozivnog susreta
istoka i zapada. Poslednji krak orijenta i postapokaliptični cvet zlatnog
socijalizma. Tlo na kojem niču nesvakidašnje porodice. Mesto gde je produžetak
porodične loze najveća obaveza žene. </p>

U ovoj priči, na prvi
pogled se čini da je ovde sve normalno, iako zapravo ništa nije. Cela situacija
izmiče kontroli na 19. rođendan najmlađe ćerke, kada  borba majke dostiže
vrhunac i fijasko istovremeno. <p>
<b>Ovo je
priča o jednom svetu koji nestaje, svetu koji čine četiri žene, rastrzane
između velike želje za produženjem loze i slobode koju poznaju samo u mašti. <br/></b></p><p><b>

This is a topic that is little  treated in the local cinema, and therefore represents a challenge.In a man’s world, a woman who decides not to give posterity, gets exiled
 or chooses exile herself. Mother, heroine of the film MALESH, chose an 
ultimate exile, taking her three daughters with her.*Serbian version below / Srpska verzija teksta nalazi se ispod

CONTEXTBalkans, a place of explosive encounters of East and West. The last ray of orient and post-apocalyptic flower of the golden socialism. Ground sprouting unordinary families. Place where the extension of the family line is a woman’s biggest responsibility. In this story, although seemingly normal at first, nothing truly is. The
 situation goes out of control at the youngest daughter’s 19th birthday,
 when Mother's struggle comes to its peak, as well as its fiasco at the 
same time. 

This is a story of a vanishing world, a world made of four women, torn between an undeniable desire for family extension, and the freedom they are familiar with only in their imagination. 
Film’s director Ivan Bakrač and screenwriter Bane Jevtić, along with DP Dušan Grubin and production designer Dragana Baćović, are a well-coordinated team working on their fourth mutual film. They’ve been working on film MALESH for almost a year now.
From the idea, to the script development and carefully chosen cast that are, as authors agree, unique in their authenticity, being the only ones that can create this layered story, its symbolism, as well as aesthetics, film MALESH is a one of a kind project asking for your support!
With your help, we can achieve so much with this film. Your contribution will be supporting a truly incredible team of filmmakers, from budding artists to established, award-winning creators. We truly believe this is a team you'll want to get behind.

CAST
Sonja Vukićević, a legendary Serbian ballet dancer, a choreographer and director and a life lover.
""As soon as I read Bane’s script, firstly I laughed my ass off, and then cried my eyes out over the life of the woman I was supposed to play. I’m looking forward to working with Bane since he made his first acting steps in my theater troupe exactly 15 years ago.""Bebi Dol, the biggest pop star in Yugoslavia in the last 30 years. ""Film Malesh is quite a challenge for me because it offers layering for dreaming up, as well as for the exciting play. I accepted a film role after a few decades since my last one and I chose this story cause I immediately fell in love with the script and the crew.""Hristina Popović, one of Serbia’s most popular actresses.
""This story is unique mostly because it differs from all of the films shot in the last several years, and this role is something I haven’t done or read before.""Maja Šuša, popular Serbian actress of the youngest generation.""I worked with Ivan and Bane on their previous film, and I am honored to be in this company. I can’t wait for the shooting to begin! ""

ABOUT AUTHORS Ivan Bakrač and Bane Jevtić began their collaboration in 2010 on Bakrač’s graduation film called “A Small, Good Thing“. Two years later, in 2012, Ivan Bakrač made film “Wars”, based on the motives of Adam Haslett’s short story. A year later, in 2013, Ivan decided to shoot a short film based on the 
story and screenplay of Bane. Give the name of the film ""Our skin is 
going to gray"".Bane Jevtić, an actor, writer and painter, was born in Belgrade, Serbia in 1978. After graduating acting, Bane played in almost every Belgrade theater, spreading his acting experiences on films, as well as television. Writing has been a passion of his for several years, while his screenwriting debut happened in 2013, for a film “Our skin is going to gray”, for which he even received a Best Script Award at 2014 Bašta Fest. At the moment, he is preparing a collection of short stories, as well as a script for his first feature-length film.Screenwriter’s ExplicationAfter reflecting for a very long time on the notion of freedom here and today, avoiding generalization and making it quite personal, I came up to an idea of writing some kind of my confession regarding this so wanted freedom I only have in theory. This tendency towards an ultimate freedom is ultimately the one creating prison.Story’s core is a pathological ambition of realizing an idea whose premise is wrong, unquestionably bringing the story’s hero to the downfall, as well as sacrificing everything she has, in this case her whole family, for the sake of something unattainable. Ivan Bakrač, born in Nikšić, Montenegro in 1987. He received his Masters degree in Film Directing at Faculty of Arts and Design. He directed several short and medium-length films, also working as a screenwriter, editor and producer. His films have been included in numerous international film festivals. Bakrač is this year’s participator of the Berlinale Talents program, as well as Talents Sarajevo. He is currently working on his first feature-length film.Director’s ExplicationBane Jevtić’s script, besides its originality, caught my attention mostly because of its extremely unique and realistic atmosphere, creating a fantastic visual potential. This script offered me numerous possibilities for exploration, playing with forms, media etc. As a result, we are given the opportunity to create one specific world that looks different from the ones we’ve had the chance of seeing in previous short films.Ivan's and Bane's collaborations: Film WARS Bane Jevtić was collaborator on the script.The film ""Wars"" was noticed in a lot of international festivals, and some of them are:* Kustendorf International Film Festival (Premiere)* Athens International Film + Video Festival, Ohio (Oscar Qualifying)*

Film Maleš je važan zato što istražuje jedan začudan svet porodice u
kojoj ukorenjenost tradicije sa Balkanskih prostora zatvara sva vrata za
budućnost. To je tema koja je jako malo obrađena u ovdašnjoj kinematografiji, i
zbog toga predstavlja izazov.

U muškom svetu,  žena koja ne podari naslednika,  biva izgnana ili sama odabere
izgnanstvo. Glavna junakinja filma Maleš je sa sobom u krajnje izgnanstvo
povela i svoje tri ćerke.  
KONTEKST
Balkan, mesto eksplozivnog susreta
istoka i zapada. Poslednji krak orijenta i postapokaliptični cvet zlatnog
socijalizma. Tlo na kojem niču nesvakidašnje porodice. Mesto gde je produžetak
porodične loze najveća obaveza žene. 

U ovoj priči, na prvi
pogled se čini da je ovde sve normalno, iako zapravo ništa nije. Cela situacija
izmiče kontroli na 19. rođendan najmlađe ćerke, kada  borba majke dostiže
vrhunac i fijasko istovremeno. 
Ovo je
priča o jednom svetu koji nestaje, svetu koji čine četiri žene, rastrzane
između velike želje za produženjem loze i slobode koju poznaju samo u mašti. 
Reditelj Ivan Bakrač
i scenarista Bane Jevtić su sa
direktorom fotografije Dušanom Grubinom
i scenografkinjom Draganom Baćović
uigrana ekipa kojoj je ovo četvrti
zajednički film, a na filmu Maleš
zajedno rade već skoro godinu dana.
Od ideje, preko izrade scenarija, do pažljivo odabranih glumica
koje su, po rečima autora, jedinstvene u svojoj autentičnosti, i kao takve
jedine koju mogu da iznesu ovu slojevitu priču, simboliku, ali i estetiku.
PODLEA
Sonja Vukićević je čuvena
balerina, koreograf i reditelj koja život posmatra širom otvorenih očiju.
„Čim sam pročitala Banetov scenario, prvo sam se sita ismejala, a  onda sam se rasplakala nad životom žene
koju bi trebalo da igram. Jako se radujem saradnji sa Banetom jer je on prve
glumačke korake napravio u mojoj pozorišnoj trupi pre tačno 15 godina“
Bebi
Dol,
najveća pop zvezda u Jugoslaviji u poslednjih 30 godina.
„Film Maleš je za mene izazov jer nudi
slojevitost kako za razmaštavanje, tako i za uzbudljivu igru. Nakon nekoliko
decenija sam prihvatila ulogu na filmu, jer sam se u scenario i u ekipu
zaljubila na prvo gledanje” 
Hristina Popović, trenutno
jedna od najpopularnijih glumica u Srbiji.
„Ova
priča je jedinstvena pre svega po tome što se razlikuje od svih
kinematografskih u poslednjih nekoliko godina, a moja uloga je nešto sa čim se
nisam do sada susretala“
Maja Šuša, popularna glumica
najmlađe generacije.
„Sa Ivanom i Banetom sam sarađivala na njihovom prethodnom filmu, čast mi je
što sam u ovom društvu i odbrojavam dane do početka snimanja” O AUTORIMA

FOOD: $1400.00

IMPACT
This film is a culmination of what we have learned and our talents.  We consider this our first step into the world of film.  We are showing the world who we are and at the same time putting a smile on the faces of our audience.  If all this film does is make someone laugh, it will be a success.

<p><strong>The Synopsis of Lost Gurl</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Lost Gurl” is the
story about<span> a 17 year old girl named Nola
who falls in love with a 24 year old Man named Jay.  Early in the story we see that Nola runs away
from home and moves in with Jay.  Nola
believes everything is great until Jay's true identity reveals its self. Nola is
then put through physical and mental abuse that no woman, especially a girl
should ever experience. </span></p>
<p><b>The Purpose</b><br/></p>
</div> <div> The purpose of “Lost
Gurl” is to depict the true to life story of what happens when a young woman is
negatively influenced by and older man. I believe that this film will be used
to creatively show some of the struggles that young women face during their
search for love. I believe that this film can be a powerful tool that can teach
young women about the dangers of foolish love, and show the world the impact of
domestic violence and abuse.

   </div><div>Lost Gurl can be compared to films like  ""The inevitable defeat of Mister and Pete."" and ""Precious"" Two great films which show the impact of living in the urban environment. </div><div><br/></div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437089692/jhwib63ppp9qshwhy6pa.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 247.13px; height: 370px;""/>             </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437089797/ckc0pe09pa0pcgx9gbhd.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 250px; height: 375px;""/><br/></p><div>

The Impact

On the surface, RooMcGoo is about telling stories through songs, and sharing songs that tell stories. However, contributors should know that RooMcGoo represents and will strive to uphold the following Core Values: 

What unites us is stronger than what divides us. No one is better or worse than anyone else, even if they are different, and everyone should get to feel comfortable being themselves. 
The internet age has brought with it incredible opportunities to connect, but also a new sense of disconnection, and it is time to begin bridging this gap. 
Everyone is a creative person in their own way, and everyone deserves to have their creativity shared, and their story heard. 
Musical comedy should be accessible to everyone, regardless of education, geography, or cultural background. 

Risks & Challenges

The Main Challenge: What makes Roo's content special? 

My Strategy:  I reformatted my site to feature stories and songs in a structure I have yet to see online -  the stories (articles) provide thoughtful, witty context for the songs (musical) videos, and also include links to any non-RooMcGoo generated content which inspired the story/song of that post, combining these elements to become a whole greater than the sum of its parts. 

Another Big Challenge: How can you maintain steady output of new digi-content while simultaneously producing live components?

My Strategy: I began shooting footage for the Inauguroo Season 9 months ago, and have workshopped first rounds of the ""A New Musical""(in 2013) and ""Roo-ining Christmas"" (in 2014) webseries' to tighten all production phases for maximum efficiency, and establish a team of core collaborators. Similarly, I workshopped live screenings and comedy shows in the past year, practicing exactly how the web content can feed into a live component. 

And, just for fun, A Big Risk: What if this doesn't take off, nobody watches anything, and you don't get on Ellen?

My Strategy: Over time, with consistent content being released, I know the message of RooMcGoo will attract its own audience. Still, I cannot guarantee that any content produced & released by RooMcGoo will go ""viral"" or get anyone on Ellen (though, DUH, that would be pretty cool). What I can guarantee is, with your support, content will continue to be released regularly as long as there is a large audience for stories and songs. 

    Other Ways You Can Help If you have no money, fret not- neither do I! I completely understand! You can still support Roo, for froo:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, there. We are the team behind the upcoming short film, <i>Impermanence</i>.  The feature takes place in the near future where everyone's conversations are recorded through a device called CORTEX. CORTEX is an implant that records every conversation the host has, enabling them to re-live their fondest memoires.  The story focuses on Ellen March, a surveillance officer who uses CORTEX to find those who took the most important thing from her. </p>
<p>Our aim for the film is to create an emotionally layered narrative, that is both authentic and futuristic, where you follow Ellen on her journey to seek redemption and piece the puzzle together yourselves. </p>
<p>The story came about through writer and sound designer Peter Elsmere, who has always felt that sound was the untold hero within cinema and hasn't gained enough recognition, compared to its visual counterpart. </p>
<h3>Meet the Team </h3>
<p><strong>Director - Callum Sexton </strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615305884/kkkwydj3maloj0rarjdl.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I think about film I think of creativity, commitment and team work. Growing up it was always my passion to work within the film industry and have been lucky enough to experience the thrill of productions first hand. As an actor I feel that my experience within the world of acting has allowed me to input those skills to the role of directing due to the fact I know exactly how a director needs to present himself and his ideas in order to achieve the maximum resemblance to our script/story. I grew up taking inspiration from British actors such as Daniel Radcliffe, whilst also admiring the emergence of Tom Holland. Directing wise Steven Spielberg heavily stood out to me whilst admiring the historic work of the likes of Kubrick and Hitchcock.</p>
<p><b>Writer and Sound Designer - Peter Elsmere</b></p>
<p><b> </b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614860924/h3bohvmsl1wukicixiub.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>“When thinking about my passion for film and how it is has affected my life, sound has played a major role within that and since being at University that passion has only grown. With this in mind, I wanted to write a project that drew upon the importance of sound within film.  Inspired by films such as Memento and Miniority Report, the film at its core is about memories, and how we hold things close to us, particularly when dealing with grief. However, instead of the visuals providing the majority of the information like most other films, my aim is to work alongside the Cinematographer and create an audio-visual journey that is pleasing on the eyes but also, on the ears. This film is very deer to me and something that I have wanted to make for a while. I look forward to showing it to you in near the future.”  </p>
<p><strong>Producer - Pete Bustin</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615480929/x3jhqairxwaxfqwjvatp.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> As a film student I love films in a dystopian setting such as Blade Runner and The Platform which heavily inspires some of the locations and props we’ll use throughout our production to create a similar cinematic aesthetic within our film. We aim to have a diverse cast and motifs that immerse the audience with within our film and create the ambiance of a dystopian future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cinematographer - Sam Costa</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615308314/clx8mnq0mteg0nrlpuny.png"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>“As a child, I was raised on classic sci-fi and action films: Star Wars, Back to the Future, The Matrix; and since then these films and, this genre as a whole, has a very special place in my heart. So, when I heard the pitch for Impermanence, I was instantly hooked and I knew this is the film I wanted to work on. Not only because of the thrilling science fiction world and narrative, but I’m also a sucker for deep emotional stories and layered characters, and Impermanence’s script has that in abundance. Having grown up around family and friends who were photographers and videographers, I have always had a passion and fascination for working behind the camera. And having already some experience as a cinematographer, I think my skills are at a good enough level for me to be able to experiment with a range of different ideas and techniques to make our audience feel engaged in our world. We can’t wait to show you guys what we’ve been working on!”</p>

<p>Studying music, I primarily specialise in Jazz, Rock and Fusion but have a love for Film and TV scoring. After many year of playing the guitar, I have found it necessary to learn a range of instruments to aid me in my creations e.g. Saxophone, Piano, Percussion and the Greek Bouzouki. I’m so excited to be working on this film!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need and What do you get? </h3>
<p>Our budget is quite small, as we have had to scale back the film due to the pandemic. However, as a team we have discussed about how we can make the most out of the money, which can be seen in the chart below: </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615557275/z17ryypcbhbtb55vyzpk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We want to make this film look and feel cinematic as much as possible, which is why we believe set design will play a key role in this. As you can see, Actors takes up a lot of our budget, this is because we would like to be able to pay the actors for their fantastic work. However, without you, this won't be possible.</p>
<p>If you believe in this production and want to help in the creation of the project, we have some really good perks that you can claim such as limited edition posters. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>Impermanence </i>is a powerful story about dealing with ones own grief but it also explores themes of corruption within society.  Most importantly though, it is an original feature that focuses on emotions and even though the film is fictionalised, the story itself is personal to us all. The importance of family is ever present within the film.</p>
<p>The focus around a female narrative voice has real importance. We feel that cinema focuses on male narratives and predominantly serves a male audience. This needs to change.  Supporting this film is where you can help make this change happen. </p>
<p>We are really passionate filmmakers, who have long term ambitions to work within the industry but due to the pandemic, we have had limited chances to build our filmmaking portfolio. In supporting this campaign, you will not only help out third year students on their final project, but help build our show reel. This will enable us to apply the film to film festivals and gain recognition. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main challenge we are still to face is the set design of the film.  Due to the pandemic, we haven't been able to physically go to the locations and work out what the scene will look like. However, through the programme <i>Set.A.Light,</i> we have created lighting and set design concepts of how they will look.  Here are a couple of examples. </p>
<p> </p>

<p>The pictures above are Ellen investigating audio files. </p>
<p>Working of our aim of authenticity, we want to create a futuristic style to this film that needs a lot more care and attention to detail. </p>
<p>Also, with limited resources and money, we were able to create an essence of what we want to create in our final film via our trailer. </p>

<ul>
<li>Masks worn by crew at all times and actors when they are not in front of the camera.</li>
<li>Social distancing on set wherever possible.</li>
<li>Hand Sanitiser points will be positioned around the set. </li>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello, there. We are the team behind the upcoming short film, Impermanence.  The feature takes place in the near future where everyone's conversations are recorded through a device called CORTEX. CORTEX is an implant that records every conversation the host has, enabling them to re-live their fondest memoires.  The story focuses on Ellen March, a surveillance officer who uses CORTEX to find those who took the most important thing from her. 
Our aim for the film is to create an emotionally layered narrative, that is both authentic and futuristic, where you follow Ellen on her journey to seek redemption and piece the puzzle together yourselves. 
The story came about through writer and sound designer Peter Elsmere, who has always felt that sound was the untold hero within cinema and hasn't gained enough recognition, compared to its visual counterpart. 
Meet the Team 
Director - Callum Sexton 

 
When I think about film I think of creativity, commitment and team work. Growing up it was always my passion to work within the film industry and have been lucky enough to experience the thrill of productions first hand. As an actor I feel that my experience within the world of acting has allowed me to input those skills to the role of directing due to the fact I know exactly how a director needs to present himself and his ideas in order to achieve the maximum resemblance to our script/story. I grew up taking inspiration from British actors such as Daniel Radcliffe, whilst also admiring the emergence of Tom Holland. Directing wise Steven Spielberg heavily stood out to me whilst admiring the historic work of the likes of Kubrick and Hitchcock.
Writer and Sound Designer - Peter Elsmere
 
“When thinking about my passion for film and how it is has affected my life, sound has played a major role within that and since being at University that passion has only grown. With this in mind, I wanted to write a project that drew upon the importance of sound within film.  Inspired by films such as Memento and Miniority Report, the film at its core is about memories, and how we hold things close to us, particularly when dealing with grief. However, instead of the visuals providing the majority of the information like most other films, my aim is to work alongside the Cinematographer and create an audio-visual journey that is pleasing on the eyes but also, on the ears. This film is very deer to me and something that I have wanted to make for a while. I look forward to showing it to you in near the future.”  
Producer - Pete Bustin

 As a film student I love films in a dystopian setting such as Blade Runner and The Platform which heavily inspires some of the locations and props we’ll use throughout our production to create a similar cinematic aesthetic within our film. We aim to have a diverse cast and motifs that immerse the audience with within our film and create the ambiance of a dystopian future.
 
Cinematographer - Sam Costa
 
“As a child, I was raised on classic sci-fi and action films: Star Wars, Back to the Future, The Matrix; and since then these films and, this genre as a whole, has a very special place in my heart. So, when I heard the pitch for Impermanence, I was instantly hooked and I knew this is the film I wanted to work on. Not only because of the thrilling science fiction world and narrative, but I’m also a sucker for deep emotional stories and layered characters, and Impermanence’s script has that in abundance. Having grown up around family and friends who were photographers and videographers, I have always had a passion and fascination for working behind the camera. And having already some experience as a cinematographer, I think my skills are at a good enough level for me to be able to experiment with a range of different ideas and techniques to make our audience feel engaged in our world. We can’t wait to show you guys what we’ve been working on!”
 
Music - Jordan​ Milopoulos

Studying music, I primarily specialise in Jazz, Rock and Fusion but have a love for Film and TV scoring. After many year of playing the guitar, I have found it necessary to learn a range of instruments to aid me in my creations e.g. Saxophone, Piano, Percussion and the Greek Bouzouki. I’m so excited to be working on this film!

What We Need and What do you get? 
Our budget is quite small, as we have had to scale back the film due to the pandemic. However, as a team we have discussed about how we can make the most out of the money, which can be seen in the chart below: 

 
We want to make this film look and feel cinematic as much as possible, which is why we believe set design will play a key role in this. As you can see, Actors takes up a lot of our budget, this is because we would like to be able to pay the actors for their fantastic work. However, without you, this won't be possible.
If you believe in this production and want to help in the creation of the project, we have some really good perks that you can claim such as limited edition posters. 
 

The Impact
Impermanence is a powerful story about dealing with ones own grief but it also explores themes of corruption within society.  Most importantly though, it is an original feature that focuses on emotions and even though the film is fictionalised, the story itself is personal to us all. The importance of family is ever present within the film.
The focus around a female narrative voice has real importance. We feel that cinema focuses on male narratives and predominantly serves a male audience. This needs to change.  Supporting this film is where you can help make this change happen. 
We are really passionate filmmakers, who have long term ambitions to work within the industry but due to the pandemic, we have had limited chances to build our filmmaking portfolio. In supporting this campaign, you will not only help out third year students on their final project, but help build our show reel. This will enable us to apply the film to film festivals and gain recognition. 
 

Risks & Challenges
The main challenge we are still to face is the set design of the film.  Due to the pandemic, we haven't been able to physically go to the locations and work out what the scene will look like. However, through the programme Set.A.Light, we have created lighting and set design concepts of how they will look.  Here are a couple of examples. 
 


The pictures above are from an interrogation style scene. 

 

The pictures above are Ellen investigating audio files. 
Working of our aim of authenticity, we want to create a futuristic style to this film that needs a lot more care and attention to detail. 
Also, with limited resources and money, we were able to create an essence of what we want to create in our final film via our trailer. 
Joining our Campaign 
As a team, we are really excited about making this project and can't wait to share the experience with you. There are many ways to help bringing this film to life: 

Donate any money you can to reach our goal through the different perks.
Following us on social media, which you can find at the bottom of the page.
Sharing this page whether you can. Friends, Family, Work Colleagues whoever, we really appreciate it.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>CALL IT LOVE is an intimate character study of a lonely young woman who believes a match she made on a dating app is the saving grace to her isolated lifestyle.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>The story follows Vaughn, a naive young woman who has been socially isolated throughout her adult life. Raised in a conservative southern community, Vaughn made the move to Los Angeles to live a life she felt she would have been denied back home. Unfortunately, her timing was off, and she moved just before the pandemic struck. Her isolation compounded by quarantine and not knowing another soul in LA, Vaughn’s only source of companionship is confined to the dating app on her phone.</p>

<p>Enter Parker — a self-assured woman and dating app veteran, who knows exactly what she wants and how to get it. After matching with Parker, Vaughn manifests a carefully elaborated fantasy in her mind about how the relationship will play out, skipping far ahead into a delusion before even meeting Parker in real life.</p>
<p>When Parker fails to show up for their date, Vaughn is sent into a tailspin where she confronts not only the depths of her obsession, but the object of her obsession, as well. The harsh truth behind their relationship is soon revealed, leaving Vaughn unable to comprehend the idea of a world where Parker ends up with anyone other than herself...</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While this is a fictional story, it navigates universal experiences about loneliness and the desire to share an honest connection with other people, as well as the question of how legitimate online relationships really are. It is also told through a creative lens that is unique to the experiences shared by members of our production team who belong to the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

<ul>
<li>Camera/General Equipment</li>
<li>Locations</li>
<li>Cast and Crew</li>
<li>COVID Safety </li>
</ul>
<p>One of our biggest unexpected costs is ensuring that our production is safe during the pandemic, which means buying personal protective equipment for our team, supplying individual water bottles as well as individual pre-packaged snacks and meals, sanitizing sets as well as commonly used props, limiting crew members at our indoor locations and ensuring that everyone keeps up with our testing policies. We're committed to following all of the posted film guidelines and implementing our own practices to keep a safe set environment.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">In order to clarify the procedures for collecting and investment business, we highlight and respond to your questions and doubts:</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">- Research and development does not affect the ""drones toy"", but a more ambitious project that will allow us to evolve the drones ""starwars"", from toy drones, drones to professional;</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">- Drones toy are built with existing technology and using 3D printer to produce the shell model starwars. Only we adapt the technology to the shape of ships. No need for specialized investments in research and development, and we can also provide only a few products, even if the campaign does not raise the total requested could.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">So no problem and concern for the failure to supply the drone ordered present among the perks, in any case will be produced and delivered. We are already producing and printing the first units that will soon be on-line;</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">A) WAL SYSTEM: In about ambitious project of R &amp; D for the construction of a communication system that can allow the drone to move, both in water and on land and in the air, piloted remotely, we note that there are already several research institutes who are facing trial, us with the funds raised could develop independent research, or co-finance the one already in progress. The decision to make our R&amp;A, or in affiliation with a research center, will depend on the extent of the amount raised. If this sum, as we have requested will be consistent, we could be the ones to develop the prototype and patenting;</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">B) SPACE TURISM: With regard instead to space tourism, it is clearly a dream, however, based on the amounts collected could decide to unite our efforts in the activities of other companies that are investing in the sector and contribute to the implementation of the consocenza technology. Whether the sums will be particularly strong we could develop activities and prototypes directly also saving patent.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">I think part of the questions I have been asked this description are clearer, but I intend to further integrate the description, that also thanks to your comments we are completing the communication point of view.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">in a short time we would insert also the first official products.</p>

<p>We start with a game, creating small drones, which are high-tech toys because they like performance drone professional.</p>
<p>Once created the imperial army of Starwars, we would do shows continuous swarming for the cinema, and would continue to produce models for our fans and fans of starwars.</p>
<p>Replicheremmo probably, with the success of the first campaign, also campaigns for other models of drones.</p>
<p>The purpose and scale of the game, to reality, with a first draft of research and development launched during the campaign to complete studies and research conducted at the university in order to create a real spaceship. This is clearly the research project, for its production then would assess whether to launch a special campaign or get other types of financial resources as both the nasa that other private companies (Elon Musk) are investing in space tourism, we could assist our resources to them.</p>
<p>Target a nice trip into space with all our CROWDFUNDER, and for those who do not believe, would send a thought from the moon when we land with our super 3° BLACK DEATH SHIP</p>

SHORT PRESENTATIONIF YOU DO NOT WANT TO READ ALL HISTORY, A SUMMARY HERE ARE IN ITALIAN AND ENGLISHSE NON AVETE VOGLIA DI LEGGERE TUTTA LA STORIA,  QUI TROVATE  UN RIASSUNTO IN ITALIANO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4po7yfSNjshttp://youtu.be/_qJqb7JkqcU     STORYWHO WE AREThe campaign is lunched by Wic Venture Capital trust Fund Inc., an american new accelerator of business. With the technical help of Paolo and Emanuele.Paolo:Hello, I am Paolo Bianchi, an Italian aeronautical engineer , I have worked in AMERICA, DETROIT 2012-2014, and now I work with WIC VENTURE CAPITAL TRUST FUND INC, for lunching this CAMPAIGN. The campaign will be carried out only after defining an agreement with Walt's about copyright, that amount will be proportionate to the collection obtained and the margins on production costs. I think that if materials collection will be important as we requested, there will be all the numbers to meet the needs of fans.You can see me,  in the photos, while working in production and sale of drones, also created by me. I worked for Detroit Aircarft, where I really hope to come back, and I work with still for sale the drone professional inquired of LOCKHEED MARTIN in europe.Emanuele:Is a technician of information technology, and here he works on his PC in the software developement.WIC Fund,  would like to develop this first project, which is very ambitious to go in the space, with a real spaceship with my CRODWFUNDER, and to do this I have to start from something small but fun, and I thought, since I am a FAN of Startwars to fly the sheet of  GALACTIC EMPIRE , integrating element for a high-tech for those who want the system more efficient ( WAL)http://youtu.be/m-hSPycReQ4  - http://youtu.be/_qJqb7JkqcUITALIAN VERSIONhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zlCRT2M-kkENGLISH VERSIONEThe first step  August / September 2015, and that you will be shown on-line so as to keep you updated on the development of production, is to get to the completion of the prototype mounting the undercarriage of the drone DEATH STARINVESTMENT MODE - COLLECTION SYSTEM - DELIVERY 


In order to clarify the procedures for collecting and investment business, we highlight and respond to your questions and doubts:
- Research and development does not affect the ""drones toy"", but a more ambitious project that will allow us to evolve the drones ""starwars"", from toy drones, drones to professional;
- Drones toy are built with existing technology and using 3D printer to produce the shell model starwars. Only we adapt the technology to the shape of ships. No need for specialized investments in research and development, and we can also provide only a few products, even if the campaign does not raise the total requested could.
So no problem and concern for the failure to supply the drone ordered present among the perks, in any case will be produced and delivered. We are already producing and printing the first units that will soon be on-line;
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
A) WAL SYSTEM: In about ambitious project of R & D for the construction of a communication system that can allow the drone to move, both in water and on land and in the air, piloted remotely, we note that there are already several research institutes who are facing trial, us with the funds raised could develop independent research, or co-finance the one already in progress. The decision to make our R&A, or in affiliation with a research center, will depend on the extent of the amount raised. If this sum, as we have requested will be consistent, we could be the ones to develop the prototype and patenting;
B) SPACE TURISM: With regard instead to space tourism, it is clearly a dream, however, based on the amounts collected could decide to unite our efforts in the activities of other companies that are investing in the sector and contribute to the implementation of the consocenza technology. Whether the sums will be particularly strong we could develop activities and prototypes directly also saving patent.
I think part of the questions I have been asked this description are clearer, but I intend to further integrate the description, that also thanks to your comments we are completing the communication point of view.
in a short time we would insert also the first official products.

THE WAL SYSTEM
WAL system allows the drone to move in water, air, and earth, here the research and development and more challenging and only a crowdfunding campaign could finance it.
I take this opportunity, however, to provide the perk of flying models, or you move on hold, before arriving at the final version of a drone  with WAL System. 
For campaing  i created with the help of www.365startup.it (a new business incubator European and American by the American WIC VCTF INC - www.wicfund.com ), a TEAM of work for"" launch of the crowdfunding campaign,  that I hope will be helpful for my  project, than to that,  of other future crowdfunders.
so START to  ORDER your new STARWARS DRONE.
THE DREAMS

 


We start with a game, creating small drones, which are high-tech toys because they like performance drone professional.
Once created the imperial army of Starwars, we would do shows continuous swarming for the cinema, and would continue to produce models for our fans and fans of starwars.
Replicheremmo probably, with the success of the first campaign, also campaigns for other models of drones.
The purpose and scale of the game, to reality, with a first draft of research and development launched during the campaign to complete studies and research conducted at the university in order to create a real spaceship. This is clearly the research project, for its production then would assess whether to launch a special campaign or get other types of financial resources as both the nasa that other private companies (Elon Musk) are investing in space tourism, we could assist our resources to them.
Target a nice trip into space with all our CROWDFUNDER, and for those who do not believe, would send a thought from the moon when we land with our super 3° BLACK DEATH SHIP

 WIFE MISSING HAS NOT BEEN FILMED YET


What we have done so far: 
Since we are trying to raise the funds to make the full length feature film. We took some of the scenes from the full length script and created a teaser to use as a marketing tool. THE FILM HAS NOT BEEN MADE YET  

Human trafficking has become one of the largest money making business in the world and people seem to turn away from it, but everyone either has a child or knows someone with one and who knows they could be the next victim, yes boys as well as girls are kidnapped and enslaved as sex slaves. 

Wife Missing is guaranteed to keep you in suspense, while educating you about some very strong topics that need to be eradicated in the world.
Synopsis: After surviving a violently abusive husband, Brianna finally moves on along with her two children, she finalizes divorce proceedings, saves what is left of her home, and somehow repair their pieces of her shattered life.
However, her vengeful soon-to-be-ex-husband isn't done with her. With his
connections in organized crime, he arranges Brianna's abduction and
subsequently sells her into the sex trade underworld. 
In a story that spans
from the streets of New Jersey to the underbelly of the Chinese sex trade
industry, Brianna is once again, a prisoner. With friends on both sides of the
law looking for her, her two children desperately in need of her, and the
plight of her fellow sex trade prisoners now in her conscience, Brianna must
find the resolve to retain a fighting spirit. She must hold on to the idea that
she can go home again.

important it is to put women in leadership positions, here in Canada, we’ve
been doing it for more than 30 years!</span></p>
<p>In this documentary, you will be
introduced to 10 female ‘stars’ in the social finance field and I guarantee,
you’re going to like them. Charming, charismatic, intelligent, committed and of
course, visionaries. How could they not be? They got us all here.</p>
<p>In being part of this film
project, I’m asking you to join a movement, the ‘I freakin’ love social

good work! </p></span></h3>

</p>
<p>For this campaign,
we need $9,300. This is the 10% of the total budget needed to get the project
going. It will take 5 of us: Producer; Director; Sound;
Camera and Editor to get the story told and we’ll have to travel to 3 different
locations; Ottawa, Toronto and Vancouver because Canada is that big. To tell
the story of each of these amazing women, we’ll have site fees, insurance fees,
legal costs (mandatory), equipment rental and facility charges. <b>This is not a
home video! </b>Their stories and our’s deserve a top quality documentary and that
is why we are reaching out to you to help make it happen.</p>
<p><b>Perks! 
</b>We have great perks, the kind you hope for ~ access to the information
and social business expertise that these talented and inspiring women have. At the
top level, you can select One-on-One Coaching with the top woman in your field
or the one you most admire or the person who can take your company to the next
level. Yes, they can. They did it for themselves; they did it for all of us.</p>
<p>Also, at the $10 supporter level, why not
join the movement? Let’s publicize the good of social finance to everyone in
Canada. Spend $10 and announce to the world. ‘I freakin’ love social finance’.
Why not? Once you’re in it, you don’t ever want to go back to working only for
the paycheque, to focusing solely on profit, to ignoring the additional
benefits you could be giving to people except it’s not on the corporate agenda.</p>
<p>And of course, there will be the <u>film</u>!
You’ll be able to get a digital copy through a secure password portal. Also,
additional perks will include the full interviews of the women themselves;
uncut or Director’s cut, you’ll hear and see what each woman accomplished, how
long it took, what skills were needed, who helped (because she didn’t do it
alone and each woman will tell you that).</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>In the social finance field, we all talk impact. What impact will this
have? How much impact will be experienced? With this film, our long history and in
particular, these last 30 years, will show the world what Canada has been up
to. We’ve been changing lives, changing laws and changing business. We have broad
sector appeal if just more Canadians knew about us. It’s time for us to tell
our story. </p>

Hello, my name is Tina Crouse
and I’m the producer of the documentary SKIRTS! Canadian Women in Social
Finance. Canada has a long history in social finance, a long
cultural history but it’s over-shadowed by the US and the UK so no one knows
it. And funny enough, while all over the world, people are being told how
important it is to put women in leadership positions, here in Canada, we’ve
been doing it for more than 30 years!
In this documentary, you will be
introduced to 10 female ‘stars’ in the social finance field and I guarantee,
you’re going to like them. Charming, charismatic, intelligent, committed and of
course, visionaries. How could they not be? They got us all here.
In being part of this film
project, I’m asking you to join a movement, the ‘I freakin’ love social
finance’ movement. Why? Because this is how we change the world - we shift
priorities, we teach people how to marry profit and social benefits and we do
good work! 
   What We Need & What You Get 

For this campaign,
we need $9,300. This is the 10% of the total budget needed to get the project
going. It will take 5 of us: Producer; Director; Sound;
Camera and Editor to get the story told and we’ll have to travel to 3 different
locations; Ottawa, Toronto and Vancouver because Canada is that big. To tell
the story of each of these amazing women, we’ll have site fees, insurance fees,
legal costs (mandatory), equipment rental and facility charges. This is not a

We have great perks, the kind you hope for ~ access to the information

or the one you most admire or the person who can take your company to the next

The Impact 

In the social finance field, we all talk impact. What impact will this
have? How much impact will be experienced? With this film, our long history and in
particular, these last 30 years, will show the world what Canada has been up
to. We’ve been changing lives, changing laws and changing business. We have broad
sector appeal if just more Canadians knew about us. It’s time for us to tell
our story. 
Risks & Challenges
 As the producer, it’s my job to raise the money and coordinate the moving pieces. As I manage the film project, it frees the director to do her job which allows the camera and sound people to do their’s and finally, for the editor to polish it all so it’s worthy of release. If we don’t raise all of our funds through Indiegogo, we’ll keep going. The film is going to get made, perks will be honoured and one day, you’ll get to meet these 10 amazing women.

Everyone involved gets the gratification of completing a heartwarming film and the satisfaction of knowing that our hard work and dedication also helps to make the lives of other people better. But, here's a harsh but true reality: If we simply went out to ask for money to help people in need, the response just wouldn't be as great as what we know will happen when we offer incentives and the value of entertainment. So, we hope that you will honor our honest effort to meet our goals through this funding opportunity.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are risks involved in making any type of investment.

<p>When making an indie film, strangely it seems the bulk of the
budget goes towards necessities you don’t see on the screen in an obvious way
– accountants, lawyers, craft service – all very important things you can’t
make a film without. The first $5000 - $10000 we raise in this campaign will be
earmarked for those decidedly un-glamorous things. So, we truly hope we can
exceed far beyond that first hurdle so that we might afford more of what we
will be able to enjoy on screen. Admittedly, we set our crowdfunding goal very, very conservatively. $25000 really isn't enough to make this movie, but it's a good start. Hopefully with your help we'll be able to muster much, much more towards our stretch goals!

<h3>De verdad te digo...<br/>
</h3> <p>Cuando empecé con este sueño de hacer cine siempre pensé que sería guionista toda mi vida, pero el camino ha sido largo, con altos y bajos, y luego de varios años he aceptado el reto de dirigir esta película para que resulte tal y como la he imaginado. <br/></p>
<p>Esta campaña es importante porque está respaldada por una producción internacional. Si bien es mi ópera prima como directora, no es un proyecto dejado al azar y marcará un precedente de colaboración entre Guatemala, Perú y México con un equipo apasionado.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<h3><b>Sobre la historia<br/>
</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>Sinopsis</i></b></p>
<p>En una noche de luna, en una playa de pescadores, Toro
descubre que su Esposa lo engaña con un hombre más joven. En ese instante Toro
tiene que elegir entre la venganza o la resignación, o quizás ninguna de esas
dos opciones. <br/></p>
<p><b><i>Proceso de creación</i></b></p>
<p><i>El Toro y la luna</i> es un cortometraje de ficción de 12 minutos que combina el
estilo realista con momentos oníricos. La idea surgió hace cuatro años con la
imagen de una pintura sin firma en un bar de tapas que trajo consigo una vorágine
de ideas y de preguntas que crecieron hasta convertirse en una historia y,
sobre todo, en una manera especial de aproximarse a la historia. <br/></p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<h3><b>Necesitamos...<br/>
</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Tenemos
casi todo listo para esta nueva aventura: el guión, el storyboard, el equipo
técnico, creativo y artístico, su dedicación y voluntad, todas las capacidades
necesarias para hacer esta película, pero falta algo: el presupuesto. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Necesitamos por lo menos 10,500$ para que este proyecto se ponga en marcha. Tu ayuda nos permitirá
cubrir el costo del alquiler de los equipos, cámara, luces, sonido,  locaciones,
vestuario, los días de trabajo, los permisos y seguros, la comida para todos, el hospedaje y
transporte dentro de Guatemala, etc. Todo lo necesario para la
producción.<br/></p>
<p>Por eso hemos hecho este crowdfunding, porque sabemos que el cine
es un oficio laborioso y exigente y que es muy difícil vivir de amor y agua
fresca. 

</p>
Si no logramos la meta total seguiremos adelante con el proyecto pero tendremos que tratar de financiarlo durante todo el año o más, pues nuestro objetivo es hacer un cortometraje excelente.<br/> </div> <div>
<p>
</p>
<h3><b>¿Por qué Guatemala? <br/>
</b></h3>
<p>Es la primera pregunta que hacen muchos. </p>
<p>Este
es un proyecto complejo y completo, aquí trabajamos profesionales de distintos
orígenes con un interés común, gente de cine que se conoce y que se tiene
confianza absoluta, un ingrediente importantísimo porque en el cine es
fundamental trabajar con un equipo en el que se pueda confiar
ciegamente. El punto de encuentro es en Guatemala donde está la mayoría de
ellos. </p>
<p>Las locaciones tienen particularidades que han alimentado nuestra creatividad, las playas
de Guatemala tienen arena negra por su origen volcánico, las aguas son tranquilas
y las edificaciones resaltan en la imagen. Cada elemento agregará textura y
contraste. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>El
equipo está conformado por profesionales con experiencia, muchos de ellos han
trabajado en producciones que se han exhibido en grandes festivales.</p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Je te dis franchement ...<br/>
</h3> <p>Lorsque j'ai commencé à rêver à faire du cinéma, je pensais que je serais scénariste toute ma vie. Mais le chemin fût long - avec des hauts et des bas - et après quelques années, j'ai accepté le défi de réaliser ce film pour qu'il soit tel que je l'avais imaginé.</p>
<p>Cette campagne est importante parce qu'elle soutient une production internationale. Même si c'est ma première œuvre en tant que réalisatrice, ce n'est pas un projet laissé au hasard et il marquera un précédent dans la collaboration entre le Guatemala, le Pérou et le Mexique avec une équipe passionnée.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<h3><b>Au sujet de l'histoire<br/>
</b></h3>
<p><b><i>Synopsis</i></b></p>
<p>Dans un village de pêcheurs, une nuit de pleine lune, Toro découvre que sa femme le trompe avec un homme plus jeune. Il doit alors choisir entre la vengeance ou la résignation, ou peut-être aucune de ces deux options. Ce n'est pas une histoire d'amour, mais une histoire sur l'amour, sur la douleur de la trahison et sur la liberté.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><i>Processus de création</i></b></p>
<p><i>Le Toro et la lune</i> est un court métrage de fiction
de 12 minutes qui associe un style réaliste avec des moments oniriques. L'idée
est née il y a quatre ans avec l'image d'une peinture sans signature
dans un bar de tapas. Cette image a entraîné un tourbillon d'idées et de
questions qui ont mûri pour se transformer en une histoire et, par-dessus tout,
en une façon spéciale d'approcher l'histoire.</p>
<h3><b>Ce dont nous avons besoin<br/></b></h3>
<p>Presque tout est prêt pour cette nouvelle aventure: le scénario, le storyboard, l'équipe technique, créative et artistique, son dévouement et sa détermination, bref, toutes les compétences nécessaires pour faire ce film. La seule chose qui manque, c'est l'argent.</p>
<p>Nous devons couvrir les coûts de location du matériel technique (caméra, lumière, son), du logement, du transport et de la nourriture pour toute l'équipe à la plage où nous allons tourner, les lieux de tournage, les costumes, la rémunération des jours de travail, les permis et les assurances, etc. C'est pour cela que nous lançons ce financement participatif. Nous savons que le cinéma est un travail laborieux et exigeant et qu'il est bien difficile de vivre d'amour et d'eau fraîche…</p>
<p></p>
<h3>
</h3>
<h3><b>Pourquoi au Guatemala?</b></h3>
<p>C'est la question que beaucoup de gens se posent.</p>
<p>C'est un projet complexe et complet, sur lequel travaillent des 
professionnels d'origine diverses avec un intérêt commun. Ce sont des 
gens du cinéma qui se connaissent et qui ont une confiance absolue entre
 eux, un élément très important dans le milieu du cinéma. Le point de 
rencontre est au Guatemala puisque la majorité de ces gens y résident.</p>
<p>De
 plus, la particularité du lieu a alimenté notre créativité: la plage du
 Guatemala a un sable noir à cause de son origine volcanique. L'eau est 
tranquille, le décor se découpe dans l'image et chaque élément y gagne 
en texture et contraste.</p>
<p>L'équipe est formée de professionnels qui ont de l'expérience, dont la plupart ont travaillé sur des productions qui ont été montrées dans de grands festivals.</p>

<p> <span>When I started with the dream of making movies I always thought it would be writer all my life, but the road has been long, high and low, and after several years I have accepted the challenge of directing this film to make it as we have imagined it.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p> This campaign is important because it is supported by a 
international production. Although it is my first film as a director, it
 is not a project left to chance, and it will set a precedent of 
collaboration between Guatemala, Peru and Mexico with a passionate team.</p>

<h3><b>About the story</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Synopsis </b></p>
<p>One moonlit night in a fishing village, TORO (50), an
old fisherman, finds out that his WIFE(30) is having an affair with a younger
fisherman. Toro now has to choose between revenge or resignation. Or maybe he
doesn't choose any of those two options. It is not a love story but it is about
love, about the pain that comes with treason, and also about freedom.</p>
<p><b>Creation process </b><i><br/></i></p>
<p><i>The Toro and the moon</i>  is a
12 minutes short film fiction that combines a realistic style with dreamlike
instants. The idea arose four years ago with the image of a picture and has
growing into a story and above all, in a special way to approach the history. <br/></p>

<p><span>We need at least $ 10.500 for this project starts up. Your support will enable us to cover the cost of hiring equipment, camera, lights, sound, locations, costumes, days of work permits and insurance, food for everyone, lodging and transportation within Guatemala, etc. Everything needed for production.</span><br/></p>
<p><span>So we made this crowdfunding, because we know that cinema is a laborious and demanding job and it is very difficult to live only of love and fresh water.<br/> If we fail the total goal, we will go forward with the project but we will have try to fund it all year or more, because our goal is to make an excellent film.</span><br/></p>

De verdad te digo...
 Cuando empecé con este sueño de hacer cine siempre pensé que sería guionista toda mi vida, pero el camino ha sido largo, con altos y bajos, y luego de varios años he aceptado el reto de dirigir esta película para que resulte tal y como la he imaginado. 
Esta campaña es importante porque está respaldada por una producción internacional. Si bien es mi ópera prima como directora, no es un proyecto dejado al azar y marcará un precedente de colaboración entre Guatemala, Perú y México con un equipo apasionado.


 
Sobre la historia


Sinopsis
En una noche de luna, en una playa de pescadores, Toro
descubre que su Esposa lo engaña con un hombre más joven. En ese instante Toro
tiene que elegir entre la venganza o la resignación, o quizás ninguna de esas
dos opciones. 
Proceso de creación
El Toro y la luna es un cortometraje de ficción de 12 minutos que combina el
estilo realista con momentos oníricos. La idea surgió hace cuatro años con la
imagen de una pintura sin firma en un bar de tapas que trajo consigo una vorágine
de ideas y de preguntas que crecieron hasta convertirse en una historia y,
sobre todo, en una manera especial de aproximarse a la historia. 
 
Necesitamos...


Tenemos
casi todo listo para esta nueva aventura: el guión, el storyboard, el equipo
técnico, creativo y artístico, su dedicación y voluntad, todas las capacidades
necesarias para hacer esta película, pero falta algo: el presupuesto. 

Necesitamos por lo menos 10,500$ para que este proyecto se ponga en marcha. Tu ayuda nos permitirá
cubrir el costo del alquiler de los equipos, cámara, luces, sonido,  locaciones,
vestuario, los días de trabajo, los permisos y seguros, la comida para todos, el hospedaje y
transporte dentro de Guatemala, etc. Todo lo necesario para la
producción.
Por eso hemos hecho este crowdfunding, porque sabemos que el cine
es un oficio laborioso y exigente y que es muy difícil vivir de amor y agua
fresca. 


Si no logramos la meta total seguiremos adelante con el proyecto pero tendremos que tratar de financiarlo durante todo el año o más, pues nuestro objetivo es hacer un cortometraje excelente.  


¿Por qué Guatemala? 

Es la primera pregunta que hacen muchos. 
Este
es un proyecto complejo y completo, aquí trabajamos profesionales de distintos
orígenes con un interés común, gente de cine que se conoce y que se tiene
confianza absoluta, un ingrediente importantísimo porque en el cine es
fundamental trabajar con un equipo en el que se pueda confiar
ciegamente. El punto de encuentro es en Guatemala donde está la mayoría de
ellos. 
Las locaciones tienen particularidades que han alimentado nuestra creatividad, las playas
de Guatemala tienen arena negra por su origen volcánico, las aguas son tranquilas
y las edificaciones resaltan en la imagen. Cada elemento agregará textura y
contraste. 


El
equipo está conformado por profesionales con experiencia, muchos de ellos han
trabajado en producciones que se han exhibido en grandes festivales.
Algunos miembros del equipo



Marcela Cossíos, peruana. Soy la guionista y directora de este
cortometraje. Estudié guión de cine en Montreal y una maestría de guión de cine y TV en Madrid.

en un proyecto de largometraje para un director canadiense y me lanzo a dirigir

haremos juntos, esta será una co-producción entre Guatemala,  México y Perú.

 Français ...Ce n'est pas une histoire d'amour, mais une histoire sur l'amour, sur la douleur de la trahison et sur la liberté.

Je te dis franchement ...
 Lorsque j'ai commencé à rêver à faire du cinéma, je pensais que je serais scénariste toute ma vie. Mais le chemin fût long - avec des hauts et des bas - et après quelques années, j'ai accepté le défi de réaliser ce film pour qu'il soit tel que je l'avais imaginé.
Cette campagne est importante parce qu'elle soutient une production internationale. Même si c'est ma première œuvre en tant que réalisatrice, ce n'est pas un projet laissé au hasard et il marquera un précédent dans la collaboration entre le Guatemala, le Pérou et le Mexique avec une équipe passionnée.


 
Au sujet de l'histoire

Synopsis
Dans un village de pêcheurs, une nuit de pleine lune, Toro découvre que sa femme le trompe avec un homme plus jeune. Il doit alors choisir entre la vengeance ou la résignation, ou peut-être aucune de ces deux options. Ce n'est pas une histoire d'amour, mais une histoire sur l'amour, sur la douleur de la trahison et sur la liberté.


Processus de création
Le Toro et la lune est un court métrage de fiction
de 12 minutes qui associe un style réaliste avec des moments oniriques. L'idée
est née il y a quatre ans avec l'image d'une peinture sans signature
dans un bar de tapas. Cette image a entraîné un tourbillon d'idées et de
questions qui ont mûri pour se transformer en une histoire et, par-dessus tout,
en une façon spéciale d'approcher l'histoire.
Ce dont nous avons besoin
Presque tout est prêt pour cette nouvelle aventure: le scénario, le storyboard, l'équipe technique, créative et artistique, son dévouement et sa détermination, bref, toutes les compétences nécessaires pour faire ce film. La seule chose qui manque, c'est l'argent.
Nous devons couvrir les coûts de location du matériel technique (caméra, lumière, son), du logement, du transport et de la nourriture pour toute l'équipe à la plage où nous allons tourner, les lieux de tournage, les costumes, la rémunération des jours de travail, les permis et les assurances, etc. C'est pour cela que nous lançons ce financement participatif. Nous savons que le cinéma est un travail laborieux et exigeant et qu'il est bien difficile de vivre d'amour et d'eau fraîche…



Pourquoi au Guatemala?
C'est la question que beaucoup de gens se posent.
C'est un projet complexe et complet, sur lequel travaillent des 
professionnels d'origine diverses avec un intérêt commun. Ce sont des 
gens du cinéma qui se connaissent et qui ont une confiance absolue entre
 eux, un élément très important dans le milieu du cinéma. Le point de 
rencontre est au Guatemala puisque la majorité de ces gens y résident.
De
 plus, la particularité du lieu a alimenté notre créativité: la plage du
 Guatemala a un sable noir à cause de son origine volcanique. L'eau est 
tranquille, le décor se découpe dans l'image et chaque élément y gagne 
en texture et contraste.
L'équipe est formée de professionnels qui ont de l'expérience, dont la plupart ont travaillé sur des productions qui ont été montrées dans de grands festivals.
Quelques membres de l'équipe



Marcela Cossíos, péruvienne. Je suis la scénariste et réalisatrice de ce court métrage. J'ai étudié l'écriture de scénario à Montréal et à Madrid. J'ai écrit plusieurs courts métrages (Tic Tac, 2009. Le doute éphémère, 2009. Las flores del mal, 2012 - qui a gagné le concours national de courts métrages du ministère de la culture du Pérou et le prix du meilleur premier film au festival du cinéma de Lima Filmcorto. 
Récemment, j'ai collaboré à l'écriture d'un long métrage documentaire (Cristobal Halffter: Libertad Imaginada, Madrid 2014) et j'ai fait la coordination et la réécriture des scénarios de la série télé Somos family très appréciée des téléspectateurs de la chaîne Latina début 2015 au Pérou.
Je prépare actuellement une autre série télé, j'enseigne l'écriture de scénario, je travaille sur un projet de long métrage et je me lance dans la réalisation de mon premier court métrage.
Ma main droite sur ce projet, que j'ai connu à Madrid et qui m'a encouragé à me lancer dans cette aventure, est:



Fernando Cum, guatémaltèque. Directeur photo. C'est le directeur photo de ce court métrage. Il fait ses études de cinéma au Guatemala, au Mexique et en Espagne. Il a beaucoup d'expérience et de sensibilité avec les images. Il prépare actuellement son premier long métrage comme directeur de la photographie, Girkiq, comienza la aventura, le premier film de marionnettes d'Amérique centrale, un projet financé grâce à une campagne de crowdfunding.
Fernando souhaite démontrer que l'on peut faire du cinéma de qualité au Guatemala et nous le ferons ensemble. Ce sera une coproduction entre le Guatemala, le Mexique et le Pérou.



Joanna Prado, plus connue sous le nom de Jou. Mexicaine. Directrice artistique, scénographe et artiste plastique. Elle a travaillé sur plusieurs productions en Espagne, au Mexique et au Guatemala. Elle travaille régulièrement avec Fernando, un bon point puisqu'ils connaissent bien leur façon de travailler. Elle prépare actuellement son deuxième long métrage comme directrice, Girqik, comienza la aventura. Polyvalente, elle est très adroite pour créer des choses à partir de rien.



Andrés Rodríguez, guatémaltèque. Réalisateur audiovisuel. C'est l'assistant réalisateur de ce court métrage. Il a beaucoup d'expérience en cinéma et télévision dans les domaines de la réalisation, de l'assistanat de réalisation, de la production, du casting, etc.
Comme réalisateur, il a réalisé divers courts métrages qui ont été sélectionnés dans des festivals internationaux (Lorena, 2014. Armadillo-Helvetas (2013). Ulew (2013). Para los 30 (2012), etc.) Andrés a également participé à divers longs métrages comme assistant de direction, directeur de casting, direction de production. Plusieurs d'entre eux ont été montrés dans des festivals internationaux réputés: 1991 (2014); La casa más grande del mundo (2014); La Jaula de oro (2013).



Lucho Cáceres, acteur péruvien. C'est lui qui interprète le rôle principal de ce court métrage. Il a travaillé sur beaucoup de longs métrages à succès (Cielo oscuro 2012. El evangelio de la carne 2013. El elefante desaparecido 2014, etc.) et à des dizaines de pièces de théâtre et de séries de télévision. Lucho a un registre de jeu impressionnant pour caractériser ses personnages: intense, expressif ou modéré, c'est un acteur polyvalent.
Comment nous aider...  
Tout est presque prêt pour faire ce film. Nous espérons que tu as aimé ce que tu as découvert ici et que tu pourras faire partie de ce projet.
Tu peux aussi parler de notre financement sur les réseaux sociaux ou à tes amis fans de cinéma et des défis.  Aide-nous à rendre cette campagne de financement virale pour que beaucoup de monde puisse la connaître.
Merci beaucoup!
L'équipe de LE TORO ET LA LUNE

 English ...I want really tell you... 
 When I started with the dream of making movies I always thought it would be writer all my life, but the road has been long, high and low, and after several years I have accepted the challenge of directing this film to make it as we have imagined it.

 This campaign is important because it is supported by a 
international production. Although it is my first film as a director, it
 is not a project left to chance, and it will set a precedent of 
collaboration between Guatemala, Peru and Mexico with a passionate team.

 
About the story

Synopsis 
One moonlit night in a fishing village, TORO (50), an
old fisherman, finds out that his WIFE(30) is having an affair with a younger
fisherman. Toro now has to choose between revenge or resignation. Or maybe he
doesn't choose any of those two options. It is not a love story but it is about
love, about the pain that comes with treason, and also about freedom.
Creation process 
The Toro and the moon  is a
12 minutes short film fiction that combines a realistic style with dreamlike
instants. The idea arose four years ago with the image of a picture and has
growing into a story and above all, in a special way to approach the history. 



We need... 



We have almost everything ready for this new adventure: the script, storyboard, technical, creative and artistic team, dedication and determination, all necessary skills to make this movie, but something is missing: the budget.
We need at least $ 10.500 for this project starts up. Your support will enable us to cover the cost of hiring equipment, camera, lights, sound, locations, costumes, days of work permits and insurance, food for everyone, lodging and transportation within Guatemala, etc. Everything needed for production.
So we made this crowdfunding, because we know that cinema is a laborious and demanding job and it is very difficult to live only of love and fresh water. If we fail the total goal, we will go forward with the project but we will have try to fund it all year or more, because our goal is to make an excellent film.


Why Guatemala? 
It is the first question I get asked by many. 


This is a complex and complete project. Here, we work professionals from different origins with a common interest, cinema people who know each other and have absolute trust on the teem, an important ingredient because cinema is essential to work with a team where he can trust blindly. The meeting point is in Guatemala where most of them are.The team is made by professionals with experience, many of whom have worked in productions exhibited at important festivals.

<h3><b>Qui sommes-nous ?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Étudiants en Licence Cinéma à l’université Paris
Ouest Nanterre, nous faisons partie de l’atelier Ciné-Ouest, coordonné depuis la rentrée 2010 par Carole Milleliri. L'atelier a pour but d’initier les étudiants à la création d'événements
culturels.</p>
<p>Au programme
: découverte des métiers de la distribution, de l'exploitation et de la
programmation, apprentissage du travail en équipe, négociation avec
les distributeurs, discussion avec les partenaires exploitants, création
de supports de communication, organisation d'un plan médias, animation
de séances de cinéma...</p>
<p>Au fil des années, cet atelier pratique a donné naissance à de multiples
événements, jusqu'à la création du festival Ciné-Rebelle l'an passé, en mars
2014.</p>
<p>

<p><b>Samedi 11 avril 2015 – 20h30 à l'aube – Cinéma Les Lumières</b></p>
<p>Cette année, la Nuit Ciné-Rebelle présentera quatre films pétris
par un souffle de révolte et/ou d’innovation à leur sortie, des films rebelles
dans leur façon de représenter et d'interroger la société qui les a vus naître.
Il s’agira de mettre en avant un cinéma frondeur, qui bouleverse l'horizon
d'attente du spectateur. Ce sera donc l’occasion de redécouvrir quatre films à
la carrière internationale. Des films qui restent gravés dans les mémoires et
qui méritent de retrouver les honneurs du grand écran pour être appréciés dans
toute leur fougue.</p>

trouver sa place jusqu’aux salles dans un paysage cinématographique saturé. Par

débattre ensemble d’enjeux actuels. <br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1235332/files/20150220032743-espace-reverdy.jpg?1424431663"" src="""" style=""width: 511.573px; height: 382px;""/></p>
<p><b>1 - Liberté et sexualité à l’écran : le queer en question</b></p><p>Aujourd’hui, la notion de liberté sexuelle renvoie beaucoup dans notre imaginaire à la notion de queer et aux mouvements LGBT. La revendication des libertés sexuelles, visant à leur légitimité sociale et culturelle a-t-elle libéré les représentations cinématographiques ou conduit à la création de nouveaux stéréotypes ? L’institutionnalisation des mouvements LGBT a-t-elle contribué à marginaliser ou à populariser le cinéma queer ?<b><br/></b></p><b>
</b><p><b>2 - Quand les femmes se regardent : les représentations du
féminin au féminin</b></p>
<p>Autrefois purement objet cinématographique, les femmes, par leur présence dans les métiers du cinéma, ont-elles réussi à reprendre en main leur propre image filmique ? En compagnie de femmes et d’hommes travaillant dans différents domaines du cinéma (production, réalisation, programmation, jeu), nous nous interrogerons sur la force des conditionnements sociaux et sur les barrières que nous nous imposons à nous-mêmes.</p><br/>
<p><b>== SOIRÉE COURTS METRAGES ==<br/></b></p>
<p><b>Vendredi 17 avril – 20h30 – Cinéma Chaplin Denfert</b></p>
<p>Notre appel à films a permis de collecter près de 130 films. Le 17
avril, nous proposerons donc une dizaine de films courts sur grand écran pour
explorer la fantaisie, la folie, la liberté de ce format élastique et de ce champ
de création hétéroclite. </p>

<p><b>Weekend du 18-19 avril – Cinéma Le Lincoln</b></p>
<p>Mettre en avant <span>de
jeunes réalisateurs en marge du système et des méthodes académiques, insufflant un vent nouveau sur le cinéma
français. Voilà l’envie qui guide notre programmation, pour sortir du champ encore trop imposant dans les
sorties hebdomadaires d’un cinéma aux
formes classiques, qui n’a plus rien
à dire ou à montrer, qu’il soit français ou étranger. Marre de voir les mêmes histoires, la même
esthétique, la même façon de cadrer ? Un
autre cinéma est possible et il trouve sa place timidement dans les salles
françaises. Dans ce cinéma-là, les réalisateurs ont moins de
moyens, mais plus d’idées. Autodidactes, sortis d’écoles de cinéma ou issus
du monde du théâtre, bien de jeunes cinéastes viennent aujourd’hui constituer
une nouvelle « Nouvelle Vague », pleine de folie créative et
d’impertinence.</span>

<h3>Ce dont nous avons besoin...</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Pour cette deuxième édition, les copies des longs-métrages sont financées
par nos partenaires exploitants (Cinéma Les Lumières et Cinémas Chaplin) et une
petite enveloppe nous est fournie par le département Arts du spectacle. La
communication print est financée par le service d’Action culturelle de
l'université Paris Ouest Nanterre La Défense, en complément d'une communication
web déjà en cours de déploiement sur le site de l'université ainsi que sur les
réseaux sociaux (plus de 600 fans sur Facebook).</p>
<p>Nous vous invitons d'ailleurs à consulter notre page :</p>
<p><b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/festivalcinerebelle"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/festivalcinerebelle</a></b></p>
<p>La création d'un festival implique d’autres frais liés à
l'édition de certains supports de diffusion et à la dimension événementielle du
projet. La somme de 2000 euros que nous souhaitons rassembler doit donc nous
permettre : </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>De créer un master de projection numérique (format DCP, normes
professionnelles) avec l’ensemble des courts-métrages pour la soirée du vendredi
17 avril. C'est-à-dire de défrayer un monteur pour sa réalisation et financer
le support en lui-même.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>De soutenir la communication print par l'impression de photographies et
articles de presse, exposés à l'université et dans nos salles partenaires.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>D’accueillir les intervenants professionnels dans de bonnes conditions </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>De financer les différents buffets prévus pendant le festival (en particulier
pendant la nuit cinéma)</p>
<p>·<span>

<h3>Pourquoi nous aider ?</h3>
<p>En contribuant au budget du Festival Ciné-Rebelle, vous aidez un projet jeune porté par un groupe de 27 étudiants passionnés et engagés. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Soutenir Ciné-Rebelle, c'est s'engager pour un projet jeune mais sérieux,</b> qui défend un regard pluriel sur le cinéma et invite à la rencontre. Dans la forêt des événements cinéma, le festival Ciné-Rebelle trouve sa singularité non seulement dans la diversité de son programme (avec une identité à la fois universitaire et ludique), mais également dans la configuration de ses équipes. Chaque année : une nouvelle promotion d'étudiants, programmateurs débutants, un nouveau départ, de nouveaux défis... <br/>
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<b>Soutenir Ciné-Rebelle, c'est permettre à des étudiants en cinéma de parfaire un projet  important dans leur professionnalisation</b>. Ce projet leur permet de découvrir des métiers cachés du cinéma, mais aussi de se confronter aux enjeux et aux contraintes de la création d'un événement complexe : apprendre à collaborer avec des professionnels du secteur, gérer au mieux un budget, travailler en équipe, respecter des délais, organiser un plan de communication. Autant de compétences utiles pour leur avenir (et transférables dans bien des domaines).<br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risques et défis</h3>Le principal défi pour nous est de vous amener jusqu'à la salle de cinéma !<br/>Nous savons bien à quel point l'offre culturelle est chargée à Paris et en Ile-de-France. Mais nous espérons trouver notre place dans vos cœurs et vous dans nos salles. Pour cela, nous avons prévu un plan de communication structuré, dont cette campagne Indiegogo constitue une phase cruciale.<br/><br/>Après une première édition prototype, l'enseignante coordinatrice et ses
 étudiants programmateurs ont tiré profit de cette expérience pour 
proposer une deuxième édition plus riche, plus ambitieuse, à l'organisation professionnelle.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>D'autres façons de nous aider</h3>
<p></p>
</div><p>Si le projet du festival Ciné-Rebelle vous intéresse, mais que vous ne pouvez pas y contribuer financièrement, il existe d'autres façons de nous aider.</p><ul>
<li>D'abord, en relayant cette page Indiegogo autour de vous. Tout simplement ! Vous aimez notre projet, invitez vos amis à y participer. Ce sera déjà beaucoup pour nous.</li>
<li>Ensuite, vous pouvez soutenir notre communication sur l'événement en lui-même via les réseaux sociaux. Faites du bruit pour Ciné-Rebelle !</li>
<li>Et, évidemment, venez nombreux du 10 au 19 avril à nos projections et rencontres !! On a hâte de vous voir en personne.</li>

décidé de faire corps avec l’idée d’un cinéma émancipé et libre. Une programmation plurielle,
étonnante et détonante. Des regards jeunes sur le cinéma et
le monde. Nous vous proposons de découvrir des films passés
furtivement sur les écrans, mais dont la qualité est indiscutable, de découvrir de grands succès sous un éclairage nouveau, mais aussi d'en discuter
ensemble et d’échanger avec des professionnels autour de leur travail.
Nous vous convions donc à partager cette expérience cinéphile, ouverte aux
cinéphages, aux passionnés, comme aux grand curieux !”
 - Les programmateurs de Ciné-Rebelle 2015Un événement créé en partenariat avec le Cinéma Les Lumières
(Nanterre), les Cinémas Chaplin (Paris), le Cinéma Le Lincoln (Paris), l'ACID (Association du Cinéma Indépendant pour sa Diffusion), Clap Mag et Universciné. Avec
le soutien du département Arts du spectacle et du service d'Action culturelle de l'Université Paris Ouest.

Qui sommes-nous ?


Étudiants en Licence Cinéma à l’université Paris
Ouest Nanterre, nous faisons partie de l’atelier Ciné-Ouest, coordonné depuis la rentrée 2010 par Carole Milleliri. L'atelier a pour but d’initier les étudiants à la création d'événements
culturels.
Au programme
: découverte des métiers de la distribution, de l'exploitation et de la
programmation, apprentissage du travail en équipe, négociation avec
les distributeurs, discussion avec les partenaires exploitants, création
de supports de communication, organisation d'un plan médias, animation
de séances de cinéma...
Au fil des années, cet atelier pratique a donné naissance à de multiples
événements, jusqu'à la création du festival Ciné-Rebelle l'an passé, en mars
2014.


Que préparons-nous cette année ?
== SÉANCE D'OUVERTURE ==
Vendredi 10 avril 2015 – 20h30 – Cinéma Les Lumières

Ouverture du festival avec une séance spéciale, en
partenariat avec l'ACID :Le Challat de Tunis de Kaouther Ben Hania (Tunisie, France, Canada, Émirats Arabes Unis -
1h30 min - Sortie France : avril 2015).Tunisie, avant la révolution. Un homme à moto, armé d’un rasoir, balafre
 les fesses des femmes qui arpentent les trottoirs de Tunis. On 
l’appelle le Challat, “la lame”. Fait divers, rumeur ou mise en scène politique, d’un quartier à l’autre,
 tout le monde en parle, mais personne ne l’a jamais vu. Dix ans plus 
tard, alors qu’avec le Printemps Arabe les langues se délient, une jeune
 réalisatrice obstinée enquête pour élucider le mystère du Challat de 
Tunis.

 Projection suivie d'une rencontre avec l'équipe du film.
== NUIT CINÉMA ==
Samedi 11 avril 2015 – 20h30 à l'aube – Cinéma Les Lumières
Cette année, la Nuit Ciné-Rebelle présentera quatre films pétris
par un souffle de révolte et/ou d’innovation à leur sortie, des films rebelles
dans leur façon de représenter et d'interroger la société qui les a vus naître.
Il s’agira de mettre en avant un cinéma frondeur, qui bouleverse l'horizon
d'attente du spectateur. Ce sera donc l’occasion de redécouvrir quatre films à
la carrière internationale. Des films qui restent gravés dans les mémoires et
qui méritent de retrouver les honneurs du grand écran pour être appréciés dans
toute leur fougue.
Henry, portrait d'un serial killer de John Mc Naughton. Durée : 1h23.Orange mécanique de Stanley Kubrick. Durée : 2h16.Persepolis de Marjane Sartrapi et Vincent Paronnaud. Durée : 1h35La Haine de Mathieu Kassovitz. Durée  : 1h35La nuit sera ponctuée d’animations entre les séances : concert acoustique, quizz avec lots à gagner, buffet...== TABLES RONDES ==
Mardi 14 & Mercredi 15 avril 2015 – 18h - Espace Reverdy - Bat. L - Université Paris Ouest
Deux tables rondes pour promouvoir et défendre un cinéma pluriel,
reflet de la diversité d’un monde en mutation, ce cinéma qui a parfois du mal à
trouver sa place jusqu’aux salles dans un paysage cinématographique saturé. Par
ces tables rondes, nous souhaitons créer un lieu chaleureux d'échanges
privilégiés entre étudiants, professionnels du cinéma et amateurs curieux pour
débattre ensemble d’enjeux actuels. 
1 - Liberté et sexualité à l’écran : le queer en questionAujourd’hui, la notion de liberté sexuelle renvoie beaucoup dans notre imaginaire à la notion de queer et aux mouvements LGBT. La revendication des libertés sexuelles, visant à leur légitimité sociale et culturelle a-t-elle libéré les représentations cinématographiques ou conduit à la création de nouveaux stéréotypes ? L’institutionnalisation des mouvements LGBT a-t-elle contribué à marginaliser ou à populariser le cinéma queer ?
2 - Quand les femmes se regardent : les représentations du
féminin au féminin
Autrefois purement objet cinématographique, les femmes, par leur présence dans les métiers du cinéma, ont-elles réussi à reprendre en main leur propre image filmique ? En compagnie de femmes et d’hommes travaillant dans différents domaines du cinéma (production, réalisation, programmation, jeu), nous nous interrogerons sur la force des conditionnements sociaux et sur les barrières que nous nous imposons à nous-mêmes.
== SOIRÉE COURTS METRAGES ==
Vendredi 17 avril – 20h30 – Cinéma Chaplin Denfert
Notre appel à films a permis de collecter près de 130 films. Le 17
avril, nous proposerons donc une dizaine de films courts sur grand écran pour
explorer la fantaisie, la folie, la liberté de ce format élastique et de ce champ
de création hétéroclite. 


== PROJECTIONS-DÉBATS ==
Weekend du 18-19 avril – Cinéma Le Lincoln
Mettre en avant de
jeunes réalisateurs en marge du système et des méthodes académiques, insufflant un vent nouveau sur le cinéma
français. Voilà l’envie qui guide notre programmation, pour sortir du champ encore trop imposant dans les
sorties hebdomadaires d’un cinéma aux
formes classiques, qui n’a plus rien
à dire ou à montrer, qu’il soit français ou étranger. Marre de voir les mêmes histoires, la même
esthétique, la même façon de cadrer ? Un
autre cinéma est possible et il trouve sa place timidement dans les salles
françaises. Dans ce cinéma-là, les réalisateurs ont moins de
moyens, mais plus d’idées. Autodidactes, sortis d’écoles de cinéma ou issus
du monde du théâtre, bien de jeunes cinéastes viennent aujourd’hui constituer
une nouvelle « Nouvelle Vague », pleine de folie créative et
d’impertinence.

Samedi  18 avril 19h : Tonnerre de Guillaume BracEn présence de Vincent Macaigne et Guillaume Brac.21h30 : Les Rencontres d'après-minuit de Yann GonzalezEn présence de Yann Gonzalez.Dimanche 19 avril 19h : La Bataille de Solférino de Justine TrietEn présence du producteur du film : Emmanuel Chaumet.21h30 : Une avant-première surprise

Ce dont nous avons besoin...

Pour cette deuxième édition, les copies des longs-métrages sont financées
par nos partenaires exploitants (Cinéma Les Lumières et Cinémas Chaplin) et une
petite enveloppe nous est fournie par le département Arts du spectacle. La
communication print est financée par le service d’Action culturelle de
l'université Paris Ouest Nanterre La Défense, en complément d'une communication
web déjà en cours de déploiement sur le site de l'université ainsi que sur les
réseaux sociaux (plus de 600 fans sur Facebook).
Nous vous invitons d'ailleurs à consulter notre page :
https://www.facebook.com/festivalcinerebelle
La création d'un festival implique d’autres frais liés à
l'édition de certains supports de diffusion et à la dimension événementielle du
projet. La somme de 2000 euros que nous souhaitons rassembler doit donc nous
permettre : 
· 
De créer un master de projection numérique (format DCP, normes
professionnelles) avec l’ensemble des courts-métrages pour la soirée du vendredi
17 avril. C'est-à-dire de défrayer un monteur pour sa réalisation et financer
le support en lui-même.
· 
De soutenir la communication print par l'impression de photographies et
articles de presse, exposés à l'université et dans nos salles partenaires.
· 
D’accueillir les intervenants professionnels dans de bonnes conditions 
· 
De financer les différents buffets prévus pendant le festival (en particulier
pendant la nuit cinéma)
· 
De créer des goodies Ciné-Rebelle



Pourquoi nous aider ?
En contribuant au budget du Festival Ciné-Rebelle, vous aidez un projet jeune porté par un groupe de 27 étudiants passionnés et engagés. 


Soutenir Ciné-Rebelle, c'est s'engager pour un projet jeune mais sérieux, qui défend un regard pluriel sur le cinéma et invite à la rencontre. Dans la forêt des événements cinéma, le festival Ciné-Rebelle trouve sa singularité non seulement dans la diversité de son programme (avec une identité à la fois universitaire et ludique), mais également dans la configuration de ses équipes. Chaque année : une nouvelle promotion d'étudiants, programmateurs débutants, un nouveau départ, de nouveaux défis... 



Soutenir Ciné-Rebelle, c'est permettre à des étudiants en cinéma de parfaire un projet  important dans leur professionnalisation. Ce projet leur permet de découvrir des métiers cachés du cinéma, mais aussi de se confronter aux enjeux et aux contraintes de la création d'un événement complexe : apprendre à collaborer avec des professionnels du secteur, gérer au mieux un budget, travailler en équipe, respecter des délais, organiser un plan de communication. Autant de compétences utiles pour leur avenir (et transférables dans bien des domaines).



Risques et défisLe principal défi pour nous est de vous amener jusqu'à la salle de cinéma !Nous savons bien à quel point l'offre culturelle est chargée à Paris et en Ile-de-France. Mais nous espérons trouver notre place dans vos cœurs et vous dans nos salles. Pour cela, nous avons prévu un plan de communication structuré, dont cette campagne Indiegogo constitue une phase cruciale.Après une première édition prototype, l'enseignante coordinatrice et ses
 étudiants programmateurs ont tiré profit de cette expérience pour 
proposer une deuxième édition plus riche, plus ambitieuse, à l'organisation professionnelle.

D'autres façons de nous aider

Si le projet du festival Ciné-Rebelle vous intéresse, mais que vous ne pouvez pas y contribuer financièrement, il existe d'autres façons de nous aider.
D'abord, en relayant cette page Indiegogo autour de vous. Tout simplement ! Vous aimez notre projet, invitez vos amis à y participer. Ce sera déjà beaucoup pour nous.
Ensuite, vous pouvez soutenir notre communication sur l'événement en lui-même via les réseaux sociaux. Faites du bruit pour Ciné-Rebelle !
Et, évidemment, venez nombreux du 10 au 19 avril à nos projections et rencontres !! On a hâte de vous voir en personne.

It performed admirably in the Johannesburg, South Africa competition of the 48HFP where it was nominated for nine award categories including Best Directing, Best Editing, Best Script and WINNING Best Dialogue, Best Acting and the coveted BEST FILM.
The TEAM (Iconic) behind Death's (Man)date consists of eleven independent Johannesburg based filmmakers with different levels of experience and skill but all passionate about film as a medium; all looking to find ways to improve themselves as technical and creative individuals.
Winning the Johannesburg leg of the competition means Death's (Man)date gets to participate in the international competition, and is invited to attend the FILMAPALOOZA event in Hollywood where 48HFP teams from around the world gather to share stories, partake in panel discussions, network with one another and support their film, city and country at the award ceremony where the top 10 films will be announced and sent to the CANNES INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL.
Being able to attend the event in Hollywood personally offers South African independent filmmakers a rare opportunity to interact with other filmmakers from around the world.

   What We Need We need money to get the cast and crew to Hollywood. 
The South African Rand (ZAR) is very weak against the United States' Dollar which means travelling to the US is incredibly expensive for South Africans. More so for independent filmmakers most of whom work as industry freelancers.

If we are unable to gather the full amount, anything we could gather will go to flights and seeing if we can at least get some of the members to LA to experience what could be a game changer for these guys.

    The Impact The South African film industry is going through a time of growth, allowing young independent filmmakers a platform to showcase and further their careers. Opportunities are however hard fought to get and recognition and funding is still pretty scarce. Attending an event where these filmmakers can increase their exposure to the greater film industry but also share themselves and their work with more people is a great opportunity to create relationships and opportunities for themselves while also making friends and building relationships that can turn into future collaborations.

A
CELEBRATION OF EMPOWERED WOMEN, ACTION FILMS, & WOMEN WHO KICK ASS IN THEM.·

women we hope to help blow the doors off personal notions of limitation for
women everywhere.
For every dollar we raise here, we are donating 4% to Girls on the

</div></span></h3> <p>""Being a kid who grew up in the late 70s and into the 80s, I cut my teeth on shows like <i>Buck Rogers, Battlestar Galactica, He-Man, the Lone Ranger, Star Wars, and the Original Star Trek.</i></p>
<p> MAX ADVENTURE is the combination of <i>great family entertainment</i> with <i>educational properties</i> for the young and teen crowd. Everything that I loved as a kid is what makes MAX what it is. With more and <i>more kids </i>being turned to <i>violent video games</i>, MAX ADVENTURE is the <i>right mix of adventure, fun, and education.</i></p>
<p>How cool is it to watch something that's <i>fun</i> and <i>entertaining</i> that has a <i>moral twist</i> to it? <i>Kids won't even know they're being educated</i>!""   </p>

<p>All projects face risks, challenges and setbacks. We are lucky in the fact that we have the people lined up, the business legalized and formulated and support from our sponsors and fans. </p>
<p>Our BIGGEST challenge right now is simply getting the funds to kick this project off. While we've listed $80,000 as our asking price, this amount only allows for the <i>bare minimum</i> needed to see season 1 of MAX ADVENTURE completed. We would all have to keep our day jobs which could very well hold up production and distribution submission.</p>
<p>Speaking of distribution, while Page Ostrow is great at what she does (and can usually land a deal within 3 months,) there's no promise that Max will find distribution immediately. In fact, if <i>and when  </i>it <i>does, </i>the network may very well ask for changes which could also set us back.</p>
<p>There are other unforeseen situations such as computers could fail, renders could crash, actors could lose their voices or face personal crisis, e.t.c.  </p>
<p>In any case, with your support you <b>WILL</b> see <b>MAX ADVENTURE completed</b>! </p>

 ""Being a kid who grew up in the late 70s and into the 80s, I cut my teeth on shows like Buck Rogers, Battlestar Galactica, He-Man, the Lone Ranger, Star Wars, and the Original Star Trek.
 MAX ADVENTURE is the combination of great family entertainment with educational properties for the young and teen crowd. Everything that I loved as a kid is what makes MAX what it is. With more and more kids being turned to violent video games, MAX ADVENTURE is the right mix of adventure, fun, and education.
How cool is it to watch something that's fun and entertaining that has a moral twist to it? Kids won't even know they're being educated!""   
Phillip ""Pat"" Fitzlaff Owner Motion Dynamics Animation, LLC





When an overly glorified delivery man (Max) is thrust through a black hole, his ship crash lands on the strange planet of Nemisia. He quickly finds himself caught in a war between the Nemisian Army and the Goranian Resistance, and the subject of interest by both!

These days, in order to find, negotiate track and collect on deals for independent filmmakers and producers Ostrow relies on her extensive relationships and the previous distribution expertise developed during the ten years she spent providing distributors with global sales support, licensing and pre-sales for their film projects and libraries to international buyers at all the film markets. As a result Page Ostrow maintains her contacts with key executives who have a shared vision toward launching quality films into the marketplace."" (Source: Ostrow and Company)

Curtis Fowler, B.F.A - ActorThe acting bug hit Curtis back in high school, and ever since then if he is not involved in any productions, he's making up his own in front of the mirror. Getting his start doing live theater through the Las Vegas Little Theatre in such productions as""Beau Jest"", he slowly moved up, receiving roles as a Starfleet Officer at the live action Star Trek The Experience at the Las Vegas Hilton, to having a supporting role in an international Nissan commercial. Soon after his interest in post production work grew as well, attending the Art Institute of Las Vegas studying Digital Media Production, learning about camerawork and editing. Curtis is lending his talents as the adorable yet absent minded robot, Tugg-Butt.

AMAHL DUNBAR - ANIMATOR Another Star Trek: The Experience alumni to join the MAX ADVENTURE family is Amahl Dunbar. Amahl is not only an accomplished animator, but has taught computer animation at the College of Southern Nevada. He has just recently wrapped an independent feature called Space Detectives as the lead animator and effects person on the project.  Some of his work can be viewed here. 


Brandon Anderson, B.S Computer Science - Character AnimatorBrandon is a multitalented powerhouse. His demo reel, education and raw talent allows for the perfect blend of artistry that will allow our characters to not only breath life, but show character.  



ERIC BUMPUS, M.B.A - EDITOR

Eric has a vast background in media production, audio and photography. In addition to holding an MBA, he has experience in organizing both pre and post production aspects of a production and is owner of his own production company, Meliora Productions.    


Jennifer Kansky, M.ed - Educational Consultant
Jennifer is definitely one of the joys of the production. Not only is she a mother of three, but she is also an educator who holds dual master degrees in Education and Law. She is responsible for ensuring each MAX ADVENTURE story meets educational guidelines.
Gerson R. Druckman, CPA
Mr. Druckman is one of the few ""honest Abes"" out there and we are proud to have him represent our financial interests. Those who donate to MAX ADVENTURE can rest assured that the bookkeeping and IRS representation will be in order through his company's services.  



Our mission is to create quality adventure based educational shows. With a talent pool who work in entertainment, education and psychology, we bring over 80 years combined experience to the table!
Our biggest concern moving forward is guaranteeing that YOU have access to the film. This is very important to us because we are asking you to put your faith in our team to bring this story to you. Provided that our goal is met, we pledge to bring MAX ADVENTURE directly to YOU via a digital download for those contributing $30 or over.

All projects face risks, challenges and setbacks. We are lucky in the fact that we have the people lined up, the business legalized and formulated and support from our sponsors and fans. 
Our BIGGEST challenge right now is simply getting the funds to kick this project off. While we've listed $80,000 as our asking price, this amount only allows for the bare minimum needed to see season 1 of MAX ADVENTURE completed. We would all have to keep our day jobs which could very well hold up production and distribution submission.
Speaking of distribution, while Page Ostrow is great at what she does (and can usually land a deal within 3 months,) there's no promise that Max will find distribution immediately. In fact, if and when  it does, the network may very well ask for changes which could also set us back.
There are other unforeseen situations such as computers could fail, renders could crash, actors could lose their voices or face personal crisis, e.t.c.  
In any case, with your support you WILL see MAX ADVENTURE completed! 




We're happy you asked! To be blunt, your contributions will go into a business account registered under Motion Dynamics, LLC. Your donations will go towards equipment, updated software, distribution costs, legal costs, marketing and pr, and a stipend to the cast and crew. 
Of course, the more you give, the more we can do!
What does this mean? More quality assurance over the project so that we can operate more efficiently and more quickly which will streamline the production. This will allow us to get our product to the distributor faster while offering a better product overall. 
Here's the Breakdown:
Materials: 35%
Payroll:  30%
Overhead: 20%
Contingencies: 10%
Taxes: 5%

<p><b>Jamie Hall</b>: Jessie James Hall has always had a passion for all 
the arts, music, 
painting, sculptures, and above all cinema and film. As a child of only 
10 years of age he was placed behind the camera for the first time when 
his grandfather, George Hall, purchased a V/H/S home video camera. 
Jessie found himself directing his action figures in various short 
films. Mr. Hall’s grandfather also influenced his artistic eye by 
introducing him to such horror greats as Alfred Hitchcock, Rod Sterling,
 and Vincent Price. As Jessie grew older he discovered many more 
directors such as Stanley Kubrick, The Cohen brothers, Martin Scorsese, 
David and Jennifer Lynch who influenced his style even more.<br/></p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In his early 20’s Jessie did abandon film for a brief period to per sue
 his love for playing East Coast Hardcore and Punk style music.He was approached by the Bravo Channel to film pilot for a reality 
television show in titled “The List”. He has worked with other networks 
such as VH1 as Director of Photography for the Kita Williams reality 
show. It was there that he meet his soon to be best friend and business 
partner, J. Lazarus Hawk. The team of Hall and Hawk decided to join 
forces and operate the company Rising Fyre Productions.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawk better known as Laz in the Memphis film community was 
interested in a script that Jessie co-wrote and planned to direct titled
 “ Cold Blooded”. Filming for ""Cold Blooded"" commenced on January 19, 2012 
and wrapped March 5, 2012. Cold Blooded was the first film Jessie ever 
premiered to the public. Met with rave reviews and heartfelt criticism, 
his first official short film inspired him to get started on his first 
feature length film. </p>

<p>In July, 1997, after spending a decade in Connecticut, Lazarus moved to 
Memphis, Tennessee, where he met film director Craig Brewer, who gave 
him his first opportunity to work in film. He played a drug dealer in 
Craig’s film “The Poor and Hungry.</p>

<p>Two years later, Craig served as Executive Producer on Lazarus’ film 
“The Morning Ritual,” which won the Hometowner Award at the 2001 Indie 
Memphis Film Festival for Narrative Short. “The Morning Ritual” also 
received a Darrell Award in 2002 from the Memphis Science-Fiction 
Association. In addition, the film was runner-up at the 2002 Nashville International 
Film Festival where, although not a winner, it was treated as a winner 
and delivered to and screened for the Directors’ Guild.</p>

teach himself filmmaking by making films. In 2005 he produced “US,” a 
short film written by his older brother, which he eventually released in
 2010. In 2008, he portrayed Ace in J. Michael McCarthy’s “Cigarette

<b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b>
</div><div> <p>As stated above Rising Fyre Productions is currently seeking $3,000 for financing ""Through The Eyes."" Production will be total of 2 days production 12 hours per day.This will allow us to pay our actors, build set design, food, editing, and have some money set aside in case it is needed during production. Any and all money raised will go into a secure account for the film and withdrawn as needed. In the event that we do not raise our Finance goal that will not stop us from completing the film. We will go into production but will not be able to pay our actors and key members for there services. We hope in all costs that we will be able to give those who are deserving there due pay. If only a portion of our goal is raised we will still secure the funds in an account and withdraw as needed and complete the film with what we have. We want to give those who donated funds a completed product for what they could give us.  </p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> With more films today moving toward instant steaming outlets such as Netflix, itunes and Hulu, we plan on distributing ""Through The Eyes"" and 
""Coldblooded"" together exclusively on amazon Instant Video and will be 
available for rent and purchase after the film as been completed. The success of ""Coldblooded"" came as a surprise to Rising Fyre Productions and everyone involved. With a special thank you to Bateman Underwood, lead actor of ""ColdBlooded"" for making it happen. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1155028/files/20150117012048-375841_4556309914454_1973051992_n.jpg?1421486448"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>As filmmakers we also must understand the reality of the business we are in. Investing in film is one of the most risky investments to make due to the unpredictability, and instability of the film business. A lot of things can go wrong and schedules can change at any moment.

</div></div>","Short Summary ""Through The Eyes"" is a short film with a look into the world of a serial killer from his point of view. A raw and real journey into insanity with a psychological and thriller focus. This short will be filmed on a Go pro video camera which will be shot in pov.


Jamie Hall: Jessie James Hall has always had a passion for all 
the arts, music, 
painting, sculptures, and above all cinema and film. As a child of only 
10 years of age he was placed behind the camera for the first time when 
his grandfather, George Hall, purchased a V/H/S home video camera. 
Jessie found himself directing his action figures in various short 
films. Mr. Hall’s grandfather also influenced his artistic eye by 
introducing him to such horror greats as Alfred Hitchcock, Rod Sterling,
 and Vincent Price. As Jessie grew older he discovered many more 
directors such as Stanley Kubrick, The Cohen brothers, Martin Scorsese, 
David and Jennifer Lynch who influenced his style even more.



In his early 20’s Jessie did abandon film for a brief period to per sue
 his love for playing East Coast Hardcore and Punk style music.He was approached by the Bravo Channel to film pilot for a reality 
television show in titled “The List”. He has worked with other networks 
such as VH1 as Director of Photography for the Kita Williams reality 
show. It was there that he meet his soon to be best friend and business 
partner, J. Lazarus Hawk. The team of Hall and Hawk decided to join 
forces and operate the company Rising Fyre Productions.


Mr. Hawk better known as Laz in the Memphis film community was 
interested in a script that Jessie co-wrote and planned to direct titled
 “ Cold Blooded”. Filming for ""Cold Blooded"" commenced on January 19, 2012 
and wrapped March 5, 2012. Cold Blooded was the first film Jessie ever 
premiered to the public. Met with rave reviews and heartfelt criticism, 
his first official short film inspired him to get started on his first 
feature length film. 






J. Lazarus Hawk: 


In July, 1997, after spending a decade in Connecticut, Lazarus moved to 
Memphis, Tennessee, where he met film director Craig Brewer, who gave 
him his first opportunity to work in film. He played a drug dealer in 
Craig’s film “The Poor and Hungry.





Two years later, Craig served as Executive Producer on Lazarus’ film 
“The Morning Ritual,” which won the Hometowner Award at the 2001 Indie 
Memphis Film Festival for Narrative Short. “The Morning Ritual” also 
received a Darrell Award in 2002 from the Memphis Science-Fiction 
Association. In addition, the film was runner-up at the 2002 Nashville International 
Film Festival where, although not a winner, it was treated as a winner 
and delivered to and screened for the Directors’ Guild.

From there, Lazarus founded Rising Fyre Productions and proceeded to 
teach himself filmmaking by making films. In 2005 he produced “US,” a 
short film written by his older brother, which he eventually released in
 2010. In 2008, he portrayed Ace in J. Michael McCarthy’s “Cigarette 
Girl.” Also in 2010, he wrote, produced, and directed a short film 
entitled “Words of a Father.”
Keith Goff:﻿​Born Br​​​​​​ian Keith Goff in Grenada, Mississippi, on March 22, 1973. After
 graduating High School, Keith went to the Mississippi State Fire 
Academy and became a full-time employee with the local Fire Department. ​​​​



Keith
 then decided that he wanted to become a Police Officer and attended the
 Mississippi Law Enforcement Officer's Training Academy and went to work
 as a Police Officer. ​​​​​

He is presently employed as a Police Officer in the Fugitive/Warrant Division.​ Keith
 entered the film industry in 2011 after auditioning for a Feature 
Length Film entitled ""Trey"". Keith landed the lead role, as the main 
character (Trey). ​​​  
Film
 'Trey"" was entered in the 2013 AOF International Film Festival, held in
 Pasadena, California, and won the category for Best Feature Film.  Since this award winning film, Keith's career has taken off landing him on a major production set with HBO/Cinemax in 2013.
This
 has opened many doors and opportunities for Keith to work with A-Lists 
celebrities and a well-known Director in the Film and TV Industry.

What We Need & What You Get
 As stated above Rising Fyre Productions is currently seeking $3,000 for financing ""Through The Eyes."" Production will be total of 2 days production 12 hours per day.This will allow us to pay our actors, build set design, food, editing, and have some money set aside in case it is needed during production. Any and all money raised will go into a secure account for the film and withdrawn as needed. In the event that we do not raise our Finance goal that will not stop us from completing the film. We will go into production but will not be able to pay our actors and key members for there services. We hope in all costs that we will be able to give those who are deserving there due pay. If only a portion of our goal is raised we will still secure the funds in an account and withdraw as needed and complete the film with what we have. We want to give those who donated funds a completed product for what they could give us.  
  The Impact With more films today moving toward instant steaming outlets such as Netflix, itunes and Hulu, we plan on distributing ""Through The Eyes"" and 
""Coldblooded"" together exclusively on amazon Instant Video and will be 
available for rent and purchase after the film as been completed. The success of ""Coldblooded"" came as a surprise to Rising Fyre Productions and everyone involved. With a special thank you to Bateman Underwood, lead actor of ""ColdBlooded"" for making it happen. 




   Risks & Challenges As filmmakers we also must understand the reality of the business we are in. Investing in film is one of the most risky investments to make due to the unpredictability, and instability of the film business. A lot of things can go wrong and schedules can change at any moment. We cant guarantee that people will be lining up to see our film or see it at all but we are risk takers at heart and we go into every project we do with an open mind prepared for any challenge we must encounter. Our devoted production team and company members of Rising Fyre Productions move forward with hard work and persistence with any hurdles we may encounter and most importantly work as a team to solve problems in the jobs we do. It is hard work to make films but the reward of seeing our hard work on screen is well worth the effort not only to ourselves  but the ones who were willing to take a leap of faith with us along the way.    Other Ways You Can Help We understand that not everyone can contribute financing and that is perfectly understandable. We are all trying our best to save what we can but that doesn't mean you cant help. We encourage you to help by talking to friends, family and people you may know to help us make this film.

</h3><p><b>Our
Vision</b></p>
<p>Our vision is expand our generous and
joyous Australian community to embrace the families of one small
Balinese mountain village near Mt Batur. 
We want the children of this village to benefit from secure housing,
high school education and future career opportunities, just as we
want to learn from the example of their simple, cheerful sharing
approach to life.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1183903/files/20150130031614-Making_tea.JPEG?1422616574"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Such beautifully generous hospitality making us tea when obviously it is very precious.</span></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">About the village</b></p>
<p>These Balinese families live a simple,
humble lifestyle with few opportunities to build a secure future. 
Rice farming is the main source of income although the farming season
only lasts three months and the farmers are hired to work the land
rather than owning the rice fields.  There are few opportunities for
earning money and limited opportunities for education.  While the
government provides assistance for children to attend primary school,
there is no government assistance for high school.  Also there are no
high schools in the mountains so parents face the additional cost of
travel.</p>
<p>One rice farmer lives with his wife,
father and four young daughters in a makeshift hut built after their
original home blew down in a storm. Outside the farming season, his
only means of income is wood carving – he can make one carving a
day, valued at one dollar.   He wants his four daughters – twins
aged 10, and twins aged 4 – to be able to go to high school when
they are older but he does not know how that will be possible. 

</p>
<p>Another villager is a bike
tour guide and the father of two daughters.  He dreams of becoming a
driver tour guide yet saving to purchase a car is near impossible.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1183904/files/20150130031728-KITCHEN.JPEG?1422616648"" src="""" style=""""/>            <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Kitchen floods in wet weather.</span></p><p><b>Our Mission</b></p>
<p>We want to raise $5000 to help this
family build a strong durable home on the site of their original
home.  Any additional funds raised will go towards a sponsorship
program for the children of the village so they can attend high
school.</p>
<p>The family are proud and humble people,
so they wish to remain anonymous.  For the same reason, we cannot
share the name of the village.  However, we do have permission to
provide photos so you can see the results of your generosity.   </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1183907/files/20150130031844-IMG_6490.JPG?1422616724"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This picture shows the ancient foundations to the families home in the village that collapsed in a storm. </span></p><h3></h3>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In October 2014 I headed over to Bali
for my Birthday with a friend of mine, My friend <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">has been to Bali many times and
assured me that all the negative talk about 9 Australians dying every
month over there was Media Hype..Bali is her sacred healing place and
she spoke so highly of the humble culture and beautiful healing land.
She soon had me convinced so off I went with an open heart and I am
so so grateful that I did.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>While over there I took myself off on a
30km bike tour from Mt Batur to Ubud. My friend had already
done this ride on one of her previous trips and so I decided i would
go alone. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The day before I went I met a lovely
Australian / English woman, at the Motel.  I convinced her to
join me and what a day we had!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Our Tour guides  were
amazing. I was really taken at how well one guide could speak English of
which he was incredibly proud. We struck up a lovely friendship and I
am excited to say that he has invited me to come and stay in his
village with his wife and 2 daughters when I return in March. I am
most excited at this because being a tourist and being part of a
village community are two entirely different things.</p>
<p> (I will elaborate on our sibling like friendship later!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>While on our ride he shared with us
all about his ancient culture and the way the Balinese  mountain
villagers live. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I felt I was receiving a precious
insight into a most humble beautiful people.</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I felt in awe of the beauty both in the
visual surrounds and also within the people. Such love pours from
their eyes it was very humbling an experience for me.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We stopped at a Rice farmers home. Our guide explained that the tour company he works for helps support
these farmers families with their children’s school accessories
like books, pens etc for allowing their home and life to be shown to
'tourists'. I felt awkward at first , as if I was trespassing  But
the warmth and welcoming embrace that I received from the farmers
wife was incredible. She made us refreshing tea in glasses and it was
clear that the tea is precious . Money and belongings were barely
existent. Our guide explained that this beautiful family <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">(Grandpa,
Father, Mother, twin girls age 10 and twin girls age 4) were living
on the same ground that had been their ancestors for possibly
hundreds of years. He explained that their incredibly meagre dwelling
was makeshift as their home had blown down in a storm. He showed us
the foundations of where their home once stood and it was no larger
then my kitchen! (see Pictures)</span></p>
<p>Their cooking was one clay pot over an
earth brick fire, Water carried via buckets from the river and walls
made of packing crates and sacks,Yet they had such humble joy and
shared with us their precious tea .</p>
<p>I sat and watched with a huge lump in
my throat . Thoughts drifted in and out 
</p>
<p>”I will never complain again”</p>
<p>“I love my toilet I will never whinge
that it needs cleaning ever again”</p>
<p>”OMG I love my bed and my soft
pillows”</p>
<p>“the luxury of running water, both
hot and cold”...</p>
<p>My head was whirling as our guides talk
drifted in and out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I knew I could help in some way.</p>
<p>The little 4 year old identical twins
smiles twinkled at me and there was an instant love affair happening
as the rest of the group were fixated on our guides speech.</p>
<p>I looked deep into the mothers eyes and
she saw I had tears. She shuffled closer and held my hand for a
moment. This memory still brings a lump to my throat. I found a
dollar in my pocket as I had not brought my bag.. I subtly handed it
to her.She did not want to take it and I gestured it was for the
young twins and so she obliged with such a humbleness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our guide soon had us all on our bikes and
I found the rest of the journey on the ride I spent thinking of how I
could somehow help this struggling family.</p>
<p>Our guide explained to me at the end of the
trip after much probing that Rice farming is only 3 months of the
year. The farmers don’t own the land, they are just the workers and
are some of the poorest people in Bali. Once Rice season is finished
they have to survive in what ever way they can. This beautiful
families father had learned the art of wood carving and had mastered
one carving type, a seahorse that he could produce one per day . He raised the equivalent of one Australian dollar per day for these
carvings!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked our guide how much would it cost to
rebuild their dwelling considering the foundations are still there,
(see pictures) he replied $500 for 4 poles and straw roof or
$5000 for a proper building with walls and windows. I asked how long
would it take them to do this as I am concerned about the wet season
coming. He said ""they just wont be able to do it, they wont ever save
that sort of money.""</p>
<p>I felt deeply saddened and said to our guide I am going to do what ever I can to help them get a roof over
their head. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My friend (our guide) and I have continued to keep in
touch, We are face-book friends (yes they have internet!) I feel privileged and he has
shared a lot with me about his life as well.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">He lives as a bike tour guide, his

he said he is back at work which I was delighted to hear ,then he
sent me a photo of his wrist and my heart plummeted. It is clearly
still broken and shows a clear deformity now in the bone. I struggled
to comprehend how he could still be riding a bike with his wrist like
this.(see picture)</span></p>
