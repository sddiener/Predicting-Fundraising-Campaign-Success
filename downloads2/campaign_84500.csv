Este tipo de oportunidades no se deben desaprovechar y nosotros como banda buscamos llevar un espectáculo y una calidad que sea digna representante de nuestro país en cualquier parte del mundo. Si logramos realizar este tour de forma exitosa como lo tenemos planeado, ustedes amigos habrán sido parte de un paso muy grande e importante en nuestra carrera musical como banda y en nuestras carreras independientes como músicos!

<h3>A DONDE VAN LOS FONDOS RECAUDADOS?</h3>
<p>Todo lo recaudado será destinado a todos los gastos de renta backline/transporte durante el tour “INVASION CHECA” que son del día 9 de Julio al 15 de Julio del 2019, la producción y grabación de un nuevo video totalmente hecho por nosotros en diferentes partes de Europa durante la estadía, los gastos de vuelos extras del Crew extra involucrado para la producción del video, toda la impresión de mercancía y envíos correspondientes, si logramos esto y empujamos con todo nuestro esfuerzo este proyecto que es tan enormemente ambicioso, de verdad amigos van a volverse locos con el material que vamos a darles! Ya no podemos esperar más de la emoción!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>EL IMPACTO</h3>
<p>Esto nos ha tomado por sorpresa, pues nos llegó la noticia en este 2019 y nos hemos concentrado en planear como aprovechar de mejor manera esta oportunidad, a base de eso hemos logrado que nuestros amigos en República Checa nos ubiquen de mejor manera, con la alineación actual por fin encontramos un equipo que se siente libre, potente, seguro y ambicioso de tocar en todos los escenarios que se nos abran, ustedes amigos merecen lo mejor de nosotros y no duden que haremos todo por que se lo merecen mas que nadie, hemos estado en tour desde hace mas de 5 años y nuestros seguidores siempre han visto nuestra entrega en cada show, ellos mismos nos han preguntado cuando ocurrirá un tour en Europa, ahora es el momento! Hagamos este tour y este video memorables para nuestro país y para todos! Con tu ayuda lo podemos lograr!!!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>OTRAS MANERAS DE PODER AYUDAR!</h3>

Es mucho muy difícil para los músicos como nosotros llevar estas metas acabo, nuestras situaciones financieras no pueden soportar en lo absoluto un proyecto de esta magnitud, es por esto que necesitamos de su ayuda amigos! No tenemos una disquera que nos respalde, solo estamos nosotros 5, nuestro Crew, nuestras ganas y deseos de llegar lejos, más lejos de lo que se ha llegado antes, este proyecto es lo que podría ser la diferencia para nosotros en nuestras carreras. De nuevo amigos, no podemos estar mas emocionados y preparados para esto! Estamos muy ansiosos de que todos vean y escuchen el video que estamos planeando!

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is Timothy Britten Jr. and the name of my gospel group is TBJ &amp; Holy Nation. I've always had a passion for music. I started playing piano at the age of 7 and then fell in love with playing music. At a young age I loved how music lifted me up when I was down, calmed me when I wanted to do something that I might regret, and made me want to be a better person. I decided that I wanted to help others through music the way that it has helped me through many hard times. That's why my group (Holy Nation) and I are making this project. To encourage people to follow Jesus through different types of music. The core of our ministry is gospel and we desire to spread the love of Christ as far as we can. I believe that stepping out musically will extend our reach to many more people in need of encouragement and love.</p>
<p><strong>What does it sound like?</strong></p>
<p>This is a very musical project. If you enjoy bands like Snarky Puppy and artist such as PJ Morton, Joe Sample, Vashawn Mitchell, Earnest Pugh, Eric Benet, Chick Corea and Cory Henry &amp; The Funk Apostles then I believe you will enjoy this project. Music creates emotions. It can change the atmosphere. On this project, each track is different from the last. Some songs will put a smile on your face and make you want to move. Some songs will close out everything that's going in the wrong direction in your life and let you know that with Jesus, everything is going to be alright. I believe in diversity; so there's a song for everybody on this project.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is truly a dream that I've had for many years and I believe that Holy Nation and I are equipped for it. But to fulfill this dream it's going to take funds. We're going to use these funds for studio time, mixing and mastering, compensate the musicians, provide professional camera team, music promotion and make sure everything is at top quality from music to even merchandise. </p>
<p>As a thank you for your support you can choose from multiple gifts plus perks including digital downloads, signed CD's, our t-shirts and more.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not able to help financially right now, that's fine. Please help by sharing this campaign and spreading the word on facebook and other social media platforms. Your help makes all the difference.</p>
<p>Thank you so much and God Bless You!</p>

<h3>I'm at a choice point. Your decision will help me decide.</h3>
<p>Over the past 2 and a half years, with the gracious support and feedback of my Patreon music blog subscribers, I’ve written 16 new songs, covered 9 more and posted around 40 recordings. The 10 songs in ""Sky"" are the cream of the crop. They were recorded in my living room on my Macbook and carry the energy that was present at the birth of the songs. There is spontaneity, vulnerability and a bit of magic -- and a lot of love in these recordings.</p>
<p>I’m now at a choice point and I need your input.</p>
<p>Is this music a blessing for a few or a powerful contribution for a wider audience?</p>
<p>I want to be clear that I’m going to release this album regardless of the outcome of this campaign (if you've ever been 40 weeks pregnant or were close to someone who was, you know what I mean). I can do it on a shoestring and only reach a few people, or do it bigger and reach more. The question that you can help me answer is, what do I have to work with when manufacturing and promoting and performing the music? </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Am Asking For &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Below is a chart that gives an overview of what I'm requesting in three phases from the most basic to the most abundant.  There are a couple of shorthand references on the chart explained in more detail below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Piano repairs: </strong>My mighty but elderly Roland digital piano has developed some problems over the years that have me borrowing my son’s newer piano. I’m grateful that he will share but but I prefer the higher quality and power of the older Roland.</li>
<li>
<strong>Additional songs #1 and #2: </strong>with additional funds I would be able to set aside the time and space to record two more of my new songs and get them ready for the wider world. While not necessary for the album to hang together, they would be awesome additions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Personal Expenses: </strong> The final phase of bringing the music to the general public is a time and energy intensive process, and having a financial buffer will allow me the ability to have clearer and more powerful focus for it.</li>

</div><div>
<h3>Why raise funds if I could produce the CD on a shoestring like my other albums?</h3>
<p>I've been writing and recording songs since 2008 as my personal practice, acutely aware of the way that music affects me on every level, and I have wanted to make sounds that help me access the mental and emotional states I want to experience, and also benefit other people who are listening to it. Sharing the music has been a wonderfully organic and serendipitous process up to the present moment, and I've had many people write and tell me that this music has made a powerful difference in their lives whether they are listening to it during their commutes, relaxing in a yoga studio or while doing tai chi, sharing it in hospice settings or playing it to their unborn children and new babies . . . </p>
<p>I am so grateful for the synchronistic way that the music seems to travel where I could never have predicted and I feel mind-blown and blessed by the number of people who tell me how much my music means to them. But I am feeling a shift and the sense that there is a wider world that would benefit from having the vibrations that are coming through this process that is increasingly a shared and community process. I am envisioning having a team of musicians who help to bring the songs I've written into a whole new level of expression and being able to pay them honest money for their dedication and gifts.</p>
<p>And with your help, we'll do it.</p>

<li>It's easy and convenient to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

<p>As many of you guys know, I have been making music for the last 15 years. From Power Metal to more extreme genres, I always did put all my guts and passion in what I do. My power metal past gave me more experience, technique and recognition in the local metal scene. My first album with the band Eclipse Prophecy named ""Days of Judgement"" was released worldwide and was generally acclaimed pretty much everywhere it went. </p>
<p>Now it's time for me to complete my Blackened Death Metal solo project. I started to work on this in 2012 when I released my first 5 tracks EP named ""Spiritual Genocide"". I did put this project on ice for a while but decided to complete it for good. In the last few months I did write several tracks and got up to 18 original tracks that are featured on this double album and will also feature guest solos from several bands in the local and international scene (Confirmations to follow).</p>
<p>The tracklist goes as follow:</p>
<p>ACT I - Spiritual Genocide<br/><br/>Spiritual Genocide<br/>Enter the Cataclysm<br/>Reptilian Queen<br/>Eye of the Cyclone <br/>Barbaric<br/>Extreme Game of Power <br/>Spiraling Darkness Insight<br/>Existence is Futile<br/>The Walking Dead (Original song inspired by the TV Series)<br/>Epilogue (Darkest Descent)<br/>----------------------------------------------------<br/>ACT II - The Darkest Descent<br/><br/>Gargantua<br/>Chimera<br/>The Blackening<br/>Morbid Prototype<br/>The Flesh of God<br/>Abyssal Screams<br/>Volatile<br/>Heathens Sailing Over the Northern Tides<br/>Black Dragon (Dissection cover)<br/>The Road to Devastation (Kataklysm cover) <br/><br/>As you can see this is going to be a HUGE album. A total of 20 songs spanned on 2 CDs, with a total of over 100 minutes of music! This is why we need YOUR help with this. Since it's a LOT of material the production cost is pretty expensive. I am recording and mixing everything myself, took a lot of time to design the logo, the album cover, and even every single t-shirt design. I used a lot of my own time and money for this.<br/><br/>I hope to raise $3500 CAD with this campaign, helping me to pay for a big part of the album. I will always be grateful for everyone that supported me over the years and hope to be able to keep making music for a long time ahead! I am making a lineup to play concerts eventually so don't worry, you WILL be seeing this project live in the coming future! Stay connected for more! Until then, STAY METAL!</p>

<h3>Our story:</h3>
<p>Meaning The Originals in Swahili, Asili was created through our shared passion for creating music. Founded by a group of friends who shared in the joy of making music together, the members of Asili Vocal Ensemble started their musical journeys singing for the South African National Youth Choir, where they all fell in love with each other on a harmonic sphere. </p>
<p><br/>Since its foundation in 2018, Asili has made huge strides in terms of the scope and range of performances. Apart from private functions, some of their performance highlights include performing with the Cape Philharmonic Orchestra and renowned opera singer Aviva Pelham on the SoundsCape and CPO Spectacular productions in 2019 as well as performing live on South African breakfast show Expresso. </p>
<p><br/>Built on love, respect and the representation of musical diversity, the sounds of Asili are deeply intertwined with traditional African choral undertones while incorporating classical, opera, pop and jazz into our sound. Our mission is to create magical, music moments that warm the hearts of our audiences and brings people together. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need: </h3>
<p>In association with Namaste Works Arts Alliance, the Asili Vocal Ensemble has been invited to take part in the following international program:</p>
<p>A 5-day cultural exchange, where we'll be leading a workshop with young adults from Denver. </p>
<p>During this masterclass series, we'll be engaging with young performing artists from different backgrounds and sharing our unique South African culture and lessons we've learnt since the start of our performance careers. This is also an opportunity for us to hone our skills under the guidance, coaching and instruction of accomplished Broadway artists while connecting with fellow students who share the same artistic passions. </p>
<p>In addition to the masterclass series, our stay in Denver will culminate in a performance with the Boulder Symphony Orchestra, where we'll be performing a selection of contemporary favourites, beloved classics and traditional African repertoire.</p>
<p>This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for us and we need your help to make this dream a reality! While we’ve covered our U.S. expenses, we still need to raise funds for air travel, Visa expenses and travel insurance.</p>
<p>With 10 vocalists, a musical director, a videographer and tour manager on board, here's a breakdown of our travel expenses:</p>
<p>As flights are subject to availability and cost, we've estimated that we need at least $20 000 to go towards air travel. </p>
<p>A further $ 5000 will be allocated to VISA applications and travel insurance. </p>
<p>Right now, our musical director, videographer and tour manager are volunteering their time and skills but ideally we'd like to get them paid. In the event, we raise more than what's required to get us overseas, we'd include a fee for the work they've put into making this tour happen. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While we'd be thrilled to share our cultural heritage with the world, our real mission is to transform the South African music industry through the promotion of diversity and inclusivity.</p>
<p>Any additional funding will be allocated to creating a workshop series for underprivileged kids in South Africa. Utilising the knowledge and skills we'll gain in Denver, this workshop series is not only an opportunity to give back to our communities but also a way to continue to bring people together through the love of music. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge right now is funding.</p>
<p>Many of the necessary steps such as Visa applications and flight ticket purchases require funding to move forward. </p>
<p>While we've saved up to create promotional material to assist with our campaign and all expenses when we touch down in the U.S.A are covered, our biggest concern is that we'll not be able to raise enough capital to proceed with our Visa applications and flight tickets.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We, more than most, understand that not everyone has the means to contribute financially. </p>
<p>You can still help us by sharing our campaign. We've worked out that if 5000 people donate $5 each, we'll be able to reach our funding target, so getting the word out there is integral to realising our funding goal. </p>

<li>We have 7 unique perks and or packages which will include some of our fine merchandise directly from our ""Seven Day Sons Pop-Up Shop."" </li>
<li>Along with this campaign, we filmed 3 live-full band videos at Avbury Studios, which we will be hosting to Facebook &amp; YouTube starting October 7th. Our campaign closes on November 28th, 2017. Extention with ""Indiegogo InDemand"" on January 7th, 2018. </li>

From that point, we then need to be marketing the single along with the record on social media &amp; YouTube. Later, we'd be pitching our LP singles to radio, hire a PR representative to talk to industry professionals about our record - and finally, going on tour. This is just a summary of the process behind recording an album.

<h3>My name is KRENA,  and I am changing the way people hear Contemporary Soul/R&amp;B Music. </h3>
<p>I am an Alternative R&amp;B and Electro Soul artist from Brooklyn, NY.  What most people don't know about me is that I am apart of an Astrological Spiritual Community of Readers, Healers and those who have overcome trauma. I began my musical journey as a youth performing in Music Theatre shows. Creating music with a story and meaning is my passion. </p>
<h3>If you love Alicia Keys and Audra Day, then you may enjoy the sound of 'MANTRAS'.</h3>
<p>People have compared my style to the Swedish, Electronic Soul band ""Little Dragon"". My main thing has been along the lines of alternative/indie r&amp;b with overtones of soul and undertones of jazz. However, my culture is definitive; new age spirituality.</p>
<p>Being a visionary creative person is challenging and fulfilling. I love being free to create and yet it is so important to me to release high-quality productions. This is why funding is so important in this project. I want to release an EP that is impactful and will reach those who need to hear it. All the while, keeping my priorities to my family as a new mom!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>THE STORY BEHIND 'MANTRAS'</h3>
<p>I've had serious phases of feeling insecurity, sadness and just being stuck. I self medicated for years on marijuana.  I was tired of being someone for everyone else. I wanted to live life free. And for me that became an addiction.</p>
<p>But it's not marijuana that was the problem. It's not the perceived enemy that is <i>ever</i> the problem. Because if it's not drugs, then its sugar, if its not sugar, then its sex..and then it's something else. All these things have no game, unless I choose to play it. It was my addictive need for relief. I wanted to push down feelings of shame, loneliness, and abandonment. The feeling I hated the most was the FEELING of desire, When you have big dreams...you have big desires. And the feeling of desire without results, was too painful to bare.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561539966/rdmr2v3mfvnke3kesghf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/>Everyday I am learning to be okay with wanting and needing what I do not have. During my 2 years of sobriety, I had been writing music about my sexual freedom and expression. I was creating a whole different sound. But, I felt something was missing. An origin story was the missing link. 'Mantras' is the origin story of how I healed myself back from addiction.  'Mantras' came to me in a daydream vision of a Sunflower. It was then, that I decided to take a left turn from what I was creating, and prioritize the release of 'Mantras' for Summer 2019. </p>

<p>The music is about self-love and overcoming challenging phases in life. I am aiming for a release date of August 6, 2019.</p>

I know this music is going to help all of those who are growing out of their darkness and who are turning towards their own light. I call these types... The Sunflower Gang.</p>

I've always had that deep love for it, like you just can't explain it, and you know that you have to do everything you can to have more of it! Music is  in my blood! My grandmother was a singer/performer in a country jamboree band that traveled between Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri, and all over the tri-state area. She was also in many local country showdowns  as well.  I took the stage at the young age of 8 years old, and I can still remember it like it was yesterday. I got up in front of 2000 or more people and sung Achy Breaky Heart by Billy Ray Cyrus, and The Thunder Rolls by Garth Brooks.</p><p>After that my life took a darker turn. My mother at the time had a mental illness and she was deemed unfit to take care of us kids, so we were sent off to a foster home, long story short our dad saved us, and took us home to live with him.</p><p>I grew up writing what was to me at the time silly songs, and I noticed that my love for music grew stronger with each new experience in my life. I would spend hours alone in my room, just playing the piano, or coming up with words to songs.</p><p> </p><p>Fast Forward, because you guys do not want to hear about every detail of my life...</p><p>I joined the Army, took my keyboard as a way of holding onto my roots. I got involved with the wrong people, and I got into drugs, alcohol, and other substances, which led down a path to depression and a few suicide attempts. I suffered through one failed relationship after another. I lived to tell this story, and somehow by the grace of God, I am alive today, so that I can write these beautiful songs for you.</p><p>All of the songs on this album, I wrote about something that was going on in my life, whether it was a breakup, drug addiction, surviving suicide attempts, to writing songs about my mother's mental illness.</p><p>I've received so many positive testimonies from you guys, and that has made me want to get this music out to you even more!</p><p>I am putting my music career in your hands, and relying solely on fan support!</p><p>I've put together a 10 song full length album that has a little something for everyone in it!</p><p> </p><p>A couple of my main key points is, I want to bring awareness to suicide, mental illness, and addiction into the light with songs like ""Alice"", ""Momma Went Crazy"", and ""Don't Grab Your Gun"", or people struggling with their self image with songs like ""Flawless"".</p><p> </p><p>I hope that after hearing my music, that you leave with a better understanding that forgiveness is possible, your not alone in hard times, you can get through anything life throws at you, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and with a lot of hard work, dedication, and determination, you to can make your dreams come true!</p><p> </p><p><strong>WHY INDIEGOGO?</strong></p><p>Well I would love to be able to do this on my own, but the truth is, without a label, or financial backing, it's very hard and very expensive to make music. That is why I am leaving my career in the hands of God, and you guys! That is why I created this campaign, because I believe I have the best fans in the entire universe, and together we can make this happen! By pre-ordering my album, or buying some of the awesome rewards  I am offering you guys, you can help make the album of my dreams.</p><p>Have you ever been in a music video before?  Well... this could be your chance! I have written the perfect music video, and I just know that we are going to have a LOT of fun filming together, and we'll be able to remember it for the rest of our lives!  </p><p><strong>YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY...</strong></p><p>If you choose to put your faith, and hard earned money behind this project, I can't begin to thank you enough! Each dollar will go to good use, and make this album more than I ever dreamed possible! I am a HUGE dreamer, and an even bigger worker, and I know for a fact that you will not be disappointed in what I create! I have all the songs written, the arrangements arranged, recording dates set, and everything ready to go once I hit my goal!</p><p>Also anyone who backs  this project with $1 or more will automatically be entered into my Dustin's Diamonds Facebook Fan Group, where you will get access to my P.O. Box, plus a lot of other cool behind the scenes stuff! </p><p> </p><p>I cannot wait to get started making the music for this album!

I got involved with the wrong people, and I got into drugs, alcohol, and other substances, which led down a path to depression and a few suicide attempts. I suffered through one failed relationship after another. I lived to tell this story, and somehow by the grace of God, I am alive today, so that I can write these beautiful songs for you.All of the songs on this album, I wrote about something that was going on in my life, whether it was a breakup, drug addiction, surviving suicide attempts, to writing songs about my mother's mental illness.I've received so many positive testimonies from you guys, and that has made me want to get this music out to you even more!I am putting my music career in your hands, and relying solely on fan support!I've put together a 10 song full length album that has a little something for everyone in it! A couple of my main key points is, I want to bring awareness to suicide, mental illness, and addiction into the light with songs like ""Alice"", ""Momma Went Crazy"", and ""Don't Grab Your Gun"", or people struggling with their self image with songs like ""Flawless"". I hope that after hearing my music, that you leave with a better understanding that forgiveness is possible, your not alone in hard times, you can get through anything life throws at you, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and with a lot of hard work, dedication, and determination, you to can make your dreams come true! WHY INDIEGOGO?Well I would love to be able to do this on my own, but the truth is, without a label, or financial backing, it's very hard and very expensive to make music. That is why I am leaving my career in the hands of God, and you guys! That is why I created this campaign, because I believe I have the best fans in the entire universe, and together we can make this happen! By pre-ordering my album, or buying some of the awesome rewards  I am offering you guys, you can help make the album of my dreams.Have you ever been in a music video before?  Well... this could be your chance! I have written the perfect music video, and I just know that we are going to have a LOT of fun filming together, and we'll be able to remember it for the rest of our lives!  YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY...If you choose to put your faith, and hard earned money behind this project, I can't begin to thank you enough! Each dollar will go to good use, and make this album more than I ever dreamed possible! I am a HUGE dreamer, and an even bigger worker, and I know for a fact that you will not be disappointed in what I create! I have all the songs written, the arrangements arranged, recording dates set, and everything ready to go once I hit my goal!Also anyone who backs  this project with $1 or more will automatically be entered into my Dustin's Diamonds Facebook Fan Group, where you will get access to my P.O. Box, plus a lot of other cool behind the scenes stuff!  I cannot wait to get started making the music for this album! I just know you guys are going to love it just as much as I do! Love Dustin  Here is what the CD will look like! (Not necessarily in this order) 1. Flawless2. Rain3. Momma Talks To Jesus4. Don't Grab Your Gun5. Hurricane6. Leila 7. Never Lookin Back8. Alice 9. Strong Love10. Take The Train  Directly under my introduction video to my Indiegogo campaign is a few pictures and videos for your guy's viewing and listening pleasure!

My name is Mike Turnbull & I am an indie-folk singer-songwriter based in the Lake District, UK.

I am a soon-to-be music graduate with political interests, I am one of the many who oppose the UK's air strikes in Syria that have just been voted for. 

I am starting a risk free project to promote anti-war sentiment and show that we as a population do not wish to bomb other countries or go to war. 

The aim is to promote disarmament and peace, as opposed to what Mr. Cameron proposes. 

Also, I am apparently a ""terrorist sympathiser"" for disagreeing, really?",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello, people, my name is Kevin David Marín Quiñonez aka KDMQ, I’m a self-taught musician from México, to be specific, from the northern part of the country, in Durango. And I want to be part of the Icelandic Airwaves Music Festival 2017. But, I need money to pay the artist fee for the submission.</p>
<p>As a self-taught musician, or as I call myself “Non-Artist”, I learned that you can’t get the things that you want that easy, and especially a Mexican, I need to work my self ten times harder to get or reach what I want.</p>
<p>The music I made is a mixture between Alternative and Experimental with a little touch of electronics and analogic instruments, such as tape recorders, pianos, ukuleles, guitar, drum machines and more.</p>
<p>For a long time ago I wanted to be part of a music festival, especially outside from México, and what a better festival like the “Icelandic Airwaves” in Iceland. When I discovered the festival and that it was hosted in one of my favorite places (Iceland), I dreamed about being one of the artists that would be on the line-up of something. So you can imagine my ecstasy when I discover that they accept “artist submissions”, I went like crazy to the web page and make the whole application, and to my surprise, I need to pay “20 Dollars” to send it.</p>
<p>So that's when you come to help me, for an artist and student as well, get 20 dollars, in México, where it's about like 600 pesos, it’s kinda hard, so please people, if you can help it would be amazing, if you can’t, you can always share this with other people.</p>
<br/>With all of your donations you would help me to pay the “artist fee”, and get a chance to be on one of the greatest festivals ever, plus theres other ways you can help me, you can get my music in kdmq.bandcamp.com.</div><p> </p><p>Y eso es todo.</p></div>","Hey what's up!

</div></div>","FEED TOUR ROMA Dopo la tappa di Milano che potete vedere nel video siamo pronti a scendere nella capitale, nella città eterna, Roma

il FEED TOUR è un occasione per far risaltare youtube come strumento non fatto solo di pixel ma di esseri umani e relazioni, non serve una partita a bowling tra youtuber per parlare di youtube ma bisogna creare un luogo e un giorno dove chi ama questo argomento si possa incontrare e dialogare.
Ed infine è un buon modo per diffondere cultura digitale anche tra i meno attenti alle problematiche e alle insidie del web e valorizzare la figura del content creator.

history, second only to James Brown), and are to this day still very much in

soundtrack of the movie “Alfie” (starring British sex symbol Jude Law), which
became a critical success and won a Golden Globe Award. Beyoncé covered one of his co-written songs titled ""I'd Rather Be With You"" as “Be With You” on her Multi Platinum selling
album “Dangerously In Love”. The same song was also covered by the highly
successful British girls band “The Sugababes” under the title “Freak Like Me”.
That same band also sampled another Mudbone song (“Let’s Go All The Way”) for
their hit “Whatever Makes You Happy”. The Sly Fox hit ""Let's Go All The Way"" was in the movie soundtracks of one of the cinemas highest box office grossing successes ""Iron Man 3"" performed by British Pop Star Robbie Williams.  And to top things up it was the theme song for 2015's hottest video game of games, Grand Theft Auto 5.  <br/><b>It just keeps Going All The Way !</b><br/>In addition to his songwriting abilities, Mudbone’s unique vocal style

<h3><b>With Video Diving System you are in control.</b></h3>
<p>Are you tired of holding your GoPro or Smartphone while Diving just to get those awful videos? Do you want to get the best shots or videos without worrying about dropping or losing you GoPro? I have the solution, but I can only bring this product to life with your help.</p>
<p>I am a Civil Engineer but diving made me an inventor. As an independent inventor, I have created and designed some products, but nothing can be done alone, so I went back to college and asked for some help. Together we redesigned the new Video Diving System; the new self-balancing stabilizer for diving cameras and accessories.</p>
<p>Now you can shoot videos and pictures like a professional with your GoPro, smartphone or any other two cameras together.</p>

<p>How many times have you been on a diving trip? You've got everything ready to get in the water and take the best pictures and videos ever, and when you get back out you realize the quality of the images is terrible! Out of focus, blurry, too dim, and so on.</p>

<p>Many know me as an Engineer, but few know that diving made me an Inventor.</p>
<p>I have always loved adventure trips and exploring, and the ocean gives these wonderful activities a whole new meaning.</p>
<p>Since I was young I've had the privilege of sharing adventures with friends that are ocean lovers, who taught me about fishing, sailing, and the handling of a ship with all its responsibilities and safety measures.</p>
<p>Thanks to these experiences I have shared trips and the ocean itself, in a way that I have never been only a spectator, but a part of it, an organizer and even the protagonist.</p>
<p>I've always aimed to organize and arrange my equipment in a better way, but when I tried the GoPro diving, I felt something was missing. Looking for a solution to the lack of light and steadiness is how I came to design the Video Diving System.</p>
<p>This process hasn't been short nor easy, but there are people that have joined the team along the way who have seen the potential of Video Diving System.</p>
<p>I invite you to join this project so we can turn the VDS into a wonderful and very useful reality.</p>

With Video Diving System you are in control.
Are you tired of holding your GoPro or Smartphone while Diving just to get those awful videos? Do you want to get the best shots or videos without worrying about dropping or losing you GoPro? I have the solution, but I can only bring this product to life with your help.
I am a Civil Engineer but diving made me an inventor. As an independent inventor, I have created and designed some products, but nothing can be done alone, so I went back to college and asked for some help. Together we redesigned the new Video Diving System; the new self-balancing stabilizer for diving cameras and accessories.
Now you can shoot videos and pictures like a professional with your GoPro, smartphone or any other two cameras together.
What is Video Diving System?

How many times have you been on a diving trip? You've got everything ready to get in the water and take the best pictures and videos ever, and when you get back out you realize the quality of the images is terrible! Out of focus, blurry, too dim, and so on.
Or maybe you need to document an underwater research job in which you had to spend a lot of money to guarantee the quality of your shots.
Not anymore! With Video Diving System you don´t need to become an octopus with a lot of free hands nor spend lots of money to get great underwater or above-the-surface shots, because now you are in control.* Do not include GoPro bases or BC extension clip. How can I use it?
Video Diving System is a new, redesigned stabilizer made for us who want the best shots out of our GoPros and Smartphones. Even if you are a new diver or snorkeler, it helps improve your underwater shooting by far, even at night.

<h3>CAZIMI EP/ALBUM</h3>
<p>10 years into my Peruivan adventure there is still music flowing out of the desert and the jungle.</p>

<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>For those who are just now being introduced to me, I’ve been singing and performing since I was 7 years old. I started in the church, but grew up around country music and quickly found my passion there. I had amazing role models to look up to, the women of the 90’s (Martina McBride, Faith Hill, Trisha Yearwood, Jo Dee Messina, Jamie O’Neal, etc.) Growing up listening to these women made me believe I could follow my dream just like they did. One of my main goals in my own music career is to inspire other young girls of today, like I was inspired back then.</p>
<p>Over the last 2 years, I’ve been working hard on my songwriting and recording songs I truly believe in. For the first time, unlike past albums I’ve released, I am a part of writing every song on this new album. You’re Gonna Know My Name, the title cut of the record, tells listeners that no matter the struggles I have to face as an independent female artist, and no matter the heartbreaks that this business can dish out, I’m going to keep working as hard as I can to break through, because this is what I truly love. My hope is also that it inspires others chasing their dreams to also not give up and keep pushing past barriers no matter what.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>My goal is to raise $50,000. This amount will cover four main categories:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">(1) The recording, production, design, packaging, and manufacturing of the record</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">(2) Both Texas and national promotions</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">(3) New merchandise design and displays</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">(4) Touring equipment</p>
<p>I have created some very unique perks for my backers! These come in the form of exclusive packages that allow individuals to choose the level of support they wish to contribute. The greater the backing, the greater the perk! Every contributor will receive a copy of the brand new album, and as the levels go up, other things such as a choice between 8 different t-shirt designs, autographed photos, custom koozies, and more are available! At the higher levels of backing, I am offering personal house concerts, recognition on my website and socials, and co-branding opportunities for corporate or local businesses!</p>
<p>If we don’t reach the entire $50,000 goal, I plan on using whatever amount we raise towards the chronological order of the categories I listed above (i.e., the recording will be covered first, then manufacturing, then promotions, etc.).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>It is really difficult to succeed as an independent female artist in Texas. I’ve been so blessed to have had a lot of encouragement and support along the way, for which I’m so grateful, but even so, I STILL encounter roadblocks and glass ceilings on a daily basis with things like booking venues and festivals, getting my songs played, and getting fair opportunities.</p>
<p>That being said, over the last 6 years, I’ve given my everything to my music career, but I am now at a crossroads. I need your help, or I might have to consider looking into things that take me away from music full-time. Your contribution at any level means that I can continue on my God-given path.</p>
<p>I am confident that this new album can be a turning point for me because I saw immense growth in my career with my debut album, Steel (2017). From that album, I won numerous awards, had several successful singles on Texas radio, had a profitable and busy tour schedule, and was headed on an upward trajectory (check out the bio section of my website, <a href=""http://www.hollytucker.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.hollytucker.com</a> for more info). Because of some unfortunate contractual obligations, my career was put on hold for about a year, which really stalled my progress. With your help releasing this new music, I’ll be able to reach new audiences, and grow my brand even bigger than before.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>An independent artist’s biggest challenge is finding and/or creating constant financial support. This is usually where a record label comes in. Nowadays, independent artists can be their own record label. The main “pro” to this is owning the rights and materials to everything (publishing, recordings, tour and merchandise sales, etc. minus expenses). With the release of this new music, I’ll be able to create more media hype, book more gigs, and grow the brand, without having to give a percentage of it to a label.</p>
<p>Another big challenge I face is overcoming the hurdles that come with being a female artist today. They say females have “less ticket and merch sales, less radio play, less impact on a wider audience”. The only way to combat this is to constantly be putting out the best music I possibly can, keeping people interested and sharing my content, and engaging with my fans on a personal level, which I will continue to do.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>Some people just can't contribute financially, and I understand! But here are some other ways to help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make some NOISE about my campaign!! Use the Indiegogo share tools to share with friends and family via email and/or social media</li>
<li>PRAY. Lift this campaign up in your time with God and ask Him for His will to be done!</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This project was done mainly to help Folktek Mescaline semimodular synth integrate better with eurorack format. </p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/343938840?portrait=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p><strong>Some (not all) uses with Folktek Mescaline:</strong></p>
<p>1. Send envelopes to Channel for full control (envelope into Key) of the unit. Also allows for much shorter sounds. Chords, or melodies - now fully sequencable.</p>
<p>2. Send gates and trigs directly into Mental - sometimes you don't want to mess with motion too much.</p>
<p>3. Send trigs from motion to your eurorack - sometimes you want motion to be the main sequencer.</p>
<p>4. Add &amp; Remove Motion pulses now can be tied to joystick or manual gate, or sequenced. </p>
<p>And many, many more. </p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>Why is it so pricy for passive format converter?</strong></p>
<p>I do not do it by hand - I hired professional company to design &amp; produce the unit. They have their own markup on this. It looks decent enough and aesthetics take part of the price too. Getting it from 8 hp to 6 hp turned out to be a bit more $. Add taxes (18% from profit, 23% VAT), packaging, time spent to pack &amp; send everything and suddenly the initial price doubles T_T.</p>
<p><strong>Why unipolar?</strong></p>
<p>Because it covers 90% of cases, and makes it cheaper.</p>

<h3>dSteven's First Album!</h3>
<p>I’m very excited to announce that I have released my first full album and have also released the very first single on the radio called “Turning Me On” which is now climbing the Independent charts! My music has gotten the attention of artists such as the Queen of Soul, the late great Aretha Franklin. We were on the verge of working together before her advancing illness and other responsibilities took priority. I was a part of the national recording artist 7 Sons of Soul on the Verity/Zomba Gospel label and have shared the stage with many artists and written music on various projects.</p>
<p>I’m doing an Indiegogo campaign to meet the costs of this project, including my first video for “Turning Me On”. This means you can be a part of this exciting experience. If you choose to contribute you'll receive the album and you can take part of various reward options such as autographed pictures, t-shirts and stainless steel water bottles, opportunities for me to perform at your next event and more! I hope that you will consider supporting me and I appreciate you in advance.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will be integral in the success of this album and the singles that are released. There are many costs associated with producing this album such as:</p>
<p>Recording costs which include studio time, engineers, musicians, mixing and mastering</p>
<p>Promotional costs such as radio, press release newswire services, print and internet campaigns</p>
<p>Photo/video shoots</p>
<p>All of this will costs between $7,500-$10,000 and I have already invested approximately $5,000.</p>

<p>Music of My Soul Album</p>
<p>I am so moved to be writing this – my 25th anniversary of musical performances that included some of the best stages in the world (details below)</p>
<p>This anniversary was celebrated in a two-concert series in Miami Beach (The Fillmore Miami Beach at Jackie Gleason Theater for 2500 sold-out show) and Los Angeles (Saban Theater in Beverly Hills for 2400 sold-out show) and now is the moment to commemorate my music in an anniversary album, titled Music of My Soul. </p>
<p>Just like the name suggests, this album is very dear to my heart and soul, it is a combination of everything that I love about music, all the genres I have composed in and performed; jazz, soul, pop, Latin music, French music, and European music in both instrumentals and with lyrics. Every song on this album is a mix of who I am. </p>
<p>I hope you love listening to the songs, as much as I loved composing and writing, and, of course, performing them. </p>
<p>By taking a part in this album, you become my co-creator for every step of the way. Your name will be in the album, and your support of the recording and production of this milestone in my career, will last forever, for as long as there’s music listeners. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The 10 songs in the album are handpicked and will be crafted to perfection with your help. </p>
<p>Please see some of the talented artists you will be co-creating this album with:</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hey everyone! My name is James Carter, and I am a singer, song writer, producer &amp; pianist based in Sydney, Australia! My story is a bit different... I didn't start leaning piano until I was 17 so I had some serious catch up to do! I left school with a dream and a vision to create soulful music and 2018 to make that dream a reality. I have dedictaed the last 10 years of my life to reaching the point in my career where I am ready to record.

<p>I am excited to take you on this crazy but beautiful journey with me. Recently I have been working away &amp; am currently working on my orginial 5 track EP, that's at the refining point of arrangement and lyrics! The sound is a mixture between Pop and rock with elements from the late 60's to 70's. My inspiration draws from the likes of Ray Charles, The Rolling Stones, INXS, Elton John, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie and Pink Floyd. </p>
<p>It is a collaboration where I will been working with top producers/co-writers and I am so stocked to be at this stage. They are super close to being ready to record &amp; this is where this campaign will hopefully help me change my life. I would love to share some of these tracks with you &amp; chat with you all of the meaning and stories behind the lyrics and music. </p>

Billy and Juliet and we go by the name <em><strong><em><em><em><em>memoryfield</em></em></em></em></strong></em>. We've been
writing, recording, and performing music since we were teenagers and, as a duo, since 1992.  We've lived and worked in very diverse places such as the ""Live Music Capital of the World"" Austin, Texas,
and beautiful Missoula, Montana.  Now, we're based in Provo, Utah, with towering mountains in our backyard.  </p><p><strong>What do we sound like?</strong></p><p>Rock, hard rock,
progressive mood-rock, folky, jazzy... these are just a few of the labels and
genres that have been used to describe our sound over the years. We're cool with that, because we've been inspired by so many different musical sounds and artistic legends.  In addition
to our original material, we've covered The Who, David Bowie, The Smiths,
The Sundays... just to name a few.  Even ""Dream On"" by
Aerosmith.  We don't limit ourselves just to fit neatly into musical
""boxes"".  We write and record in ways that inspire and challenge us,
always trying to stay a step ahead of where we were yesterday.  </p><p>Here is what we look and sound like in 2015:</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FeLcChYnHAlc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DeLcChYnHAlc&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FeLcChYnHAlc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><em>Thank you

In 2013 we formed a partnership with DJ Harrison, the prodigiously talented producer and multi-instrumentalist based in Richmond, VA. Since then we have organized and embarked on six short west coast tours, stretching from Los Angeles to Seattle. Over the course of these tours DJ Harrison has performed at Boiler Room, Delicious Vinyl, Beat Cinema, Brick and Mortar, The Honey Hive Gallery and Stop Biting. In addition to these concerts he has appeared on the critically acclaimed Soulection, opened up for the legendary DJ Shadow, and performed at a Stones Throw Records event at SXSW in 2015, all while releasing numerous stellar mixtapes and albums. </p><p>While six tours in three years is no small feat, we believe that DJ Harrison needs to be on the west coast more frequently so we can continue to expand his fanbase in this specific region of the country. Six short tours spread over three years is not enough to accomplish that goal. Therefore, I have decided to ask you for your support so we can organize and execute three DJ Harrison tours in 2016 on the west coast. </p><p>We are not alone in thinking that he needs to be out here more often. Indeed, many of you have sent Denali West Coast several emails and messages, wondering when he would return. Some of you has also asked when he would be coming to your city, and not just Los Angeles, San Francisco or Seattle.

In 2013 we formed a partnership with DJ Harrison, the prodigiously talented producer and multi-instrumentalist based in Richmond, VA. Since then we have organized and embarked on six short west coast tours, stretching from Los Angeles to Seattle. Over the course of these tours DJ Harrison has performed at Boiler Room, Delicious Vinyl, Beat Cinema, Brick and Mortar, The Honey Hive Gallery and Stop Biting. In addition to these concerts he has appeared on the critically acclaimed Soulection, opened up for the legendary DJ Shadow, and performed at a Stones Throw Records event at SXSW in 2015, all while releasing numerous stellar mixtapes and albums. While six tours in three years is no small feat, we believe that DJ Harrison needs to be on the west coast more frequently so we can continue to expand his fanbase in this specific region of the country. Six short tours spread over three years is not enough to accomplish that goal. Therefore, I have decided to ask you for your support so we can organize and execute three DJ Harrison tours in 2016 on the west coast. We are not alone in thinking that he needs to be out here more often. Indeed, many of you have sent Denali West Coast several emails and messages, wondering when he would return. Some of you has also asked when he would be coming to your city, and not just Los Angeles, San Francisco or Seattle. Your support will enable us to continue to book shows in our old stomping grounds while allowing us to expand to new cities, such as San Diego, Sacramento, Eugene, Portland and Bellingham. In addition to performing in new cities, your support will help us create longer tours that provide you and your friends with even more opportunities to catch DJ Harrison live.All of the funds that we raise will go towards the operating costs of touring : airfare , gas , car rentals, the occasional hotel room or airbnb, food and new merchandise.

<h3>Us &amp; The Project</h3>
<p>We are a family of friends who loves to worship Jesus, and have a deep passion for writing the songs that shape the next generations of believers. All we do is for the purpose of spreading a culture of worship that is based on honesty, truth, and family to our country and BEYOND.<br/><br/>What you can help us with, is the BEYOND part.<br/>We released three norwegian worship songs earlier this year, but now we feel is the right time to release in english, which has been our main focus and dream all along.<br/>The whole Expect Rain team of writers all write mainly in english, so this is natural for all of us.</p>
<p>With your contribution, you will help us produce, release and distribute our single ""Clouds/Veil,""<br/>which will be a spring board for upcoming releases from us.<br/>A full english worship album is our goal, and this would help us to do exactly that later.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where The Money Goes</h3>
<p>We need approximately 2.000€ to do this project, and this is the specific things<br/>that need to get payed for, in the order in which it is prioritized:</p>

<li>Renting a Drummer.</li>
<li>Mastering &amp; Distribution of the song. (Spotify, iTunes and more...)</li>
<li>Cover Photo. (Picture used is not the cover photo.)</li>

<h3>Stinas visor</h3>
<p>Visbandet Stinas visor består av Stina Klintbom - sång, Magnus Markling - mandolin, kör och tin whistle, Andreas Nordanstig - gitarrer, kör, Johan Bengtsson - kontrabas och Hanna Austern - fiol, kör. Bandet fick ett första genomslag 2010 med <i>Tågresa</i> som vann tävlingen <i>Svensktoppen nästa</i> i P4 Göteborg. 2014 kom debutalbumet <i>När jag mötte dig</i> med en titellåt som blev populär i bröllopssammanhang. Sedan dess har bandet utvecklats mycket både som musiker och inom låtskrivande. Det har varit riktigt härligt att spela in de nya låtarna till albumet <i>Medan bäcken brusar </i>och nu har vi under ett års tid tillsammans med vår producent finslipat det hela till något vi är riktigt stolta över!</p>
<p>Här kan ni höra ett smakprov på singeln Du lever ännu: <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/0KB4hTwPspGHeOCCUZ0uqP?si=V51iNaYVQRWK7MvJt7k1jQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://open.spotify.com/track/0KB4hTwPspGHeOCC...</a></p>
<p>Att driva ett visband är långt ifrån vinstdrivande. För att få det hela att gå runt krävs det att bandmedlemmarna lägger mycket fritid för ibland nästan inget gage. Därför har det varit tajt att få ihop budgeten till detta projekt.  För att kunna ro albumet i hamn hoppas vi därför att ni kan hjälpa oss med ett ekonomiskt bidrag. Ett stipendium från Ale kommun hjälpte oss att betala en liten del av inspelningskostnaderna, men det är långt ifrån det enda som kostar. Vi skulle bli väldigt tacksamma om ni ville hjälpa oss med det sista steget i albumprocessen – att trycka upp en CD!</p>
<p>Mastringskostnader: 4000 kr<br/>Uppläggningsavgift digital distribution: 1000 kr <br/>Tryckkostnader fysisk CD: 8100 kr</p>

(compatible with iPhone, iPad and iPod touch) will be a virtual playground for you to explore, discover and learn about music with the help of a piano, a fretted instrument (guitar / bass) and a playable staff. All of this in one single app!</span><br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Customize Instruments:</b> Change the number of keys of the piano, the number of strings (4 to 8), sound and tuning of the fretted instrument, and the clef (Bass, Alto, Tenor, Treble) of the staff. Tweak them to meet your needs.</li>
<li>
<b>From Basic to Advanced:</b> Whether you are a beginner, a music student or a pro, Musical! will be a valuable tool at your disposal. From simple note positions to chords derived from a certain mode of a scale, you can dive freely through the vast sea of Musical! knowledge.</li>
<li>
<b>Grammatically Correct:</b> You'll get accurate and grammatically correct information about intervals, scales and chords. i.e. When finding an interval, say an<i> Ascending Augmented Sixth</i> from C, Musical! will give you a A# rather than Bb.

<p>One big challenge would be the distribution of the app. Finding a way to smoothly deliver it to you, awesome backers, has proven to be somewhat of a headache for other app crowdfunding campaigns, big and small.

<p><br/></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
</div></div>","Musical! (compatible with iPhone, iPad and iPod touch) will be a virtual playground for you to explore, discover and learn about music with the help of a piano, a fretted instrument (guitar / bass) and a playable staff. All of this in one single app!


Key features:


Customize Instruments: Change the number of keys of the piano, the number of strings (4 to 8), sound and tuning of the fretted instrument, and the clef (Bass, Alto, Tenor, Treble) of the staff. Tweak them to meet your needs.

From Basic to Advanced: Whether you are a beginner, a music student or a pro, Musical! will be a valuable tool at your disposal. From simple note positions to chords derived from a certain mode of a scale, you can dive freely through the vast sea of Musical! knowledge.

Grammatically Correct: You'll get accurate and grammatically correct information about intervals, scales and chords. i.e. When finding an interval, say an Ascending Augmented Sixth from C, Musical! will give you a A# rather than Bb. If you want to find a Ascending Minor Seventh however, Bb will be the answer.

Beyond the Conventional: Curious to learn more about obscure notes like B# or Fb? What about Double-Sharps or Double-Flats? Do they even exist? Well, this little app's got you covered!

Go deep and find information about:


Note: Solfège name, enharmonics, accidentals and octaves.

Interval: Enharmonic intervals, distance (in Whole and Half Steps) and inversions.

Scale: Alternate names, modes and chords derived from the scale.

Chord: Alternate spellings, positions and inversions.

You can also just have fun and play with your favorite instrument!

<h3>Why and What is Projection Powder?</h3>
<p>Projection Powder is Project Paperclip's 2nd album, and is the 6th volume of the Malkhut Series. It is a concept album about Edward Kelley, John Dee and the House of the Donkey in the Cradle. Fusing Enochian, Post-Punk and Moravian Folk, this album represents a new genre of musick... Geomantick Tribal Punk. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The recordings are finished and we will mix and master the 13 tracks very soon. I have already paid for this entire album myself, so the only thing that needs funding is the Vinyl. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What I thought was a finished product back in 2013 morphed into a new genre about 1 year ago when I brought Karel Holas and Iva Marešová on board to help me finish the project. Two of the absolute finest Czech musicians mixed with the founding guitarist from P.I.L. and the drummer from Prong, and the rest of us ugly mugs!!! The tracks sound absolutely amazing, and I am excited for the World to finally be able to hear this Musick... 93</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Eugene Kaminsky, librettist and poet, and I, Nissim Khalifa, composer of symphonic music, met during our master's degree studies in composition, and have been collaborating ever since.</p>
<p>We would like to introduce our never-before produced, Irish-myth-based opera! A dream Nissim had envisioned for a long time, almost 20 years.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last two years this dream has finally become a reality — a fully composed and orchestrated opera of Fionn Mc'Cool!</p>
<p>The opera draws inspiration from traditional Irish music, especially Sean-nós, creating a novel combination between the opera genre and Irish tradition and folklore. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The entire sum will be invested to have a fully staged performance that will require:</p>
<p>- Performers: soloists, choir, and orchestra.</p>
<p>- Behind the scenes: Director, Producer, Costumes, stage crew and set, audio and video recording.</p>
<p>- Public relations: ads etc.</p>
<p>Be sure to view our perks that start from a special thank you, audio and/or video recording, signed copies of the opera's full score, and goes up to a ticket to the opera premiere!!</p>
<p>One special perk is already reserved for JIM FITZPATRICK for allowing us to use his amazing illustrations in all of our campaign videos :)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As artists, we find universal beauty and qualities in the Irish national ethos, which, together with the novel adaption of the story as an opera plot, have an UNPRECEDENTED POTENTIAL for a mutual enrichment between Irish culture and the Opera genre!</p>
<p>The opera is the fruit of two years of our collaborative labor — moving back and forth from composition to writing, where at times, the music inspired the writing and at other times, the writing inspired the music.</p>
<p>During this process, we recruited many talented opera singers dedicated to the cause, who invested hours in recording demos in Nissim's home studio :)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We would like to have the opera up and running within a short period of time, while maintaining a high level of execution. Some challenges may come up along the way: </p>
<p>How do we present Aillen (the creature) in a frightening manner and make him BLOW FIRE OUT OF HIS MOUTH?! :) We have some ideas for that. Stay tuned for updates, and maybe offer a solution of your own!</p>
<p>Designing the set so it will show Fionn's journey throughout the opera in a believable manner and at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p>If some shortage in funds should arise during production due to unexpected events and/or setbacks — we will make sure to remain within budget by finding a way to cut back on the costs of one of the production aspects. </p>

<p><b>OUR UNDYING DREAM </b></p>
<p>Our dream, like most musicians, is to have our music heard and loved by our fans, and to travel the county and the world sharing it. Since our drummer Jesse passed, members came and went, each not quite fitting. Over the last year, we found the right mix and started recording our second album, our drive and determination ever growing. This past October, we acquired a manager who quickly brought an exceptional agent, with impressive connections, on board and things began to really take off for us. We are now at the juncture where we need to wrap up our album and finalize the details of the tour our manager and agent are putting together for us. We are blessed to have this once in a life-time opportunity and need your help to see it through. If we are unable to acquire funds, we will have to delay, postpone or potentially cancel. Our fans are our family, and we want you as our newest member! We all firmly believe that if it is not fun, we have no reason to do this, so jump on board and have the best time ever with us.</p>
<p><strong>YOU</strong></p>
<p>Your contributions will change our undying dream into a living, breathing reality.  Working extremely hard has brought us as far as we are able to go on our own. We are privileged to have an opportunity that very few other professional musicians will ever see; YOU will make the difference! By supporting us, you will make it possible for us to share our music with you and thousands of people all over the world, and have a lot of creepy good fun while we are at it. In a world that is often plagued by thoughts of boredom or commonality, help us be the exception. Let us entertain you!</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HELP WE NEED FROM YOU</strong></p>
<p>Completing our second album and going on a national tour is a massive project, we are just your everyday working class (yet luckily talented) guys shooting for the stars. We need your help to see this through. Be assured that we are personally continuing to diligently work on our projects and to generate and save all we can to promote our future. Creep is in need of funding for CD production and mastering. We have recorded and mixed the album on our own up to this point, but need the pros to step in for the final touches. As you can see from our video and photos, we have a very unique look and our staging goes right along with it. Since we have been at this for some time we are in need of some new equipment and props to give you, and our fans, what they expect from Creep...a magnificent show! Getting to and from our tour dates is a challenge when we haul all of our gear with us.  To make traveling make sense, we need an enclosed trailer so that the band members will all be in one vehicle and the gear will be safely with us as well. Our instruments are our livelihood. It also just makes sense economically. Playing in different cities throughout the weeks leaves us in hotels and on the road more often than not, and that can be costly enough that touring is not a wise option. We need your help supplementing our travel fund. And lastly, we need your generosity offsetting the cost of designing, producing, and purchasing merchandise for you and our fans.  Merch, as it's called, is the one reliable generator of revenue for bands that are trying to get their careers off of the ground. If we do not have it, we cannot sell it to you and our fans. We need to design and buy merch representing our new record and the upcoming tour. Whew! That sounds like a whole lot of stuff we need, but actually we have thrown in every dime we have to get to this point, and these requests are the bare necessities. If we are unable to reach our campaign goal, any funds received will still go directly to the above mentioned requests, but let's hope that we hit that goal and then some. WE WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU!!</p>
<p>CD production/mastering $1500</p>
<p>Touring expenses $2000</p>
<p>Trailer $3000</p>
<p>Staging/equipment $1500</p>
<p>Merch $2000</p>
<p><b>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?</b></p>
<p>Creep will never ask for anything for free, we just need a hand up. We have lots of rewards to offer to you for your contributions. Your rewards include everything from stickers, to drum stix, to CDs both hard copy and digital, a 36x24 poster, to t-shirts, glow hoodies, and combinations of all sorts of wonderfully creepy things. We also have a Secret Perk if you are so inclined to fund us $300.00... extra Creepy things await! If you are interested in helping Creep fulfill our dream while entertaining you, but you just do not have the money to donate, no worries! There are other ways you can help out. We will be offering rewards to those of you that refer our campaign to your friends and contacts on your social media accounts. **Make sure you use the INDIEGOGO SHARE TOOLS so that analytics can keep track of your referrals. </p>
<p><b>LASTLY</b></p>
<p><b>THANK YOU, SO MUCH!!  </b>Thank you for taking your precious time to read about Creep.  Thank you for your generosity. Thank you for helping us take advantage of a once in a life-time opportunity. And thank you for choosing to help us realize our undying dream of sharing our music with the world!</p>

Your contributions will change our undying dream into a living, breathing reality.  Working extremely hard has brought us as far as we are able to go on our own. We are privileged to have an opportunity that very few other professional musicians will ever see; YOU will make the difference! By supporting us, you will make it possible for us to share our music with you and thousands of people all over the world, and have a lot of creepy good fun while we are at it. In a world that is often plagued by thoughts of boredom or commonality, help us be the exception. Let us entertain you!
WHAT HELP WE NEED FROM YOU
Completing our second album and going on a national tour is a massive project, we are just your everyday working class (yet luckily talented) guys shooting for the stars. We need your help to see this through. Be assured that we are personally continuing to diligently work on our projects and to generate and save all we can to promote our future. Creep is in need of funding for CD production and mastering. We have recorded and mixed the album on our own up to this point, but need the pros to step in for the final touches. As you can see from our video and photos, we have a very unique look and our staging goes right along with it. Since we have been at this for some time we are in need of some new equipment and props to give you, and our fans, what they expect from Creep...a magnificent show! Getting to and from our tour dates is a challenge when we haul all of our gear with us.  To make traveling make sense, we need an enclosed trailer so that the band members will all be in one vehicle and the gear will be safely with us as well. Our instruments are our livelihood. It also just makes sense economically. Playing in different cities throughout the weeks leaves us in hotels and on the road more often than not, and that can be costly enough that touring is not a wise option. We need your help supplementing our travel fund. And lastly, we need your generosity offsetting the cost of designing, producing, and purchasing merchandise for you and our fans.  Merch, as it's called, is the one reliable generator of revenue for bands that are trying to get their careers off of the ground. If we do not have it, we cannot sell it to you and our fans. We need to design and buy merch representing our new record and the upcoming tour. Whew! That sounds like a whole lot of stuff we need, but actually we have thrown in every dime we have to get to this point, and these requests are the bare necessities. If we are unable to reach our campaign goal, any funds received will still go directly to the above mentioned requests, but let's hope that we hit that goal and then some. WE WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU!!
CD production/mastering $1500
Touring expenses $2000
Trailer $3000
Staging/equipment $1500
Merch $2000
WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?
Creep will never ask for anything for free, we just need a hand up. We have lots of rewards to offer to you for your contributions. Your rewards include everything from stickers, to drum stix, to CDs both hard copy and digital, a 36x24 poster, to t-shirts, glow hoodies, and combinations of all sorts of wonderfully creepy things. We also have a Secret Perk if you are so inclined to fund us $300.00... extra Creepy things await! If you are interested in helping Creep fulfill our dream while entertaining you, but you just do not have the money to donate, no worries! There are other ways you can help out. We will be offering rewards to those of you that refer our campaign to your friends and contacts on your social media accounts. **Make sure you use the INDIEGOGO SHARE TOOLS so that analytics can keep track of your referrals. 
LASTLY
THANK YOU, SO MUCH!!  Thank you for taking your precious time to read about Creep.  Thank you for your generosity. Thank you for helping us take advantage of a once in a life-time opportunity. And thank you for choosing to help us realize our undying dream of sharing our music with the world!
Respectfully,
CREEP

<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>I’m Evelyn, and I was born to imagine &amp; create. It’s instinctual for me.  After graduating college, I now have the freedom and headspace to reinvite art into my life, and I finally feel at home in myself (!!). In the last six months, I’ve written over 15 songs, created a YouTube channel for sharing covers, and, inspired by the six-word story, I just released a micro-EP using my very basic tech.</p>
<p>They say necessity is the mother of invention, which has been a big mood for me this season. On New Year’s Eve, I boarded a plane to the UK with just a backpack &amp; a suitcase and had to leave my instruments behind. I’ve been recording music on my iPad mini, using the lil earbuds as a microphone, and creating backing tracks from scratch with GarageBand. While it’s been a fun challenge to work with limited resources, I’m really excited to see what I can do with access to proper equipment. </p>

<p>I’m shooting for $2300 to cover basic costs of instrument rental, recording, and production consultation. Also I’m turning 23, and it seems reasonable to fundraise 100 bucks for every year I’ve been alive. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p>CAMPAGNE de FINANCEMENT -DAVIDSPOUTNIK 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bonjour à tous.</p>
<p>Au printemps 2017 j'ai lancé mon premier album de musique instrumentale, Davidspoutnik -Projet Matador (disponible sur Bandcamp: <a href=""https://davidspoutnik.bandcamp.com/album/projet-matador"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://davidspoutnik.bandcamp.com/album/projet-matador</a>)</p>
<p>Ce fut un des défis que je me suis lancé jusqu'ici qui m'aura rendu le plus fier: Produire un album en entier sur lequel j'ai joué de tous les instruments et où j'ai aussi enfilé successivement les chapeaux de compositeur, arrangeur, preneur de son, mixeur, etc.</p>
<p>Depuis, je suis revenu tout doucement à l'écriture de chansons, d'une part, et parallèlement à mes collaborations avec d'autres artistes, (dont le magnifique album de Lisbonne Télégramme lancé en 2019), j'ai décidé de m'atteler à un deuxième opus sous la bannière Davidspoutnik. Cette fois, j'ai envie d'amener ma recherche un peu plus loin et de m'entourer de musiciens avec qui je pourrai collaborer pour les arrangements et le travail de studio. Voilà.</p>
<p>Comme vous le savez sans doute, il est devenu de plus en plus difficile pour les  artisans de la musique de trouver le financement nécessaire à la réalisation de leurs projets de création. Les plus durement touchés par cette situation sont bien sûr les artistes eux-mêmes, les créateurs de contenu original, qui ne trouvent plus de partenaire financier comme par le passé et qui dans le contexte actuel ne reçoivent plus vraiment leur part du gâteau. Pendant que plusieurs intervenants de l'industrie en sont à essayer de comprendre le phénomène et à chercher des solutions, beaucoup d'artistes se tournent vers le socio-financement. Par le biais des réseaux sociaux aussi bien que par le bouche à oreille, le défi est de rejoindre le plus de gens possible pour réussir à amasser les quelques centaines de dollars qui permettront à l'artiste de réaliser son projet.</p>
<p>Voilà donc la raison qui m'amène aujourd'hui à solliciter votre aide. Pour arriver à mener à terme la réalisation de mon deuxième album instrumental, il me faut recueillir la somme nécessaire pour payer les musiciens invités et pour engager des techniciens pour le mixage et le mastering final. Je me suis fixé un objectif de 6000 dollars. Avec ce coup de pouce, je devrais arriver à produire les 12 pièces prévues pour l'album.</p>
<p>La sortie de l'album est prévue pour septembre 2020.</p>
<p>Donc, à vos chéquiers, vos tablettes, vos ordinateurs ! Votre contribution vous assure d'obtenir l'album en version numérique de DAVIDSPOUTNIK, tome 2, ainsi que ma reconnaissance éternelle.</p>
<p>Bien que le succès de l'entreprise ne repose pas entièrement sur vos épaules, soyez assurés que votre contribution fera une ÉNORME différence.</p>

<h2><strong>Hallo Philippe hier! </strong></h2>
<p><u>(ENGLISH VERSION BELOW)</u></p>
<p><br/>Einige von euch kennen mich durch <strong>meine instrumentalen Soloalben</strong> oder vielleicht als<strong> Lehrer am MGI</strong> ...</p>
<p>Hiermit möchte ich Euch einladen, Teil meines <strong>neuem akustischen Soloalbum-Projekts zu sein</strong>.</p>
<p>Ich bin gerade in der letzten Phase der Fertigstellung des Albums und freue mich sehr, Euch in dieses Album einzubeziehen. Es ist eine neue Erfahrung und Möglichkeit meine Musik zu teilen. Ich bin sehr gespannt... :))</p>
<p>Mit meinem neuen Album möchte ich Jahrzehnte meiner Musik in einem Album erklingen lassen. Bedeutet, ich habe einige meiner ""Best of"" -Songs aus der Vergangenheit genommen, komplett neu arrangiert (nur Akustikgitarre) und mit weiteren Songs aus meinen letzten Jazz / Fusion-Einflüssen hinzugefügt.</p>
<p>Ich habe mit dem Album im August 2019 angefangen. Die ersten Musiker hören meine Musik und fügen ihren musikalischen ""Fußabdruck"" in das Album ... Ein Update über die Musiker wird bald folgen ...</p>
<p><strong>Warum über Crowdfunding?</strong></p>
<p>Der Grund ist sehr einfach: <strong>Ich möchte mit diesem Projekt unabhängig sein</strong> und Crowdfunding ist eine Möglichkeit, Musik so zu machen, wie ich es schon immer machen wollte + Menschen einzubeziehen, die meine Musik unterstützen möchten.</p>
<p>Es ist jetzt mein 8. Soloalbum und ich bin sehr gespannt auf das Ergebnis. Die gesamten Kompositionen, Arrangements, das Gitarrenspiel, das Mischen und das Neuarrangieren werden von mir in meinem Studio in Münster durchgeführt.</p>
<p><strong>Was ich brauche:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mittel für Musiker, das Drücken von CDs, Kunstwerken, das Mischen, Merchandising usw.</li>
<li>Ihr könnte dazu einfach eines  der angebotenen Pakete z.B. Download Link des neuen Albums, physische CD, signierte CD oder eine 60min. Skype Session mit mir buchen. (weitere Details auf der rechten Seite aufgelistet)</li>
<li>Alternativ könnt ihr einfach über den <strong>Button ""Back it""</strong> einen EUR Betrag spenden (die Beträge werden rein für das Album verwendet).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Das bekommt ihr:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Das neue Album und Pre-Access zum Download</li>
<li>Merchandising-Artikel</li>
<li>Musik-Playbacks</li>
<li>Werden Sie Partner bei mir (Ihr Name steht auf dem Musikvideo)</li>

<h3>We are Thanks for Leaving</h3>
<p>In 2011 we won the Gorilla Music Battle of the Bands in San Francisco. We recorded and released our debut, self titled album. Now, 5 years later we are ready to rerelease the album remixed and remastered by J7 Studios. This album was historic to the Half Moon Bay music scene and deserves to be heard in high quality audio.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Remixing, Remastering and Pressing</h3>
<p>We need $2,000 to cover the costs of remixing and remastering the album as well as pressing physical copies and getting digital distribution on iTunes and Spotify. In order to do this we are offering pre-sale copies to our fans to thank them for their contributions. These will include exclusive Thanks for Leaving 5th Anniversary commemorative posters.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>We are planning a comeback! We have new material written and are planning to record our second album. We have some shows in the works and this album will help us promote our music and allows us to explore new avenues and venues. It is VERY important that we have music in the highest quality when we shop it to labels and promoters so it is essential that our fans support this release.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Quality Ain't Cheap</h3>

</div></div>","We are Thanks for Leaving
In 2011 we won the Gorilla Music Battle of the Bands in San Francisco. We recorded and released our debut, self titled album. Now, 5 years later we are ready to rerelease the album remixed and remastered by J7 Studios. This album was historic to the Half Moon Bay music scene and deserves to be heard in high quality audio.

Remixing, Remastering and Pressing
We need $2,000 to cover the costs of remixing and remastering the album as well as pressing physical copies and getting digital distribution on iTunes and Spotify. In order to do this we are offering pre-sale copies to our fans to thank them for their contributions. These will include exclusive Thanks for Leaving 5th Anniversary commemorative posters.

The Future
We are planning a comeback! We have new material written and are planning to record our second album. We have some shows in the works and this album will help us promote our music and allows us to explore new avenues and venues. It is VERY important that we have music in the highest quality when we shop it to labels and promoters so it is essential that our fans support this release.

Quality Ain't Cheap
Over the past years things have changed quite a bit. Some of us have started families, others have joined the workforce and started paying that dreaded Bay Area rent. We just can't afford to release this album out of pocket. We beckon our fans to band together on this with us to make this happen and keep the legacy alive. Your contributions do much more than fund an album. They mean more shows, more new music, better quality and bigger opportunities. In short your contributions are the future of TFL.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't afford to make a contribution it's okay. We still love ya. You can still help our cause by sharing our campaign. Telling your friends, posting our videos and our songs and most importantly coming to our shows.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, we are here to seek support from the lovely people around the country India and abroad. <a href=""http://www.thebodhisattwatrio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Bodhisattwa Trio</a> is a Jazz influenced rock project which started as a platform for sharing life's experiences of each of the members through music. The band has gained their fame after their first Europe tour post their first album 'Intersection's release. The second album <a href=""http://amuzerecords.in/product/heart-of-darkness/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Heart of Darkness</a>, that was released last year, was ranked by Rolling Stone as one of the <a href=""http://rollingstoneindia.com/10-best-indian-albums/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">top 10 Indian releases in 2016</a> amongst other albums from varied genres.</p>
<p>This year the band got an invitation from Vilnius, Lithuania to play at the prestigious <a href=""http://www.vilniusmamajazz.lt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vilnius Mama Jazz Festival</a>. The only hinderance to their travel is that the organisers are not providing with any support to the band for the international travel. Hence we seek support from whoever is kind enough to help this talented and enthusiastic bunch to reach their deserved stage at Vilnius.</p>
<p>It is important for all of us to go and play at that festival as 'The Bodhisattwa Trio' represents contemporary Indian music apart from Indian classical &amp; traditional music for which we are famous. With the opportunity of this kind it will be a great occasion to showcase the modern contemporary Jazz music to the rest of the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Okay! Lets clearly break it down the exchange for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>To go to vilnius and come back we need $3500 which includes visa and international travel expenses for the entire band.</li>
<li>The festival stage is slated for the band on 17th November 2017. The band however will be traveling to Europe for the month from 20th October through 20th November 2017.</li>
<li>It would be obvious that you would get perks and they will come in digital copies/digital prints/bromide prints of exclusive band photos and an unreleased track remixed for this project exclusively.</li>
<li>If we can not reach our goal then that will bring us to an uncertainty about performing at VMJF. However, if we can not at all go there, all this fund will be spent in our album recording which is slated around February 2018.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This project is very important to us because for a band like us, getting an invitation to play at a festival of the stature of Vilnius Mama Jazz Fest is more than we can ask for. In other words, this festival is one of the top prestigious festivals of Europe where musicians like Chick Corea, Wayne Shorter, Brian Blade, John McLaughlin, Billy Cobham, John Scofield and many other veteran stars of the industry have performed.</li>
<li>This is also important because we wish to showcase the contemporary Indian music to the western world.</li>
<li>The future of playing avant-garde music lies in showcasing the craft to European audience. We feel that being able to play at this festival would help us more in terms of publicity and promotion in getting more shows in and around Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are many ways to help if you can not donate for the cause:</p>

A lot of hard work has actually been input into this very album to make sure that there is something in there for everybody.<br/> <br/>The album creation was motivated by the fact that I wanted to embark on a journey of my own since the record label I left had a different plan than mine concerning my career. The album is a foundation for my career in music, and what a foundation it is!<br/> <br/>This album was made possible by the tremendous support of people like Ball J, Papi, Brownberry, to mention a few. It has 12 songs and features artistes like Ball J, Cabum, Teephlow, Bantuma, K. Quan and G. West, with additional vocals by J Town; and producers like Prinx iPappi,Flying Lotus,Forcefields,Oisima and Cookin' Soul.<br/> <br/>The songs on the album are:<br/> <br/><ol>
<li> Intro</li>
<li>Random Thoughts</li>
<li>More Vim</li>
<li>Blowing</li>
<li>Mindstate</li>
<li>Stay feat. Bantuma</li>
<li>Word</li>
<li>Hold You feat. Bantuma</li>
<li>Zodiac</li>
<li>HipHopLives feat. Ball J<br/>
</li>
<li>Turn Up Teephlow x K.Quan x Drilix x G.West</li>
<li>Inferno feat. Cabum</li>
</ol>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>A total amount of $15,000 is needed to ensure the success of this project. This project involves radio, TV and online promotions with merchandise in mostly Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa and other countries.<br/>It also involves the shooting of music videos for almost all the tracks on the album (the video for 12. Inferno feat. Cabum has already been shot and released, and it is available on YouTube to watch).<br/>The total amount will be divided into 5 parts of $3,000 each of which 2.5 parts ($7,500)  will go to TV promotion since it entails the shooting of the videos, distribution of the videos to major TV stations and TV interviews.<br/>One part of the remaining ($3,000) will go into Radio Promotions which involves distribution to Dj's, Presenters and Producers, and radio interviews on most major radio stations in the mentioned countries.<br/>The remaining part ($4,500) will go into Online Promotions on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Google Ads; and Merchandise Production and distribution.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>My experiences as an Indie Hip Hop/Rap artist have made me realize that without proper Promotion Campaigns to push projects, they often die out at the doorstep of the studio and does not really go far as envisioned. This shows how vital Promotion Campaigns are to projects since they ensure that the projects get to the right audience conveniently as every good music is supposed to. Good music alone is not enough to ensure the success of projects without a massive push through promotions.<p>This is where I need your help in realizing my dream of getting my album heard by millions who yearn for good music.

</div></div>","Short SummaryHipHop Lives, being my first studio album, is something I have been planning for quite a while now and had to make sure I delivered something great for my fans and all hiphop lovers- actually a piece of myself. A lot of hard work has actually been input into this very album to make sure that there is something in there for everybody. The album creation was motivated by the fact that I wanted to embark on a journey of my own since the record label I left had a different plan than mine concerning my career. The album is a foundation for my career in music, and what a foundation it is! This album was made possible by the tremendous support of people like Ball J, Papi, Brownberry, to mention a few. It has 12 songs and features artistes like Ball J, Cabum, Teephlow, Bantuma, K. Quan and G. West, with additional vocals by J Town; and producers like Prinx iPappi,Flying Lotus,Forcefields,Oisima and Cookin' Soul. The songs on the album are: 
 Intro
Random Thoughts
More Vim
Blowing
Mindstate
Stay feat. Bantuma
Word
Hold You feat. Bantuma
Zodiac
HipHopLives feat. Ball J

Turn Up Teephlow x K.Quan x Drilix x G.West
Inferno feat. Cabum

  What We Need & What You GetA total amount of $15,000 is needed to ensure the success of this project. This project involves radio, TV and online promotions with merchandise in mostly Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa and other countries.It also involves the shooting of music videos for almost all the tracks on the album (the video for 12. Inferno feat. Cabum has already been shot and released, and it is available on YouTube to watch).The total amount will be divided into 5 parts of $3,000 each of which 2.5 parts ($7,500)  will go to TV promotion since it entails the shooting of the videos, distribution of the videos to major TV stations and TV interviews.One part of the remaining ($3,000) will go into Radio Promotions which involves distribution to Dj's, Presenters and Producers, and radio interviews on most major radio stations in the mentioned countries.The remaining part ($4,500) will go into Online Promotions on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Google Ads; and Merchandise Production and distribution.
  The ImpactMy experiences as an Indie Hip Hop/Rap artist have made me realize that without proper Promotion Campaigns to push projects, they often die out at the doorstep of the studio and does not really go far as envisioned. This shows how vital Promotion Campaigns are to projects since they ensure that the projects get to the right audience conveniently as every good music is supposed to. Good music alone is not enough to ensure the success of projects without a massive push through promotions.This is where I need your help in realizing my dream of getting my album heard by millions who yearn for good music. Your contributions will go a long way to ensuring that this album is a success by getting it heard by millions around the world.
My story is an inspiring one and so I put all of that into this album hoping to inspire young people around the world to never give up on their dreams no matter what.
This is my first crowdfunded project and I hope I hit the mark with this one. It really means a lot to me.    Risks & Challenges
This project is a challenging one since, as an Indie artist, I would have to monitor all the outlets I distribute to in order to make sure that they hold their part of the deal.
I have actually started putting together an effective management team to help me manage my career and the monitoring of the various outlets. Hopefully, this challenge will be controlled by my team and I.
  Other Ways You Can Help If you can not contribute in cash, you can definitely contribute in kind! No form of contribution is too small or unimportant to me. All forms of contribution are very much appreciated and welcome by me.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Academia Tradición Productions LLC and Caballota Records LLC have partnered on this project to raise the necessary funds to produce some great music.

Henríquez has a bachelor's degree in economics from Cornell University and a Master of International Affairs from Columbia University, and currently works full-time in the field of due diligence and investigations. Music has always been a true passion for Henríquez. Trained as a classical concert pianist, Henríquez developed juggled his academic and corporate life with a careful study of Latin music's harmonies, styles, and the techniques of its greatest exponents. After writing his first song as a junior at Cornell, Henríquez quickly became a promising songwriter, drawing his inspiration from his knowledge of Latin America's history, culture, politics, challenges, and his own personal experiences in the region.</p>

<p><strong>Genres:</strong> Timba, Salsa Shoke, Reggaetón, Bachata, Urbano</p>
<p>Caballota Records LLC was created when both co-founders of the label, Sergio Santizo and Ricardo Gutiérrez saw eye to eye the simple fact, that unfortunately the vast majority of Latin talent will be forever overshadowed in the music industry. Despite the accessibility of technology, Caballota believes that there is amazing talent out there that unfortunately will never reach its audience. Santizo and Gutiérrez are both Latinos of different backgrounds. Gutiérrez of Venezuelan/Colombian origin has been involved in the Latin Music scene all his life, including being a prominent DJ and Dancer in New Jersey. He has Latin music oozing out of his veins. Santizo, of Guatemalan decent grew up in Central NJ, a Rutgers University alum and with an MA in Public Policy, Law &amp; Economics from Universidad Complutence de Madrid and has been in sales in the financial industry and vast experience in global markets. There is no doubt that with all the passion that this duo has, Caballota Records is due to release Music from new talent for the entire world to enjoy.</p>

We hope you'll join us!What We Need & What You GetWe want to make this the best possible album it can be, so first and foremost, we're giving you the opportunity to pre-order the album and get your hands on it before the official release. There are also a myriad of other lovely perks, including your name in the album sleeve, a cover song of your choice (within reason!) given a Road Not Taken makeover, and even a concert in your very own living room, as well as lots of other little perks. Please check out of the rewards and get involved!The ImpactBy backing this campaign, you'll become a hugely important part of the release of the new album. Your support will mean that we can record the album in the studio that we want to use, get it properly mixed and mastered, and get actual CDs made and sent out to you.We're funding as much as we can ourselves, but we really need your support to make it as good as it can possibly be.Risks & ChallengesAs with any project, there is always the risk that it will run behind and be a little later than planned. We've set ourself strict deadlines in order to make sure it's ready for September, when we plan to go on tour, and we don't foresee a problem. But worst-case scenario is a delay, not a cancellation!Other Ways You Can HelpWe know that some people aren't in a position to contribute financially, but that doesn't mean they can't help. They can encourgage others to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign, share on social media and, if all else fails, we need tasty vegan recipes to sustain us in the studio.Thank You So Much!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The 5 songs that will be included on this EP have been in the works over the last year or so and I  have now reached the point where they are ready to be recorded with a full band and released! It has been a long process of writing and recording demos at home but I couldn't be more excited to finally get to the stage where I have a group of songs that are ready to be taken to the next level in the studio. Just to give you a quick taster, one of the tracks that will definitely be included on the EP is called 'We'll Catch the Sun' which took influence from a Noel Gallagher song called 'Alone on the Rope'.</p>
<p>When it comes writing songs, I tend to write my songs on an acoustic guitar and then build around them with a full band once I have a melody to work with. From there, I can add in different riffs and dynamics that all follow and work with the melody. The lyrics tend to be last part of the song for me because I like to see how the song is going before putting words to it. I feel like the music dictates what it is I want to write about once I know if the song is upbeat, sad, melancholy etc.</p>
<p>There are many bands and songwriters that have influenced my music, most notably Noel Gallagher and Richard Ashcroft. Both of these are very melodic in their writing and almost have a melancholy to them which has influenced the way I write. </p>
<p>All the songs on the EP touch on my own life experiences in some way or another. I try to do this as often as I can as I find it easier to tell a story about things I have experienced, however I try to keep them as open as I possibly can to other meanings. By this I mean so that people who listen can relate to the songs in their own particular way and put their own meanings to them.</p>
<p>I like to keep my music as simple as possible and let the melody stand out. I'm not one for ""shredding"" on the guitar and playing as quickly and loudly as possible (whilst I do still appreciate that), partly because I can't, but the main reason is melody.  I think this has come from a lot of the music that I listen to and my influences. </p>
<p>This for me is the beauty of music, how one song can mean something to one person and something completely different to another, while the songwriter knows the original meaning. Sometimes there doesn't even have to be a real meaning or story to a song and the songwriter themselves might not know what it means, but to someone who listens to it, it might mean the absolute world. This is why music, to me, is so fascinating.</p>
<p>All the songs will be recorded with a full band, not acoustic!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As I am sure you will know, recording any sort of music, wether a single or a full album, and then releasing it into the world is not cheap! I have self funded projects in the past but with this being a step up in size, I do need a little bit of help with this one, which is where you come in! All of the money I manage to raise through this crowdfunding campaign will be going towards studio costs as well as plenty of Merch! Everyone loves Merch!</p>
<p>The studio costs are where the main bulk of it will go as to record the EP will take around 5-6 days. On top of this are costs for the additional musicians required to help with the recording.</p>
<p>So as you would expect there are many different perks on offer that you can choose from! These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A free download of the EP for everyone</li>
<li>A signed physical copy of the EP (Without Being Where We Are Now, We Can't Be There)</li>
<li>Hand written, signed and framed lyrics</li>
<li>Signed Lyric and Photo Books</li>
<li>T-Shirts </li>
<li>Mugs (Because everyone needs a new mug)</li>
<li>Guitar Picks</li>
<li>Badges</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone who purchases a perk will also receive a personalised thank you email.</p>
<p>You can also keep up to date with the progress of the EP, on my YouTube Channel (search for Scott Edwards) as I will be Vlogging the whole process from start to finish. There will also be shoutouts on there to people who play a part by purchasing a perk!</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>As with anything, there are a couple of challenges with the project. But what is life without a good challenge? Everyone loves a good challenge otherwise it would be easy too easy to get what we want. We have to be able to take risks and challenge ourselves. I'm taking a big risk by trying to create a career in music for myself however I would much rather challenge myself and create something I am proud of and passionate about than to not try and never know if I would have been able to do it.</p>

<li>The recordings and the overall production of our album cost more than 4000 euros. So we need your help too to help us pay the studio rent, mixing and mastering as well as promoting it all across the world. </li>

<ul>
<li>I have been doing this in the past 12 years and Im learning a lot since, every day. How to open up, how to bring feelings and ideas to people. But I have found myself in blues&amp;gospel where I can express love, enjoyment, sorrow and enlightment. </li>
<li>I want to keep doing that and bring people much more closer. </li>

Music lovers from all across the world:

The recordings and the overall production of our album cost more than 4000 euros. So we need your help too to help us pay the studio rent, mixing and mastering as well as promoting it all across the world. 
We are all about giving! While you help us create music that everybody can enjoy, you also have the chance to get know our band and to know the album from a personal point of view!
If we dont reach our goal, all the money collected will go to the renting studio for mixing and mastering.


Connecting people across the world
We are not a telecommunication company but:

If you help us, we can travel more with the album and spread the joy and heartfelt emotions, which is one of the purposes of playin' music.
We have been playin' all across Europe as well as China and Africa. So many different cultures, but one thing is always the same:
When you look into the people's eyes you see there is the same light!!


Not Easy But Good Work
Living and making music is not an easy thing nowdays. Especially when you want to give people real emotions that they can truly relate to.

I have been doing this in the past 12 years and Im learning a lot since, every day. How to open up, how to bring feelings and ideas to people. But I have found myself in blues&gospel where I can express love, enjoyment, sorrow and enlightment. 
I want to keep doing that and bring people much more closer. 


Smile or Hug and Spread the Word
If you cannot contribute to our album, no problem:
In your daily life just give a smile to one another or hug somebody. It feels goood! :)
And if you feel so, come to one our shows and have fun or just share this page with your friends and family.Peace and Love! :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For the connoisseurs of the legendary British rock group QUEEN, rock artist <a href=""https://youtu.be/Z7pGnnxzQk4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VALENSIA</a> needs no introduction. When Valensia released his remarkable QUEEN TRIBUTE in 2003, he was hailed by the Queen Community, praised for his ability to perfectly recreate the Queen sound. His rendition of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rcJCIdOI6A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">My Fairy King</a> has been widely recognized as the only Queen cover which actually surpasses the original. The tribute was praised by Brian May, Eddie Howell (Man From Manhattan), Ian Hunter (Mott The Hoople) for the excellent performances and arrangements.</p>
<p><br/>In 2019, Valensia's record company requested a new Queen Tribute but a clash occurred when Valensia sought out only hidden, obscure and unfinished early Mercury songs, while the record company wanted the greatest hits. The QUEEN III album was halted. Which is what brings us here.</p>

<p><i>Queen in 1974</i></p>
<p><br/>Valensia's <a href=""https://youtu.be/a6h49_5VjRA?t=20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">voice</a> indeed is uncanningly similar to the voice of the young Freddie Mercury and, moreover, he has no trouble in perfectly duplicating <a href=""https://youtu.be/a6h49_5VjRA?t=170"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Brian May's style of guitar playing</a> or John Deacon's bass playing, nor Queen's <a href=""https://youtu.be/a6h49_5VjRA?t=196"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">inimitable harmony vocals</a>. However, Valensia's truly uncanny feature is the gift to compose and arrange in <a href=""https://youtu.be/6hfyvJ54lS0?t=104"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">exactly the similar style</a> Queen composed and arranged their music in the seventies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606313363/xurfrwfqtuqpb20tonuw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Valensia in 1993, alongside Queen, was one of the very few artists who achieved world-wide success by releasing a complex structured song (GAIA), with a total duration of nearly </i>six <i>minutes in  the fall of 1993.  Selling over 1 million copies, Valensia achieved superstardom in Japan at the age of 22.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why we're here</strong></h3>
<p>In 2019 Valensia's record company once again asked for a new Queen Tribute album. But instead of re-recording the greatest hits, Valensia went hunting for the most obscure material Freddie Mercury or any of the other Queen members had written but never released. <br/>Valensia started recording the Mercury-penned songs ""Green"", ""Vagabond Outcast"" and even the mysterious song ""F.E.W.A."", of which only parts of the lyrics survived.</p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606314240/lf1nevdeyhr9deeacqqa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Freddie Mercury's letter, mentioning the existence of the song ""F.E.W.A.""</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>By letting the lyrics dictate how the music might have been, Valensia suggestively reconstructed the unknown song ""F.E.W.A. (FEELINGS ENDED, WORN AWAY)"" and re-arranged songs like ""GREEN"", ""VAGABOND OUTCAST"", ""NEW YORK"" and even the John Glover Kind-penned ""(I DO LIKE TO BE) BESIDE THE SEASIDE"", all in the Queen 1974-1977 golden age style. Demos of the pre-Queen band SMILE were also included, such as ""STEP ON ME"" in a Killer Queen-styled of fashion, as well as Brian May's ""APRIL LADY"".</p>

<p><i>Valensia's 2019 rendition of Queen's ""We Are The Champions""</i></p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>Although Valensia recorded ""BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY"", ""WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS"" and ""SOMEBODY TO LOVE"", the album was canceled in early 2020 because of the lack of hit songs. <br/>Valensia added Aretha Franklin's ""MY PRECIOUS LORD"" as a ""SOMEBODY TO LOVE"" Queen-styled rendition and then halted the project due to the lack of funds, which brings us here: We want to see this album completed and be able to listen to the only artist on Earth who is able to revive the seventies Queen sound, with the actual never heard before Freddie Mercury written or related material.<br/> </p>

<p><i>Valensia commencing the recordings for QUEEN III</i></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As QUEEN fans know, the early Queen albums were meticulously crafted, taking months to record. The budgets for albums from the seventies until the early nineties were astonishing, even Valensia holds the record with his second album ""K.O.S.M.O.S."", costing over a quarter of a million euros. </p>
<p><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/wkhAlEKJPOA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<div><div><div><p><i>The VALENSIA Far East Tour 1996</i></p></div></div></div>
<p><br/>In the digital era, obviously it has become much cheaper to record albums, and with Valensia owning his own studio any album now can be completed for about ten to fifteen thousand euros, which is only the mixing and mastering of the album.</p>
<p><br/>This album will be called QUEEN III, as it literally revives the QUEEN II sound, using the most obscure, forgotten and barely audible recordings of a young Freddie Mercury and his bands ""IBEX"" and ""Wreckage"", or Brian May and Roger Taylor's pre-Queen band ""Smile"". <br/>This means the album will sound as if it could have been the follow-up album of QUEEN II; the era which most Queen fans love most.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>And for most Queen fans the thought of having an album filled with completely arranged songs, sounding like the early Queen AND mostly written by Queen, a very tantalizing thought. Especially knowing the sound of the harmony vocals, the daring, complex arrangements and the pompous productions of those days are a thing of the past. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606167033/oqkmnhuzw6lpqajfjntl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>The Queen III album sleeve</i></p>
<p><br/>Queen fans are well aware of Valensia's ability to breathe the authentic life into the songs, which makes this album a spine-chilling experience for anyone who is addicted to the seventies Queen sound: Valensia will repeat what he did in 2003 with his amazing Queen Tribute but now with unknown Queen songs. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenges aren't a factor: we all know Valensia is undoubtedly one of the most gifted and talented artists in this genre. The risk is not getting the funding to finish the production, meaning the mixing and mastering. Not reaching our target means we can't produce the album. Of course, with your support, we will be able to finish production of this masterpiece, which will be the most discussed Queen related music production when available.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help to get the word out and make some noise about the Queen III campaign by using the Indiegogo share tools.</p>
<p>We're counting on the support of the regal Queen fans to make this album a huge success! <br/>Promoting this campaign will be rewarded, as promotion is equally important as supporting this project! </p>
<p>We hope to be able to bring you an album which seems to have been made about 40 years ago, and the closest thing to the legendary rock band QUEEN.<br/>As close as it gets!</p>

Queen in 1974
Valensia's voice indeed is uncanningly similar to the voice of the young Freddie Mercury and, moreover, he has no trouble in perfectly duplicating Brian May's style of guitar playing or John Deacon's bass playing, nor Queen's inimitable harmony vocals.

<h3>The Hand Shake</h3>
<p>What's up friends and future friends! Welcome to my first crowdfunding campaign EVER! </p>
<p>My name is Tyler Alexis. I’m a singer/songwriter in Los Angeles, California, and I’m ready to record my debut album!</p>
<h3>Growing Up a Pale Child of the Sun...</h3>
<p>My mom said I was singing before I was talking. I remember dancing around my room, hairbrush in hand, pretending I was on stage performing in front of thousands of people. However, being from LA, I never wanted to be the cliché ""starving artist trying to make it big."" After incessantly searching to find an alternative career to music, I realized that I couldn't ignore my passion.</p>
<h3>The Tough Conversation...</h3>
<p>I’ve been writing songs for years. During college, I performed at coffee shops and open mics. However, I constantly found myself stuck in this musical ""Catch 22."" It wasn’t until about 2 ½ years ago, that I stopped allowing my excuses to keep me from moving forward musically. It was one of the most difficult conversations I’ve had with myself, but honestly, I'm so much happier now.</p>
<p>The more I allow this DIY musician life to consume me, the more insatiable I become. Over the last 2 ½ years, I have made leaps and bounds in my career. I have managed to form a band, recorded a single, performed at a multitude of venues in LA (including the famed Viper Room), performed internationally, created my own merch, and now recording my first album. Which brings me to why we’re here!</p>
<h3>The Album</h3>
<p>As a child of divorce and struggling with a learning disability, I turned to music as a way of healing and to express what I had difficulty putting into words. Now I hope that my music brings the same comfort and encouragement to others to persevere through their own hardships. I aspire to empower others through transparency, hard work, and music. This is why I decided to name my debut album <strong>INTREPID</strong>; which means fearless, adventurous, or ""very brave and willing to risk being in dangerous situations."" Intrepid encapsulates what life pushes and molds us to be. Most of the songs on this album, hash through some of my own life experiences that have shaped me into becoming more ""intrepid."" </p>
<p><strong>INTREPID</strong> features songs with a mix of topics and styles. ""Neglected,"" is a song about coming to terms with being mistreated and learning to put your own mental health first. ""Nightmares,"" is a song that details an incredibly difficult journey towards self-reliance. ""Black Coffee &amp; Cigarettes"" is a bluesy, fanciful scenario about a chance interaction in a coffee shop. ""Songbird"" is a light-hearted, lullaby. I've poured my heart and soul into these songs and I'm so excited to share them with you! This album has been 6 years in the making and I sincerely hope that you find the solace and inspiration to be more <strong>INTREPID</strong>. </p>

</div><h2>Let's do this!</h2></div>","The Hand Shake
What's up friends and future friends! Welcome to my first crowdfunding campaign EVER! 
My name is Tyler Alexis. I’m a singer/songwriter in Los Angeles, California, and I’m ready to record my debut album!
Growing Up a Pale Child of the Sun...
My mom said I was singing before I was talking. I remember dancing around my room, hairbrush in hand, pretending I was on stage performing in front of thousands of people. However, being from LA, I never wanted to be the cliché ""starving artist trying to make it big."" After incessantly searching to find an alternative career to music, I realized that I couldn't ignore my passion.
The Tough Conversation...
I’ve been writing songs for years. During college, I performed at coffee shops and open mics. However, I constantly found myself stuck in this musical ""Catch 22."" It wasn’t until about 2 ½ years ago, that I stopped allowing my excuses to keep me from moving forward musically. It was one of the most difficult conversations I’ve had with myself, but honestly, I'm so much happier now.
The more I allow this DIY musician life to consume me, the more insatiable I become. Over the last 2 ½ years, I have made leaps and bounds in my career. I have managed to form a band, recorded a single, performed at a multitude of venues in LA (including the famed Viper Room), performed internationally, created my own merch, and now recording my first album. Which brings me to why we’re here!
The Album
As a child of divorce and struggling with a learning disability, I turned to music as a way of healing and to express what I had difficulty putting into words. Now I hope that my music brings the same comfort and encouragement to others to persevere through their own hardships. I aspire to empower others through transparency, hard work, and music. This is why I decided to name my debut album INTREPID; which means fearless, adventurous, or ""very brave and willing to risk being in dangerous situations."" Intrepid encapsulates what life pushes and molds us to be. Most of the songs on this album, hash through some of my own life experiences that have shaped me into becoming more ""intrepid."" 
INTREPID features songs with a mix of topics and styles. ""Neglected,"" is a song about coming to terms with being mistreated and learning to put your own mental health first. ""Nightmares,"" is a song that details an incredibly difficult journey towards self-reliance. ""Black Coffee & Cigarettes"" is a bluesy, fanciful scenario about a chance interaction in a coffee shop. ""Songbird"" is a light-hearted, lullaby. I've poured my heart and soul into these songs and I'm so excited to share them with you! This album has been 6 years in the making and I sincerely hope that you find the solace and inspiration to be more INTREPID.

<p>RECORDING OF A LIVE DVD</p>
<p>I come from a small European country called Croatia. When I was 8 years old, just as I was starting primary school, I absolutely fell in love with the guitar. After finishing secondary school, I discovered jazz music, and went to study jazz and composition in Klagenfurt, Austria.</p>
<p>Since graduation, I have released 5 studio albums in different musical styles: heavy metal, jazz, acid jazz… All of this I financed from my own pocket so people would really get to know who I am and what I’m capable of.</p>
<p>At this moment I have a chance to play a concert in Croatia’s biggest concert hall “Lisinski”, which makes all the effort from all these years totally worth it. It’s a feeling that just can’t be put into words. I would be thrilled to record it on a live DVD album!</p>
<p>1.) If you help me with 10 dollars, you get my last album “Beauty of your soul”</p>
<p>2.) If you help me with more you can have the live recording and a ticket for my concert so you can be a part of it</p>
<p>3.) If you can’t help me with money, you can still help a lot by sharing my post on facebook, twitter, and other internet platforms</p>
<p>Any kind of help is well appreciated, and I hope you will get the DVD when it’s finished!</p>
<p>THX A LOT TO EVERYONE :)  STAY HAPPY AND POSITIVE!</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>My name is Choyce Schwartz and I am a singer-songwriter from Long Branch, NJ. I am currently working on my upcoming release, and looking to raise money to make a dynamic music video. I have attended performing arts schools for over 15 years, including The University of the Arts School of Music. I began songwriting and producing for artists when I was 19 years old. I've made some success working with popular artists, such as Eric Bellinger, but being a recording artist is my true passion. Last year was the year that I established a solo career of my own.</p>
<p>My music video embraces the idea of women ruling as it is related to Marvel’s fixation of female superheroes and female villains. My goal is to create a parallel world where women embrace their dominance and manifest their own power, whether for the use of good or evil.  Within this diverse concept, I want to bring people back to the early 2000s, and allow viewers to  experience this nostalgic era while associating my music video with new memories. During the creation process to this vision, I have integrated themes of action, using the movies <i>Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift </i>and <i>Rush Hour </i>to capture a world of thrill, high-risks, heists, fast cars, and of course, beautiful women.</p>
<p>In a thrilling alternate universe of action, De Royce and I find ourselves falling into the hands of ""dangerous"" women that just may bring us to our demise. The up-tempo song, sonically produced by OD Beats, was inspired by Marvel and <i>The Fast Saga,</i> highlighting the media franchise's ability to captivate viewers visually and musically. I have a very clear idea of the world I want to create around my music video, and its aesthetic. I would be so grateful for any and every contribution I am able to get in order to bring my vision to life. </p>
<p>I will use every penny of the funds to pay for the video and promotion for the video.  Even if I am unable to reach my goal of $500, I will still use whatever money I raised towards the video to make this video as successful as it can be. I need this amount of money in order to make the quality of the video I’ve envisioned, and to reach a vast audience. </p>
<p>  I am very grateful for any contributions I receive and appreciate the support! Aside from donations, sharing this project and my music will help me more than you know!   </p>

We did a second european run in april/may 2018, this time supporting Dark Tranquillity and Equilibrium. We signed a deal with swedish label Black Lion Records and released our third full length “Echoes Of Dying Memories” in 2019. WHAT WE WANT TO DO Due to the Covid-19 emergency, we can't go on the road again, but we want to give our fans a special livestream performance. Unfortunately, it is expensive to shoot a live concert in high quality and we need your help to cover the expenses. The concert will happen in July. We estimated that we can cover all the costs with 1400 eur.PERKSYou can choose among different rewards for helping us.

<h3>About me &amp; my Vision</h3>
<p>I need your help to share the best and most powerfully loving music I have performed at weddings to help make a difference with my music on a larger scale:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I began playing guitar at the age of 9 and continued studying through University at California State Sacramento. </p>
<p>I have played for audiences in excess of 1500 people as a solo artist, been promoted on the radio &amp; even played for the congressman of California... however the majority of my career over the last decade has been spent personalizing once-in-a-lifetime moments in people's lives in just about every context imaginable but the context I have been most passionate about is weddings.</p>
<p>The reason why I have devoted my life to supporting weddings is because as a child my heart's greatest desire was for my family to be able to love each other and remain committed to being there for one another. At the end of high school it became very apparent that no matter how hard I tried... I was not powerful enough to fix the dysfunctional family dynamics &amp; create a loving atmosphere to heal all that was broken. For a season of my life... being in the wrong place at the wrong time I turned to a number of things to try to run away from the pain of my family splitting apart including drugs, alcohol &amp; other damaging lifestyle choices. After the death of my dear best friend of ten years Arthur Smith (Art) for short... I had a new perspective about the value of life a dedicated what was left of my life to service towards others through my gift of music to help bring healing and ease to others in the world... and although I was not able to re-unite my family... over the last 10 years of my life I have had the power to help support some of the most precious moments in people's lives finding &amp; experiencing the most priceless gift... LOVE. After a decade of helping to bring literally 100's of families together with my music... I now want YOUR help to share this powerful music with a larger audience to make a difference with the music &amp; spirit behind my mission to a larger scale. The reason why the CD is entitled ""The Art of Love"" ... is because... Although my friend Arthur will never get to live out anymore of his purpose in this world... I feel I can honor his life in dedicating what his friendship gave to me and his life being gone... through offering this gift of love to the world. In doing so... honor my family... honor my friend's life... honor the life I have been given... and inspire many many thousands of other people in the world have amazing support through this message and music to truly transform the pain in their lives into something so beautiful that they cannot even express the joy in words.</p>
<p>In supporting the creation of this studio CD... you are helping to me to share this message of courage &amp; to make a difference on a larger scale rather than only the people's lives who are at the weddings that I perform at... but translating the power of impact to the concert stage as well as globally through making the music available world-wide through online marketing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to make this CD a reality here are the things the money will go to:</p>
<p>Studio Time - Studio time can cost about $450/day and about $3,150 for a week.</p>
<p>$500 Mastering, $45 Copyright of Song</p>
<p>Many of the songs I have already written and performed, and some even recorded... however... in order to re-record the songs in studio quality their is cost involved in studio time.</p>
<p>In addition, their is the cost of duplication of the CD's to have available for purchase online and at my concerts/shows as I develop a tour schedule to share the music with audiences/listeners.</p>
<p>For online distribution of the CD I plan to make it available on iTunes, Amazon MP3, Spotify, MySpace Music, MediaNet, eMusic, Zune, Rhapsody, Nokia, Napster, Thumbplay, Amazon On Demand to help extend the audience reach and visibility.</p>
<p>Some of the funds will also be used to pay some supporting musicians to play with me possibly at the LIVE CD release concert which I am working on getting bids from producers such as Mary Carrera of Carrera Productions and SBL Entertainment to produce at The Harris Center, 3 Stages in Folsom, CA.</p>
<p>I want you to get the excitement in being involved with this project. Whether you have been a past wedding client of mine, sponsor, industry associate, personal friend, acquaintance, family member, student, fan or anyone else who has in some way been impacted by my music... I want you to feel a part of championing the cause of courageously going after fighting for the maximum amount of fulfillment &amp; joy in your life on the other side of facing your fears. I want you to be able to experience feeling supported by me and my music as you continue to be touched by the impact I make in your life... as well as getting excited to see how me and my music will be impacting audiences and listeners to make it available to others on a larger scale.</p>
<p>If the full 25k is not reached, I will strip down the scale of the factors involved which will still advance the progress made in sharing the music to maximize the impact with smaller scale. Possibly use my own studio to cut cost of premium studio time... and allocate the funds to get the final product done at lower cost so as to allow for the best product at lowest cost to maximize funds to produce release concert as well as marketing and advertising.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact this project can make I believe is HUGE.</p>
<p>There are so many people in the world who have been deeply injured in life and many of which have lost objectivity to see the hope in ever experience the hope to love and be loved at a deep heart level again.</p>
<p>I want to support others with my story and my music to learn to take calculated wise risks to take the leap of faith with the art of love in their lives.</p>
<p>Weather that looks like someone who has lost their spouse (through death or divorce) to have a healing space in the music to grieve and reconnect gently to where they can begin inviting meaningful connections into their lives again, someone who has been choosing toxic relationships due to a fear of facing the scary truth of inner challenges in loving themselves before inviting someone else to love them... or any number of other scenarios that inquire incredible courage which challenges the core of their human bravery to not just survive life... but truly experience it... for all the beauty, joy &amp; wonderment that is possible on the other side of tragedy. </p>
<p>I have a 5 star rating with each and every wedding client that I have worked with over my decade long career which is evidence of my follow through commitment to seeing this vision be realized and shared. </p>
<p>I truly believe that my story and music has the power to change the world. </p>
<p>I would like you to join with me in being a part of that difference made, and in doing so... feel it to continue to make a difference in your story to be courageous as you make the most of ""the art of love"" in YOUR life</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It is true that I have never released a studio CD before in my career or produced a CD release concert. Because of this... I have been strategically laying the groundwork to connect and collaborate the wisdom from other people in the industry with the connections... wisdom and insight to really help me to make this a success. </p>
<p>I am meeting with production companies starting next week for bids on producing the CD release concert at Harris Center 3 stages and pick out a goal concert date which will fit nicely into me finishing production of this CD.</p>
<p>I have already begun rallying support from The Sacramento Guitar Society as well as other people who have marketing value to offer in me promoting the CD release concert once it is done to help spread the word and make it a HUGE success!</p>
<p>The challenge of not being a known concert artist with years of touring/selling concert tickets under my belt is something that all big house-hold names faced at some point with neysayers etc. My faith in my abilities, non-boastful but honest and valid confidence... commitment to surrounding myself with knowledgable talented people and follow through ability I believe will help me to overcome these challenges in launching my career as a concert artist.</p>
<p>As neysayers, see my action, &amp; successful results... I believe I will win them over and invite them to be a part of my success and sharing my joy!</p>

About me & my Vision
I need your help to share the best and most powerfully loving music I have performed at weddings to help make a difference with my music on a larger scale:
 
I began playing guitar at the age of 9 and continued studying through University at California State Sacramento. 
I have played for audiences in excess of 1500 people as a solo artist, been promoted on the radio & even played for the congressman of California... however the majority of my career over the last decade has been spent personalizing once-in-a-lifetime moments in people's lives in just about every context imaginable but the context I have been most passionate about is weddings.
The reason why I have devoted my life to supporting weddings is because as a child my heart's greatest desire was for my family to be able to love each other and remain committed to being there for one another. At the end of high school it became very apparent that no matter how hard I tried... I was not powerful enough to fix the dysfunctional family dynamics & create a loving atmosphere to heal all that was broken. For a season of my life... being in the wrong place at the wrong time I turned to a number of things to try to run away from the pain of my family splitting apart including drugs, alcohol & other damaging lifestyle choices. After the death of my dear best friend of ten years Arthur Smith (Art) for short... I had a new perspective about the value of life a dedicated what was left of my life to service towards others through my gift of music to help bring healing and ease to others in the world... and although I was not able to re-unite my family... over the last 10 years of my life I have had the power to help support some of the most precious moments in people's lives finding & experiencing the most priceless gift... LOVE. After a decade of helping to bring literally 100's of families together with my music... I now want YOUR help to share this powerful music with a larger audience to make a difference with the music & spirit behind my mission to a larger scale. The reason why the CD is entitled ""The Art of Love"" ... is because... Although my friend Arthur will never get to live out anymore of his purpose in this world... I feel I can honor his life in dedicating what his friendship gave to me and his life being gone... through offering this gift of love to the world. In doing so... honor my family... honor my friend's life... honor the life I have been given... and inspire many many thousands of other people in the world have amazing support through this message and music to truly transform the pain in their lives into something so beautiful that they cannot even express the joy in words.
In supporting the creation of this studio CD... you are helping to me to share this message of courage & to make a difference on a larger scale rather than only the people's lives who are at the weddings that I perform at... but translating the power of impact to the concert stage as well as globally through making the music available world-wide through online marketing.

What I Need & What You Get
In order to make this CD a reality here are the things the money will go to:
Studio Time - Studio time can cost about $450/day and about $3,150 for a week.
$500 Mastering, $45 Copyright of Song
Many of the songs I have already written and performed, and some even recorded... however... in order to re-record the songs in studio quality their is cost involved in studio time.
In addition, their is the cost of duplication of the CD's to have available for purchase online and at my concerts/shows as I develop a tour schedule to share the music with audiences/listeners.
For online distribution of the CD I plan to make it available on iTunes, Amazon MP3, Spotify, MySpace Music, MediaNet, eMusic, Zune, Rhapsody, Nokia, Napster, Thumbplay, Amazon On Demand to help extend the audience reach and visibility.
Some of the funds will also be used to pay some supporting musicians to play with me possibly at the LIVE CD release concert which I am working on getting bids from producers such as Mary Carrera of Carrera Productions and SBL Entertainment to produce at The Harris Center, 3 Stages in Folsom, CA.
I want you to get the excitement in being involved with this project. Whether you have been a past wedding client of mine, sponsor, industry associate, personal friend, acquaintance, family member, student, fan or anyone else who has in some way been impacted by my music... I want you to feel a part of championing the cause of courageously going after fighting for the maximum amount of fulfillment & joy in your life on the other side of facing your fears. I want you to be able to experience feeling supported by me and my music as you continue to be touched by the impact I make in your life... as well as getting excited to see how me and my music will be impacting audiences and listeners to make it available to others on a larger scale.
If the full 25k is not reached, I will strip down the scale of the factors involved which will still advance the progress made in sharing the music to maximize the impact with smaller scale. Possibly use my own studio to cut cost of premium studio time... and allocate the funds to get the final product done at lower cost so as to allow for the best product at lowest cost to maximize funds to produce release concert as well as marketing and advertising.

The Impact
The impact this project can make I believe is HUGE.
There are so many people in the world who have been deeply injured in life and many of which have lost objectivity to see the hope in ever experience the hope to love and be loved at a deep heart level again.
I want to support others with my story and my music to learn to take calculated wise risks to take the leap of faith with the art of love in their lives.

I am meeting with production companies starting next week for bids on producing the CD release concert at Harris Center 3 stages and pick out a goal concert date which will fit nicely into me finishing production of this CD.
I have already begun rallying support from The Sacramento Guitar Society as well as other people who have marketing value to offer in me promoting the CD release concert once it is done to help spread the word and make it a HUGE success!
The challenge of not being a known concert artist with years of touring/selling concert tickets under my belt is something that all big house-hold names faced at some point with neysayers etc. My faith in my abilities, non-boastful but honest and valid confidence... commitment to surrounding myself with knowledgable talented people and follow through ability I believe will help me to overcome these challenges in launching my career as a concert artist.
As neysayers, see my action, & successful results... I believe I will win them over and invite them to be a part of my success and sharing my joy!

<h2>Origins and the Ser Artista Album Project</h2>
<p>Orale! I am a queer Xicana singer-songwriter, guitarist, poet, composer, video documentary and music video filmmaker, and scholar. You can learn more about my work here: <a href=""http://www.diana-alvarez.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.diana-alvarez.com</a>.</p>
<p>While working on my PhD in Electronic Arts at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, I composed and staged <i>Quiero Volver: A Xicanx Ritual Opera</i>. This multimedia performance features my original music to honor the lives and work of women, non-binary and genderqueer artists of color. <i>Quiero Volver</i> was recognized by the press as a “visually and acoustically stunning performance” and raised over $10,000 to support immigrant justice initiatives when it was staged at the Academy of Music (Northampton, MA) in 2018.</p>
<p>I want to record and release my first studio album, <i>Ser Artista</i> to share the music from <i>Quiero Volver: A Xicanx Ritual Opera</i>, plus new songs from 2019 with you and with the world! My bilingual, soulful songs exalt queer love, liberation, ancestral lineage, and fiercely sing out against oppression. </p>
<h2>Here is what others have generously said about my work:</h2>
<p>""The virtuosic vocal finesse of Diana Alvarez is a wonder and a privilege to behold--and no surprise to witness every audience stunned into silent awe and transcendence."" -Pamela Means</p>
<p>""Soulful and natural."" -Natalie Merchant</p>
<p>""Diana’s voice, her ability to shift the room by allowing her research to inform her choices of sound, song selection, and phrasing is simply remarkable. For me personally, even on YouTube - her Quiero Volver: A Xicanx Ritual Opera trailer recalibrates my mood. This is true of so many of the women of color artists before her, like Bessie Smith for example – who was said to have been able to conjure with her voice."" -Sharon Bridgforth</p>
<p>""Diana Alvarez writes the truth through a tincture of magic and prayer, and both the spirits and the living are cupping their ears to listen."" -Sean Nevin</p>
<p>Should you contribute to the Ser Artista album project, you will support me, a queer Xicana performer who is the first in my family to attend college (let alone pursue and earn a PhD), whose work embodies coalition building and uprooting oppression, and who is committed to building family and community through performance.</p>
<p>I call myself science fiction, because I am in awe of where I've ended up after growing up motherless and raised by working class familia and mentors. I figure that if I can make a PhD and music career happen coming from no money and limited resources, I can make this album happen with help from my community! In return, I will continue to create performance gatherings for QPOC, activists, and artists with amazing collaborators. </p>
<h2>Let's Make This Album Happen!</h2>
<p>I have calculated that minimal costs to produce Ser Artista will be $6,000. Your funding will support the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-Producer Fees</li>
<li>Studio Fees (Recording, Mixing, Mastering)</li>
<li>Studio Musician Fees (Rehearsal and Recording)</li>
<li>Artwork/Graphic Design</li>
<li>CD Printing/Distribution</li>
<li>Publicity/Promotion</li>
<li>CD Release Events</li>
</ul>
<p><i>***To date, I have raised over $3,500 toward this album, which will cover about half of these costs. Since there has been so much momentum around this album, I have extended the date of the campaign to make sure that more people can be in community to support this work. </i></p>
<p>My superpower as an artist is to build up new(er) artists to own their craft. My perks for this campaign will include art work and lessons from collaborating artists who share my values, lessons and mentorship sessions with me, house concerts, birthday serenades, video editing sessions, and much more. If you are interested in supporting artists who nurture arts education and/or your own artistic journey, you've stopped at the right place.</p>
<p>Should I not reach my entire goal, I plan to still record and release music. I will scale down the project according to the budget. So, I might release an EP with fewer musical collaborators. Still a dream, just a more modest one. </p>
<h2>I Make Things Happen</h2>
<p>Here are a few unbelievable things I've accomplished:</p>
<ul>
<li>I continue to survive the early loss of my mother at age seven, plus the loss of most of my family (this has become a huge theme in my work, and why I center work around building chosen family)</li>
<li>I am the first in my family to earn a BA</li>
<li>I am the first in my family to earn an MFA in Poetry</li>
<li>I am the first in my family (and probably many families, for crying out loud) to earn a PhD in Electronic Arts</li>
<li>I composed and staged an original opera TWICE before completing my doctorate</li>
<li>Said opera raised $10,000 to support immigrant justice</li>
<li>I continue to heal, survive, create, teach, and inspire others to create art, though ""We were never meant to survive"" (Audre Lorde)</li>
<li>I build community for queer people of color, activists, and artists through regular performances, workshops, and fundraising events</li>
</ul>
<p>My <i>Ser Artista</i> album is one way to ensure that more people will hear my music, and that I continue to perform and tour with songs of liberation, queer love, and art.</p>
<p>I'd be honored to have you join me on this journey.</p>
<h2>This is Risky Business!</h2>
<p>Pursuing art, music, and performance is risky business because although art is crucial to our survival, we live in a world that doesn't always assign it value. We are also living in challenging times, when disposable income to support independent artists is just not an option for many. </p>
<p>I am invested in seeing my first studio album, Ser Artista through to its completion. Should I not meet my entire campaign goal, I will aim for a more modest recording in the form of an EP. Either way, I will create something to honor your contributions and faith in my work. </p>
<h2>Sing It Out, Share it With the World!</h2>
<p>If you are unable to contribute money to this project, I understand. You can still contribute in a HUGE way by sharing this campaign (use Indiegogo share tools please) online through your various media outlets. </p>

I am the first in my family (and probably many families, for crying out loud) to earn a PhD in Electronic Arts
I composed and staged an original opera TWICE before completing my doctorate
Said opera raised $10,000 to support immigrant justice
I continue to heal, survive, create, teach, and inspire others to create art, though ""We were never meant to survive"" (Audre Lorde)
I build community for queer people of color, activists, and artists through regular performances, workshops, and fundraising events

My Ser Artista album is one way to ensure that more people will hear my music, and that I continue to perform and tour with songs of liberation, queer love, and art.
I'd be honored to have you join me on this journey.
This is Risky Business!
Pursuing art, music, and performance is risky business because although art is crucial to our survival, we live in a world that doesn't always assign it value. We are also living in challenging times, when disposable income to support independent artists is just not an option for many. 
I am invested in seeing my first studio album, Ser Artista through to its completion. Should I not meet my entire campaign goal, I will aim for a more modest recording in the form of an EP. Either way, I will create something to honor your contributions and faith in my work. 
Sing It Out, Share it With the World!
If you are unable to contribute money to this project, I understand. You can still contribute in a HUGE way by sharing this campaign (use Indiegogo share tools please) online through your various media outlets.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We're a family of 7 living in Jeffrey’s Bay. Passionate about people, music, surfing &amp; travel and <br/>spreading hope with our songs and our story!</p>
<p>We have been married for 16 years and have 5 amazing children.</p>
<p>We were both born in the same hospital, lived in the same town and across the road from each other, went to the same school yet only met years later in Jeffreys Bay at Victory Gap year at the ages of 18 and 22.  And like one of our songs says ""Our roads crossed throughout our childhoods but we never knew, cos Father loves to hide things for us until the time is due.""  We can only look back in awe of the journey we have been on together in the community and church that He has placed us in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The songs on this album are snippets from the journey.  Our stories set to song. Some were written in a season of pain and frustration, while others come from a deep understanding that there is no growth without process.  Come lend your ears and hearts from and hopefully you to will be encouraged and enriched by the lyrics and melodies that flow from these songs.</p>
<p>The reason for this campaign, is to get our latest album out to our friends abroad.  We know some of you would love to be here but distance is a good excuse and so we want to include you into this experience by giving you the opportunity to get your hands on the TIME album and merchandise.  We can't make this sort of thing happen without funding and so we are creating a platform that enables your support and input.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What will you get for giving?</strong></p>
<p>We are making different products available for you to choose from such as:</p>
<p>- A signed copy of the EP album</p>
<p>- Wondering Watson's caps and other merchandise that will be available</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>We believe that music can have a powerful effect on people's lives.  Our songs are messages of hope in seasons of doubt and frustration.  We wish to share this with others as we know that it will inspire others to see the hope that we live by.</p>
<p>We are also aiming to give proceeds from the launch to Healthy Mom and Baby Clinic run by powerhouse friend Margreet Wibbelink.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>For many years we have tried to record songs but the timing has never been right.  Now that season has come of age and thanks to our friends and family we have been able to make this dream a reality.  </p>
<p><strong>Recording</strong></p>
<p>The album was recorded by Kurt Slabbert at BlueNoise Production's with the help of Bob Thorpe here in Jeffrey's Bay and so by raising funds for this launch you will enable us to do something special to give back to these amazing people.</p>
<p><strong>Venue</strong></p>
<p>The venue where we are launching the album will need some decor, sound and lighting and other items.  Your contribution will make the evening extra special.</p>
<p><strong>Printing and Distribution of the Album</strong></p>
<p>Just when you think that the album is done you are faced with the dilemma of actually getting the music into your hands.  Your funding will help us design, print, burn and distribute the album.</p>

I’ve been a lifelong Artist but burst onto the music scene in 2013, finally in pursuit of my dream to be a SupaStar entertainer who empowers the LGBTQ community, People of Color, Women and Girls, globally.

And now at a high point in my journey, I am ready to share my experiences with you through my sophomore EP, Reborn, to be released in late fall 2019. The EP will examine such themes as Sexual Revolution, Relationship Trauma, Loss of Loves/Death and the Healing Power of Music &amp; Dance. Reborn will also showcase my evolution as an Artist with new sounds and persona, that authentically reflect my creative expression today.</p><p>My brilliant, long-time music partner, Hermann Unterwurzacher, will compose the music for the majority of the songs on Reborn.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Connor Roy. I'm a Singer-Songwriter and Worship Leader from Detroit, MI. I have been playing guitar since second grade and writing songs since the age of 12. I released my very first full-length album in 2014 and feel the time is right to work on my second full-length album! I've created this campaign to get people involved in the process! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As you might know, a full-length album can be very costly. I'm reaching out to you for help in this process. You'll be a major part of getting this project off the ground! I'm asking for $5,000 to put towards this project. The money will go towards studio time, production costs, and graphic design. If I raise more than the specified amount, I can put that towards merch and other fun stuff for all of the supporters! Some of the perks I'll be offering will be an opportunity to sit in on a studio session and check out what my producer and I do behind the scenes! I'll also be offering exclusive merch items such as an autographed poster, my entire discography on CDs (including the new album when it is released), as well as a shirt exclusively made for those who support the campaign!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is a project that God has laid on my heart. My prayer is that each song would speak to someone's heart and that through this project people would come to know Jesus in a real way! You can help be a part of sending this message out by making a contribution. Jesus said to go into all the world and preach the Gospel and music is simply the vehicle that I use to do that. I'm extremely passionate about what I do so each project is special and unique. Each project has a special place in my heart. Please consider making a contribution in addition to praying for this project and all of those who would hear it</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While there is always a risk of not raising the full amount, the money raised through this campaign will be put towards this project nonetheless. God continues to provide for each project and I anticipate that He will provide for this one as well.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to make a financial contribution, please pray for this project. Prayers are the most important thing! Secondly, if you could share this project with friends, family, co-workers, or anyone with access to the internet, I would greatly appreciate it! If just 500 people donated $10, that equals $5,000. I have over 1,000 friends on Facebook so 500 people is just a small chunk of that. </p>

<h3>Who Is Babu Oji?</h3>
<p>I am Babu Oji. I am a Hindu &amp; Buddhist. I've been producing music for myself for about 8 years now, prior to that I KNEW I could not make music. I knew that. We know a lot of things. And then we get new things to know. My music is not about unlearning nor learning. It's about heart. And it's about healing. It's about emotion, and dealing. Please join me as I take you through my spiritual pursuit, and find reflections and commonalities that ground you in yours.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where Will The Funds Go?</h3>
<p>Parts. I need parts. Computer parts. My gear is jank and it doesn't wanna fly with much. Producing, mixing, mastering, these take a lot out of a computer. And mine can't really handle it.</p>
<h3>Risks?</h3>
<p>I've been making music for a long time, so finishing the project when I have the right gear is no real worry. But I am at the risk of being homeless. I've been looking into federal jobs via Application A (Help for the Disabled), so this risk should be minimized soon.</p>
