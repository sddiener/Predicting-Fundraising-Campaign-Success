<p>In the last week of April we will be taking our food waste campaign on the road in our mobile kitchen Food Rescue Ambulance and show <b>solidarity</b> with <b>Calais Migrant Camp. </b></p>
<p>We will provide hot food from our food rescue ambulance, and drop off 
supplies of food and other much needed items.</p>
<p> We will operate a <b>temporary outdoor kitchen aiming to serve 2 hot meals a day.</b><br/></p>
<p>This is because  <b>we believe
 EVERY human being has a right to food, shelter and a life free from 
violence</b>, and deserve a chance to be the people that they are. <br/></p>
<p>We will be
 raising awareness about the situation in Calais before, during and after the trip. <br/></p>

He is now, however in desperate need of treatment for his eating disorder.  Even with insurance it will cost around $6500 for the care he needs at a long term care facility.  At one time Jackie weighed ALMOST 600 lbs.  Jacky had surgery and then worked his butt off to lose almost 400 lbs.

<p>WOW came together by 3 women who wanted to help  making the world a better place. After attending one Safe for Life workshop and seeing what is offered to help and protect women, we decided to team up with Wes Derequito of Ara Academy, the creator of Safe for Life Montreal. His vision to create a proper program which offers education, mental and emotional help as well as physical training for women lacked funds. Not all women can afford to get the help required as the process in helping a battered woman is different versus a woman who wants to make sure she is never in that situation. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE SCARED OR APOLOGIZE FOR BEING WOMEN!!!! Let's get together to be part of the change!!!</p>

<p>WOW will be organizing an event using Fashion. Fashion is just another form of art allowing us to express ourselves. It can be used to represent a woman’s strength, desire or state of mind.

<p><b>SAFE FOR LIFE PROGRAM SUMMARY</b></p>
<p>The primary goal of the SAFE FOR LIFE PROGRAM is <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">to teach women aspects of self-development through the practice of self-defense and to promote the understanding  self-respect. We start by defining the true nature of self-defense, which begins with the ""<i>self </i>"" - being aware of one's mental, emotional and physical attritubutes and more importantly, understanding the role of ""<i>ego</i>"". <br/><br/>The women will learn how to manage fear and understand the difference between true fear and unwarranted fear, through specific exercises that avoid a false sense of security.</span></p>
<p><br/> We also cover environmental/situational awareness, including recognizing and avoiding potential violent situations. We then train the women to understand direct behaviour and physical/psychological cues in order to act accordingly using relatively simple yet, highly effective concepts.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">By the end of this program, each individual will be able to:</span><br/></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Evaluate and develop themselves physically, psychologically and emotionally by understanding their strengths and limited beliefs, to better evaluate and manage any situation.</p></li>
<li><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Understand  their surroundings and their physical, psychological and emotional environment.</span><br/></p></li>
<li><p>Understand the pre-contact phases, specifically human communication (human behaviour and body language), and how to use <i>verbal diffusion</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop the appropriate action for the appropriate reaction. “Action–Reaction-Action.”</p></li>
<li><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">To care about the “<i>self</i>” aspect – because <b>everybody </b>is worth fighting for, and it might as well be themselves doing it.<br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/>This program is designed for women in their late teens or older. No prior experience necessary. This is <b>not </b>a traditional martial arts program, rather a reality based self-defense program. </span><br/></span></p></li>

<p>We sincerely hope that you can be part of this, and help us achieve our goals!<br/><br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are the local Kappa Sigma chapter in Greenville, PA. We were founded 1996, which is when we started this fundraising event. Every year, we spend 72 hours riding a 10-foot long See-Saw raising money for a local cancer patient. In the past 5 years, we've raised close to $13,000 for these patients treatments. By contributing to our cause, you will be helping us to pay for these expensive treatments for our recipients.This year, we have selected an 8 year old leukemia patient at Akron hospital as the beneficiary of our annual See-saw-athon.</p>
<p>We're hoping to raise as much money as we possibly can for this patient. These patients are going through so much more than any of us could ever imagine, and we need to help them. Whatever money we collect will go straight to this patient. We hope to cover as much of their treatment payments as possible. </p>
<p>As a local fraternity chapter, we do everything we can to help the community. This is just one of the many service projects we do throughout the year to contribute to the community. By donating to this See-Saw-a-thon, you are helping to make someone's life just a little bit easier.</p>
<p>If you are unable to donate to this fundraiser, please spread the word to anyone you can. This patient can use as much support as possible, and that's what we are trying to do.

When we launched the first ever formal <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/one-pound-for-wingsland/x/2346389"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">public fundraising appeal</a> for a Scottish political website (indeed, as far as we know the first for a politics site anywhere in Britain), your response was incredible.</p><p>Our £30,000 target was <a href=""http://wingsoverscotland.com/a-gap-in-the-market/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">smashed</a>, enabling the site to become a full-time professional concern, and others followed in our footsteps. By our reckoning around <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence-blog/2014/jan/22/scottish-independence-crowdfunding"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">£150,000</a> was raised in 2013 for various pro-independence sites and projects, including the Common Weal and <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/scotland-yet-feature-length-documentary-on-scottish-independence/x/2346389"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Scotland Yet""</a>, a full-length documentary currently being produced by Jack Foster and Christopher Silver, makers of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulrbCY0Ces"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""The Fear Factor""</a>.</p><p>Now it's time to finish the job.</p><p><img alt="""" class=""mce-wp-more mceItemNoResize lazy"" data-src=""http://wingsoverscotland.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""More...""/></p><p>We pledged last year that in return for your money and your trust we'd devote ourselves to the site, give you more articles and bring the facts and arguments about independence to a wider audience.

And as our properly-researched, fully-sourced information and arguments have reached more and more of the people of Scotland, so the <a href=""http://wingsoverscotland.com/convergence-keeps-converging/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gap in the opinion polls has closed</a>.</p><p>(Not that we're taking all the credit for that, of course, but a recent poll for STV found that this website is <a href=""http://wingsoverscotland.com/in-the-clouds/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the single most-relied-on named source</a> for independence facts in Scotland, so it seems fair to say we've done our bit.)</p><p>It would seem a shame to stop now. But we've spent all of last year's money, so it's time for us to ask you to put your hands in your pockets again.</p><p>This year's target is an ambitious <strong>£50,000</strong>. That's a lot of cash, but then there's a lot to do. Here's what we want it for:</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><strong>1. SALARY</strong></p><p>Keen readers will have noticed that as editor I usually put in around 16 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year - from reading and tweeting interesting stories from the papers around 6-7am to throwing things at the TV screen during Newsnight Scotland at 11pm.</p><p>But I do pop out to the shops sometimes and I don't want to play the martyr, so let's only call half of that work time - that's 50 hours a week. The UK living wage is <a href=""http://www.livingwage.org.uk/blog/new-uk-living-wage-%C2%A3765-new-london-rate-%C2%A3880"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">£7.65 an hour</a>, which comes to <strong>£19,890</strong> a year. It's not a fortune (it's nearly £7000 less than the <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20442666"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UK average</a>) but it'll keep the lights on at Wings HQ.</p><p><em>(Why a full year with only seven months to the referendum? Because we're not hypothesising on defeat - if and when we win the subsequent negotiations will be every bit as important as the campaign, so we plan to be watching the politicians and media just as closely as we do now.)</em></p><p><strong>2. RUNNING COSTS</strong></p><p>We've been a victim of our own success - our webhosting costs, for example, recently jumped by over <strong>600%</strong> to cope with our rocketing traffic figures.</p><p>We're just finalising the move across to a new seriously-upgraded server which should cope better, and also reduce the security measures we've had to adopt to cope with a malicious and ongoing attack aimed at taking the site down. We're budgeting <strong>£3000</strong> for hosting and other expenses.</p><p><strong>3. PROJECT BLUE</strong></p><p>The thing we want to do more than anything else this year is <a href=""http://wingsoverscotland.com/preparing-for-project-blue/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Wee Blue Book</a>. This will be a printed pocket-sized booklet, 32 or 48 pages in total, containing the most concise and accessible summaries of all the key issues about independence that we can muster, dealing with all of the No campaign's scare stories and putting the facts right at people's fingertips, ready to refer to wherever you may be.</p><p>We think printed material is vital, because you can only reach so many people on the internet. It won't be cheap. We'll write the words, but we'll need a professional to design it and lay it out and then we'll have to print thousands of copies and distribute them across Scotland. We tentatively reckon <strong>£15,000</strong> will do it.</p><p><strong>4. MORE POLLS</strong></p><p>Our Panelbase opinion polls - crowdfunded separately last year - have played a significant part in the debate, generating significant amounts of media coverage and bringing many new readers to the site. We've got a little bit of money still left in the polling fund, but we'd like to top it up and do at least two more between now and September. That'll take around <strong>£8000</strong>.</p><p><strong>5. A LITTLE HELP</strong></p><p>We've carried posts by around <strong>50</strong> different authors. Many contribute regularly, like <a href=""http://wingsoverscotland.com/tag/scott-minto/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Scott Minto</a>'s invaluable in-depth features and <a href=""http://wingsoverscotland.com/tag/chris-cairns/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chris Cairns</a>' brilliant weekly cartoons. These take hours or even days of work, and people deserve to be paid.</p><p>We also haven't had a day off in the last 18 months, and it'd be nice to be able to commission a few pieces to cover a weekend break once in a blue moon. Can we find a modest <strong>£4000 </strong>for all of those things?</p><p><strong>6. THE MIDDLE MAN</strong></p><p>Indiegogo make running a fundraiser like this easy and straightforward both for us and people who want to donate. Very reasonably they take a small cut for that service, which means that to actually get £50,000 we have to take in another <strong>£3000</strong> on top.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>And just like that, there's £53,000. Ooft. It's a lot of money - more than anyone has asked for or achieved before - but we think that the breakdown above is offering pretty good value for it, and we hope you'll agree.</p><p><a href=""http://wingsoverscotland.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/stretch.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""stretch"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-50848 lazy"" data-src=""http://wingsoverscotland.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/stretch-460x258.jpg"" src="""" style=""display: block;""/></a></p><p>Should we be lucky enough to <em>exceed</em> it, we've got a whole raft of what in the fundraising business are called ""stretch goals"" - other projects we'd like to do:</p><p>- We'd like to produce more printed materials, perhaps including a paper edition of <a href=""http://www.scoop.it/t/the-sealand-gazette/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Sealand Gazette</a>.</p><p>- We really want to do some live events, such as Q&amp;A sessions for undecided voters in locations around Scotland. Those will cost money to hire venues and equipment, produce flyers for and so on.</p><p>- Undertaking some promotional work - readers have suggested hiring billboards in railway stations to bring more people to the site, for example. They're not as expensive as you might think.</p><p>But let's not get ahead of ourselves - we can worry about those if we get past the initial goal, and that's a big enough ask to be going on with for now.</p><p>There are a lot of you out there, but times are hard and not everyone can spare money.

When we launched the first ever formal public fundraising appeal for a Scottish political website (indeed, as far as we know the first for a politics site anywhere in Britain), your response was incredible.Our £30,000 target was smashed, enabling the site to become a full-time professional concern, and others followed in our footsteps. By our reckoning around £150,000 was raised in 2013 for various pro-independence sites and projects, including the Common Weal and ""Scotland Yet"", a full-length documentary currently being produced by Jack Foster and Christopher Silver, makers of ""The Fear Factor"".Now it's time to finish the job.We pledged last year that in return for your money and your trust we'd devote ourselves to the site, give you more articles and bring the facts and arguments about independence to a wider audience. We like to think we've delivered.MONTHLY READERSHIPJan 2013: 29,769Feb 2014: 233,296MONTHLY PAGEVIEWSJan 2013: 755,406Feb 2014: 3,647,300POSTS PUBLISHEDYear to Feb 2013: 632Year to Feb 2014: 1,211In the last 12 months Wings Over Scotland has been visited by 959,086 unique readers - almost a quarter of the entire Scottish electorate. And as our properly-researched, fully-sourced information and arguments have reached more and more of the people of Scotland, so the gap in the opinion polls has closed.(Not that we're taking all the credit for that, of course, but a recent poll for STV found that this website is the single most-relied-on named source for independence facts in Scotland, so it seems fair to say we've done our bit.)It would seem a shame to stop now. But we've spent all of last year's money, so it's time for us to ask you to put your hands in your pockets again.This year's target is an ambitious £50,000. That's a lot of cash, but then there's a lot to do. Here's what we want it for:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. SALARYKeen readers will have noticed that as editor I usually put in around 16 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year - from reading and tweeting interesting stories from the papers around 6-7am to throwing things at the TV screen during Newsnight Scotland at 11pm.But I do pop out to the shops sometimes and I don't want to play the martyr, so let's only call half of that work time - that's 50 hours a week. The UK living wage is £7.65 an hour, which comes to £19,890 a year. It's not a fortune (it's nearly £7000 less than the UK average) but it'll keep the lights on at Wings HQ.(Why a full year with only seven months to the referendum? Because we're not hypothesising on defeat - if and when we win the subsequent negotiations will be every bit as important as the campaign, so we plan to be watching the politicians and media just as closely as we do now.)2. RUNNING COSTSWe've been a victim of our own success - our webhosting costs, for example, recently jumped by over 600% to cope with our rocketing traffic figures.We're just finalising the move across to a new seriously-upgraded server which should cope better, and also reduce the security measures we've had to adopt to cope with a malicious and ongoing attack aimed at taking the site down. We're budgeting £3000 for hosting and other expenses.3. PROJECT BLUEThe thing we want to do more than anything else this year is The Wee Blue Book. This will be a printed pocket-sized booklet, 32 or 48 pages in total, containing the most concise and accessible summaries of all the key issues about independence that we can muster, dealing with all of the No campaign's scare stories and putting the facts right at people's fingertips, ready to refer to wherever you may be.We think printed material is vital, because you can only reach so many people on the internet. It won't be cheap. We'll write the words, but we'll need a professional to design it and lay it out and then we'll have to print thousands of copies and distribute them across Scotland. We tentatively reckon £15,000 will do it.4. MORE POLLSOur Panelbase opinion polls - crowdfunded separately last year - have played a significant part in the debate, generating significant amounts of media coverage and bringing many new readers to the site. We've got a little bit of money still left in the polling fund, but we'd like to top it up and do at least two more between now and September. That'll take around £8000.5. A LITTLE HELPWe've carried posts by around 50 different authors. Many contribute regularly, like Scott Minto's invaluable in-depth features and Chris Cairns' brilliant weekly cartoons. These take hours or even days of work, and people deserve to be paid.We also haven't had a day off in the last 18 months, and it'd be nice to be able to commission a few pieces to cover a weekend break once in a blue moon. Can we find a modest £4000 for all of those things?6. THE MIDDLE MANIndiegogo make running a fundraiser like this easy and straightforward both for us and people who want to donate. Very reasonably they take a small cut for that service, which means that to actually get £50,000 we have to take in another £3000 on top.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------And just like that, there's £53,000. Ooft. It's a lot of money - more than anyone has asked for or achieved before - but we think that the breakdown above is offering pretty good value for it, and we hope you'll agree.Should we be lucky enough to exceed it, we've got a whole raft of what in the fundraising business are called ""stretch goals"" - other projects we'd like to do:- We'd like to produce more printed materials, perhaps including a paper edition of The Sealand Gazette.- We really want to do some live events, such as Q&A sessions for undecided voters in locations around Scotland. Those will cost money to hire venues and equipment, produce flyers for and so on.- Undertaking some promotional work - readers have suggested hiring billboards in railway stations to bring more people to the site, for example. They're not as expensive as you might think.But let's not get ahead of ourselves - we can worry about those if we get past the initial goal, and that's a big enough ask to be going on with for now.There are a lot of you out there, but times are hard and not everyone can spare money. If you can't, don't fret about it, and definitely don't send us anything you can't really afford - there are plenty of other ways you can help out, by tweeting and sharing links and telling people about the site. We'd be nothing without all the people who've spread the word in the last 12 months.But if you've got a couple of quid burning a hole in your pocket, and a desire for independence burning in your heart, we reckon you could do worse than send a wee something our way. We'll make good use of it, we promise.",3.0,0,"12 Campaigns

and somehow make my way across via the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas
to fly home from the East Coast on March 31st.

I'm particularly interested in what happens when I give up control of the trip and actively ask for help.

will of course be creating a multimedia blog about the experience as

We then went a step further and replaced the sodium which is in most other energy drinks with potassium.  Other healthy ingredients include thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B-12, and folate acid. There is also a sugar free version of Re-Up.  Our belief that this is a more healthful alternative was affirmed when our drink was approved by the US Navy Chief Flight surgeon after comparing to other leading energy drinks.</p>

You know of many women and infants in the village who have not survived this.<br/><br/> Once your baby is born she is placed on the ground off to the side while the midwife focuses on you - the one with the better chance of survival. Once you are cleaned up and sleeping she turns her attention to the baby. Hopefully the baby doesn't aspirate amniotic fluid or meconium since there is no bulb syringe to clean out her nose and throat. Hopefully she doesn't need medical attention because none is near. Hopefully she will live.</p>

<h2 class=""p1""><strong>Background:</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2"">Asiri is a small rural village in Ghana, West Africa. As a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer it has been my home for two lovely years. I have spent this time falling in love with the village and giving it everything I have in order to better the lives of the people here who have become my extended family. The community and I have worked on projects in the realms of agriculture, health, education and income generation.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Our focus now is addressing the critical issues of maternal &amp; infant health and obstetrics in the village.</p>
<p><span>Delivery by a traditional birth attendant or midwife has been the common practice here for as long as the village has existed. Though it is prevalent all over Ghana, there are many aspects of it that are potentially exceedingly damaging and life-threatening to both mother and child. Babies are often pulled out too roughly, causing life-long damage to the child’s body, and aren’t given to the mother to nurse upon delivery. Gloveless fingers inserted into the mother continuously during labour, between the midwife cooking food, caring for children and going about her daily life, readily create infection. Among countless other concerns, there is no testing for diseases, HIV/AIDS, or anything else, as there is for births in proper clinics.</span></p>
<p class=""p2"">The people of Asiri tried to build a maternity clinic some years ago. They built the foundation and sandcrete block walls that you see below, but then money ran out. Due to endemic poverty, drought and other factors, there are just no funds to complete it. The people have assured me time and time again that if the materials are made available, the entire community will pitch in to construct it.</p>
<p class=""p2""><img alt=""Unfinished Maternity Clinic"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://changetheworldofone.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/unfinished-clinic.jpeg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Unfinished Maternity Clinic""/></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>Mission:</strong></h2>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li>To decrease maternal and infant mortality in Asiri</li>
<li>To make the birth process in Asiri safer, more comfortable and hygienic</li>
<li>To build the capacity of the local midwife and bring in a qualified doctor</li>
<li>To decrease teenaged pregnancies &amp; increase family planning</li>
<li>To improve pre-natal and ante-natal care</li>
<li>To provide free HIV testing and counseling for the entire village</li>
</ul>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>Vision:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The people of Asiri will have a safe, comfortable, clean atmosphere full of knowledgable staff in which to deal with all aspects of delivering and caring for their children and themselves.</strong></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>Approach:</strong></h2>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li>Finish building the maternity clinic</li>
<li>Furnish and stock the clinic with equipment and supplies</li>
<li>Train the midwife on best practices</li>
<li>Teach her how to use the new equipment and supplies</li>
<li>Create mother support groups</li>
<li>Conduct classes for mothers and young women on nutrition, HIV/AIDS, family planning, general health and infant care</li>
</ul>
<h2>How you can help:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Donate funds to help us meet our goal so we can build and furnish the clinic</li>
<li>Donate supplies: baby blankets, newborn apparel, medical supplies etc.<br/><br/>Send them to: <br/><img alt=""Jasmine's Address"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://changetheworldofone.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/address1.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Jasmine't Address""/><br/><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Spread the word! The more people who know about this cause, the more can help!</li>

<h2>Funds will be used for:</h2>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Building materials:</span> cement, sand, gravel, lumber, electrical wiring materials, nails, doors, windows, hinges, locks, paint, brushes, floor and wall tiles, etc (we already have roofing sheets, iron rods and part of the lumber)</p>

<p><strong><em>In Ghana, the deaf are at an economic disadvantage. Deaf people are marginalized by stigmas rooted in traditional beliefs and are often relegated to the outskirts of towns. Those lucky enough to be placed in schools are given hope, while many do not have the opportunity to attend schools and remain in their villages and left to a life of hard farming and manual labor. Many people believe that the deaf cannot learn and, therefore, there is no reason to send them to schools. Others believe that deafness is a curse, passed along as punishment for past transgressions. At Our Talking Hands, the deaf and hearing work side by side. We seek to dispel harmful myths while producing some of the finest African arts and crafts in the community.</em></strong></p>

Being a woman or girl in a dusty rural village, walking into an unlit room without access to electricity or running water. You remove all of your clothing and lie down on the cement floor as labor pains wrack your body. You prepare yourself for the most painful event of your life, one that very well might kill you.
There are no drugs to dull your pain, no gloves to protect you from germs, no instruments to monitor your baby's progress, and not a single doctor or nurse nearby. Labor will continue for hours on end, perhaps even days. This is the most natural human phenomenon in the world, yet it's absolutely terrifying. You have lost control of your body.

Once your baby is born she is placed on the ground off to the side while the midwife focuses on you - the one with the better chance of survival. Once you are cleaned up and sleeping she turns her attention to the baby. Hopefully the baby doesn't aspirate amniotic fluid or meconium since there is no bulb syringe to clean out her nose and throat. Hopefully she doesn't need medical attention because none is near. Hopefully she will live.

Background:
Asiri is a small rural village in Ghana, West Africa. As a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer it has been my home for two lovely years. I have spent this time falling in love with the village and giving it everything I have in order to better the lives of the people here who have become my extended family. The community and I have worked on projects in the realms of agriculture, health, education and income generation.
Our focus now is addressing the critical issues of maternal & infant health and obstetrics in the village.
Delivery by a traditional birth attendant or midwife has been the common practice here for as long as the village has existed. Though it is prevalent all over Ghana, there are many aspects of it that are potentially exceedingly damaging and life-threatening to both mother and child. Babies are often pulled out too roughly, causing life-long damage to the child’s body, and aren’t given to the mother to nurse upon delivery. Gloveless fingers inserted into the mother continuously during labour, between the midwife cooking food, caring for children and going about her daily life, readily create infection. Among countless other concerns, there is no testing for diseases, HIV/AIDS, or anything else, as there is for births in proper clinics.
The people of Asiri tried to build a maternity clinic some years ago. They built the foundation and sandcrete block walls that you see below, but then money ran out. Due to endemic poverty, drought and other factors, there are just no funds to complete it. The people have assured me time and time again that if the materials are made available, the entire community will pitch in to construct it.

Mission:

To decrease maternal and infant mortality in Asiri
To make the birth process in Asiri safer, more comfortable and hygienic
To build the capacity of the local midwife and bring in a qualified doctor
To decrease teenaged pregnancies & increase family planning
To improve pre-natal and ante-natal care
To provide free HIV testing and counseling for the entire village

Vision:
The people of Asiri will have a safe, comfortable, clean atmosphere full of knowledgable staff in which to deal with all aspects of delivering and caring for their children and themselves.
Approach:

Finish building the maternity clinic
Furnish and stock the clinic with equipment and supplies
Train the midwife on best practices
Teach her how to use the new equipment and supplies
Create mother support groups
Conduct classes for mothers and young women on nutrition, HIV/AIDS, family planning, general health and infant care

How you can help:

Donate funds to help us meet our goal so we can build and furnish the clinic
Donate supplies: baby blankets, newborn apparel, medical supplies etc.Send them to: 

Spread the word! The more people who know about this cause, the more can help!

Funds will be used for:
Building materials: cement, sand, gravel, lumber, electrical wiring materials, nails, doors, windows, hinges, locks, paint, brushes, floor and wall tiles, etc (we already have roofing sheets, iron rods and part of the lumber)
Furniture: delivery beds, chairs, desks, shelves, tables, filing cabinets
Furnishings: ceiling fans, blankets, sheets, curtains, informational posters
Recording supplies: file folders, stationary, pens, record books
Medical Supplies: incubator, oxygen cylinder, drip/infusion pole, baby weighing scale, catgut, standing lamps, refrigerator for medicine, suction bulbs, stethoscope, fetoscope, gloves, surgery instruments, blood pressure cuff, hemostats, specula, forceps, needles, needle holders, catheters, rubber apron, syringes, gauze, disinfectant, episiotomy scissors, long scissors, umbilical scissors, cord clamps, etc
Our funding goal - $14,800 - is the bare bones estimate of what we will need to finish the clinic. Any additional funds will go to stocking extra or better equipment and materials for the clinic, or to training materials/sessions for the midwife and doctor.

Our Talking Hands (OTH) – A Non-Profit Organization supporting the deaf in Ghana 
Providing lovely handmade crafts that will support both the clinic and their remarkable work with the deaf community in Ghana

Our Talking Hands is a non-profit organization located in Hohoe, Ghana, West Africa, that supports Ghana's deaf community by providing sustainable livelihoods through the making of gorgeous, well-made local crafts.

Their mission:
“Our Talking Hands has two primary goals: to provide our customers with unique, high quality, handmade apparel and to afford Ghana’s deaf community with sustainable livelihoods.

In Ghana, the deaf are at an economic disadvantage. Deaf people are marginalized by stigmas rooted in traditional beliefs and are often relegated to the outskirts of towns. Those lucky enough to be placed in schools are given hope, while many do not have the opportunity to attend schools and remain in their villages and left to a life of hard farming and manual labor. Many people believe that the deaf cannot learn and, therefore, there is no reason to send them to schools. Others believe that deafness is a curse, passed along as punishment for past transgressions. At Our Talking Hands, the deaf and hearing work side by side. We seek to dispel harmful myths while producing some of the finest African arts and crafts in the community.

Our Talking Hands is rooted in the deaf community, but remains open to any artists or groups that commit to working with the deaf community as educators, employers, or mentors. We value independence and wish to empower individuals, but we also strive to promote interdependence through collaboration and inclusion. Proceeds from our sales assist in the development of schools for the deaf in Ghana, with the hopes of growing our mission to include neighboring countries in West Africa. By supporting the local schools in Ghana, we hope to equip the students with the necessary skills to gain employment and become economically independent.”

<h3>The Story </h3>
<p>A man's quest to overcome his fear of rejection by making at least one crazy request a day for 100 days was throttled last week when a Krispy Kreme employee accepted his order for five doughnuts linked together in the colors and shape of the Olympic symbol.</p>
<p>""It's only my third day and I have already failed,"" Jia Jiang wrote on his 100 Days of Rejection Therapy blog. ""But I did so with such amazement and happiness.""</p>
<p>When the 31-year-old approached the register to make his ""specialized"" doughnut order, Jackie Braun, a shift leader at an Austin, Texas, Krispy Kreme, asked him when he would need it.</p>
<p>""In the next 15 minutes,"" Jiang replied.</p>
<p>""I was honestly just hoping for a 'no' and to go home,"" Jiang told Yahoo News in an interview on Monday.</p>
<p>(Krispy Kreme)</p>
<p>Instead, Braun spent several minutes using the back of some receipt paper to diagram the unusual order.</p>
<p>""Let me see what I can do,"" she said.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, she emerged with a Krispy Kreme box with the glazed Olympic ring arrangement inside—and, astonishingly, did not charge Jiang for it.</p>
<p>""It wasn't exactly what he wanted,"" Braun told Yahoo News. ""To my eyes, it wasn't perfect, so I didn't think I should charge him for it. It was the best I could do in the time allotted.""</p>
<p>""Wow, Jackie, I'm a fan,"" Jiang told her, on behalf of everyone in America.</p>
<p>""I was overwhelmed, I couldn't believe it,"" Jiang said. ""I went home and tweeted to Krispy Kreme and blogged about it. I wanted the world to know about what she did.""</p>
<p>A campaign to get Braun a raise and promotion was quickly launched in the Youtube comments section underneath Jiang's video.</p>
<p>""Jackie is awesome,"" more than one viewer wrote. ""The world needs more people like her.""</p>
<p>""Yo, if Krispy Kreme doesn't promote her to CEO I'm boycotting!"" wrote another. ""And I love doughnuts.""</p>
<p>Jiang, who launched a Facebook page called ""Give Jackie at Krispy Kreme a Raise,"" said he returned to Krispy Kreme on Sunday to thank Braun for going above and beyond the call of doughnut duty.</p>
<p>Braun, though, said she didn't do anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>""It was a simple thing,"" Braun, who's been with Krispy Kreme for five years, said. ""The Olympic symbol was the only unusual part, because they're not on TV right now. But we do orders like that every day. We're here to make people happy.""</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How you can help!</h3>
<p>Donate what you can! Even a dollar would go a long way in helping Jackie out! If you dont have the money you can still help out by sharing this page through various social media websites you use.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What This is For</h3>
<p>Our goal is to help Jackie any way she needs right now whether that be a MUCH deserved vacation to helping with anything in her personal life!</p>

viaggio di ricerca nomade attraverso i resistenti alla modernità. Due
antropologi non ancora famosi che vogliono imparare, documentare e
diffondere un nuovo ma antico modo di vivere. Riscoprire antichi
saperi, ricominciare a lavorare con le mani, ritrovare un equilibrio
con il Pianeta.</b></i></p>
<p></p>
<br/><p>
<b>Cosa
vogliamo fare</b></p>
<p>
Il
nostro è un progetto di ricerca itinerante, un viaggio di
(ri)scoperta. Attraverseremo l'Europa con i nostri taccuini, il
nostro pc, foto e videocamera per scoprire comunità agricole,
ecovillaggi e famiglie che hanno scelto di resistere alla modernità
e condurre una vita meno legata al sistema consumistico.  Vogliamo analizzare e documentare quali strategie queste comunità adottano per organizzare la loro vita resistente.Tramite la condivisione del lavoro impareremo
ciò che pensiamo possa tornare utile il giorno che decideremo di
smettere di essere nomadi e di costruire una comunità sul modello di
quelle incontrate. Quello che faremo sarà entrare in contatto e
lavorare con persone che hanno già fatto questo tipo di scelta,
imparare da loro come si può organizzare la vita in modo diverso e
poi documentare, filmare e diffondere ciò che abbiamo imparato con
gli appunti, le foto ed i video che pubblicheremo regolarmente sul
blog. Questo per fare in modo che tutte le persone che ci hanno aiutato si sentano in viaggio insieme a noi, e possano poi raccontare ai loro figli di quella volta che hanno aiutato e seguito quei due folli in camper in giro per l'Europa. Al ritorno realizzeremo un documentario video sul nostro
viaggio e stamperemo un libro con gli estratti più significativi dai nostri diari di viaggio e con le foto più belle. Alla fine del viaggio troveremo un posto dove applicare le
conoscenze acquisite. Il
viaggio ci permetterà di creare una rete di collaborazione e diffusione
delle conoscenze tra le diverse comunità: questa rete sarà la base
sociale da cui partire per il nostro futuro progetto di vita<br/></p>

<b>Il
Progetto</b></p>
<p>
Nell'estate
2013 partiamo per la Romania insieme ad un fotografo comasco alla
ricerca delle ultime famiglie di rom tradizionali nomadi. Ne troviamo
alcune e ci fermiamo a vivere con loro per alcuni giorni. Una notte
di festa intorno al fuoco nasce l'idea di abbandonare la vita
stanziale per iniziare questo viaggio di ricerca itinerante.</p>
<p>Durante l'inverno abbiamo letto ed assimilato molti libri scritti da studiosi della decrescita, ambientalisti,
esponenti del sustainable living, scienziati e biologi consci dello
stato disastroso del Pianeta, critici del modello consumistico
attuale, e anche di testimoni di un modo di vivere diverso ed
alternativo a quello della nostra società dei consumi. Abbiamo preso
coscienza della necessità di un cambio radicale nello stile di vita
per poter adattare le nostre esigenze a quelle del Pianeta in cui
viviamo ed alle società con cui conviviamo.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/834082/files/20140904104017-DSCF5192.jpg?1409852417"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>
Il
nostro progetto è pensato per tutti coloro che desiderano cambiare
vita, Partendo dalla
convinzione che le rivoluzioni cominciano con una goccia d'acqua,
abbiamo deciso di essere i primi a fare questo passo. Ci siamo chiesti: ""Che cosa posso fare per migliorare la mia vita e
quella del Pianeta"" ed abbiamo scelto di farlo in prima persona. <br/></p>
<p>Non vogliamo creare la nostra piccola isola felice e disinteressarci dei problemi del mondo, ma tutto al contrario vogliamo dare il buon esempio, cominciare da dove si può, per non stare solo fermi a guardare bensì agire in prima persona.</p>
<p>
ll nostro progetto è un master di studio pratico ed
un terreno di ricerca sociale. Concentreremo i nostri sforzi per:</p>
<p>
1)
imparare le tecniche di produzione agricola (tecniche orticole,
agricoltura sinergica, permacoltura, compostaggio, fitodepurazione).</p>
<p>
2)
imparare a fabbricare utensili e strutture utili (forno solare,
compost toilet, forno in argilla ecc.).</p>
<p>
3)
analizzare come le diverse comunità organizzano la loro vita sociale (metodo decisionale, suddivisione del lavoro, gestione finanziaria).</p>
<p>
4)
studiare quale cammino educativo queste comunità hanno messo in
pratica per i loro figli.</p>
<p>
5)
imparare una nuova organizzazione di vita nel rispetto e nella
conservazione della biosfera (riduzione dell'impronta ecologica e dei consumi, riciclo e riutilizzo materiali, conservazione capitale naturale).</p>
<p>
6)
imparare, preservare e diffondere antiche conoscenze legate ad un
sistema non consumistico.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Obiettivi della ricerca</b><br/></p><p>Alla fine del nostro percorso elaboreremo uno studio di fattibilità di una comunità resistente, sviluppando ed approfondendo lungo il nostro percorso cinque punti chiave che ci siamo prefissati di analizzare nella nostra ricerca</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/889925/files/20140929080201-Comunit__resistente.mm3.jpg?1412002921"" src="""" style=""width: 736.736px; height: 568px;""/></p><br/><p><b>Organizzazione</b></p><p>Analizzeremo come queste comunità organizzano la loro<b> vita in comune</b>, quindi la gestione degli<b> spazi comuni</b> quali cucina, sala giochi, pasti, lavanderia.

Questo attraverso la <b>differenziazione delle attività</b>, in quanto il presupposto è che quanto più una comunità è specializzata tanto meno è in grado di gestire le difficoltà. La resilienza è basata anche slla <b>collaborazione con le altre comunità</b> del territorio e sulla rete con le comunità al di fuori di esso. Considereremo quali tecniche usano per <b>restituire </b>il <b>capitale naturale</b>, tecniche che potrebbero includere la <b>piantumazione</b> degli alberi, il <b>compostaggio</b> e la preservazione dell'humus, e vari metodi di<b> riciclo e riuso</b> dei materiali.<br/></p><p><b>Saperi tradizionali</b></p><p>Riteniamo che una comunità resistente debba riservare spazio alla scoperta ed allo sviluppo dei saperi tradizionali, attraverso un <b>recupero della cultura dei vecchi</b> ed uno stretto<b> contatto con il territorio</b> in cui sono. Questo prima che queste conoscenze scompaiano dalla memoria collettiva.</p><p><b>Autosufficienza</b></p><p>E' importante che queste comunità tendano all'autosufficienza, in primo luogo quella alimentare, legata alla <b>produzione di cibo</b>, che deve essere un'integrazione di orticoltura, seminativi, frutta e d allevamento. Altrettanto importante è l'autosufficienza <b>energetica</b>, che deve essere legata a piccoli sistemi integrati fra loro (microeolico, piccolo fotovoltaico, forni solari ecc). Infine l'autosufficienza è necessariamente legata all'<b>autoproduzione di utensili</b> e strutture.</p><p><b>Educazione</b></p><p>Una parte fondamentale del nostro studio riguarderà l'educazione, che dovrebbe essere pensata nel senso classico del termine: la paideia greca, cioè l'educazione alla cittadinanza. Innanzitutto l'educazione dei figli deve essere<b> riconcettualizzata</b> in modo che si rivaluti e si insegni lo<b> spirito del dono</b>, alla base della convivialità necessaria per la vita comune, e l'<b>etica della natura</b>, cioè la conservazione e la cura del capitale naturale. Studieremo quindi come queste comunità organizzano in pratica l'educazione dei bambini tramite <b>laboratori pedagogici</b>, <b>homeschooling</b> e come integrano queste attività con la<b> scuola tradizionale</b>. Visiteremo comunità con bambini perchè questo viaggio risulti un percorso educativo per la nostra bambina. Abbiamo scelto le comunità dove ci sono bambini per permettere a Maelia il confronto e la socializzazione con i suoi pari.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>

<b>Dove
come quando e perchè, o i luoghi dove vogliamo fermarci ed imparare</b></p>
<p>
Perchè
nomadi? In molti ci hanno posto questa domanda. Potremmo imparare molte di queste cose senza spostarci troppo dalla nostra città natale. Indubbiamente i costi e i problemi si
ridurrebbero molto, ma anche la ricchezza dell'esperienza. Abbiamo scelto di essere ricercatori itineranti:</p>
<p>
1)
Perchè pensiamo che il confronto tra diverse realtà arricchirà la nostra esperienza.</p><p>2) Perchè pensiamo che il viaggio rappresenti un'occasione unica per la nostra bambina di crescere ed imparare da nuove esperienze.<br/></p>
<p>
3)
Perchè lavorando a contatto con diverse realtà potremo creare una rete
locale, nazionale e internazionale di conoscenze e di collaborazione
futura.</p>
<p>
4)
Perchè abbiamo letto numerose testimonianze di chi ha scelto una
vita di resistenza e moltissimi lamentano un doloroso isolamento:
speriamo di superarlo e di creare invece una fitta e viva rete umana
di reciproco aiuto e di mutuo scambio.</p>
<p>
5)
Perchè è tramite il viaggio e la conoscenza di realtà lontane e
differenti tra loro che si possono notare e scoprire punti di forza e
di debolezza, che si possono cogliere i lati migliori, che si possono
apprendere le più geniali strategie di vita.</p>
<p>
Qui
di seguito una lista dei luoghi che visiteremo durante gli anni di
ricerca, la lista ovviamente, come in ogni ricerca sul campo, potrebbe essere riorientata in corso d'opera.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/836368/files/20140905090009-preprod.jpg?1409932809"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>

<h4><i>
A rambling research journey of discovery among resistants to 
modernity. Two anthropologists not yet famous want to learn, record and 
spread a new but old way of life. Rediscover ancient wisdom and skills, 
get back to working with their hands, finding a balance with the planet.</i></h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>What we want to do.</h4>
Our research project is an exploring journey. We will cross Europe 
with our notebooks, our pc, photo and video cameras to discover farm 
communities, eco-villages and families who have chosen to resist 
modernity and lead a life less tied to the consumer system. By 
sharing work we will learn what we think will be useful  the day we 
decide to stop being nomads and to build a community on the model of 
those encountered. <br/><br/><p>What we will do is get in touch and work with 
people who have already made this kind of choice, learn from them how 
you can organize your life in a different way and then document, film 
and spread what we have learned with notes, photos and videos that we 
will post regularly on the blog. This is to make all the people who helped us feel on the road with us, and then one day they can tell their children about that time when they have helped and followed those two fools in camper around Europe. On the way back we will release a video
 documentary of our trip and we will print a book with the best pictures
 and quotes from our road trip journal. </p>
<p>At the end of the trip we will find a place to apply their knowledge 
and begin our lives as resistants. The trip will allow us to create a 
network of cooperation and knowledge between different communities: this
 network will be the social  base to project our future life.</p>

<p><b>The project.</b></p>
<p>In the summer of 2013 we went to Romania together with a photographer
 looking for the last traditional nomadic Roma families. We found some 
and we stopped to live with them for a few days. During a night party by
 the campfire we decided to abandon the settled life to begin this 
journey of travel and discovery.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/834113/files/20140904105430-DSCF5992.jpg?1409853270"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>During the winter we have been reading many books written by scholars
 of degrowth, environmentalists, representatives of sustainable living, 
scientists and biologists. All these people are aware of the dire state 
of the planet, they are critics of the current consumer model, and also 
witness a different way of living, an alternative way to our consumer 
society. We have become aware of the need for a radical change in 
lifestyle to fit our needs to those of the planet in which we live in.

</p>
<p>Our project is designed for those who wish to change their lives.  Based on the 
conviction that revolutions begin with a drop of water, we decided to be
 the first to take this step. We asked ourselves, ""What can we do to 
improve our lives and that of the planet?"" and we decided to do it in 
the first person.</p>
We do not want to create our
 own little happy island and start to ignore the world's problems, but 
on the contrary we want to give the good example and start doing what we
 can. We don't want to stay still doing nothing, but on the contrary we
 want to start working with our hands.<p></p>
<p>Our project is  a master of practical studies and a social researching field.</p>
<p>We will focus on:</p>
<p>1) learning the techniques of agricultural production (horticultural 
techniques, synergistic agriculture, permaculture, composting, 
phytodepuration) </p>
<p>2) learning how to make tools and eco-facilities (solar oven, compost toilet, clay oven etc.)</p>
<p>3) analyzing how different communities organize their social life (decision-making, work division, financial management). </p>
<p>4) studying the educational paths that these communities have chosen for their children.</p>
<p>5) learning a new life organization in the respect and preservation 
of the biosphere (reduction of the ecological footprint and consumption,
 recycling and reusing materials, conservation of natural capital). </p>
<p>6) learning, preserving and spreading ancient knowledge related to a non-consumption system.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/834509/files/20140904134552-LW1I1331.jpg?1409863552"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p><b>Where, when, how and why, or the places where we want to stop and learn. </b></p>
<p>Why nomads? Many people have asked us this question. We could learn 
many of these things without moving too far from our hometown. 
Undoubtedly costs and problems would be reduced a lot, but so would the 
richness of the experience. We chose to be itinerant researchers: </p>
<p>1) Because we do think that the comparison among different realities will enrich so much our experience.</p>
<p>2) Because working on different experiences can create a local, 
national and international network of knowledge and future cooperation. 
 
</p>
<p>3) Because we read numerous stories of those who have chosen this 
kind of existence and many complain about isolation: we hope to overcome
 it and to instead create a dense and lively human network of mutual aid
 and mutual exchange</p>
<p>4) Because it is by travelling and getting to know distant and 
different realities that we can see and discover the strengths and 
weaknesses of all of them. It's the best way to catch the best side of 
things, the best way to learn the most brilliant life strategies. </p>
<p>Below is a list of the places we will visit during the years of 
research, the list of course, as in any field research, could be 
redirected during the work in progress.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/836378/files/20140905090432-preprod.jpg?1409933072"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>Where to.</b></p>

<p>1. Our home will be the camper van.</p>

<p>4. We will spread through the internet everything we will learn and we will keep you up to date on what are taught. </p>
<p>5. Any supporter will come with us: we write everyone's name on the camper truck.</p>
<p>6. We will work hard, we will not forget that this journey is a great opportunity of work.</p>
<p>7. We will follow the seasonal cycle. </p>
<p>8. We will move among different situations to know the limits and strengths and learn from each of them. </p>
<p>9. At the end of the trip we will create a documentary video. It will
 be our biggest thanks to all the supporters and a way to make all the 
supporters just like as they are travelling with us. </p>

Un
viaggio di ricerca nomade attraverso i resistenti alla modernità. Due
antropologi non ancora famosi che vogliono imparare, documentare e
diffondere un nuovo ma antico modo di vivere. Riscoprire antichi
saperi, ricominciare a lavorare con le mani, ritrovare un equilibrio
con il Pianeta.


Cosa
vogliamo fare

Il
nostro è un progetto di ricerca itinerante, un viaggio di
(ri)scoperta. Attraverseremo l'Europa con i nostri taccuini, il
nostro pc, foto e videocamera per scoprire comunità agricole,
ecovillaggi e famiglie che hanno scelto di resistere alla modernità
e condurre una vita meno legata al sistema consumistico.  Vogliamo analizzare e documentare quali strategie queste comunità adottano per organizzare la loro vita resistente.Tramite la condivisione del lavoro impareremo
ciò che pensiamo possa tornare utile il giorno che decideremo di
smettere di essere nomadi e di costruire una comunità sul modello di
quelle incontrate. Quello che faremo sarà entrare in contatto e
lavorare con persone che hanno già fatto questo tipo di scelta,
imparare da loro come si può organizzare la vita in modo diverso e
poi documentare, filmare e diffondere ciò che abbiamo imparato con
gli appunti, le foto ed i video che pubblicheremo regolarmente sul
blog. Questo per fare in modo che tutte le persone che ci hanno aiutato si sentano in viaggio insieme a noi, e possano poi raccontare ai loro figli di quella volta che hanno aiutato e seguito quei due folli in camper in giro per l'Europa. Al ritorno realizzeremo un documentario video sul nostro
viaggio e stamperemo un libro con gli estratti più significativi dai nostri diari di viaggio e con le foto più belle. Alla fine del viaggio troveremo un posto dove applicare le
conoscenze acquisite. Il
viaggio ci permetterà di creare una rete di collaborazione e diffusione
delle conoscenze tra le diverse comunità: questa rete sarà la base
sociale da cui partire per il nostro futuro progetto di vita
I folli aprono le strade che poi i prudenti seguiranno.

Il
Progetto

Nell'estate
2013 partiamo per la Romania insieme ad un fotografo comasco alla
ricerca delle ultime famiglie di rom tradizionali nomadi. Ne troviamo
alcune e ci fermiamo a vivere con loro per alcuni giorni. Una notte
di festa intorno al fuoco nasce l'idea di abbandonare la vita
stanziale per iniziare questo viaggio di ricerca itinerante.
Durante l'inverno abbiamo letto ed assimilato molti libri scritti da studiosi della decrescita, ambientalisti,
esponenti del sustainable living, scienziati e biologi consci dello
stato disastroso del Pianeta, critici del modello consumistico
attuale, e anche di testimoni di un modo di vivere diverso ed
alternativo a quello della nostra società dei consumi. Abbiamo preso
coscienza della necessità di un cambio radicale nello stile di vita
per poter adattare le nostre esigenze a quelle del Pianeta in cui
viviamo ed alle società con cui conviviamo.
Il
nostro progetto è pensato per tutti coloro che desiderano cambiare
vita, Partendo dalla
convinzione che le rivoluzioni cominciano con una goccia d'acqua,
abbiamo deciso di essere i primi a fare questo passo. Ci siamo chiesti: ""Che cosa posso fare per migliorare la mia vita e
quella del Pianeta"" ed abbiamo scelto di farlo in prima persona. 
Non vogliamo creare la nostra piccola isola felice e disinteressarci dei problemi del mondo, ma tutto al contrario vogliamo dare il buon esempio, cominciare da dove si può, per non stare solo fermi a guardare bensì agire in prima persona.

ll nostro progetto è un master di studio pratico ed
un terreno di ricerca sociale. Concentreremo i nostri sforzi per:

1)
imparare le tecniche di produzione agricola (tecniche orticole,
agricoltura sinergica, permacoltura, compostaggio, fitodepurazione).

2)
imparare a fabbricare utensili e strutture utili (forno solare,
compost toilet, forno in argilla ecc.).

3)
analizzare come le diverse comunità organizzano la loro vita sociale (metodo decisionale, suddivisione del lavoro, gestione finanziaria).

4)
studiare quale cammino educativo queste comunità hanno messo in
pratica per i loro figli.

5)
imparare una nuova organizzazione di vita nel rispetto e nella
conservazione della biosfera (riduzione dell'impronta ecologica e dei consumi, riciclo e riutilizzo materiali, conservazione capitale naturale).

6)
imparare, preservare e diffondere antiche conoscenze legate ad un
sistema non consumistico.Obiettivi della ricercaAlla fine del nostro percorso elaboreremo uno studio di fattibilità di una comunità resistente, sviluppando ed approfondendo lungo il nostro percorso cinque punti chiave che ci siamo prefissati di analizzare nella nostra ricercaOrganizzazioneAnalizzeremo come queste comunità organizzano la loro vita in comune, quindi la gestione degli spazi comuni quali cucina, sala giochi, pasti, lavanderia. Riteniamo importante che le comunità siano impostate sulla condivisione. Verranno approfonditi anche i metodi decisionali legati al lavoro che riteniamo dovrebbero essere basati sul consenso, e la suddivisione dei compiti, che dovrebbe essere equa e rispettare non solo le capacità ma anche i desideri di ciascuno.SostenibilitàEsamineremo la resilienza di queste comunità, cioè la loro capacita di adattamento alle diverse circostanze climatiche, sociali ed economiche. Questo attraverso la differenziazione delle attività, in quanto il presupposto è che quanto più una comunità è specializzata tanto meno è in grado di gestire le difficoltà. La resilienza è basata anche slla collaborazione con le altre comunità del territorio e sulla rete con le comunità al di fuori di esso. Considereremo quali tecniche usano per restituire il capitale naturale, tecniche che potrebbero includere la piantumazione degli alberi, il compostaggio e la preservazione dell'humus, e vari metodi di riciclo e riuso dei materiali.Saperi tradizionaliRiteniamo che una comunità resistente debba riservare spazio alla scoperta ed allo sviluppo dei saperi tradizionali, attraverso un recupero della cultura dei vecchi ed uno stretto contatto con il territorio in cui sono. Questo prima che queste conoscenze scompaiano dalla memoria collettiva.AutosufficienzaE' importante che queste comunità tendano all'autosufficienza, in primo luogo quella alimentare, legata alla produzione di cibo, che deve essere un'integrazione di orticoltura, seminativi, frutta e d allevamento. Altrettanto importante è l'autosufficienza energetica, che deve essere legata a piccoli sistemi integrati fra loro (microeolico, piccolo fotovoltaico, forni solari ecc). Infine l'autosufficienza è necessariamente legata all'autoproduzione di utensili e strutture.EducazioneUna parte fondamentale del nostro studio riguarderà l'educazione, che dovrebbe essere pensata nel senso classico del termine: la paideia greca, cioè l'educazione alla cittadinanza. Innanzitutto l'educazione dei figli deve essere riconcettualizzata in modo che si rivaluti e si insegni lo spirito del dono, alla base della convivialità necessaria per la vita comune, e l'etica della natura, cioè la conservazione e la cura del capitale naturale. Studieremo quindi come queste comunità organizzano in pratica l'educazione dei bambini tramite laboratori pedagogici, homeschooling e come integrano queste attività con la scuola tradizionale. Visiteremo comunità con bambini perchè questo viaggio risulti un percorso educativo per la nostra bambina. Abbiamo scelto le comunità dove ci sono bambini per permettere a Maelia il confronto e la socializzazione con i suoi pari.

Dove
come quando e perchè, o i luoghi dove vogliamo fermarci ed imparare

Perchè
nomadi? In molti ci hanno posto questa domanda. Potremmo imparare molte di queste cose senza spostarci troppo dalla nostra città natale. Indubbiamente i costi e i problemi si
ridurrebbero molto, ma anche la ricchezza dell'esperienza. Abbiamo scelto di essere ricercatori itineranti:

1)
Perchè pensiamo che il confronto tra diverse realtà arricchirà la nostra esperienza.2) Perchè pensiamo che il viaggio rappresenti un'occasione unica per la nostra bambina di crescere ed imparare da nuove esperienze.

3)
Perchè lavorando a contatto con diverse realtà potremo creare una rete
locale, nazionale e internazionale di conoscenze e di collaborazione
futura.

4)
Perchè abbiamo letto numerose testimonianze di chi ha scelto una
vita di resistenza e moltissimi lamentano un doloroso isolamento:
speriamo di superarlo e di creare invece una fitta e viva rete umana
di reciproco aiuto e di mutuo scambio.

5)
Perchè è tramite il viaggio e la conoscenza di realtà lontane e
differenti tra loro che si possono notare e scoprire punti di forza e
di debolezza, che si possono cogliere i lati migliori, che si possono
apprendere le più geniali strategie di vita.

Qui
di seguito una lista dei luoghi che visiteremo durante gli anni di
ricerca, la lista ovviamente, come in ogni ricerca sul campo, potrebbe essere riorientata in corso d'opera.

BAREFOOT RAMBLERS




A rambling research journey of discovery among resistants to 
modernity. Two anthropologists not yet famous want to learn, record and 
spread a new but old way of life. Rediscover ancient wisdom and skills, 
get back to working with their hands, finding a balance with the planet.


What we want to do.
Our research project is an exploring journey. We will cross Europe 
with our notebooks, our pc, photo and video cameras to discover farm 
communities, eco-villages and families who have chosen to resist 
modernity and lead a life less tied to the consumer system. By 
sharing work we will learn what we think will be useful  the day we 
decide to stop being nomads and to build a community on the model of 
those encountered. What we will do is get in touch and work with 
people who have already made this kind of choice, learn from them how 
you can organize your life in a different way and then document, film 
and spread what we have learned with notes, photos and videos that we 
will post regularly on the blog. This is to make all the people who helped us feel on the road with us, and then one day they can tell their children about that time when they have helped and followed those two fools in camper around Europe. On the way back we will release a video
 documentary of our trip and we will print a book with the best pictures
 and quotes from our road trip journal. 
At the end of the trip we will find a place to apply their knowledge 
and begin our lives as resistants. The trip will allow us to create a 
network of cooperation and knowledge between different communities: this
 network will be the social  base to project our future life.

Fools open roads which cautious will follow.



Who we are.-Andrea Nasi Anthropologist expert in Gypsy studies. Thesis on
 the impact of modern society on traditional Roma culture. Researcher 
for Terre des Hommes in Romania. Collaboration and writing projects for 
several local and international NGOs operating in Eastern Europe with 
the Roma populations. Social worker in a company that works for rights 
and integration of Roma people.-Veronica Testa Africanist anthropologist. Thesis on the rites of
 passage into adulthood among Kabiyè of northern Togo and their 
modifications brought by the Catholic Church. With a ""kot à projet"" 
management and organization of events aimed at knowledge of the cultures
 of Africa during the three years of university studies in 
Belgium. Social worker in a company that works for rights and 
integration of Roma people.-Maelia Solim Marvellous girl of nearly three years. She attended
 one year of kindergarden, which she loved. She  wants to grow and learn
 with family. She wants to fill her eyes and her hands with real life. 
Sociable, nomadism-lover and camper-lover.
The project.
In the summer of 2013 we went to Romania together with a photographer
 looking for the last traditional nomadic Roma families. We found some 
and we stopped to live with them for a few days. During a night party by
 the campfire we decided to abandon the settled life to begin this 
journey of travel and discovery.During the winter we have been reading many books written by scholars
 of degrowth, environmentalists, representatives of sustainable living, 
scientists and biologists. All these people are aware of the dire state 
of the planet, they are critics of the current consumer model, and also 
witness a different way of living, an alternative way to our consumer 
society. We have become aware of the need for a radical change in 
lifestyle to fit our needs to those of the planet in which we live in.


Our project is designed for those who wish to change their lives.  Based on the 
conviction that revolutions begin with a drop of water, we decided to be
 the first to take this step. We asked ourselves, ""What can we do to 
improve our lives and that of the planet?"" and we decided to do it in 
the first person.
We do not want to create our
 own little happy island and start to ignore the world's problems, but 
on the contrary we want to give the good example and start doing what we
 can. We don't want to stay still doing nothing, but on the contrary we
 want to start working with our hands.
Our project is  a master of practical studies and a social researching field.
We will focus on:
1) learning the techniques of agricultural production (horticultural 
techniques, synergistic agriculture, permaculture, composting, 
phytodepuration) 
2) learning how to make tools and eco-facilities (solar oven, compost toilet, clay oven etc.)
3) analyzing how different communities organize their social life (decision-making, work division, financial management). 
4) studying the educational paths that these communities have chosen for their children.
5) learning a new life organization in the respect and preservation 
of the biosphere (reduction of the ecological footprint and consumption,
 recycling and reusing materials, conservation of natural capital). 
6) learning, preserving and spreading ancient knowledge related to a non-consumption system.
Where, when, how and why, or the places where we want to stop and learn. 
Why nomads? Many people have asked us this question. We could learn 
many of these things without moving too far from our hometown. 
Undoubtedly costs and problems would be reduced a lot, but so would the 
richness of the experience. We chose to be itinerant researchers: 
1) Because we do think that the comparison among different realities will enrich so much our experience.
2) Because working on different experiences can create a local, 
national and international network of knowledge and future cooperation. 
 

3) Because we read numerous stories of those who have chosen this 
kind of existence and many complain about isolation: we hope to overcome
 it and to instead create a dense and lively human network of mutual aid
 and mutual exchange
4) Because it is by travelling and getting to know distant and 
different realities that we can see and discover the strengths and 
weaknesses of all of them. It's the best way to catch the best side of 
things, the best way to learn the most brilliant life strategies. 
Below is a list of the places we will visit during the years of 
research, the list of course, as in any field research, could be 
redirected during the work in progress.Where to.

2. We will spend as little as possible by leaning on the hospitality 
of the communities we study. Everything that will be offered we will 
trade for handwork. The wwoofing network will be the favourite. 
3. We will do waste sorting, recycling and reusing. 
4. We will spread through the internet everything we will learn and we will keep you up to date on what are taught. 
5. Any supporter will come with us: we write everyone's name on the camper truck.
6. We will work hard, we will not forget that this journey is a great opportunity of work.
7. We will follow the seasonal cycle. 
8. We will move among different situations to know the limits and strengths and learn from each of them. 
9. At the end of the trip we will create a documentary video. It will
 be our biggest thanks to all the supporters and a way to make all the 
supporters just like as they are travelling with us. 
10. We will follow a vegetarian diet.
Bucks...


What do we need them for?We do not have sponsors for our project, therefore we will invest all
 our savings to make it come true. With our savings we will be able to 
face the majority of our life's expenses during the years of travel. It 
will be years marked by simplicity and reduction of costs.

what we are still missing to be able to actually go and leave: the 
camper in the picture above, a wonderful 1982 Mercedes 407, the camera and a laptop. Any other fund that will come exceeding our goal will be spent to buy the equipment to travel. Even in the purchase of 
these items we will maintain our commitment to minimize expenses. 
Camper van: 4000 eurosCamera and laptop: 500 Euro If we reach our goal every cent over 4500 euro will be spent for: tool kit, gas bottles, camper parts, first aid kit, sleeping bags, flashlights, compass, maps, work clothes, trekking shoes and, of course, fuel and highway fees...How to contribute:If you want to donate by credit card without opening a PayPal

YOU SO MUCH and STAY SPICY!</p><p></p></div>","Do you love popcorn? Love spices?I do and hope you do too! Hello, my name is Mihir Shah, the founder of Dishoom
Foods. Thank you for checking out our campaign.I am passionate about natural foods, spices and their health benefits.
As a childhood cancer survivor, the
long-term side effects from the intense medications caused a host of serious
health issues including blindness and heart failure. I've since overcome them
all and feel fantastic, but because of my experience, I’m proud to offer an all-natural snack for those just as passionate about staying away from Genetically Modified  Organisms (GMO), added chemicals and artificial flavors.  
When I was young, my Mom would go nuts whenever I ate overly
processed snacks. She’d say, “Why do these snack companies add all these
chemicals and artificial ingredients when you can get flavors and colors
straight from nature??!!”
Years
later, my Mom mixed good-for-you, flavorful spices such as turmeric,
cayenne, and cumin and cooked them with popcorn. I was instantly hooked! But
don't take my word on how delicious it is, see our testimonials.My
mom’s popcorn later became our Cobra Corn Bombay Seasoning—our most popular
flavor. Since our humble founding in 2010,  we have created some  fabulously delicious flavors beyond the
current Indian inspired line.  In order
to reflect the more globally-focused flavors, and our strong belief in using
the best available, REAL spices, we are rebranding our products from Cobra Corn
to Spiced & Infused.Our products fill a void in the
snack aisle by offering an all-American favorite—popcorn--with good-for-you, REAL spices that have healthful attributes. Take a look at some of the spices we use and their benefits here: http://cobracorn.com/our-spices. We are asking for your help so we can bring more healthful spices to the snack aisle by creating new flavors and appeal to more people. 
So if you
contribute today, you can help bring Cobra Corn to the masses and be the
first to get our Spiced & Infused popcorn available in these flavors: Asian
Barbeque, Bombay Seasoning, Chipotle Taco, French Herb, and Himalayan Salt.What we will do with the funds...
Specifically,
we aim to raise $50,000 in order to:
· Obtain official certifications for gluten-free, non-GMO, vegan, and
whole grain
· Redesign our packaging with our new brand and create single serve and
family size bags
· Formulate new and delectable flavors including: French Herb, Chipotle
Taco, and Asian Barbeque to appeal to more palates and spread the spice love

<h3>Help! Transition is Expensive!</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Maypop! You may know me because you've seen me get loud on the internet, look fierce at a dance party or attended one of my charming brunches. Here's the thing: I'm a transwoman, which means I was assigned male at birth and have been spending the last 23 years attempting to correct that error. After beginning hormone treatment over a year ago, it's finally come time for one of the biggest steps in my journey: top surgery, a.k.a breast augmentation. This surgery will help my body become much closer to my identity, my dysphoria be eased, and in general benefit my ability to exist in this world. It's a win/win/win!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Here's what it'll take:</h3>
<p>This surgery will be a huge step toward getting my legal gender marker switched from M to F, which means a lot for my safety, psychological and social well-being. Insurance does not cover this sort of surgery, and I am painfully underemployed, so I'm gonna need help from my community: </p>
<ul>
<li>The surgery will cost about $6300</li>
<li>That cost covers operating room fees, anesthesia and the surgery itself</li>
<li>If I get $6000, I'll be able to cover the surgery, and the time off work I'll need to recover!</li>
<li>Any money beyond the cost of surgery, I'll donate to local rad queer and trans organizations! </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Give whatever you can! If every one of my facebook friends gave 11 dollars, the fundraising would end tomorrow! If you can't give any money, signal boost me! Share my link on your facebook wall, tumblr, twitter, whatever! This will help the process so much. </p>
<p>Help me get the body I can thrive in!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Perks!</h3>
<p><b>$10-25</b></p>
<p>Hugs! Literally, you can have all the hugs you want from me any time, all you have to do is ask and they're yours. </p>
<p><b>$25-50</b></p>
<p>An invite to my boob appreciation brunch! Once I get the dang things, I'll throw a brunch and cook a bunch of delicious food to celebrate with everyone who helped me get here.</p>
<p><b>$50-100</b></p>
<p>I will send you a tastefully trashy signed-in-lipstick pin up photo featuring the goodies themselves! This is the stuff that boudoir dreams are made of. </p>
<p><b>$100</b></p>
<p>You can request a specific pin up photo of your very own, featuring props and outfits of any kind! Also signed-in-lipstick. Also you can be in the photo if you want.</p>
<p><b>200$</b></p>
<p>In addition to fulfilling all of the perks above for you, I'll also do your makeup for the special event of your choice. I'm actually kinda good at makeup so this could be really cool for you. </p>

I started making rods and lures for myself and friends, it snowballed into a few people here and there. I decided to make a site and post my work on Instagram, the success has been pretty awesome. My next step is to be able to order material and supplies ahead of time and in bulk to keep prices down, and to not rely on orders coming in to fund material. Im about getting a product I would use out to people as fast as possible. Having the material already helps with that.What We Need & What You Get$2500 is my goalOut perks include 2x7 stickers, limited run handmade hoodies, custom painted lures, and 5 custom made 7' split grip freshwater rods. I'm the only one in the company, customers deal directly with me, the money goes towards ordering tools, paint, blanks, all material for the vast amount of custom items i offerThe ImpactYour donations and help to spread the word will help me continue doing what I love and help me do it better and cheaper for the customer. Theres nothing like building something and seeing somebody catch a fish on something you created. Like I said I am a bit of a nut for fishing.Other Ways You Can HelpFirst off, thank you for taking the time to read this.

<p>Greetings, my name is KJ Dakin. I am
a Canadian photojournalist and writer, currently working on stories about
Syrian refugees in Turkey. </p>
<p>For nearly a decade I have had the
privilege of living and maintaining connections with people and communities in
Latin America. I have spent a combined total of about three years between
Mexico and Peru, predominantly in Colombia, Nicaragua, Peru, Haiti and Costa
Rica.</p>
<p>This January I return to the region and
join my skills as a photojournalist and journalist to those of my talented
comrade,Trina
Moyles, a fellow writer and humanitarian. We will document the first chapters
of a book about some of the world’s most determined, practical and
misunderstood people – the women who farm in “developing” nations. </p>
<p>These are women who farm not only to feed
themselves but also their communities; all the while striving against
incredible economic and sexual inequality. Often they are literally barefoot and
pregnant, with massive transnational resource companies buying their land out
from under them even as they battle insidious GMO crops that are infecting
their own.</p><p>                </p><p>           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/265847/files/20131217085604-Mostar_kids_play_concrete.jpg?1387299364"" src="""" style=""width: 476px; height: 357px;""/></p><p></p> <p></p>
<p>The book<i>, Small,</i> is the vision of Moyles, whose words I will be adding my
visual voice to as a photojournalist. </p>
<p>Trina Moyles is well into the
research of the book and has interviewed more than 50 farmers already.</p>
<p>“…when you add up the number of women farmers worldwide,
you begin to realize they’re the ones ‘doing the work’ while barefoot and
holding a hand-hoe, and quite possibly, eight months pregnant. They're proving
that ""small"" is much more localized, sustainable and effective than ""big
policy and big dollars. Yet the challenges women farmers are facing, worldwide
are enormous,” wrote
Moyles on her indiegogo page. To see more about her book in her own words,
check out her page; <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/small-stories-of-women-farmers-who-are-changing-the-world"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/small-stories-of-women-farmers-who-are-changing-the-world</a>  .</p>
<p>My part in this project will be to
illustrate the information and personal stories Moyles tells and to provide
greater context and understanding through the medium of photography. </p>
<p>To bring visually compelling storytelling
to the narrative of these strong, capable women who are taking charge, not only
of their own lives but of their larger communities. </p>
<p>I will also take the opportunity to
write current and timely articles from a journalistic perspective and work to
have them published in public media, to bring attention to the issues.</p><p>                  </p><p>         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/265898/files/20131217091909-Reyhanli_house__1_of_3_.jpg?1387300749"" src="""" style=""width: 500.44602272727275px; height: 333px;""/></p>                  <p></p> <p></p>
<h1>Documenting the realities of foreign
resource companies in developing nations</h1>
<p>While my primary focus over these two-weeks
will be on illustrating <i>Small, </i>it is
also the beginning of a much larger documentation project that I have been
working towards for years.</p>
<p>I will be returning to Latin America in the
summer of 2014 to document the issue of foreign resource companies
(particularly Canadian ones) and the consequences and challenges that result
from their presence.</p>
<p>Over the last ten years Colombia has seen
massive changes as the government has altered laws to promote international
mining in the country while effectively making small-scale, self sustaining
mining by individuals and families illegal. </p>
<p>As a very
timely example of the challenges these people and countries face, the Costa
Rican government may face a $1 billion dollar fine from a Canadian mining
company, Infinito Gold, after it denied permission to the company to begin an
open-pit mine to the country’s north. </p>
<p>The subject of foreign resource companies
is finally being discussed in some media outlets in Canada, however there is a
much greater need for thorough documentation,  both photographic and written, of how they
truly affect the people and environment they operate in. </p><p>        </p><p>                      </p><p>         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/268275/files/20131218125943-_DSC8437.jpg?1387400383"" src="""" style=""width: 495.0520231213873px; height: 366px;""/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">   </span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<h1>Accountability</h1>
<p>While I am new to freelancing, until
earlier this year I worked at the Prince Albert Daily Herald in Canada where I
was expected to write and photograph several stories a week. As a freelancer I
was recently published in Al Jazeera America with an article and a 10-page
photo spread, looking at Syrian refugees recovering from wounds in southern
Turkey. <a href=""http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/4/a-house-of-healinginturkeyforthosewoundedinsyria.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/4/a-house-of-healinginturkeyforthosewoundedinsyria.html</a></p>
<p>I have also researched the subject of
Canadian mining companies in Central America and Colombia and wrote an article
a couple of years ago about Gold Corp in Central America.</p>
<p>I’m campaigning to raise $1500 to
help me fund the trip to Nicaragua and Guatemala in early 2014, where I will
work to capture the individual women and their communities that will be
featured in <i>Small</i>. I will also write
articles and submit them for publishing by public media outlets. If there is no
interest, than they will at least be published online as part of The Bean Tree
blog; <a href=""http://www.thebeantree.org/blog.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thebeantree.org/blog.html</a></p>
<p>Specifically, fundraising will cover:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Portion of flights to and within
Central America (Nicaragua &amp; Guatemala) – $800</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Portion of on-land transport to rural
locations and food –
$300</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Portion of logistic &amp; translation

<p>·<span> 
</span>Portion of gear – (batteries,
waterproof camera bag, recorder, SD cards) – $100</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Portion of insurance for gear – $200</p><p></p><p>      </p><p></p><p>          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/268290/files/20131218131155-Foundry_scholarship-89.jpg?1387401115"" src="""" style=""width: 491.213768115942px; height: 275px;""/></p><p></p><h1><br/></h1><h1>The Plan: 2014 –

<p>July – August: Return to Guatemala
and Colombia to work on stories and photo-documentation of the effects of
foreign resource companies. </p>
<p>2014 – 2015 the writing, editing and
completion of<i> Small</i> to be published
in 2015. See Moyles’ page for more details; <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/small-stories-of-women-farmers-who-are-changing-the-world"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/small-stories-of-women-farmers-who-are-changing-the-world</a></p>
<p>Those that know me have known of my
affection for and connection to Latin America and especially to Nicaragua and
Colombia for many years. They also know that I am a journalist now because of
this. They know I care about empowering people who are taking care of
themselves and their environment, while being confronted with
foreign interest companies with deep pockets and whose priorities are
never the people and environments left behind.</p>
<h1>Why fundraise? </h1>
<p>I left my job at the Prince Albert
Daily Herald last spring so that I could do the stories that I believe are important instead of the stories that my newspaper says are important.
As a freelancer that means paying my own way to get to the location and
covering all my own costs in the hopes that I can sell a story after I have taken all of the financial and personal risks myself. I am
perfectly okay with doing that, but the reality is I have spent the entirety of
my savings while working in Turkey and I have no funds to spare to get me to
Central America. </p>
<h1>What’s the Impact? </h1>
<p>If you do not believe that there is
any point in looking at the world beyond your own backyard or in telling the
stories of people who will never have the opportunity to tell their own
stories, then there is no point in funding this project. </p>
<p>The purpose and point of journalism
and documentation can be argued about over a cup of coffee for hours and I will
be one of the first to raise my voice and say that I have doubts. That I do not
know if it really makes a difference. However I am compelled to do something.
To show what I see, to communicate the similarities and differences between
people and places in the hope that we will someday create a world of generosity
and patience, rather than fear and greed. </p>
<p>“Indifference, indifference is the
strongest force. It makes everything it touches meaningless. Love, hate, don’t
stand a chance against it. It lets neglect and decay and monstrous injustice go
unchecked. It doesn’t act, it allows. And that’s what gives it so much power.” Joan d Vinge, ‘The Snow
Queen’</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/265968/files/20131217094452-6_4_Haiti_B_W_House_destruction.jpg?1387302292"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>

Greetings, my name is KJ Dakin. I am
a Canadian photojournalist and writer, currently working on stories about
Syrian refugees in Turkey. 
For nearly a decade I have had the
privilege of living and maintaining connections with people and communities in
Latin America. I have spent a combined total of about three years between
Mexico and Peru, predominantly in Colombia, Nicaragua, Peru, Haiti and Costa
Rica.
This January I return to the region and
join my skills as a photojournalist and journalist to those of my talented
comrade,Trina
Moyles, a fellow writer and humanitarian. We will document the first chapters
of a book about some of the world’s most determined, practical and
misunderstood people – the women who farm in “developing” nations. 
These are women who farm not only to feed
themselves but also their communities; all the while striving against
incredible economic and sexual inequality. Often they are literally barefoot and
pregnant, with massive transnational resource companies buying their land out
from under them even as they battle insidious GMO crops that are infecting
their own.                            
The book, Small, is the vision of Moyles, whose words I will be adding my
visual voice to as a photojournalist. 
Trina Moyles is well into the
research of the book and has interviewed more than 50 farmers already.
“…when you add up the number of women farmers worldwide,
you begin to realize they’re the ones ‘doing the work’ while barefoot and
holding a hand-hoe, and quite possibly, eight months pregnant. They're proving
that ""small"" is much more localized, sustainable and effective than ""big
policy and big dollars. Yet the challenges women farmers are facing, worldwide
are enormous,” wrote
Moyles on her indiegogo page. To see more about her book in her own words,
check out her page; http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/small-stories-of-women-farmers-who-are-changing-the-world  .
My part in this project will be to
illustrate the information and personal stories Moyles tells and to provide
greater context and understanding through the medium of photography. 
To bring visually compelling storytelling
to the narrative of these strong, capable women who are taking charge, not only
of their own lives but of their larger communities. 
I will also take the opportunity to
write current and timely articles from a journalistic perspective and work to
have them published in public media, to bring attention to the issues.                                              
Documenting the realities of foreign
resource companies in developing nations
While my primary focus over these two-weeks
will be on illustrating Small, it is
also the beginning of a much larger documentation project that I have been
working towards for years.
I will be returning to Latin America in the
summer of 2014 to document the issue of foreign resource companies
(particularly Canadian ones) and the consequences and challenges that result
from their presence.
Over the last ten years Colombia has seen
massive changes as the government has altered laws to promote international
mining in the country while effectively making small-scale, self sustaining
mining by individuals and families illegal. 
As a very
timely example of the challenges these people and countries face, the Costa
Rican government may face a $1 billion dollar fine from a Canadian mining
company, Infinito Gold, after it denied permission to the company to begin an
open-pit mine to the country’s north. 
The subject of foreign resource companies
is finally being discussed in some media outlets in Canada, however there is a
much greater need for thorough documentation,  both photographic and written, of how they
truly affect the people and environment they operate in.                                           
Accountability
While I am new to freelancing, until
earlier this year I worked at the Prince Albert Daily Herald in Canada where I
was expected to write and photograph several stories a week. As a freelancer I
was recently published in Al Jazeera America with an article and a 10-page
photo spread, looking at Syrian refugees recovering from wounds in southern
Turkey. http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/4/a-house-of-healinginturkeyforthosewoundedinsyria.html
I have also researched the subject of
Canadian mining companies in Central America and Colombia and wrote an article
a couple of years ago about Gold Corp in Central America.
I’m campaigning to raise $1500 to
help me fund the trip to Nicaragua and Guatemala in early 2014, where I will
work to capture the individual women and their communities that will be
featured in Small. I will also write
articles and submit them for publishing by public media outlets. If there is no
interest, than they will at least be published online as part of The Bean Tree
blog; http://www.thebeantree.org/blog.html
Specifically, fundraising will cover:
· 
Portion of flights to and within
Central America (Nicaragua & Guatemala) – $800
· 
Portion of on-land transport to rural
locations and food –
$300
· 
Portion of logistic & translation
fees – $100
· 
Portion of gear – (batteries,
waterproof camera bag, recorder, SD cards) – $100
· 
Portion of insurance for gear – $200                The Plan: 2014 –
2015
January – March:Photographing subjects on location in Guatemala and Nicaragua, returning
to Canada to write articles and submit them for publishing. 
March – July:Go treeplanting to finance continuing project
on foreign resource companies in Central America and Colombia. 
July – August: Return to Guatemala
and Colombia to work on stories and photo-documentation of the effects of
foreign resource companies. 
2014 – 2015 the writing, editing and
completion of Small to be published
in 2015. See Moyles’ page for more details; http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/small-stories-of-women-farmers-who-are-changing-the-world
Those that know me have known of my
affection for and connection to Latin America and especially to Nicaragua and
Colombia for many years. They also know that I am a journalist now because of
this. They know I care about empowering people who are taking care of
themselves and their environment, while being confronted with
foreign interest companies with deep pockets and whose priorities are
never the people and environments left behind.
Why fundraise? 
I left my job at the Prince Albert
Daily Herald last spring so that I could do the stories that I believe are important instead of the stories that my newspaper says are important.
As a freelancer that means paying my own way to get to the location and
covering all my own costs in the hopes that I can sell a story after I have taken all of the financial and personal risks myself. I am
perfectly okay with doing that, but the reality is I have spent the entirety of
my savings while working in Turkey and I have no funds to spare to get me to
Central America. 
What’s the Impact? 
If you do not believe that there is
any point in looking at the world beyond your own backyard or in telling the
stories of people who will never have the opportunity to tell their own
stories, then there is no point in funding this project. 
The purpose and point of journalism
and documentation can be argued about over a cup of coffee for hours and I will
be one of the first to raise my voice and say that I have doubts. That I do not
know if it really makes a difference. However I am compelled to do something.
To show what I see, to communicate the similarities and differences between
people and places in the hope that we will someday create a world of generosity
and patience, rather than fear and greed. 
“Indifference, indifference is the
strongest force. It makes everything it touches meaningless. Love, hate, don’t
stand a chance against it. It lets neglect and decay and monstrous injustice go
unchecked. It doesn’t act, it allows. And that’s what gives it so much power.” Joan d Vinge, ‘The Snow
Queen’
Thank
you
If you are able to help out financially, thank you. If not, that is fine too. Pass it on to someone else who might
be inspired and thank you again for your time and consideration.

  The Impact The lives of women and children who have been through the trauma of homelessness are transformed at Women's Housing Coalition. By providing the stability of safe, affordable permanent housing, and supportive services, our women and families gain the skills and confidence to keep that stability for
themselves for the rest of their lives.
For

taking courses at Baltimore City Community College (BCCC). Before coming to the

have a dual purpose goal, it starts with our decision to go all
organic, and our drive to help the poor. We want to make organic
successful, but
not lose our humanity
in the process. So we have made the decision to give 1/10 of our
flock to the poor every year. This means that we will give 1
lamb out of every 10 lambs to the poor. So the goal is to make
organic run on 90% of its total income. The remaining 10% goes
to charity.</p><p></p><p>     Like
sheep we need the flock, we need to work as a community. The power of
our flock can change lives, it can give more to the community
in ways that one person possibly could. </p><p></p><p>     We have
seen communities step forward and change lives for the better. That
is our goal, to change lives for the better. We desire to help,
and to help those that are in need. For every 10 lambs that
come to our Ranch, we set aside one for charity. This female
sheep is dedicated as breeding stock for the
local charity, instead of her offspring going
to market, they are given to those who are in need:
the disabled,
low income seniors,
single mothers, veterans,
and organizations that distribute food to the hungry.  This
is who
we are for and the
causes we are dedicated

need to increase the operation that we already have. This means we
need to determine what it would take to be able to produce 10 lambs a
year for charity. </b></p>
<p>     It worked out
that you can support 10 sheep on 1 acre of good pasture land. So we
decided to separate the fundraiser into 10 parts. In essence we have
10 goals. </p><p></p><p>     </p><p>     1.
We needed to
determine the price per acre for land. After
doing a lot of research, we found
that it can be purchased for $5,000. (especially if we have cash to
offer.)</p><p></p><p>
     2.
We had to determine what it would cost to purchase the sheep. Sheep
in our area are going for somewhere around $200-$300 a lamb. The
price can vary, based on the breed of sheep. We have chosen
a Suffolk breed, it is common in our area, and is
affordable, considering how much meat this particular breed
produces. If we put 10 sheep on an acre that means 1 lamb for
the poor and 9 for the Ranch, that would put us around $3000 per
acre.</p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></span><span>
<p></p>
<p>     3.
Living costs etc... are going to be around $2000 per acre. If we buy
land, most
likely we will have to build the living quarters ourselves. This
cost will be low because Michael Mills will be doing all the labor.</p>

<p></p>
<p>     We
are a couple with 4 children, who are dedicated to their well being.
This makes our motivation to be all Organic even more important. This
adds accountability to our Ranch. 
We don't
use any chemical's even the most mild, as they could harm our
children's health. Both of our sons have developmental
disorders: the eldest of the boys (Joe) has Autistic Spectrum
Disorder and the second boy (Isaiah) has forms of Dyspraxia. Because
of their developmental delays, it is not wise to use even the mildest
chemical on our Ranch. This is one of the greatest reasons why we are
fully committed  to the organic, all natural movement, it is
because of our children, and
our commitment to those children that we can help.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>     We
have bills to pay just like you, so we feel for the average consumer.
We have 4 children to supply for, 2 with developmental disorders, and
1 that was a 7 month old preemie.
They all have special requirements, and they are all very precious to
us. We can't stress this point enough, we are not a typical business
or
corporation,
but a business run by real people that really care. Visit: <a href=""http://www.millsorganichills.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.millsorganichills.com</a> for more.</p></span><p></p><p><br/></p>

We
are dedicated to helping others afford the food they need most. The
next step in the availability of organic food for the average person,
is helping your local farmer. Give
us what we need to help others.Note: we are not a non-profit organisation.      We
have a dual purpose goal, it starts with our decision to go all
organic, and our drive to help the poor. We want to make organic
successful, but
not lose our humanity
in the process. So we have made the decision to give 1/10 of our
flock to the poor every year. This means that we will give 1
lamb out of every 10 lambs to the poor. So the goal is to make
organic run on 90% of its total income. The remaining 10% goes
to charity.     Like
sheep we need the flock, we need to work as a community. The power of
our flock can change lives, it can give more to the community
in ways that one person possibly could.      We have
seen communities step forward and change lives for the better. That
is our goal, to change lives for the better. We desire to help,
and to help those that are in need. For every 10 lambs that
come to our Ranch, we set aside one for charity. This female
sheep is dedicated as breeding stock for the
local charity, instead of her offspring going
to market, they are given to those who are in need:
the disabled,
low income seniors,
single mothers, veterans,
and organizations that distribute food to the hungry.  This
is who
we are for and the
causes we are dedicated
to.      We
need to increase the operation that we already have. This means we
need to determine what it would take to be able to produce 10 lambs a
year for charity. 
     It worked out
that you can support 10 sheep on 1 acre of good pasture land. So we
decided to separate the fundraiser into 10 parts. In essence we have
10 goals.           1.
We needed to
determine the price per acre for land. After
doing a lot of research, we found
that it can be purchased for $5,000. (especially if we have cash to
offer.)
     2.
We had to determine what it would cost to purchase the sheep. Sheep
in our area are going for somewhere around $200-$300 a lamb. The
price can vary, based on the breed of sheep. We have chosen
a Suffolk breed, it is common in our area, and is
affordable, considering how much meat this particular breed
produces. If we put 10 sheep on an acre that means 1 lamb for
the poor and 9 for the Ranch, that would put us around $3000 per
acre.

     3.
Living costs etc... are going to be around $2000 per acre. If we buy
land, most
likely we will have to build the living quarters ourselves. This
cost will be low because Michael Mills will be doing all the labor.







     We
are a couple with 4 children, who are dedicated to their well being.
This makes our motivation to be all Organic even more important. This
adds accountability to our Ranch. 
We don't
use any chemical's even the most mild, as they could harm our
children's health. Both of our sons have developmental
disorders: the eldest of the boys (Joe) has Autistic Spectrum
Disorder and the second boy (Isaiah) has forms of Dyspraxia. Because
of their developmental delays, it is not wise to use even the mildest
chemical on our Ranch. This is one of the greatest reasons why we are
fully committed  to the organic, all natural movement, it is
because of our children, and
our commitment to those children that we can help.


     We
have bills to pay just like you, so we feel for the average consumer.
We have 4 children to supply for, 2 with developmental disorders, and
1 that was a 7 month old preemie.
They all have special requirements, and they are all very precious to
us. We can't stress this point enough, we are not a typical business
or
corporation,
but a business run by real people that really care. Visit: www.millsorganichills.com for more.


We have a set of gifts that we want to offer to you for donating to this cause. Take a look at the following:




This is the most important gift you can give. We see your support as one of the highest gifts available. So We Give You Our Thanks.
This is one of the joys of owning animals, you get to know them, and then based on what you know about them, you name them. We want to make this experience available to you today.

You will receive an actual rams horn that has been made into a musical horn. This kit will also include a DVD on how to blow the rams horn. It will be narrated by Michael Mills, (farm owner).This will give us the ability to give one lamb's worth of meat to a homeless shelter or to someone in need. We will take the lamb to the slaughter house, and have it prepared for the needy. We will then deliver it in your name.



This is one of the most powerful ways that you can give. If you donate $10,000 we will guarantee that a local charity has one lamb a year given to them for life. These are our passion gifts, one that has also driven us to do the same. We currently are setup to give 3 lambs a year to a local charity. Please, assist us in our efforts.
We think that food is the most precious of gifts, and organic is best. We strive to see a world not deprived of real food.GIVE TODAY!!",9.0,9,"1 Campaign

There are plenty of SD40-2s around; in fact, one recently became part of the collection in Pomona in place of the Big Boy locomotive that moved to Cheyenne, WY. Meanwhile, there is one locomotive worthy of your attention: a Burlington Northern F45 diesel locomotive, the second-to-last F45 ever built, and time is critical.</p><p>BN F45 #6644 was built in April, 1971. Ordered by Burlington Northern and delivered in its ""Cascade"" green paint scheme with white stripes, it was used primarily in freight service, but BN F45s have been known to pull Amtrak North Coast Hiawatha trains across Montana, Idaho and Washington. Montana Rail Link, a regional railroad, acquired this unit and renumbered it MRL 390 for use in freight service on their lines. MRL 390 made its last hurrah on a trip to Southern California in 2006, traversing Tehachapi Loop and the Columbia River Gorge.</p><p>There are three BN F45 locomotives remaining; two in Livingston, Montana, and one on the NYSW in New York. There are no known plans to preserve any of them, yet folks on rail forums have expressed interest that at least one should be saved.

In 2007 (the last year for which key data was available), <a href=""http://clatl.com/freshloaf/archives/2014/03/13/report-atlantas-underground-sex-trade-is-booming"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Atlanta's underground sex economy</a> netted $290 million from an <a href=""http://www.cbs46.com/story/24425994/human-trafficking-brutal-and-widespread-ingeorgia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">extensive network of prostitution</a>. Worldwide, the sex trade industry produces almost <a href=""http://www.change.org/petitions/stop-child-sex-trafficking"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">$10 billion annually</a>.</p>
<p>It's numbers like these that keep Hillary DeJarnett up at night. As co-founder and program director of Haven ATL, a nonprofit with a mission to end sex trafficking in metro Atlanta and beyond, DeJarnett and her team, including co-founder Sandra Pobjie-Pawar, work to help women go from victims of abuse to leaders in their communities.</p>
<p>""These girls are powerful,"" DeJarnett says. ""They're smart. They're intelligent. They just really need support and they need to be held accountable and have a place to grow, so that's what we try to do.""</p>
<p>The idea for Haven came to DeJarnett in 2011 while working on her master's thesis in nonprofit management at the University of Georgia. The assignment turned into a full-time job after DeJarnett presented the idea to Pobjie-Pawar. The pair officially established Haven ATL that summer as a program of the Salvation Army (DeJarnett's parents are Salvation Army officers).</p>
<p>Haven ATL assists women, girls, and transgendered individuals of all ages who have experienced exploitation. Local shelters, including Salvation Army's Red Shield Downtown, which has transgender dorms and houses same-sex families in need, among other things, refers victims of commercial sexual exploitation directly to Haven. While the shelters provide housing in the evening, Haven ATL works around the clock to get the women back on their feet with counseling, education, and job training.</p>
<p>Haven ATL currently operates out of the Salvation Army's 53,000-square-foot Ray and Joan Kroc Corps Community Center in the Pittsburgh neighborhood. Later this year, Haven ATL will move into its own drop-in center and offices. The donated house, also in Pittsburgh, will provide a more intimate setting where the 20 women involved in Haven ATL will be able to experience its services under one roof, including counseling and mentorship, job training, cooking classes, yoga, and voluntary Bible study, among other things. There's a community garden in the backyard, where the women have been working together, learning about farming, and developing a sense of pride in how their landscaping work is paying off.</p>
<p>""I think the house is truly going to be that haven for the women,"" DeJarnett says. ""That place that they can come and know that they are safe and know that they are loved.""</p>
<p>As part of <em>Creative Loafing</em>'s Do Good Campaign, a series of grassroots partnerships with local organizations, we're collaborating with Haven ATL to raise funds to renovate the new drop-in center and help landscape the yard and garden. Do Good partner the Home Depot Foundation will match the money raised with in-kind donations up to $2,500. All funds raised and matching donations from Home Depot Foundation will go directly to Haven ATL in support of the Pittsburgh drop-in center.</p>
<p>Haven's relationship to the Salvation Army initially raised concerns for us at <em>Creative Loafing</em> because of instances of the organization's reported discrimination toward the LGBT community. <em>Creative Loafing</em> is a strong supporter of gay rights and the fight for equal rights in which the LGBT community is engaged.</p>
<p>""I know that there have been issues in the past that have been brought up with the Salvation Army, but those were isolated instances and I can assure you that the Salvation Army does not discriminate in who we serve as reflected in our mission statement. Our shelter in Atlanta actually has specific services for Transgendered homeless individuals. Haven ATL has served LGBT individuals and we want to continue to champion serving individuals regardless of their background,"" DeJarnett said in an email earlier this spring. ""My hope was that this [Do Good] partnership would help bridge and repair the relationship between the LGBT community and the Salvation Army — it could open the door for reconciliation and positive change.""</p>
<p>Pam, a former madam who turned to the sex trade after her family was displaced by Hurricane Katrina, sought help at Haven after being arrested. Pam works with DeJarnett's team to reach out to individuals in the community who may be too afraid or ashamed to seek help. She's now one of the organization's community leaders and helps get women, girls, and transgendered individuals out of the industry rather than into it.</p>
<p>""I kept trying to do it by myself and I kept falling back into it,"" she says. ""If you're already thinking about changing, [Haven ATL is] the place to actually make it happen.""</p></div>","Atlanta ranks among the top 14 cities in the nation for commercial sexual exploitation of children.

<p></p><p>Early childhood brain development
takes place across a wide range of social, emotional and cognitive dimensions.
One key area of development occurs in terms of language and literacy. Language
and literacy encompasses a child’s ability to express their wants and needs,
understand a growing vocabulary, and establishes the foundation for developing
comfort with reading. Early reading practices can be established very early in
life. Early reading, in turn, gives a child a leg up on academic success.</p>
<p></p><p>Unfortunately, not all children have high quality early childhood literacy experiences. Researchers have found that while there are more than a dozen books per child in middle-income neighborhoods, in low-income neighborhoods the ratio is closer to one book for every three hundred children.Compounding these differences, low-income families engage in much less conversation and use smaller vocabularies when talking with their children. The result is that there are stark differences in the early exposure to reading of different groups of children. In low-income families, time as well as money are scarce, and books may be considered a costly luxury.</p><p>In turn, children from low-income families are further disadvantaged when it comes to early exposure to reading. This, in turn, creates massive reading readiness gaps between even the youngest children. By age three, children from wealthier families have typically heard 30 million more words than children from low-income families.When they reach school, children from low-income families have one-fourth the vocabulary of children from wealthier homes.By the time children from low-income families enter kindergarten, they are 12-14 months below national norms in language and pre-reading skills.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p></p><p><a href=""http://www.urbanchildinstitute.org/articles/research-to-policy/policy/poverty-can-jeopardize-the-development-of-literacy-and-early"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.urbanchildinstitute.org/articles/research-to-policy/policy/poverty-can-jeopardize-the-development-of-literacy-and-early"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Taken from Urban Child Institute</a></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1403844/files/20150421150053-Indiegogo2__2_.png?1429653653"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p><b>: a bar that specializes in serving high-quality beer and food.</b></p>
<p>It has been almost two years since we opened our doors to the 
wonderful people of Greer and your support has been overwhelming. Since 
day one, our goal has been to give locals a good place to get great 
beer. We take pride in the experience we build for our customers
 with our knowledgeable and helpful staff, fun and relaxing environment,
 and, of course, 60 rotating craft beers on tap.  
</p><p>Now we are asking for everyone to get involved in making The Southern Growl even better.. <i>I know, I know, you're wondering how that's even possible</i>.. 
</p><p>We are growing out of the small space we have right now, which you've
 probably noticed. We are now in the works of combining our current space with 
the vacancy next door. This will give us the opportunity to triple indoor seating, build a patio deck outside, provide more unique games, and, 
best of all, we are adding a<b> KITCHEN</b>! We are the beer experts as 
we always say, so we are bringing in local food expert and our good friend Joey McCarter to head up the 
food side of things. We're so glad to be working with Joey, especially because he has a knack for making great food that tastes best 
along side a great beer.
</p><p>The Southern Growl Gastropub will be a laid back casual place, just 
as it is now. The beer will be as good as always and the food will be the perfect
 compliment. Our concept was inspired by the food trucks that frequent 
craft beer hubs around the country. You will order your food at a window
 from a concise, rotating menu, representing many cultures and flavors. 
Ingredients will be local when possible, seasonal, and obviously 
delicious. Our hours will not change much at first; we will be open for 
dinner everyday and eventually we plan to be 
open early for <i><b>brunch on Saturday and Sunday!</b></i>
</p> <p> </p><h3>A little give.. and a little get..
</h3><p>We are working toward <b>$15,000</b> in contributions through Indiegogo in order to supplement our existing investments.  
</p><p>Funds raised will go to purchasing supplies for our kitchen.. things 
like an oven, a griddle, a stove, a hood, shelving, prep tables, pots, 
pans, knives and whatever other small stuff we can squeeze out of those dollars to make the most of your contributions.</p>
<p>We have so many great perks for you to choose when you offer up your support.. 
</p><p><b>Matt's </b>obvious favorite is the<b> Ultimate Tasting Experience</b>..<b>You get a 5 oz pour of each of the 60 beers on tap, all at once on the ultimate
 flight paddle! Bring as many friends as you want and we'll throw in 3 
appetizers, plus free soda all night for your DD.</b></p><b>
</b><p><b>Joey</b> is our awesome chef and, of course, his favorite perk is the <i><b>Meal to Remember</b></i>..
 for $150 you and a guest get to enjoy a five course beer pairing dinner. Come hungry, 
thirsty, and ready to indulge.
</p><p><b>Anna</b> suggests the <b><i>Cocktail Hour</i></b> perk.. You can 
bring a date ($50) or not ($30) to an exclusive party. We'll start off your beer tab with $15 a 
person and our chef will be making some killer hor d’oeuvres. 
</p><p><b>Jason</b> always says, ""A beer a day keeps the doctor away"", so the <b><i>Pint Night..Every Night </i></b>is
 simply perfect! This is our biggest perk with the biggest 
possibilities. It lasts you years and years, all the way to the end of 2020.. 
unless the world ends, then you better drink more sooner! Every pint, 
every time.. $1 off</p>
<p><b>Josh</b> wants you to <b><i>Sponsor a Stool</i></b>.. Your 
name will be permanently displayed on a stool that will 
probably be in the bar until the end of time. We can only fit so many 
stools, so get it while it lasts!</p>
<p><b>Andy</b> loves them all.. and if
 you're really excited, just buy one of each! When you help us out, you get a little 
something back in return! Every contribution helps us reach our goal. <br/></p><p>You will receive an emailed voucher for your purchase. If you need your items shipped to you, no problem.. just reply to that email and let us know the address (U.S. Only).<br/></p> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Help us to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign!

: a bar that specializes in serving high-quality beer and food.
It has been almost two years since we opened our doors to the 
wonderful people of Greer and your support has been overwhelming. Since 
day one, our goal has been to give locals a good place to get great 
beer. We take pride in the experience we build for our customers
 with our knowledgeable and helpful staff, fun and relaxing environment,
 and, of course, 60 rotating craft beers on tap.  
Now we are asking for everyone to get involved in making The Southern Growl even better.. I know, I know, you're wondering how that's even possible.. 
We are growing out of the small space we have right now, which you've
 probably noticed. We are now in the works of combining our current space with 
the vacancy next door. This will give us the opportunity to triple indoor seating, build a patio deck outside, provide more unique games, and, 
best of all, we are adding a KITCHEN! We are the beer experts as 
we always say, so we are bringing in local food expert and our good friend Joey McCarter to head up the 
food side of things. We're so glad to be working with Joey, especially because he has a knack for making great food that tastes best 
along side a great beer.
The Southern Growl Gastropub will be a laid back casual place, just 
as it is now. The beer will be as good as always and the food will be the perfect
 compliment. Our concept was inspired by the food trucks that frequent 
craft beer hubs around the country. You will order your food at a window
 from a concise, rotating menu, representing many cultures and flavors. 
Ingredients will be local when possible, seasonal, and obviously 
delicious. Our hours will not change much at first; we will be open for 
dinner everyday and eventually we plan to be 
open early for brunch on Saturday and Sunday!
  A little give.. and a little get..
We are working toward $15,000 in contributions through Indiegogo in order to supplement our existing investments.  
Funds raised will go to purchasing supplies for our kitchen.. things 
like an oven, a griddle, a stove, a hood, shelving, prep tables, pots, 
pans, knives and whatever other small stuff we can squeeze out of those dollars to make the most of your contributions.
We have so many great perks for you to choose when you offer up your support.. 
Matt's obvious favorite is the Ultimate Tasting Experience..You get a 5 oz pour of each of the 60 beers on tap, all at once on the ultimate
 flight paddle! Bring as many friends as you want and we'll throw in 3 
appetizers, plus free soda all night for your DD.
Joey is our awesome chef and, of course, his favorite perk is the Meal to Remember..
 for $150 you and a guest get to enjoy a five course beer pairing dinner. Come hungry, 
thirsty, and ready to indulge.
Anna suggests the Cocktail Hour perk.. You can 
bring a date ($50) or not ($30) to an exclusive party. We'll start off your beer tab with $15 a 
person and our chef will be making some killer hor d’oeuvres. 
Jason always says, ""A beer a day keeps the doctor away"", so the Pint Night..Every Night is
 simply perfect! This is our biggest perk with the biggest 
possibilities. It lasts you years and years, all the way to the end of 2020.. 
unless the world ends, then you better drink more sooner! Every pint, 
every time.. $1 off
Josh wants you to Sponsor a Stool.. Your 
name will be permanently displayed on a stool that will 
probably be in the bar until the end of time. We can only fit so many 
stools, so get it while it lasts!
Andy loves them all.. and if
 you're really excited, just buy one of each! When you help us out, you get a little 
something back in return! Every contribution helps us reach our goal. You will receive an emailed voucher for your purchase. If you need your items shipped to you, no problem.. just reply to that email and let us know the address (U.S. Only). Other Ways You Can Help
Help us to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign! 
Use the Indiegogo share tools, send emails, yell to your neighbors from 
your front porch.. it all helps! And as always, you can show your support by stopping in for a beer or two and inviting your friends!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h4><b>Engine</b></h4>
<h4>
<span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The engine we have chosen for this build is the Cummins 4BT. This is the 3.9L little brother of the famous 12v Cummins that is widely used and abused in the diesel community. Though it has two less cylinders, this engine can make serious power with small, inexpensive upgrades. With an upgraded fuel pump and bigger injectors, we can make substantially more power and roll some serious coal in the process. Changing the rev limiter will open up the power band and keep the car sideways. We will be attaching a ford t19 4 speed transmission to the coal roller. This transmission was chosen due to the availability of parts, its small size and weight. The transmission's gearing will work great with the ford 8.8 rear end equipped with a 410 final drive. This differential is popular among many Miata swaps because of its compatibility with the drive axles and its resilience under high torque. In order to fit this engine, <a href=""http://v8roadsters.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">V8roadsters.com</a> will be working with us to adapt their popular LS1 engine cradle for our application. We will also be ordering their ford 8.8 rear end conversion kit, as well as the frame bracing system.</span></span><i style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></i>

<br/>
</div><h4><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Weight </b></h4><div>As a lot of people have pointed out, this engine is heavy… very heavy, and we understand that it will take the 50/50 weight distribution the Miata is known for and throw it out the window.

</div></div>","What are we doing? 
We are building a diesel powered, Mazda Miata, drift car,  then drifting it, then raffling it off. All of the money raised from the sale, plus any money donated over the cost of the build will be given to a local highschool shop class to help inspire more auto enthusiasts like us!  The part that isn't plain, or simple, is that we will be building this monstrosity in a mere 48 hours or less. You may be asking yourself ""How is that even possible?"" Well, with a  little help from our friends. We have assembled a small team and will be locking ourselves in a shop for two straight days, only leaving to get supplies and pick up pizza. When the dust settles, we will have a beast of a tire slayer to take to events all over North America.  
 What do we need? 
The Money that you will be donating will not only get you cool stuff, it will also help with this crazy build. We are starting from scratch, we already have the car and the engine is on the way, we just need more go fast bits. The more money that we can raise, the crazier that this build will be. We have priced it out, and 10k will be enough to build the car and get you guys your cool stuff. 


Other Donations 
If you can't donate that's cool.... we are broke too... hence the reason for this page. We are looking for people to come out and help with the build as well! The more hands, the easier this will be and the greater the chance that we will get this done. If you work for a company that can help us source parts, food, supplies... beer, please let us know. Anything and everything is needed and appreciated. We want this car to be for everyone and for hundreds of people tell their friends that they helped build this Frankenstein's monster.The Build...
The Car
We have been graciously donated a 1990 Mazda Miata from Havelock Car and Truck repair. The car has some surface rust that needs to be taken care of, but the frame rails are solid and it is currently in running and driving condition. With some new body panels and some awesome graphics, this car will be ready for its new heart and soul.







Engine

The engine we have chosen for this build is the Cummins 4BT. This is the 3.9L little brother of the famous 12v Cummins that is widely used and abused in the diesel community. Though it has two less cylinders, this engine can make serious power with small, inexpensive upgrades. With an upgraded fuel pump and bigger injectors, we can make substantially more power and roll some serious coal in the process. Changing the rev limiter will open up the power band and keep the car sideways. We will be attaching a ford t19 4 speed transmission to the coal roller. This transmission was chosen due to the availability of parts, its small size and weight. The transmission's gearing will work great with the ford 8.8 rear end equipped with a 410 final drive. This differential is popular among many Miata swaps because of its compatibility with the drive axles and its resilience under high torque. In order to fit this engine, V8roadsters.com will be working with us to adapt their popular LS1 engine cradle for our application. We will also be ordering their ford 8.8 rear end conversion kit, as well as the frame bracing system.




Weight As a lot of people have pointed out, this engine is heavy… very heavy, and we understand that it will take the 50/50 weight distribution the Miata is known for and throw it out the window. Our plan to help reduce the weight offset is to run a trunk mounted rad system, as well as a fuel cell as far back as possible. We will also be mounting the engine as far back on the subframe as possible, to keep the nose off the ground. 
SuspensionWith the increased weight of the 4BT, the front suspension will have to handle the increased load. We have spoken with a few suspension companies that all agree a set of larger springs on adjustable coils will be needed to help support the weight. At this time we are still looking for the right company to help us with this custom piece

Combined, the three of us have noticed a significant need in the Wasatch Front to have a dedicated space where parkour practitioners can come to work out, learn, and train. With your help, we can build a 7,500-square-foot facility dedicated <em>specifically</em> to parkour and freerunning, where the passionate and the curious alike can come to learn and grow.</p>

<div align=""justify"" style=""text-align: justify;"">We have three founding members at Kinetic Parkour: Richard Coleman, Marisha Parker, and Jason Cox. Each has their own reasons for wanting to see Kinetic open its doors.</div>
<div align=""justify"" style=""text-align: justify;""> </div>
<div align=""justify"" style=""text-align: justify;"">Richard Coleman has been involved in parkour for many years. He had been using it to gain entrance to abandoned buildings long before he knew it was a formal discipline. He credits the video game ""Splinter Cell"" for sparking his interest in parkour, beginning in high school and continuing throughout his college years (he would have gotten his Bachelor's degree in Parkour instead of Psychology if they would have offered it).</div>
<div align=""justify"" style=""text-align: justify;""> </div>
<div align=""justify"" style=""text-align: justify;"">Three years ago, Richard became aware of parkour training sessions taking place in and around Salt Lake City, and it was then that the idea of a local parkour gym struck him. Fast forward to the present day, and Richard has all but given up training for the time being, preferring instead to focus on finally getting a Salt Lake City gym up and running so others can learn. Richard is the Executive Director of Kinetic Parkour, and will be handing the operations of the gym after we open (simply put, he'll be there from open to close to make sure everything runs smoothly)!</div>
<div align=""justify"" style=""text-align: justify;""> </div>
<div align=""justify"" style=""text-align: justify;"">Marisha Parker graduated from Utah State University with her Bachelor's degree in Biology, and is currently employed in a microbiology laboratory. She hopes to one day work with wildlife for her career, but for now, she wants to help Kinetic get going because she would like a place to train in parkour. She started drawing when she was 12 years old and has never stopped, though she credits getting her first digital art tablet with really cementing her drive to create. Marisha is the Chief Graphic Designer of Kinetic Parkour, and has been responsible for our awesome graphics thus far!</div>
<div align=""justify"" style=""text-align: justify;""> </div>
<div align=""justify"" style=""text-align: justify;"">Jason Cox has recently rediscovered his love for photography. He has been involved in some form of art or another since he was in junior high school, but he discovered several years ago that his favorite canvas was that of a photo. His favorite thing to photograph? People doing what they love. As soon as we heard that, we knew he was going to fit in at Kinetic just fine. Jason is our Chief Photographer, and has taken all the photos and videos so far for Kinetic Parkour. You'll see him around the gym once in a while, snapping pictures of people for gym promotions, but he's also offered to have a ""free day"" once in a while where he'll take a picture of you practicing parkour and email it to you so you can post it wherever you like!</div>

<p>Our goal is set at $8,000. After Indiegogo's fees and PayPal/credit card fees, we'll have roughly $7,000 left over for the gym. We will then quite literally take that money to the bank, prove to them how many people actually want this business started by showing off how many memberships we've sold <em>before we even open</em>, and within a few weeks we should have the money we need to get going on the gym. We should have a location selected and ready to lease by early May, have our building permit and business license in hand by late May, and be open for business in June!</p>
<p>If we do not reach our full campaign goal, don't worry; the gym will still open and you'll still get your perks! However, depending on how much money we still need, the gym will have to open later than June. <strong>If, for some unforeseen reason, the gym is unable to open by December 31, everyone who donated money will be refunded.</strong></p>

After all, that's why we're here; we want a parkour gym open so people like <em>you</em> will have a safe, legal space to train that's sheltered from the elements and has an emergency system in place in case something goes wrong. So, in exchange for supporting us while we get started up, we have a dozen perks that you can choose from! They're listed in greater detail on the right side of the screen, but the basic idea is that you can get awesome Kinetic merchandise like t-shirts and tank tops, HUGE discounts on memberships that we will <em>never be able to offer again</em>, and even some cool stuff like locker rentals and your name as a sponsor on our equipment.

<h2><img alt=""The Impact"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kineticparkour.com/images/impact.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;""/></h2>
<p>Kinetic Parkour was started with one goal in mind: To provide a safe, fun, affordable environment where anyone with a desire to learn can come train in parkour or freerunning.  Your donation will help make that a reality!</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, six months out of the year, Utah is not a safe place to learn parkour. There's ice and snow everywhere, and winter injury rates are very high. Gymnastic gyms offer token parkour and freerunning classes, but only on specific nights, and only for an hour or two at a time. In addition, there are virtually no places outdoors that allow practitioners to train on their property, as liability concerns and lawsuits have made property owners wary of anyone using their land in a way it was not intended for.</p>
<p>So here are the three current options for parkour enthusiasts (traceurs):</p>
<p>1) <strong>Train outside</strong>. This is not always safe and can open traceurs up to run-ins with law enforcement, even on public property such as parks.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Train in a gymnastic gym</strong>. This can get costly, and gymnastic gyms can have strict age restrictions prohibiting some people from using their equipment at all. Most gymnastic gyms simply are not equipped for parkour training.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Train indoors</strong>. There are few places with enough space to train in parkour, and fewer still who are actually <em>okay</em> with their property being used in this manner.</p>
<p>We want to add a fourth option: <strong>Train at Kinetic Parkour</strong>. Built by traceurs, <em>for</em> traceurs, with all liability concerns and safety hazards already accounted for. No need to worry about snow and ice, no strange age restrictions, and definitely no police coming around every thirty minutes to tell you to get down off of things. Sounds like heaven, right?</p>
<p>We think so, too.</p>
<p>If we hit our campaign goal of $8,000, we will be able to build a training facility with the following amenities:</p>
<ul>
<li>7,500 square feet of pure parkour joy. A 20-25 foot ceiling height will add a third dimension to your training.</li>
<li>A location accessible to the general public, within five miles of Downtown Salt Lake City.</li>
<li>A snack bar selling electrolyte drinks, energy bars, and protein shakes.</li>
<li>A work-out area with free weights, a treadmill, an elliptical, and an all-in-one exercise machine.</li>
<li>A mezzanine area with a couch so you can sit back and relax once in a while.</li>
<li>Electronic Admission System: Scan your Kinetic keychain barcode and you're in; no waiting-in-line-for-admission hassles.</li>
<li>Daily and Monthly Passes, so you can come in once a month or every single day, depending on your budget, and stay as long as you like.</li>
<li>A bars and pipes course for practicing rail skills.</li>
<li>Over a dozen plywood obstacles stretching as tall as 15 feet.</li>
<li>Precision jump training bars.</li>
<li>Balance training bars.</li>
<li>Several heights of vault boxes.</li>
<li>A modular fence system where you can physically remove the fence from the ground and replace it with another one. This gives you the ability to practice on different types of fences without having to leave the gym.</li>
<li>Movable gymnastic mats so you can place one under you to catch your fall if you're not sure you can make a certain jump.</li>
<li>Open gym <em>at all times</em>. Unlike other gyms that only offer a maximum two hours of open gym per day, we'll be open six to eight hours a day and will allow open gym for the whole duration.</li>
<li>Classes taught by local traceurs and freerunners, many of whom have trained with the founders of parkour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not bad for a measly $8,000! If we <em>surpass</em> our campaign goal, we will be able to purchase additional amenities to make your stay at Kinetic that much better.</p>
<h3><em><strong>If we reach:</strong></em></h3>
<p><strong> $10,000</strong></p>
<p>This will be enough to purchase everything listed above, and add a 1000 square foot area of spring gymnastic floor, so you can practice those tricky moves without fear of hitting something hard on your way down.</p>
<p><strong>$13,000</strong></p>
<p>We will be able to add on to the gymnastic floor by adding a 200 square foot area for a foam pit, to make learning techniques that much easier.</p>
<p><strong>$15,000</strong></p>
<p>Kinetic Parkour will be able to hire additional employees to make sure the gym is open seven days per week.</p>
<p><strong>$16,000</strong></p>
<p>A hardwood floor with plenty of mirrors for those of you into break-dancing or martial arts. With this addition, we will also be able to start holding more diverse classes.</p>
<p><strong>$18,000</strong></p>
<p>A Kinetic Parkour truck so that we can pack up our movable obstacles and do promotions for Team Kinetic on the road, allowing us to pick up sponsorships and advertising opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>$19,000</strong></p>
<p>We will be able to add a video editing station for Kinetic Parkour members to use, and Go-Pro camera and helmetcam rentals so you can film your runs in first and third person.</p>
<p><strong>$20,000</strong></p>
<p>We will be able to add on to our plywood and cement obstacles, making them bigger and taller to match your progression in the art of parkour.</p>
<p>...You get the idea! The point is, the more money we raise now, the more capital we have to put into making Kinetic Parkour not only Utah's parkour hotspot, but the world's coolest parkour and freerunning training facility.</p>

</div></div>","Kinetic Parkour will be a brand new parkour and freerunning training facility located in Salt Lake City, Utah. We are running this campaign to raise funds for a cash injection on a small business loan, which will then be used to purchase space, equipment, and obstacles.

Kinetic Parkour is a team of three people: Richard Coleman (Director), Marisha Parker (Graphic Designer), and Jason Cox (Photographer). Combined, the three of us have noticed a significant need in the Wasatch Front to have a dedicated space where parkour practitioners can come to work out, learn, and train. With your help, we can build a 7,500-square-foot facility dedicated specifically to parkour and freerunning, where the passionate and the curious alike can come to learn and grow.

We have three founding members at Kinetic Parkour: Richard Coleman, Marisha Parker, and Jason Cox. Each has their own reasons for wanting to see Kinetic open its doors.
 
Richard Coleman has been involved in parkour for many years. He had been using it to gain entrance to abandoned buildings long before he knew it was a formal discipline. He credits the video game ""Splinter Cell"" for sparking his interest in parkour, beginning in high school and continuing throughout his college years (he would have gotten his Bachelor's degree in Parkour instead of Psychology if they would have offered it).
 
Three years ago, Richard became aware of parkour training sessions taking place in and around Salt Lake City, and it was then that the idea of a local parkour gym struck him. Fast forward to the present day, and Richard has all but given up training for the time being, preferring instead to focus on finally getting a Salt Lake City gym up and running so others can learn.

<p>Economic security gives people the power to choose their path in life. It also gives people a voice and the ability to create their own change. The problem is…sustainable and dignified employment can be elusive.<br/><br/>In fact, in our global population of 7 billion, there are 300 million young people aged 15-24 living on less than $2 per day in this world. Youth unemployment rates are 6 times that of adults and when youth <em>can </em>find employment it is often informal, insecure, and low-wage. This type of ad-hoc work environment feeds long-term instability and limits economic participation. In the US, unemployment rates among high school graduates aged 17-20 hover around 30%, and underemployment is almost 55%. Including these youth in the workforce changes the trajectory of their lives, improves local economies, and increases the nation’s competitiveness.<br/><br/>Many of these youth have high school diplomas and want to find meaningful work to support themselves and their families or continue their education. While college is definitely the answer for some, many are limited by family responsibilities and struggle to justify the cost and time commitment additional schooling requires. So what can be done?<br/><br/>We need to create an opportunity for achievable, sustainable employment – that is where koapii comes in!<br/><br/>Need more convincing? Check out this recent article in The Economist, “Generation Jobless”: <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/international/21576657-around-world-almost-300m-15-24-year-olds-are-not-working-what-has-caused%20%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.economist.com/news/international/21576657-around-world-almost-300m-15-24-year-olds-are-not-working-what-has-caused</a></p>

<p><strong>The Idea</strong></p>
<p>The idea behind <strong>koapii</strong> is simple: train marginalized young adults to use existing digital marketing technologies to market local small and medium businesses. This will give the youth access to gainful and meaningful employment and will strengthen local economies by drawing more traffic to local small businesses.<br/><br/>Businesses all around the US are using online marketing tools to great effect. Even so, about half of the 27.5 million small businesses don’t even have websites. Many of these businesses just don’t know where to start and feel overwhelmed by managing a digital presence on top of running a business. McKinsey has found that small businesses engaged in Internet marketing grow twice as fast as those who have no online presence – quite a compelling figure! So why not train and employ young adults to digitally market local small businesses. A local connection is maintained and both the youth and small businesses gain from increased exposure and opportunity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Deets</strong></p>
<p>koapii is a hybrid social enterprise. We are in the process of registering the educational/training piece as a tax-deductible 501(C)(3) not-for-profit organization and the digital marketing piece as a Benefit Corporation (for more info on B Corps see: <a href=""http://benefitcorp.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://benefitcorp.net</a>). The long term goal is to fund koapii via fees paid by small businesses for digital marketing services. Although the organization will eventually be self-sustainable, outside funds are needed for start-up costs and expansion phases. This first round of crowd funding is being used to raise funds for the pilot project. koapii wants to use the pilot to create a solid program and work out some of the kinks associated with new ventures, before rolling out to the rest of the US and world.<br/><br/>koapii will teach qualified students how to digitally market small businesses for local (and later national/international) success. It will be a mobile, scalable learning suite with classroom curriculum, interactive online forums, and a knowledge library complete with online videos, interactive exercises, and the like. koapii will charge students a nominal fee to increase sense of ownership in the program. Learning topics will include: basic web creation, pay per click programs, social media campaigns, local search tactics, search engine optimization, basic shopping cart set-up, and more.<br/><br/>After participants pass through the learning modules, they are eligible to work with koapii to digitally market local small businesses. The youth will be paired with mentors until they are able to service clients alone. Local business clients will pay koapii for digital marketing services based on monthly fees for core packages and maintenance work. It will be koapii’s job to on-board small business clients so that the graduates can concentrate on doing what they now do best – marketing those businesses online!</p>
<p><em>But will these high school graduates from marginalized areas have what it takes to successfully market small businesses?</em></p>
<p>YES!  Everyone has the potential to learn – especially youth with minds ripe for engaging in the creative process and harnessing new technologies. In fact, we want to capitalize on the different experiences of these youth to formulate creative online marketing campaigns. That being said, we will have admission requirements and will measure each participant’s cognitive potential to succeed in the program. <br/><br/>So in the end, small businesses will grow and after two years youth participants will garner salaries an estimated 23% higher than current income levels in marginalized areas. The idea is to start small with a pilot in the Bronx and then expand nationally and globally, starting in Latin America. We’ve chosen to expand first in Latin America because 99% of all businesses are small and medium enterprises; most of these enterprises do not have an online presence; in 2012 smart phone sales hit 145 million; and unattached youth rates – those who neither work nor attend school – range from 45-78%. The market in Latin America is largely untapped so koapii’s impact could be tremendous!</p>

<p> </p></div>","The Issue
Economic security gives people the power to choose their path in life. It also gives people a voice and the ability to create their own change. The problem is…sustainable and dignified employment can be elusive.In fact, in our global population of 7 billion, there are 300 million young people aged 15-24 living on less than $2 per day in this world. Youth unemployment rates are 6 times that of adults and when youth can find employment it is often informal, insecure, and low-wage. This type of ad-hoc work environment feeds long-term instability and limits economic participation. In the US, unemployment rates among high school graduates aged 17-20 hover around 30%, and underemployment is almost 55%. Including these youth in the workforce changes the trajectory of their lives, improves local economies, and increases the nation’s competitiveness.Many of these youth have high school diplomas and want to find meaningful work to support themselves and their families or continue their education. While college is definitely the answer for some, many are limited by family responsibilities and struggle to justify the cost and time commitment additional schooling requires. So what can be done?We need to create an opportunity for achievable, sustainable employment – that is where koapii comes in!Need more convincing? Check out this recent article in The Economist, “Generation Jobless”: http://www.economist.com/news/international/21576657-around-world-almost-300m-15-24-year-olds-are-not-working-what-has-caused

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Shop with a Mustang is a program put together by Kennesaw Mountain High School. The school has provided this program for years. Its purpose is to provide for under privileged children and families in the Kennesaw area with food and clothing. This program is centered around Christmas time with the idea that no child should be denied having a good Christmas. It provides both food and warm clothing for its participants when they need it the most. Each previous year that the program was in effect, we were able to provide for every family that needed this service, but this year the program has a deficit. Last year our school gave so much to the community with this program and helped pay for the treatment of a very sick Mustang student. Please donate so that this year's program will be a success and no child will have to go without some of the things we take for granted.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All of the money that is amassed will go directly to Kennesaw Mountain's Shop with a Mustang program. It will then go directly into use for the families in the program that need it. Our goal is to raise about 500-1000 dollars but, honestly, any amount would be a blessing to receive. When I heard about what the program needed I had to act because I couldn't imagine having to go through Christmas with little food and no gifts. I realize each day these are some of the things many of us take for granted but they aren't promised. I hope that you, my hopeful donator, can have empathy for these families in need. Remember that we are all people and that our compassion is the definition of our humanity.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation will provide a family with a turkey and other items for a proper meal. Many of the families will rely on this meal to get their children through the winter break. Your money will also provide clothing to keep the families warm through the cold month of December. I promise, through previous experience with the program, that each family that receives your help will be very grateful. Afterwards, if possible, I plan to make a video with some of the families that received help to show how grateful they are.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Any amount helps but if a donation isn't possible you can always help spread the word of my cause. You can e-mail me at <a href=""mailto:jacobyship@yahoo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jacobyship@yahoo.com</a> and I will be happy to send you information, flyers, or anything else you may need to help make a contribution.

<b>HUB Oaxaca is a
collaborative space for emerging social entrepreneurs in Southern México hoping
to transform their region by doing the work they love.</b><p></p>
<p><i>1 part collaborative working space</i></p>
<p><i>1 part learning centre</i></p>
<p><i>1 part support network</i></p>
<p>HUB Oaxaca brings talented and tenacious social innovators in the region
together, to collaborate, increase their impact and to grow. </p>
<p>We are a locally-run association, with a diverse and dynamic team from
inside and outside Oaxaca. Linked to over 40 other HUBs around the globe (<a href=""http://www.impacthub.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.impacthub.net/</a>), we
support local non-profits and emerging social entrepreneurs through a diverse
array of spaces, services and classes. Come join us in building a stronger
community that's working to change our world!</p>
<p><b>We are looking
to sponsor our learning programs for 2014 to offer scholarships
to the incredible social innovators in Oaxaca who are addressing poverty,
hunger, violence and environmental degradation with immense dedication and the
reality of <i>very</i> limited resources. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What we do.</b></p>
<p>HUB Oaxaca provides a collective office, meeting rooms and event spaces,
capacity-building classes, as well as project development services to our
community to build stronger projects and a connected community.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/0p3BSzolpU4?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>In our Learning Space, we give local entrepreneurs access
to incredible experts. We build classes with practical content and with the space and
support necessary to <i>put into practice</i> the tools they
are learning. Topics range from: finding the right investor, strategic marketing, facilitation,
impact measurement, operation &amp; administration, business model development,
among others.  Since 2011 we have trained
over 230 social entrepreneurs, offering scholarships to almost half, thanks to
past sponsors. Help us continue to grow this essential local learning space for
our region.</p>
<p><b>Meet the faces
that, with access to the HUB's services, are transforming Oaxaca...</b></p>
<p>Over the last three years the HUB has supported more than 200
entrepreneurs from distinct fields: reforestation, eco-architecture, health, human
rights, food security, learning design, urban transit and <b>we continue integrating more each year.</b></p>
<p>Meet Vicente Cruz, who works alongside Oaxacan communities encouraging the use of native corn varieties with his innovative commercialisation
model that employs indigenous women by setting up tortilla stores. Vicente took our 100-day incubator workshop to build out his
business concept, and will prototype his project in the HUB's facilities.
Access to our space, forums to pitch his idea and incredible mentors has given
his initiative the launching pad to strengthen his idea and grow. </p>
<p>Meet Mundo Ceiba in their office at the HUB, where young entrepreneur Rubén García helms an initiative that convenes hundreds of young volunteers to
promote alternative urban mobility and ecological sustainability through
critical mass bike rides and reforestation campaigns. The HUB affords Mundo
Ceiba a collective and central space and interconnected network, to engage his
young volunteers and launch his weekly rides. </p>
<p>Meet Lupe Chavez from AgroSanO, an electrical engineer turned organic
farmer whose project trains local producers on organic cultivation techniques
to promote and build out the sustainable food systems in Oaxaca. She took our
Fundraising and Donor Relations workshop last year, and through collaboration
with a fellow workshop participant, applied for, and achieved a large collective
grant that funded the training they will carry out throughout the year. </p>
<p><b>What your
donation does...</b></p>
<p>We need to keep these services accessible and available to local
entrepreneurs. The small fees we charge
for space and classes only covers 20% of
operating costs. To keep offering entrepreneurs like Vicente, Rubén and Lupe
access to top notch learning opportunities, excellent teachers and mentors, as
well as the facilities to incubate their ideas, we need your help. Our $20,000
goal will cover operational costs for the Learning Center--space, teacher
salaries, materials, equipment. A generous contribution from sponsor Halloran
Philanthropies has covered the additional cost for us to manage and
administrate the Learning Space. Now help us bridge the remaining gap to make
the Learning Space for the remainder of 2013/2014 a reality. <b>#everybitcounts.</b></p>
<p><b>Funding with
purpose...  </b></p>
<p>Be a part of our amazing community of change makers.  Join us in transforming our world for the
better. A small contribution can go a long way. We
invite you to renew your commitment to help us strengthen our community. <b>Your
donation is the difference.</b></p>
<p><b>Other ways you
can help...</b></p>
<p>A financial donation isn't the only way to contribute. Share this
information via Facebook, Twitter or email with your network. Let your friends
and relatives know about HUB Oaxaca. <b>Spread

social actors?  Get in touch so we can

collaborative space for emerging social entrepreneurs in Southern México hoping
to transform their region by doing the work they love.
1 part collaborative working space
1 part learning centre
1 part support network
HUB Oaxaca brings talented and tenacious social innovators in the region
together, to collaborate, increase their impact and to grow. 
We are a locally-run association, with a diverse and dynamic team from
inside and outside Oaxaca. Linked to over 40 other HUBs around the globe (http://www.impacthub.net/), we
support local non-profits and emerging social entrepreneurs through a diverse
array of spaces, services and classes. Come join us in building a stronger
community that's working to change our world!
We are looking
to sponsor our learning programs for 2014 to offer scholarships
to the incredible social innovators in Oaxaca who are addressing poverty,
hunger, violence and environmental degradation with immense dedication and the
reality of very limited resources. 

What we do.
HUB Oaxaca provides a collective office, meeting rooms and event spaces,
capacity-building classes, as well as project development services to our
community to build stronger projects and a connected community.

In our Learning Space, we give local entrepreneurs access
to incredible experts. We build classes with practical content and with the space and
support necessary to put into practice the tools they
are learning. Topics range from: finding the right investor, strategic marketing, facilitation,
impact measurement, operation & administration, business model development,
among others.  Since 2011 we have trained
over 230 social entrepreneurs, offering scholarships to almost half, thanks to
past sponsors. Help us continue to grow this essential local learning space for
our region.
Meet the faces
that, with access to the HUB's services, are transforming Oaxaca...
Over the last three years the HUB has supported more than 200
entrepreneurs from distinct fields: reforestation, eco-architecture, health, human
rights, food security, learning design, urban transit and we continue integrating more each year.
Meet Vicente Cruz, who works alongside Oaxacan communities encouraging the use of native corn varieties with his innovative commercialisation
model that employs indigenous women by setting up tortilla stores. Vicente took our 100-day incubator workshop to build out his
business concept, and will prototype his project in the HUB's facilities.
Access to our space, forums to pitch his idea and incredible mentors has given
his initiative the launching pad to strengthen his idea and grow. 
Meet Mundo Ceiba in their office at the HUB, where young entrepreneur Rubén García helms an initiative that convenes hundreds of young volunteers to
promote alternative urban mobility and ecological sustainability through
critical mass bike rides and reforestation campaigns. The HUB affords Mundo
Ceiba a collective and central space and interconnected network, to engage his
young volunteers and launch his weekly rides. 
Meet Lupe Chavez from AgroSanO, an electrical engineer turned organic
farmer whose project trains local producers on organic cultivation techniques
to promote and build out the sustainable food systems in Oaxaca. She took our
Fundraising and Donor Relations workshop last year, and through collaboration
with a fellow workshop participant, applied for, and achieved a large collective
grant that funded the training they will carry out throughout the year. 
What your
donation does...
We need to keep these services accessible and available to local
entrepreneurs. The small fees we charge
for space and classes only covers 20% of
operating costs. To keep offering entrepreneurs like Vicente, Rubén and Lupe
access to top notch learning opportunities, excellent teachers and mentors, as
well as the facilities to incubate their ideas, we need your help. Our $20,000
goal will cover operational costs for the Learning Center--space, teacher
salaries, materials, equipment. A generous contribution from sponsor Halloran
Philanthropies has covered the additional cost for us to manage and
administrate the Learning Space. Now help us bridge the remaining gap to make
the Learning Space for the remainder of 2013/2014 a reality. #everybitcounts.
Funding with
purpose...  
Be a part of our amazing community of change makers.  Join us in transforming our world for the
better. A small contribution can go a long way. We
invite you to renew your commitment to help us strengthen our community. Your
donation is the difference.
Other ways you
can help...
A financial donation isn't the only way to contribute. Share this
information via Facebook, Twitter or email with your network. Let your friends
and relatives know about HUB Oaxaca. Spread
the word. Or offer your talents and expertise to our network! Do you have a
field of knowledge or contact that might be helpful to our family of emerging
social actors?  Get in touch so we can
get you connected! 
Rewards!
We have amazing rewards for our collaborators; check it out at the
right! As a thank you for your donation you can receive beautiful products
created by our members, like a fantastic pitcher from our member project Colectivo
1050° (normally sold at MoMa Design Store). Our best reward will be our sincere
thanks.

<h3>Seaweed Education: The Big Challenge</h3>
<p>When we demo our wild-harvested, single-ingredient seaweeds, we constantly find ourselves going back to basics. ""Seaweed"" is not a single thing, but really hundreds of different kinds of sea vegetables.  Sea vegetables are as plentiful and diverse as the leafy greens and flowers of any land garden, each with its own flavor profile and texture.</p>

</div></div>","Help us continue to grow this campaign! We reached our first financial goal with just 100 fabulous backers... WOW! 
Spread the word. Sea vegetables are good... and good for you! This message can get to soooooo many more people. You can show the world you agree by joining.


We hit our base goal of $14,000 in five days. (WOW!). We think the buzz around sea vegetables can only GROW with YOUR SUPPORT. In exchange, we are offering super-fun perks: first-release chocolate bars; seaweed harvesting classes on the Sonoma Coast; the chance to become a Mermaid for a day; or, to have the Mermaid Princess come to your next event! 
Your contribution will help us launch the Seaweed Chocolate Bar. And, even more, this project will connect natural foods consumers more deeply to the ocean and its great bounty.
Check out the sidebar to contribute and read on for more about THE Seaweed Chocolate Bar!   


We are the Sea of Change Trading Company. We harvest wild sea vegetables in Northern California and create new and exciting vegan snack foods with these incredible edible gifts of the Ocean. 
We already make Sea Bakin' -- a tasty treat that combines tender nori with organic coconut oil and maple syrup.  Now it's time to unite Land and Sea in a new way: Seaweed Chocolate.

Why Seaweed Chocolate?Why not? Cole was playing around one day with nori and some extra chocolate he had on hand before a community dinner. He combined these two ingredients, let it firm up into squares and took the treat to his landmates. They were AMAZED. ""Oh my!"" was heard around the room. Everyone loved the subtle, salty flavor and the crazy crunch. And thus the very early prototype of seaweed chocolate was born. Our snacks like to play where land and sea unite. We've already made Sea Bakin' from the nori sea vegetable, mixed it with organic coconut oil and maple syrup, and brought it into natural foods stores. It has a cult following and we are working on expanding distribution throughout California! Now we want to bring the cacao bean, one of land's most celebrated fruits and, quite literally, gift of the gods (Theobroma cacao) together with Mother Ocean's treasured vegetables.
We've worked for several months to find just the right sea vegetables and just the right cacao for this project. We began collaboration with a long-time chocolatier, fine-tuned our recipes and took the prototypes out to farmers' markets for taste testing. This process has let us get direct feedback from potential customers and it has put seaweed into the local conversation in a way it wasn't before. Suddenly, folks know the difference between nori, wakame and dulse. They understand the diversity of edible plant life in the ocean. And they've become more willing to try sea vegetables in more ways.Are you a chocolate lover? Are you a seaweed fanatic? Either way, this is for you!Dark chocolate lovers will swoon over this heirloom, unroasted cacao. You'll find your energy sustained, not spiked, by the medicinal effect of cacao, the low-glycemic nature of coconut sugar, and the mineral-rich crunch of seaweed.Sea vegetables add that salty goodness so many of us love in our chocolate, with an extra depth of flavor. Each of our three Seaweed Chocolate Bars carries its own subtle flavor profile, depending on the seaweed. 
Deep Dark Dulse puts the ocean flavors at the front, with soft anise end notes and a subtle crunch. This one is for true seaweed lovers!
Wild Nori Crunch brings a softer flavor (like putting Sea Bakin' in chocolate!) and adds a hearty crunch. Reminiscent of a crunch bar, but soooo much better for you.
Velvety Wakame gives you a smooth, nutty sensation. This one is for seaweed newbies who like a little salt on their dark chocolate!ABOVE: CALIFORNIA NORI IN MID-JUNEYou can help change the way we relate to the oceanRight now, few people view the ocean as a viable or sustainable food source and, yet, sea vegetables abound! Sea vegetables are highly nutritious, quickly regenerating vegetables from the ocean. They require no added water! Some grow up to three feet a day. And sea vegetables contain good stuff: iodine, B vitamins, all the trace minerals your body needs. You might not know this, but there are hundreds of edible sea vegetables growing out there. By experimenting over the last three years, we've found new ways to incorporate sea vegetables into our diet. As we've learned to eat from the ocean, we've learned to care more and more deeply for it. 
We want our food systems to be regenerative at their core. We want to integrate these amazing ocean plants into the way we eat, gathering and letting them regrow each year.

<p>The 52nd Street Market, LLC will serve as a one stop shop for grocery staples, fresh produce and prepared foods. Brewed coffee, limited seating and  free wi-fi for customers will also be be available. We hope our market will provide a much needed venue to get to know your neighbors. Because we wholeheartedly believe in contributing to the health of the community, we will not sell tobacco products or lottery.</p>
<p>The market is located on the corner of  52nd and Holmes Streets in Upper Lawrenceville, easily accessible from Butler Street and Stanton Avenue. We look forward to serving individuals who live and work in the Lawrenceville, Stanton Heights and Morningside neighborhoods! Once successful, we hope to make our model available to other neighborhoods interested in establishing a fresh retail community corner store.</p>
<h3>Who We Are.</h3>
<p>Opening The 52nd Street Market has been the work of Deirdre Kane and Dora Walmsley, we’re two residents of Upper Lawrenceville who want to ensure this rapidly revitalizing neighborhood maintains its local charm. We hope to accomplish this by providing opportunities for residents through employment, education and good, healthy food.</p>
<h3>In Our Words.</h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Deirdre, a Lawrenceville native.  I  began to more fully invest in the community by participating in Lawrenceville United’s monthly clean ups.  My volunteering expanded into joining committees to get more directly involved in the transformation of the neighborhood.  In 2009, I was  voted onto the Board of Lawrenceville United and remain an active Board Member today. It was my involvement in the community which lead directly to the creation of The 52nd Street Market. I decided Lawrenceville was not only going to be my home, but my future. I really want to be a part of the neighborhood fabric!</p>
<p>Hiya, I’m Dora, a transplant who grew up north of Pittsburgh. I’ve lived in Lawrenceville since 2008 and, most recently, purchased my first home just a few blocks from what soon will be The 52nd Street Market. While moving into the neighborhood I recall a roofer, working nearby, calling down and welcoming me to the neighborhood. This sense of community and willingness to know your neighbors is what drew me in and left me wanting to do more. Since then, I’ve volunteered with numerous community groups and was recently elected onto the Board of Directors for Lawrenceville United.</p>
<p>Together, we have 25 years of restaurant industry and food service experience. Our experience and knowledge will inform food preparation, inventory management and stellar customer service. We also know nothing is created in a vacuum and have derived much of our business plan from community meetings, surveys and many professional mentors who have graced us with their time and expertise. As an employee at Greater Pittsburgh Food Bank, Dora works directly with food insecurity and equitable access to food. In addition to providing a convenient location for neighbors to get their grocery basics, The 52nd Street Market hopes to also make healthy food accessible, affordable and inclusive. Deirdre, has worked at Highmark for the past 15 years and is working to connect community health to community assets. We believe that a neighborhood can provide all the resources and support needed to make families and individuals successful. The 52nd Street Market will serve its part by providing healthy food options and a platform to get to know your neighbors.</p>
<h3>Why Do This.</h3>
<p>As ‘accidental entrepreneurs’ neither one of us had envisioned running a community corner store as part of our future. When the opportunity presented itself however, the momentum, passion, and commitment was there and it just felt right. We feel we have the skill sets and ability to make The 52nd Street Market a viable business.  However, starting a business requires a significant amount of capital and your contributions will provide critical start-up funds. We have invested a substantial amount of time and personal money, and now are asking for your support. We hope, by doing so, you’ll feel personally invested in our success and the success of the neighborhood.</p>
<h3>What We’re Asking For.</h3>
<p>We’re bargain hunters by nature and have worked tirelessly to keep costs and our environmental impact low. The building owner has also worked with us to build out the space, provide the use of existing coolers and has agreed to a graduated lease - all at no additional cost to us. We’re still in need of substantial start-up funds and look to raise $50,000 which will be used to purchase start-up inventory, equipment and an additional cooler to store deli meats (A must have as expressed by over 100 residents!). To also help keep initial costs low, we are keeping our full-time jobs and will employ a full and part time local residents to run The Market during daylight hours. These funds will guarantee those salaries.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Funds will go towards purchasing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Initial inventory and inventory purchase reserve</p></li>
<li><p>Equipment including point of sales system, refurbished refrigeration units, coffee brewing system and coffee grinder, scales, meat slicer .</p></li>
<li><p>Furniture including seating, shelving storage, counter tops and food prep space.</p></li>
<li><p>6 Month salary reserve for employees</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>In Addition to Our Deepest Thanks...</h3>
<p>We think we’ve put together some pretty awesome incentives in exchange for your contribution. We plan to offer a variation of all of these items at The 52nd Street Market however, what you get here will be limited to this campaign. Picture this, your co-worker is super jealous of your vintage milk bottle looking water bottle and wants to know where he/she can score one. Well, too bad for them, the answer is nowhere.</p>
<p>All items are safe to use and will feature the 52nd Street Market logo or 52nd Street Market Roosters on a Wire. Contributions of any level will receive our coffee punch card with the first coffee on us. For those contributing outside of the Greater Pittsburgh Area, we’ll send you our custom bumper sticker.</p>
<p>Items can be picked up by appointment (term used loosely) at The 52nd Street Market, or mailed via USPS. Please allow up to 30 days after the campaign has ended to receive your items. We realize this is kind of a long time to wait for your goods but thank you in advance for your patience. We’re two ladies trying to do a whole lot!</p>
<h3>The Impact!</h3>

The 52nd Street Market, LLC will serve as a one stop shop for grocery staples, fresh produce and prepared foods. Brewed coffee, limited seating and  free wi-fi for customers will also be be available. We hope our market will provide a much needed venue to get to know your neighbors. Because we wholeheartedly believe in contributing to the health of the community, we will not sell tobacco products or lottery.
The market is located on the corner of  52nd and Holmes Streets in Upper Lawrenceville, easily accessible from Butler Street and Stanton Avenue. We look forward to serving individuals who live and work in the Lawrenceville, Stanton Heights and Morningside neighborhoods! Once successful, we hope to make our model available to other neighborhoods interested in establishing a fresh retail community corner store.
Who We Are.
Opening The 52nd Street Market has been the work of Deirdre Kane and Dora Walmsley, we’re two residents of Upper Lawrenceville who want to ensure this rapidly revitalizing neighborhood maintains its local charm. We hope to accomplish this by providing opportunities for residents through employment, education and good, healthy food.
In Our Words.
Hi, I’m Deirdre, a Lawrenceville native.  I  began to more fully invest in the community by participating in Lawrenceville United’s monthly clean ups.  My volunteering expanded into joining committees to get more directly involved in the transformation of the neighborhood.  In 2009, I was  voted onto the Board of Lawrenceville United and remain an active Board Member today. It was my involvement in the community which lead directly to the creation of The 52nd Street Market. I decided Lawrenceville was not only going to be my home, but my future. I really want to be a part of the neighborhood fabric!
Hiya, I’m Dora, a transplant who grew up north of Pittsburgh. I’ve lived in Lawrenceville since 2008 and, most recently, purchased my first home just a few blocks from what soon will be The 52nd Street Market. While moving into the neighborhood I recall a roofer, working nearby, calling down and welcoming me to the neighborhood. This sense of community and willingness to know your neighbors is what drew me in and left me wanting to do more. Since then, I’ve volunteered with numerous community groups and was recently elected onto the Board of Directors for Lawrenceville United.
Together, we have 25 years of restaurant industry and food service experience. Our experience and knowledge will inform food preparation, inventory management and stellar customer service. We also know nothing is created in a vacuum and have derived much of our business plan from community meetings, surveys and many professional mentors who have graced us with their time and expertise. As an employee at Greater Pittsburgh Food Bank, Dora works directly with food insecurity and equitable access to food. In addition to providing a convenient location for neighbors to get their grocery basics, The 52nd Street Market hopes to also make healthy food accessible, affordable and inclusive. Deirdre, has worked at Highmark for the past 15 years and is working to connect community health to community assets. We believe that a neighborhood can provide all the resources and support needed to make families and individuals successful. The 52nd Street Market will serve its part by providing healthy food options and a platform to get to know your neighbors.
Why Do This.
As ‘accidental entrepreneurs’ neither one of us had envisioned running a community corner store as part of our future. When the opportunity presented itself however, the momentum, passion, and commitment was there and it just felt right. We feel we have the skill sets and ability to make The 52nd Street Market a viable business.  However, starting a business requires a significant amount of capital and your contributions will provide critical start-up funds. We have invested a substantial amount of time and personal money, and now are asking for your support. We hope, by doing so, you’ll feel personally invested in our success and the success of the neighborhood.
What We’re Asking For.
We’re bargain hunters by nature and have worked tirelessly to keep costs and our environmental impact low. The building owner has also worked with us to build out the space, provide the use of existing coolers and has agreed to a graduated lease - all at no additional cost to us. We’re still in need of substantial start-up funds and look to raise $50,000 which will be used to purchase start-up inventory, equipment and an additional cooler to store deli meats (A must have as expressed by over 100 residents!). To also help keep initial costs low, we are keeping our full-time jobs and will employ a full and part time local residents to run The Market during daylight hours. These funds will guarantee those salaries.
Funds will go towards purchasing:

Initial inventory and inventory purchase reserve
Equipment including point of sales system, refurbished refrigeration units, coffee brewing system and coffee grinder, scales, meat slicer .
Furniture including seating, shelving storage, counter tops and food prep space.
6 Month salary reserve for employees

In Addition to Our Deepest Thanks...
We think we’ve put together some pretty awesome incentives in exchange for your contribution. We plan to offer a variation of all of these items at The 52nd Street Market however, what you get here will be limited to this campaign. Picture this, your co-worker is super jealous of your vintage milk bottle looking water bottle and wants to know where he/she can score one. Well, too bad for them, the answer is nowhere.
All items are safe to use and will feature the 52nd Street Market logo or 52nd Street Market Roosters on a Wire. Contributions of any level will receive our coffee punch card with the first coffee on us. For those contributing outside of the Greater Pittsburgh Area, we’ll send you our custom bumper sticker.
Items can be picked up by appointment (term used loosely) at The 52nd Street Market, or mailed via USPS. Please allow up to 30 days after the campaign has ended to receive your items. We realize this is kind of a long time to wait for your goods but thank you in advance for your patience. We’re two ladies trying to do a whole lot!
The Impact!
In short, your contribution will allow us to avoid the risks associated with taking out a loan. While this endeavor will hopefully provide a livelihood for us in the long term, we are acting on behalf of the community and are asking for your financial contribution in return. If successful, we hope our model can positively impact communities in Pittsburgh and beyond!

Since opening our doors in 1964, each and every day we have provided space for AA and NA meetings along with the ""meetings between meetings"" where those suffering can connect and develop friendships with others who have been there themselves and successfully turned their lives around.  We give freely to the newcomer what was freely given to us and keep what we have by giving it away.   </p>
<p>Currently we provide space for 37 meetings a week, serving 100’s of men and women. We are open early in the morning and close late at night – 365 days a year. We’re the oldest club of our kind in Dade County and one of the oldest in the country and the world.  Over the last 50 years we have positively impacted the lives of thousands upon thousands of men and woman afflicted with alcoholism and drug addiction and served thousands more of thier family and friends.</p>
<p>Located in Miami, Florida we are privileged to have met thousands of recovering vacationer’s and business travelers from every state in the country, as well as many other countries around the world. Our members have countless stories of attending AA or NA meetings from South Dakota to South Africa or Pittsburgh to Paris - and joyfully meeting someone that has either been to the Club or knows of our welcoming reputation and spirit.</p>

<p>""Little River Club saved my life 14 and 1/2 years ago…..my blood runs through with  Little River sobriety because the people there never gave up on me. I was asked to do service work to help others and as a result I have a life beyond anything I could have imagined. We take in broken and dying people and allow new life to be breathed into them by the process that occurs within the walls. The club is an unparalleled asset to Miami.        Annie P.

<p>In late 2011, after almost 50 years of service, we came to the club one morning to find the entrance to our parking lot (behind our building) blocked by a cement barricade. Overnight and without warning, via a directive from the city’s council where we reside (as part of a new initiative to accommodate increased pedestrian walkways) all traffic was cut off from entering our parking lot.  </p>

<p>Also included in the directive were our additional parking places, located on the street in front, which were designated as a no-parking zone as well.  </p>
<p>On that one morning the all-too-familiar story of “the little guy versus city hall” and the politics of “us versus them “ had officially begun.  And just as familiar, the story of contacting attorneys, ensuing legal battles, community groups expressing outrage on the steps of city hall, inside court rooms, and at city council meetings, as well as local media involvement – all followed.  </p>
<p>For the last year and a half we’ve pursued a solution, via city hall, thru attorneys, politicians and court proceedings, spent tens of thousands of dollars and invested countless hours, all the while being met with resistance and a blanket denial for regaining access to our parking lot in the manner we’ve enjoyed for the last 22 years. During the last 18 months, for the first time in our history, we have watched our membership slowly decline.  Our members and guests have simply been<br/>forced to seek more convenient meeting places. Lack of reasonable access to the Club has tried and tested even some of our most loyal members and ardent supporters.  All of them promising to return, waiting for promised changes.  Well those changes are at hand and we truly need your help.    </p>
<p><br/><b>THE PROJECT:</b></p>
<p>The solution to re-opening our parking lot and saving our Club is through a multi-phase construction project that entails tearing down the east-end of our building and putting in a driveway to provide thru access via the street running in front of our business (79<sup>th</sup> Street).</p>
<p>This project will require great leadership and a lot of work and coordination that includes but is not limited to:</p>
<p><strong>CONSTRUCTION:</strong></p>
<p>Demolition of far, east-end of building </p>
<p>Electrical, plumbing, roofing, interior upgrades</p>
<p>Implementing drive-way from street to parking lot</p>
<p>Building a concrete wall - 125 ft X 6 ft high</p>
<p>Expanding existing parking lot<br/></p>
<p><strong>VOLUNTEERING:</strong></p>
<p>This is also a great project for our volunteers who are inspired and dedicated to doing whatever it takes to get the job done.<span>  A wide cross-section of our general </span><span>membership, with varied skills and resources, will donate their time, services (and sometimes goods) at no cost to the project.</span></p>
<p>Their only reward is the satisfaction that they will know they’ve helped in part to ensure the continuation of our solemn tradition of helping those in need and then providing those same people with the opportunity to pass on the gift of recovery to others in the future.<span>  They get to keep their gift by giving it away.</span></p>
<p><br/> <strong>OVERVIEW:</strong></p>
<p>The overall project is estimated to cost $180,000.  The work will be conducted over a 7-month period, broken down into three (3) phases, each costing $60,000. To show our appreciation we will be providing special gifts, each corresponding with the level of your generous donation.  This site currently reflects only our introductory-story and our initial plans to move the project forward.

<p><em>This campaign is raising funds on behalf on 2nd Bothwell Scout Group which is a member of the Scout Association (UK). As such we are a registered charity in the UK. Unfortunately, since we are based in the UK this campaign cannot be verified as nonprofit by Indiegogo. All contributions will however go directly to 2nd Bothwell Scout Group.<br/><br/></em></p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<div>2nd Bothwell Scout Group are based in Glasgow, Scotland. We've been established since 1919 - only twelve years after Scouting was born! We currently have over 50 members who are aged from 8 all the way up to 17 years old. The Group is completely voluntary and is supported by 6 leaders.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In 2005 we decided to change our Neckie of Green and White and adopt the Modern Douglas Tartan. As a Scottish troop we felt a tartan neckie was more apt. Modern Douglas was chosen as it was the Tartan worn by the Cameronians, Lanarkshires own army regiment with a historical base in Hamilton. Until 2008, Hamilton was the Scout District we fell under.</div>
<div> </div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<div>The Group currently has only one tent which was gifted to us by another Scout Group. We have used this tent for the past few years at summer camps and at jamborees where Scouts from around the World meet up. Unfortunately, this tent is over 25 years old and as such is no longer suitable as it does not provide enough protection from the wind and rain - especially on week long camps!</div>
<div> </div>
<div style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt=""Scout Patrol Tent"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://images.gotwoggle.com.s3.amazonaws.com/3869_ice_m.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Scout Patrol Tent""/></div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are therefore looking to secure funding to help purchase two new tents. This will enable us to replace our existing tent as well as increase the number of people who can attend camps/jamborees. The tents that we are hoping to purchase are the 'old fashioned' canvas style Scout Patrol tent. These tents are made from heavy duty canvas and will easily last over 20 years. <strong><em>Therefore your contribution will have a lasting effect and will benefit both current and future members of the Scout Group!</em></strong>

2nd Bothwell Scout Group are based in Glasgow, Scotland. We've been established since 1919 - only twelve years after Scouting was born! We currently have over 50 members who are aged from 8 all the way up to 17 years old. The Group is completely voluntary and is supported by 6 leaders.
 
In 2005 we decided to change our Neckie of Green and White and adopt the Modern Douglas Tartan. As a Scottish troop we felt a tartan neckie was more apt. Modern Douglas was chosen as it was the Tartan worn by the Cameronians, Lanarkshires own army regiment with a historical base in Hamilton. Until 2008, Hamilton was the Scout District we fell under.
 


The Project
The Group currently has only one tent which was gifted to us by another Scout Group. We have used this tent for the past few years at summer camps and at jamborees where Scouts from around the World meet up. Unfortunately, this tent is over 25 years old and as such is no longer suitable as it does not provide enough protection from the wind and rain - especially on week long camps!
 

 
We are therefore looking to secure funding to help purchase two new tents. This will enable us to replace our existing tent as well as increase the number of people who can attend camps/jamborees. The tents that we are hoping to purchase are the 'old fashioned' canvas style Scout Patrol tent. These tents are made from heavy duty canvas and will easily last over 20 years. Therefore your contribution will have a lasting effect and will benefit both current and future members of the Scout Group!

<p>We believe that it is our collective responsibility to raise

in mind:</p>
<h3>
<i>1) Gift Experiences</i>.  </h3><p>You will have the opportunity to gift an experience, to inspire your
child's creativity and talent.  Toys capture a child's attention for a short period - experiences can shape
a lifetime.</p>

invite friends and family into your virtual village, so that they can
participate in your child's growth and inspire their talents and dreams.

<li>This year, our Unified Volleyball Team has been invited to play at the US Volleyball Invitational in Phoenix, Arizona!  This trip has to be funded by our local program.  We hope to help them realize this dream!</li>
<li>This year, for the first time in many years, we are sending Athletes to the Special Olympics USA Games in New Jersey.  We hope to offset some of the costs associated with this so our Athletes can focus on the competition!</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Equipment!  We have teams in many sports (Soccer, Basketball, Bocce, Cycling, Cheerleading, Equestrian, Aquatics, Athletics...just to name a few) and they need good, serviceable equipment.  Some of what we have is donated but often we have to come out of pocket for replacement items.</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Uniforms!  Every Athlete in every sport needs to have a jersey or uniform that sets them apart, that tells the WORLD who they are and why they have so much pride!  Our Athletes are no different.</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Reimbursement of volunteer expenses.  We have a few sports (Equestrian and Cycling come to mind) that are VERY logistically intense.  We like to help offset our volunteers' out of pocket costs as much as possible.  Consider what it takes to support an Equestrian team with 10 Riders that have to practice every week for ten weeks and then move ALL the horses and equipment to and from our State Tournament.  Every little bit helps.</span></li>

This year, for the first time in many years, we are sending Athletes to the Special Olympics USA Games in New Jersey.  We hope to offset some of the costs associated with this so our Athletes can focus on the competition!
Equipment!  We have teams in many sports (Soccer, Basketball, Bocce, Cycling, Cheerleading, Equestrian, Aquatics, Athletics...just to name a few) and they need good, serviceable equipment.  Some of what we have is donated but often we have to come out of pocket for replacement items.
Uniforms!  Every Athlete in every sport needs to have a jersey or uniform that sets them apart, that tells the WORLD who they are and why they have so much pride!  Our Athletes are no different.
Reimbursement of volunteer expenses.  We have a few sports (Equestrian and Cycling come to mind) that are VERY logistically intense.  We like to help offset our volunteers' out of pocket costs as much as possible.  Consider what it takes to support an Equestrian team with 10 Riders that have to practice every week for ten weeks and then move ALL the horses and equipment to and from our State Tournament.  Every little bit helps.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Andrew Barnett, I am the owner operator of ""Friends Not Food Ltd"".</p>
<p>For the past 14 years I have worked in hospitality in Inverness in various roles from waiting staff to general manager. About 4 years ago I decided to turn vegetarian and quickly realised I missed my favourite food - Haggis. Not quite content with the vegetarian alternatives I set out to make a vegan haggis that tasted and felt like the real deal. The success of doing this inspired me to continue re inventing the foods that we all miss, inspired me to go vegan and ultimately to open a cafe/restaurant that would both inspire and delight vegans and also be accessible to omnivores and carnivores.   </p>
<p>On the 1st December we will get the keys to our beautiful new city centre premises, and that is when the hard work will start. This campaign will help to fit our kitchen, build our bar and furnish our place with tables and chairs etc. Your contribution and the success of this campaign will help to make the difference between being a place for vegans, and being the coolest place in town that just happens to be 100% vegan.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have placed a goal of £500 as that is the minimum. I have put my life savings in to this venture as I am extremely passionate about what we do and determined to make a success of it. Your contributions and support will determine the degree of that success.</p>
<p>We understand that people don't like to fork out, so to sweeten the deal we have a range of benefits up for grabs from coffee, merchandise, food and drink to Lifetime discounts!</p>
<p>The campaign is scheduled to end in the first week of December and all rewards will be available in time for Christmas presents!</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any new cafe or restaurant there may be risks and challenges, however I feel we are in a beneficial start point for several reasons. Having operated pop up restaurant evenings and running stalls at food and craft fairs we have an established customer base from which to build on.</p>
<p>We have been approached several times when doing pop ups by local journalists who are keen to run a story about the first vegan restaurant or cafe in Inverness and along with Inverness Bid, WhatsHappening Inverness, Vegan Inverness and our own followers I believe we will have lots of excitement and anticipation from free advertising and word of mouth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Further more I believe that my time within the hospitality trade has given me the knowledge and experience necessary to navigate this challenging road ahead.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone is able to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't get involved and help out.</p>
<p>You can share this campaign on social media and amongst your friends and families, talk about what we are planning to do, and shout about the need for a vegan place in the capital of the highlands. </p>

<p>Research suggests that once you start doing nice things for other people, you won't want to stop. Studies have proven giving to others makes us happy, maybe even happier than spending on ourselves. There is some evidence that being habitually altruistic raises dopamine levels in the brain, which leaves people feeling a sense of calm, greater self-worth, an absence of emotional stress, and generally happier. In addition, scientists have discovered ‘mirror neurons’ in the brain that mimic what people see on the faces of others so that they can feel what those others are feeling. Being kind is contagious, creating a ripple effect that truly has no end, making the world a kinder place.</p>

<h1>How the money will be utilized</h1>
<p>Here are some estimated costs so people can see where our money will be spent.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Work Space</strong> - We'll need to rent a space to work in that has a few power outlets we can use. $100 per weekend * 3 weekends = $300.</li>
<li>
<strong>5' x 5' Storage Space</strong> -  To keep the computers, monitors, and accessories. $70 per month.</li>
<li>
<strong>Teaching Materials </strong>- When we go onsite we'll train staff. We think we'll make that experience better with some printed materials, a whiteboard, and some paper. $60</li>
<li>
<strong>Transportation, Parking </strong>- We need gas to fuel the cars that we will use to transport computers, and money to cover parking costs. $45</li>
<li>
<strong>Odds and Ends</strong> - We will need to purchase power strips, mice, mouse pads, networking equipment, etc. $100</li>

</div></div>","Here's the plan


Assemble a group of individuals that are passionate about tech and donating it to people and organizations in need.
Reach out to schools, libraries, homeless shelters, and community centers and determine what essential software they need on the computers.

Gather donated equipment.
Do the work. Install Linux and other free and open source software. 

Deliver and train staff at the site on how to make use of their new equipment.
Follow #techrehabnj on Twitter to see what we do

How the money will be utilized
Here are some estimated costs so people can see where our money will be spent.


Work Space - We'll need to rent a space to work in that has a few power outlets we can use. $100 per weekend * 3 weekends = $300.

5' x 5' Storage Space -  To keep the computers, monitors, and accessories. $70 per month.

Teaching Materials - When we go onsite we'll train staff. We think we'll make that experience better with some printed materials, a whiteboard, and some paper. $60

Transportation, Parking - We need gas to fuel the cars that we will use to transport computers, and money to cover parking costs. $45

Odds and Ends - We will need to purchase power strips, mice, mouse pads, networking equipment, etc. $100

<p>We started a group with a bunch of people from the UAE interested in being involved with communities. The aim of this group is to work with communities helping in their development and empowerment making them sustainable in the long run. The NGO we are working with for this current project KYEMPAPU based in Central Uganda shares a common objective with us which is to mitigate climate change and promote environmentally conscious behavior. In 2011 KYEMPAPU received the Environment award at the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.actnow.fi/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""ENO Act Now Conference""><em>Eno Act Now Forest Conference</em></a></span> in Finland. Some of their other objectives are to work towards community cohesion, empowering the youth by education and promote the importance of healthcare and sanitation. In this current project we want to help them raise funds for one of their community development programs to be held on the International Women's Day. The objective is to empower the women of the society by involving them in different activities throughout the day and communicating the importance of women in the society.</p>
<h3><strong style=""font-size: 10px;"">What we want to do</strong></h3>
<p>Women from different towns/districts will be involved in this event. The day will host a number of events including the likes of planting trees, environmental advocacy, discussions about domestic violence against women, netball games, crafts making by women, etc. </p>
<p><strong>Why it is important</strong></p>
<p>Community unity is an integral step towards development and growth. One can achieve this through creating a platform for interaction between the different members of the community. Communication and sharing of ideas are key aspects in this road towards development which is why it is so important for us to organize this event. The main goal of this day would be to create <em>Unity among women from different communities and Talk about i</em>deas on <em>how to handle gender based violence</em>. It would also lead to <em>increased number of trees planted in the community.</em> Since there is a problem of illiteracy among the youth of the community, it is important that direct communication is involved to discuss social issues like the one mentioned above. Through the course of discussions and activities involving and revolving around women, a clear message will be sent out to the community on the role and importance of women.</p>
<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p>For the entire event, we require about US $2200. Most of it goes into buying seedlings for tree planting. A part of the fund will be required for providing food and drinks for the day, renting tents, chairs etc., paying the staff and the press and basic transportation needs.</p>
<p>The community is faced with another problem of large number of teenaged girls dropping out of school due to the unavailability of proper sanitation. They do not have enough money to buy sanitary towels and thus, abstain from school during their period to avoid being made fun of by the boys when their clothes have blood stains. This eventually leads to early age marriages in most cases as the girls usually stay home and are uneducated. In order to overcome this issue our team would be developing an educational program on sanitation and health for young kids at school. Through skype meetings or sending over the program structure to the teachers at the local schools, we aim to overcome this problem. In the meantime the funds that are in excess to the pledged amount will be used to buy sanitary napkins for the 800 odd school girls in 3 schools in the Masaka district.</p>
<p><strong>What you get</strong></p>
<p>Of course all this is only possible by your generosity. Your donations will not only make this event a reality but also achieve more long term goals of Women Empowerment and Community Cohesion. The event involves a lot of tree plantings helping achieve the community their long term goal of climate change mitigation.</p>
<p> In order to show you our appreciation for your endeavoring support and trust in us we are setting up a system for perks based on your contributions. Check out the right panel for a list of what you can get.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways you can help</strong></p>
<p>We understand that it’s not always possible to contribute monetarily even though one has the urge to make a difference. Don’t worry, we have something else in mind for you. Post the link on your social media pages including Indiegogo share tools and promote our campaign to all your friends and colleagues. </p></div>","Who are we

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is David Reese and I have a Smokehouse. I make BBQ, and Seafood. I also have a catering licensce. I am from Memphis, TN and I encorporate that background into my BBQ.</p>
<p>Here on Cape Cod, we have long summers and even longer winters. We also have lots of people who leave Cape Cod because they are having a hard time finding a job. Finding work is never easy but in this particular economy it is even harder, especially on the Cape. With this vision, we can change that.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Department of Agriculture, we now have a way to keep our business running year round. It's called the Farm-to-School Program. This program allows selective small busineeses (that qaulify) such as ourselves to sell our Seafood drirectly to the schools in the Commonwealth of Massachussetts.</p>
<p>With this new program, we went out and did taste testings at schools all over the Cape and the results are in. 90% of the students said they wanted our seafood cakes, casseroles, seafood (shepherd's) pies as part of their lunches.</p>
<p>There are over 400 school districts in the Commonwealth, we have 6 schools lined up and we are on our way to contracting many more.</p>
<p>Right now, our equipment can process hundreds of our seafood products in a day, we want to change that to thousands. But to do that, we need equipment and that is why we are fundraising.</p>
<p>Which is where you come in. By contributing to our goal, you will be helping us purchase new equipment to make, process, sell, and deliver our products to the schools. With this new equipment, our business will be able to provide year round work in a pleasant working environment with good wages to the everyday person.</p>
<p>Help us make it possible for people to live on Cape Cod!</p>

Hello,
My name is David Reese and I have a Smokehouse. I make BBQ, and Seafood. I also have a catering licensce. I am from Memphis, TN and I encorporate that background into my BBQ.
Here on Cape Cod, we have long summers and even longer winters. We also have lots of people who leave Cape Cod because they are having a hard time finding a job. Finding work is never easy but in this particular economy it is even harder, especially on the Cape. With this vision, we can change that.
Thanks to the Department of Agriculture, we now have a way to keep our business running year round. It's called the Farm-to-School Program. This program allows selective small busineeses (that qaulify) such as ourselves to sell our Seafood drirectly to the schools in the Commonwealth of Massachussetts.
With this new program, we went out and did taste testings at schools all over the Cape and the results are in. 90% of the students said they wanted our seafood cakes, casseroles, seafood (shepherd's) pies as part of their lunches.
There are over 400 school districts in the Commonwealth, we have 6 schools lined up and we are on our way to contracting many more.
Right now, our equipment can process hundreds of our seafood products in a day, we want to change that to thousands. But to do that, we need equipment and that is why we are fundraising.
Which is where you come in. By contributing to our goal, you will be helping us purchase new equipment to make, process, sell, and deliver our products to the schools. With this new equipment, our business will be able to provide year round work in a pleasant working environment with good wages to the everyday person.
Help us make it possible for people to live on Cape Cod!

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Hi, I'm Deborah Fisher. I have 25 years of design and sewing experience and am the Director of the non-profit Bright Hopes Collaborative Quilt Project.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’m working with an amazing group of women to build a new non-profit organization called Bo Twal -- “cloth kiss” in Haitian Creole -- and we’re reaching out to you to help us fund the launch. Our mission is twofold: First, we’ll provide lovely, soft, handmade cloth dolls to children in underdeveloped countries. Second, we’ll create a much-needed source of income in these countries for members of the sewing cooperatives that will be making and distributing the dolls. Our project will begin in Haiti and expand to other countries.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Our Financial Plan</h2>
<p>With the exception of this campaign and our initial launch, our organization is designed to be self-sustaining. We’ll accomplish this through the sale of doll patterns and kits (the first of which is our “Sewing Smiles” pattern), offered via our web page and our Etsy site.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>We need to raise $2,450 for our launch of Bo Twal. These funds will be used for:</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$1,150 for the first print run of “Sewing Smiles” doll patterns<br/>
</li>
<li>$255 for the initial production of 20 dolls<br/>
</li>
<li>$475 to cover the costs of incorporating as a nonprofit<br/>
</li>
<li>$570 to cover our attorney, accountant, and other professional fees<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If we do not meet our goal, we’ll scale back the size of our launch as needed. If we raise more than our goal, we’ll increase our initial production run to 50 dolls (or more) and consult with an additional nonprofit professional to assist with our incorporation paperwork.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>To Thank You for Your Support</h2>
<p>We have a number of delightful perks to thank you for your donation. Depending on your level of support, we’ll send you: a mini Bo Twal tote bag; a mini doll that’s been designed especially for our launch campaign; your own full-size “Sewing Smiles” doll; or a combination of these items for larger contributions.</p>

Not surprisingly, this idea worked! After one year of successful business, She Moves Mountains has hosted 40 clinics and worked with over 300 women and counting. Not to mention, created an increasingly prevalent scholarship program called The JoJo scholarship that funds one new woman a month to participate in a clinic for an entire year.  </p>
<p>Now, we want to create this on the east coast, starting with Chattanooga, Tennessee.</p>
<p>Chattanooga will be the center point, serving women from Atlanta, Nashville, Asheville, Memphis, Knoxville, Huntsville, Birmingham and other surrounding cities. Your favorite clinics from She Moves Mountains Pacific Northwest will be held here.</p>

<p>We will be hosting five different clinic types from September-May.</p>
<p>These instructional clinics will be taught by an all-female staff of professional rock climbing guides certified through the American Mountain Guide Association.</p>
<p>Our clinics are for all levels of experience from the beginner climber who has never put on rock climbing shoes to the daily crusher at the gym looking to broaden her abilities on sport or trad outside. Meanwhile, we're creating a community of confident women who can dominate whatever objective they set their mind towards. </p>
<p><strong>To make this happen we need a little help. Here's what your donation will go towards.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>1. Equipment</p>
<p>We want to offer gear essentials to our clients without any additional cost. That includes:</p>
<p>·       Adjustable Harnesses</p>
<p>·       Helmets</p>
<p>·       Rock Climbing Shoes</p>
<p>·       Belay Devices</p>
<p>·       Rock Climbing Ropes </p>
<p>·       Quickdraws </p>
<p>·       Steel Locking Carabiners</p>
<p>·       Anchor Setups  </p>
<p>·       Non-Locking Carabiners</p>
<p>·       Traditional Climbing Equipment</p>
<p>·       Crashpads</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. Guide Training</p>
<p>This entails the ability to bring in a certified guide from the AMGA with a higher certification to help with extensive guide training and education.</p>
<p>3. Miscellaneous</p>
<p>We will need funds for liability insurance, licensing, crag maintenance, marketing, and money to cover the cost of this campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><u><strong>The Impact</strong></u></h2>
<p>The purpose of women-specific events is not to exclude men; it is to uplift and empower women. </p>
<p>We live in a world where women are underrepresented in leadership roles across the board - from the outdoor industry and guiding to government and top executives or CEO's. According to the American Mountain Guide Association, less than 12% of certified climbing guides are female.</p>
<p>As female rock climbers, guides, and business owners - She Moves Mountains is our opportunity to challenge this disparity. Our hope is that our work will encourage other women to do the same. She Moves Mountains provides opportunities to grow as rock climbers, but the dream is that climbing will give women the confidence to take on any challenge. </p>
<p>The business model of She Moves Mountains is a proven success and is one of the many reasons why we want to bring this to the East Coast. We feel these opportunities could benefit an innumerable amount of women on our side of the country just like it has for people in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Here are some thoughts from Chattanooga climbers who believe in the importance of these clinics:</p>
<p><i>""Climbing has been dominated by males for a long time.  Males and females are completely different when it comes to their bodies, obviously.  Getting training advice from a male rock climber will provide some useful tips but getting that advice from another female would be more beneficial in the long run.  Having women-specific clinics makes it easier for females to ask different questions and be more open.  We are wired differently - so getting advice and tips from other females will ultimately get us to the results we are looking for faster."" </i></p>
<p><strong>Kasia Pietras, Regional Director of Route Setting at MetroRock Climbing Gym</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>""Female climbers are equally as capable as their male counterparts. We see this proven every day in our local gyms, at the crag or boulder field, and during competitions. That being said, the methods in which male and female climbers approach, consume, interpret, and apply climbing and training skills can vary greatly. </i></p>
<p><i>At its core, education, regardless of the topic, is entirely about finding the best method of learning, understanding, and application of knowledge. The folks at She Moves Mountains are making climbing education accessible and approachable for women in environments where they have been traditionally underrepresented."" </i></p>
<p><strong>Cody Grodzki, Director of Route Setting at High Point Climbing Gym</strong></p>

<h3>Why Contribute?</h3>
<p>Put simply, we love what we do and want to share it with others. The empowerment gained from our rock climbing clinics will give the women of our community a foundation and confidence to take on any challenge.</p>

</div></div>","Who We Are

When this company was created, donors in the Pacific North West invested in giving women the opportunity to take the feeling of empowerment for themselves. Not surprisingly, this idea worked! After one year of successful business, She Moves Mountains has hosted 40 clinics and worked with over 300 women and counting. Not to mention, created an increasingly prevalent scholarship program called The JoJo scholarship that funds one new woman a month to participate in a clinic for an entire year.  
Now, we want to create this on the east coast, starting with Chattanooga, Tennessee.
Chattanooga will be the center point, serving women from Atlanta, Nashville, Asheville, Memphis, Knoxville, Huntsville, Birmingham and other surrounding cities. Your favorite clinics from She Moves Mountains Pacific Northwest will be held here.

We will be hosting five different clinic types from September-May.
These instructional clinics will be taught by an all-female staff of professional rock climbing guides certified through the American Mountain Guide Association.
Our clinics are for all levels of experience from the beginner climber who has never put on rock climbing shoes to the daily crusher at the gym looking to broaden her abilities on sport or trad outside. Meanwhile, we're creating a community of confident women who can dominate whatever objective they set their mind towards. 
To make this happen we need a little help. Here's what your donation will go towards.

 
1. Equipment
We want to offer gear essentials to our clients without any additional cost. That includes:
·       Adjustable Harnesses
·       Helmets
·       Rock Climbing Shoes
·       Belay Devices
·       Rock Climbing Ropes 
·       Quickdraws 
·       Steel Locking Carabiners
·       Anchor Setups  
·       Non-Locking Carabiners
·       Traditional Climbing Equipment
·       Crashpads
 
2. Guide Training
This entails the ability to bring in a certified guide from the AMGA with a higher certification to help with extensive guide training and education.
3. Miscellaneous
We will need funds for liability insurance, licensing, crag maintenance, marketing, and money to cover the cost of this campaign.
 
The Impact
The purpose of women-specific events is not to exclude men; it is to uplift and empower women. 
We live in a world where women are underrepresented in leadership roles across the board - from the outdoor industry and guiding to government and top executives or CEO's. According to the American Mountain Guide Association, less than 12% of certified climbing guides are female.
As female rock climbers, guides, and business owners - She Moves Mountains is our opportunity to challenge this disparity. Our hope is that our work will encourage other women to do the same. She Moves Mountains provides opportunities to grow as rock climbers, but the dream is that climbing will give women the confidence to take on any challenge. 
The business model of She Moves Mountains is a proven success and is one of the many reasons why we want to bring this to the East Coast. We feel these opportunities could benefit an innumerable amount of women on our side of the country just like it has for people in the Pacific Northwest.
Here are some thoughts from Chattanooga climbers who believe in the importance of these clinics:
""Climbing has been dominated by males for a long time.  Males and females are completely different when it comes to their bodies, obviously.  Getting training advice from a male rock climber will provide some useful tips but getting that advice from another female would be more beneficial in the long run.  Having women-specific clinics makes it easier for females to ask different questions and be more open.  We are wired differently - so getting advice and tips from other females will ultimately get us to the results we are looking for faster."" 
Kasia Pietras, Regional Director of Route Setting at MetroRock Climbing Gym
 
""Female climbers are equally as capable as their male counterparts. We see this proven every day in our local gyms, at the crag or boulder field, and during competitions. That being said, the methods in which male and female climbers approach, consume, interpret, and apply climbing and training skills can vary greatly. 
At its core, education, regardless of the topic, is entirely about finding the best method of learning, understanding, and application of knowledge. The folks at She Moves Mountains are making climbing education accessible and approachable for women in environments where they have been traditionally underrepresented."" 
Cody Grodzki, Director of Route Setting at High Point Climbing Gym
 

Why Contribute?
Put simply, we love what we do and want to share it with others. The empowerment gained from our rock climbing clinics will give the women of our community a foundation and confidence to take on any challenge.
Please help us in our endeavor.

</h3><ul>
<li>At
 this point, I need money to cover past expenses I incurred while 
teaching my classes. These expenses included classroom rental, class 
materials (including handouts), equipment such as computers and printers, and financing for attending professional conferences to network with my Tarot colleagues. The last thing I want to do is to raise my class fees or start charging monthly dues to the members of my Meetup group.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>I'm
 offering Tarot readings of varying lengths and free access to some of 
my classes, including the in-person classes in Manhattan, the online 
Webinar versions of these same classes, recordings of past online 
classes, and private Tarot lessons.<b> Once you choose a perk, either a Tarot reading or class, you can schedule a reading at any time that is convenient for you or take any available class. The perks have no time limits, except those that have a year or more duration, and that duration is based on the timing of the first reading or class.</b><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>I have based my goal on

 fall short of that goal, any money I receive will go toward paying off 
these expenses. I would be extremely grateful for any help you can give me.<br/>
</li>
</ul><h3>Why Tarot Classes Are Important<br/>
</h3>In
 my humble opinion, Tarot is one of the best tools for self examination 
and for helping you to figure out your own path through the maze of 
life. I know from my own experience at studying Tarot that you learn a 
whole lot more than just how to read the cards. You learn about yourself. It becomes a 
life-affirming vehicle that you can also use to help other people find 
their way through life. I'm also hoping that my students are discovering
 these wonders of Tarot; and the feedback that I'm getting is that they 
are.<br/><br/><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Please share this campaign with your friends or use the Indiegogo share tools to get the word out. I'm slowly but surely developing a reputation as an excellent Tarot instructor and insightful Tarot reader. I just need a little help to keep my business up and running while I penetrate the market further. I would be grateful for any help you can give me and not just money.

materials (including handouts), equipment such as computers and printers, and financing for attending professional conferences to network with my Tarot colleagues. The last thing I want to do is to raise my class fees or start charging monthly dues to the members of my Meetup group.

I'm
 offering Tarot readings of varying lengths and free access to some of 
my classes, including the in-person classes in Manhattan, the online 
Webinar versions of these same classes, recordings of past online 
classes, and private Tarot lessons. Once you choose a perk, either a Tarot reading or class, you can schedule a reading at any time that is convenient for you or take any available class. The perks have no time limits, except those that have a year or more duration, and that duration is based on the timing of the first reading or class.

I have based my goal on 
what cash I need to completely pay off past expenses. However, even if I
 fall short of that goal, any money I receive will go toward paying off 
these expenses. I would be extremely grateful for any help you can give me.

Why Tarot Classes Are Important
In
 my humble opinion, Tarot is one of the best tools for self examination 
and for helping you to figure out your own path through the maze of 
life. I know from my own experience at studying Tarot that you learn a 
whole lot more than just how to read the cards. You learn about yourself. It becomes a 
life-affirming vehicle that you can also use to help other people find 
their way through life. I'm also hoping that my students are discovering
 these wonders of Tarot; and the feedback that I'm getting is that they 
are.Other Ways You Can HelpPlease share this campaign with your friends or use the Indiegogo share tools to get the word out. I'm slowly but surely developing a reputation as an excellent Tarot instructor and insightful Tarot reader. I just need a little help to keep my business up and running while I penetrate the market further. I would be grateful for any help you can give me and not just money. Thank you for your consideration.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Help Fund          an Experiment in Generosity!
A      dedicated group of Chico residents is building something new and      exciting: 100th Monkey Community Cafe        -- a nonprofit, Pay-As-You-Can cafe. By reaching our      fund-raising goal of $30,000, we will      join      45 other cafes in the U.S. in this farm-to-table, community cafe      movement. Our Community Cafe Task Force is working hard to make      this      happen, and we are asking for your help in the form of a financial      donation at any level you can give.
What Is          a ""Pay-As-You-Can Community Cafe?
The community cafe model is based        on a sound         and        just economic principle:     If everybody            gives what they have, everybody gets what they need.

It is a full HR Management system that carries a job board and a career &amp; recruitment services application as a plus. Moreover, the embedded job board / career &amp; recruitment services application will be a combination of most of the popular competitors across the web. This makes NJL a one stop solution for every organization's full HR needs. Despite all the above, the cost of using NJL is currently set to be less than the average cost of all its competitors. Our main goal is to help organizations save time and money so that they can focus on growth. When they grow, they expand and find the need to hire more talents and therefore reduce the unemployment rate - We all can one day get a job.</span></p>

This makes NJL a one stop solution for every organization's full HR needs. Despite all the above, the cost of using NJL is currently set to be less than the average cost of all its competitors. Our main goal is to help organizations save time and money so that they can focus on growth. When they grow, they expand and find the need to hire more talents and therefore reduce the unemployment rate - We all can one day get a job.
The NJL idea originated from the success of Njorku, as Temi (NJL's founder), out of her admiration for Njorku, wanted to get a little more creative by coming up with a solution that has no geographical limitation. She then brought the ideas up to Bertrand (one of Njorku's co-founders)  for further analysis and execution.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Since the height of 2009's Great Recession, I (Gregory Turner II), and countless others have struggled to find their voice, purpose and meaning to life. I got fired from a job, refused to take out another school loan for a meaningless degree; I was bogged down by what societies idea of success was for me. With my back against the wall and what felt like defeat, I asked myself where and how do I find happiness? Ah, small business ownership, fashion and retail. After a year of pop up shops and an e-commerce website, I had to find the next best thing. Witness: FRiNGE boutique, the idea of creating a unique shopping experience, through an authentic and approachable perspective.</p>

<p>This campaign embodies the idea that with passion, hard work and determination, one can fully chase their dreams as long as it is from the heart and will impact a community bigger than themselves. FRiNGE has done just that, it has and will continue to provide a medium for the likes of inspiring small businesses. Periodisa, a Columbus based publisher, will facilitate writing workshops, host book readings and sell their books in store. Artists will connect to the Short North Arts district through our designated Gallery space. Artisans and furniture makers will have an approachable and comfortable home to try entrepreneurial ventures by selling their products. Lastly and most important, we want to be an anchor and advocate for the Northern end of the Short North. The blocks between 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th </sup>avenues have struggled to become stable, with FRiNGE Boutique we will get a retail anchor and advocate that is dedicated to uplifting our community.  </p>

The former French colony, previously known as 'Upper Volta', gained its independence under this name on the 5th of August 1960. It was President Thomas Sankara who changed the name to Burkina Faso, which means 'land of the honourable' or 'honest land', on the 4th of August 1984.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/195063/files/20131113093816-Afrikakarte_BurkinaFaso.jpg?1384364296"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world. Today, despite the large range of cultural diversity and a lack of stability, the various ethnic groups live together peacefully. Regular and reoccurring drought periods are of great concern for the majority of the population, who work as farmers. <br/><br/>The current healthcare system in Burkina Faso means that the patient must pay all of their own medical costs, except when giving birth and vaccinating a child. The doctor to patient ratio is severely out of balance, and it is made even worse when factoring in the level of qualified doctors. There are thousands of people in desperate need of surgery, who simply cannot afford it. We can provide them with operations, free of charge.<br/><br/><b>Clinic concept</b><br/>The clinic will consist of 10 beds, where it will be possible to perform surgical, urological and gynaecological operations. The clinic is to be managed by Dr. Sedogo, who thanks to a scholarship provided by our foundation, trained for three years as a surgeon in Togo, as well as spending a year in Germany. The clinic will be staffed by skilled personnel who have trained, and worked together with the foundation, to provide medical aid for over 10 years. Through uniting the African culture with European medical standards, we are providing a high level of service, that is completely unique in Burkina Faso. <br/>The clinic has been built on a piece of land, given to us by the local population, in Leo. Leo is the town within which we have been successfully providing medical aid since 2001. Leo is situated on the best connected road between Ghana and the capital city of Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou, which is approximately two hours drive away. The clinic itself will be built directly on this road, therefore making it highly accessible. This is of particular importance during the rainy season.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/195068/files/20131113094026-Patenkinder.jpg?1384364426"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><b>Economic concept</b><br/>Due to the state of the Burkinian healthcare system, a clinic must be financially independent. One of the key concerns for us, is providing treatment for the patients who need it, irregardless of whether they can pay for it. There are people in Burkina Faso, in the middle or upper classes, who have no problems when it comes to paying for medical treatment. These classes tend to live in or around the capital city and can therefore easily reach the clinic. Through the provision of a high medical standard, the clinic is an attractive prospect to this group of possible patients. This means that the treatment of wealthier inhabitants can easily finance the running of the clinic, allowing the clinic to care for those who cannot afford it, free of charge.<br/><br/><b>Political Concept</b><br/>The construction of a clinic is supported whole heartedly by local politicians. This is clear from, amongst other things, the gift of the land itself on which the clinic will be built. The building of the clinic has been arranged with the Health Minister himself. Surgeons for Africa is not only a certified foundation in Germany, but also in Burkina Faso. This means that we have permission to build clinics and initiate medical aid projects, throughout the entire country.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/229275/files/20131128052928-Grundsteinlegung.jpg?1385645368"" src="""" style=""width: 253.893px; height: 169px;""/></p><b>Architectual concept</b><br/>Through a special technique, discovered by our architect Francis Kere, clay bricks are combined with concrete. These bricks are sourced from local suppliers and produced using traditional building methods, which comply with modern day structural requirements. Additional materials such as laterrite will also be used, as they fit naturally within the colours of the African landscape.<br/>Climate control is achieved through the construction of high ceilings and in particular, the unusual and exceptional roof construction. A normal roof construction blocks rising heat. Through our ingenious and innovative roof technique, the roof is constructed in a V form. This allows for the heat to be drained using a ventilation system constructed within the walls and roof. By constructing the building in such a way, it also allows for the natural wind flow to aid air extraction.<br/>This further optimises climate control within the building and functions in temperatures of up to 50 degrees. Thus creating a pleasant and comfortable environment for patients to recuperate in. During the rainy season the roof serves as an aid in collecting rainwater which is then stored in a cistern.  Thus solving one of the main, and well known, problems in the Sahel region in an effective way.<br/><br/><b>Environmental concept</b><br/>The building of the clinic should not only serve as an example of successful medical developmental aid, but also provide a workable environmental role model. The intensive use of solar energy is planned and this will fulfil a large proportion of the predicted energy expenditure. It is thanks to the donation of solar panels by the firm SolarWorld, that this is made possible. In addition to this, a biological water purifier will be installed, one of the first ever in Burkina Faso. Water needs will be met through the collection of rain water, which can then be heated using solar power. The construction of an ecological waste disposal plant is also planned.<br/><br/><p></p><h3>The Architect</h3><p></p>After our decision to build a surgical clinic in Burkina Faso, and with high hopes that we would be able to finance and complete such a project, the search began for a suitable architect.<br/>It was whilst working with the late popular film and theatre director <a href=""http://www.schlingensief.com/index_eng.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Christoph Schlingensief</a>, who is well known thanks to his work on the African Opera House Project in Burkina Faso, that I came to meet Francis Kéré.

<p>My
name is Cody Harrison and my goal as an entrepreneur is to help solve the water and energy
crises we are entering. </p>
<p>Despite all of the media
attention on preserving the global environment, there is still a huge problem
that gets less attention than it deserves: the rapid build-up of waste-water,

<p>Not only is our fresh water

animal feedlot operations (CAFOs), stick water from animal rendering plants

among others. Around the globe, treatment systems struggle to keep pace and
often operate based on the premise that “dilution is the solution.” As a

<p>If we don't meet our goal we will still begin
the process, and simply go as far as the money takes us. The first step is
hiring a mechanical engineer to create the CAD (computer-aided design) drawings
of the new reactor (should cost less than $10k). Next we have the sensors +
wifi installed (this will cost ~$20k). Next the software development must take
place (another $20k). The materials and assembly for the reactor itself will
actually be less than $500 (graphene and nanotubes will make the next one
slightly more expensive). </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h1><b><br/></b></h1>
<h1><b>The Impact</b></h1>
<p></p>
<p>While our energy supply is in turmoil, more
than 1100 TeraWatt hours of energy is stored as waste molecules and transported
as wastewater.</p>
<p>The lack of clean water is a crisis that only
increases with population growth and development.</p>
<p>Ecosystems and public health are at risk. At
risk from mining and drilling - at risk from pollutants, poisons, and pathogens
- and we are at risk of resulting economic loss, conflicts, and higher
production costs.</p>

<p>We can provide cities the
opportunity to reduce their wastewater handling expense (as well as the
freshwater used during treatment), while creating their own renewable source of
fossil-free energy, plus valuable chemicals that can be processed into
renewable products. PLUS the carbon and renewable energy credits (RECs), odor
control, and reduction of pathogens! Is this a no-brainer yet?</p>
<p>Water is one of the most
fundamental resources of civilization, enabling trillions of dollars in value
each year. When combined with reliable electricity and basic raw materials, one
can accomplish almost anything. With your support we can help heavy polluters
and developed economies deal with waste water and provide rural communities the
opportunity to gain value from their waste. This technology can be used to help
developing countries steer economic development away from harmful activities
like poaching endangered species, deforestation, or drugs, and toward more productive
ones. Together, we have the opportunity to implement a system that can
relocalize economies, provide high tech jobs, and valuable products allowing
developing and developed countries alike to continue moving toward a cleaner
future for everyone.</p>
<p>If you are seeking to reduce your carbon
footprint, help solve the world's clean water problem, or create renewable
electricity then please consider giving to this project! </p>
<p>As a company with domestic and international expertise (see our
Team section below) and a commercial scale pilot currently planned at the
Environmental Protection Agency's outpost in Cincinnati, OH, Pilus Energy can
help bring this technology around the globe by licensing our “wetware”
(intellectual property/synthetic biology expertise) and selling our consumable
“hardware” (Genetic Rights Management keys). These GeRM keys provide critical
security for the BactoBots by preventing them from being stolen or escaping
into the environment.</p>
<p><b>Genetic Rights Management (GeRM) keys are trade secret, inert,
non-toxic molecules that are added to the feedstock before it comes in contact
with the Bots. If the keys are not present in the feedstock the BactoBots will
self-destruct starting with their DNA and RNA.</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h1>If you need a little
inspiration in your life</h1>
<p>By now you may have noticed that empowerment of local economies
is one of the themes of this technology. While we seek to transform the world
with our technology, we also want to inspire and enable people to believe they
can save the world themselves. Some people just need the right tools and the
opportunity to take their fate into their own hands. <i>Those</i> are the people we
are counting on to change the world with this technology.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Every project has potential obstacles such as production delays
and collaborator mishaps. The important thing is to recognize obstacles,
address them, and overcome them. If we reach our Indiegogo goals, nothing is
going to stop us from accomplishing the objective of this project: scaling up
our BactoBot technology.</p>
<p>However, we are worried some people might be apprehensive to
support a project whose end goal is just a slightly larger version of the
product, but scaling up incrementally is an inevitable and crucial part of the
development process before building an industrial scale prototype. Our hope is
that with another successful proof-of-concept it will be easier to get
traditional funding.</p>
<p>Another challenge is government regulation, which is always a
bit of a wild card. There will be safety testing and certifications we must
obtain to keep moving forward, and bureaucracy might slow us down. One of the
issues here is the fact that the wild-type bacteria (before modification) is
“bio-safety level 2”. Despite the fact that we took the teeth away from the
junkyard dog (engineered out some of the virulence) we still have to follow
these protocols, but we are fully aware of the rules and ready to comply.</p>
<p>All that being said, we at Pilus Energy are fully confident we
can overcome these challenges and bring the world an exciting new technology to
solve a pressing issue!</p>

<h3>""Boring"" Stuff, unless you're into this kinda thing :)</h3>
<p>Pilus
Energy, LLC was founded in January, 2009 in Cincinnati, OH. It is developing
economically sustainable alternative clean technology (cleantech) energy solutions.
Its parent company, Bacterial Robotics provides the BactoBot™ synthetic biology
technology, which is based upon bacterial metabolism that cleans wastewater
while producing electricity, important gases, and chemicals. At the cellular
scale it does this 17x more efficiently than fermentation. Pilus Energy's
business model is to license to water solution experts a low-cost, scalable
electrogenic bioreactor (EBR) platform, and then provide the genetics rights
management (GeRM™) keys as consumables to the EBR platform. To date, Bacterial
Robotics has spent approximately $800k developing the Pilus Energy technology.
This money produced a powerful synthetic bacteria we call <i>P.a galvanii, </i>about a dozen lab-scale prototype
EBRs, a patent in continuation with divisionals in the US, and patents filed in
Hong Kong, China, India, and the European Union. We now need approximately $1
million and 18 months to bring this to the industrial wastewater market.</p>

V 4.0 Prototype EBR
What We Need & What You Get
Our initial goal is $50,000. If we can raise that amount, we can hire a
mechanical engineer and design then build our new bench-level prototype
complete with sensors and wi-fi data transfer. This is a critical step in
building a full size industrial prototype, and will yield important data

Stretch goal #1: If we can raise $75,000, we will be able to
begin running wastewater through the EBR and begin to get more data
on operating conditions (temperature, pH, etc.), performance properties
(remediation, electricity, biogas production, etc.), and remediation properties
(BOD, COD, hydrogen sulfide, etc.)
Stretch goal #2: If we can somehow raise $150,000, we'll build a 100
gallon reactor and we'll do our absolute best to make sure it is outfitted not
only with wifi but also with what I like to call the Star Trek package;
graphene sheets and carbon nanotubes for maximum surface area.
If we can do that we'll be well on our way to completing the
pre-pilot phase and well prepared to build a 30,000 gallon industrial scale
prototype at the Metropolitan Sewer District of Cincinnati's wastewater
treatment plant.

If we don't meet our goal we will still begin
the process, and simply go as far as the money takes us. The first step is
hiring a mechanical engineer to create the CAD (computer-aided design) drawings
of the new reactor (should cost less than $10k). Next we have the sensors +
wifi installed (this will cost ~$20k). Next the software development must take
place (another $20k). The materials and assembly for the reactor itself will
actually be less than $500 (graphene and nanotubes will make the next one
slightly more expensive). 


The Impact

While our energy supply is in turmoil, more
than 1100 TeraWatt hours of energy is stored as waste molecules and transported
as wastewater.
The lack of clean water is a crisis that only
increases with population growth and development.
Ecosystems and public health are at risk. At
risk from mining and drilling - at risk from pollutants, poisons, and pathogens
- and we are at risk of resulting economic loss, conflicts, and higher
production costs.

We can provide cities the
opportunity to reduce their wastewater handling expense (as well as the
freshwater used during treatment), while creating their own renewable source of
fossil-free energy, plus valuable chemicals that can be processed into
renewable products. PLUS the carbon and renewable energy credits (RECs), odor
control, and reduction of pathogens! Is this a no-brainer yet?
Water is one of the most
fundamental resources of civilization, enabling trillions of dollars in value
each year. When combined with reliable electricity and basic raw materials, one
can accomplish almost anything. With your support we can help heavy polluters
and developed economies deal with waste water and provide rural communities the
opportunity to gain value from their waste. This technology can be used to help
developing countries steer economic development away from harmful activities
like poaching endangered species, deforestation, or drugs, and toward more productive
ones. Together, we have the opportunity to implement a system that can
relocalize economies, provide high tech jobs, and valuable products allowing
developing and developed countries alike to continue moving toward a cleaner
future for everyone.
If you are seeking to reduce your carbon
footprint, help solve the world's clean water problem, or create renewable
electricity then please consider giving to this project! 
As a company with domestic and international expertise (see our
Team section below) and a commercial scale pilot currently planned at the
Environmental Protection Agency's outpost in Cincinnati, OH, Pilus Energy can
help bring this technology around the globe by licensing our “wetware”
(intellectual property/synthetic biology expertise) and selling our consumable
“hardware” (Genetic Rights Management keys). These GeRM keys provide critical
security for the BactoBots by preventing them from being stolen or escaping
into the environment.
Genetic Rights Management (GeRM) keys are trade secret, inert,
non-toxic molecules that are added to the feedstock before it comes in contact
with the Bots. If the keys are not present in the feedstock the BactoBots will
self-destruct starting with their DNA and RNA.

If you need a little
inspiration in your life
By now you may have noticed that empowerment of local economies
is one of the themes of this technology. While we seek to transform the world
with our technology, we also want to inspire and enable people to believe they
can save the world themselves. Some people just need the right tools and the
opportunity to take their fate into their own hands. Those are the people we
are counting on to change the world with this technology. People like the women in this video. Or the children in this one.
If you're still not inspired to join in on this crazy vision for a world powered by poop maybe Justin Hall-Tipping, Charlie Chaplin,
or Fahad Al-Attiya can
light a fire for you.

Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can’t contribute monetarily you
can still help!

We ask that you help get the word out and
make some noise about the campaign! This noise is what determines if we get featured on the
front page of Indiegogo, which is a huge benefit.
If this project interests you but you can't contribute for
whatever reason please share it with your friends! Indiegogo to make it easy
with the share tools right below the video, or this custom share page we made makes it easy as well.
And of course, nothing beats
good old fashioned word of mouth advertising!
If you want to know
more...
Whether you are a potential investor wanting to engage in due
diligence or a scientist interested in helping to improve the technology we'd
be happy to discuss providing more info such as documents explaining the
business plan and model, pro forma financials, whitepapers explaining the
science, etc. Please feel free to contact me by leaving a comment on this page
or sending a message to info@pilusenergy.com
You can also learn more about how the technology works (and
see some pictures of past prototypes), or check out our Facebook            Twitter            YouTube channel      Press Releases, and Blog to see what we've been up to. 
Risks and challenges
Every project has potential obstacles such as production delays
and collaborator mishaps. The important thing is to recognize obstacles,
address them, and overcome them. If we reach our Indiegogo goals, nothing is
going to stop us from accomplishing the objective of this project: scaling up
our BactoBot technology.
However, we are worried some people might be apprehensive to
support a project whose end goal is just a slightly larger version of the
product, but scaling up incrementally is an inevitable and crucial part of the
development process before building an industrial scale prototype. Our hope is
that with another successful proof-of-concept it will be easier to get
traditional funding.
Another challenge is government regulation, which is always a
bit of a wild card. There will be safety testing and certifications we must
obtain to keep moving forward, and bureaucracy might slow us down. One of the
issues here is the fact that the wild-type bacteria (before modification) is
“bio-safety level 2”. Despite the fact that we took the teeth away from the
junkyard dog (engineered out some of the virulence) we still have to follow
these protocols, but we are fully aware of the rules and ready to comply.
All that being said, we at Pilus Energy are fully confident we
can overcome these challenges and bring the world an exciting new technology to
solve a pressing issue!





""Boring"" Stuff, unless you're into this kinda thing :)
Pilus
Energy, LLC was founded in January, 2009 in Cincinnati, OH. It is developing
economically sustainable alternative clean technology (cleantech) energy solutions.
Its parent company, Bacterial Robotics provides the BactoBot™ synthetic biology
technology, which is based upon bacterial metabolism that cleans wastewater
while producing electricity, important gases, and chemicals. At the cellular
scale it does this 17x more efficiently than fermentation. Pilus Energy's
business model is to license to water solution experts a low-cost, scalable
electrogenic bioreactor (EBR) platform, and then provide the genetics rights
management (GeRM™) keys as consumables to the EBR platform. To date, Bacterial
Robotics has spent approximately $800k developing the Pilus Energy technology.
This money produced a powerful synthetic bacteria we call P.a galvanii, about a dozen lab-scale prototype
EBRs, a patent in continuation with divisionals in the US, and patents filed in
Hong Kong, China, India, and the European Union. We now need approximately $1
million and 18 months to bring this to the industrial wastewater market.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

Tree Shepherd CEO Colin Crooks is the pioneering social entrepreneur in residence for Lambeth Council and has 20 years experience in developing social enterprise. He is driven to relieve poverty by encouraging positive enterprising activity within the estates of Lambeth and more recently Southwark.
Tree Shepherd trains, nurtures and supports people from challenging backgrounds to get enterprising, however the main issue for many remains the cost of getting going. The Forest Foundation is key for providing much-needed grants for people who would otherwise struggle and might even give up.
He is a keen cyclist and on 30th April will be cycling in WHOOSH - a 
cycle run from Swansea to Fishguard to Skegness - a gruelling 6 day bike
 ride covering 470 miles with 36,800 ascent and wants to raise £5K to support the Forest 
Foundation.
The goal of £5K means that 10 - 15 individuals can be supported to start their businesses and pay for such things as a sewing machine, a microwave, a cash card reader, ladder & tools, a market stall, a website or business cards.
What We Need & What You Get

 Break it down for folks in more detail:  The money raised will go to a package of start-up grants that 10 - 15 people will benefit from. 50% will be specifically to support 18-30 year-olds.  Donors are invited to attend celebratory launches and network events and to see the start-up business in action.
Donors will be recognised and acknowledged as supporters of the Forest Foundation
 Our goal is to raise £5K
