Every bird sings with her own voice.And every nation has its own voice and song for which it is known. 
Dear friends,I'm Vesna Milović, a solfeggio professor from Belgrade, Serbia. Since 2006. I have been searching various resources of musical folk heritage in Serbia. I have discovered and documented 1.004 songs: musical scores with chords and lyrics, from the oldest records of song's lyrics to lyrics used in our time, legends about the origin of certain songs, names of some of the songs, and collected other very interesting facts.
These are the songs that are sung everywhere, in Belgrade's famous Skadarlija, at Serbian celebrations, on radio and television stations, old and new folk songs originating from various regions and countries where Serbian people live, town songs, romances and well known folk songs of Hungarian, Romanian and Russian origin.
What makes this book different from others is the authorization of songs and history of the origins and development of Serbian folk and town music from ancient Slavs to present time, the arrival of romance music, with the history of radio singing from 1935. till 1975.The book has three volumes and over 1.500 pages. The first volume is textual and other two contain musical scores. Book reviews were written by Prof. Dr. Dimitrije O. Golemović, the head of the Ethnomusicology Department at the Academy of Music in Belgrade, and Radoslav-Rade Vučković, composer and writer.More informations about the book can be found on the official site:Folk Music Heritage in SerbiaMY GOALMy main goal with this book is to help preserve Serbian musical tradition, remind us of the authors of beautiful songs who are forgotten and to present a brief history of the origin and development of folk and town music which is not well known to the wider public.You Tube - Folk Music Heritage in Serbia

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>A handwritten book. Not just hand-copied from a draft, but an original, handwritten manuscript, addressed specifically to one person. Like a cross between a journal and a letter, with elements of a <i>roman à clef  </i>thrown in. A personal story from the life of a poet in Paris, told directly to you, for your eyes only. This is a book that you alone will have sole possession of. </p>
<p>I've always been fascinated by the idea of personalized writing, which I've explored in my essay collections by writing in response to suggested titles. This is another step in that process. Tailoring not just the ideas, or the content, but the entire book to one specific individual.</p>
<p>I wrote the first one recently, and presented it as a gift. The sensation of handing over 200 pages of un-copied longhand writing to another person was overwhelmingly powerful. It felt more significant than any presentation of a book ever had before. But it took a great deal of time and work to make it happen. And I won't be able to fulfill my dream of making a whole series of these books unless I have a little help freeing up that time.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>First and only handwritten drafts of uncensored, unedited writing. </p>
<p>An intimate look into my world, my life, my thoughts. </p>
<p>The rights to keep, copy, distribute (or not), and otherwise control the content of this writing going forward, with the sole provision that it doesn't appear as someone else's work. Which means that you'll have a totally unique thing to show your friends, and nobody else will have that same thing. And also, if I ever get really famous somehow, you'll wind up with a valuable object on  your hands. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>Ideally, I would like to devote at least the next six months of my life to this project. Even if I don't have all that time devoted to commissions or pre-orders, I would still love to be handwriting books for people, and some of the people I would love to write one for could never afford to buy one. But during the time I'm working on this project, I'll need to pay my basic expenses (food, rent, etc) so that I can give it my full attention. And I'll also need to buy a lot of journals and pens along the way. But if you look at the amount I'm reaching for, and you spread it out over those months, you'll see that I'm not even trying to achieve minimum wage. I just hoping to (barely) survive while I do this work that I feel passionately about. In return, I'm striving to offer a special and unique experience to the reader.</p>
<p>The funding goal is flexible, because I will be devoting all the time I can to this project no matter what. But if I meet and exceed this goal, it will enable me to focus exclusively on this idea, and therefore to write more books for more people (including you!) during this time. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>Q: Is your handwriting legible?</strong>      </p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Yes. I don't even write in cursive.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will the content be interesting to me, even if I don't know you very well?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I promise to include lots of juicy, intimate details. And besides, it's already the life and thoughts of an outsider poet living in the tiny rooms of Paris. Classic stuff, no?</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I order a book, or piece of writing, for someone other than myself?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Sure! Just send me a message, when claiming your perk, to let me know who you'd like it addressed to!</p>
<p><strong>Q: If I pick a one-day perk, like a letter, postcard, or day from your life, can I choose a specific day or special occasion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Sure, why not? As long as it's possible. For the day together, we'd have to make sure we're in the same country, for example. If you have any kind of special request, just let me know and I'll try to work it out with you!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will this writing ever be published?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The recipient of each book will have sole control over that decision. If you buy a piece of writing, you will own the only copy and all the rights to decide whether it is ever typed, shared, published, etc, provided that the writing in question isn't presented as someone else's work. As you will possess the only copy, it can never be printed, performed, or distributed (by me or anyone else) except by your request and permission.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What if I don't like what you write?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're not already familiar with my writing, then hopefully you're interested in this project because you're either curious about my lifestyle, or interested in the uniqueness of the object itself. In either of these cases, there will certainly be something in there for you. And if after all that, you're still not happy with the book, you might be able to sell it to someone else ;). </p>
<p><strong>Q: If I own the rights, can I publish your writing under my own name?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No, that's the one thing you can't do. You can print it, display it, copy it, share it, publish it, authorize its use by others (with my authorship attached), and even sell it for a profit and keep the money. The one thing you can't do is pass it off as someone else's writing. My name gets to follow it around. But look at the bright side... I also get all the blame :). </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk is probably that I will go through waves of more and less interesting thoughts, and thus more and less interesting writing during the time that I'm working on these books. That's hard to avoid. But those who know me, and know my previous work, know that I always do whatever I can to push myself into the corners of my thoughts and dig for something deeper than surface observation. Whatever I'm going through, I trust that I will find a way to share it with you candidly and richly. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't able to contribute, or order a book of your own, that's fine. Many of my favorite people are in that situation!  But if you think the project is interesting, please consider sharing this page with someone else who might contribute.</p>
<p>And if you don't want to spam your friends with a crowdfunder (which I also totally understand), you could still help out by supporting my social media pages. Perhaps you could like my author page<strong> </strong>on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/authorjasonstoneking"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook</a>? Follow me on <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/jstoneking"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">twitter</a>?

Or maybe even rate one of my books on <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/jasonstoneking"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">goodreads</a>? You'd be amazed at how much those little things help. And more than anything, they lift my spirits when I'm nervous about a new project.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read through all this, and for any encouragement you can offer. It's always a risk presenting new creative ideas for public consideration, and I hope that this idea has been worth your time to consider. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions or suggestions! </p>

They dream of being normal everyday people like the rest of the world.  They dream of achieving in life.  The problem?  Usually, they don't know how to reach those goals without the distactions.   How to navigate all the drama that life can bring. </p>
<p>Well, I believe that sometimes all young people need is someone to talk to.  Someone to listen and be real with them about the world.  I’ve tried to do that my entire career.  I found that being that sounding board works wonders.  Does it solve all the problems? No, but what does?  What I do is help teens and young adults realize that there are alternatives to their issues that won’t land them in trouble or bad situations. </p>
<p>So, I wrote this book called Dream Haters.   It’s simple, I discuss the most common haters (problems) that are encountered by young adults and offer them realistic, practical ways to deal with the issue.  I also sprinkle in words of wisdom from others who have overcome obstacles and challenges in life to become successful.</p>
<p>I need your support because I desire to share this book with as many young people as possible.  I have decided to self-publish this book and it requires funding to start.   Your assistance will help me reach thousands of young people I would never otherwise have access to.  Your assistance can help make the difference in the life of a young adult reaching their dreams.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need and What You’ll Get</strong></p>
<p>I will probably need about $4500 to publish Dream Haters.  I’m asking for a smaller amount ($3500) to be humble and realistic in my beginnings.   Any amount used will go towards the publishing and distribution fees.  If I exceed my goal, I will use that funding to print additional books and offer them pro-bono to youth programs, schools, and clubs that can’t afford to purchase the books for their kids.  (I do cool workshops with young adults and the adults who work with them, so I can offer this as another way of reaching more kids!)</p>
<p>The publishing company gave me an estimate to begin with.   My set up fees including book layout, cover, technical and digital set up total $2500.00.  That doesn’t even include editing or any printing of books.   So, as you can see, $3500.00 is a conservative request.   Remember Indiegogo has to get their fee as well!   Every cent received will go into this book, so even if I don’t reach my goal, it will help me to get closer to getting this book out to deserving young people. (Just may take a little longer.)</p>
<p>If, or should I say, WHEN I reach my goal, I have a few perks for my supporters.   For a donation of $10, I will send you a personal thank you note.  For a donation of $25, I will give you a personal thank you note as well as a shout on my Twitter Feed @terarreid.   For a donation of $50, I will give you all the perks for $10 and $25 donations, plus an autographed copy of Dream Haters.   For a donation of $75, you will get all the perks of the $10 and $25 donations, plus a personal acknowledgement in Dream Haters for your support.   For a donation of $100, you will get all the prior perks, plus an invite to my Dream Haters book launch party (TBA-travel at your own expense.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact   </strong></p>
<p>I could spend a lot of time giving you statistics, but the reality is that you see the result of a lack of guidance among young people every day.  You see the news feeds and hear the stories of young adults dropping out of school, struggling with substance use, involvement in criminal activities, and mimicking what they think they should be.   The list can go on, but I’m not here to depress anyone.  I try my hardest to help uplift others.  The way I do that is through inspiration, wisdom, and sound advice.  Why choose me?  Not to brag, but I’m good at what I do.  Not for any accolades, but because I care about young people having great futures.  I haven’t “saved” every child I worked with, but I do like to think I impacted quite a few positively.   Most recently, two young ladies I mentor have gone on to earn their high school diplomas after being previously kicked out of school.  Now, I will never take credit for their hard work, but I do like to think that my motivation helped some.  I hope that you will agree with me and help me to spread my love to some more deserving young people with wonderful futures ahead of them. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to or are not able to contribute financially, you can still help!  Share my link through social media, your friends, and your family.   Find someone who believes in helping kids and is willing to contribute. Every little bit helps and I would be most grateful for any support you can offer!!  </p></div>","Summary

<p><strong> </strong>The video will give you a small idea of what the Dark Saga series is about.</p>
<p> <strong>Who Am I?</strong></p>
<p> My name is David Andrew Crawford and I am the author of Dark Solus An Assassin’s Tale, a novel I wrote and published in November 24, 2011.  This is the first book in the Dark Saga Series, and the second book and reason why I am here is Demon’s Revenge.  I dreamed of being an author and bringing to life all the crazy things my mind could come up with.  So, a few years ago I (lost my mind) decided to leave my fulltime job and began writing the story of Dark Solus in my little mobile trailer that had an indoor waterfall (the waterfall being a huge hole in my roof). I self published and it was then that I realized publishing a book costs money, a lot of money and most of it needed to go into advertisement.  So now you know the reason why I am here.</p>
<p> A little bit more about me is that I live in a little place called Innesville in Canada with my two dogs Ares, the friendly giant and Ariel, the little princess, both three year old Rottweilers.  I am an entrepreneur and an environmentalist. I am a hard worker &amp; for the next several months, writing this novel is my job. </p>
<p> <strong>About The Novel</strong></p>
<p>First let me say that my first novel Dark Solus An Assassin’s Tale has won 2 awards both in the Fantasy genre and both in contests held in the United States.  In February 2012 I won 2nd place in the Written Art Awards and in August 2012 I won Bronze in the Readers Favorite. </p>
<p>In order to understand my second novel, may I give you a brief history of Book 1.  Dark Solus, An Assassin's Tale, the first book in the Dark Saga, is a dark, fantasy novel about one of the deadliest assassins on the planet Eorth. The evil wizard Kalifen, along with the ruthless leaders of the Assassins, Thieves and Halflings guilds, murdered Dark Solus' parents when he was only a child. Haunted by their merciless execution, he now waits and prepares to exact his revenge on all those responsible for their demise. Dark is transformed and trained by the Styg, the warden of the Stygian depths, and his grandfather Mephistopheles, an ancient silver dragon. Twelve years later, Dark is now ready to travel to the City of Duergar, the home of his enemies. Trained in the skills of assassination, and armed with lethal magic devices and knowledge of the dark arts, he has set himself only one mission.....to kill them all!</p>
<p>Now with the first leg of his quest over, the second book in the Dark Saga Series, Demon’s Revenge finds him in the city of Duergar as he begins to set his plan for vengeance in motion.  Aided by the powerful artefact, the Eye of Dagda, he enters the city under the guise of Giachomo, the Jester, and sets out to destroy the Halflings’ Guild and its leader Sneak Longfoot, the Grand Master of the Guild.</p>
<p>Darkness will fall upon the kingdom of Duergar as one lone assassin rises up against the sinister forces who have gone, as of yet, unpunished.  On his quest for vengeance, Dark must face his first of many terrifying tasks that poses as much risk to himself as it does to his target.  Any doubts he may have he will bury with the dead as he puts into play a plan that will have him hunt down and kill his numerous enemies, with his shadowy blade dripping with the blood of the vanquished.</p>
<p>Dark, using all his skill as an assassin and his powerful arsenal of magical items, causes murder and mayhem throughout the fortified City of the Dwarves.  One by one the leaders of the Guilds and their followers must pay for the injustice carried out on his parents.  Then and only then will Dark have peace in the knowledge that his parents have been avenged. </p>

<p><strong><em style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go. (Dr. Seuss)</em></strong></p>
<h3>WHO</h3>
<p>You &amp; Me. We can do this! Yours truly, of course, is the mastermind with the remixes and rhymes. I'm a former English major who is utterly fascinated with the written word. By profession, I am a marcomm strategist and event planner. As the daughter of educators, I have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and learning. Whether finger tapping a keyboard or putting pen to paper, I'll make the words in my mind sing a song on the page. However, this project requires a team effort which means Y-O-U. Since I am not yet the millionaire I aspire to be and Oprah's not currently in my rolodex, I am creatively financing this project. With our combined efforts, a colorful children's book series will spring to life.</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">WHAT</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Quriouser &amp; Quriouser (ode to Alice in Wonderland) will be a boutique publishing imprint to produce, the too many to name, idea buds sprouting in my brain. Rhyme &amp; Reason, a children's book series, is the first bud to blossom in my garden. </span><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">It's an idea whose time has come after percolating in the egg that is my head for a wee bit now. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">It all started with a classic family roadtrip. You know, a few hours and some change cruising your local interstate. It's amazing the random things you chat about when you're on lockdown in a car and you have a captive audience. </span><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">On this day, the topic of nursery rhymes was our food for thought. We quickly realized that most, if not all, nursery rhymes had found a clever, rhythmic way to tell some not-so-nice stories (i.e. an irreparably cracked egg, a baby cradle crashing to the ground, three blind mice, etc.) Really? Upon further research, I learned most rhymes were coded messages of unpleasant historical events. Even the best of them often referenced things we've no clue about in the modern era. Without cheating, what are curds &amp; whey? And what about a tuffet?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">After much poking and prodding, nagging and nudging by family and friends, I finally gave in and accepted the challenge of remixing the rhymes and riddles of our childhood. Since most children have grown up with the classics while developing into fairly well-adjusted adults, my goal is to not replace the seemingly harmless, oldie but goodies. Rather, it is my goal to update the classics with a contemporary flair and positive messages. I simply wish to create another option for the nursery, nursery school or pre-school shelf. </span><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Hence, I give you Rhyme &amp; Reason!</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">WHEN</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Our campaign launches now in honor of NEA's National Read Across America Day (3/1) and Dr. Seuss's birthday (3/2). For the next 30 days, we will appeal to friends and family, neighbors and strangers, moms and dads, aunties and uncles, sisters and brothers, nanas and papas, who believe that reading sows the seeds of knowledge in the youngest of us. Nursery rhymes and fairy tales are often a toddler or preschooler's first story-telling experience. So without further ado, now is the time, and time is of the essence!</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">WHERE</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">For now, the best place to find us is right here on our Indiegogo page (until we have a web page, a web site may take a bit longer). At least once a week, and more often if the spirit moves us, we'll post power nuggets (a.k.a. updates about our project) and maybe even a resourceful link or two. We're also plotting and planning a strategy to take our project to the streets so keep your eyes open and ears peeled. Like Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, you can never know where we'll appear...rabbit holes or tea parties anyone?!</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">WHY</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">I believe that ""Reading is Fundamental"" as a way of life (and not just the nation's largest nonprofit children's literacy organization - see <a href=""http://www.rif.org).%C2%A0As"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rif.org). As</a> a child, my parents gave me my very own first book collection a.k.a. the Little Golden Books, including the Poky Little Puppy and the Little Engine That Could. I read the Mini-Pages every weekend after kidnapping them from the grown-ups' newspaper. As soon as I could read, I had my first magazine subscription, Ebony Jr. (unfortunately, no longer in publication). Then I moved on to Trixie Belden and Nancy Drew, and I have had a love of reading every since. To this very day, Curious George and the Berenstein Bears are two of my all-time favs. So the WHY is simple, I want to plant the seeds of knowledge and nurture the love of books at the earliest possible age and first opportunity!</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">HOW</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Welcome to the wonderful world of self-publishing, crowdfunding and the platform that is Indiegogo. This is where my vision, your funding and our combined actions can make a dream a reality. With your support Quriouser &amp; Quriouser's first brain bud, Rhyme and Reason, will blossom into a children book series for savvy moms and pops with little bitty kiddies and tots. Every morsel of every contribution will get this ball rolling!</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Writing &amp; Editing</strong></em></p>
<p>I am happy to write, but I'll need to contract the services of an editor. Think, ""<em>He who represents himself in court has</em><span> an idiot for a lawyer and a </span><em>fool for a client.""</em> In this same spirit, even the best writer should be wise and humble enough not edit their own manuscripts. Plus, after a few drafts, the ink cartridges and reams of paper start to add up so office supplies are on the wish list.</p>
<p><em><strong>Illustration &amp; Design</strong></em></p>
<p>While I love tinkering both freehand and digitally, I am the definition of an amateur artist. However, I am also a perfectionist so now is not the time to put my skills to the test. With that in mind, I will be hiring a professional illustrator/designer to custom create images for each one of my new and improved rhymes. Not sure if the budget will accommodate, but I would love to incorporate pop-up pictures.</p>
<p><em><strong>Printing &amp; Binding</strong></em></p>
<p>All books in the series will be available as both as an e-book as well as a traditional hard cover book (and eventually, audio, too). Everyone loves a great story read aloud at school or at bedtime. Digital media is great for a lot of things, but nothing compares to colorful illustrations, the turn of a crisp page or the voice of a dramatic storyteller. To this end, funding will also cover costs associated with production, binding and distribution of the hard covers as well as ISBN registrations and filing copyright protections.</p>
<p><em><strong>Marketing &amp; Communications</strong></em></p>
<p>It goes without saying that a portion of funds raised will be invested to a dedicated website (and possibly an app for that) and grassroots marketing campaign.  A major component of the website will be the ability to purchase and downloand PDF versions of the books with color illustrations. In addition, I aspire to a mini book tour (as in gas in the tank for me to drive to schools and bookstores brave and kind enough to let me spread my literary sunshine). </p>
<p><em><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></em></p>
<p>Although we are ambitious and confident we'll reach or exceed our funding goal, rest assured that we are also resourceful. Should the money tree not shake as freely as we'd like, whatever funding we are fortunate enough to receive will still be whole-heartedly applied to moving this project forward. There are no IFs involved here, it's only a matter of WHEN and, of course, we are hoping for sooner rather than later so we can ""be the change we wish to see in this world."" Shout-out to Gandhi!</p>
<h3><strong>GIVE ONE, GROW ONE</strong></h3>
<p>Earlier, I was talking about brain buds, sprouts and blossoms for good rhymes and even better reasons. Forget bookworms, we prefer lady bugs. Qurioser &amp; Quriosier is on a mission to spread the bug for reading because we think the power of knowledge is contagious. With your help, we can plant new buds, grow new sprouts and blossom new readers. Once we are out the gate, up and running, we will be joining the buy one, give one movement (<a href=""http://www.b1g1.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.b1g1.com</a>). Once we're turning profit, we plan to gift a book for every book sold. We can't think of a better way to pay it forward!</p>
<p><strong>FINAL THOUGHTS</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Contributions, big and small, are equally appreciated! If you don't have a leaf to spare from your money tree, you can still help us leap forward by spreading the word, posting the link, visiting us on the web, or anything else that comes to mind. You really can make a difference in more ways than one!</span></p>
<p><em><strong><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! (Dr. Seuss)</span></strong></em></p>

Quriouser & Quriouser (ode to Alice in Wonderland) will be a boutique publishing imprint to produce, the too many to name, idea buds sprouting in my brain. Rhyme & Reason, a children's book series, is the first bud to blossom in my garden. It's an idea whose time has come after percolating in the egg that is my head for a wee bit now. 
It all started with a classic family roadtrip. You know, a few hours and some change cruising your local interstate. It's amazing the random things you chat about when you're on lockdown in a car and you have a captive audience. On this day, the topic of nursery rhymes was our food for thought. We quickly realized that most, if not all, nursery rhymes had found a clever, rhythmic way to tell some not-so-nice stories (i.e. an irreparably cracked egg, a baby cradle crashing to the ground, three blind mice, etc.) Really? Upon further research, I learned most rhymes were coded messages of unpleasant historical events. Even the best of them often referenced things we've no clue about in the modern era. Without cheating, what are curds & whey? And what about a tuffet?
After much poking and prodding, nagging and nudging by family and friends, I finally gave in and accepted the challenge of remixing the rhymes and riddles of our childhood. Since most children have grown up with the classics while developing into fairly well-adjusted adults, my goal is to not replace the seemingly harmless, oldie but goodies. Rather, it is my goal to update the classics with a contemporary flair and positive messages. I simply wish to create another option for the nursery, nursery school or pre-school shelf. Hence, I give you Rhyme & Reason!
WHEN
Our campaign launches now in honor of NEA's National Read Across America Day (3/1) and Dr. Seuss's birthday (3/2). For the next 30 days, we will appeal to friends and family, neighbors and strangers, moms and dads, aunties and uncles, sisters and brothers, nanas and papas, who believe that reading sows the seeds of knowledge in the youngest of us. Nursery rhymes and fairy tales are often a toddler or preschooler's first story-telling experience. So without further ado, now is the time, and time is of the essence!
WHERE
For now, the best place to find us is right here on our Indiegogo page (until we have a web page, a web site may take a bit longer). At least once a week, and more often if the spirit moves us, we'll post power nuggets (a.k.a. updates about our project) and maybe even a resourceful link or two. We're also plotting and planning a strategy to take our project to the streets so keep your eyes open and ears peeled. Like Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, you can never know where we'll appear...rabbit holes or tea parties anyone?!
WHY
I believe that ""Reading is Fundamental"" as a way of life (and not just the nation's largest nonprofit children's literacy organization - see www.rif.org). As a child, my parents gave me my very own first book collection a.k.a. the Little Golden Books, including the Poky Little Puppy and the Little Engine That Could. I read the Mini-Pages every weekend after kidnapping them from the grown-ups' newspaper. As soon as I could read, I had my first magazine subscription, Ebony Jr. (unfortunately, no longer in publication). Then I moved on to Trixie Belden and Nancy Drew, and I have had a love of reading every since. To this very day, Curious George and the Berenstein Bears are two of my all-time favs. So the WHY is simple, I want to plant the seeds of knowledge and nurture the love of books at the earliest possible age and first opportunity!
HOW
Welcome to the wonderful world of self-publishing, crowdfunding and the platform that is Indiegogo. This is where my vision, your funding and our combined actions can make a dream a reality. With your support Quriouser & Quriouser's first brain bud, Rhyme and Reason, will blossom into a children book series for savvy moms and pops with little bitty kiddies and tots. Every morsel of every contribution will get this ball rolling!
Writing & Editing
I am happy to write, but I'll need to contract the services of an editor. Think, ""He who represents himself in court has an idiot for a lawyer and a fool for a client."" In this same spirit, even the best writer should be wise and humble enough not edit their own manuscripts. Plus, after a few drafts, the ink cartridges and reams of paper start to add up so office supplies are on the wish list.
Illustration & Design
While I love tinkering both freehand and digitally, I am the definition of an amateur artist. However, I am also a perfectionist so now is not the time to put my skills to the test. With that in mind, I will be hiring a professional illustrator/designer to custom create images for each one of my new and improved rhymes. Not sure if the budget will accommodate, but I would love to incorporate pop-up pictures.
Printing & Binding
All books in the series will be available as both as an e-book as well as a traditional hard cover book (and eventually, audio, too). Everyone loves a great story read aloud at school or at bedtime. Digital media is great for a lot of things, but nothing compares to colorful illustrations, the turn of a crisp page or the voice of a dramatic storyteller. To this end, funding will also cover costs associated with production, binding and distribution of the hard covers as well as ISBN registrations and filing copyright protections.
Marketing & Communications
It goes without saying that a portion of funds raised will be invested to a dedicated website (and possibly an app for that) and grassroots marketing campaign.  A major component of the website will be the ability to purchase and downloand PDF versions of the books with color illustrations. In addition, I aspire to a mini book tour (as in gas in the tank for me to drive to schools and bookstores brave and kind enough to let me spread my literary sunshine). 
Miscellaneous
Although we are ambitious and confident we'll reach or exceed our funding goal, rest assured that we are also resourceful. Should the money tree not shake as freely as we'd like, whatever funding we are fortunate enough to receive will still be whole-heartedly applied to moving this project forward. There are no IFs involved here, it's only a matter of WHEN and, of course, we are hoping for sooner rather than later so we can ""be the change we wish to see in this world."" Shout-out to Gandhi!
GIVE ONE, GROW ONE
Earlier, I was talking about brain buds, sprouts and blossoms for good rhymes and even better reasons. Forget bookworms, we prefer lady bugs. Qurioser & Quriosier is on a mission to spread the bug for reading because we think the power of knowledge is contagious. With your help, we can plant new buds, grow new sprouts and blossom new readers. Once we are out the gate, up and running, we will be joining the buy one, give one movement (www.b1g1.com). Once we're turning profit, we plan to gift a book for every book sold. We can't think of a better way to pay it forward!
FINAL THOUGHTS
Contributions, big and small, are equally appreciated! If you don't have a leaf to spare from your money tree, you can still help us leap forward by spreading the word, posting the link, visiting us on the web, or anything else that comes to mind. You really can make a difference in more ways than one!

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Meet the Author<br/>
</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Michael Alexander. I’m an author from Los Angeles,
California, and I've spent most of my adulthood chasing adventure. A former
medic in the United States Air Force and a former fire fighter for a major metropolitan
city, I've done some amazing things. Things most people can only dream about
and been in life and death situations, some too close for comfort. I’m a 32
Degree Scottish Rite Freemason and having been knighted as a Knights Templar, I’ve
delved deep into the mysteries of secret societies. Are the conspiracy theories
true...Hmm (maybe)? With a Master's Degree in Diplomacy and International
Relations, my background is rich in ancient history and mythology and all of my
experience and education have worked together to create an imaginative new story
where a secret society of thieves work to keep the world safe from immensely
powerful beings that once walked the earth.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why the Campaign<br/>
</h3>
<p>I love the art of storytelling and I write stories that I
like to read. Stories full of exciting but believable action between heroes and
villains, pitting good against evil, but most importantly, the human aspect. My
stories focus on the relationships between the characters and how living
through the trials and tribulations make or break them. <i>Thieves of Elysium</i> is a new and intriguing story where likeable characters, both good
and notorious, are so out of place it takes all they have to survive and overcome
the hardships they face.</p>
<p><b>But I can’t do it without your help</b>. I need to raise $6000
to cover the cost of publishing both novels and “Officially” release the
series. So, I’m turning to my strongest supporters to ask for contributions. <b>In
exchange</b>, I’m offering autographed copies of the novels, eBooks, and
merchandise with the <i>Thieves of Elysium</i> logo. Your contributions will help me
attain my dream of becoming a published author and more importantly you will
strengthen Indie Authors everywhere as more and more authors Self-Publish and break
away from the stranglehold of traditional publishing.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">The Thieves of Elysium</h1>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;""> Series</h1>
<p>The underground city of Elysium has remained a secret for nearly a 
thousand years buried deep beneath the Himalayan Mountains in what many 
call, ""The Inner Earth."" The secret society of thieves dating back to 
the crusades has remained to this day, an invisible influence throughout
 the world. Elysian Thieves have become the best trained operatives 
throughout history acquiring whatever artifacts need to be taken to keep
 the world safe. For within Elysium stands a portal to Mythos, the Land 
of the Gods. A refuge for the mythological heroes and gods of old that 
once walked the earth, before the Great Flood that drove them to another
 realm. Mythos is a land of beauty and temptation beyond description and
 an ancient evil stirs within its borders with Elysium in its sights.</p>
<p>The series centers around Phoenix, a courageous fire fighter who has 
yet to discover why he can touch fire and not get burned and why death 
eludes him time and again. When circumstances and family secrets are 
revealed he discovers the existence of the ancient Thieves Guild and 
must come to terms with his true heritage. His family and Elysium are in
 grave danger and he must sacrifice everything to save those he loves.
Thieves of Elysium is a modern day ""Indiana Jones,"" shrouded in 
mythology and ancient mysteries to create a series full of action and 
adventure, love and romance, sacrifice and duty.</p>

</h1>
<p>
</p>
<p>When arson is needed to
steal rare Babylonian artifacts revealing the location of an antediluvian
treasure deep within one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, Phoenix,
Los Angeles’ most courageous fire fighter, is blackmailed into doing the job.
But his unique gift of standing in fire and not getting burned wasn’t the only
reason he was chosen. Not only does he discover an age-old secret society of
thieves dedicated to, “keeping the world safe,” but his ties to the ancient
Thieves Guild are much closer than he knows. The kidnapping of his daughter
forces his wife to reveal her deepest kept secret as they traverse the globe with
the aid of less than savory black-market scoundrels and infiltrate the
underground city of Elysium, the thief guild’s sacred paradise. His daughter
used as bait, Phoenix is lured deeper down the rabbit hole where he discovers
his family’s true heritage, and the reason why he cheats death again and again.
But the magical city is on the verge of collapse as an ancient evil seeks to reclaim
the power and riches that Elysium holds. Phoenix’s only concern is saving his
family and returning to their charmed life but uncontrollable events in Elysium
forces him to confront his families hidden past where reality and mythology are
often one and the same.</p>
<p><i>Risen from Ashes</i> is the first book in the <i>Thieves of Elysium</i> series where a seemingly ordinary man must take
the hero’s journey far beyond the realm of reality into a land where heroes,
gods, and riches untold abound.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3 align=""center"">
<i>Excerpt from ""Risen from Ashes""</i>
</h3>
<p>Tacitus stood next him and looked at the crowd below. ""The people of Elysium need a hero.""</p>
<p>""I didn't come here to be their savior."" Phoenix glared at him. ""I came to rescue my family.""</p>
<p>""The time has come when we must sacrifice everything to save what is most important.""</p>
<p>""Sacrifice?"" Phoenix growled as he walked away. ""I've lost everyone 
that I love, everything that I had is gone. I have nothing to offer.""</p>
<p>Tacitus approached him holding his head high. ""Then you must rise from the ashes.""</p>
<p>""How?"" Phoenix choked on his words. ""How do I do that?""</p>
<p>""To begin..."" Tacitus held out the ring. ""I will train you to be one of the greatest thieves the Guild has ever known.""</p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Love-Lies-Bleeding
</h1>
<p>
</p>
<p>In “Love-Lies-Bleeding,” <i>Conradin</i>,
one of Elysium’s greatest thieves is the commander of an elite unit known as
Shadow Team. He must lead a rescue mission into the fabled land of Mythos to
rescue <i>Rebecca</i>, the daughter of a
prominent Guild Council Member. The young and beautiful thief ventured into
Mythos in search of the legendary Amaranth flower. A flower of undying beauty
that never fades; the flower she wanted to give to her husband on their wedding
day.</p>
<p>Locating her captors, The Shadow Team discover she is meant
to be a sacrifice at a ceremony to unify the Satyrian tribes under <i>Therion</i>, the self-proclaimed King of the
Satyrs, and an estranged son of Hermes. But Therion’s ambitions go even
further, he’s formed an unholy alliance with the Veradunii, a magical race
forbidden in Mythos, in order to depose his father’s rule and bring Mythos and
Elysium under his dominion.</p>
<p>The Shadow Team also meets Agreus, a Satyroi Seer who
prophesies the coming heir to the <i>Blades
of Fire</i>, the one who will rise from the ashes to defend Elysium in the
coming war with Mythos. Conradin must now choose between assassinating Therion
and protecting his homeland or saving Rebecca, his fiancée.</p>
<p><i>Love-Lies-Bleeding</i>
is a story of love and sacrifice where one of Elysium’s greatest heroes must
choose between his heart and his duty to Elysium.</p>
<br/>
<h4>Why the prequel?</h4>
<p>Although I am tirelessly working on the sequel to <i>Risen from Ashes</i>, I was surprised how many people wanted to know more about Conradin, 
the scar-faced thief and his tragic back story. Since he
 plays a significant role in the rest of the series I felt it necessary to 
write a story revealing his background. <i>Love-Lies-Bleeding</i> adds depth to the series revealing more about Elysium, 
Mythos, and several other characters 
that will play a major factor in subsequent novels. Instead of weighing <i>Risen from Ashes</i> down with a ton of flashbacks and side stories I choose to write a separate novel to compliment the series. I hope you enjoy it!<br/></p>

Risen from Ashes



When arson is needed to
steal rare Babylonian artifacts revealing the location of an antediluvian
treasure deep within one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, Phoenix,
Los Angeles’ most courageous fire fighter, is blackmailed into doing the job.
But his unique gift of standing in fire and not getting burned wasn’t the only
reason he was chosen. Not only does he discover an age-old secret society of
thieves dedicated to, “keeping the world safe,” but his ties to the ancient
Thieves Guild are much closer than he knows. The kidnapping of his daughter
forces his wife to reveal her deepest kept secret as they traverse the globe with
the aid of less than savory black-market scoundrels and infiltrate the
underground city of Elysium, the thief guild’s sacred paradise. His daughter
used as bait, Phoenix is lured deeper down the rabbit hole where he discovers
his family’s true heritage, and the reason why he cheats death again and again.
But the magical city is on the verge of collapse as an ancient evil seeks to reclaim
the power and riches that Elysium holds. Phoenix’s only concern is saving his
family and returning to their charmed life but uncontrollable events in Elysium
forces him to confront his families hidden past where reality and mythology are
often one and the same.
Risen from Ashes is the first book in the Thieves of Elysium series where a seemingly ordinary man must take
the hero’s journey far beyond the realm of reality into a land where heroes,
gods, and riches untold abound.



Excerpt from ""Risen from Ashes""

Tacitus stood next him and looked at the crowd below. ""The people of Elysium need a hero.""
""I didn't come here to be their savior."" Phoenix glared at him. ""I came to rescue my family.""
""The time has come when we must sacrifice everything to save what is most important.""
""Sacrifice?"" Phoenix growled as he walked away. ""I've lost everyone 
that I love, everything that I had is gone. I have nothing to offer.""
Tacitus approached him holding his head high. ""Then you must rise from the ashes.""
""How?"" Phoenix choked on his words. ""How do I do that?""
""To begin..."" Tacitus held out the ring. ""I will train you to be one of the greatest thieves the Guild has ever known.""



Love-Lies-Bleeding



In “Love-Lies-Bleeding,” Conradin,
one of Elysium’s greatest thieves is the commander of an elite unit known as
Shadow Team. He must lead a rescue mission into the fabled land of Mythos to
rescue Rebecca, the daughter of a
prominent Guild Council Member. The young and beautiful thief ventured into
Mythos in search of the legendary Amaranth flower. A flower of undying beauty
that never fades; the flower she wanted to give to her husband on their wedding
day.
Locating her captors, The Shadow Team discover she is meant
to be a sacrifice at a ceremony to unify the Satyrian tribes under Therion, the self-proclaimed King of the
Satyrs, and an estranged son of Hermes. But Therion’s ambitions go even
further, he’s formed an unholy alliance with the Veradunii, a magical race
forbidden in Mythos, in order to depose his father’s rule and bring Mythos and
Elysium under his dominion.
The Shadow Team also meets Agreus, a Satyroi Seer who
prophesies the coming heir to the Blades
of Fire, the one who will rise from the ashes to defend Elysium in the
coming war with Mythos. Conradin must now choose between assassinating Therion
and protecting his homeland or saving Rebecca, his fiancée.
Love-Lies-Bleeding
is a story of love and sacrifice where one of Elysium’s greatest heroes must
choose between his heart and his duty to Elysium.

Why the prequel?
Although I am tirelessly working on the sequel to Risen from Ashes, I was surprised how many people wanted to know more about Conradin, 
the scar-faced thief and his tragic back story. Since he
 plays a significant role in the rest of the series I felt it necessary to 
write a story revealing his background. Love-Lies-Bleeding adds depth to the series revealing more about Elysium, 
Mythos, and several other characters 
that will play a major factor in subsequent novels. Instead of weighing Risen from Ashes down with a ton of flashbacks and side stories I choose to write a separate novel to compliment the series. I hope you enjoy it!

The Goal

The goal is to get both ""Risen from Ashes,"" and ""Love-Lies-Bleeding,"" published with Amazon's CreateSpace, the world's leading Self-Publishing company. Amazon leads the world in book distribution and reaching our financial goal will allow me to work with their publishing team.
The end results will be:


""Risen from Ashes"" in physical softcover format

""Risen from Ashes"" in eBook through Amazon

""Love-Lies-Bleeding"" in physical softcover format
""Love-Lies-Bleeding"" in eBook through Amazon

Cover art for ""Love-Lies-Bleeding""

Interior design for both novels in physical and eBook format
Marketing essentials with CreateSpace to align the ""Thieves of Elysium"" series in the market place to reach its target audience and promote the series through Amazon and everywhere books are sold

Professional Editor that will oversee both manuscripts through the editorial process of Line Editing and Copyediting to ensure the finest quality and highly polished novels

""Love-Lies-Bleeding"" will go through the editing process from start to 
finish while ""Risen from Ashes,"" already published in eBook format, will
 go through a minor Line Editing and be repackaged for global 
distribution. 
NOTE: Softcover vs. Hardcover
After speaking with the Senior Publishing Consultant at Amazon's Createspace I've learned that hardcover books are not only very expensive to produce but are dropping in demand. Although I prefer the old fashion traditional hardcover format I have chosen to go with the market's demand for softcover and eBook formats. Hopefully one day soon, when the series is successful I can have hardcovers made for those that prefer them, such as myself.
In addition:
All money raised above and beyond to cover the publishing expenses will be used to create:

A professional author's website for fans to stay up-to-date with the latest news on the ""Thieves of Elysium"" series and new projects from me, the author.
Merchandise (T-shirts, Posters, bookmarks, and coffee mugs)
Marketing and Advertising

The Impact

Readers are the new Gatekeepers of today's markets...not the all 
powerful publishing houses that once dominated the literary world. The 
FANS get to decide what they want to read and in what format.
Your contributions will make the Thieves of Elysium series a reality. Only by supporting Indie Artists can new and exciting stories be told outside the realm of traditional publishing. 
As an Independent or Indie Author, we must compete with the established 
publishing houses that have controlled what the public gets to read for far too long. As an Indie Author
 we take our art directly to you the reader on our own terms. Which more
 often than not means stories that are more interesting and more unique 
then the cookie cutter predictable stories that corporate publishing 
houses churn out.
Your contributions and support will help pave the way for more Independent Authors to produce high quality work and redefine the publishing industry.

Révolution, c’est un portail
d’envergure mondiale où l’on trouve une bibliothèque d’articles de référence,
des séries vidéo éducatives et un bottin de ressources internationales 
Tout un éventail d’informations pour se soigner, se nourrir et vivre en
symbiose avec la nature, réunies en un site Internet convivial qui enseigne l’Ayurvéda, médecine traditionnelle de l’Inde.



▬▬●▬▬●▬▬●▬▬●▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬●▬▬●▬▬●▬▬●▬▬


L'Ayurvéda a été conçu à l'origine par
les anciens qui, soucieux de soutenir l'humanité dans ses migrations urbaines,
nous ont transmis comment soigner le stress engendré par ces regroupements.




Explorez dès maintenant les premiers pas d'Ayurveda Revolution !  ☞






Nous croyons en l’importance de l’autonomie pour évoluer au-delà des limites du système et faire face aux défis modernes. L'Ayurvéda renferme un potentiel énorme pour apporter des solutions à nos problèmes actuels de santé.


Plusieurs médecins et acteurs du domaine de la santé et du monde académique s'intéressent à nos enseignements et activités, tels que le Dr. Samuel Blain qui championne la médecine intégrative au Québec et l'université de Montréal qui prépare un certificat en médecine holistique.
Nous envisageons organiser un mouvement pour réunir médecine moderne et holistique et émettre des recommandations concrètes aux autorités de la santé publique du Québec.

On se présente :




Charlotte ""Coconut"" : Partisane de l'autonomie et de la liberté, je suis un jour tombée sur une femme qui a vulgarisé les ingrédients de ma crème à mains : Corinne Gouget. Ce fût la Révolution. Ma salle de bain, ma cuisine, ma vie, celle de mon chat et de tout mon entourage y ont passé : une tornade du retour aux sources et née.

L'herboristerie a toujours été pour moi la Nature qui offre ses remèdes à ses petits, mais quand j'ai découvert l'Ayurvéda, ça a pris tout son sens. Le jour où on s'est rencontrés fut le même que celui où j'ai décidé de m'y consacrer. 
Jadis, je me suis collée à plusieurs Univers différents : juridique, fiscal, artistique, langues étrangères, peinture automobile, entrepreneuriat, sciences pures, et à présent, herboristerie et Ayurvéda. 

Aujourd'hui, j'unifie ma curiosité passionnée à un mode de vie qui m'offre la liberté de suivre mes inspirations et de m'immerger dans les expérimentations quotidiennes de l'Ayurvéda et des plantes médicinales.


Jonathan ""Herbo Joe"" : J’ai découvert l’Ayurvéda en 2000 lors de mon premier séjour en Inde. Je suis tombé sévèrement malade et un médecin comprit sans mot dire mon problème, simplement à la lecture de mon pouls. Il résolut mon état rapidement grâce à quelques plantes médicinales.Désireux d’apprendre des « vrais de vrais » je suis retourné à maintes reprises dans ce pays pour étudier à la source. Je me suis lié d'amitié avec Dr. Kannan, qui s'est avéré être l'héritier d'une lignée renommée de maîtres ayurvédiques du Kérala. Il est devenu mon mentor et aujourd'hui encore je m'émerveille de ses enseignements.

Je suis herboriste-thérapeute accrédité et naturopathe, j’ai publié en 2010 un premier site Internet sur la médecine naturelle : projetenvie.com, et démarré à Montréal en 2013 un centre ayurvédique complet : Espace Ayurvéda, qui offre des formations professionnelles, des produits spécialisés, des consultations et une gamme de soins ayurvédiques.





Martin ""Cowboy"" : J'ai joins le projet en tant que directeur artistique, ce qui m'a permis d'en apprendre sur l'Ayurvéda. Je m’occupe de l’image d’Ayurvéda Révolution ainsi que de la réalisation des séries vidéo éducatives. 

Artiste visuel iconoclaste et multi-disciplinaire aux élans parfois révolutionnaires, j'ai participé à de nombreux projets de haut niveau en tant qu’artiste responsable du concept et de la réalisation graphique.


Je suis également l’auteur des Cahiers Noir, des recueils de dessins originaux à colorier et à compléter qui stimule la créativité des petits comme des grands.




Nicolas ""Nico"" : J'apporte mon expérience de vidéaste ainsi que mon expertise technique et technologique. Mon premier contact avec l’Ayurvéda survient alors que des amis du Pakistan me visitent et me transmettent certaines pratiques et connaissances relatives à cette science.

Ayant longuement pratiqué les 5 tibétains, je plonge dans le yoga pour quelques années. J'ai eu une carrière en informatique et médias, dont 7 ans à bâtir des infrastructures à Moment Factory et pour des clients privés dans les domaine du film et de la télévision.
J'ai quitté tout cela pour retrouver à nouveau ma passion pour la santé naturelle, m’immergeant dans des études en naturopathie et en Ayurvéda afin d’approfondir mes connaissances et mon expertise dans le domaine.

<p><i><b>Short Summary</b></i></p>
<p><i>Error and Loss</i> is a philosophy
of science and religion. It examines a fundamental, 
unacknowledged error in the world-view of our age, as well as the
immense loss caused by this error—a loss that deeply affects the
quality of our lives. A recognition of the error opens up a fresh way of looking at the world, one which casts the current debates regarding science, religion, and atheism in a new light, since all sides share the unexamined belief that <i>Error and Loss</i> exposes. In the light of <i>Error and Loss, </i>in fact, the debate dissolves, and is replaced by a different way of conceiving of reality. </p>
<p>I am a math and physics teacher who has studied religious ideas intensively (I have an MAR from Yale Divinity School and a BA in Chinese Literature from Yale College, and have studied source criticism at the Vatican University). 7 years ago I wrote the first draft of <i>Error and Loss</i> during a four-week retreat at the cabin in Piemonte, Italy, that is pictured on the overlay to my Indiegogo video. I am now asking the Indiegogo community to support me while I return to the cabin for a longer period of time (5 months) to bring the book into final form. <br/></p>
<p><b><i>The Book</i></b><br/></p>
<p>Certainly many people today experience, at least sporadically, a feeling of awe and wonder at our existence, our world, our
universe. Yet this awe and wonder is in most cases <i>qualified</i>
by a kind of deadness hovering always in the background—qualified in
a way that it was not for earlier peoples. This <i>deadening</i> comes
from the thought that our existence, our experience, and the <i>specific objects</i>
of our experience can be <i>explained </i>by, or are explicable <i>in
principle</i>, by the powerful reasonings of our natural sciences.
When physicists speak of a “Theory of Everything” they express
this idea in a nutshell.</p>
<p><i>Error and Loss</i> does not at all
propose erasing scientific advances or technological wonders. It does
not look to return to animistic times of ignorance, superstition, and
brutality, times it in no way attempts to idealize. It is not a New
Age work. It is written by a math and physics teacher and
its tool is transparently clear reasoning. The problem I attack in
our scientific world-view is not that it employs cold reason at the
expense of poetry, but that it does not reason <i>well or
consistently enough.</i> Specifically, it makes unexamined
assumptions which carry extremely significant but overlooked
implications. <i>Error and Loss</i> pinpoints these, following out
their consequences and driving them home. In particular, <i>Error and Loss</i> examines the implications of our belief in the <i>independent existence</i> of a world outside of our consciousness, arguing that these extend much further than is generally acknowledged, when acknowledged at all.<br/></p>
<p>Despite its pessimistic-sounding title,
<i>Error and Loss</i> is actually an optimistic book, one that
believes that we can, if we see through the fundamental error of our
age, have the best of both worlds: the triumphs of scientific understanding <i>and </i>the
magic—not the surface magic, but the magic from the depths—that
enriched the lives of earlier times in a way that we are profoundly
nostalgic for. And this is not just because we would like to have
more magic in our lives, but because, if seen clearly for once, that
magic is there.</p>
<p><b><i>The Project</i></b><br/></p>
<p>I have already written a first draft of
<i>Error and Loss</i>. I wrote it during a four-week stay in the hut mentioned above. This hut is a three-hour walk from the closest
village and a two-hour hike from the nearest road. There, 1500 meters above sea level, the main
events of the day are the rising and setting of the sun and the
convolutions of the weather. There is no electricity, and in order to
get cell phone reception I have to climb for another hour up onto a
ridge. I cook my meals with wood gathered from the forest floor. I
eat rice and lentils and oatmeal and, in the summer months, potatoes
and lettuces from a small garden. <br/></p>
<p>While I have tried to work on
revisions of <i>Error and Loss</i> in more civilized locations, these
lack the isolation, quiet, and distance from technology that allow me
to come into touch with what I am trying to do. I am now asking you,
the Indiegogo community, to fund a longer retreat into nature, back
to this hut, so that I can thoroughly revise my current draft and
return with a finished product—an accessible, practical,
easy-to-grasp philosophy that I believe can help remove a terrible
error and make good an awful loss.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to go into
the mountains on April 1st, 2015, and remain there until the end of August. (I will come down occasionally to stock up on
food and other necessities.) I will have an initial
version finished by July 1<sup>st</sup>, at which time I will return
to civilization for a week to type it up and send a pdf for review to
selected readers and to my sponsors. I will then return to the hut and put the finishing
touches on the manuscript. At the end of August <sup> </sup>I will return to
civilization, type up, pdf, and bind the final version, and then send
it to my sponsors. 
</p>
<p>A next step will be to find an agent
and a publisher for the book, but the Indiegogo-funded project ends
with the mailing of the copies by September 30. Of course I will
notify all of my Indiegogo supporters upon successful publication
of the book, and offer them signed copies. This step, however, is too
subject to the vagaries of the publishing world to set fixed dates
to, and so is not part of my concrete proposal.</p>
<p>I will be taking an unpaid leave of
absence from my job as math and physics teacher in Hasliberg, Switzerland, in order to work on
this project. I can only afford to do this if my expenses during the
months away are covered: health insurance, rent on my small studio,
food, travel, and the modest support I provide to my three children. <br/></p>
<p>$2500 per month will cover these costs,
and I am asking to be supported from April 1<sup>st</sup> till the end of August. If I can raise $12,500, this gig is on. As this is a fixed funding campaign, your contribution will be refunded to you in the event that my goal of $12,500 is not reached within 30 days. This guarantees that your money will not be used to support an only partially funded project. It's all or nothing.<br/></p>
<p><i><b>Who I am</b></i><br/></p>I was born in California and grew up in Massachusetts and in Switzerland. My senior project in high school was an extended essay on the scientific Weltanschauung. I attended Yale College where I studied first Philosophy and then, in order to read Zen and Taoist texts in the original, Chinese Language and Literature. After a year in Rome taking courses at the Pontificia Universitas Gregoriana I completed an academic degree (MAR) at Yale Divinity School, focusing primarily on Biblical Hebrew and the Hebrew Bible. I simultaneously earned my teaching certification in high school mathematics, which I later extended, after a two year study of physics and physics pedagogy at Smith College, to include physics as well. After teaching in Rome for two years I went on to teach math and physics for nineteen years at the Ecole d'Humanite in Hasliberg, Switzerland. I was appointed Director of the Ecole in 2009 and served in this post until summer, 2014. <br/><br/>I am a certified ski touring guide and licensed paragliding pilot. I have published a series of short mystery stories in <i>Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine</i>, and am currently looking for a publisher for my novel, <i>Double, Double</i>, a mystery set against the controversy over who wrote Shakespeare's plays. I have three children, Joshua, Sonia, and Caleb, aged 23, 19, and 15.<br/><br/>My interest in the philosophies of science and religion and their relationship goes back to a moment when, as a 16-year-old walking along Sparks Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, I was struck by the circular nature of any justification for the validity of reasoned argument. I remember this moment distinctly—the fountain at the fork between Brattle and Craigie Streets, the tall  trees in full leaf, the erratic traffic. It seemed that I had seen something that would have to change my life, something that was not quaint or academic but rather, if taken seriously, both shattering and freeing. As a freshman at Yale, reading Alan Watts and Carlos Casteneda in my free time, I studied Kant's <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> in my philosophy class. It took my breath away, and I wrote a paper on it called <i>The Necessity of Noumena</i>.<br/><br/>This paper  landed me in something of a fix. My professor called me to his office, high up in a faux-gothic tower overlooking the New Haven Cemetery, and quizzed me for an hour on the points raised in my paper. Finally he came out with it: I could not possibly have written this paper. This was not only his opinion but shared by the Philosophy department faculty. He wished to know from where I had plagiarized it. <br/><br/>I proclaimed my innocence, was disbelieved, and left his office with roiling emotions. On the one hand, I was ecstatic to have written a paper that ""no graduate student at Yale"" could have written. On the other hand, I was possibly in big trouble. I returned to my room and, these being the days before personal computers, realized that I had something that might save me: the yellow legal pad with the first draft of the essay and all my subsequent deletions and insertions. I brought it to him and half an hour later received a phone call apologizing for the false accusation. <br/><br/>I received the paper back in the next class with an acerbic 'A' penciled in at the end and no comment. I was never given any encouragement from the Philosophy faculty, and moved over to the Chinese department, later writing my senior thesis on the wine poetry of Tao Chien. I felt, however, and still feel, whenever I read books or articles on atheism, religion, or the philosophy of science, that the author is missing an essential point, a point hidden within an assumption so basic that it is consistently overlooked. Yet exactly this point  renders the often passionate, meticulously reasoned argument next to irrelevant. It concerns our belief (or disbelief) in the independent existence of a world external to our consciousness, and forms the crux of <i>Error and Loss</i>.<br/><br/>Between <i>The Necessity of Noumena </i>and <i>Error and Loss</i> came decades in which I devoted myself to dear and practical matters, centered largely on raising my three children, teaching, and mountain climbing. While these years were full of intense moments of reflection, I never had the consistent time or leisure necessary to put my thought into anything close to a coherent form. And when I looked for my college philosophy paper several years ago, I found it had disappeared in one of our many moves. I sought it out desperately and discovered much forgotten material, but <i>The Necessity of Noumena</i> was not among it. I felt a lack, a thing undone, and the desire to pen my thoughts in a convincing and accessible fashion grew and grew.<br/><br/>About 7 years ago I took a break and retreated for four weeks to our hut in Piemonte. There, alone with the weather, the sunrises and sunsets, and the stars, I spent my days and nights putting the first draft of <i>Error and Loss </i>to paper. I liked it, but the scrawls and crossings-out and scribbled additions now decorating the typed manuscript testify to an immense work that still must be done to render it in final form. I am now asking you, the Indiegogo community, to give me time away up in the mountains to finish my work. I am asking you to replace enough of my teaching salary to allow me to take an unpaid leave and spend five months working on my passion in the place whose silence and mystery enriches and inspires my vision.<br/><br/><b><i>Risks and Challenges</i></b><br/><p>
</p>
<p>
</p>I do not believe that there are significant risks facing this project. I have already written and reflected deeply on the first draft of <i>Error and Loss</i>, and what I want to say is clear to me. The challenge I will face is making my ideas as clear to my readers as they are to me. My pedagogical experience of over twenty years' teaching math and physics gives me a strong basis to believe that I am capable of mastering this challenge. The delight of teaching, for me, lies in figuring out the exact way to present a concept to a struggling student so that the light will go on and he or she will say, ""Aha! I get it."" I believe I have been very succesful at this over the course of my teaching career, and it is exactly this skill that is required to bring <i>Error and Loss</i> into a final, readable, ""Aha! I get it!"" form. I am eager for this challenge and have full confidence that I will meet it.<br/><br/>Meanwhile I have equal confidence in my writing ability. I have written a number of mystery stories for <i>Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine, </i>a mass-circulation monthly that reaches a wide-ranging audience. Writing a mystery is not entirely unlike writing a philosophy—the mystery in the philosophy is deeper, but one must still present it clearly, in an exciting, accessible, and suspenseful manner, and with  a teacher's awareness for where one's invisible audience will stumble or need help.<br/><br/>Another challenge might be the loneliness and simplicity of the hermit's life I will be leading while working on the book. I have much experience, however, in being alone in the mountains, a situation in which I often feel my best. I stayed up in the wilderness, mostly alone, for forty days in summer 2013, without coming down to civilization even once. I find that the experience of simplicity, weather, and daily rhythms deepens the longer I stay, and I have never come down without wishing that I could have stayed up longer!<br/><br/><b><i>Conclusion<br/><br/></i></b>I realize that I am asking an awful lot when I expect you to believe that I have a new, key insight into such huge issues, an insight so valuable that, even at this late stage in the history of philosophy, it is still worth putting out into the world. But I am convinced that it is, and this conviction has grown over the years to the point where, with a limited amount of time left me on this good earth, I am conquering my fear of appearing arrogant and doing something so uncomfortable as asking for your money. Please support me! In return, I promise you a fascinating, accessible, and mind-altering read!<br/><br/><br/>

Se han ganado la enemistad del gobierno, al punto de ser ellos y sus auspiciantes acosados por el mismo a través de operaciones de prensa y de la AFIP.Con A Las Ocho, podrás acceder a su opinión y análisis político-económico en forma diaria sin depender de favores del estado o de empresas que son constantemente condicionadas por el mismo.A Las Ocho es un programa de veinte minutos diarios de lunes a viernes, a las ocho de la noche, disponible en vivo y luego en diferido por YouTube, financiado por la audiencia.Los colaboradores, con esta campaña ayudarán así a dar el puntapié inicial para un nuevo tipo de programas de opinión política, que no dependan ni del estado, ni de hacer lobby, ni de empresas que están a merced de los gobiernos. Así, podrá disfrutarse de una opinión honesta y no afectada por intereses o dependencia económica.El objetivo de recaudación de esta campaña será de USD 6.000, lo que permitirá tener el programa al aire por tres meses ininterrumpidos. Los Ciudadanos se convertirán en productores, colaborando en la difusión de sus ideas e incitando a otros ciudadanos y periodistas a hacer lo mismo.Convertite en un Ciudadano-ProductorA Las Ocho requiere de tu colaboración para llegar a un total de USD 6.000, lo que permitirá a Benegas, Cachanosky y su equipo televisar (en vivo y en diferido) un total de 65 programas regulares (tres meses, de lunes a viernes), además de especiales cuando las circunstancias lo requieran.Lo recaudado será para cubrir los costos de emisión y producción del programa, así como también de la infraestructura y puesta online de cada episodio.En caso de no completarse el total, se emitirá una cantidad de programas proporcional a lo recaudadoColaboradores Donando USD 20 o más, estás realmente comprometido con el éxito del programa. Aparecerás mencionado en la web en la lista de las personas a las que les interesa el país.Productor Ciudadano: Donando USD 50 o más, te convertís en Productor Ciudadano.

America’s got a race problem. You know it. I know it. To make change, we have to get people talking — and listening — about race, about who they are, about their fears, misunderstandings, and dreams. 

Fiction is a great way to broach these topics. Discussing a book with imaginary characters who do and say real-seeming things gives readers a less threatening way to start talking about the hard stuff. 

In April, University of Wisconsin Press will publish Meet Me Halfway, my collection of nine interconnected short stories about race and racism in hyper-segregated Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  

This campaign will fund my Meet Me Halfway road trip to the 10 most segregated cities in America — Milwaukee, Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Boston, New York, Miami, and Los Angeles — to reach out to readers and to contribute to some long-overdue conversations about race. 

Think of it as a book tour+plus: I’ll do the readings at bookstores and colleges, but I will also make myself available to churches, schools, community groups, and workplaces, to facilitate conversations based on one or more of the Meet Me Halfway stories. I might also take a page from the late activist Fran Peavey and sit in a park or two with a sign that says, “American willing to talk about race.” Throughout the journey, I’ll document what I hear and share it with you on my MoralesWrites blog.

I’m a long-time activist, writer, performer, and mom who lived in Milwaukee for nearly 25 years. I raised my children there, where they graduated from the public schools. I was an elected official, a Sunday School teacher, and a volunteer, working on issues of education, workers’ rights, women’s issues, LGBT rights, and environmental justice. In the roots of each of these struggles, I found race and racism tangled up. I want a better future for us and for our children.


What We Need & What You Get
To make this road trip happen, we need to borrow, rent, or buy a small RV (the Bookmobile!) that will allow us to travel cost-effectively, as well as buy gas, food, and supplies. I also need the services of a publicist and maybe a logistics assistant to make sure we cram in as many events as possible on this tour. And I’ll be writing and printing a discussion guide for book clubs, classes, and other groups to use on the tour and beyond. 

What you get are some great opportunities to be part of the journey without leaving home — and maybe get some help and inspiration for your own writing. 

The Impact
By publishing Meet Me Halfway, the University of Wisconsin Press has done something most publishers are afraid to do: publish a fiction book that faces race and racism head-on. Still, UWP is an academic press and it doesn’t have the big marketing departments and resources of the New York houses. 

By contributing to this tour, you will help get this risky book out there and let the publishing world know that the public wants more books that look honestly at race in America and challenge readers to make change. 

Other Ways You Can Help

The price is $45. It includes a physical copy of the book and a free download of the PDF Edition. </p><h2>Update + stretch goal</h2><p>With three days to go we’ve hit 100%. Thank you all for making what is among my wildest of dreams a little less inchoate.</p><p><strong>Stretch goal</strong>: Hit $12,000 and I will take a <a href=""https://www.dji.com/spark"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DJI Spark</a> drone for aerial footage of the journey.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Last year, <a href=""https://www.gaiagps.com/public/6aTAriUNBcZNFuzZNozgQaqB"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">I walked 4,300 kilometers</a> along the back roads of Japan’s four main islands: Kyushu, Shikoku, Honshu, and Hokkaido. I crossed the mountainous interior of Shikoku in May 2017. It took only two weeks but it was the most interesting part of my 18-week journey across Japan. On the penultimate day, I walked through a village where nine out of ten houses were in ruins — but you could still get a cold Coke from a vending machine and walk on a perfectly surfaced road, while jetliners overhead were extending their landing gear on their approach to Osaka, one of the supercities of the world. On Shikoku, I found the melancholy future of the developed world.</p><p><strong>Now I want to go back so I can show you.</strong> If this campaign is successful, you will be able to follow online as I walk across the wilds of Shikoku in the dead of winter, then, after I’ve made it across, read my printed field report.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543791009/mwbumk8tnsmzgaoilzsl.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Sketch of my proposed route across Shikoku</i></p><p>Shikoku is the smallest of Japan’s four main islands. It wasn’t until 30 years ago that one could reach it by road or rail. It is best known for the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikoku_Pilgrimage"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shikoku Henro</a>, where Buddhist pilgrims dressed in white circumambulate the island to visit 88 of its temples. On my walk, I will not follow the pilgrims’ path, but the roads of the island’s sparsely populated interior, from Shikoku’s <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/itMLmy39V7J2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">easternmost point</a> to <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/R2u3JADgCft"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">its westernmost</a>.</p><p><i>The Wilds of Shikoku</i> will be the story of the price we pay to live in comfort. Cities everywhere are growing and the countryside is fading away, while we celebrate the handcrafted beauty of country life from the comforts of our city homes. Shikoku makes this story more visible than any other place I know. If you live anywhere in the developed world, it is probably your story, too. I know it is mine.</p><p><strong>With your help, we can turn this story into a printed, tangible artifact</strong>, and also offer some very special perks.</p><h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2><p>Apart from the costs of pre-production, which we have already covered, <i>The Wilds of Shikoku</i> will have five main expenses:</p><ol>
<li>Getting to Japan (airfare, insurance, train tickets)</li>
<li>Equipment (electronics, winter gear)</li>
<li>Walking across Shikoku (food, bathhouse fees, data cards)</li>
<li>Our collaborators’ fees</li>
<li>Production and printing costs for the Field Report</li>
</ol><p>We are pricing the campaign for the break-even point. Stay tuned for stretch goals if we go beyond our goal!</p><p>If the campaign is successfully funded, I will go to Japan in January 2019 and walk across Shikoku in late January to early February. If you contribute, and the campaign is a success, you will get:</p><h3>1. THE FIELD REPORT</h3><p>The ultimate aim of this journey is to produce a beautifully crafted and printed Field Report about what I saw on my 500-kilometer walk across some of the most remote parts of Japan in the dead of winter.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://img.kzamm.com/dude_she_is_reading_blank_pages_write_something.gif"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>32 A3-sized pages of 105 g/m^2 cream-colored Awagami from Tokushima, Japan, our target for the Field Report. It feels substantial to hold.</i></p><p>The specifics:</p><ul>
<li>It’s big: <strong>32 A3-sized pages</strong> (29.7 × 42 cm / 11.69"" × 16.53""), printed on 105 g/m^2, off-white German or Japanese paper, weighing in total 210 grams (0.46 pounds)</li>
<li>Featuring a <strong>hand-painted watercolor map of Shikoku</strong> by British illustrator Alice Cleary</li>
<li>Between <strong>10,000–15,000 words</strong> (the length of a very long magazine article)</li>
<li>Dozens of <strong>original photographs</strong> by the author</li>
<li>Altitude and distance profile charts</li>
</ul><p>Patrons of the <strong>Digital Pack</strong> will receive the Field Report in PDF format, printable at either A4 or US Letter size.</p><p>The Field Report will be written and produced after I complete the walk. Based on the conversations we’ve had with our graphic designer and our printer, it will be done by the end of April 2019. We aim to <strong>have them in the mail by May 1, 2019</strong> (incidentally, the first day of Japan’s next imperial era).</p><h3>2. REAL TIME BROADCAST</h3><p>From my first steps leaving Cape Gamouda, Shikoku’s easternmost point, until I reach Cape Sada, its westernmost, <strong>you will be able to follow my walk online</strong>, in close to real time.

I will re-visit some of these people and will in all likelihood meet others just as interesting. Such is the nature of long-distance walking.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543801809/y8p7poyoxisdcrxdkmbs.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Roadside statues on the Sadamisaki Peninsula, Ehime Prefecture, Shikoku, on May 6, 2017</i></p><p>I will carry two cameras and an iPhone, and post several times a day to Instagram and YouTube.

She has already sketched it out and will paint it when the campaign is successfully funded.

They will stand on their own and will also be suitable for framing.</p><p>Unlike the Field Report, which will be for sale on <i>The Wilds of Shikoku</i> website after the campaign is over, <strong>the prints will only be available for the duration of our campaign</strong>. If you want one, make a pledge by December 24, 2018.</p><h3>4. ARTISANAL INDIGO TENUGUI, MADE ON SHIKOKU</h3><p>The prefecture of Tokushima in Shikoku has been for centuries the center of Japanese indigo production: the plant-based fermented dye responsible for the magnificent color also referred to as Japan Blue. After the country opened to the West in the 19th century, the indigo industry was decimated by synthetic dyes.

ALAN BOOTH’S ESSAY COLLECTION, SIGNED BY EDITOR TIMOTHY HARRIS</h3><p>If you’re reading this, you probably need no introduction to Alan Booth. He is the late author of <i>The Roads to Sata</i>, the famous travel book about his walk across three of Japan’s four main islands. Several years later, he traveled to the fourth, Shikoku, to walk across its mountainous interior. Until a few months ago, you had to have been on a Japan Airlines flight in early 1985 to have read the account of his walk, because it was published by <i>WINDS</i>, the airline’s in-flight magazine.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543791663/ygharzgpuh0c2esno9yh.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Alan Booth (right) with Timothy Harris, both looking very theatrical. Photo by Stuart Varnam-Atkin</i></p><p>But Timothy Harris, Booth’s close friend and editor, recently put together an anthology of Booth’s uncollected writings, <a href=""https://brightwavemedia.com/booth.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">This Great Stage of Fools</a>, which includes the account of Booth’s walk across Shikoku, titled <i>Roads Out of Time</i>.</p><p><strong>Tim has graciously offered to sign copies of the anthology</strong> for supporters of this campaign. Here is an excerpt from his introduction to <i>Roads Out of Time</i>:</p><blockquote><p>He decided to [walk across Shikoku] along the island’s longest axis: east to west — a five-hundred-kilometer walk. The walk was, of course, accomplished in a fraction of the time the longer journey took — eighteen days as opposed to four months — but, day for day, it was at least as hard, since Alan had chosen to walk not along the coast, but through the mountains and hills of the island’s interior — country as remote and rugged as any in Japan.</p></blockquote><p>I had not known of Booth’s walk across Shikoku when I walked across the island in 2017, but we crossed the island on very similar paths (<i>more on this if you read on</i>). In memory of his life and his work, the walk I plan to complete for <i>The Wilds of Shikoku</i> will follow in his footsteps exactly, as far as they can be reconstructed from his account.</p><h3>6. A PRIVATE PRESENTATION OF MY WALK</h3><p>In every journey there are stories that don’t make it into any Field Report. Stories too extraordinary to be believable, too personal to print, too ephemeral to publish. These are some of the best stories. You have them, too. After the Field Report is printed and mailed, <strong>I will tell the story behind the story</strong> of <i>The Wilds of Shikoku</i>. This will be in the form of a 60-minute presentation, with unpublished pictures, followed by free-form conversation. The ideal setting for this would be a small group eager for strangeness and adventure: your institute, your startup, your school.</p><p>This rewards is <strong>limited to 2 backers</strong>. You can choose any location in the world (the cost does not include me getting there).</p><h3>7. A PRIVATE WALK ACROSS SHIKOKU</h3><blockquote>
<p>I have the feeling that I can write on these enormous partitions, of 3,000 or 4,000 meters high, as a professor writes on a blackboard with a chalk. But I don’t only make that to write these lines, these imaginary lines, I live these lines. I also have the impression that after, these lines remain there, even though I am the only one that can feel them, see them, that I live them and nobody else will ever be able to see them, but they are there and they will remain forever there.</p>

</blockquote><p>The world is a palimpsest of imaginary lines and we all walk in the footsteps of others. Alan Booth <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Looking-Lost-Journeys-Vanishing-Kodansha/dp/1568361483"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">once followed the steps of Saigo Takamori</a>, the brooding 19th-century samurai with a dog named Tsun, and last year I unwittingly retraced the footsteps of Alan Booth across Shikoku.</p><p>Works of art about travel and walking have exerted a disproportionate influence on my imagination, and I have often felt their authors loom large in my life. For this campaign I’m offering something I have never been able to do myself: <strong>to experience a work with its author in its original setting</strong>.</p><p>For <strong>one supporter</strong> of <i>The Wilds of Shikoku</i>, I’m offering the chance to re-walk the exact path of my walk. We will go together, at a time of your choice, across this beautiful and haunted island, in the footsteps of Alan Booth, myself, and countless others, to which we will add our own, and nobody else will ever be able to see them, but they will be there, and they will remain forever there.</p><h2>About Peter</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543792296/rrjdeiegztoir1t7tloe.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Photo by Kyoko Nishimoto</i></p><p>Peter Orosz is a peripatetic writer and photographer.

She served me a simple Japanese breakfast of miso soup, braised potatoes, and mountain vegetables she had picked herself. She is the creator of an art project about the depopulation of her village, where she makes a life-sized cloth doll for every villager who moves away or dies. Her dolls now vastly outnumber the humans in Nagoro. Her life and her work were the focus of <a href=""https://vimeo.com/92453765"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Valley of Dolls</a>, a short documentary film by the German journalist Fritz Schumann.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543802269/oylnogiugus0r46xoemg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Ayano Tsukimi chilling in front of her house on May 17, 2017</i></p><p>On that beautiful spring day, it was hard to see the harshness of life in Nagoro. But after breakfast, Ms. Tsukimi showed me pictures of her life in winter. On this gentle subtropical island, known for its temples and tangerines, she stood waist-deep in the snow in front of her old wooden house, which was heated by a single charcoal burner and connected to the outside world across a mile-high pass in the mountains. Barely more than 200 kilometers away, across that pass and two great bridges, lay Osaka, one of the world’s biggest cities. Its canyons of glass and steel could have been another planet, one vastly more massive than little Nagoro, with an irresistible gravity.</p><p>Here was the star of a film seen by more than 500,000 people, living in a country which loses the same number of people every year. Her spacious wooden house is a thing of handcrafted beauty. Wildflowers drop into the cold spring water of her drink cooler, and she breathes the pure mountain air. Her aesthetically pleasing life is also unimaginably hard, and it’s a lifestyle that doesn’t survive contact with the big city. The quiet forests and the verdant mountains don’t stand a chance against the siren song of 24/7 convenience stores and central heating, and this contrast is brought into sharp focus in the winter, when nature is at its cruelest, and the life to be lived there has very little to do with how we imagine life in the developed world.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543802598/otrnbzjofu9oi84ruirj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The schoolhouse of Nagoro, Tokushima Prefecture, Shikoku, on May 17, 2017</i></p><p>The sort of country life we find beautiful only exists until the people who live it have no choice. Once they do, they leave it behind. No young professional will move back to a place like Nagoro from Osaka. And couples with young children definitely won’t: the village school is closed, and the bridge across the river which leads to it lies unrepaired, guarded by two of Ms. Tsukimi’s dolls.</p><p>Whatever I will experience on my walk will never approach the hardness of daily life in a village. But maybe, over weeks of walking, there will be moments when I will be able to see it, so I can write about it truthfully. About how we shed our beautiful clothes, how we leave our beautiful houses, how we stop making our delicious food, how we may lose our language, and how, in return, we get a comfortable life. And once we’re comfortable, we realize what we had lost. This is what I want to show you in <i>The Wilds of Shikoku</i>.</p><h2>Why Follow Alan Booth’s Path?</h2><p>In the summer and autumn of 1977, the British writer Alan Booth walked the length of Japan from the northernmost cape of Hokkaido to the southernmost cape of Kyushu. A few years later, he wrote an account of his journey, <i>The Roads to Sata</i>, which became one of the classics of 20th century travel writing.</p><p>It was one of the books which inspired my own walk across Japan, so much so that I titled my field notes from the journey <i>The Roads from Sata</i>. I had set out, in April 2017, to retrace his steps, but the gravity of the mountains pulled me into Japan’s interior. Our paths barely crossed and our walks differed in almost every way. While Booth walked from north to south, followed the coastline when possible, avoided the mountains, and slept in country inns, I walked from south to east, traversed as many mountains as possible, and slept in shacks, shrines, and under the stars. But the main difference was that he never set foot on Shikoku.</p><p>On my way home, in August 2017, I stopped in Tokyo to meet Timothy Harris, Alan Booth’s old friend and editor (Booth himself passed away in 1993). Over a couple of excellent beers in Shinjuku, Tim mentioned that in 1983, six years after his walk across Japan, Alan went back to Shikoku and walked across it as well — following not the pilgrims’ path but in a straight line across the island’s mountainous interior. And so, unwittingly, I retraced his steps in the very place where I had thought there were no steps of his to be retraced.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543802692/xeje4gw5ev63dylzggpf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Roads Out of Time</i>, Alan’s account of his walk across Shikoku, was published in February 1985 by <i>WINDS</i>, the in-flight magazine of Japan Airlines. At our meeting Tim told me that he was working on an anthology of Alan’s unpublished writings, which would include the story of his Shikoku walk. The anthology, titled <a href=""https://brightwavemedia.com/booth.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">This Great Stage of Fools</a>, was published earlier this year by Bright Wave Media. When I received my copy, I was astonished to read that he had walked on many of the same roads as I had, in many cases across the same villages, making very similar observations along the way.</p><p>That’s when I decided that I would go back to Shikoku. To follow in Alan’s footsteps and to retrace mine, to treat his account as a screenplay to be staged, to try to see with his eyes what became of the wilds of Shikoku 36 years later.</p><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>I have been walking alone for years and have covered over 6,000 kilometers in the past three years on walks ranging from three days to four months, in Croatia, Iran, Iraq, Hungary, Japan, and Serbia. I walk with a 10-kilogram rucksack and sleep where I fancy. I have been writing and taking photographs for an audience for 15 years. <i>The Wilds of Shikoku</i> builds on these skills.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543803073/jpbxsck2nwlkc5osq3gk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The author in Higashinaruse, Akita Prefecture, on the 92nd day of his walk across Japan. Photo by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BXWmVl0FLEq/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tadashi Honma</a>.</i></p><h3>The Walk</h3><p><strong>Low-to-medium risk.</strong> I’m in good physical condition for my 38 years, with no known medical issues. I have a good set of gear that I would trust my life to. I have walked in temperatures ranging from –15 °C to +45 °C, from sea level to above 4,000 meters. With my pack, I can comfortably cover 40 kilometers with 1,000 meters of elevation gain in a day, 55 with 2,000 if I have to push it. I would say low risk, period, but in Japan the weather can get interesting, particularly in the mountains in January.</p><h3>The Field Report</h3><p><strong>Low risk.</strong> We have a graphic design team in place, and a printer we’ve worked with for 20 years. Once I have the report written and proofed, they will get to work.</p><h3>The Online Broadcast</h3><p><strong>Low risk.</strong> I may be going into the mountains, but this is still Japan: if my phone breaks I can replace it within a day, and these days you need nothing else to broadcast.</p><h3>The Map</h3><p><strong>Low risk.</strong> Alice painted the sketch you see in a day. Imagine what she’ll be able to do when she has a full week at her disposal.</p><h3>The Tenugui</h3><p><strong>Low risk.</strong> Hanga is a proper Japanese artisan who has been doing this for 20+ years. She has a vat of fermented indigo dye in her own bathroom, just in case.</p><h3>The Alan Booth Book</h3><p><strong>Low risk.</strong> The books are printed, and they’re warehoused in Tokyo, where Timothy Harris will sign them and the publisher will ship them out from.</p><h3>The Private Presentation</h3><p><strong>Low risk.</strong> One cannot walk 500 kilometers and leave without very interesting stories.</p><h3>The Private Walk</h3><p><strong>Low-to-medium risk.</strong> You can do this with zero preparation. If you don’t believe me, ask <a href=""http://orosz.space"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my brother</a>, who flew out of his office last year to join me for the last 1,000 kilometers of my walk across Japan. But there is always the weather.

Final update: The book is finished and available for saleYou can buy a copy of The Wilds of Shikoku here. The price is $45. It includes a physical copy of the book and a free download of the PDF Edition. Update + stretch goalWith three days to go we’ve hit 100%. Thank you all for making what is among my wildest of dreams a little less inchoate.Stretch goal: Hit $12,000 and I will take a DJI Spark drone for aerial footage of the journey.IntroductionLast year, I walked 4,300 kilometers along the back roads of Japan’s four main islands: Kyushu, Shikoku, Honshu, and Hokkaido. I crossed the mountainous interior of Shikoku in May 2017. It took only two weeks but it was the most interesting part of my 18-week journey across Japan. On the penultimate day, I walked through a village where nine out of ten houses were in ruins — but you could still get a cold Coke from a vending machine and walk on a perfectly surfaced road, while jetliners overhead were extending their landing gear on their approach to Osaka, one of the supercities of the world. On Shikoku, I found the melancholy future of the developed world.Now I want to go back so I can show you. If this campaign is successful, you will be able to follow online as I walk across the wilds of Shikoku in the dead of winter, then, after I’ve made it across, read my printed field report.Sketch of my proposed route across ShikokuShikoku is the smallest of Japan’s four main islands. It wasn’t until 30 years ago that one could reach it by road or rail. It is best known for the Shikoku Henro, where Buddhist pilgrims dressed in white circumambulate the island to visit 88 of its temples. On my walk, I will not follow the pilgrims’ path, but the roads of the island’s sparsely populated interior, from Shikoku’s easternmost point to its westernmost.The Wilds of Shikoku will be the story of the price we pay to live in comfort. Cities everywhere are growing and the countryside is fading away, while we celebrate the handcrafted beauty of country life from the comforts of our city homes. Shikoku makes this story more visible than any other place I know. If you live anywhere in the developed world, it is probably your story, too. I know it is mine.With your help, we can turn this story into a printed, tangible artifact, and also offer some very special perks.What We Need & What You GetApart from the costs of pre-production, which we have already covered, The Wilds of Shikoku will have five main expenses:
Getting to Japan (airfare, insurance, train tickets)
Equipment (electronics, winter gear)
Walking across Shikoku (food, bathhouse fees, data cards)
Our collaborators’ fees
Production and printing costs for the Field Report
We are pricing the campaign for the break-even point. Stay tuned for stretch goals if we go beyond our goal!If the campaign is successfully funded, I will go to Japan in January 2019 and walk across Shikoku in late January to early February. If you contribute, and the campaign is a success, you will get:1. THE FIELD REPORTThe ultimate aim of this journey is to produce a beautifully crafted and printed Field Report about what I saw on my 500-kilometer walk across some of the most remote parts of Japan in the dead of winter.32 A3-sized pages of 105 g/m^2 cream-colored Awagami from Tokushima, Japan, our target for the Field Report. It feels substantial to hold.The specifics:
It’s big: 32 A3-sized pages (29.7 × 42 cm / 11.69"" × 16.53""), printed on 105 g/m^2, off-white German or Japanese paper, weighing in total 210 grams (0.46 pounds)
Featuring a hand-painted watercolor map of Shikoku by British illustrator Alice Cleary
Between 10,000–15,000 words (the length of a very long magazine article)
Dozens of original photographs by the author
Altitude and distance profile charts
Patrons of the Digital Pack will receive the Field Report in PDF format, printable at either A4 or US Letter size.The Field Report will be written and produced after I complete the walk. Based on the conversations we’ve had with our graphic designer and our printer, it will be done by the end of April 2019. We aim to have them in the mail by May 1, 2019 (incidentally, the first day of Japan’s next imperial era).2. REAL TIME BROADCASTFrom my first steps leaving Cape Gamouda, Shikoku’s easternmost point, until I reach Cape Sada, its westernmost, you will be able to follow my walk online, in close to real time. What will you see? Apart from the staggering beauty of the land, I have no idea.Sunset over Tosa-cho, Kochi Prefecture, Shikoku, on May 14, 2017the ninth day of my walk across the islandBut last year, when I walked across Shikoku, I met, among others, a French carpenter restoring an old Japanese house in the mountains, a Columbia University PhD from Tokyo who was employed by a village to re-design its education system, a naked man who asked me if I was from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a beekeeper with a sniper rifle employed to cull the deer which threaten to overrun the rice fields, a Hungarian world champion kayaker teaching junior high school in a mountain village, and an agricultural engineer who happens to be the highest-ranked swordsman in Eastern Shikoku. I will re-visit some of these people and will in all likelihood meet others just as interesting. Such is the nature of long-distance walking.Roadside statues on the Sadamisaki Peninsula, Ehime Prefecture, Shikoku, on May 6, 2017I will carry two cameras and an iPhone, and post several times a day to Instagram and YouTube. The broadcast will be freely available for everyone, and archived on The Wilds of Shikoku website (to be launched in Summer 2019). For examples of similar broadcasts from my other journeys, see The Roads from Sata (my 4,300-kilometer walk across Japan in 2017) and Autocracy Holidays (an 8,000-kilometer road trip from Kazakhstan across Xinjiang, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Iran to Iraqi Kurdistan, in 2018).3. LIMITED EDITION MAP PRINTSThe centerpiece of the Field Report will be a hand-painted watercolor map of Shikoku by the London-based illustrator Alice Cleary. She has already sketched it out and will paint it when the campaign is successfully funded. Alice works for print magazines and you may have come across her paintings and maps in Delicious Magazine, Delicious Australia, Great British Food, and Veggie Magazine.This is not the final map, just a sketch on Alice’s worktableWe will be offering limited edition art prints of the map. Alice will paint the original at A3 (29.7 × 42 cm / 11.69"" × 16.53""). Our prints, mounted on thick cardboard, will be at the same size. They will stand on their own and will also be suitable for framing.Unlike the Field Report, which will be for sale on The Wilds of Shikoku website after the campaign is over, the prints will only be available for the duration of our campaign. If you want one, make a pledge by December 24, 2018.4. ARTISANAL INDIGO TENUGUI, MADE ON SHIKOKUThe prefecture of Tokushima in Shikoku has been for centuries the center of Japanese indigo production: the plant-based fermented dye responsible for the magnificent color also referred to as Japan Blue. After the country opened to the West in the 19th century, the indigo industry was decimated by synthetic dyes. It is now experiencing a quiet comeback, and Hanga Yoshihara-Horvath, a Hungarian-Japanese artist, is one of the figures in the center of this revival.Photo by Kyoko NishimotoHanga, a classically trained textile artist, has lived in Tokushima for a decade with her husband, the indigo researcher Hitoshi Yoshihara, and their son Mihály Aoi. Her indigo work combines the Japanese techniques of sashiko (decorative stitching) and shibori (resist dyeing) with traditional Hungarian patterns and motifs.Hanga will design and dye original tenugui — traditional Japanese cotton towels — for the supporters of The Wilds of Shikoku. They will be approximately 35×90 centimeters in size. Tenugui can be used for practically any purpose that calls for a piece of cloth: you can tie it around your forehead on a hot day, wrap stuff in it, use it in the bath as a washcloth, and so on. Artisanal handmade tenugui, like the ones Hanga will make, can also be hung and displayed. You can read more about tenugui in this article on Tofugu.​Photo by Kyoko NishimotoWe will limit the number of tenugui Hanga makes to the number of days it will take me to walk across Shikoku. We are offering 10 pieces for sale during the campaign.5. ALAN BOOTH’S ESSAY COLLECTION, SIGNED BY EDITOR TIMOTHY HARRISIf you’re reading this, you probably need no introduction to Alan Booth. He is the late author of The Roads to Sata, the famous travel book about his walk across three of Japan’s four main islands. Several years later, he traveled to the fourth, Shikoku, to walk across its mountainous interior. Until a few months ago, you had to have been on a Japan Airlines flight in early 1985 to have read the account of his walk, because it was published by WINDS, the airline’s in-flight magazine.Alan Booth (right) with Timothy Harris, both looking very theatrical. Photo by Stuart Varnam-AtkinBut Timothy Harris, Booth’s close friend and editor, recently put together an anthology of Booth’s uncollected writings, This Great Stage of Fools, which includes the account of Booth’s walk across Shikoku, titled Roads Out of Time.Tim has graciously offered to sign copies of the anthology for supporters of this campaign. Here is an excerpt from his introduction to Roads Out of Time:He decided to [walk across Shikoku] along the island’s longest axis: east to west — a five-hundred-kilometer walk. The walk was, of course, accomplished in a fraction of the time the longer journey took — eighteen days as opposed to four months — but, day for day, it was at least as hard, since Alan had chosen to walk not along the coast, but through the mountains and hills of the island’s interior — country as remote and rugged as any in Japan.I had not known of Booth’s walk across Shikoku when I walked across the island in 2017, but we crossed the island on very similar paths (more on this if you read on). In memory of his life and his work, the walk I plan to complete for The Wilds of Shikoku will follow in his footsteps exactly, as far as they can be reconstructed from his account.6. A PRIVATE PRESENTATION OF MY WALKIn every journey there are stories that don’t make it into any Field Report. Stories too extraordinary to be believable, too personal to print, too ephemeral to publish. These are some of the best stories. You have them, too. After the Field Report is printed and mailed, I will tell the story behind the story of The Wilds of Shikoku. This will be in the form of a 60-minute presentation, with unpublished pictures, followed by free-form conversation. The ideal setting for this would be a small group eager for strangeness and adventure: your institute, your startup, your school.This rewards is limited to 2 backers. You can choose any location in the world (the cost does not include me getting there).7. A PRIVATE WALK ACROSS SHIKOKU
I have the feeling that I can write on these enormous partitions, of 3,000 or 4,000 meters high, as a professor writes on a blackboard with a chalk. But I don’t only make that to write these lines, these imaginary lines, I live these lines. I also have the impression that after, these lines remain there, even though I am the only one that can feel them, see them, that I live them and nobody else will ever be able to see them, but they are there and they will remain forever there.
— Reinhold Messner, in Werner Herzog’s The Dark Glow of the Mountains
The world is a palimpsest of imaginary lines and we all walk in the footsteps of others. Alan Booth once followed the steps of Saigo Takamori, the brooding 19th-century samurai with a dog named Tsun, and last year I unwittingly retraced the footsteps of Alan Booth across Shikoku.Works of art about travel and walking have exerted a disproportionate influence on my imagination, and I have often felt their authors loom large in my life. For this campaign I’m offering something I have never been able to do myself: to experience a work with its author in its original setting.For one supporter of The Wilds of Shikoku, I’m offering the chance to re-walk the exact path of my walk. We will go together, at a time of your choice, across this beautiful and haunted island, in the footsteps of Alan Booth, myself, and countless others, to which we will add our own, and nobody else will ever be able to see them, but they will be there, and they will remain forever there.About PeterPhoto by Kyoko NishimotoPeter Orosz is a peripatetic writer and photographer. In 2017, he walked 4,300 kilometers across Japan from the south of Kyushu to the east of Hokkaido. A year before, he walked 850 kilometers across the Zagros Mountains from Hamadan, Iran to Erbil, Iraq. Back when he wasn’t walking, he wrote for Roads & Kingdoms, Wired, Jalopnik, and other websites, and served as an editorial manager at Gawker Media.Why Walk in Winter?In May 2017, on my walk across Shikoku, I had breakfast with Ayano Tsukimi, a lady who lives in a mountain village named Nagoro. She served me a simple Japanese breakfast of miso soup, braised potatoes, and mountain vegetables she had picked herself. She is the creator of an art project about the depopulation of her village, where she makes a life-sized cloth doll for every villager who moves away or dies. Her dolls now vastly outnumber the humans in Nagoro. Her life and her work were the focus of Valley of Dolls, a short documentary film by the German journalist Fritz Schumann.Ayano Tsukimi chilling in front of her house on May 17, 2017On that beautiful spring day, it was hard to see the harshness of life in Nagoro. But after breakfast, Ms. Tsukimi showed me pictures of her life in winter. On this gentle subtropical island, known for its temples and tangerines, she stood waist-deep in the snow in front of her old wooden house, which was heated by a single charcoal burner and connected to the outside world across a mile-high pass in the mountains. Barely more than 200 kilometers away, across that pass and two great bridges, lay Osaka, one of the world’s biggest cities. Its canyons of glass and steel could have been another planet, one vastly more massive than little Nagoro, with an irresistible gravity.Here was the star of a film seen by more than 500,000 people, living in a country which loses the same number of people every year. Her spacious wooden house is a thing of handcrafted beauty. Wildflowers drop into the cold spring water of her drink cooler, and she breathes the pure mountain air. Her aesthetically pleasing life is also unimaginably hard, and it’s a lifestyle that doesn’t survive contact with the big city. The quiet forests and the verdant mountains don’t stand a chance against the siren song of 24/7 convenience stores and central heating, and this contrast is brought into sharp focus in the winter, when nature is at its cruelest, and the life to be lived there has very little to do with how we imagine life in the developed world.The schoolhouse of Nagoro, Tokushima Prefecture, Shikoku, on May 17, 2017The sort of country life we find beautiful only exists until the people who live it have no choice. Once they do, they leave it behind. No young professional will move back to a place like Nagoro from Osaka. And couples with young children definitely won’t: the village school is closed, and the bridge across the river which leads to it lies unrepaired, guarded by two of Ms. Tsukimi’s dolls.Whatever I will experience on my walk will never approach the hardness of daily life in a village. But maybe, over weeks of walking, there will be moments when I will be able to see it, so I can write about it truthfully. About how we shed our beautiful clothes, how we leave our beautiful houses, how we stop making our delicious food, how we may lose our language, and how, in return, we get a comfortable life. And once we’re comfortable, we realize what we had lost. This is what I want to show you in The Wilds of Shikoku.Why Follow Alan Booth’s Path?In the summer and autumn of 1977, the British writer Alan Booth walked the length of Japan from the northernmost cape of Hokkaido to the southernmost cape of Kyushu. A few years later, he wrote an account of his journey, The Roads to Sata, which became one of the classics of 20th century travel writing.It was one of the books which inspired my own walk across Japan, so much so that I titled my field notes from the journey The Roads from Sata. I had set out, in April 2017, to retrace his steps, but the gravity of the mountains pulled me into Japan’s interior. Our paths barely crossed and our walks differed in almost every way. While Booth walked from north to south, followed the coastline when possible, avoided the mountains, and slept in country inns, I walked from south to east, traversed as many mountains as possible, and slept in shacks, shrines, and under the stars. But the main difference was that he never set foot on Shikoku.On my way home, in August 2017, I stopped in Tokyo to meet Timothy Harris, Alan Booth’s old friend and editor (Booth himself passed away in 1993). Over a couple of excellent beers in Shinjuku, Tim mentioned that in 1983, six years after his walk across Japan, Alan went back to Shikoku and walked across it as well — following not the pilgrims’ path but in a straight line across the island’s mountainous interior. And so, unwittingly, I retraced his steps in the very place where I had thought there were no steps of his to be retraced.Roads Out of Time, Alan’s account of his walk across Shikoku, was published in February 1985 by WINDS, the in-flight magazine of Japan Airlines. At our meeting Tim told me that he was working on an anthology of Alan’s unpublished writings, which would include the story of his Shikoku walk. The anthology, titled This Great Stage of Fools, was published earlier this year by Bright Wave Media. When I received my copy, I was astonished to read that he had walked on many of the same roads as I had, in many cases across the same villages, making very similar observations along the way.That’s when I decided that I would go back to Shikoku. To follow in Alan’s footsteps and to retrace mine, to treat his account as a screenplay to be staged, to try to see with his eyes what became of the wilds of Shikoku 36 years later.Risks & ChallengesI have been walking alone for years and have covered over 6,000 kilometers in the past three years on walks ranging from three days to four months, in Croatia, Iran, Iraq, Hungary, Japan, and Serbia. I walk with a 10-kilogram rucksack and sleep where I fancy. I have been writing and taking photographs for an audience for 15 years. The Wilds of Shikoku builds on these skills.The author in Higashinaruse, Akita Prefecture, on the 92nd day of his walk across Japan. Photo by Tadashi Honma.The WalkLow-to-medium risk. I’m in good physical condition for my 38 years, with no known medical issues. I have a good set of gear that I would trust my life to. I have walked in temperatures ranging from –15 °C to +45 °C, from sea level to above 4,000 meters. With my pack, I can comfortably cover 40 kilometers with 1,000 meters of elevation gain in a day, 55 with 2,000 if I have to push it. I would say low risk, period, but in Japan the weather can get interesting, particularly in the mountains in January.The Field ReportLow risk. We have a graphic design team in place, and a printer we’ve worked with for 20 years. Once I have the report written and proofed, they will get to work.The Online BroadcastLow risk. I may be going into the mountains, but this is still Japan: if my phone breaks I can replace it within a day, and these days you need nothing else to broadcast.The MapLow risk. Alice painted the sketch you see in a day. Imagine what she’ll be able to do when she has a full week at her disposal.The TenuguiLow risk. Hanga is a proper Japanese artisan who has been doing this for 20+ years. She has a vat of fermented indigo dye in her own bathroom, just in case.The Alan Booth BookLow risk. The books are printed, and they’re warehoused in Tokyo, where Timothy Harris will sign them and the publisher will ship them out from.The Private PresentationLow risk. One cannot walk 500 kilometers and leave without very interesting stories.The Private WalkLow-to-medium risk. You can do this with zero preparation. If you don’t believe me, ask my brother, who flew out of his office last year to join me for the last 1,000 kilometers of my walk across Japan. But there is always the weather. See above. Also, the spirits: You have to be on good terms with them.Media

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p>My name is Charisse M. Williams and I am the author of <i>Thriving While Black</i>. This book was inspired by my experience of thriving in one of the most challenging years I have lived--2020. I was curious about how other Black folks were thriving and what was enabling it, so I decided to find out. <br/><br/><i>Thriving While Black</i> is about the intersection of race and wellbeing in America. It focuses on twelve themes that contribute to thriving including purpose, self-love, community and hope.<br/><br/>Part memoir, part guide, <i>Thriving While Black</i> chronicles my experience navigating 2020. It also shares the stories from my interviews with a diverse group of over fifty extraordinary African Americans.<br/><br/>One of them is Angie O’Neal. A two-time breast cancer survivor, Angie completed her first marathon not long after going through chemotherapy for the second time. Inspired by family and with the support of her community, she accomplished something that years earlier was only in her dreams.<br/><br/>I also share the story of Ryan Wilson whose sense of purpose, nurtured from a very young age, led to the founding of The Gathering Spot, a membership club that serves as a hub for collaboration, connections and experiences, changing the way we build community.<br/><br/>Then there’s Adeola Whitney. The Coronavirus pandemic and gym closures inspired her to take daily long walks with her husband. Those walks improved their health, fortified their marriage and helped them make really important decisions for their family, including her pursuit of her role as CEO of a national nonprofit.<br/><br/>Finally, I share the story of Lama Rod Owens, Buddhist teacher, author and activist who earned his title of “Lama” meaning “teacher” through a mostly silent, three-year training. Lama Rod models how we can use self-love to transform ourselves and the world.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy reading inspiring stories about people leading extraordinary lives and making a profound impact on the world. You will also learn how we use the power of reframing to find hope, gratitude and opportunity in any situation, especially in 2020.</p>

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<p><i>Mama Eats First</i> is a book about the transition to motherhood and how to optimize the first forty days after birth to truly support the recovery and emergence of the newborn mom. <br/><br/>My name is Elizabeth Schieffelin Liao and I am the author of <i>Mama Eats First</i>. I wrote this book because moms need more support than what our system and culture offer now. With the right tools and loving guidance, newborn moms can create an environment that allows for deep healing, recovery and a transition into a thriving, empowered experience. <br/><br/>I was inspired to write this book because our country is in crisis. Newborn mothers are not being taken care of by the system at large, our culture, and many communities. We face many challenges including: </p>
<ul>
<li>Many moms hold the belief that asking for help is sign of weakness, failure or being a burden.</li>
<li>Shame, ""mom guilt"", and feelings of not being enough are felt by so many women. </li>
<li>Abdominal pain, aches, even incontinence are considered par-for-the-course of motherhood. </li>
<li>Women are being medicated at higher rates and report feeling less supported and more stressed than at any other point in history. </li>
<li>The US is the only developed country with a <i>rising</i> maternal mortality rate.</li>
<li>Our culture tells new moms to “bounce back” instead of embracing and loving their new bodies. </li>
<li>Millennial moms are bombarded with information from the internet, but often miss out on the wisdom of the women who came before. </li>
<li>There is a belief that because motherhood is natural, it should somehow “just come naturally”. </li>
<li>The majority of available resources on the postpartum period are focused on the baby and her/his needs, developmental milestones and features - NOT the mom and her healing/recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>Finally, in the West, we tend to spend most of their time and energy during pregnancy preparing for the birth; women often find themselves unprepared at best, and blindsided at worst, when they enter into the postpartum period.<br/><br/>But there is another path to motherhood - A path where we can experience a graceful and well supported transition to motherhood. I’ve lived it and I’ve spent the last year learning about how ""Mother Centered"" cultures create healing and empowering experiences for women. <br/><br/>For the forty days after my birth as a new mother, I only had two priorities: to rest and recover, and to feed and care for my baby. We created systems so that my normal work and household responsibilities were delegated or paused. Every day, my mother-in-law made special broths, porridges, and teas with medicinal herbs and ingredients that promoted my physical recovery. I was kept warm and cocooned. I didn’t rush to “get my body back”. <br/><br/>I emerged from my Forty Day window as a new mother feeling healthier, more whole, and more energized than I had felt ever in my life. My experience was a dire contrast to many American moms' warnings of depletion and exhaustion. And yet, my experience was not unique.<br/><br/>As I researched other ""Mother Centered"" cultures in parts of Sweden and India, Malaysia and Mexico, I learned that their own healing approaches to postpartum recovery share many of the same threads as my Forty Day recovery, known in Mandarin as <i>zuo yuezi</i>. This includes eating nourishing foods, prioritizing rest, connecting with women, working with ceremony and ritual, receiving healing touch.<br/><br/>In my book, I translate traditions from other cultures into practices and systems that are accessible to you now. Whether you have a whole village of aunties ready to help or are building your own team far from family or friends, I offer guidance on the what, how, and when. <br/><br/><strong>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a new way of experiencing the initial Forty Days of your postpartum period</strong>. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for motherhood and women’s health. Ultimately, for all expecting and new mamas, I want this book to empower you to ask for help, and for your communities to step up and provide the support that you deserve. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about crucial elements for how to recover using rest and nourishment and practical ways to work with traditional practices. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>How eating to support your hormones can help you with healthy weight loss, energy balance, and breastfeeding.</li>
<li>The power of ceremony and ritual to support the transition to motherhood.</li>
<li>The healing power of self-compassion during uncertain or challenging times with a newborn baby and as a newborn mama.</li>
<li>The vastly different health and happiness outcomes that modern mamas experience when they try out simple ""Mother Centered"" practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are undergoing your own transition to motherhood or are supporting a partner through it. You will also be interested if you are contemplating becoming a mama or have friends/family who are expecting. And anyone interested in cross cultural learning will find the practices offered to be fascinating.<br/><br/><i>Mama Eats First</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to mamas (expecting or current) and all people in their support system (family, friends, as well as doulas, coaches, and medical professionals) who want to look at the recovery process and initiation into motherhood in a new way.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Book - <i>Mama Eats First</i>
</h3>
<p>At present, the book is written in six parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. In this section, you will learn about the unique challenges and opportunities facing millennial moms today. You will also learn about the groundbreaking concept of “Matresence”, the time period when a woman experiences more neurobiological changes than at any other point in her life. Through this lens, we explore how to reframe the entry point of motherhood in a way that better serves the women going through the portal. Finally, you will learn about some postpartum realities, so you’re not left scratching your head and wondering if what you’re feeling is ‘normal’. Think of this as a mother-focused version of <i>What to Expect</i>. <br/><br/><strong>Part 2 </strong>contains chapters 4-7. Do you have trouble asking for or receiving help?

</div></div>","Story of My Book
Mama Eats First is a book about the transition to motherhood and how to optimize the first forty days after birth to truly support the recovery and emergence of the newborn mom. My name is Elizabeth Schieffelin Liao and I am the author of Mama Eats First. I wrote this book because moms need more support than what our system and culture offer now. With the right tools and loving guidance, newborn moms can create an environment that allows for deep healing, recovery and a transition into a thriving, empowered experience. I was inspired to write this book because our country is in crisis. Newborn mothers are not being taken care of by the system at large, our culture, and many communities. We face many challenges including: 

Many moms hold the belief that asking for help is sign of weakness, failure or being a burden.
Shame, ""mom guilt"", and feelings of not being enough are felt by so many women. 
Abdominal pain, aches, even incontinence are considered par-for-the-course of motherhood. 
Women are being medicated at higher rates and report feeling less supported and more stressed than at any other point in history. 
The US is the only developed country with a rising maternal mortality rate.
Our culture tells new moms to “bounce back” instead of embracing and loving their new bodies. 
Millennial moms are bombarded with information from the internet, but often miss out on the wisdom of the women who came before. 
There is a belief that because motherhood is natural, it should somehow “just come naturally”. 
The majority of available resources on the postpartum period are focused on the baby and her/his needs, developmental milestones and features - NOT the mom and her healing/recovery.

Finally, in the West, we tend to spend most of their time and energy during pregnancy preparing for the birth; women often find themselves unprepared at best, and blindsided at worst, when they enter into the postpartum period.But there is another path to motherhood - A path where we can experience a graceful and well supported transition to motherhood. I’ve lived it and I’ve spent the last year learning about how ""Mother Centered"" cultures create healing and empowering experiences for women. For the forty days after my birth as a new mother, I only had two priorities: to rest and recover, and to feed and care for my baby. We created systems so that my normal work and household responsibilities were delegated or paused. Every day, my mother-in-law made special broths, porridges, and teas with medicinal herbs and ingredients that promoted my physical recovery. I was kept warm and cocooned. I didn’t rush to “get my body back”. I emerged from my Forty Day window as a new mother feeling healthier, more whole, and more energized than I had felt ever in my life. My experience was a dire contrast to many American moms' warnings of depletion and exhaustion. And yet, my experience was not unique.As I researched other ""Mother Centered"" cultures in parts of Sweden and India, Malaysia and Mexico, I learned that their own healing approaches to postpartum recovery share many of the same threads as my Forty Day recovery, known in Mandarin as zuo yuezi. This includes eating nourishing foods, prioritizing rest, connecting with women, working with ceremony and ritual, receiving healing touch.In my book, I translate traditions from other cultures into practices and systems that are accessible to you now. Whether you have a whole village of aunties ready to help or are building your own team far from family or friends, I offer guidance on the what, how, and when. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a new way of experiencing the initial Forty Days of your postpartum period. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for motherhood and women’s health. Ultimately, for all expecting and new mamas, I want this book to empower you to ask for help, and for your communities to step up and provide the support that you deserve. In this book, you'll learn about crucial elements for how to recover using rest and nourishment and practical ways to work with traditional practices. You'll hear stories such as...

How eating to support your hormones can help you with healthy weight loss, energy balance, and breastfeeding.
The power of ceremony and ritual to support the transition to motherhood.
The healing power of self-compassion during uncertain or challenging times with a newborn baby and as a newborn mama.
The vastly different health and happiness outcomes that modern mamas experience when they try out simple ""Mother Centered"" practices.

You will love this book if you are undergoing your own transition to motherhood or are supporting a partner through it. You will also be interested if you are contemplating becoming a mama or have friends/family who are expecting. And anyone interested in cross cultural learning will find the practices offered to be fascinating.Mama Eats First is a nonfiction book that speaks to mamas (expecting or current) and all people in their support system (family, friends, as well as doulas, coaches, and medical professionals) who want to look at the recovery process and initiation into motherhood in a new way.

 
The Book - Mama Eats First

At present, the book is written in six parts.Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. In this section, you will learn about the unique challenges and opportunities facing millennial moms today. You will also learn about the groundbreaking concept of “Matresence”, the time period when a woman experiences more neurobiological changes than at any other point in her life. Through this lens, we explore how to reframe the entry point of motherhood in a way that better serves the women going through the portal. Finally, you will learn about some postpartum realities, so you’re not left scratching your head and wondering if what you’re feeling is ‘normal’. Think of this as a mother-focused version of What to Expect. Part 2 contains chapters 4-7. Do you have trouble asking for or receiving help? This section will completely transform the way you think about asking for and receiving help. You will learn why behavioral psychologist Adam Grant sees receiving help as an ultimate form of giving. You will also read stories of how women with vastly different life circumstances approached building their villages. Whether you have a strong local community or feel like you’re on your own, you will discover strategies for getting the help you need. Part 3 contains chapters 8-12. Put on your comfiest robe and snuggle up as you enjoy this restorative section focused on the ultimate need of every new mom: rest! You will read about my personal struggle with being okay with slowing down, and how I hacked rest with a crying newborn (it was simple but not easy). Learn from sleep experts about feeling recharged and what to do when it simply isn’t possible to lie down.Part 4 contains chapters 13-19. This section is all about nourishment through food. Here, I take best practices from traditional ""Mother Centered"" cultures and offer them in a way that is practical for modern, millennial mamas. Have you wondered why some women ingest their own placentas? Are you hoping to avoid constipation and indigestion during your first few weeks as a mom? Learn the principles of what to eat, what to avoid, and how to avoid the common challenges that come with trying to feed yourself and your baby. Hint: Mama eats first! Part 5 contains chapters 20-23. Here, we dive deep in the social, emotional, and spiritual processing of the transition from maiden to mother. You will read stories that show how grieving is as powerful and important as celebrating. I also share insights on how the transition to parenthood can impact your partner and offer tools for protecting your relationship.Part 6 wraps up the book with chapters 24- 26. This section helps to set you up for ways of being and systems for operating long after your forty days are complete. You also will enjoy a selection of recipes inspired by ""Mother Centered"" cultures.

<p>Eliana loves to tell stories. She does this best by writing in her usual quirky, dramatic, and suspenseful manner.  Writing has been her passion from she was a young child.

<h3>What is Bookstore Day?</h3>
<p>California Bookstore Day, on <strong>Saturday May 3, 2014</strong>, is a project of the <a href=""http://www.nciba.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Northern and Southern California Independent Bookseller's Associations</a>, representing more than 300 bookstores.</p>
<p>We believe indie bookstores are an essential part of lively communities, the free-flow of ideas, and the thrill of discovery.</p>
<p>CBD will harness the creative power of authors and publishers in a giant celebration of the written word that will drive readers to brick-and-mortar bookstores. For one day, and one day only, a number of very limited-edition, unique, word-based items and books will be available in more than 100 independent stores across the state. These aren’t your run-of-the-mill signed first editions—these are literature-based art projects, unique books, and collector’s items created for this event only. </p>
<p>And California is just the first step. We hope to make Bookstore Day a national celebration of good literature and good bookstores in 2015. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where the Money Goes</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The $30,000 we are asking for will help pay for a CBD coordinator to make this all happen. It will fund the massive publicity and marketing effort needed to ensure CBD is a success for every indie bookstore in the state. </p>
<p>We have lots to do between now and May 3, 2014. We need to:</p>
<p>• Incorporate our logo into collateral materials to help brand the event</p>
<p>• Create a website</p>
<p>• Curate publisher submissions</p>
<p>• Make sure each participating bookstore is in the loop</p>
<p>• Coordinate publicity and marketing campaigns for all CA bookstores</p>
<p>• Launch and sustain and state-wide public outreach campaign</p>
<p>We assure you, no one is getting rich from this campaign. All funds raised will go directly toward making CBD work for the 300 bookstores in CA, the large and small publishers who are participating, and the millions of booklovers in the Golden State.</p>

<h2>About My Book</h2>
<p><i>The Challenge Mindset</i> is about the phenomenon of personal challenges -- why they matter and how they change our lives. It examines the anatomy of passion projects, experiments, trial runs, or learning experiences, and what they all have in common, along with the mentality it takes to design and pursue them.<br/><br/>My name is Greg Roth. I’m the author of <i>The Challenge Mindset</i> (so my name is on this book!) About three years ago, I started to notice and research challenges, as alternatives to goal-setting or habit loops or optimization. I wanted to write a different kind of personal development book. Not one that prescribes routines and mastery, but instead emphasizes risk, adventure, discovery, and self-expression.<br/><br/><i>The Challenge Mindset</i> will help you adopt a new outlook on life: a willingness to experiment, in order to break out of ruts, to learn new skills, to do something remarkable, or to give something cool to the world. This book is a mix of unlikely origin stories, unique passion projects, and recent research, and my own personal experience as someone who’s had over 100 jobs and even more interests.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about what constitutes a challenge, the four types of challenges, the five qualities of a challenge mindset, and how to put them to use in your personal and professional lives, and how they show up in the workplace among great teams and organizations. You'll hear stories like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How a copywriter with no drawing background invented a one-of-a-kind art and consulting company</li>
<li>How a scientific researcher used a challenge to change the trajectory of her career and make history</li>
<li>How a former addict invented one of the world’s most beloved eating plans</li>
<li>How companies use challenges to experiment with new processes</li>
</ul>
<p>And many other challenges that led their creators down roads and paths they never imagined. If you want inspiring stories, empowering wisdom, and practical frameworks for your own life and work, you will enjoy this book and possibly challenge a friend to read it with you.</p>
<p><i>The Challenge Mindset</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to both seasoned professionals and those just starting out in their career, looking to develop the skills to reinvent, or just invent themselves, one project at a time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Outline of The Challenge Mindset</h3>
<p>The book is written in three main parts, with a fourth section appendix of practical guides, similar to a workbook.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 : What are challenges and how do they work?</strong><br/>Contains the introduction + chapters 1-3, which examine what constitutes a challenges, why they are transformative, and how they work, practically and scientifically.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2 : The 5 qualities of a challenge mindset</strong><br/>Contains chapters 4-8, which dig deeper into each of the five qualities of a challenge mindset: curiosity, openness, immersive action, journeyism, and compassionate perspective. Each chapter is devoted to one of these qualities with interweaving stories of challenges, research, findings, and thoughtful digressions.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3: How to use challenges to pursue your personal interests, skills, and goals</strong><br/>Contains chapters 9-12, which provide guides and frameworks for designing personal challenges, the difference between adaptability and optimization, and advice for teams and organizations, plus an epilogue.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm liz yerby, a queer cartoonist living in Portland, OR.  In 2015-2016, I spent an hour or two making comics every day.  I ended up writing about an intense romantic relationship, a series of travels, struggling with depression and anxiety and the slow process of coming out as queer.   By contributing to this campaign, you can not only the pre-order the book, but also help me print copies for fall comics and zine festivals, and help support me in my other art endeavors!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need money to print a book and have enough copies for festivals!  Because I'm a nervous person and made this book with dying pens, I thought it would be easier to self-publish rather than to find a publisher.  I've decided to produce my book with create-space, which is very simple.  The book is all laid out and ready to print.<br/><br/>Also, if I am able to print enough books and make more profit, by helping contribute to this indiegogo, you can help me just feel more financially stable!   As a working artist, I'm exhausted!  Currently, I'm working a low-wage job 24-35 hours a week, and spending most of my non day-job days work on comics and art projects.  These projects include among other things: writing new comics, making pieces for art shows, applying for grants, helping run a friend anthology with my comics collective the Sound Grounds Wreckin' Cru, and helping organize the Portland Zine Symposium.  Both saying you like my comics and donating money to this campaign would mean a lot in terms of helping me stay on track!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Graphic Novels which are compilations of daily comics are a somewhat novel and nice format.<br/>I've made a wide variety of books myself with the aid of copiers, staplers, a bindfast, and industrial book cutters which are available at the IPRC.  Throughout that process, I've crafted my skills using InDesign to layout books, and also worked on my writing and drawing skills.  I've sold over a hundred copies of a few of my zines!<br/><br/>I'm very excited to be able to share this project with people as a large, cohesive book and not just as images on the internet.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges<br/> </h3>
<p>I have scheduled out time for the next few months to do art, and that will include sending out indiegogo orders and doing any drawings for people who ask for them.  I am hoping to have it done by mid-november, with plenty of time for these to be out to people for christmas. *ahem* buy your friends a comic book for Christmas.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't financially help, why not share my campaign? <br/>thanks, friends!</p>

I have scheduled out time for the next few months to do art, and that will include sending out indiegogo orders and doing any drawings for people who ask for them.  I am hoping to have it done by mid-november, with plenty of time for these to be out to people for christmas. *ahem* buy your friends a comic book for Christmas.

<h3 style=""text-align: right;"">La Novela</h3>
<p>En México la hemorragia imparable provocada por el crimen y la impunidad muestra que esas fuerzas perversas convirtieron este país en un Estado fallido, un Estado Mafioso. Así, la mayoría de los estados de la República cayeron en manos de lo ilegítimo, de cuerpos criminales y rapaces donde no faltará la firma de políticos y empresarios promotores de un capitalismo destructor. Por eso, no sorprende que este país esté lejos de una democracia efectiva. Más bien es, a todas luces, una mafiocracia. Y esta realidad caótica y sangrienta —añádanse las constantes amenazas de Estados Unidos, el Sheriff  del Mundo— ha golpeado despiadadamente a la sociedad mexicana; ella ha sido presa de esa espiral destructiva, a tal punto de flagelarla demencialmente. Pero una legión heroica no ha callado, se niega al silencio. Son ellos, los periodistas —el Cuarto Poder— decididos a luchar contra las bestias del subsuelo; ellos, la voz de la tribu, de la esperanza. Por desgracia, desde el año 2000 más de 140 periodistas mexicanos han perdido la vida y muchos más han sido heridos, amenazados o expulsados de sus ciudades y pueblos. Aun así, las autoridades dicen que los mexicanos vivimos en un Estado de derecho —cuando en los dos últimos sexenios más de 250 mil personas fueron asesinadas y cerca de 50 mil se encuentran desaparecidas—, uno donde el Ejército se encuentra en las calles realizando el trabajo de las policías corruptas y enfrentándose a los fuera de la ley (con las esperadas bajas colaterales entre la población).<br/>            Vivir aquí, pues, en una de las regiones del espanto, me llevó a escribir esta novela cuya historia ocurre en Tijuana, una de las ciudades más peligrosas de la Tierra (en 2018 más de 2500 personas fueron ejecutadas). El lector de este libro tendrá la oportunidad de adentrarse en un mundo ácido, en una urbe marcada por la perversidad de un millonario explotador, un asesino cuyo discurso trabaja para el ultraje y la humillación. O bien será testigo de un periodista de origen humilde que escribe para oponerse a la destrucción de una comunidad; escribe en las páginas de un periódico —y al lado de su guía, hombre de izquierda vociferante y explosivo pero listo para agarrarse a golpes contra los enemigos de los justos— para defender, aguerridamente, a las víctimas del transgresor de la ley. Y el texto dará cabida a un profesor que, imantado por la figura y verbo de Don Quijote —luz imparable, aún cautivante—, decide recorrer la ciudad para dar una batalla justa por quien ya no está en ella debido a su gran pecado: trabajar, intensamente, con su pluma para el bienestar de la comuna. También en esta novela será convocado el quijotesco Che Guevara quien, en otra dimensión y otro tiempo, pisó los caminos ensangrentados de la América Latina cargando dolor e ira. Pero asimismo un sentimiento de piedad que, como una estrella imbatible, sigue vibrando en el firmamento de la noche latinoamericana.<br/>            Bienvenido lector a <i>La batalla por el ausente</i>.</p>

<p>Story of My Book</p>
<p>Get With The Program discusses why computer science education opportunities need to be available in every school and the difficulties that come about when trying to get these classes into the classroom.<br/><br/>My name is Mary and I am the author of Get With The Program. I wrote this book because schools across the nation are in a dire need for computer science education opportunities from qualified teachers.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the importance and the power of providing computer science education at all stages of learning. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for computer science education in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you integrate more computer science opportunities within your community.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about diversity in the technology space and it's relation with education and the struggle of attaining teachers for computer science:</p>
<p>The technology field severely lacks diversity which means that implicit biases are being coded into technologies we use every day.</p>
<p>Teachers looking to teach advanced computer science courses must pass a licensing exam which has been compared to taking 3-4 college computer science courses, making it difficult for teachers to earn.</p>
<p>Computer science education relies heavily on funding, meaning that computer science education opportunities are primarily in wealthy areas that can afford licensed teachers and the computers needed for the course, thus continuing the lack of diversity in the technology field.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you have any interest in technology, education, or both.<br/><br/>Get With The Program is a non-fiction book that speaks to education professionals and parents who are looking at computer science opportunities in their own schools and communities for the first time.</p>
<p>The Book - Get With The Program</p>
<p>The book is written in 4 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. Part 1 dives into the issues behind computer science education and what makes this subject so difficult to bring into the classroom. In these chapters I will talk about accessibility to computer science education and how it correlates with educational equity and the achievement gap. Furthermore, we will go over what a technology course is about and how it is currently being misunderstood.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 4 - 6. In this part, we will discuss the role of teachers in the technology space. Teaching computer science is not an easy feat, especially when the subject matter changes every 5 - 10 years considering the speed modern technology is changing. This part focuses on bringing teachers into the computer science space to give our students the best computer science experience.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 7 - 9. These chapters will talk specifically on how to implement computer science education into schools. Whether that be introducing a new course or integrating computer science skills into a math lesson, computer science education can (and should) fit into the daily curriculum of all students.<br/><br/>Part 4 contains Chapters 10 - 11. The final chapters in the book will be my suggestions on possible solutions to bringing about more computer science opportunities and making it more accessible for all communities. Additionally, I will talk about the power of technology and where I see the field going.<br/> </p>
<p>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</p>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<p>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2020</p>
<p>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</p>
<p>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Audiobook)</p>
<p>The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</p>
<p>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this spring</p>
<p><br/>When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will donate the additional profits to fund scholarships for teacher workshops in support of expanding computer science education.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</p>
<p>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish</p>
<p>A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book</p>
<p>Your Name will appear in a Special, Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)</p>
<p>Early access to the Introduction of my Book and my entire manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback</p>
<p>The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover</p>
<p>I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share experience the experiences of writing my book</p>

<p>About the Author</p>
<p>Mary Newby is an IT Design Analyst for Harley-Davidson, as well as the President of her Alma Mater’s Young Alumni Association and a teacher’s assistant for a Introduction to Computer Science class at a local high school.<br/><br/>Mary has been volunteering for local schools as a teacher’s assistant for computer science classes for two years now. Without the help of herself and volunteers like her, many schools in her area would not have a computer science program. She loves her technology career and wants more young people exposed to the opportunities, growth, and creativity that accompany a job in the field. Unfortunately, many schools do not have a comprehensive computer science program, leaving many students without the chance to explore the subject. Mary is looking for answers as to why computer science education opportunities are so scarce when technology is everywhere!<br/><br/>In her very little free time, Mary spends most of it at home with her cats (cat lady alert!), either reading, cooking, or crafting. She is the fourth of five girls in her family who all reside in the Midwest and is the proud aunt of 6 nieces and nephews, who she hopes will positively benefit from the work she is doing promoting computer science education.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Mary at marycnewby@gmail.com and on LinkedIn.</p>

<h3><strong>What is this page all about?  What is crowdfunding?  </strong></h3>
<p><em>Crowdfunding is a term that describes the collective effort of individuals who network and pool their money, usually via the Internet, to support efforts initiated by other people or organizations like disaster relief, political campaigns, and support for struggling artists and businesses. Indiegogo, a proven platform that has also collaborated with Barack Obama and JOBS Act, is hosting our campaign through April 13th.  We thank them for making this platform available.<strong><br/></strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Our objective over the next 60 days is to raise $6000 from your generous contributions made to help buoy our business, which is poised on the cusp of success.<br/></strong></p>
<p>Over the last two years, we have accomplished a great deal here at KLG Press. We've <strong>written and published</strong> thirty books. We have a rock-bed belief that we can produce much more. We have committed to this company for the benefit of ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren. Ebooks are forever. No more do books have to appear on bookstore shelves for six months then disappear to dusty back store shelves in used bookstores. Ebooks stay green, stay visible, stay selling for as long as the files are maintained. </p>
<p>With your willingness to talk to friends and families about our campaign and your support, we can take that next growth step for our business.<strong>  </strong>We can better connect with our readers and provide entertaining, helpful reads while staying rooted in our families and providing for their futures. Our goal is to hit one hundred books published in early 2014. <strong>Watch us!</strong> Better still, <strong>invest in us.</strong> We’d truly appreciate your support.</p>
<h3><strong>What will this IndieGoGo campaign pay for?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1. Upgrading our computer/technology equipment </strong></p>
<p>Ever had one of those days where your printer took a thirty-minute coffee break in the middle of printing a document? Ever had your computer freeze in the midst of formatting a complicated file? Ever had your computer blue screen and lose a manuscript with thousands of words?</p>
<p>We have. <em>A lot.</em></p>
<p>When we started this business, we had computer equipment that was commensurate with single writers pursuing singular goals. Now that we’ve branched into publishing and production of high-resolution graphics, our computer equipment is stressed and no longer doing the job without Band-Aids, jury-rigging, and swearing. Our new associate, John, doesn’t currently have a working computer at all. <em>No bueno!</em> In addition, in order to expand into the enormous Apple market without a distributor, we must add a Mac to our current PC arrangement.</p>
<p>And since some of our best-selling titles include cookbooks, we need a new digital camera to produce food images. The included digital capabilities of the cameras we have priced would also allow us to produce higher quality movies than in the past.</p>
<p>Producing our future books with new equipment would transform the production process by ensuring lost data is a thing of the past, making uploads to all our markets faster and smoother, and speeding up the transformation of KLG Press into a more competitive publisher in the global book marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>2. Enhanced marketing work</strong></p>
<p>Our marketing efforts, to-date, have resulted in a total of 50,000 downloads of our 30 titles. (That number includes both paid purchases and numerous freebie giveaway offers.) That may sound like alot.  Unfortunately, it is not.  We have only had the time to do the bare minimum, on a skimpy budget. Engaging marketing campaigns per book take copious amounts of time and dollars to develop.  Funding in our marketing endeavors includes paying for advertising and book marketing companies to promote our work.  It would also pay John a minimal part-time salary to continue developing our social media presence.</p>
<h3><strong>Upcoming Marketing and Production Schedule</strong></h3>
<p>These are just a few of the books we're planning on either producing or promoting in the next year.  Your support in making this happen is truly appreciated.  <em><br/></em></p>

<p>As co-owners of Know Link Grow LLC and KLG Press, we’ve worked hard over the last two years to learn the intricacies of this business – from graphics to book production, from campaign launches to marketing. We do all the work ourselves: web design; book cover development; blog posts; fiction writing; and social media management. That’s us! The modern-day Jills-of-All-Trades. We’ve put in thousands of hours unpaid time. We’ve written hundreds of thousands of words, and produced uncounted quality graphics. We’ve thought and rethought our business objectives as the ebook market exploded with multiple opportunities. Now we’re looking to expand our market reach to additional booksellers and libraries here in the United States, as well as digital access across the globe.</p>
<p>As much as we would love to have that one bestseller that would catapult us into the spotlight, we are realistic about steady growth of our inventory and royalties. This company has been a place where we have respected our talents as writers and have worked hard to produce and publish quality words, books, and products. To that end, we’ve reached the point of needing outside funding for our company to reach the next level. And that’s where you come in!

</center></div>","Thank you so much for visiting our page!  We appreciate your interest.
What is this page all about?  What is crowdfunding?  
Crowdfunding is a term that describes the collective effort of individuals who network and pool their money, usually via the Internet, to support efforts initiated by other people or organizations like disaster relief, political campaigns, and support for struggling artists and businesses. Indiegogo, a proven platform that has also collaborated with Barack Obama and JOBS Act, is hosting our campaign through April 13th.  We thank them for making this platform available.
Our objective over the next 60 days is to raise $6000 from your generous contributions made to help buoy our business, which is poised on the cusp of success.
Over the last two years, we have accomplished a great deal here at KLG Press. We've written and published thirty books. We have a rock-bed belief that we can produce much more. We have committed to this company for the benefit of ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren. Ebooks are forever. No more do books have to appear on bookstore shelves for six months then disappear to dusty back store shelves in used bookstores. Ebooks stay green, stay visible, stay selling for as long as the files are maintained. 
With your willingness to talk to friends and families about our campaign and your support, we can take that next growth step for our business.  We can better connect with our readers and provide entertaining, helpful reads while staying rooted in our families and providing for their futures. Our goal is to hit one hundred books published in early 2014. Watch us! Better still, invest in us. We’d truly appreciate your support.
What will this IndieGoGo campaign pay for?
1. Upgrading our computer/technology equipment 
Ever had one of those days where your printer took a thirty-minute coffee break in the middle of printing a document? Ever had your computer freeze in the midst of formatting a complicated file? Ever had your computer blue screen and lose a manuscript with thousands of words?
We have. A lot.
When we started this business, we had computer equipment that was commensurate with single writers pursuing singular goals. Now that we’ve branched into publishing and production of high-resolution graphics, our computer equipment is stressed and no longer doing the job without Band-Aids, jury-rigging, and swearing. Our new associate, John, doesn’t currently have a working computer at all. No bueno! In addition, in order to expand into the enormous Apple market without a distributor, we must add a Mac to our current PC arrangement.
And since some of our best-selling titles include cookbooks, we need a new digital camera to produce food images. The included digital capabilities of the cameras we have priced would also allow us to produce higher quality movies than in the past.
Producing our future books with new equipment would transform the production process by ensuring lost data is a thing of the past, making uploads to all our markets faster and smoother, and speeding up the transformation of KLG Press into a more competitive publisher in the global book marketplace.
2. Enhanced marketing work
Our marketing efforts, to-date, have resulted in a total of 50,000 downloads of our 30 titles. (That number includes both paid purchases and numerous freebie giveaway offers.) That may sound like alot.  Unfortunately, it is not.  We have only had the time to do the bare minimum, on a skimpy budget. Engaging marketing campaigns per book take copious amounts of time and dollars to develop.  Funding in our marketing endeavors includes paying for advertising and book marketing companies to promote our work.  It would also pay John a minimal part-time salary to continue developing our social media presence.

<h3>My Book -- and Mission!<br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Be one of the first who can say you helped get my book, <i style="""">Data Dynamite: liberate information to transform our world</i>, into
distribution!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It's the indispensable guide to an exciting and
creative crusade: to liberate data so that it
can improve our lives, and, as the title says, transform our world. Dubious? No matter how important it is,
data can’t have that kind of power, can it?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Yes it can! The reason we don’t realize it is that we haven’t
had access to that data: policies and technical obstacles kept you and me from
access to data. That’s even though our birth records, education, jobs, purchases and
other aspects of our lives have been the stuff of that data.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Today, data can be shared instantly, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">as it is gathered</span>. <span style=""""> </span>However, too many government agencies
and businesses still act as if the old rules of data scarcity were still in
effect. Far too much data is also trapped in documents rather than easily
extracted and usable elsewhere.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Data Dynamite</span> will show that when data <span style=""""> </span><i style="""">is</i>
made available to all <span style=""""></span>who need it and on
a real-time basis, that data is transformed into valuable <span style=""font-style: italic;"">information</span>. Just think how the US
government’s decision in 2000 to give free access to Global Positioning System
data started a global industry of location-based services that not only is
creating billions of dollars of wealth, but also has transformed our lives!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Data Dynamite</span>
tells how a small combination of proven tools let us “tag” data with
information that is permanently attached to it, then lets it be transmitted <i style="""">instantly</i> wherever we insert those same
tags.<span style="""">  </span></p>
</div><div>
<h4>The Impact</h4>
<p>The results of liberating data?<span style="""">  </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""""></span></span>Companies can streamline their supply chains, make
better internal decisions by giving all employees the information they need, and even involve the public in finding creative new
ways to profit from their data.</li>
<li>Government can be leaner, cut regulatory burdens
on businesses, and yet actually do a better job
protecting us. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""""></span></span>You and I can take charge of our health care by sharing data
that we generate ourselves using smartphones and other devices, reduce our environmental impacts,
and simplify our lives.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Yes, free, real-time data really is “dynamite,” just waiting for
us to show the vision and determination to make it available. Perhaps the most important argument that we need to liberate data now is
made by an expert who says that if one of these systems had been in
effect in the mortgage industry during the last decade bad mortgages
wouldn't have been written and the whole global financial meltdown
would have been avoided! When we do share data, it will blow away our old sense of limits and create a new reality of
unprecedented opportunity. ""Network Effects"" will kick in: the more businesses, agencies and individuals participate, the more each will benefit! Join me on the path toward transformation!</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""MsoNormal"">A Little About Me!</h3>
<br/>Writing this book, and becoming involved in the effort to liberate data is the most exciting thing I've done in a lifetime spent on the cutting edge of change.<br/><p class=""MsoNormal""> I’ve had an eclectic career: day care teacher, TV writer,
gubernatorial (Mike Dukakis) press secretary, corporate crisis consultant,
environmental strategist, and, currently, homeland security and disaster
consultant.<span style="""">  </span>The common thread in
my work has been communication – I have a journalism degree and have
always loved to explain complex subjects in a way that anyone can understand
them.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">When it comes to liberating data, I believe the holistic
way in which I tend to approach issues means that I’ve created the most
comprehensive, and integrated approach to data so far. It’s one that puts data
at the core of everything we do, which in turn creates limitless ways to use
that data creatively and streamline and unify our lives and work as never before.
Glad you’re along for the ride!</p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need -- and What You Get</h3>
<h4>The Budget</h4>
<p>A key aspect of liberating data is transparency, and since I try to always walk my talk, the spending for ""Data Dynamite"" will be fully documented here.</p>
<p> I didn't plan on self-publishing, but some significant events led me to it. Vivek Kundra, the first U.S.CIO was to be my co-author, but couldn't continue after he took his new job. O'Reilly was going to publish it.  I've been told (can't confirm it) that the reason why I got a contract so quickly was that Google's Eric Schmidt somehow heard about it and urged Tim O'Reilly to print it. Eventually we parted company (on friendly terms!): as you'd expect, O'Reilly wanted a book more like its how-to books, while I wanted a more evangelistic tone.</p>
<p>But that's all ancient history.  </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The biggest downside of self-publishing is paying for the
costs such as editing and graphic design that the publisher normally picks up. The budget I've prepared for the final stages of the book publishing process totals $14,000:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>$5,000 partial living expenses for two months.</p></li>
<li><p>$4,500 graphic arts, design services (including $1,200 for cover)</p></li>
<li><p>$1,500 editing</p></li>
<li><p>$2,500 printing (200 copies for promotion and marketing)</p></li>
<li><p>$500 for 1000 postcards and mailing for promotion.</p></li>
<li>Indiegogo processing fees<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Why am I asking for help?  I’ve really sacrificed my consulting work in the past two years to
work on this book, so I simply don’t have the resources to pay these expenses
right now. In fact, my wife’s salary plus what I bring in isn’t enough to cover
our “nut” right now! <br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The hardest part of the budget to ask for is $5000 that would give me $3500 in partial

I hope you'll join me in this crusade!<br/></p>
</div></div>","My Book -- and Mission!



Be one of the first who can say you helped get my book, Data Dynamite: liberate information to transform our world, into
distribution!
It's the indispensable guide to an exciting and
creative crusade: to liberate data so that it
can improve our lives, and, as the title says, transform our world. Dubious? No matter how important it is,
data can’t have that kind of power, can it?
Yes it can! The reason we don’t realize it is that we haven’t
had access to that data: policies and technical obstacles kept you and me from
access to data. That’s even though our birth records, education, jobs, purchases and
other aspects of our lives have been the stuff of that data.
Today, data can be shared instantly, as it is gathered.  However, too many government agencies
and businesses still act as if the old rules of data scarcity were still in
effect. Far too much data is also trapped in documents rather than easily
extracted and usable elsewhere.
Data Dynamite will show that when data  is
made available to all who need it and on
a real-time basis, that data is transformed into valuable information. Just think how the US
government’s decision in 2000 to give free access to Global Positioning System
data started a global industry of location-based services that not only is
creating billions of dollars of wealth, but also has transformed our lives!
 Data Dynamite
tells how a small combination of proven tools let us “tag” data with
information that is permanently attached to it, then lets it be transmitted instantly wherever we insert those same
tags.  

The Impact
The results of liberating data?  


Companies can streamline their supply chains, make
better internal decisions by giving all employees the information they need, and even involve the public in finding creative new
ways to profit from their data.
Government can be leaner, cut regulatory burdens
on businesses, and yet actually do a better job
protecting us. 


You and I can take charge of our health care by sharing data
that we generate ourselves using smartphones and other devices, reduce our environmental impacts,
and simplify our lives.

Yes, free, real-time data really is “dynamite,” just waiting for
us to show the vision and determination to make it available. Perhaps the most important argument that we need to liberate data now is
made by an expert who says that if one of these systems had been in
effect in the mortgage industry during the last decade bad mortgages
wouldn't have been written and the whole global financial meltdown
would have been avoided! When we do share data, it will blow away our old sense of limits and create a new reality of
unprecedented opportunity. ""Network Effects"" will kick in: the more businesses, agencies and individuals participate, the more each will benefit! Join me on the path toward transformation!


More Detail

The book has eight chapters:


 An introduction to the concept of structured
data and why we need to liberate data now (whether or not you contribute to the project, please download this chapter, which also gives an overview of the entire book).


A chapter each on the simple technology behind the
concept and neat new tools to capitalize on it

A
chapter about the Office of the Chief Technology Officer of the District of
Columbia while Vivek Kundra ran it – because DC “OCTO” is the best example I
know of to date illustrating all aspects of the “data-centric organization.""

 A chapter each on how data liberation will
affect business, government, and our personal lives

A conclusion that ends with a liberating data
manifesto to motivate readers to become involved in efforts to make data
liberation and the data-centric organization a reality.   


A Little About Me!
Writing this book, and becoming involved in the effort to liberate data is the most exciting thing I've done in a lifetime spent on the cutting edge of change. I’ve had an eclectic career: day care teacher, TV writer,
gubernatorial (Mike Dukakis) press secretary, corporate crisis consultant,
environmental strategist, and, currently, homeland security and disaster
consultant.  The common thread in
my work has been communication – I have a journalism degree and have
always loved to explain complex subjects in a way that anyone can understand
them.
When it comes to liberating data, I believe the holistic
way in which I tend to approach issues means that I’ve created the most
comprehensive, and integrated approach to data so far. It’s one that puts data
at the core of everything we do, which in turn creates limitless ways to use
that data creatively and streamline and unify our lives and work as never before.
Glad you’re along for the ride!


What I Need -- and What You Get
The Budget
A key aspect of liberating data is transparency, and since I try to always walk my talk, the spending for ""Data Dynamite"" will be fully documented here.
 I didn't plan on self-publishing, but some significant events led me to it. Vivek Kundra, the first U.S.CIO was to be my co-author, but couldn't continue after he took his new job. O'Reilly was going to publish it.  I've been told (can't confirm it) that the reason why I got a contract so quickly was that Google's Eric Schmidt somehow heard about it and urged Tim O'Reilly to print it. Eventually we parted company (on friendly terms!): as you'd expect, O'Reilly wanted a book more like its how-to books, while I wanted a more evangelistic tone.
But that's all ancient history.  
The biggest downside of self-publishing is paying for the
costs such as editing and graphic design that the publisher normally picks up. The budget I've prepared for the final stages of the book publishing process totals $14,000:

$5,000 partial living expenses for two months.
$4,500 graphic arts, design services (including $1,200 for cover)
$1,500 editing
$2,500 printing (200 copies for promotion and marketing)
$500 for 1000 postcards and mailing for promotion.
Indiegogo processing fees


Why am I asking for help?  I’ve really sacrificed my consulting work in the past two years to
work on this book, so I simply don’t have the resources to pay these expenses
right now. In fact, my wife’s salary plus what I bring in isn’t enough to cover
our “nut” right now! 
The hardest part of the budget to ask for is $5000 that would give me $3500 in partial
living expenses for the next two months. However, I believe that is vital because it would allow me to focus on completing the
project instead of worrying about how to pay the bills. 
Graphic arts services to design both the e-book and print
versions of the book, as well as typography, will run $3,300, plus $1200 for
cover design (I hope to get permission from Chris
Jordan for one of his stunning and compelling infographics – you owe it to
yourself to check them out!)  I'll use SoroDesign,
a first-class design firm specializing in e-books. 
Editing would cost about $1,500. 
I had toyed with the idea of not producing a paper edition
at all, since an all-electronic approach would allow much more frequent
revisions and more use of illustrations, a must given the visual component of
this approach. However, I did decide that print-on-demand technology would make
it worthwhile, and decided to go with Lightning Source,
highly recommended by SoroDesign.  My plan is to pre-print 200 copies for use in promotion and marketing, which would cost $2500. Copies for sale would be handled on a print-on-demand basis. 
Finally, even though most of the marketing for the book
would be done through social media, the budget includes $500 for printing and postage to
distribute 1,000 illustrated postcards about the book.
 Overall, the budget I’ve created totals $14,000. I think that will allow an attractive
and well-edited book while still keeping the overall costs to a bare minimum. If I don't get enough of the goal to be able to produce the book, all contributions will be refunded upon request of the donor.
What You'll get!


The first 50 people to donate to the project, no matter what the amount, will get a draft copy within the next three weeks, soliciting their comments as part of the editing process! 


If you give $15 you'll get an advance copy of the digital version of Data Dynamite, delivered a week before the public release date.
If you give $28.00 ($24.99 plus $3 shipping & handling) you'll get an autographed advance copy of the paper version of Data Dynamite, delivered a week before the public release date.   
If you give $100 you will get an autographed advance copy of the paper edition plus acknowledgment in the book of your status as a patron.
If you give $250 you will get an autographed advance copy of the paper edition, acknowledgment in the book as a patron, and one hour of phone consultation with me on how to begin your organization's transition to a data-centric one.
if you give $500 you will get an autographed advance copy of the paper edition, acknowledgment in the book as a patron, and two hours of phone consultation with me on how to begin your organization's transition to a data-centric one.

<h3>I Want My Daddy To Do It- a children's book about the strong bond between a father and son<br/>
</h3>
<p>When <b>Braylon Prestbury</b> was two years old, his favorite phrase was ""I want my daddy to do it.""

<p><i>I Want My Daddy To Do It</i> <i>!</i> is written to entertain and delight young children, and to encourage other fathers to either build or strengthen the bond they have with their child(ren). No matter who else was around, be it <b>Braylon's</b> mother, grandmother, or anyone else, he always wanted me to help him achieve whatever it was he set out to achieve.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><em>Hannah cradled the newborn in one arm and looked down at the iron skillet in her hand, at the droplet of red dangling from the bottom, about to fall. It broke free, and her eyes followed it to the floor, saw it splash onto the linoleum tile. That bright spatter brought her back to her senses, and suddenly she became aware of the infant screaming as only brand new babies can, of the blood on her face, neck and hands, already turning sticky as it dried, and of her mother. Their mother, lying on the floor with her skull caved in.</em></p>
<p><em>She gripped the skillet. “Shhh,” she said absently to the baby. She waited.</em></p>
<p><em>Her mother didn’t get up again.</em></p>
<p><em>Hannah breathed a sigh of relief, then sucked it back in sharply as the grief of what she’d done hit her like a swift kick to the gut. She dropped the skillet and spun toward the sink. Her last meal hit the drain as the skillet hit the floor. She stayed bent over the sink for a long time, retching even after her stomach had given up everything it had to give. Finally, she rinsed her mouth out, then grabbed a rag and wet it down before shutting off the water. </em></p>
<p><em>She slid to the floor, still hugging the baby to her chest. Dried blood and fluid from the birth still coated him, and he’d gotten more of their mother’s blood on him during the fight. Hannah hummed an absent-minded lullaby as she wiped him down. Then she tossed the bloody rag in the sink and leaned over to pull a fresh towel from a nearby basket. She swaddled the baby and held him tight, and for the first time since taking his first breath, he stopped crying.</em></p>
<p><em>“Noah,” Hannah whispered, tears burning her eyes and the back of her throat as she cradled her newborn brother. “They wanted to name you Noah.” </em></p>
<p><em>She lifted her gaze from the baby to her mother’s disfigured corpse, and her cries took over for the baby’s. She didn’t know what to do next. She wasn’t sure what was happening. And she didn’t understand how the whole world had gone to utter hell before the day had even begun.</em></p>
<p><em><br/></em>This is how the end of the world begins for Hannah Jordan, who emerges from hiding in her family's back yard bomb shelter months after the dead began to walk, only to find a world ruled by vampires who have hearded what's left of humanity into vampire-controlled refugee camps.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<h3><i>The Tarian Diets</i></h3>
<p>My book will discuss the different impacts food has on the world both inside you and the world around you. You will be able to choose a Tarian diet that fits your life. (The suffix “arian” means a person who practices or believes something. Tarian is a word that I made up to easily refer to all the types of diets!)<br/><br/>My name is Jady Chen and I am the author of The <i>Tarian Diets</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to clear up the misunderstandings for people who don’t eat meat, give reasons why you may want to switch to a vegetarian/vegan diet, but also show you that it’s okay to cheat on your “diet.”<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that food really does play a huge role in our everyday lives. I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for eating, cooking, and sharing food in you. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you figure out what kind of diet and lifestyle works best for you and how it’s a lot easier than you think.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about sustainability, health, and animal ethics from both experts and novices in their fields:</p>
<p>Carbs in the air, carbs in your body — the correlation between what you eat and climate change — with Dr. Richard Plate, an empathetic professor that studies the three pillars of sustainability and the impact we as humans have on our world. </p>
<p>Give me dairy-free or give me death — our bodies are made differently so no one meal plan is healthy for everyone — with Jamie Joyce, an aspiring and powerful woman who nearly died until she embraced a diet that even her doctor didn't consider. </p>
<p>Loving the animals you eat — understanding cognitive dissonance and why it’s both okay and not okay for animals to be killed for food — with Lee Perry, a compassionate activist that not only advocates for the lives of animals but also for the people that may not know their stories. </p>You will love this book if you’ve tried to go plant-based and found it too annoying or difficult to deal with.<br/><i>The Tarian Diets</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to meat-eaters and vegans alike who are looking at a world that is no longer mutually-exclusive for the first time.<h2> </h2>

<h2>About the Author</h2> <strong>Jady Chen</strong> is a researcher at heart and loves analyzing all sides to a story. She views diversity and differences as strengths rather than weaknesses. Jady attended the University of Central Florida, a hub for acceptance and a champion of individual differences. She always believes that in order to make global changes, one has to act locally. She works with sustainability projects in her own city to promote environmentally and humanistically responsible behavior.<br/><br/>Jady wrote this book because she also went through all different kinds of diets before she found the one that was the healthiest for her. Jady was tired of all the stereotypes that being vegan or vegetarian had so she wanted to combat these misunderstandings. Jady wants to help others find a diet, and essentially lifestyle, that makes them feel healthy in all aspects — from mental health to physiological health and environmental health.<br/><br/>In the free time that she manages to salvage, Jady likes to be a crazy cat lady and spend time with her four cats. Her friends describe her as dorky and super awkward. Jady will find any way to inject a dad-joke into a conversation. She can also eat a lot more than she looks like she can and often surprises people when she asks for a third helping.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Jady at simplejady@gmail.com and on Facebook (Jady Chen) and Instagram (@simplejady)<p> </p>

<h2>Story of the book</h2>
<p>Money Chasing Behavior: Rethinking Economics is a book that brings a new theory of economics to public attention; a theory contending that we humans have made a catastrophic mistake in logic when creating our economic systems. The economy and the amount of wealth we produce comes down to our decision-making systems, and unbeknownst to us, we have inadvertently selected a system that makes us far worse off than we could be otherwise. The amount of unrealized and untapped wealth potential is orders of magnitude greater than what we have now, and it hides in plain sight waiting for us to access it. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what this logical mistake is, why it exists unnoticed, how we could correct it, and ultimately, see how much better the world can be when we make optimal decisions.<br/><br/>In the book, we will break concepts down into small, easy to digest logical bits and connect them to reveal some earth-shattering facts about our current economic systems. Some of the most intriguing topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How our current currency and financial systems force poor decision-making through a broken supply &amp; demand structure</li>
<li>Why our money needs an expiration date to account for time</li>
<li>How progressive tax systems ensure that many people cannot afford their own labor</li>
<li>How to make capitalistic success indistinguishable from philanthropy</li>
<li>Why we should want our currency to deflate over time</li>
<li>How we could increase standards of living tenfold in a matter of years</li>
<li>And much more...</li>
</ul>
</div><p>This new economic theory contends that we have never properly understood the relationship between reality, our actions, and wealth creation. While some of our preexisting beliefs can make the subject matter difficult, this book is for everyone. Economists and laypeople alike, we are all relearning the fundamentals of our reality and the economy. Any curious reader looking to expand their understanding of reality should pick up a copy and prepare to see the world from a completely new perspective.</p><h2>The Book - Money Chasing Behavior: Rethinking Economics</h2><p>The book is broken into three parts for an easy understanding of what we are doing wrong and why, how we would correct our mistakes, and in-depth topic discussions in a question and answer format.<br/><br/>Part I contains the Introduction + Chapters 1 - 7.</p><ul><li>This part focuses on identifying the fundamentals of wealth creation, the economy, and where our current systems go wrong. We will cover how this logical mistake first arose, how adding currency complicates the problem further, how taxes fit into the picture, why long-held beliefs about markets are wrong and harmful, and much more.</li></ul><p>Part II contains Chapters 8 - 12.</p><ul><li>Moving on from the fundamentals covered in Part I, this part is all about policy logic; meaning, given what we know, what types of policies will new systems logically require. Leaving politics out of the conversation, we will cover policies for currencies and the environment, the roles of public and private-sector production, taxes, automation, and the roles of loans, debt, and investment.</li></ul><p>Part III contains extrapolations on some of the more difficult subjects in a question &amp; answer format.</p><ul>
<li>How do youth and non-working individuals fit into the system? How does this system work with international trade? What would this system yield in terms of quality of life? And much more.</li>
<li>I have left some room to answer your questions in the book. After a few lectures, I will post on here and Twitter when we are accepting your questions.</li>
</ul><h2>How to Support</h2><p>The goal in publishing this book is to promote understanding and discourse around how we structure our lives within economic systems, and every mind changed is a step in the right direction. There are many ways of supporting this goal, both socially and monetarily.</p><h3>Financial Support</h3><p>For those in a position to contribute financially, there are publishing costs that the campaign must cover before launch. Publishing with New Degree Press allows us to keep the fundraising goals to a minimum, and if you are able to support the cause with your wallet, please help get us across the finish line. Money raised will go towards the following:</p><ul>
<li>The Editor Staff - assisting in revisions and publishing the manuscript in December 2020.</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats).</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to make help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this winter.</li>
<li>The Illustrations - bringing in quality visuals to help make complex topics easier. </li>
<li>When we reach 120 pre-sale copies of the book, we will go forward with publishing. When we reach 200 pre-sale copies, we will also publish a hardcover edition. </li>
</ul><p>There are pre-order tiers (on the right of your screen) to help cover these publishing costs, and for those able to contribute financially, we are offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order the book within the campaign window:</p><ul>
<li>A personally signed copy of my book when I publish</li>
<li>Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book</li>
<li>Your Name will appear in a Special, Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)</li>
<li>Early access to the book’s Introduction and some additional sections of the manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback</li>
<li>The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting the book’s cover</li>
<li>And updates on newly released articles and lectures that accompany the book</li>
</ul><p>Any funding that exceeds the campaign’s goal will go toward additional promotion and research initiatives.</p><h3>Social Support and Free Content</h3><p>As the theory points out, money is just a tool, and there are many ways that anyone can support for free. Between the campaign launch and the release date, I will be releasing free content that follows the structure of the book in the form of articles and video lectures. Viewing and sharing the content is the easiest and cheapest way to contribute, specifically:</p><ul>
<li>Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign, videos, and articles on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family, and network. Please use #MoneyChasingBehavior and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press so we can help amplify your efforts.</li>

There are many ways of supporting this goal, both socially and monetarily.Financial SupportFor those in a position to contribute financially, there are publishing costs that the campaign must cover before launch. Publishing with New Degree Press allows us to keep the fundraising goals to a minimum, and if you are able to support the cause with your wallet, please help get us across the finish line. Money raised will go towards the following:
The Editor Staff - assisting in revisions and publishing the manuscript in December 2020.
The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!
The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats).
The Copyediting for My Book - to make help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this winter.
The Illustrations - bringing in quality visuals to help make complex topics easier. 
When we reach 120 pre-sale copies of the book, we will go forward with publishing. When we reach 200 pre-sale copies, we will also publish a hardcover edition. 
There are pre-order tiers (on the right of your screen) to help cover these publishing costs, and for those able to contribute financially, we are offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order the book within the campaign window:

Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book

The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting the book’s cover
And updates on newly released articles and lectures that accompany the book
Any funding that exceeds the campaign’s goal will go toward additional promotion and research initiatives.Social Support and Free ContentAs the theory points out, money is just a tool, and there are many ways that anyone can support for free. Between the campaign launch and the release date, I will be releasing free content that follows the structure of the book in the form of articles and video lectures. Viewing and sharing the content is the easiest and cheapest way to contribute, specifically:

It is about what happens when we begin to unlock and unchain all that prevents us from being human beings who are worthy of love. My book will publish in April 2020.</p><ul></ul><h2>Story of My Book</h2><p><u>Rise to the Sun: 7 Footsteps and 7 Prayers for Getting Out of Hell</u> is for anyone who wants to get out of hell and get ‘unstuck’ from pain, whether caused by the past, or the tumultuous and impossible twenty-first century present.<br/><br/>Many people believe that to ‘fix’ ourselves and the world, we need to ‘do' things differently. I believe something else: We need to see things differently. The 7 steps and 7 prayers assert a format for change: we are ready to reprogram ourselves, rather than be programmed by outside forces.<br/><br/>My name is Richard J, Marks and I am the author of <u>Rise to the Sun: 7 Footsteps and 7 Prayers for Getting Out of Hell</u>. I wrote this book to chart and illuminate the passage to the other side of grief and hopelessness, whether it is inside your heart or about the world at large.<br/><br/>The world has people marching in the streets and posting activism hashtags, but what about you? Are you free? Many of us are not any longer willing to stick with the program — the broken way. We know that old ways of doing things are not good enough. How will we get through this?<br/><br/>My hope is that you will discover and desire, more than ever, to break free, retrain yourself, and find freedom.<br/><br/>In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for getting out of hell! You will take a divorce from corrupted freedom. I want you to be able to shut out the false personality of your fears, shed old skins, and feel worthy of living. As inner conflict subsides, the kinder side of your character will win over the selfish self.<br/><br/>In this book, you will come in contact with my 50-year global odyssey through pain and desperate experience before approaching freedom. I am joined by extraordinary people from the past and present who share personal transformations that move them towards liberation and healing with others:</p><ul>
<li>Endurance, forgiveness, and resilience are sometimes not enough: we must say goodbye to our mounting grief and end our suicide</li>
<li>We begin to see what is within our immediate reach that leads to personal responsibility and spiritual activism</li>
<li>Every step of this book includes prayers, those beautiful phrases of human emotion and truth that help us see hope where there is little or none, to see beauty, to do for ourselves</li>
</ul><p>You will love this book if you are ready to stop suffering and paying a high price for what isn’t happening the way you want it to. We have much collective grief and trauma, but we have hope. We are in an age of healing ourselves and our planet. That means we are each called to task to release all that blocks love from flowing through us.</p><h2>The Book - <br/>Rise to the Sun: 7 Footsteps and 7 Prayers for Getting Out of Hell</h2><p>My book is a non-fiction book that speaks to conscious citizens who feel stuck, for whom spiritual activism is a path for seeing the world differently for the first time. <br/><br/>The book is written in 3 parts ... which can be read several ways.<br/><br/>It can be like taking a 7-day cruise with me, from embarkation to destination. Along the way, you will have time to pause, stop and think. And it can meet you wherever you are in your life, taking you from one step to the next, but not alone. Our goal is to gather together.<br/><br/>Part 1: We start with “flush the psychic toilet!” The Dedication, Prologue, Getting to the First Step, and Prayer build a way of seeing the importance of reclaiming freedom.<br/><br/>Part 2: The progression of the 7 steps and 7 prayers asserts a format of change: a progression from hopelessness and grief, to being worthy of love; and as you find it within, you begin sharing the inner journey of freedom with others.<br/><br/>Part 3: The Epilogue, we travel our freedom. It states that “travel happens in steps, progressively, but in freedom something else happens. It is seeing the whole picture.” We may experience concepts of freedom differently in West and East, but we ultimately, seeing how we travel inwardly is the same as how we travel outwardly.</p><p> </p><h2>About the Author</h2><p><strong>Richard J.

This is why we try our best to be as eco-friendly as possible. Not only will the magazine itself be printed sustainably, but the shirts &amp; bags are made with organic, Fairtrade cotton, and dyed using natural dye.

Any money we make on Indiegogo will still go towards funding the first issue. </p><p><u>PRODUCTION</u></p><p>The majority of your money will go towards printing costs.

We plan to address many different topics in the issues to come. What also makes us stand out is that we don’t just publish articles about the issue, but instead collect personal experiences on the topic at hand. We therefore include real life stories from real people. </p><p> </p><p><strong>IF YOU AIN'T GOT THE MONEY </strong>☞</p><p>If you can’t support us financially then please show your support on social media by following us on <a href=""https://instagram.com/awty_magazine/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Instagram</a> and sharing our page on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/awtymagazine/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a>.

The truth is that in many parts of the world women and men do not have equal rights. It’s not about one side having more than the other; it’s about equality.  ARE WE THERE YET & SUSTAINABILITY ☞Being a magazine that champions social justice we feel like it is important to be a sustainable brand. This is why we try our best to be as eco-friendly as possible. Not only will the magazine itself be printed sustainably, but the shirts & bags are made with organic, Fairtrade cotton, and dyed using natural dye. All the merchandise ist screen-printed in Vienna by us, using water-based, vegan ink. All the little things such as postcards, stickers, and patches are eco-friendly as well.  IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY MONEY MONEY ☞ The money we make from our campaign will go first and foremost to funding the first issue, and fulfilling the perks for our supporters (you). Any money left over will be used to fund the issues to come. If we don’t reach our funding goal we will explore other options to fund the magazine. Any money we make on Indiegogo will still go towards funding the first issue. PRODUCTIONThe majority of your money will go towards printing costs. We want to make a beautiful high quality, eco-friendly magazine and that ain't cheap.PERKST-shirts, bags, stickers, patches, and posters don’t grow on trees. Therefore some of your money will be used to fund all that cool stuff. LAUNCH PARTYYou can’t launch a magazine without a launch party… well you could, but where’s the fun in that? We need some money for booze, and snacks…lots of snacks. Thanks.  THE RISKS & CHALLENGES ☞We know the creative world is already saturated with indie magazines, which is not necessarily a bad thing, however, it poses a challenge for us as a new magazine to stand out from the crowd.What makes us different is that we are not a one issue magazine. We plan to address many different topics in the issues to come. What also makes us stand out is that we don’t just publish articles about the issue, but instead collect personal experiences on the topic at hand. We therefore include real life stories from real people.  IF YOU AIN'T GOT THE MONEY ☞If you can’t support us financially then please show your support on social media by following us on Instagram and sharing our page on Facebook. Also don't forget to check out our website and subscribe to our newsletter for regular updates! From AWTY with <3P.S. Shout out to Marlene Fally for letting us use her super dope music in our campaign video. Check out her other tunes here ☞ soundcloud.com/marlosounds",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Crynodeb</b></p>
<p>Mae’n amser i Gymru gael dechrau o’r newydd. Mae’r
llywodraeth Lafur ym Mae Caerdydd yn dal Cymru yn ôl ac yn methu â chyflawni ei
uchelgeisiau pitw ei hun – mae gan Blaid Cymru yr egni, y weledigaeth a’r
syniadau i greu Cymru well.</p>
<p>Gallwch chi helpu drwy roi rhodd fydd yn ein galluogi ni i
weithio drosoch chi a thros Gymru yn dilyn etholiad mis Mai.</p>
<p>Bydd yr arian sy’n cael ei godi’n cael ei ddefnyddio i dalu
am nifer o trefnyddion ledled y Wlad, a bydd bob un yn chwarae rhan
allweddol yn ein llwyddiant yn 2016.</p>
<p><b>Yr hyn rydym ei angen a’r hyn rydych yn ei gael</b></p>
<p>Os gwelwch yn dda rhowch be allwch chi er mwyn ein helpu i
drefnu’r ymgyrch Cynulliad orau ers dechrau datganoli.</p>
<p>Mi fydd pob ceiniog rydyn yn ei dderbyn gennych yn cael ei
wario ar helpu Plaid Cymru a Chymru i ennill yn 2016 drwy gael ymgyrch drefnus
ar lawr gwlad.</p>
<p>Rydym eisoes wedi codi £20,000 tuag at ein ‘Cyllideb
Trefnyddion’. Os gallwn godi £10,000 arall mi allwn gael effaith sylweddol – yn
enwedig gan fod un aelod hael wedi addo rhoi rhodd gyfatebol o £10,000 unwaith
rydym wedi cyrraedd y nod.</p>
<p>Y mwyaf rydym yn godi, y mwyaf y nifer o drefnwyr allwn ni
fforddio.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p><b>Yr effaith</b></p>
<p>Bydd cael trefnyddion yn cynyddu’r hyn allwn
gyflawni ac yn galluogi canghennau lleol i gydlynu eu gwaith a chyflawni mwy o
ran ymgyrchu yn lleol, codi arian a gweithgaredd eraill fydd yn bwydo mewn i
ymgyrch lwyddiannus ar gyfer etholiad Cynulliad y flwyddyn nesaf.</p>
<p><b>Ffyrdd arall gallwch helpu</b></p>

ddim yn credu na allwch chi helpu:</p>

Crynodeb
Mae’n amser i Gymru gael dechrau o’r newydd. Mae’r
llywodraeth Lafur ym Mae Caerdydd yn dal Cymru yn ôl ac yn methu â chyflawni ei
uchelgeisiau pitw ei hun – mae gan Blaid Cymru yr egni, y weledigaeth a’r
syniadau i greu Cymru well.
Gallwch chi helpu drwy roi rhodd fydd yn ein galluogi ni i
weithio drosoch chi a thros Gymru yn dilyn etholiad mis Mai.
Bydd yr arian sy’n cael ei godi’n cael ei ddefnyddio i dalu
am nifer o trefnyddion ledled y Wlad, a bydd bob un yn chwarae rhan
allweddol yn ein llwyddiant yn 2016.
Yr hyn rydym ei angen a’r hyn rydych yn ei gael
Os gwelwch yn dda rhowch be allwch chi er mwyn ein helpu i
drefnu’r ymgyrch Cynulliad orau ers dechrau datganoli.
Mi fydd pob ceiniog rydyn yn ei dderbyn gennych yn cael ei
wario ar helpu Plaid Cymru a Chymru i ennill yn 2016 drwy gael ymgyrch drefnus
ar lawr gwlad.
Rydym eisoes wedi codi £20,000 tuag at ein ‘Cyllideb
Trefnyddion’. Os gallwn godi £10,000 arall mi allwn gael effaith sylweddol – yn
enwedig gan fod un aelod hael wedi addo rhoi rhodd gyfatebol o £10,000 unwaith
rydym wedi cyrraedd y nod.
Y mwyaf rydym yn godi, y mwyaf y nifer o drefnwyr allwn ni
fforddio.




Yr effaith
Bydd cael trefnyddion yn cynyddu’r hyn allwn
gyflawni ac yn galluogi canghennau lleol i gydlynu eu gwaith a chyflawni mwy o
ran ymgyrchu yn lleol, codi arian a gweithgaredd eraill fydd yn bwydo mewn i
ymgyrch lwyddiannus ar gyfer etholiad Cynulliad y flwyddyn nesaf.
Ffyrdd arall gallwch helpu
Rydym yn deall nad yw’n bosib i bawb gyfrannu, ond dyw hynny
ddim yn credu na allwch chi helpu:

·  Helpwch ni i ledaenu’r gair drwy wneud tipyn o sŵn am yr ymgyrch. 
·  Cofiwch ddefnyddio tŵls rhannu Indiegogo! Dywedwch wrth eich ffrindiau a’ch teulu am yr ymgyrch codi arian.

Short Summary
It’s
time for a fresh start for Wales.  The Labour Welsh government is holding
Wales back and is unable to even achieve its own meagre ambitions – Plaid Cymru
has the energy, the vision and the ideas to make Wales work.
Play
your part in moving Wales forward by giving a donation that will enable us to
work for you and for Wales after May’s election.
The money raised will be used
to fund a number of organisers across the nation, all of whom will
play a key part in our success in 2016.
What
We Need & What You Get
Please
give what you can to help us organise the best Assembly election campaign since
the beginning of devolution.
Every
single penny we receive from you will go towards helping Plaid Cymru and Wales
win in 2016 by having organised campaigns on the ground.
We’ve
already raised £20,000 towards our ‘Organisers Fund’.  If we can raise
another £10,000 we will be able to make a huge impact – particularly as one
generous member has promised to match this with another £10,000. 
The
more we can raise, the more organisers we can fund.





The Impact
Having organisers will help increase capacity and allow local branches to co-ordinate
activity and accomplish more local campaigning, fund raising and activities
which will all help to feed into a successful campaign for next year’s Assembly
election.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Truth be told, JJ Rowan and Nate Logan have never met. Yes, you read that right.</p>
<p>Thanks to poetry, we started crossing paths on the Internet about a decade ago. Nate published an early poem of JJ's in <i>Spooky Boyfriend</i>, an online journal that was a precursor to Spooky Girlfriend Press. Some years later, JJ published Nate in <i>Tarratine</i>, a magazine she co-published with an arts collective in central Maine, and invited him to read via Skype at one of their events. We kept (virtually) bumping into each other. We shared work and conversation. Correspondence turned into collaboration.</p>
<p>Fast forward: 100 sonnets and a chapbook publication later, we're going on tour.</p>
<p>The idea came out of some very exciting news: Nate's first full-length book of poems would be published by Magic Helicopter Press this fall! He wanted to do a reading tour! It probably started with JJ making a joke about tagging along. Joking turned into planning. It was high time for a face-to-face.</p>
<p>So...our faces officially go on tour in a month!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>Here's the deal: this is an entirely self-funded and self-organized tour. We're hoping to offset the cost of the tour by sharing our tour experience and some extra special publication goodies with you. In mid-October, we'll hit the road to read in the following cities (now with updates!):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Friday, Oct. 12 (with Peter Davis) @ 6:30pm<br/>Books &amp; Brews (Mass Ave.)<br/>Indianapolis, IN</p></li>
<li><p>Saturday, Oct. 13 <br/>Badger Castle House Reading (Time TBA)<br/>Grand Rapids, MI<br/>*contact us for more info!*</p></li>
<li><p>Monday, Oct. 15 @ 6pm<br/>Sherman Perk Coffee Shop <br/>Milwaukee, WI </p></li>
<li><p>Wednesday, Oct. 17 (it's a double feature!)<br/>Boneshaker Books @ 5pm<br/>Eat My Words! @ 7pm<br/>Minneapolis, MN</p></li>
<li><p>Friday, Oct 19 (Nate IRL &amp; JJ in spirit!) @ 7pm<br/>The Spirit Room<br/>Fargo, ND</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We've set this campaign at Indiegogo's minimum of $500 and would love to reach that goal. These funds will go directly to practical tour expenses, including</p>
<ul>
<li>Car Rental</li>
<li>Gas</li>
<li>Lodging</li>
<li>JJ's Airfare from Oregon to Indiana</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll cover our own impractical tour expenses (which mostly include JJ's caffeine habit and Nate's pumpkin obsession). </p>
<p>So! We're offering two ways to support us:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Tour Experience: Perks include video updates from the road and broadside postcards featuring collaborative sonnets and personal messages from us, sent to you during the tour.</li>
<li>The Publication Experience: Perks include publications by either (or both) of us, signed for you with an exclusive Bearface bookmark (Bearface is JJ's incredible cat), sent to you after our time on the road (late October/early November).</li>
<li>Bonus: Whether you donate funds or give us a boost with a share, we'll be keeping a tour diary that we'll share with everyone (more on that as our departure date approaches)!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Misc.</h3>
<p>If you can and want to help support us with cold hard cash, great! We endlessly appreciate you and hope our humble perks help get that across. If you'd like to help without the dollar sign, we could absolutely use it in these ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Spread the word!</strong> Sharing our campaign on social media, via email, or word of mouth will help us get funded even if you can't offer any dollars.</li>
<li>
<strong>Offer advice!</strong> Pearls of wisdom from your own poetry tours are welcome, as are insights into the areas we'll travel through. Must-try local foodstuffs? Awesomely weird attractions? Send 'em our way.</li>
<li>
<strong>Host us! </strong>As we finalize the specifics of our readings, we may be looking for folks who host reading series, have contacts at venues, or can offer a place to crash. Drop us a line.</li>
<li>
<strong>Host us in the future!</strong> While we're sticking to parts of the Midwest this time, we're scheming for possible future tours. Let us know where you'd like to see us read.</li>
<li>
<strong>Attend a reading!</strong> Do you live in or around one of the cities listed? Let us share some poetry with your ears! Let us give you an actual high five! Stay tuned for details.</li>

The Tour Experience: Perks include video updates from the road and broadside postcards featuring collaborative sonnets and personal messages from us, sent to you during the tour.
The Publication Experience: Perks include publications by either (or both) of us, signed for you with an exclusive Bearface bookmark (Bearface is JJ's incredible cat), sent to you after our time on the road (late October/early November).
Bonus: Whether you donate funds or give us a boost with a share, we'll be keeping a tour diary that we'll share with everyone (more on that as our departure date approaches)!


The Misc.
If you can and want to help support us with cold hard cash, great! We endlessly appreciate you and hope our humble perks help get that across. If you'd like to help without the dollar sign, we could absolutely use it in these ways:


Spread the word! Sharing our campaign on social media, via email, or word of mouth will help us get funded even if you can't offer any dollars.

Offer advice! Pearls of wisdom from your own poetry tours are welcome, as are insights into the areas we'll travel through. Must-try local foodstuffs? Awesomely weird attractions? Send 'em our way.

Host us! As we finalize the specifics of our readings, we may be looking for folks who host reading series, have contacts at venues, or can offer a place to crash. Drop us a line.

Host us in the future! While we're sticking to parts of the Midwest this time, we're scheming for possible future tours. Let us know where you'd like to see us read.

Attend a reading! Do you live in or around one of the cities listed? Let us share some poetry with your ears! Let us give you an actual high five! Stay tuned for details.

Wow! Thanks for reading this far! Here's some info about our recent work, including links to some publications and reviews:

<h3>The Story of My Book</h3>
<i>The Psyche Behind Sci-Fi: the Power of Point of View</i> is an educational think piece that teaches you what point of view in fiction writing is and how it can affect the sci-fi reading and writing experience.<br/><br/>My name is Kristin Smith and I am the author of <i>The Psyche Behind Sci-fi: the Power of POV</i>. I wrote this book because I want to share what I’ve learned about fiction writing.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that point of view influences every aspect of storytelling. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for point of view. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you learn what each point of view has to offer.<br/><br/><strong>In this book, you'll learn about the formal and creative applications of point of view. You'll see things such as...</strong><ul>
<li>Short essays on how perspective shapes classic pieces such as <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> by Jane Austen, <i>The Turn of a Screw</i> by Henry James, “Everyday Use” by Alice Walker, and more .</li>
<li>Original short stories and sci-fi pieces in each point of view.</li>
<li>A sneak peek into the plot of my (other) upcoming book <i>Incipience</i>
</li>
</ul>You will love this book if you are interested in learning more about point of view writing, are curious about fiction writing craft, and want to learn the formal/academic applications of point of view.<br/><br/><i>The Psyche Behind Sci-Fi: the Power of Point of View</i> is a creative nonfiction book that speaks to novice writers and sci-fi fans who want to learn more about writing and the intricacies of sci-fi in a new way.<br/> <h3><i>The Psyche Behind Sci-Fi: the Power of Point of View</i></h3>
<br/>The book is written in two parts.<br/><br/>Part one contains the introduction and chapters 1-5. These chapters teach you the four types of first person point of view. In this section, you’ll learn about the types of narrators, plot elements, and tones associated with the first and second person perspectives. <br/><br/>Part two contains chapters 6-8. Unlike the first and second person points of view, third person perspectives don’t have specific narrator types, so this second section instead dives into the scope of the third person perspectives and the insight these points of view. <br/><br/><br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>
<li>The <strong>editor</strong> I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2021.</li>
<li>The <strong>cover design</strong> of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The<strong> layout design</strong> for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The<strong> copy editing</strong> for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The <strong>launch &amp; promotion efforts </strong>for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring.</li>
</ul>
<br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.<br/> <ul>
<li>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</li>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.</li>

I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. <br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use.

Without the assistance of loans or credit cards, we purchased one short school bus last August to deliver our food to the schools we serve. However, being that it is an older bus, there are important mechanical and aesthetic repairs that need to be done. We not only need to have our bus safe for our staff but we also want it to be noticeable to our community. We would like everyone to know that our bus is ""THE"" bus that serves Albuquerque charter schools the freshest and healthiest foods available. Adding three additional charter school contracts this year, we will also need to purchase another short bus to get our food to all 6 of our schools hot and on time. 
This is why we ask for your help. With your contribution, we can continue to transport and serve healthy foods as well as promote our local economy. Because we buy the majority of our fresh food from local farmers and vendors, we are thrilled and grateful that we can impact Albuquerque's youth, economy and community in such a positive way. With transportation covered, our plan is to then expand our business to include educating children in ways that create healthier, more sustainable lifestyles. 
Thank you for your interest in what Bocadillos' campaign is all about.

The American Guinea Hog was recently upgraded from Critical to Endangered by The Livestock Conservancy. Just one decade ago, it was on the brink of extinction. When I discovered the breed, I wanted to find out as much as possible about it, but there is very little information out there.

As an educator and researcher in my prior career, I wanted to learn and share this information to other homesteaders like me. <br/><p><br/></p>
<p>I will be interviewing current and previous breeders of the American Guinea Hog, as well as chefs who promote its succulent meat and lard. I'm also contacting elders who remember the hog from an earlier time. I will collect their stories, determine themes and patterns, and share the information in book form.  The end product will actually be a series of three books:</p>

</div> <div> <h3>Funding Goals<br/>
</h3> <ul>
<li>I currently have several important interviews completed. Each one is about 90 - 120 minutes long. Even at a competitive rate, transcribing these recorded interviews will cost me $68-90 per interview. If I meet my goal, I will have funds to transcribe about 20 interviews after deducting indiegogo, credit card, and PayPal fees.<br/>
</li>
<li>I plan to have future fundraisers to cover costs of additional interviews, book cover art, printing, and editing. Any additional funds raised in this fundraiser will be applied to these essential needs. </li>
<li>If I do not meet my goal, I will not be able to transcribe as many interviews, and the book project will be delayed. <br/>
</li> <li>I am offering perks very unique to Broad River Pastures that you will not find anywhere else. There is a wide range of perks to meet most budgets. Thank you for supporting our cause! <br/>

</h3> <p>Your support to this project will make a huge difference to me, to the American Guinea Hog, and to current and future stewards of this incredible heritage animal. <br/></p> <ul>
<li>The American Guinea Hog has unique genetic traits and is least related to most other breeds of hogs. If the hog is lost, so are its unique characteristics.</li>
<li>This hog must be raised differently than other breeds, but there is little information out there to help breeders. <br/>
</li>
<li>Stories of the hogs and how they were saved from extinction have not been written down and shared with a wider audience. Their stories are important and worthy of preservation. <br/>

Just thirteen months later, we were blessed with 37 piglets from our first 5 farrowings! My former campaign perks were delivered promptly with only a few delays. My backers were appreciative and very supportive.

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> At this point I do not know when my writing project will be finalized in book form.

<li>My history of completing a doctoral dissertation from 1996-2004 indicates that I do not give up on long term research projects and have the ability to synthesize interviews into a readable form. <br/>
</li> <li>I will repeat fundraising efforts as needed in order to keep this project going without putting myself in debt for the project. <br/>
</li>
<li>Perks will be distributed on time prior to writing the book. My intention is to complete my first book in 2015. <br/>
</li> </ul>

<li>You can still help by linking to the campaign on your social media tools! It doesn't cost a cent to share!</li>
<li>Please note that if you do make a contribution, funds paid via PayPal will be available to me immediately.

<h2>Me and my story</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>My name is
Raquel Caldevilla and I’m a 30 years old Portuguese girl, from the lovely city
of Porto. </p>
<p>When I was
little, I always wanted to work with people, to see how they were and act. So I
became a psychologist specialized in Expressive/Creative Therapies (art, music,
dance and drama/theatre) and since then I began working with children, one of
the things that I love most. I was focused on helping searching our inner child,
that piece of innocence that makes us sincerest, simpler, and more honest. </p>
<p>A few
months ago, I created a personal blog, where I write about my daily
inspirations on real people, those around me, such as family, friends or
simply those who cross my path every day.  The reaction was so positive that I started to
write more and creating other stories. I decided to compile a book about twelve
people, a collection of short stories, a series of tales. The main bond between
them is my background, each one of them has a rare psychological condition, although
it’s not the central narrative of the stories. Children see things in a simple
way so does each character in my book, that’s why their disease is just
secondary in each story. </p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>I wanted to talk about serious issues in an easy going way, so even the object has to be simple. It will look like a children’s book, it will feel like one, but each story has a depth that only adults can understand. I cannot do it on my own, that’s why I invited a bunch of creative people to help me. Meet:</p>
<p>- <b>Fred Gomes</b>, designer, photographer and a man of a thousand ways, he will help with videos, photography and the book design.<br/><br/>- <b>Mariana, the Miserable one</b>, she’s an amazing illustrator with an unique point of view. She’ll do the illustrations for each tale.</p>
<p>- <b>The girls from beija-flor</b>, a project that creates handcrafted notebooks, specially to thank each one of you.</p>
<p>- And finally <b>John Almeida</b>, a musician and an awesome writer. He will be in charge of the English translation.</p>
<p>It is ambitious and involves a lot of people that’s why <b>I need 4000€</b>. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">So I come to ask you for your help to edit my first book, a book of short stories inspired by real people. </span></p>

Me and my story


Hi there!
My name is
Raquel Caldevilla and I’m a 30 years old Portuguese girl, from the lovely city
of Porto. 
When I was
little, I always wanted to work with people, to see how they were and act. So I
became a psychologist specialized in Expressive/Creative Therapies (art, music,
dance and drama/theatre) and since then I began working with children, one of
the things that I love most. I was focused on helping searching our inner child,
that piece of innocence that makes us sincerest, simpler, and more honest. 
A few
months ago, I created a personal blog, where I write about my daily
inspirations on real people, those around me, such as family, friends or
simply those who cross my path every day.  The reaction was so positive that I started to
write more and creating other stories. I decided to compile a book about twelve
people, a collection of short stories, a series of tales. The main bond between
them is my background, each one of them has a rare psychological condition, although
it’s not the central narrative of the stories. Children see things in a simple
way so does each character in my book, that’s why their disease is just
secondary in each story. 




12 - The Book and the project

I wanted to talk about serious issues in an easy going way, so even the object has to be simple. It will look like a children’s book, it will feel like one, but each story has a depth that only adults can understand. I cannot do it on my own, that’s why I invited a bunch of creative people to help me. Meet:
- Fred Gomes, designer, photographer and a man of a thousand ways, he will help with videos, photography and the book design.- Mariana, the Miserable one, she’s an amazing illustrator with an unique point of view. She’ll do the illustrations for each tale.
- The girls from beija-flor, a project that creates handcrafted notebooks, specially to thank each one of you.
- And finally John Almeida, a musician and an awesome writer. He will be in charge of the English translation.
It is ambitious and involves a lot of people that’s why I need 4000€. So I come to ask you for your help to edit my first book, a book of short stories inspired by real people. 



How can you help?
First of all, thank you so much for just standing there and read about my project. Your contribution can be in a various number of ways, specially written in a list on your right, in a series of perks.
However, I understand if you cannot contribute with money, so I come to ask you to tell your friends about my story and share my project through social media like Facebook, Youtube or Twitter. Here is the link to my Facebook fan page where you can see everything that I write in my blog and also know a little more about myself.
Please share this with your friends and family so I can achieve my goal!
Thanks so much in advance!

<p>The
Emma Goldman Papers is part of a national initiative to retrieve the papers of
individuals whose life work has had a lasting impact on the course of American
history. Emma Goldman (1869-1940) was a tireless advocate of free
expression and social justice. Her papers are a treasure trove of women’s,
immigration, ethnic, transnational, political, cultural, sexual, and civil
liberties histories.  In keeping with her spirit, the Emma Goldman Papers
Project’s focus is, and always has been, on public education through open
access to original sources. </p>
<p>Since
1980, the Project has located, copied, identified, organized, and published
over 22,000 documents previously unavailable or little known, not only about
Emma Goldman but also focused on the political and cultural milieu surrounding
her life and work. Currently, we are composing the last volume of our
four-part documentary history series, <i>Emma Goldman: A Documentary
History of The American Years (1890-1919)</i>. The last volume, covering
the years of 1917-1919, resonates strongly with concerns about immigration and
deportation law, surveillance, limitations on free speech in times of national
crisis, prison conditions, and the fragility of citizenship for those who were
not born in the U.S. </p><p><br/></p>

complexity and nuance to the work, and confirmed the importance of situating
advocates of free expression into the historical record as a lasting tribute to
courageous spirits."" The project provides students the rare opportunity to
engage in political theory, critical writing skills, and historical research
with authentic primary documents. We believe these resources have not only
launched many students, volunteers, and community members into careers
of activism, education, and writing, but also enriched their personal lives. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/614955/files/20140530142128-egp-banner-books.jpg?1401484888"" src="""" style=""""/></p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Above: Three of the volumes produced so far by the Emma Goldman Papers Project, see <a href=""http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520086708"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vol.1</a>, <a href=""http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520225695"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vol.2</a>, and<a href=""http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=21071"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vol.3</a> here.

a side project over ten years ago. I pulled it back out a few years ago, and
realized how much I loved this story and these characters. I decided to rewrite

intertwining, people changing each other for better and worse, loss, regret,
finding strength when all hope is lost, love and growth. I hope this story

Synopsis:



About the book:
The Warrior series is about the choices we make and the choices that are forced upon
us. It
is a story about finding purpose, love and peace with ourselves and the lives
we create. 

Why preorder?Your support allows me to pay for the first print run of the book at a discounted rate. This allows me to offer the book to you with bonuses like fantastic artwork at a discount. Without having to pay for all expenses out of pocket, I am able to focus on the work itself and pour my creative energy into book 2 to get it ready to print. 
Why self publish?
Big publishing houses don't have the luxury of printing unknown
authors very often. It is risky and the chance of making a profit is incredibly
low. Often times, they have a specific type of material they want to package
and sell in a specific way. My story doesn't fit a genre perfectly, and I don't
want to force it to be something different.



A Warrior's Guilt is a book that is near and dear to me. I began working on it as
a side project over ten years ago. I pulled it back out a few years ago, and
realized how much I loved this story and these characters. I decided to rewrite
it for myself. What I ended up creating was a story of lives
intertwining, people changing each other for better and worse, loss, regret,
finding strength when all hope is lost, love and growth. I hope this story
touches you, entertains you, and maybe gets you to laugh a few times.
By self publishing, I did not have to censor myself or the
story I wanted to tell. That is what I want to share with you. The biggest
downfall of self publishing is its price, since printers have to be paid up front for manuscripts or for the additional cost of print on demand availability.
Both raise the cost of the manuscript much higher than a traditional paperback, printed in publishing houses.
After this pre-order print run, the book will be made available through
print on demand sales at a retail price that I have no control over. It
is determined by the print company and Amazon. By preordering, you will allow
me to purchase the books in volume, dropping the price down to a closer to mass market price level and allowing me to pass that discount directly to you.



So, this is a series?
A Warrior's Guilt is
book one. It is 100% completed and ready to be printed and shipped.
A Warrior's Repentance
is book two. It will be released in the spring of 2016. It is more than halfway done currently.
A Warrior's Absolution
is book three. It will be released in the spring of 2017. It has been outlined
and prepared. This is the intended end of the series, but you know how
characters can be. They tend to take on a life of their own, and one more book
might be in order...



Where is the money going?



49% to Printing and production of physical books and perks


17% to Shipping


13% Legal fees  This includes barcodes, official copyright filing with the Library of Congress, the ISBN (International Standard Book Number). This is a required registration in order to distribute book and book like products to booksellers, libraries, universities, wholesalers and other distributors. The barcodes are required for larger companies to catalogue my books. Each edition of a book (hardcover/softcover) requires a different ISBN and barcode. 


12% Marketing


9% Indiegogo/ Paypal/ Credit card payment fees. 


Any money raised beyond the goal will simply go towards a larger print run, and to securing ISBNs and barcodes for the rest of the series.


Ebooks?
I am a huge fan of
physical books. I love the way they feel, the touch and smell of paper, holding
a book in my hands. I currently do not have plans to distribute this series as
an ebook. That may change in the future. As I wrote earlier, I have put a lot
of thought, time, and money into the creation of the physical object and would
prefer to share it in that form.
Risks:
This book is completed and already set to publish. I have
already received a proof of the first book and have prepared it for distribution.
At the end of the pre-order period, the full order will be sent to press. Printing will
take 4-5 weeks. As soon as the printers get the books to me, they will be
packed with care and shipped your way. The proofs arrived in less than 2 weeks from ordering, so I
expect that the full run will come in a timely fashion. I will update through indiegogo
should any problems in printing or shipments arise. 

Perks:
There are several support tiers for this pre-print campaign.  For details on each, please see the listing running down the right side of the page. All levels include shipping within the US. Outside of the US, please add a small shipping fee.
The exclusive art book will ONLY be available through this campaign and in a very limited quantity. It contains visual designs for some of the characters, full photos from the cover shoots, a making of, and artwork based on the series.

<p>Soy un osteópata de Barcelona. Una

empezar un proyecto que permitiría hacer conocer mi pasión, mi forma de vida,
mi trabajo. Creí que lo tenía que hacer y los medios audiovisuales eran el
mejor camino.</p>
<p>Sentía que mucha gente en
nuestro país no conocía mi profesión, la Osteopatía, ni sus beneficios para la
salud. Y no podía entender porque nadie había pensado con anterioridad en
realizar un documental, que además fuera una herramienta para promocionar y
difundir la osteopatía como una profesión sanitaria, como en otros países.</p>
<p>Queremos producir este
documental para las televisiones de habla inglesa, francesa, españolas y porque
no, para redes sociales, con el fin de hacer pública las investigaciones
científicas, sus resultados y la incongruencia legal que existe en la
regulación europea de la Osteopatía, y además poner de manifiesto la situación
actual a nivel académico y profesional en Europa y Estados Unidos.</p>
<p>Nuestra meta es presentar la
Osteopatía y sus bases científicas a través de un itinerario geográfico de la
historia de ésta. Para este propósito se harán entrevistas a osteópatas,
investigadores, pacientes y médicos de EEUU, Inglaterra, Francia y España.</p>

<h3>A Mother's Dreams ...</h3>
<p>I have dreams for my children. I dream that one day my daughter will be able to tell me how she feels, what she wants, who she is. I dream she will have a friend, just one, to call her own. I dream she will have a future filled with normal things - a job, a family, security. My dreams for my son are much simpler. I dream he will be alive the day I die ...</p>
</div>
<h3>Love, Faith, Hope, and Dreams</h3>
<p>These are the four pillars that make up our lives, the four pillars that sustain us. Every day is a struggle. You see my daughter is autistic. I know each and every one of you think you know what this means but I can tell you, unless you are the loved one of an autistic child, you don't really have a clue. Every day is a struggle. Every moment of every day is a struggle. My daughter lives in a world, our world, that is completely foreign to her. It is too loud, too bright, too scary. Her brain is constantly inundated with unfiltered input. She is constantly overwhelmed, confused, and under immense amounts of stress. Let me help you to understand ...</p>
<p>Imagine yourself in the noisiest, brightest, busiest place you have ever been. Imagine you see, hear, smell, and feel everything; you cannot filter anything out. Can you feel your stress levels rising? Now imagine you can never get away from this place. Imagine you are stuck there every day and every night. This is my daughter's life.</p>
<p>Let's switch gears now. Imagine you are five years old. What would your biggest concerns be? The toys you want, the things you want to do, maybe a playdate with your best friend? What about the very real fear of death? What about the fear of blood work and needles and doctors and pain and sickness? This is my son's reality. He is in renal failure. His kidneys have failed once; they will fail again. Right now he should be that first little boy worried about normal things but every moment of his day is tinged by the fear of death.</p>
<p>This is our life. This is our reality.</p>
<p>How do we make it through every day? Love, Faith, Hope, and Dreams ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Love - We share as much love as possible every single moment of every day of our lives.</li>
<li>Faith - We hold onto life with faith - faith that it will all work out for us, faith that we will have what we need.</li>
<li>Hope - Hope is the steadfast pillar, the one that cannot falter lest we falter with it. Without hope, we are lost.</li>
<li>Dreams - We all have our dreams. My son dreams of working for Cirque du Soliel when he grows up. My daughter dreams of ""not being autistic"".</li>
</ul><p>Your help will mean we can begin to live our dreams. I will be able to publish our story and share with the world the power of the Four Pillars. My children will have security. This is a life-changing moment for us and we need your help.</p>
<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>I am trying to raise money to self-publish my three part memoir. This requires financial seed money, money I do not have. The funds we raise will be used in five ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Books - Approximately $3500+ will be used for the first print run of the book.</li>
<li>Start-up - About $2000 will be used to establish an online presence for the books, pay for startup costs, production costs (ISBN, registrations, etc.), marketing, and any unforeseen expenses (of which I am sure there will be some of these).</li>
<li>Editing - $1000 has been budgeted for editing and converting the book to e-versions.</li>
<li>Fees and Perks - About $1500 of the money will be used to pay the fees and expenses for the campaign.</li>
<li>Charity - Any money raised beyond our needs will be donated to Give Kids the World, the Village in Orlando for sick children.</li>
</ul><h3>Other Ways to Help </h3>
<div>
<p>We know how tight money can be. Even if you cannot contribute, there are three big ways you can help us!</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out for us! Share our campaign with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, or even face to face! This would be the best way to help us out.</li>
<li>Tell the people in your lives how much you love them. You never know when life will take them away from you. Be thankful for your what you have. I am always telling my children this. Be thankful for what you have.</li>
<li>Finally remember to Live Your Dreams!</li>

<h2>AMREKIE!</h2>
<p><strong>An Impractical Travel Guide</strong><br/><em>And Musings On Being An American Working In The Arab World.</em></p>
<h3>An impractical travel guide you say?</h3>
<p>My name is Jarrod Wilson and I had the strange fortune to spend the last several years working for a Saudi Prince. Crazy, I know, right. During that time I traveled to 11 countries and discovered a world of international business that was a dizzing mix of traditional values and modernity. I want to share the trials and errors (ok mostly errors) that I experienced along the way. Part travel guide, part misadventure story, I plan to write a pocket guide for the Arabian traveler as only a midwestern American boy could. This is the book I WISH I would have had. I will provide vital information and humerous stories from my own experiences.</p>
<p>You don't need to travel from your own comfortable chair to take this adventure with me. I will explore Islam, international business, common mistakes, customs issues, resolving conflict, security concerns and when to just let it all go.</p>
<p>It will be a great adventure and I invite you take it with me. I hope to be there with you, in your bag, when things get interesting.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Help me to help other travelers.</h3>
<p>What I hope to accomplish with this campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fund the final editing of the content</li>
<li>Produce a limited 500 edition print run of the book</li>
<li>If I don't reach my goal I plan to release a digital only version</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Bringing understanding with humor.</h3>
<p>One of my biggest discoveries was just how little these two cultures understand about each other. I am hoping, in a humerous way of bridging the divide even just a little, while providing invaluable tips for the traveler. </p>
<p>I appreciate your support and look forward to sharing some great stories with you, and if I help you along the way with your own travels well then, hamdullah.</p>

</div></div>","I have a story to tell or maybe quite a few, so I wrote this book. 

It's a true story of my mom and I and it begins when I meet her after a long separation at the age of eleven. She was a heroin addict who suffered from mental illness and this is the story of my longing for her to be something else until the day she died and I realized the perfection of exactly what she was. 

There are plenty of salacious tales along the way of our lives that while often estranged, were always connected. 

It's not easy to describe what an entire book is about but to throw a couple of ideas at you, there's plenty of promiscuity, some incarceration, lots of drugs, heartbreak, some boxed wine, self-loathing, intense loneliness, international stripping and of course, yearning for nothings and nobodies. 

In very non-traditional ways, my mother taught me everything I know, which may be nothing at all but I'll let you be the judge. 

I intend to reach readers who, like me, have felt alone with the intensity of their sadness and who have craved people that devastate them. I would be audacious and actually quite stupid to say that I have overcome the dark places entirely but with humor and relatability, maybe someone reading will feel connected and less like jumping off the nearest bridge. 

The money I am raising is to firstly pay for an editor. I have chosen Shari Goldhagen in NY. She comes highly recommended and I am excited to get started with the polishing process.

From there, I intend to do an e-book conversion and start selling that, so that I can go to agents with a book that is already making progress and drum up the kind of interest a first-time author has a very hard time doing otherwise. 

I would like to hire a publicist as well, to help with this process so that my Facebook friends don't all delete me with the irritation that being bombarded with shameless self-promotion induces. 

Your help and sharing of this link fills me with gratitude that shakes my core. This has been a dream of mine for a very long time and watching it come into fruition totally rocks my world!

<h3><font size=""3"">The Book</font></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font size=""3"">We've come to a crossroads in
human history. We either willingly support each other and our planet,
or we are forced to support elitist institutions, our own
slavery, and ultimately our own destruction. I wish to put my talents of researching, reporting and writing into the service of convincing humanity to travel the first road, not the second. by writing a book because once the rebellion succeeds, we must face the task of building a better society, <br/></font></p>
<font size=""3""><br/>The working title of my book is:<span style=""color: rgb(204, 0, 0);""> </span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 204, 102);""><span style=""color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"">After Occupation: Creating Prosperity &amp; Sustainability for All.</span> </span>The book would do three things: 1) EXPLAIN why contemporary Western 
industrial economics, whether capitalist or socialist, CAN'T work for 
us, because of structural problems that are not solvable by greater personal responsibility, by the establishment and recognition of employment as a human right, or by voting in another faction. One such structural problem, the competitive job market, is 
detailed in my video; 2) DESCRIBE some alternatives from historical and current indigenous practices e.g. gift economies, and alternatives currently in place in contemporary 
Western societies e.g. local currencies; and 3)  SUGGEST some of the 
questions we need to ask e.g. what is wealth? and values we need to develop, e.g. cooperation over competition, in order transform these historical examples and contemporary small-scale experiments into fully operational communities worldwide. <br/><br/></font><h3><font size=""3"">The Author</font></h3>
<font size=""3"">I'm Kellia Ramares-Watson, a 56-year-old independent writer and radio producer from Oakland, California. I've worked a wide variety of jobs in my day: full-time, part-time, 
through temp agencies and direct hire, for a solo entrepreneur and for 
large corporations. At least five corporations for which I have worked 
no longer exist, including two 
that were very proud to have never laid off anyone during the Great
 Depression. I have even tried my own hand at small business by 
stringing tennis rackets, reading astrology charts and most recently, by
 producing news stories and public affairs programs for radio stations 
and websites. <br/><br/></font><p><font size=""3"">I have a BA in Economics from Fordham 
University in New York, and thus was trained in the rigorous analytical methods for 
which the Jesuits are famous. I was, in my youth, a political activist 
in traditional party politics. I am currently a ""decline to state"" voter
 who is a member of two international email lists that discuss the gift 
economy and demonetization (the abolition of monetary systems).  I've known what it's like to default on 
student loans because college was a hindrance to getting a job. I've known what it's like to declare 
bankruptcy, to go to a food bank, and to be seriously ill (2 strokes and
 a heart attack) without health insurance. I have seen the profession of journalism self-destruct as both a way to protect our democracy and a 
way for me to pay the bills. In short, my entire life has been a preparation for writing this book.<br/></font></p>
</div><div>
<h3><font size=""3"">The Impact</font></h3>
<font size=""3"">The Occupy Movement and the upcoming US Presidential election makes NOW the time to focus on completing the book, so that the ideas and examples in it can be a part of the discussion on the shape of the world going 
forward. Despite furious opposition, more people seem open as never before to the idea 
that we just CAN'T continue in the same vein much longer. <br/><br/>I don't claim to be any kind of genius or Messiah; I'm a journalist 
whose personal and professional experiences put me in a position to 
present facts, questions and ideas, my own and others', into a vital 
discussion of what to do to replace this ever-deteriorating economic and
 political situation of permanent war, destruction of civil liberties 
and ecological decline. <br/><br/>As I have searched for venues at which to speak on alternative economics, I have 
discovered that it takes a book to really grab people's attention. Even 
if they don't actually read it, people will automatically assume the author of a book has a certain 
gravitas that is matched perhaps only by a maker of feature-length 
documentaries. No matter how many radio 
interviews I produce or articles that I write for various web sites, the
 fact remains that I can get more speaking engagements, more journalists
 to interview me, and more people who would be willing to be interviewed
 by me 
for future projects on point if I were the author of a book. <br/><br/></font><p><font size=""3"">Already, a local Internet radio host, who was referred to me by a colleague, disappeared after I told him that my book would not be out
 until sometime next year. He was looking for an imminent release, a 
""news hook"" on which he could peg an interview. All
 news, and most public affairs shows, are built around events rather 
than ideas per se. A book release is such an 
event. The special events 
coordinator of a local community radio station told me he picked 
speakers by perusing lists of books that had recently been released. There are many book stores in the San Francisco Bay Area that host speaking events, but of course, they want the event to be in connection with a book release.<br/></font></p>

<h3><strong>Trekcho: Cutting Through, Cutting Away</strong></h3>
<p>In December 2011, I took retreat alone for nearly two weeks, on a ranch in Georgia. Each day I rode horses. I rode in the rain, the sleet, the cold wind, a few days under a hot sun, and I wrote.  I wrote page after page, and in so doing, I examined my life.  I made some decisions.  Decisions to cut through false ideas of self and the identity to which I was clinging, and to let many material things go in order to make some room – create a gap, so to speak – so that I could devote my life to a more authentic path.  Generally, I desired a journey of body, mind and experience.  More specifically, I longed for a much simpler life of writing, travel, teaching yoga, returning to a meditation practice, and horses.  Yes, <em>horses</em>. </p>
<p>In the space I created – in the gap between what was and what could be – three incredible opportunities arose: </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">1. To teach yoga and offer workshops, in a lovely space, on a beautiful   island, closer to the teachers with whom I want to study and deepen my skills;  </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">2. To receive lessons and training in natural horsemanship, and be exposed to a gifted teacher and horses year round, in a positive setting;  and</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">3. To deepen my Buddhist practice via an intensive three year foundational program of study in the lineage that inspires me most deeply, most profoundly.</p>
<p>In order to honor these opportunities, I set a date for departure from a place I love and have called home for many years. I lightened my load by donating and gifting many possessions. I also significantly simplified my life and lowered my living expenses.  I raised money by selling nearly everything else I own, teaching and consulting. But the funds I have raised are not enough to cover my estimated expenses for the first year of this transition.  In my many years of offering <em>pro bono</em> and volunteer service, and fundraising for organizations, I learned an important lesson.  Yes, you must identify the need, and tell the story, openly and honestly.  But that is not enough.  You must also <em>ask</em>:  ask for assistance, ask for help, ask for funding. </p>
<p>And then trust.  Just trust. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Poetry is my life. It is my way of connecting with other people, reminding myself that I am not alone. It is also my therapy.</p>
<p>I've spent much of the past year and a half building the slam poetry scene in Rockford, Illinois, a city that knows very little about the art form.</p>
<p>This work has included:</p>
<ul>
<li>teaching elementary and high schoolers about the meaning of slam poetry</li>
<li>working one-on-one with new slam poets to better their stage presence</li>
<li>hosting open mics at a local coffee shop, and working with the owner of another local shop in order to put on the city's first monthly poetry slam since 2005.</li>
</ul>
<div>After investing so much time in behind-the-scenes work, I now feel the need to focus on my own poetry.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My personal goal for 2013 is to do the following:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>travel to poetry slams west of the Mississippi in order to meet new poets, and see new poetry scenes (I'd like to make stops in Idaho, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and California)</li>
<li>bring back experience and knowledge to Rockford, IL to help make the poetry scene here stronger </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>I am planning on taking several months off from my job this summer to travel and perform poetry and need to raise some money to make this trip possible.</div>

<h3>What I Need </h3>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>In order to accomplish this goal, I will need to take time off work. This presents some special challenges because I have type 1 diabetes that costs me approx. $150 every month in medical prescriptions.</p>
<p>My estimate for the amount of money I need to raise is $2,500 for a three month trip. This money would cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>medical prescriptions for type 1 diabetes ($450 for three months)</li>
<li>phone bill ($150 for three months)</li>
<li>Greyhound bus fare ($243 to Rexburg, $179 from Rexburg to Denver, $188 from Denver to Bellingham, $50 from Bellingham to Portland, $94 from Portland to San Francisco, $250 for return fare to Illinois)</li>
<li>food, etc. ($225 for three months)</li>
<li>lodging ($500 to cover any places couch surfing isn't available)</li>
</ul>
<p>If my entire fundraising goal is not met, I will put all my money raised to the same use, I just may not travel as far as I anticipated.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I really feel like this project will not only benefit myself, but also my home poetry scene.</p>
<p>I believe that this trip will help many Rockford poets in the long run. My aim is that by taking a break from organizing and hosting events, I can return to Rockford and feel newly energized about creating/running events and helping other poets better their craft.</p>
<p>I've been feeling very burnt out on my local scene. This trip is necessary to help me overcome that feeling.</p>

I am now an executive and team coach, a web entrepreneur (e.g. a crowd funding platform) and a novelist. </font></font></font></span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""""><font><font color=""#000000""><font size=""3"">My literary voyage began on a sunny Saturday of May 2008.

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""""><font><font color=""#000000""><font size=""3"">I immediately felt the power of this simple idea. I was captivated. The need to tell this impossible story became irresistible. With passion, I immersed myself in dozens of books, films and online material about Judaism, Holocaust, quantum physics, Kabbalah, the subtleties of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and many other topics. Sometimes I felt stuck and overwhelmed by the complexity of certain subjects, then something unexpectedly happened, a providential helping hand, a synchronicity, an almost miraculous encounter, an inspiring coincidence. Like a colonel of Tsahal (Israeli army) who sat ""by chance"" next to me in a bar of an international hotel in Brussels ... Or a former ambassador of Israel who showed up in front of me in a train heading for Paris, after I I uttered his name the day before ...</font></font></font></span></p><p></p><p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""""><font><font color=""#000000""><font size=""3"">After a year of (successful) distribution in the French-speaking countries and on Amazon, I decided it was time to address the Anglo-Saxon world.

</div>","“Amalek. 

They left to save Israel. They landed in hell”

 www.amalek-novel.com 
Short Summary
My name is Thibault Verbiest and I am a Belgian born author. 
I was an attorney-at-law for 20 years, heading a well-known internet law firm established in Paris, Brussels and Tel-Aviv . 
After a burn-out that left me exhausted, I decided to radically change my lifestyle and to dedicate the second part of my life to causes and challenges that are more aligned with my true inner values. I am now an executive and team coach, a web entrepreneur (e.g. a crowd funding platform) and a novelist. 
My literary voyage began on a sunny Saturday of May 2008. I was biking in a disused Racecourse of a verdant commune in Brussels when, suddenly, an idea struck me, like a whispered breath, a crazy writing project.” Israeli soldiers being teleported to the Auschwitz concentration camp”.
I immediately felt the power of this simple idea. I was captivated. The need to tell this impossible story became irresistible. With passion, I immersed myself in dozens of books, films and online material about Judaism, Holocaust, quantum physics, Kabbalah, the subtleties of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and many other topics. Sometimes I felt stuck and overwhelmed by the complexity of certain subjects, then something unexpectedly happened, a providential helping hand, a synchronicity, an almost miraculous encounter, an inspiring coincidence. Like a colonel of Tsahal (Israeli army) who sat ""by chance"" next to me in a bar of an international hotel in Brussels ... Or a former ambassador of Israel who showed up in front of me in a train heading for Paris, after I I uttered his name the day before ...
Three years later I was writing the word “end” on Amalek. 
Like most French-speaking writers I sent my manuscript to several publishing houses in Paris and eventually I found my publisher a few blocks away from where I live, in Waterloo, in the South suburbs of Brussels…
After a year of (successful) distribution in the French-speaking countries and on Amazon, I decided it was time to address the Anglo-Saxon world. Unfortunately we found rejection from most literary agents and publishing houses  due mostly to my lack of having an established name in UK or US…
So I decided to take matters into my own hands and to begin Indie publishing my book in English (the first 7 chapters are already available in English, see chapter 1 below). 
In the meantime I have a lot of books to write and several projects to work on such as this one. 

What people are saying about Amalek


The book has been very well received in Belgium and Paris, both by the general public and the press (see my website www.thibaultverbiest.eu and http://www.amazon.fr/Amalek-mission-sauver-Israël-destination/dp/2930627514). More importantly, I received special acknowledgments from Holocaust survivors who were moved and impressed by the realistic and sincere description of the daily life of the prisoners, as well as the resistance organizations, within the Birkenau camp.
 Many readers were also touched by the spirit of unity that blows through the work, between the sons of Abraham, the quest of my life, contributing somehow to the reconciliation of the children of the Holy Scriptures, Christians, Jews, and Muslims. 
Thibault Verbiest guides the reader with pedagogy into the meanders of Sufism, the Final Solution or quantum physics. Written with the expertise of a veteran by a debut novelist... in short, this is a book you should hear about .
Yves Thiran, journalist (RTBF, Belgian Public Television)
A completely exciting and innovative fiction novel, mixing up with talent history, geopolitical, physics quantum and Kabbalah... A powerful story, a solid mastery of style and writing.. A reference of its kind, no doubt.
Sylvie Bensaid, journalist (Tribune Juive, Paris)
I just closed the last page of Amalek and I must confess I have loved this book.. By building bridges between peoples, you show that the Universal is the goal and therefore your book will remain remembered. I found in your fast and above all excellently documented narrative style the style  that I loved in Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins books....
Armand Broder, Belgian-Israeli lawyer

 
Synopsis of “Amalek” (700.000 characters)
In a Middle East in chaos, a fringe ultra-extremist Muslim Brotherhood sect takes control of an underground military complex located in Mount Sinai Egypt, where three portable atomic bombs are stored, ready for use. 
Hassan Al-Dawar, at the head of this fanatic group, has teamed up with U.S. General William Quaker, who is under the influence of charismatic televangelist Terry Gere, in a common vision to precipitate the End of Days. Al-Dawar and Pastor Gere both believe they have received a divine mission to hasten the parousia, Christ's return, a prelude to the advent of the Millennium.
To fulfill the prophecy, an atomic bomb must explode in Iran. Tehran will be convinced that the State of Israel is responsible for this attack and will have no choice but to retaliate by detonating a nuclear warhead at Megiddo. 
Operation “Holy Return” has begun. 
The sword of King David is stolen from the Topkapi Palace and the attack is disguised so as to suggest the involvement of the Israeli army. A nuclear plant in Iran is hacked by a virus whose code includes references to the Book of Esther, and the web is flooded with fake secret messages announcing the imminent destruction of the Shiite enemy and calling on Jews worldwide not to go to Iran. 
The plot reaches the Mossad and an emergency commando raid is mounted. The soldiers of the elite unit Matkal are trapped and all members are killed. 
A national crisis meeting is convened in Jerusalem. The Prime Minister recommends the use of nuclear weapons to destroy the Mount Sinai base but Beirach David, from Mossad, offers an alternative - to attempt an unprecedented operation: teleporting a commando to the Egyptian base using experimental quantum technology developed by the Research Institute Weizmann. 
The machine is a revolutionary type of particle collider conceived to create wormholes, tunnels in space-time. The work of the Institute is based on research carried out by Professor Bakal, a Jewish scholar who was detained at a secret base in Siberia and who was able to smuggle, through a quantum computer, the plans of the machine before he was killed. 
Beirach David is responsible for leading operation ""Amalek"" and has ten days to succeed. His first task is to recruit the nine soldiers of the commando. All are selected on the basis of mysterious kabbalistic criteria transmitted by Professor Bakal.
Four women are part of the commando: commander Leah Ben Gibor, a cold and cruel killer of Mossad; Sarah Shabtaï, a pacifist pro-Palestinian reporter; Iris Lahad , a beautiful and reckless Yemeni married to a religious Zionist; and Noam Melech, a lawyer of Ethiopian origin. 
The five men who complete the commando are just as eclectic: the arrogant Nathan Weisz, the son of a wealthy industrialist; Hussein Jibril, the rebel Druze; the intrepid Dr. Yuri Krassota; Tomer Haniel the kibbutznik, a paraplegic with an experimental exoskeleton; and Yankel Gnod, the soldier of God. 
After ten days of intensive training at a secret base in the Negev desert, Operation Amalek commences and the commando is teleported…but the destination is not the one intended. They land a few miles away from Auschwitz in October 1943, without knowing  why, and apparently without any possibility of return.
With the help of a Polish general they manage to extract from a neighboring camp, they hatch a plan to coordinate an uprising in the camp of Birkenau. 
The nine Israeli soldiers break into the camp of Birkenau and, through a network of Polish resistance, are assigned to strategic positions within the camp: Iris in Kanada, the area where the goods of the deportees are stored, Tomer in the Sonderkommando (crematoria), Yuri at the camp hospital, Leah becomes Kapo (a trustee inmate who supervises the prisoners) in the ""barracks of French women,” Hussein in the kitchen of the camp of gypsies, Noam becomes a Jehovah's Witness and works in the villa of an SS commander, while Yankel is a truck driver. Nathan and Sarah are disguised as SS.  
An initiatory journey to the heart of hell starts for the members of the Israeli commando. 
Maximilian Grabner, head of the Gestapo camp, has made it his mission to hunt down and eliminate the elite unit. The tension never ceases as he is constantly at their heels, a breath away from succeeding in their capture. 
The day of the revolt is planned for the first night (Erev) of Yom Kippur - the Day of Atonement.
Our nine heroes discover that each is predestined and linked to one of the spheres (sephira) of the Tree of Kabbalah. This revelation transforms them as they learn who they really are and their biblical destiny. 
They will then return to save their world and Iran. And enable the emergence of a new era…
 
What I Need & What You Get
Here's what I need the money for, in order of importance (that is, order in which they will get funded depending on how much money I receive):

A professional translation of my novel into English.
Proofreading - making sure those pesky typos don't make it into the final product!
Ebook conversion - paying for professional conversion to ensure the best reading experience for digital readers. Multimedia content will be added to the ebook that does not exist in the current French physical book.
Marketing campaign including sending out free digital copies to libraries across the US/UK and digital and postcard campaigns.
Press kits to send out along with review copies of the novel to as many reviewers as possible.

You'll see to the right what you'll get at each level, but here is a brief description of the various prizes available:
·         Digital copy of Amalek 


·         Hard copy of Amalek 


·         Your name in the special thanks both in the ebook and printed version of the book


·         Your name as supporter in at the end of the future movie “Amalek”


Your impact
The “duty of memory” is a growing necessity as the last Shoa survivors will soon disappear. Memory is not maintained only by history books. We must use the language and the means of communication of the younger generations. The digital novel is a manner to talk to young people. The Holocaust is also a universal tragedy and must be a place of memory for all, whatever their culture. By helping to finance the English version of Amalek, you contribute also to my mission, building bridges between cultures and uniting peoples for a better, more tolerant and more caring world.
The English book will be also an added value for the movie “Amalek” as producers are already interested in the story. A script is now being written and my Belgian producer (http://panacheproductions.be/  ) is willing to team up with US producers to make it happen !    
Other Ways You Can Help
You can also be a great contributor by helping to get the word out about my campaign via blog, FB, twitter, email, and the Indiegogo website share tools to groups and individuals you think might invest. I appreciate you spreading the word to anyone you can think of. Maybe a New York based publishing house or literary agent;-)

Chapter 1
 
 
On a meadow caressed by a cold dry wind leafy saplings danced in a synchronised waltz. 
Nature had been frozen into a deathly coldness by the early winter, and under a lowering grey sky nothing seemed to move in a lifeless calm except for the rustling of some dry grass. 
 Suddenly, a cry pierced the icy air and shadows moved in the sleeping stillness.
“Regroup, quickly!”
In a flash, four men and four women in combat outfits grouped themselves in a star shaped formation. Hunkered down and with rifles pointing outward like a giant hedgehog, they identified themselves one at a time. “Tomer’s missing,” exclaimed Hussein, his eyes fixed on the horizon.
 Before this strange assembly could catch its breath, a familiar muffled noise, like the crackling of a faulty loud speaker, was heard. 
In a split second, the mouth of a silver sphere suspended in the air a few metres from the commando began to grow, curving outwards. A familiar silhouette appeared from nowhere. 
The number seven, Tomer Hamiel, found himself face to face with his comrades stupefied by his apparition. And yet, only a few moments before, the same thing had happened to them! 
-          “Commander, where are we?” stammered Tomer. 
-          “No idea” came the reply, “but for God’s sake, keep calm. Concentrate and go to stealth mode”. 
By a recognition system of the Iris, and pre-defined movements of the eyes and eyelids, the inter-active menu flashed up the chameleon function on the virtual screen in the helmet of the commando members. 
Instantly, they merged into their surroundings of a green field the size of a football pitch surrounded by trees. Sarah Chabtaï mouthed into the microphone of her helmet: 
-          “Nathan you built this crap machine, say something!”
From the male point of view, Sarah was a smiling, smartly dressed, typical blond. 
No one could guess that an expert in counter terrorism and eventual pacific reporter, was hidden behind her freckled baby face. 
Nathan Weisz, the last minute replacement, viewed as a dandy, brilliant maybe but infatuated and arrogant, replied slowly and gravely trying to keep his temper.
-           “The only thing about which I’m certain is that we’re not in that god damned Egyptian base. Leah, we have to get under cover in the trees, and work out what’s going on”.
With a brief gesture of his head, Leah Ben Gibor the unit commander directed the members of the squadron towards the NorthWest and the nearest trees. 
With mankind’s inbred instinct to try and hide in a hostile environment, they all headed to the thickest clump of trees. Leaning against a solid birch tree in the midst of some pines, the Commander, Leah Ben Gibor activated his personal PC to check the onboard communications system linking the members of the commando. 
-          “No GPS or satellite signal was online. Incomprehensible! We’ll have to try a radio scan” cut in Nathan, who’d been responsible for communications in Tsanhanim, the special parachutists unit. 
He switched on and after a few seconds picked up some distant poor quality music. 
-          “Sounds like a waltz” murmured Nathan. “Keep looking” was the sharp retort from Captain Hussein Jibril, second in rank and deputy leader. 
There was a jumble of voices and suddenly an audible conversation. 
-          “Am I dreaming or is that a Slavic language?” muttered Nathan. “Yuri, do you understand anything of this babbling?”. 
In his helmet with holographic images on the visor, Doctor Yuri Krassota strained to hear. 
-          “Wait, I’m not sure, can’t hear very well, but, yes it’s Polish!”.  
Yuri Krassota was far away the oldest and most experienced of the commando. Ex military doctor in the Spetsnaz of the Russian army, he had emigrated to Israel seven years earlier. 
Not without a certain amount of difficulty, he had managed to be accepted into the very respected 669 unit devoted to search and rescue operations of wounded soldiers in enemy territory, or survivors of nature’s catastrophes.
Fearless, indeed suicidal, said some, Yuri was decorated for saving a little girl in Haiti, trapped under tons of debris about to collapse any minute in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. 
Lieutenant Yankel Gnod, third in rank, broke the puzzled silence to intone, “the Rabbi warned us before we left that God would not let our arrogance go unpunished. He’s testing us and”….  
A forceful “Shut up” was the response of the commander Leah Ben Gibor. 
-          “These comments are helping no one. We need to get on. Let’s find somewhere civilized and we’ll soon get some answers”. 
With a comforting gesture, sergeant Noam Melekh, his frail ebony face seemingly floating in an oversized helmet, discretely took hold of the wrist of Yankel who was smiling weakly. 
There was a world of difference between Commander Leah Ben Gibor, an angry Zionist and Yankel Gnod, a kid from Mea Shearim, the ultra-orthodox Jewish quarter of Jerusalem.    
Leah couldn’t stop himself from seeing as stooges these men dressed in black caftans called Haredim, literally “the God fearers” wearing beards and paper curlers in the image of their central European ancestors. 
However, Yankel had cut all ties to his domestic origins which rejected all legitimacy of the State of Israel, in awaiting the return of the Messiah, the only one according to their beliefs who could restore Zion. 
Leah had read the dossier of Yankel and was aware of the journey, which had seen him land in a unit of the Kfir brigade composed exclusively of religious Zionist soldiers and officers. 
Captain Jibril, the only Druze in the commando, lectured his troops: 
-          “Move as we did in training.  Each of you in his sector; first assault group on my left. Second on my right. Command in front. Move forward cautiously to the edge of the wood. Above all, keep a sharp lookout with your motion sensors”. 
After a dozen or so minutes the brush became less dense, and the soldiers began to see a glimmer of light through the thick curtain of pines. 
The right iris of Leah flickered, prompting multiple instructions on his virtual screen. 
-          “A field with fencing. The area’s inhabited. A building at 300 metres. It looks like a farm”. “I see three targets” continued Yankel in sniper position, his HK 417 rifle firmly wedged in the hollow of his right shoulder. 
Without a second’s thought Leah carried on, “Yuri and Iris go! Yankel and the others cover them”.
Yuri made a rapid sign to with his right hand to Iris, whose barely visible elongated face and pouting lips, betrayed an exotic mixture of Middle East and Asia, as was often the case with Israelis of Yemenite origin. 
He grabbed his Tavor assault rifle and headed the expedition towards the mysterious and distant farm. 
-          “Iris, you only activate stealth mode on my order. We have to economize our energy reserves as long as we can’t make sense of this mess”.
Adjutant Iris Lahad silently agreed, but at the same time carefully checking the technical information provided in real time by her onboard digital communication system.
Arriving at the level of the stable, first building adjoining the North face of the principal structure, the two soldiers paused to take stock of the situation. 
-          “The stable is empty, the owner must have taken the cattle out to pasture in a neighbouring field” whispered Yuri. 
They surreptitiously enter the main part of the living quarters of the building, lower down the courtyard along the south side. 
Behind the house an orchard gave way to open fields rising towards the surrounding hills. Yuri goes in first.  In front of him he finds a spacious kitchen with a large and heavy fireplace in white Carrera marble. 
The room was empty but the motion sensor indicates three people in the next room, no doubt the dining room or living room. Yuri calmly signals with his right hand index finger the direction to take. 
And with a murmur, “gently, on three we go”. Without a sound the soldiers burst into the main living room where a mother was serving some cakes to two children of between four and six years, sitting quietly with their white bibs tied around their necks. 
The terrorized mistress of the house, drops her tray which smashes on the floor whilst Yuri dashes over to prevent her from screaming. Just as quickly, Iris tries to reassure the children calling to their mother with terrified cries. 
-          “Please, don’t cry, we’re friends. You understand Russian don’t you?” What’s your name” hastily said Yuri in his native tongue, forcing a smile.  
With a trembling voice the mother replies Katrina.
-          “ Katrina, tell me where we are. What’s the name of this place?”
-           “Rajsko “
-          “ What’s the nearest town”?  
-          “Jaworzno  
Yuri is lost in thought. 
Iris asks in a questioning voice, which can’t hide her anxiety, “what’s happening? Where are we? 
-          « We’re well and truly in Poland. I must advise the others by radio. > 
 
The rest of the group arrives a few minutes later and an improvised camp is set up in the main body of the building. The Polish mother and her children remain seated around the table of the dining room under the watchful eye of Iris who tries to distract the younger of the two children with some simple magic tricks. 
Taking off his helmet, Yuri began his briefing to a shaky audience.
-          “If I’ve understood his wife correctly, the owner of this place is being held in a prison not far from here.The farm seems to be isolated so therefore we should be out of harm’s way”.
-          “Did she say anything else” calmly asked Sarah Chabtai shaking her blond hair free from her helmet.
-          “She clammed up when she saw the Star of David on the pendant of Iris around her neck. As if she’d seen the devil in person”.
In a learned tone Nathan added, “It’s profound polish Catholicism which still believes Jews poison the wells and performs sacrificial rites on children”.
Leah curtly broke off the dialogue.
-          “On the south side there’s a local road leading to a path. Yankel and Nathan check it out. As quick as you can, see if you can throw some light on this crazy situation. As we know nothing of where we are, Be very careful, safety first!” 
Yankel and Nathan advanced cautiously for about 20 minutes before the country path gave way to a macadam road. 
The two soldiers activated the stealth mode of their suits and went to ground. In the distance they heard the sound of a motor and two motor cyclists came into view followed by an infantry transport truck with a Mercedes star on its radiator. 
Yankel and Nathan could hardly believe their eyes. The vehicles were those of the German army used in the 1940’s, and the soldiers were wearing uniforms of the Waffen SS.
Was it a reunion of historical enthusiasts of the Third Reich? 
Having analyzed all the relevent information of the surrounding environment, the on board computer of Nathan locked onto an object: a sign post in front of a crossroads a 100 metres to the left.  Zooming in on the helmet visor a word became readable: Oswiecim.

hours with the boy who lived, hoping to be the man who survived.  I

 to the Caribbean — engaging in wacky hijinks, action, adventure, sex,

bathroom.  You see, the nurses at Stanford were obsessed with my bowel

<p>On January 1, 2011, I left my homeland of Canada
to embark on a yearlong travel project. But it was more than just a year of
travel – it was a series of twelve carefully chosen work-exchange arrangements
that allowed me to connect with communities and stray far off the beaten
backpacker trail.  </p>
<p>Since returning from my trip, I’ve written
a book that shares all the highs, lows and unexpected surprises that marked my
adventure. It’s called <i>The Traveller</i>. To
get this book into the world, I need a bit of financial backing. That’s why we’re here together.

<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Story</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>The Traveller</i> is a full-length travel memoir that recounts
the joys and disappointments of pursuing
a dream journey. Written with a bit of introspection and a heap of humour, the book is a literary snapshot of twelve
distinct global destinations. What emerges is a portrait of an individual trying to be helpful in a variety of volunteer positions and of all the people who subsequently
help him along the way.</p>
<p>Instead
of numerical chapters, <i>The Traveller</i>
is divided into twelve months. Each month is a unique story that builds toward
a larger personal adventure. </p>

<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Cost of Independent
Publishing</b><br/></p>
<p>In the same self-directed spirit of my
journey, I have decided to release this book independently. (For more
information on why I’ve chosen my method of publication, check out my article, <a href=""http://www.danielbaylis.ca/book-2/self-publishing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Why I’ve Chosen Self-Publishing, Or As I Prefer, “Team-Publishing.”</i></a>) Essentially, I’ve opted for a process that enables
certain creative liberties, but this process also comes with a price tag.</p>
<p>So what does independent publishing
involve? Here are some rough figures: </p>
<blockquote>$ 850  - Cover design by one of Canada’s top graphic designers
<a href=""http://michelvrana.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Michel Vrana<br/></a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">$1500 - Proofreading by professional
proof-reader <a href=""https://twitter.com/jennifermcfee"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer McFee</a><br/></span>$1500 - Typesetting (approximated)<br/>$3000 - <a href=""https://ic.fsc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FSC-certified</a> printing
fees with <a href=""http://www.marquisbook.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Marquis Books</a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<a href=""http://www.marquisbook.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/></a>$6850* - Approximate total for a first-run
of 1000 print copies</blockquote>
<p>But wait. Why is the fundraising goal of this campaign only $5000? Well that's the bare minimum needed to get this puppy into printed form! As an independent artist and entrepreneur, it's part of the game to invest my own dollars as well. Essentially, I think this project is cool, so I'm also willing to help fund it. But I can't do it alone. </p>
<p><i>* Not
included in this summary of costs are professional editing services. The editor
of </i>The Traveller<i>,</i><a href=""http://moniquejames.moonfruit.com/home/4578417801"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Monique James</a><i>, shares dividends in the book (which are projected to come in the long-term). I have it on good

""Daniel had the chutzpah to quit an excellent job, leave his friends and home to travel the world on his own. Tell me you aren’t dying to know his secret.""
- Canadian Living Magazine




Hello, my name is Daniel. I’m a writer, and I need your help to get my new indie travel memoir into the world. But first, let me tell you about a journey that I went on.  
On January 1, 2011, I left my homeland of Canada
to embark on a yearlong travel project. But it was more than just a year of
travel – it was a series of twelve carefully chosen work-exchange arrangements
that allowed me to connect with communities and stray far off the beaten
backpacker trail.  
Since returning from my trip, I’ve written
a book that shares all the highs, lows and unexpected surprises that marked my
adventure. It’s called The Traveller. To
get this book into the world, I need a bit of financial backing. That’s why we’re here together.







The Story

The Traveller is a full-length travel memoir that recounts
the joys and disappointments of pursuing
a dream journey. Written with a bit of introspection and a heap of humour, the book is a literary snapshot of twelve
distinct global destinations. What emerges is a portrait of an individual trying to be helpful in a variety of volunteer positions and of all the people who subsequently
help him along the way.
Instead
of numerical chapters, The Traveller
is divided into twelve months. Each month is a unique story that builds toward
a larger personal adventure.

The Cost of Independent
Publishing
In the same self-directed spirit of my
journey, I have decided to release this book independently. (For more
information on why I’ve chosen my method of publication, check out my article, Why I’ve Chosen Self-Publishing, Or As I Prefer, “Team-Publishing.”) Essentially, I’ve opted for a process that enables
certain creative liberties, but this process also comes with a price tag.
So what does independent publishing
involve? Here are some rough figures: 
$ 850  - Cover design by one of Canada’s top graphic designers
Michel Vrana$1500 - Proofreading by professional
proof-reader Jennifer McFee$1500 - Typesetting (approximated)$3000 - FSC-certified printing
fees with Marquis Books


$6850* - Approximate total for a first-run
of 1000 print copies
But wait. Why is the fundraising goal of this campaign only $5000? Well that's the bare minimum needed to get this puppy into printed form! As an independent artist and entrepreneur, it's part of the game to invest my own dollars as well. Essentially, I think this project is cool, so I'm also willing to help fund it. But I can't do it alone. 
* Not
included in this summary of costs are professional editing services. The editor
of The Traveller, Monique James, shares dividends in the book (which are projected to come in the long-term). I have it on good
authority that she would really love for you to support this project. 






The Perks of Being a Funder


Indiegogo projects are about exchange and
support—a hand up, not a hand out. And my project is no different. The most
exciting reason to toss a couple of dollars my way is to get your hands on a
copy of The Traveller. For a breezy
$25 you’ll get a limited first edition, print version of the book. For
those willing to up the ante, there are a couple of other titillating perks, such as prints
of the photographs I took from around the world, hand knit accessories (yes, I knit),
and maybe even dinner together!

And remember, no matter what tier you
select, you’ll get your named printed in the book as an official “Associate
Traveller.” That's right: YOUR NAME INSIDE THE BOOK.
(Think of the hot dates that will get you!)
So hop aboard this train, already.






Sharing is Caring
So you’re
a bit down on cash? No worries, I can empathize. One of the best ways to help
is simply to help promote my project. Statistically speaking,
you’ve probably got a Facebook account. It would be extremely helpful if you’d share the link to this campaign on your

<h2>SEGUIDA KIDZ - BRONX URBAN TALES</h2>
My name is <strong><a rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Steve Adorno"">Steve Adorno</a></strong>. aka / <strong><em>Stevie Beatz</em></strong>. Musician, Author. I was born and raised in the <em>Bronx in New York City</em>. I'm from a ""Hood"" called ""<em>The One Seven Four</em>"". That's where the <strong><em>SEGUIDA KIDZ </em></strong> Band originates. <em><strong>SEGUIDA KIDZ</strong></em> is based on my true musical life story about how I, along with my childhood friends, decided to start a band instead of joining the local street gang in our neighborhood. The Band begins to perform at block parties &amp; street festivals all over the neighborhood. They meet Mike De Mic , a fast talking but lovable music biz manager, and he takes them on an amazing and zany journey to the top!  The <strong><em>SEGUIDA KIDZ</em></strong> become the #1 Band in the world. It's the band's encounters with members of the <em><strong>Savage 88's </strong></em>gang from the other side of the ""hood"" that will take them on adventures of danger &amp; excitement. The band changed all of our lives forever. It gave us a sense of empowerment at a young age and also set an example for so many other kids in our neighborhood. Thru the power of our music, we showed kids that you could make better choices. You didn't have to be bullied into joining a gang or to sell drugs or doing things your mama told you not to do! This is an on going issue encountered by many young people around the world. Especially kids who grow up in an urban enviornment. <strong><em>SEGUIDA KIDZ </em></strong>confronts these and other urban issues with stories that will be based in the reality of my musical life growing up in the Bronx. </div>

<h2>
<strong><em>SEGUIDA KIDZ</em> </strong>Production Goals</h2>
<p>My campaign is to raise a <em><strong>$7000 Production Budget</strong>. </em>Contributions will be used to hire Top Professional Artists like the amazing Bronx Born <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1485481/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Dave Rodriguez""><strong>Dave Rodriguez</strong> </a> to draw &amp; bring to life my original <strong><em>SEGUIDA KIDZ</em></strong> characters. Dave's work in the world of animation over the years is well known throughout the Cartoon industry. I am honored to have this opportunity to work with this very talented artist. The budget is to be spent on <strong><em>SEGUIDA KIDZ</em></strong> storyboards and page design layouts for the children's book series, web comic book series, graphic novels, and animation cartoon webasodes. I myself will be composing and producing the <strong><em>SEGUIDA KIDZ</em></strong> songs and music cd's so you can expect lots of world beatz and urban treatz! it’s important for me to tell my story to young people and with the help of <strong>You</strong> and the <strong><em>SEGUIDA KIDZ</em></strong>, we can inspire them and teach them that they have a choice. They don't have to just ""follow the crowd"". They can ""follow their dreams""... like i did. The <em><strong>SEGUIDA KIDZ</strong></em>  will always deliver this musical message in a fun and original way.</p>

<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<div>
<h3>Here's the Breakdown:</h3>

<li> Funding of <strong>$7000</strong> is needed as a ""<strong><em>start up production budget</em></strong>"" to hire the artist needed for the creation of story boards for the animation cartoon webasode series and Page artwork for the children's book.</li>
<li>Come join the band with a three tier choice of levels for your contributions that will reveal unique perks (your name in the books credits, Signed 1st edition books, Signed art print, Signed music cd's &amp; more..) depending on your investment (<em>$25 , $100 , $1000 </em>). </li>
<li>if we don’t reach our entire goal of <strong>$7000</strong>, funds rasied will still be spent on production cost of the <strong>SEGUIDA KIDZ</strong> project. These funds will be added to the next campaign to raise what remaining funds may be needed for the project.</li>

My name is Steve Adorno. aka / Stevie Beatz. Musician, Author. I was born and raised in the Bronx in New York City. I'm from a ""Hood"" called ""The One Seven Four"". That's where the SEGUIDA KIDZ  Band originates. SEGUIDA KIDZ is based on my true musical life story about how I, along with my childhood friends, decided to start a band instead of joining the local street gang in our neighborhood. The Band begins to perform at block parties & street festivals all over the neighborhood. They meet Mike De Mic , a fast talking but lovable music biz manager, and he takes them on an amazing and zany journey to the top!  The SEGUIDA KIDZ become the #1 Band in the world. It's the band's encounters with members of the Savage 88's gang from the other side of the ""hood"" that will take them on adventures of danger & excitement. The band changed all of our lives forever. It gave us a sense of empowerment at a young age and also set an example for so many other kids in our neighborhood. Thru the power of our music, we showed kids that you could make better choices. You didn't have to be bullied into joining a gang or to sell drugs or doing things your mama told you not to do! This is an on going issue encountered by many young people around the world. Especially kids who grow up in an urban enviornment. SEGUIDA KIDZ confronts these and other urban issues with stories that will be based in the reality of my musical life growing up in the Bronx. 


SEGUIDA KIDZ Production Goals
My campaign is to raise a $7000 Production Budget. Contributions will be used to hire Top Professional Artists like the amazing Bronx Born Dave Rodriguez  to draw & bring to life my original SEGUIDA KIDZ characters. Dave's work in the world of animation over the years is well known throughout the Cartoon industry. I am honored to have this opportunity to work with this very talented artist. The budget is to be spent on SEGUIDA KIDZ storyboards and page design layouts for the children's book series, web comic book series, graphic novels, and animation cartoon webasodes. I myself will be composing and producing the SEGUIDA KIDZ songs and music cd's so you can expect lots of world beatz and urban treatz! it’s important for me to tell my story to young people and with the help of You and the SEGUIDA KIDZ, we can inspire them and teach them that they have a choice. They don't have to just ""follow the crowd"". They can ""follow their dreams""... like i did. The SEGUIDA KIDZ  will always deliver this musical message in a fun and original way.

 
What We Need & What You Get

Here's the Breakdown:

 Funding of $7000 is needed as a ""start up production budget"" to hire the artist needed for the creation of story boards for the animation cartoon webasode series and Page artwork for the children's book.
Come join the band with a three tier choice of levels for your contributions that will reveal unique perks (your name in the books credits, Signed 1st edition books, Signed art print, Signed music cd's & more..) depending on your investment ($25 , $100 , $1000 ). 
if we don’t reach our entire goal of $7000, funds rasied will still be spent on production cost of the SEGUIDA KIDZ project. These funds will be added to the next campaign to raise what remaining funds may be needed for the project.

<h3>I am on a mission to help women live on purpose, work their passion and practice prosperity!</h3>
<p>My name is Tai Goodwin and I am a coach, blogger, and author in progress. I've been writing Monday Morning pep Talks for the last three years. Every week I get an email from someone that has been inspired by one of the notes they've recieved. By putting together 52 notes, one for each week in a year, I am hoping to spread the inspiration to more people, and create more magnificent Mondays.</p>
<p>The ideas for the Pep Talks started back when I was a teacher. As much as I loved teaching, I spent every Sunday night in a panic attack - so just imagine what Monday morning was like. I started giving myself pep talks. Eventually I left teaching and dove into corporate America. From there I launched a coaching business while working full-time. Balancing life, work and business required lots of pep talks to keep me from giving up on the business and holding onto the day job. In 2009 I started sharing my pep talks with my friends via Facebook, then my blog, then my newsletter.</p>
<p>Now I want to share the pep talks with more people who could use a little nudge and inspiration on their own journey towards living on purpose, working their passion and practicing prosperity. </p>
<h3>About the Book</h3>
<p>I've written some new pep talks, and updated some of my most popular pep talks, and invited a few women who I admire and think are totally cool to contribute a pep talk as well. In addition to the pep talks, I am including monthly audio affirmations, along with inspirational quotes, and stories. The book will be available in digital format as well as hard copy.<br/><br/></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div id=""video-section""><strong>About 911: Voices from the Outsider Media<br/></strong></div>
<div id=""about"">
<p>In the immediate hours, days and weeks following the life-altering morning of 9/11, I received a flood of emails reflecting a broad spectrum of ideas. I saved them and have never lost sight of the significance of this body of sentiments, or the hope of one day publishing and sharing them with the world. That day has finally come.<br/><br/>Approaching this tenth anniversary of 9/11, I am feverishly endeavoring to publish these writings in an anthology entitled <em>911: Voices from the Outsider Media</em>. The book reveals those voices unheard through mainstream channels and includes personal accounts, historical facts as well as fiction, comic relief, inspiration and more. Penned and forwarded by everyday people and public figures alike, these entries encapsulate the moment, creating a powerful representation of global thought and the myriad expressions swirling between continents via the Internet - a tool we had only just begun to explore.<br/><br/>We have since seen an explosion in the Internet and are witnessing how social media has given birth to revolutions and engulfed our lives. But, in 2001 the Internet was still finding its way into people's homes; the breadth of its utility not yet fully defined. And, the general public was just beginning to exercise opinions through this channel; we were on the threshhold of the blog, circulating original thought and developing an understanding that we, the voiceless, could now be heard. We certainly didn’t start a revolution with these 9/11 emails, but we <em>did</em> heal and comfort, educate, inform, and in some cases, scare the bejesus out of one another in an effort to process this unprecedented American tragedy. <br/></p>
<p><em>911: Voices from the Outsider Media</em> includes over 100 selected entries from around the world. I gleaned the importance of these exchanges when a friend - not connected to the Internet at the time - asked that I print some of this out to share with her. It was then that I recognized the sheer volume and importance of the varied information that had invaded my mailbox. Whether I agree or disagree with some of it is of no consequence, the historical significance of this work lays in the fact that it renders an uncensored picture of a global society during the most life-changing moment in most of our histories. This is, on the subject of 9/11, an authentic record of the minority voice and an opportunity to thoughtfully re-examine the past 10 years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Bringing the Project to Life<br/></strong></p>
<p>Realizing this project has included long days and nights of editing and reaching out to contributors for rights and permissions. I have enlisted the help of professionals to help with book formatting, cover design and the production of promotional materials (including video and print materials). In addition, setting up the basic processes for book-publishing are underway; including securing the appropriate licenses, printing the book, building inventory, setting up distribution and marketing the project. With the content having been established 10 years ago, now it's just a matter of putting it all together and presenting it to YOU!<br/></p>
<p>People have to be paid. Product has to be purchased...and every step of this process has its costs. Funds from this drive will be used to support all of the above tasks, many of which are already in progress in an effort to launch the book before the tenth anniversary of September 11th. I realize I have set an ambitious goal - $5,000 - but, truth be told, much more is actually needed to bring this project to the market in the grand fashion it deserves. So, please feel free to be generous but, keep in mind, that every penny helps and will be used to make 911: Voices from the Outsider Media a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your support - I especially appreciate it in these tremendously difficult times.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About Your Rewards<br/></strong></p>
<p><em>While 911: Views from the Outsider Media</em> contains a wide range of expressions – from Petitions for Peace to calls for war – and I feel it is my duty to present ALL of these authentic messages, I also feel it is my responsibility to promote and highlight the positive; that which continues to be inspiring and life-affirming. With that in mind, I will be pulling out excerpts to create a collection of auxiliary materials for funders. In addition, all supporters will receive discounts on Omo Misha products redeemable for 1 year, will receive special invitations to all related events, and will be regularly updated on the life of the project. I appreciate your presence on this journey!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
While Juliet was working on her first novel she often felt blocked or was distracted by the construction going on in her apartment building. She tried to work at a major coffee chain, but it was usually too busy and crowded. She discovered a local cafe just a few blocks away which led her to find other great cafes in New York City. She began traveling to other cities and was surprised by the number of great cafes out there that weren't doing well because of lack of exposure.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>They helped her find inspiration and a quiet place to finish her novel. She wrote the book as a thank you to these indie businesses.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>With your help the guides will be completed and available for purchase just in time for graduation season. They will be sold online and in college bookstores; people will be able to discover these great locations and support small business owners all over the country.</div>

When living in a busy city or traveling to one it's often difficult to find a place where you're able to tap into your right brain's creativity. The Writer's Retreat team wants to bring you a listing of the best independent eateries in your neighborhood or vacation destination. It has a selection of the best cafes, restaurants and coffee shops for writers, bloggers and students.
 
The locations are loiterer friendly with great food, coffee and staff. The New York City edition has over 100 cafes listed according to the neighborhoods in Manhattan, Brooklyn, The Bronx, Queens and Staten Island. A collection of Inspirational Itineraries that take you to landmarks not often found in other guide books are also included to aid in ridding you of that pesky writer's block.

What We Need & What You Get
We've already published the New York City Edition and it is available as an ebook and in print. But we're working on the second edition with updated listings and a beautiful new cover.
We were approached by a traditional publisher who wanted to purchase the copyrights, but they wouldn't publish the guides until 2014! We want to spread the word now. And with your help we can!
 
This is a pre-order campaign. We need $5,000 to pay for the cost of printing and distributing the travel guides.
 
The other half will be matched by the tourism board. This will pay for shipping and marketing the guides.
 
So you'll get them at 60% off the retail price!

<p class=""p1"">For as long as there has been art, there has, for some reason, been a tradition of the artist creating in a mystical and shrouded space; isolation and aloneness seem to be prerequisites for true art. Fortunately, many artists have voiced their dissatisfaction with this model of creation, asking for a way in which the creative act becomes also an act of community.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Metanoia’s mission is to be an answer to that question. This literary and art magazine features works that were created through collaborations of artists across genres and art forms, both together in a physical space, or in online forums. The goal of these collaborations was to bring artists out of their dark corners where they work alone, and into a place where the collective intellect became a force that expanded the creative experience.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Oxford defines metanoia as a “change in one’s way of life resulting from penitence or spiritual conversion”. While Metanoia is not so concerned with repenting sins or converting spiritual beliefs, we are, through our publication, striving to change the landscape of artistic creation by inviting artists to create within and across their communities. The theme of our first issue is “sanity”, a topic we believe broad enough (and complex enough) to allow for a wide range of freedom and exploration during the creative process.</p>

While Metanoia is not so concerned with repenting sins or converting spiritual beliefs, we are, through our publication, striving to change the landscape of artistic creation by inviting artists to create within and across their communities. The theme of our first issue is “sanity”, a topic we believe broad enough (and complex enough) to allow for a wide range of freedom and exploration during the creative process.
 
Cheers,
The Editors
 
 
PS. We are striving to produce a high-quality publication that will be available to anyone who is interested in enjoying great literature and art. It will cost more than $200 for less than 50 copies of our first issue. We have international submissions, and the intellectual support of many people. Now we need your economical support to bring the project to life. Thanks to each and everyone of you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I can’t think of a mother who shouldn’t read it, whether you have a newborn or grown children, you will totally relate to these funny and heartwarming stories. This second edition includes 18 new essays from some amazing authors . . . </p>
<p>“If you are a sleep-deprived mom, or know one, this is a book you definitely want to read. I know my best friend with a new baby is getting one instead of onesies and baby bottles!”–Stephanie Marsh, We Don't Chew Glass blog.</p>
<p>“Delightful and inspiring . . . A sweet reminder that I’m not crazy for always being exhausted–-and that laughing about all the mess is a REALLY good thing. Thanks, ladies–-you nailed it again!”–Meredith Spidel, Mom of the Year blog.</p>
<p>“Highly enjoyed my advance copy of <i>Motherhood May Cause Drowsiness</i>. From funny stories, like Lea Grover’s 'Bedtime Lament,' to practical advice such as Newlin de Rojas’ 'Seven Sacred Sleep Tenets,' there is something for every mom in this book. Child induced sleepiness is something to which every mother can relate and it is reflected perfectly in this collection of stories. Every mom needs to hear that they are not alone and that is just what they will get from this funny and touching book . . .”–Bambini Travel blog.</p>
<p>“Those who are fighting the battle of sleep deprivation will more than relate to this collection of stories from the trenches. Annie Swingen perfectly describes the feelings of guilt and self-doubt in the 'The New Parent Guilt Trip.' Renea Dearing-Dijab humorously admits to judging others before having kids herself–-something most parents have done. There are plenty of laughs and commiseration for new parents that should get them through those wee hours of the morning.”–Bunny B.</p>
<p>“The stories are sometimes thought-provoking ('What Mommies Need: Hint: It’s Not Sex'), sometimes laugh-inducing ('Motherhood Drove Me to Drink and Pass Out'), and–-most importantly–-ALWAYS honest. This book is a highly-relatable, easy-to-digest read for all moms out there. Totally recommended!”–Jessica Burdg</p>
<p>“What could be better than stories from actual moms? Motherhood is a mix of many things. Keeping your sense of humor is what keeps a mommy sane! A must read for the frazzled mom who has forgotten to just laugh!”–Michelle Smith</p>
<p>“Each story is funny and really shows how Moms feel on a daily basis. TIRED! I loved Jessica Azar’s story 'Motherhood drove me to drink and pass out.' Any Mom that can weave vodka, Merle Haggard, and one great hubby into the same story has my vote.</p>
<p>“This book would make a great gift for any Mom needing a fun laugh and a dose of reality.”–C. Lee Reed, Helicopter Mom and Just Plane Dad blog.</p></span></div><div>

What We Need

Our goal is to raise a minimum of $1900 to pay the contributors between $15 and $100 per submission (depending on their submission).
If we don’t reach our goal, including royalties, we might have to prolong payment, and scale back the amount. 
If you cannot contribute financially, you can still help:
Write a book review of our anthology on your blog. Conduct an interview of the publisher/editor, Lisa Nolan. Host a guest post (from us) on your blog. (Contact us by email by clicking on one of the above links.)


Would you like to meet the mom bloggers, writers, and poets who contributed to the anthology? VISIT OUR BLOG HERE!


What others are saying:
“From start to finish, this book is a gem. I can’t think of a mother who shouldn’t read it, whether you have a newborn or grown children, you will totally relate to these funny and heartwarming stories. This second edition includes 18 new essays from some amazing authors . . . 
“If you are a sleep-deprived mom, or know one, this is a book you definitely want to read. I know my best friend with a new baby is getting one instead of onesies and baby bottles!”–Stephanie Marsh, We Don't Chew Glass blog.
“Delightful and inspiring . . . A sweet reminder that I’m not crazy for always being exhausted–-and that laughing about all the mess is a REALLY good thing. Thanks, ladies–-you nailed it again!”–Meredith Spidel, Mom of the Year blog.
“Highly enjoyed my advance copy of Motherhood May Cause Drowsiness. From funny stories, like Lea Grover’s 'Bedtime Lament,' to practical advice such as Newlin de Rojas’ 'Seven Sacred Sleep Tenets,' there is something for every mom in this book. Child induced sleepiness is something to which every mother can relate and it is reflected perfectly in this collection of stories. Every mom needs to hear that they are not alone and that is just what they will get from this funny and touching book . . .”–Bambini Travel blog.
“Those who are fighting the battle of sleep deprivation will more than relate to this collection of stories from the trenches. Annie Swingen perfectly describes the feelings of guilt and self-doubt in the 'The New Parent Guilt Trip.' Renea Dearing-Dijab humorously admits to judging others before having kids herself–-something most parents have done. There are plenty of laughs and commiseration for new parents that should get them through those wee hours of the morning.”–Bunny B.
“The stories are sometimes thought-provoking ('What Mommies Need: Hint: It’s Not Sex'), sometimes laugh-inducing ('Motherhood Drove Me to Drink and Pass Out'), and–-most importantly–-ALWAYS honest. This book is a highly-relatable, easy-to-digest read for all moms out there. Totally recommended!”–Jessica Burdg
“What could be better than stories from actual moms? Motherhood is a mix of many things. Keeping your sense of humor is what keeps a mommy sane! A must read for the frazzled mom who has forgotten to just laugh!”–Michelle Smith
“Each story is funny and really shows how Moms feel on a daily basis. TIRED! I loved Jessica Azar’s story 'Motherhood drove me to drink and pass out.' Any Mom that can weave vodka, Merle Haggard, and one great hubby into the same story has my vote.
“This book would make a great gift for any Mom needing a fun laugh and a dose of reality.”–C. Lee Reed, Helicopter Mom and Just Plane Dad blog.





About the Publisher/Editor

I'm a writer from Canada. With a background in English Literature, I've produced works both through traditional publishing channels and through Indie channels and my work has gained a cult following. Passionate about reading, and the advancement of literature, I have read extensively about every theory and genre that relates to the craft of writing. </p>
<p>I'm creating this campaign because I want to do something new and exciting for literature, but I need your help. But, in exchange, I am willing to give you something that money can't buy -- not under normal circumstances, anyways.</p>
<p>I have a brand new idea for a book. Whereas most writers pick a genre and then proceed to write in that genre, I've always admired the ones who struck out on their own, stepped outside the rigid limits of convention and, in the process, created a whole new genre. A brand new area of writing, an all-new setting and a whole new set of rules, which still inspire millions of readers and still encourage hundreds of new writers, to write in those new genres.</p>
<p>I'm talking about people like Robert E. Howard. He created the Sword and Sorcery sub-genre of Fantasy Fiction (thanks to which we have stories like Lord of the Rings and Conan the Barbarian) or people like Dashiel Hammet, who created the Hard-Boiled sub-genre of Detective fiction (like Sam Spade and the Maltese Falcon.)</p>
<p>These writers didn't just follow the crowd, they dared to experiment and think a new thought and in doing so, they expanded the limits of literature. And now, thanks to them, we have a rich, varied landscape of literature, that enriches all of our lives. And these are the people who inspire me. This is my quest. And I want you to be a part of that quest.</p>
<p>When you contribute to my campaign, you don't just help an artist and help to expand the limits of literature, you can actually become a part of literature.</p>
<p>I will write you into this novel! That's what I meant when I can offer you something that money cannot normally buy. I will immortalize you, in the very lines of this book -- the first pioneering book of an exciting new genre. I will preserve, in prose, your name and your existence, here on Earth, for all time to come.</p>
<p>If immortality does not appeal to you -- and I wouldn't necessarily blame you for that -- then you can nominate a friend, a family member or any other loved-one. You can give them ""The Gift of Immortality."" Now, there's the perfect gift for that person who has everything, wouldn't you say? You can't find a much more original gift than that!</p>
<p>The sub-genre I'm planning to create is a sub-genre of the Fantasy Genre. Back in the 1890s, a man by the name of John Kendrick Bangs invented a sub-genre of Fantasy that bears his name: Bangsian Fantasy. This genre has to do with the afterlife, exclusively. His creation of this sub-genre has inspired such modern, contemporary works as ""What Dreams May Come"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."" What I've wanted to do, for awhile, has been to expand this sub-genre. I've written Fantasy Novels; I've written Mystery Novels. So, what I wanted to do was to combine these two genres, in a Bangsian kind of way, and so make an all new sub-genre: The Afterlife Mystery Genre.</p>
<p>The rules of writing in this genre would be simple: It must take place entirely or mostly in the afterlife. It must involve the solving of one or more mysteries, as a significant part of the plot;  And it must be written in the style of Literary Realism.</p>
<p>Apart from the fact you are in the afterlife, it would be written in a ""realist"" manner. The effect would be as if you had walked out of your entirely realistic life, here on Earth, and into the afterlife, which is just as realistic. However, being the afterlife, it is entirely a mystery, where I imagine there are a great many mysteries to be solved.</p>
<p>I'm sure a lot of you can see, along with me, the rich potential for this sub-genre to flourish, given the endless mysteries to be imagined, in the afterlife and given the strong natural interest we all have, in the subject of the afterlife. I am convinced this sub-genre can flourish if it's done right and by someone who knows what it takes to make a new genre stick. I've studied the genre creators extensively and have studied what they did and I'm confident I know how to make a sub-genre stick. In fact, I already have the whole book written out, here in my head. All I lack is the funding I need to work on it, full-time.</p>
<p>And that is why I need your help. Depending on how much you're willing to give, you or a loved-one can get anything from a mention, in this new novel, to being featured as a significant character, in this book, as someone who directly affects the plot.  Besides immortality for you or a loved-one, you will be directly helping to expand the limits of literature and helping the cause of book lovers, the world over.</p>

<p>I have the book in my head, already, but writing out a complex novel takes time and dedication, particularly if I need to find places for many contributors, to interweave into the chapters and the plot, in such a way that I can still do everything I need to do, to write a compelling work of literature, that will make this genre stick.</p>
<p>To create such a master work requires a year, at the very least, and so my wants are simply to cover my expenses, for the year, so that I am free to devote myself to nothing else, but my writing.</p>
<p>The total sum of $20,000 (minus Indiegogo's cut) will be divided into 12 parts, of approximately $1,500. These will cover my monthly expenses (bills, mortgage, car, insurance, gas, groceries, etc) over the entire 1 year period, which I will be devoting to this new book. As a struggling artist, accustomed to subsisting on Macaroni and Cheese and Ramen noodles, I am not exactly setting myself up for a life of luxury. I am not looking to improve my station in life, by any means, by raising money, through this campaign. I simply want to be able to meet my meagre and spartan wants, as I work diligently to construct the masterpiece that will immortalize you and the ones you love.</p>
<p>One month after I have received the funds, I will begin writing and guarantee I will have the finished manuscript -- polished and ready to publish -- within one year of that date. The reason why I will take a month off, before starting the book is because I want to personally email every contributor, reminding them of what they have purchased and what rights and entitlements that has granted them. Once I have let every one of you know what is going on, I will feel ready to begin. I will also be giving regular email updates, to let everyone know how the book is progressing.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>What will I give you, in return? Well, I have six different varieties of immortality to offer you, all of which make a great, original gift to give to either yourself or a loved-one. For the full range of immortalities that I'm offering you, see the section marked ""SELECT A PERK,"" on the upper right part of this webpage.</p>

</div><div> <p>There are several very important rules to remember, concerning this campaign. 1. is the rules that will apply to you, if you choose to embrace the gift of immortality. and 2. are the rules of the genre, which I am proposing to write. It is important to remember both. Because, if you claim one of the varieties of immortalities above, then you will probably be corresponding with me, personally, to assure your part in this story is agreeable to us both, before publication. In order for us to work together on this, effectively, you need to understand both your rights, in relation to what PERK you have bought and also the constraints of the genre, which I need to stick to, in order to successfully launch this new sub-genre and make it stick.</p>
<p>1. Level 1 Contributor.</p>
<p>If you buy the $40 PERK, then you are a Level 1 Contributor. This entitles you to have your name mentioned in the ""Thank You"" section, near the beginning of the book. Given you are not actually included in the story, you are not granted any influence over the actual book. Although your generous contribution to the expansion of the genre and the cause of literature is gratefully acknowledged. Unfortunately, due to the extreme logistical difficulties it could present, and the many ways it could serve to distract from the writing process, we will not be offering any refunds, if you decide to change your mind about being included in the ""Thank You"" section. Although we will gladly remove your name, if you so decide.</p>

What will happen is that, once I have reached the section of the book where your name is mentioned, I will send you the related text and ask if this mention is acceptable to you. I will also ask you if there are any limited details you would like included (such as what city you're from or what you do for a living, etc). After that first correspondence, where you will be given one chance to offer limited details and offer a suggestion or change, then you will have reached the limits of your entitlements, as a Level 2 Contributor. After this time, you'll have no further opportunity to influence the book, in any way or correspond with me. I don't want to seem unsociable, but I'll have a lot on my plate and so I have to set limits, ahead of time, to assure this book gets written, efficiently. Please understand that it is the your responsibility, alone, to provide me with a valid email address, by which I can get in touch with them. If I am unable to contact you, with the email address given, or if you don't reply as you should, for whatever reason, on the first attempt, I will consider all rights and entitlements of your level to have been abandoned, by you. I will try my best to accomodate any reasonable request, although I do not offer any guarantee that I will accept limited details or suggested changes, wholeheartedly, and reserve the right to refuse them, if I feel they are inappropriate. Even if refused, however, you are guaranteed that you will have your name mentioned in the book. If at any time, you have second thoughts and decide not to be mentioned in the story, you will be reverted to a Level 1 Contributor status, and will be mentioned in the ""Thank You"" section of the book.

I may also reject a suggestion if I feel it detracts too much from the compelling features and other essentail story components that make a new genre style ""stick"" and become popular, based on my experience, within the public at large.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>With an unconventional campaign like this, there are a LOT of unknowns. As with the highly original inventors of a new genre, themselves, I'm boldly striking off, on my own, into an entirely new territory, where no one can warn me, from their experience, what pitfalls await me. Given that a campaign like this doesn't happen every day, it's impossible to know all the challenges that could come out of left field, but I've been racking my brains, trying to anticipate them. So here they are:</p>
<p>1. Too many names; too many characters; and too many protagonists.</p>
<p>In the pleasant, yet daunting, circumstance that I wind up with 1,000 minor characters, 500 major characters, 100 protagonists and 55 antagonists, I will be in an admirable, yet incredibly difficult spot! This would definitely be the ultimate challenge for any author, and would require every skill in my writer's arsenal and my most masterful attentions, for every single moment of that year! I would, of course, rise to the challenge, and attempt to fulfill every single obligation, faithfully and to the complete satisfaction of all 1,655 of you! </p>
<p>However, in the interest of fairness and transparency, I would utilize any extra funds I earn, in order to schedule more dedicated writing time. For example, if I earn 20,000, I will write 1 book in a year. If I earned twice as much, I will make this book a series and write one book a year, working through my list of contributors, chronologically. I will continue to do this, until I am out of money. I will ensure, and guarantee, that I will run through my entire list of contributors and fulfill my obligations to you all, even if it takes eight years and swells into an Octet series.</p>
<p>2. Not enough names; not enough money; and not enough time.</p>
<p>Given this situation, I will extend the campaign, within reason, until I have reached the goal that I need, to devote a year to this book. I am keen to ensure that all my generous contributors do get the chance to become a part of my novel, as planned. In the circumstance, however, that I have executed many campaigns, and it seems hopeless, and I give up the campaign, I will simply write a book of shorter length than I had originally planned. This novella will be as long or as short as I have earned the resources to create. However, this short format will make it more of a challenge for me to make it into such a compelling work that it successfully launches this new and exciting genre. In this case, however, all contributors will still enjoy the opportunity to be immortalized in a novella, rather than a novel. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you need time to think about it, that's perfectly ok. There are so many other ways you can help me, in the mean time, without paying anything.  </p>
<p>For example, you can help so much just by sharing this campaign on your social media. That helps me a lot, by helping me connect with the people who may be looking for exactly this kind of quirky gift, for a loved-one, or who may want the gift of immortality, for themselves! </p>
<p>Or you can help a lot, by simply following my campaign. Join me on facebook, twitter, tumblr, google+, Instagram or Vine to get regular updates. I'll be shooting videos every week or less, to let people know how the campaign is going and to thank those who have already secured their eternal place in this new work of literature.

</div></div>","My Quest to Create a New and Flourishing Genre of Writing Hi, my name is Alexei Maxim Russell. I'm a writer from Canada. With a background in English Literature, I've produced works both through traditional publishing channels and through Indie channels and my work has gained a cult following. Passionate about reading, and the advancement of literature, I have read extensively about every theory and genre that relates to the craft of writing. 
I'm creating this campaign because I want to do something new and exciting for literature, but I need your help. But, in exchange, I am willing to give you something that money can't buy -- not under normal circumstances, anyways.
I have a brand new idea for a book. Whereas most writers pick a genre and then proceed to write in that genre, I've always admired the ones who struck out on their own, stepped outside the rigid limits of convention and, in the process, created a whole new genre. A brand new area of writing, an all-new setting and a whole new set of rules, which still inspire millions of readers and still encourage hundreds of new writers, to write in those new genres.
I'm talking about people like Robert E. Howard. He created the Sword and Sorcery sub-genre of Fantasy Fiction (thanks to which we have stories like Lord of the Rings and Conan the Barbarian) or people like Dashiel Hammet, who created the Hard-Boiled sub-genre of Detective fiction (like Sam Spade and the Maltese Falcon.)
These writers didn't just follow the crowd, they dared to experiment and think a new thought and in doing so, they expanded the limits of literature. And now, thanks to them, we have a rich, varied landscape of literature, that enriches all of our lives. And these are the people who inspire me. This is my quest. And I want you to be a part of that quest.
When you contribute to my campaign, you don't just help an artist and help to expand the limits of literature, you can actually become a part of literature.
I will write you into this novel! That's what I meant when I can offer you something that money cannot normally buy. I will immortalize you, in the very lines of this book -- the first pioneering book of an exciting new genre. I will preserve, in prose, your name and your existence, here on Earth, for all time to come.
If immortality does not appeal to you -- and I wouldn't necessarily blame you for that -- then you can nominate a friend, a family member or any other loved-one. You can give them ""The Gift of Immortality."" Now, there's the perfect gift for that person who has everything, wouldn't you say? You can't find a much more original gift than that!
The sub-genre I'm planning to create is a sub-genre of the Fantasy Genre. Back in the 1890s, a man by the name of John Kendrick Bangs invented a sub-genre of Fantasy that bears his name: Bangsian Fantasy. This genre has to do with the afterlife, exclusively. His creation of this sub-genre has inspired such modern, contemporary works as ""What Dreams May Come"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."" What I've wanted to do, for awhile, has been to expand this sub-genre. I've written Fantasy Novels; I've written Mystery Novels. So, what I wanted to do was to combine these two genres, in a Bangsian kind of way, and so make an all new sub-genre: The Afterlife Mystery Genre.
The rules of writing in this genre would be simple: It must take place entirely or mostly in the afterlife. It must involve the solving of one or more mysteries, as a significant part of the plot;  And it must be written in the style of Literary Realism.
Apart from the fact you are in the afterlife, it would be written in a ""realist"" manner. The effect would be as if you had walked out of your entirely realistic life, here on Earth, and into the afterlife, which is just as realistic. However, being the afterlife, it is entirely a mystery, where I imagine there are a great many mysteries to be solved.
I'm sure a lot of you can see, along with me, the rich potential for this sub-genre to flourish, given the endless mysteries to be imagined, in the afterlife and given the strong natural interest we all have, in the subject of the afterlife. I am convinced this sub-genre can flourish if it's done right and by someone who knows what it takes to make a new genre stick. I've studied the genre creators extensively and have studied what they did and I'm confident I know how to make a sub-genre stick. In fact, I already have the whole book written out, here in my head. All I lack is the funding I need to work on it, full-time.
And that is why I need your help. Depending on how much you're willing to give, you or a loved-one can get anything from a mention, in this new novel, to being featured as a significant character, in this book, as someone who directly affects the plot.  Besides immortality for you or a loved-one, you will be directly helping to expand the limits of literature and helping the cause of book lovers, the world over.

What I Need and What I Will Give You
I have the book in my head, already, but writing out a complex novel takes time and dedication, particularly if I need to find places for many contributors, to interweave into the chapters and the plot, in such a way that I can still do everything I need to do, to write a compelling work of literature, that will make this genre stick.
To create such a master work requires a year, at the very least, and so my wants are simply to cover my expenses, for the year, so that I am free to devote myself to nothing else, but my writing.
The total sum of $20,000 (minus Indiegogo's cut) will be divided into 12 parts, of approximately $1,500. These will cover my monthly expenses (bills, mortgage, car, insurance, gas, groceries, etc) over the entire 1 year period, which I will be devoting to this new book. As a struggling artist, accustomed to subsisting on Macaroni and Cheese and Ramen noodles, I am not exactly setting myself up for a life of luxury. I am not looking to improve my station in life, by any means, by raising money, through this campaign. I simply want to be able to meet my meagre and spartan wants, as I work diligently to construct the masterpiece that will immortalize you and the ones you love.
One month after I have received the funds, I will begin writing and guarantee I will have the finished manuscript -- polished and ready to publish -- within one year of that date. The reason why I will take a month off, before starting the book is because I want to personally email every contributor, reminding them of what they have purchased and what rights and entitlements that has granted them. Once I have let every one of you know what is going on, I will feel ready to begin. I will also be giving regular email updates, to let everyone know how the book is progressing.

What will I give you, in return? Well, I have six different varieties of immortality to offer you, all of which make a great, original gift to give to either yourself or a loved-one. For the full range of immortalities that I'm offering you, see the section marked ""SELECT A PERK,"" on the upper right part of this webpage.


The Rules
 There are several very important rules to remember, concerning this campaign. 1. is the rules that will apply to you, if you choose to embrace the gift of immortality. and 2. are the rules of the genre, which I am proposing to write. It is important to remember both. Because, if you claim one of the varieties of immortalities above, then you will probably be corresponding with me, personally, to assure your part in this story is agreeable to us both, before publication. In order for us to work together on this, effectively, you need to understand both your rights, in relation to what PERK you have bought and also the constraints of the genre, which I need to stick to, in order to successfully launch this new sub-genre and make it stick.

Although your generous contribution to the expansion of the genre and the cause of literature is gratefully acknowledged. Unfortunately, due to the extreme logistical difficulties it could present, and the many ways it could serve to distract from the writing process, we will not be offering any refunds, if you decide to change your mind about being included in the ""Thank You"" section. Although we will gladly remove your name, if you so decide.

I will also ask you if there are any limited details you would like included (such as what city you're from or what you do for a living, etc). After that first correspondence, where you will be given one chance to offer limited details and offer a suggestion or change, then you will have reached the limits of your entitlements, as a Level 2 Contributor. After this time, you'll have no further opportunity to influence the book, in any way or correspond with me.

If, as a Level 2 to Level 6 contributor, you ever make a suggestion either in your character or the plot, which would violate the above guidelines for the genre, then I will reserve the right to refuse your change, no matter your Level or the otherwise reasonableness of your request. I may also reject a suggestion if I feel it detracts too much from the compelling features and other essentail story components that make a new genre style ""stick"" and become popular, based on my experience, within the public at large.

    Risks & Challenges With an unconventional campaign like this, there are a LOT of unknowns. As with the highly original inventors of a new genre, themselves, I'm boldly striking off, on my own, into an entirely new territory, where no one can warn me, from their experience, what pitfalls await me. Given that a campaign like this doesn't happen every day, it's impossible to know all the challenges that could come out of left field, but I've been racking my brains, trying to anticipate them. So here they are:
1. Too many names; too many characters; and too many protagonists.
In the pleasant, yet daunting, circumstance that I wind up with 1,000 minor characters, 500 major characters, 100 protagonists and 55 antagonists, I will be in an admirable, yet incredibly difficult spot! This would definitely be the ultimate challenge for any author, and would require every skill in my writer's arsenal and my most masterful attentions, for every single moment of that year! I would, of course, rise to the challenge, and attempt to fulfill every single obligation, faithfully and to the complete satisfaction of all 1,655 of you! 
However, in the interest of fairness and transparency, I would utilize any extra funds I earn, in order to schedule more dedicated writing time. For example, if I earn 20,000, I will write 1 book in a year. If I earned twice as much, I will make this book a series and write one book a year, working through my list of contributors, chronologically. I will continue to do this, until I am out of money. I will ensure, and guarantee, that I will run through my entire list of contributors and fulfill my obligations to you all, even if it takes eight years and swells into an Octet series.
2. Not enough names; not enough money; and not enough time.
Given this situation, I will extend the campaign, within reason, until I have reached the goal that I need, to devote a year to this book. I am keen to ensure that all my generous contributors do get the chance to become a part of my novel, as planned. In the circumstance, however, that I have executed many campaigns, and it seems hopeless, and I give up the campaign, I will simply write a book of shorter length than I had originally planned. This novella will be as long or as short as I have earned the resources to create. However, this short format will make it more of a challenge for me to make it into such a compelling work that it successfully launches this new and exciting genre. In this case, however, all contributors will still enjoy the opportunity to be immortalized in a novella, rather than a novel. 
    
Other Ways You Can Help If you need time to think about it, that's perfectly ok. There are so many other ways you can help me, in the mean time, without paying anything.  
For example, you can help so much just by sharing this campaign on your social media. That helps me a lot, by helping me connect with the people who may be looking for exactly this kind of quirky gift, for a loved-one, or who may want the gift of immortality, for themselves! 
Or you can help a lot, by simply following my campaign. Join me on facebook, twitter, tumblr, google+, Instagram or Vine to get regular updates. I'll be shooting videos every week or less, to let people know how the campaign is going and to thank those who have already secured their eternal place in this new work of literature.

<p></p>Over 40 million people in the gluten-free community deal with a range of issues including gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, wheat allergies, autism spectrum, and many other medical or personal health conditions. For most of us, traveling and eating out isn't fun. Instead, it can be difficult, time-consuming, and unhealthy. After traveling around the world and back, all while eating gluten-free, I am determined to change this. We need your help to create this valuable travel guide resource for the growing gluten-free community!<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/826682/files/20140901110047-IndieGoGo_Image-Paris.jpg?1409594447"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>
<b>Gluten Free Around the World: The Back Story</b>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>For me, going gluten-free after being diagnosed with celiac disease as an adult was both
a blessing and a curse. On the plus side, I finally knew why I had been living
with a stomach ache and related issues (celiac disease has over <a href=""http://www.cureceliacdisease.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/CDCFactSheets10_SymptomList.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">300
symptoms</a>!) for most of my life, and I held the basic information I needed
to get back on the road to health and feeling normal.</p>

On the downside, transitioning to a gluten-free lifestyle comes with a steep learning curve. Have you ever realized just how many foods are made with wheat, barley, or rye? Avoiding
these foods might sound easy, but in practice, it’s incredibly difficult, since it seems as though gluten is in everything! Like
all gluten-free eaters, I have to read every food label, maintain strict no-gluten rules
in my food preparation areas, and ask way more food-related questions than
anyone wants to answer.</div><div>
<p></p>
<p>And that’s just eating in my own kitchen! Eating away from home
presents a whole new set of challenges and requires hours of research and menu
reading, calling and emailing restaurants with questions in advance, and
structuring a lot of my day around food. (Well, that last part isn’t so bad.)
When I first went gluten-free, just the thought of all of the time,
effort, and resources that went into planning a trip with food restrictions was
enough to make me stay home.</p>

Fortunately, after a few years, traveling gluten-free has gotten a
little easier. Since I am a food and travel writer and editor by trade and an
explorer by nature, I love nothing more than learning about new cities and
cultures through food. I have become adept at seeking out healthy, safe
gluten-free food in all corners of the world, and for the past year, I have
written about these finds on my blog, <a href=""http://www.glutenfreejetset.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gluten-Free
Jet Set</a>. With this Gluten Free Around the World project, I’ll take this food and
travel writing to the next level and provide you with worldwide gluten-free
coverage in eBooks that you can access anywhere.<br/><p></p>

<br/><p></p>
<h3><b>Gluten Free Around the World: The Project</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Above all, this project is about the community of over 40 million gluten-free eaters, which, chances are, includes you or someone you know. Have you ever decided not to visit a city because you
couldn't find a restaurant with a gluten-free menu? Canceled a trip because you
didn't have the hours and hours to research safe places to eat? Had to eat
prepackaged snacks for every meal instead of risking meals out in a country
where you don't speak the language? These guides are for you!</p>
<p>Many excellent resources are out there to help people eat and cook
gluten-free at home, but managing a gluten-free lifestyle while traveling remains a major challenge. With the complete Gluten
Free Around the World guides in hand, gluten-free eaters will be prepared to
eat safe, delicious, and healthy food wherever their business or leisure travel
leads. Even better, since these digital guides will be in eBook format, they
can accompany you anywhere you take your mobile devices.</p>
<p>On <a href=""http://www.glutenfreejetset.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gluten-Free Jet Set</a>, I’ve already written about eating gluten-free in many popular
destinations, including New York City, Washington DC, Seattle, Atlanta, Paris,
Vienna, Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo. Over the next year, our team will visit,
research, and write about the gluten-free experience in many more locations
around the globe. Destinations that we plan to feature in the Gluten Free
Around the World guides include:</p>

<p>The complete Gluten Free

and regions around the world. The eBook will address challenges that travelers
can expect to face; relay tips for navigating the local cuisine; outline basic
terms and words in non-English-speaking locations; discuss region-specific
gluten-free products; and highlight a variety of the best gluten-free options
at restaurants, cafés, and hotels. The eBook will also tackle how to prepare to
travel to these various regions, including what to expect on the airplane, in
the airport, in the train station, and on the road.

<span>Each gluten-free city guide eBooklet will focus on a major city or
region. The eBooklets will include additional city-specific information and
recommendations. Each eBooklet will also feature a daily itinerary, with
suggestions for navigating the city's main attractions while packing in the

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The available resources in many Christian bookstores just do not provide the information that mothers need about breastfeeding. That's why I wrote this book. It is the culmination of 10 years of thought, prayer and waiting for the right time. I believe that this is the right time because of the resurgence of interest in breastfeeding and the focus from governmental agencies all the way down to local initiatives on helping mothers nurse their babies. I believe we will make a difference in the following ways:<br/></p> <ul>
<li>Evidence-based breastfeeding advice will take a foothold in churches that might have previously offered other less scientifically sound materials. As a pastor's wife and an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant with 20+ years of experience helping mothers and babies, I am uniquely qualified to write this book. <br/>
</li>
<li>Christian mothers will have a resource that encourages them on multiple levels</li>
<li>Mothers who read this book will be challenged to consider the importance of a personal, intimate relationship with Christ as a fundamental cornerstone of parenting.<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> As a previously unpublished book author, I have to overcome the stigma that is sometimes associated with self-publishing.. However, I think we have what it takes to successfully do just that.<br/></p> <ul>
<li>I am publishing with Westbow Press, an imprint of Thomas Nelson. Several years ago, my agent actually had a deal in place with Thomas Nelson. It fell through when Thomas Nelson cut the unknown authors from their backlist.<br/>
</li> <li>I had noted author Martha Sears review the book and give me her feedback. I took that feedback to improve the book. </li>
<li>My experience as a writer (numerous magazine and journal articles as well as a blog) and an editor (a parenting magazine), has prepared me for this project.<br/>

  Risks & Challenges  As a previously unpublished book author, I have to overcome the stigma that is sometimes associated with self-publishing.. However, I think we have what it takes to successfully do just that. 
I am publishing with Westbow Press, an imprint of Thomas Nelson. Several years ago, my agent actually had a deal in place with Thomas Nelson. It fell through when Thomas Nelson cut the unknown authors from their backlist.
 I had noted author Martha Sears review the book and give me her feedback. I took that feedback to improve the book. 
My experience as a writer (numerous magazine and journal articles as well as a blog) and an editor (a parenting magazine), has prepared me for this project.
 
  Other Ways You Can Help This book is the fruition of years of prayer and effort. I know that my work has just begun, and even if you can't help out financially, you can still be part of the team!

I have worked with beta readers and a professional editor in order to overcome as many of the reading issues as possible, personal preferences are considered unaddressable.
 I have spent an enormous amount of time making this as awesome as possible.

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p class=""Default"">My father has been incarcerated since I was 13 months old for the rape and murder of a young teenage girl. Although he pleaded guilty during the initial trial, he maintained his innocence with his friends and family through the first decade of his incarceration. Due to this, I grew up visiting him on a regular basis at the <em>Wyoming State Penitentiary (a maximum security facility – where the worst of the worst are housed)</em>.</p>
<p class=""Default"">When I was about 10 years old, my father confessed that he was in fact guilty of the charges against him and very quickly the possibility of “someday your father will be found innocent and will be home with us” was ripped out from under me. No more white picket fence for my future. </p>
<p class=""Default"">This, for fairly obvious reasons, was the catalyst for quite a bit of both internal and external turmoil in my life as a child and extended well into adulthood. In addition to the personal anguish felt, my mother was also personally broken by the news. Her inability to heal translated into a very emotionally, mentally and physically abusive method of raising me which inhibited my own ability to heal as I lacked a positive “model” for what a healthy way to process my life circumstances was.</p>
<p class=""Default"">Although currently there are more than 10 million children who have, or have had, a parent or both parents incarcerated – children with stories unmistakably similar to mine – to date there has not been a single one of us who has shined a light on the difficulties that circumstances like ours create in a no-holds-barred manner.</p>
<p class=""Default"">These difficulties often present in every aspect of our lives – friend, family, and romantic relationships; goals and aspirations; educational pursuits; career choices; physical health choices; personal faith and religious beliefs, and beyond.</p>
<p class=""Default"">While a small body of research does exist (statistical data, some case studies, articles, and the like), this will literally be the first book to detail what it’s like to grow up with such a stigma – the way the stigma manifests itself in everyday life situations – and how I’ve been able to heal from such deep seeded wounds.</p>
<p class=""Default"">There will be a decent amount of autobiographical information but I am not simply recounting my story year by year (the likes of “Shattered Silence” by Melissa Moore). Rather, <strong>A Murderer’s Son</strong><em> </em>provides a view from 30,000 feet of the battleground that those like me must fight our way out of in order to begin healing. To complement the painting of the big picture, I provide a zoomed in view of the <em>major hurtles</em> that are likely to be faced during the journey, underlining the pitfalls that are often encountered along with some best practices that can be employed to prevent getting <em>tripped up </em>or <em>sucked back in </em>along the way.</p>
<p>To ensure that <strong>A Murderer’s Son</strong><em> </em>is more than simply a one sided and biased view on the subject matter discussed, I have enlisted the cooperation and assistance of Dr. Denise Johnston – unarguably the world expert on the psychological, social and economic impacts that having an offender as a parent has on the child(ren) – and Dr. Vincent Felitti – the internationally renowned co-principle of the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Study, and I am including outside scholarly research whenever possible. </p>
<p>Additionally, while this book is not in any way an attempt to assert my own religious beliefs upon the reader, I would be remiss if I excluded the implications of my relationship with God, as I know Him, and how that has impacted my past, my current life, and my future view.</p>
<p class=""Default"">To ensure that all autobiographical information is recounted as truthfully as possible – avoiding personal bias and/or a skewed memory due to the traumatic nature surrounding some situations - I am interviewing as many key persons from my past as possible to obtain their memories of me and the situations that I am discussing. This research included making a trip to see my father, whom I hadn’t seen or spoken with since a very short one hour visit when I was 18 years old (12 years ago), to interview him.  You as the reader, get a front row seat to how that visit went and how it has affected me.</p>
<p class=""Default"">The motivations for this project are:</p>
<p class=""Default"">1. Reaching out to those living with the same or similar circumstances as me, in order to:</p>
<p class=""Default"">     a. Let them know that they aren’t alone.</p>
<p class=""Default"">     b. Help them avoid making the same mistakes I did.</p>
<p class=""Default"">     c. Provide them with hope by showing them that healing is possible.</p>
<p class=""Default"">2. To provide a resource for anyone who interacts with “us” (remaining parent, adoptive or step-parents, outside guardians, therapists, school teachers and counselors, police officers, etc.), especially pre-healing, in hopes of helping them understand what that child they are responsible for is going through and ultimately preparing them to help.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3. Be the first voice of brutally full disclosure – the initiator – of a global conversation on this topic.</p>
<p class=""Default"">Concerning #2 and #3 on the aforementioned list of motivations, coinciding with the release of <strong>A Murderer’s </strong>Son, I will be launching a website that will not only be a source of information and resources on the topics highlighted but will also include a discussion board that people around the world can use to continue the dialog that this book will be starting. It will be a venue that will allow myself and those like me (whom I term “peripheral victims”) to be themselves as they are provided a place to interact with others experiencing similar life circumstances. It will also be a place for professionals to go to gain a greater understanding of what <em>we </em>go through/are going through to enhance and improve their efforts to help us in the professional setting.</p>
<p class=""Default"">Although the target demographic of <strong>A Murderer’s Son</strong><em> </em>is the child(ren) of offenders, it is my sincerest hope that the impact will be much greater and the reach will be much further.</p>
Finally, while I do admit that this book and the journey I’ve embarked on to write it does provide a personal benefit – it’s fueling a strong and purposeful step forward in my own personal healing – my focus is on the reader. My focus is on getting the reader to a place of healing. To a place where no longer does a circumstance that they had no control over control their life. This is what <strong>A Murderer’s Son</strong><em> </em>has to offer. To write this book is why I am <strong>A Murderer’s Son</strong>.</div>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nationwide, more than two million children have a parent who is incarcerated in state or federal prison or local jail.</li>
<li>Children with imprisoned parents are almost six times more likely than their peers to become incarcerated at some point in their lives.</li>
<li>About one in 40 children have an incarcerated father.</li>
<li>More than ten million children have parents who were at one time imprisoned.</li>
<li>About one in 359 children have an incarcerated mother.</li>
<li>There is no one agency responsible for their welfare.</li>
<li>Anger, isolation, sadness, fear, anxiety and guilt are commonly experienced emotions for these children.</li>
<li>School failure, delinquency and intergenerational incarceration are common outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the above statistics, it's fairly obvious that the impact for a book like this is huge.  Not to mention the goal of getting the book into the hands of the more than two million children, noted above, but into the hands of the adults in those children's lives.  If even one child (or adult) is helped by reading my story, this project is worth every minute that I have spent and will spend on it and every dollar raised to get this book into the world!</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to prevent a larger publishing house from controlling the content or intent of this book (remember, I'm keeping this raw and real), I've taken on the task of self-publishing.  While I could simply put the book as a standalone PDF for download with a PayPal link on some random website, I think much larger.  The only way for me to stir up this issue (within the main stream media) and reach those I'm targeting to reach is to ""go big"" (because I refuse to go home)!  As such, I need help with the costs associated with publishing <strong>A Murderer's Son</strong> <em>the right way!</em></p>
<p>Some of the costs that I'm needing to cover are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional Editing</li>
<li>ISBN Purchase, Copyright Filings, etc.</li>
<li>Printing/Binding Costs (I'm going through Lighten Source)</li>
<li>Web Design for accompanying website</li>
<li>A Starting PR budget</li>
</ul>
<p>The above, along with any other book publishing/release only associated costs, is where your contribution will be applied. </p>
<p>If you're able to financially help me in this very personal mission of mine, take a look at the ""perks"" you will get (right side of your screen) at the various levels of support.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that some of you may not be able to donate money in support of this project, but there are still plenty of ways that you can help. </p>
<p>Here are just a few that I can think of off the top of my head:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help me to get the word out about this project - tell your family, friends, neighbors, the mailman, the manager at your local bookstore...even if they aren't able to contribute financially, they may have a similar background as mine and may want to read the book once it has been published.</li>
<li>Come back to this page often to find out where I am in relation to the ultimate goal and use the ""share buttons"" on this page to keep people talking about <strong>A Murderer's Son</strong>.</li>
<li>Follow the progress of the book on Facebook at <a href=""http://www.Facebook.com/MichaelShaneHill"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Facebook.com/MichaelShaneHill</a> and share that page with everyone on your friends list (especially if you're one of those people with four kadrillion friends).</li>
<li>Reach out to me personally (MHill@IHNPublishing.com) with ideas of who I can talk to, where I should spend extra time pushing this project, share your own story of healing with me, put me in contact with your local child/social services agency, police department, juvenile justice or probation department (if you have those types of contacts)...or anything else you can think of that will help me (1) make the book better or (2) help me reach my target audience.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>As IndieGoGo's instructions say, ""And that’s all there is to it.""  My goal is simple - to reach out to and help as many people as I can by sharing my story.  It's a difficult story to tell, even considering that I'm pretty far down the healing path, but if doing so can help others from going through some (or all) of what I went through to get to this point, I'm willing to stand naked on the proverbial world stage.</p>
<p>I appreciate all of you who even took the time to read all of this and thank you, from the bottom of my heart, if you're able to help me push this project forward - financially or otherwise! </p>
<p>P.S.  For anyone wondering how I have an ""@IHNPublishing.com"" email address if I'm self-publishing, I own IHNPublishing.com.  Part of the requirements to work with Lightening Source (since they don't work with authors directly) is that I had to establish a ""publishing company"" so I can sign contracts with them and establish my printing account.</p></div>","Project Summary

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>For over 40 years, <em>Maya</em> has been Drexel University’s 
student-run, undergraduate literary magazine, publishing student poetry,
 prose, short fiction and non-fiction pieces, as well as graphics, 
illustrations, photography and other art.<em><br/></em></p>
<p><em></em><br/></p>
<p>A past issue of <em>Maya </em>lists the date of establishment in 1962.  The earliest issue of <em>Maya</em> on record at Drexel at this time is from 1967, spanning all the way to 2000.  After a 6 year hiatus, <em>Maya</em>
 was brought back to life and has grown each year since from 
contributions of authors, artists and fans.  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Maya</span> continues to grow and improve every year, and this year we were on track to be able to publish a fully color issue of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Maya</span> 2011.  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Maya</span> is an entirely non-profit student group dedicated to expanding the importance of the arts across Drexel University.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Unfortunately, we recently found out that all of our fundraising cash was stolen, but our goal remains the same- to be able to publish Maya in full color this year and help it continue to grow as a well known and respected publication!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><em>Maya</em> provides the student body the opportunity to get their 
work published, and additionally, by having a student staff, we offer 
those interested in writing, publishing, public relations, and design 
the chance to gain valuable hands-on experience. By being both within 
and yet not run by the university, <em>Maya</em> creates an atmosphere of artistic freedom that allows individual creativity to thrive.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We offered our first Cover Contest this year to allow photographer and artists alike to submit their pieces to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Maya</span> to possibly become its 2011 cover!  With so many submissions for the Cover Contest, we want to be able to still showcase the pieces we receive that do not win, but are still captivating enough that we want them showcased in our publication as they are- color or not!  If we cannot fundraise enough money, we will not be able to publish <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Maya</span> 2011 as we planned for this year.  We want <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Maya</span> to continue to progress as a magazine, and becoming a full-color publication is a priority for the staff.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The ideal amount of fundraising would be $2000 to be able to publish a full-color Maya, as well as pay the winners of our previous Writing Contest (our money for this expense was stolen), and the winner of our Cover Contest.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This money will all go towards <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Maya's</span> publication or the payment of the winning writers and artist.  Publication of a full-color Maya is over $5000.  To be able to have color images spread throughout the book the cost of publication is about $5,476, while color images grouped in the center of the book is about $5,023 for publication.  We already received $3731.50 from Drexel University's Student Activity Fee Allocation Committee, so we set a goal of $2500 to bring us to $5531.50 for publication of the magazine, and $200 to pay three winners of the Writing Contest and one winner of the Cover Contest $50 each.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Publication is for 1000 copies of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Maya</span> 2011, which are distributed to incoming freshmen at Drexel University, freshmen English classes and Creative Writing classes at Drexel University, all Maya events held during the year, and all undergraduates at Drexel University through distribution in Creese Cafe and other Drexel buildings.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal of $2000, all money will still be applied to these two areas of needed funding: publication and paying contest winners.  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Maya</span> staff also holds 2-3 bake sales throughout the term to raise funds for publication, generating between $50-$150 per bake sale.<br/></p>

Hi everyone!  My name is Yvonne Fly Onakeme Etaghene and I wrote a book that I love called For Sizakele.   It's a soul-stirring, lyrically beautiful novel that addresses queer African gender, transcontinental identity, inter-partner violence and how we love as the ultimate illuminator of who we are.  I'm coming to you to ask for your support to publish it!
 
SYNOPSIS 


For Sizakele follows three women:  Taylor is a young queer, Nigerian college student in a passionate relationship with her girlfriend, Lee.  When Taylor develops romantic feelings for Sy, a new friend whose similarities to her make them instant-family, Taylor battles Lee’s jealousy.  As Taylor encounters challenges from Lee to her femme and African identities, she finds ways to define herself on her own terms.  Taylor’s journey to self-love and self-acceptance is punctuated and made possible by the kinship of the friends around her.
Sy, a Cameroonian photographer, is tender, big-hearted and haunted by heartache.  Her feelings for Taylor quietly blossom as the story of a former lover who smashed her heart slowly unravels.
Lee, a Black Boston native and basketball-playing pianist, grows more and more angry as Taylor’s activism and budding friendship with Sy leaves little room for her.  Lee’s hurt and sadness multiply as Taylor continues to neglect her.  Lee wrestles with the memory of a painful past.
Through interpersonal relationships, For Sizakele addresses transcontinental identity, queer gender and how we love as the ultimate illuminator of who we are.
 
 

Why For Sizakele Is Needed Now, Right Now



There are no books to compare to For Sizakele and that is precisely why my book is needed at this herstorical, literary moment.  I do not know of any novels that address first-generation African sexuality, self-love and inter-partner violence while using poetically lyrical language.  I do not know of very many novels about queer African women, regardless of the specifics of the narrative.  We need Queer African literature written from Queer African perspectives and we don’t have them.  Most of the time, these stories are shared over kitchen tables, between friends, in our imagination, at a performance or event, at political organizational meetings but, to my knowledge, we don’t have very many Queer African stories in literature.  This is why the time for this book is now.
This book is writing into existence my own life and truth and the lives and truths of many others whose stories are beautiful and powerful yet ignored.

<li>
<p><b><i><u>About Me</u></i></b></p>
<p>  My name is Ron Craft,
I am a former US Air Force Crew Chief and I want to share with you an
unbelievable true story of a mid-air rescue attempt that I witnessed firsthand.
This mission occurred in 1983 when I was a young Airman. I was the Assistant
Crew Chief on this flight along with Crew Chief Mike Bouchard. I could not
believe when we got the call to help this fighter over the icy Atlantic Ocean. It
was made the cover story of the military newspapers “The Stars And Stripes” and “Airmen
Magazine”. Those articles also featured acknowledgements and awards for the
flight crews. I have been writing this book for about 12 years, and now is the
time to get it published. These brave men deserve to have their story told and with
your help we can make that happen. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><u>About the Book</u></b></p>
<p>What started out as a normal eight-hour,
forty minute flight to England in an F-4E, 26,000 feet over the icy Atlantic
Ocean, soon turned into a harrowing day that would go down in the annals of Air
Force history. It would bring and prove true heroism among its participants. It
would take the skill of 3 air crews including a KC135A refueling tanker to
rescue an imperiled F-4 crew from those icy waters.  About 4 hours into the mission each of the 24
F-4’s heading to Europe that day had refueled 4 times. Major Alexander, call
sign “Ghost” brought his F-4 in for the 5<sup>th</sup> time. He then coined a
phrase that will never be forgotten by any of us, he said “We are fat dumb and
happy” because the sun was shining and the aircraft was running great. </p>
<p>  <b>Then, all hell broke loose!</b></p>
<p>What happened next defies all logic while at the same time exemplifying
the courage and heroism that our servicemen and women display every single day.  The mid-air rescue, which occurred that day,
had only been attempted one time before, during the Korean War.  It is a maneuver that one cannot prepare,
train or practice for.  One can only
describe this event as </p>
<p>“<b>Hell Over High Water</b>”.<b>  </b></p>
<p>This book is based on a true story
packed with actual events, real characters, thrilling details, and edge of your
seat suspense. This story is not just about the rescue attempt itself but also
a dramatic retelling of the unforeseen circumstances and events leading up to
the main event. This story showcases the courage and heroism that our service
men and women display every day. </p>
<p><b><u>Importance </u></b><b><u>to </u></b><b><u>Me</u></b></p>
<p>Ever since the night of this
amazing rescue, I have wanted to share this story with the world. I have been
working on this story for the better part of the past 12 years. The flight
crews displayed such bravery and professionalism, it inspired me as a young
Airman and continues to inspire me to this day. Though they were accommodated
and rewarded for their acts, it is only fitting that the flight crews receive the
full recognition they deserve. This is one of countless stories that depict the
lengths that our military men and women demonstrate without recognition. Too
often do the efforts of our nation’s bravest men and women go unnoticed. With
this book I aim to remind Americans why we need to go out of our way to thank a
veteran. </p>

are just a part of their job and not looking for any recognition. This is
why this book and upcoming movie will be dedicated to all of our past and
present service men and women for their selfless bravery. If you choice to pledge to my campaign or not

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p>Catkins in July is a book about a girl attempting to climb the ladder at her job while she grapples with the harsh reality of her past. As she moves into adulthood, even though she wants success, she realizes the strenuousness of independence and battles her expectations with reality.<br/><br/>My name is Alicia Tacoronte and I am the author of Catkins in July. I wrote this book because for one, I always knew I wanted to publish. I was drawn to the intoxication of watching someone read my words from a very young age. This particular book was made to depict the duality of mental health. A lot of successful creatives, from painters to comedians, have to manage their mental health, and all too often, the day-to-day struggle and their success are not connected. Mental health is usually looked at through one lens: weakness. It’s not weakness or strength but a lens itself. It is who someone is mixed with all of the delicate intricacies of what differentiates us from the next person. It’s a color in a vast pallet.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, my readers understand the struggle of how mental health can make someone the hero and villain in their own story — which makes it hard to conceptualize as a part of you. I want you to see this book as a gateway to understanding that self-acceptance is the most freeing form of success there is. <br/><br/>The world my characters live in is our world. And even though everything about their setting is normal, how my characters interact with each other, themselves, and people should (hopefully) cause readers to see subtleties in their own life. My characters go on a journey of discovering what being alone with yourself means and how willing you have to be to forgive yourself for past attacks, arguments, and mistakes because when you are attempting to move forward in your life, you tend to have to walk past your skeletons to get to the next door.<br/><br/>Catkins in July speaks to young adults and over-thinkers who want to grapple with understanding someone’s place in the world and the fear that comes with growing up.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Catkins in July inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are you?</li>
<li>What is happiness and how do we get there?</li>
<li>What does it mean to be an imposter?</li>
</ul>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing young adulthood will change us all for the better. <br/> <h2>The Book - <i>Catkins in July</i>
</h2>Catkins in July is written in 4 parts that follow the seasons and accompany Sarah and Cal’s first year living together. Each season shifts into a new mindset, a new goal, a new issue. As the characters adapt, so do the readers, and hopefully, by Spring, they too will have a new outlook on themselves.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<p>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April, 2021.</p>
<p>The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</p>
<p>The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</p>
<p>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</p>
<p>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring.</p>
<br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.<br/><br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<p>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.</p>
<p>Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.</p>
<p>You will receive early access to the Author’s Note and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.</p>
<p>You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.</p>
<p>You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.</p>
<p>And much more!</p> <h2>About the Author</h2>Alicia Tacoronte is a recent Georgetown University McDonough School of Business graduate, majoring in management with a minor in creative writing. She currently works as a human resources professional but decided to chase a lifelong dream of publishing during the pandemic. Oftentimes, Alicia describes writing as someone else might describe breathing: vital to her existence. It is what allows her to enegage in life in a meaningful way, and see the beauty in its nuances.<br/><br/>Alicia set out to write a book showcasing the duality of mental health. “As someone who has dealt with mental health, it is frustrating to see stories that have characters whose one thing I relate to be struggle. It is as if there isn’t any other attribute than their mental illness,” Alicia explains. “I wanted to write a book with a protagonist that everyone can relate to, see themselves in, root for...to create a character I wish I had more access to.” <br/><br/>Alicia loves to explore new things, with a specific emphasis on food and adrenaline. She is always one to try any type of food at least once and has found herself spontaneously self-bungee jumping and cave crawling. She has an 18-year-old cat Jenny who has been with her most of her life.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Alicia Tacoronte at tacoronte.alicia@gmail.com and on instagram (@author_alicia_tacoronte), Facebook, and LinkedIn.<br/> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. <br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.<br/> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:<p>Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network.

They tried something that had never been done before in an industry that isn’t accepting applications and turned that into a successful business.<br/><br/>In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the women in this book who have taken a chance on themselves and built huge brands that people all over the world know and love today. Ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you grow your own brand, or even get a better idea on how digital marketing has evolved and how it can apply to you and your life - how it can inspire you to grow a billion dollar business.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about many women's stories including:</p><ul>
<li>Emily Weiss, the founder and CEO of glossier who created a cosmetics line that is valued at $1.2 billion</li>
<li>Pat McGrath, one of the most influential and sought-after make-up artists in the world who developed a luxury cosmetics brand and spent 10 seasons creating make-up concepts for Prada and Miu Miu</li>
<li>Sophia Amoruso, the founder of Nasty Gal, bored at her job started an online eBay store called Nasty Gal that went on to sell for $20 million—let’s not forget that she pretty much created the term “girl boss” that a lot of us women use in every day life.</li>
</ul><p>You will love this book if you love reading and learning about other women's success stories and how they paved their own path in the beauty and fashion industry. If you love social media and digital marketing, then you'll love reading how these women tapped into digital in their own ways and maximized their efforts building billion dollar companies.<br/><br/>Voguepreneurs is a non-fiction book that speaks to aspiring women influencers and entrepreneurs who are looking at methods and techniques other women have used to break into the beauty and fashion space. If you’re looking to break out on your own and start your own company, this book is filled with creative digital campaigns from women of all different backgrounds that can give you the inspiration and push you need to build your own brand through social media for the first time.</p><p> </p><h2>The Book - Voguepreneurs</h2><p><br/>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the Introduction + Chapters 1-5. The first section of my book walks you though the history of digital platforms and how Hollywood socialites transformed from “it girls” to “digital influencers.” We dive into the story of Paris Hilton and how she helped write the script on how to build a brand through social media and set up the precedent for everyone to exist in the internet-driven world. The modern day ideas of celebrities, how brands market on social media, the way we think about influence. How brick and mortar stores have turned into digital storefronts within our fingertips.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 6-9. While capturing this research, I realized these women had built empires within the beauty and fashion space making new and innovative ways to market on social media and I wanted to know how they did it. Every one of them had a different angle yet used this same formula to transform their brand into a full time business. I like to call it The 4S Process, which includes:</p><p> </p><ul>

<li>How did these women leverage social media to build a community?</li>
<li>What was their secret sauce - what made them different and stand out among a sea of wannabes?</li>
<li>How they grew their brand to gain the level of success they had.</li>
</ul><p><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 10-12. This is where I wrap everything up and discuss the future of digital marketing. Being connected and on digital platforms is more important than ever before. What does this look like for future vogueprenerus? Going through a pandemic (COVID 19) has definitely shown all of us that if you’re not on any digital platform or providing some connection through them in this day in age, you likely won’t make it.</p><p> </p><h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2><p><br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h3><strong>Why a Review of Books?</strong></h3>
<p>At Yale, where we are based, our generation has been hesitant to engage in this kind of venture. Very little of the writing that students do outside the classroom is both rigorous and argumentative, and very little inside the classroom is accessible to those outside it. Brink unites the highest editorial standards with the highest intellectual expectations—a combination of the literary skill that students show in campus publications with the ambition they show in their academic work. We hope that this will allow our generation to think through – and write for – the world we are about to inherit.</p>
<p>Brink will publish three issues per year. Our essays will engage with topics of importance on campus and beyond. Instead of taking submissions, our group of editors will select our contributors with assistance from professors in the relevant field. Writers will be encouraged to range broadly on their topics. The only requirement is that they write and argue well.</p>
<h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Founding Editors</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Adler </strong>is a senior at Yale, where he studies history and philosophy. His scholarly work has appeared in the journal <i>Jewish Historical Studies</i>. </p>
<p><strong>Daniel Judt</strong> is a senior at Yale, where he majors in history. He has interned at <i>The New York Review of Books</i> and is a contributor to <i>The Nation</i>, <i>The Point</i>, and <i>Southern Cultures</i>, among others. </p>
<p><strong>Max Norman</strong> is a senior at Yale, majoring in Comparative Literature. He writes cultural criticism for the <i>Yale Daily News</i> and <i>The Point</i>. </p>
<p><strong>Managing Editors</strong></p>
<p><strong>Molly Montgomery </strong>is a junior at Yale, studying philosophy. She’s currently working on a series of essays about trade and time in New Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>Graham Ambrose</strong> is a senior at Yale, where he studies history. He has written about politics, music, and culture for <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>The Denver Post</i>, and <i>The Providence Journal</i>, among others.</p>
<p><strong>Sergio Infante </strong>is a senior at Yale, where he majors in history. He has received various academic prizes for his scholarship, and has contributed pieces to the <i>Yale Review of International Studies</i>, <i>Accent </i><i>Magazine</i> and <i>Art, Lux et Veritas</i>.</p>
<p>Our <strong>faculty advisory board</strong> consists of ten Yale faculty members who will provide editorial guidance, as well as a source of recommendations for books to review and students to review them.</p>
<p>Jennifer Allen, Assistant Professor of History</p>
<p>David Blight, Class of 1954 Professor of American History</p>
<p>David Bromwich, Sterling Professor of English</p>
<p>Peter Cole, Horace W. Goldsmith Senior Lecturer of Judaic Studies and Comparative Literature</p>
<p>Beverly Gage, Professor of History; Brady-Johnson Professor of Grand Strategy</p>
<p>Glenda Gilmore, Peter V &amp; C Vann Woodward Professor of History</p>
<p>Marci Shore, Associate Professor of History</p>
<p>Timothy Snyder, Richard C. Levin Professor of History</p>
<p>David Sorkin, Lucy G. Moses Professor of Modern Jewish History</p>
<p>Michael Warner, Seymour H. Knox Professor of English, Professor of American Studies</p>
<h3><strong>What’s Inside</strong></h3>
<p>Our issues will be wide-ranging, with pieces on campus affairs, American and international politics, science and technology, and contemporary literature. For example, our first issue will feature essays on identity politics and the American left (Mark Lilla’s The Once and Future Liberal); the geopolitics of mapmaking in the age of GPS (William Rankin’s After the Map, and others); the question of how best to historicize Donald Trump (Timothy Snyder’s On Tyranny); the future of environmental law and policy (Jedediah Purdy’s After Nature); and a reconsideration of the category of Blackness (Achille Mbembe’s Critique of Black Reason). Alongside student essays, every issue of Brink will feature one essay written by a professor at Yale. Our first faculty contributor will be David Bromwich. </p>
<h3><strong>By the Numbers </strong></h3>
<p>The primary expense for Brink will be its publication in print. We estimate that each issue will cost $1200, and we plan at least three issues per academic year. A smaller but equally important expense will be graphic design. We are working with two recent Yale graduates to develop Brink's visual identity - as well as a template that we can use across all issues and on the Brink website. Other unforeseen expenses may arise, but in total, yearly costs should come to no more than $4000.</p>
<p>We hope that Brink and its mission will generate excitement not only within the Yale community, but also among Yale alumni/ae and the general public readership. <strong>This is where you come in</strong>. We are running this Indiegogo campaign to ensure that Brink can sustain itself over both the short and long-term, and that we can expand as we see fit. Your donations will also help to provide a financial safety net for Brink, so that the project is not only dependent on Yale grants for its continued success.</p>

</div></div>","Why a Review of Books?
At Yale, where we are based, our generation has been hesitant to engage in this kind of venture. Very little of the writing that students do outside the classroom is both rigorous and argumentative, and very little inside the classroom is accessible to those outside it. Brink unites the highest editorial standards with the highest intellectual expectations—a combination of the literary skill that students show in campus publications with the ambition they show in their academic work. We hope that this will allow our generation to think through – and write for – the world we are about to inherit.
Brink will publish three issues per year. Our essays will engage with topics of importance on campus and beyond. Instead of taking submissions, our group of editors will select our contributors with assistance from professors in the relevant field. Writers will be encouraged to range broadly on their topics. The only requirement is that they write and argue well.
Who We Are
Founding Editors
Jonathan Adler is a senior at Yale, where he studies history and philosophy. His scholarly work has appeared in the journal Jewish Historical Studies. 
Daniel Judt is a senior at Yale, where he majors in history. He has interned at The New York Review of Books and is a contributor to The Nation, The Point, and Southern Cultures, among others. 
Max Norman is a senior at Yale, majoring in Comparative Literature. He writes cultural criticism for the Yale Daily News and The Point. 
Managing Editors
Molly Montgomery is a junior at Yale, studying philosophy. She’s currently working on a series of essays about trade and time in New Mexico.
Graham Ambrose is a senior at Yale, where he studies history. He has written about politics, music, and culture for The Washington Post, The Denver Post, and The Providence Journal, among others.
Sergio Infante is a senior at Yale, where he majors in history. He has received various academic prizes for his scholarship, and has contributed pieces to the Yale Review of International Studies, Accent Magazine and Art, Lux et Veritas.
Our faculty advisory board consists of ten Yale faculty members who will provide editorial guidance, as well as a source of recommendations for books to review and students to review them.
Jennifer Allen, Assistant Professor of History
David Blight, Class of 1954 Professor of American History
David Bromwich, Sterling Professor of English
Peter Cole, Horace W. Goldsmith Senior Lecturer of Judaic Studies and Comparative Literature
Beverly Gage, Professor of History; Brady-Johnson Professor of Grand Strategy
Glenda Gilmore, Peter V & C Vann Woodward Professor of History
Marci Shore, Associate Professor of History
Timothy Snyder, Richard C. Levin Professor of History
David Sorkin, Lucy G. Moses Professor of Modern Jewish History
Michael Warner, Seymour H. Knox Professor of English, Professor of American Studies
What’s Inside
Our issues will be wide-ranging, with pieces on campus affairs, American and international politics, science and technology, and contemporary literature. For example, our first issue will feature essays on identity politics and the American left (Mark Lilla’s The Once and Future Liberal); the geopolitics of mapmaking in the age of GPS (William Rankin’s After the Map, and others); the question of how best to historicize Donald Trump (Timothy Snyder’s On Tyranny); the future of environmental law and policy (Jedediah Purdy’s After Nature); and a reconsideration of the category of Blackness (Achille Mbembe’s Critique of Black Reason). Alongside student essays, every issue of Brink will feature one essay written by a professor at Yale. Our first faculty contributor will be David Bromwich. 
By the Numbers 
The primary expense for Brink will be its publication in print. We estimate that each issue will cost $1200, and we plan at least three issues per academic year. A smaller but equally important expense will be graphic design. We are working with two recent Yale graduates to develop Brink's visual identity - as well as a template that we can use across all issues and on the Brink website. Other unforeseen expenses may arise, but in total, yearly costs should come to no more than $4000.
We hope that Brink and its mission will generate excitement not only within the Yale community, but also among Yale alumni/ae and the general public readership. This is where you come in. We are running this Indiegogo campaign to ensure that Brink can sustain itself over both the short and long-term, and that we can expand as we see fit. Your donations will also help to provide a financial safety net for Brink, so that the project is not only dependent on Yale grants for its continued success.

<h3>Meet the poet:</h3>
<p>Hi everyone! Thanks for visiting my IndieGoGo page. This poetry chapbook, ""Under the Moon as My Sun,"" consists of some of my favorite poems that I have written throughout the past few years. I really hope that you enjoy reading my poetry! <br/> </p>
<h3>About My Poetry Past:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>First, I often compete at open poetry contests. It's thrilling, yet scary to be in front of an audience reading poems that I have crafted. The idea that one's written words can have such a profound impact is very special to me. My awards and distinctions to date include second place at the Main Street Voices Poetry Contest and runner-up (by one point!) at the 100 Thousand Poets for Change Poetry Slam, hosted by Montgomery County Poet Laureate, David Escobar-Martin. I fearlessly competed against 21 area poets at the Flash Poetry Festival at the New Hope Arts Center for the coveted Flash Poetry Prize and I have read my poetry at Farley’s Bookshop in New Hope, PA during National Poetry Month. I have also been published in the Schuylkill Valley Journal, River Poets Journal and the Moonstone Anthology of Poets. I live in Bucks County, PA, with my super supportive family and my beloved dog Tuck.</p>
<h3>Why I write:</h3>
<p>For nearly seven years, I have been writing poems and stories. When I write, I feel concealed from the rest of the world. When I write, the words flow...every word has a significant meaning. I write not only about beauty and nature but also about great sadness and cruelty. I love going outside and observing nature and wildlife, but it always touches me to hear about all the horrible and sad events going on in the world, though I seem to live in a bubble where nothing bad happens. Poetry also gives me a calmness where I can be anyone or anything. That is one of the great joys of writing and one aspect that keeps me coming back. </p>

<p><strong>ARIZONA WINE? Yes!</strong></p>
<p>Hello! </p>
<p>I'm excited to introduce myself. I am Jenelle Bonifield, the creator of the fantastic, soon-to-be-released book: <i><strong>""AZ Uncorked, The Arizona Wine Guide.""  </strong></i>My fascination with the exploding wine industry in Arizona is what motivated me to create this compelling book.  My passion for photography allows me to showcase this award-winning, dedicated group of local winemakers. If you like wine, this book’s for you!</p>
<p>As a food and lifestyles photographer in the Phoenix area, I am always surprised by people’s reactions when I mention Arizona wine. Many people are completely unaware that we have wonderful vineyards and winemakers throughout this state.  I am very thrilled to share what I have discovered and photographed in the many unique and diverse areas of Arizona. Just one of the many glowing reviews is as follows:</p>
<p><i>“AZ Uncorked is at once evocative, sumptuous, and fully nuanced with the intimate terroir of Arizona’s wine industry; I wanted to “drink in” every page! The book’s narrative embraces various voices of the local industry, brilliantly keeping the reader engaged. The visual bonus is Bonifield’s superlative photography; there’s a reason she won London’s Errazuriz 2016 Wine Photographer of the Year - Pink Lady Food Photographer’s produce category.”</i></p>
<p><i>    - Candy Lesher, Arizona, Culinary Professional, Current President of the Les Dames        d’Escoffier International Phoenix Chapter, Inductee to Arizona’s Culinary Hall of Fame</i></p>
<p>I am delighted to invite you now, to join me ...</p>

<h3>The Mission:</h3>
<p>To provide a resource for Arizonans and visitors to learn about the many vineyards throughout our rugged high country and the fabulous wines our winemakers create. As a photographer, I often cover events featuring local Arizona farm-to-table produce, only to find California, Italian, French, and Spanish wines paired with these foods. The wines may be delicious, but if we are celebrating Arizona food, why not celebrate delicious Arizona wine?</p>

<p> </p>
<p>From the Introduction of<i> AZ Uncorked:</i></p>
<p><i>“It is a rarity to witness the birth of a new industry. We are fortunate to be cultivating the ground floor of something spectacular. Arizona wines are beautifully complex, extraordinarily balanced, full of depth, and often stylistically unique to the area.” </i></p>
<p><i>     – T. Scott Stephens – co-owner Beckett’s Table &amp; Southern Rail Restaurants</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Journey:</h3>
<p>This project took more than photography; I needed a team, including writers, editors, proofreaders, and a printer.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606694753/ih6idecvenbzganpqjkt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For over three years I have traveled the roads of most of the state of Arizona, capturing every stage of the vineyards and wine-making process through my camera lens. I photographed at all hours of the day and night, during all kinds of weather. It has truly been a labor of love…. However, I need your help and support in funding this and related future projects. These projects aid the ever-growing wine industry, including tourism and viticulture. I want to share what I’ve learned about Arizona’s wine industry, both with Arizonans and visitors, to explore our wine regions and support local.</p>

<p>The year 2020, as you know, has been difficult for most small businesses, and the wine industry has been no exception. I have seen that winemakers and wine industry individuals are among the hardest working, most dedicated, and passionate people on the planet.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606689390/qbhja5vxdkdr0nq0xmcy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Through my book, I have provided information via photographs, interviews, maps, and quick glance side bars on 45 individual wineries and tasting rooms in Arizona. This provides the reader with information to plan their trips without having to leave home, saving both time and money.</p>

<h3>Why I need your financial support:</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise $50,000 in order to cover production and printing costs. Producing a high end, coffee table book is expensive, and I want to continue with more publications and media to support this exploding industry. The higher the volume of each printing, the lower the per unit cost. I could only do a small first edition since I am self-funded. There were no fees to  (or from) featured wineries; no advertising or sponsors. I took no salary for myself.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>When you support AZ Uncorked, you help support future winemakers!</h3>
<p>A portion of any profits of <i>AZ Uncorked</i> will go to the Yavapai College Southwest Wine Center’s Neal Baltz Endowed Memorial Scholarship Fund. The Southwest Wine Center at Yavapai College is a premier wine industry and community resource, offering a comprehensive hands-on education from vineyard-to-bottle with programs in enology, viticulture and business/entrepreneurship through its estate vineyard, teaching winery, fully-operational tasting room, and region-wide wine industry research epicenter.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why I decided to self-publish:</h3>
<p>I wanted an unbiased book, and no restrictions by a publisher. I wanted complete creative control over the design and content. I wanted to support my community by printing locally and keeping all revenue in state. I selected wineries I thought would show diversity in their styles.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606690189/c6k5bvmosne2yzalxqrm.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>To raise the awareness of the Arizona wine industry’s growth and excellence, providing more traffic and sales in local tasting rooms, wineries, and related businesses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a resource for Arizonans to learn about the many vineyards throughout our rugged high country and the fabulous wines our winemakers create. Explore what is in our own backyards.</li>
<li>Arizona is a tourist destination. My book contains information so travelers can plan their visits to wineries and tasting rooms. Arizona's northern wine region has been referred to as the next Napa Valley, yet it has a uniquely Arizonan style.</li>
<li>The ability for me to create a second edition and more publications, including the many emerging wineries, and point wine enthusiasts everywhere in the direction of Arizona.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Another review:</p>
<p><i>“Following in the tradition of great wine guides, AZ Uncorked has everything you need to be inspired to explore the wilds of Arizona wine country. Instructive maps and stunning photography of reposeful and refined vineyard landscapes are supported by heartfelt stories, told by many of those who have helped to shape the Arizona wine world. Historical facts and explorations into regional terroir will also interest those who like a deeper look into viticultural history.”</i></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If I do not reach my goal, I will still use funds raised to publish as many copies of the book as possible.</p>
<p>I have personally assumed the risks associated with this book. All costs were paid personally, and there was no fee (to or from) the featured wineries or tasting rooms. To keep the price of a 544-page coffee table book low enough to sell, it had to be priced accordingly but does not allow for a good deal of reimbursement. If the book is not financially sustainable, I cannot create updates or special editions dealing with other areas of the Arizona wine industry.</p>

<h3>A bit about Arizona wine:</h3>
<p>Three main regions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verde Valley: The rocky limestone soil and sunny climate in the Verde are very similar to the winemaking regions of France and Italy. Elevations ranging from 3,500 to 5,000 feet.</li>
<li>Sonoita-Elgin: Grapes flourish at elevations of 4,500-5,000 feet here, making for some of the highest vineyards in the country. The terrain is high-desert grassland.</li>
<li>Willcox: The warm desert climate, high elevation, and sandy soil provide terroir similar to that in Argentina and Southern France at 4,200 feet and higher.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Some of our outlier vineyards are as high as 5,300 feet.</p>
<p>Our wines have had continuing recognition and wins at the San Francisco Chronicles Wine Competition, Best Wines of North America.</p>
<p>Arizona wines have won competitions at the TEXSOMM International Wine Awards.</p>
<p>Arizona wine produced by several wineries has been served in the White House on separate occasions.</p>
<p>Book contributor Pavle Milic adds these figures from a recent publication:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arizona wine tourism has created $56.2 million in total economic output.</li>
<li>The Arizona wine industry has created 640 full-time jobs.</li>
<li>$3.6 million generated in state and local taxes.</li>
<li>600,000 visitors to vineyards and tasting rooms annually.</li>
<li>Average yield: 2 1⁄2 tons per acre.</li>
<li>One ton of wine grapes can produce around 150 gallons of juice, or about 65 cases, or roughly 782 bottles.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>This is serious, people – go drink a glass of Arizona wine and let’s keep moving forward!</p>

<h3>More on the AZ Uncorked team:</h3>
<p>I pulled together quite a team of contributors for AZ Uncorked. Elaine Chukan Brown of Hawk Wakawaka Wine Reviews wrote the Foreword. Acclaimed restaurateur and sommelier T. Scott Stephens wrote the intriguing Introduction. Erik Berg, Darla Hoffmann, and Elizabeth Krecker are the main writers for the stories, and they did a great job! Published Arizona historian Erik Berg also wrote a great section on Arizona's Wine History.</p>
<p>The guide is divided into sections based on Arizona’s wine regions. Each section has a map and begins with an introduction written by Arizona wine industry professionals and enthusiasts: Cody Chasen Burkett introduces Verde Valley, Pavle Milic introduces Sonoita-Elgin, and Nikki Check introduces Willcox. Michelle Jacob introduces our metro tasting rooms, and Annabel Sclippa introduces the outlier wineries. A bonus of Arizona wine festivals and events is covered by Richard Betts.</p>
<p>My editorial team was amazing! I had Laura Golder Kenney for editing and Libby Floyd Davis for proofreading. Countless hours were spent getting it just right. I appreciate their attention to detail.</p>
<p>My husband Thomas Bonifield was my support throughout the process. We had a design and graphics business together in the past, so his help was invaluable. He helped with the maps and photoshop edits, as well as reviewing content.</p>

<h3>About my background</h3>
<p>A photographer and designer based in metropolitan Phoenix, I love to roam throughout Arizona’s wine regions capturing images of vineyards and winemaking. With a background in graphic design and motion graphics, I always enjoyed photography and became a professional photographer as a second career specializing in farm-to-table images. As a wine lover, my interest in Arizona wine began in 2010 when my friends launched a vineyard and winery in the foothills of the Chiricahua Mountains in southeastern Arizona, LDV Winery.</p>
<p>Working alongside my husband Thomas, our design company, Green Rabbit Design Studio, was the recipient of more than 20 local, national, and international industry awards, including Telly, Worldfest, Creativity International, and ITVA awards. My photographs have been published in <i>AAA/Via Travel Magazine, Sunset Magazine, Wine Enthusiast, Wine Spectator, WhereTraveler, Arizona Food &amp; Wine, Valley Guide, Images Arizona, Paradise Valley Lifestyles, Edible Phoenix, Uptown Magazine and Experience Scottsdale, </i>as well as on the Visit Arizona website. My photographs are on display at several tasting rooms across the state.</p>
<p>In London, I was announced Errazuriz Wine Photographer of the Year in the 2016 Pink Lady Food Photographer of the Year’s produce category with an image of pressing Grenache grapes, “Press 2,” taken at LDV Winery. More than 7000 images from 60 countries were submitted.</p>
<p>My true passion is photographing and documenting the beauty of Arizona’s vineyards and hearing the stories of winery owners and winemakers.</p>

In London, I was announced Errazuriz Wine Photographer of the Year in the 2016 Pink Lady Food Photographer of the Year’s produce category with an image of pressing Grenache grapes, “Press 2,” taken at LDV Winery. More than 7000 images from 60 countries were submitted.
