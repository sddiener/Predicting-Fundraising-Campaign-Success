<p>A cabin consumed by demons, homicidal trees, singing taxidermy, an incorrigible severed hand…</p>
<p>EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL presents incredible and expensive challenges for a nonprofit theater. Director Matt Kollar (<a href=""http://spacebarbariansproductions.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Space Barbarians Productions</a>) and our team of appetent designers and performers are leaning heavily on Sam Raimi’s beloved film trilogy (no, not Spider-Man) to inform decisions every step of the way. It's our responsibility to give the people what they want: the familiar frights and sounds they've known since the VHS era, with enough spewing crimson ichor to make a Deadite blush! We'll need all the evil we can muster for this sanguine showstopper, and since money is the root of all evil, we're asking for your support.</p>
<h3><u>Q&amp;A</u></h3>
<p><strong>""Who are you people?""</strong></p>
<p>Since 2001, <a href=""http://thegaragetheatre.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Garage Theatre</a> and its army of volunteers have transformed a humble space into diverse and immersive entertainment. Our 70<sup>th</sup> show (in our 15th season!) will be no exception. We're all huge fans of Bruce Campbell's classic cabin misadventures, and couldn't be more excited to bring the humor and horror of the original films to a live audience. The aim of this campaign is to supplement our modest production budget, allowing designers breathing room to pursue gruesome greatness and obliterate high expectations. A terrible evil is coming to the city of Long Beach this Halloween season, and only one boomstick-brandishing S-Mart employee will stop it - through song and dance!</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>""How are you using this money?""</strong></p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of where finances will be allocated, should we meet our full goal:</p>
<p>Royalties - $3,900</p>
<p>Set Design/Build - $750</p>
<p>Props (Purchased &amp; Custom-Built) - $1,150</p>
<p>Wardrobe - $300</p>
<p>Special Effects - $200</p>
<p>Stage Blood/Cleaning Supplies - $200</p>
<p>Lighting - $100</p>
<p>Sound - $60</p>
<p>The Garage Theatre is run by an all-volunteer staff so any additional funds received will go towards operations and future productions.</p>

<p>Who Are We? </p>
<p>We are Blood Pact Theatre, and we make plays. </p>
<p>Blood Pact Theatre is a Toronto based indie-theatre company writing, developing, and producing original plays in the GTA since 2016. We have quickly cemented a strong reputation as the punk rock kids “bringing unique, fresh voices to the Canadian theatre scene” (NOW MAGAZINE). </p>
<p>In 2016 our play Kill Your Parents in Viking Alberta premiered in The Storefront Theatre’s 2016/17 season with a box office record breaking sold out run. In March, 2017 we were invited to bring our play After Westling to Factory Theatre’s 2017/18 season earning equal success. This past December our newest play No Clowns Allowed ran for 2 weeks at Assembly Theatre in Parkdale to rave revues and adoration. </p>
<p>We are gearing up to produce our new play Dock Mother God Society, written &amp; directed by Bryce Hodgson. </p>
<p>The Story </p>
<p>Set in Kelowna British Columbia amidst the worst wild fire season in Canadian history, Dock Mother God Society is a play that explores modern western community and its relationship to death, family, generosity, resentment, forgiveness and our connection to the land we live on.</p>
<p> The story is one act  that follows Ed, a recently sober, 32 year old  living with his reclusive widowed god mother, as he tries to win back his wife and young daughter.</p>
<p>Between his aunties stories of magical lake monsters, mermaids, talking trees and never ending war against everyone in her small bay community will he be able to stay sober, survive the summer and prove to his wife he’s in fit condition to come back home and try things again?</p>
<p>The Goal</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise $7000 for our new play, and the funds will be used to the following things:</p>
<p>Appropriate fees for all artists involved </p>
<p>Set/building materials </p>
<p>Publicity materials, so we can get the word out about our play</p>
<p>If you donate, you will be given the opportunity to claim some pretty sweet prizes, including free tickets, theatre themed swag and personal songs. </p>

<p>Cast:<br/>Mark Paci, Ed<br/>Elizabeth Saunders, Bev<br/>Wayne Burns, Jay<br/>John Healy, Rich</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>Toronto's Indie theatre scene is constantly being faced with challenges, in many aspects, but especially proper funding for projects. Although our community is full of vibrant storytellers, artists, and dreamers, it is becoming increasingly difficult for those voices to be shared or heard. </p>
<p>By donating you would be helping a great, passionate group of artists bring a new story to the stage, which we believe will be a fun, thought-provoking piece for many people. </p>

<h2><strong style=""color: orange;"">We did it! What's next?</strong></h2>
<p>A tremendous thank you to all of our supporters! We are so honored and grateful for your contributions -- and inspired by what a community can do when it comes together to reach a goal! Let's keep this momentum going!</p>
<h3><strong style=""color: #04b404;"">Our Reach Goal is $5,000 -- for our Summer Season</strong></h3>
<p>For those of you who would still like to contribute -- fear not! All additional funds raised above and beyond our orginal goal will be saved to continue paying the dancers for our exciting Summer Season.  (Quick preview: this includes a<em> full-length performance on the Boston Common</em> in July as part of the brand new Outside the Box Festival!) </p>
<p>A total of $5,000 will allow us to pay the dancers an honorarium for summer performances.  So every dollar you give will still go directly to the artists involved.  Thank you again for your support! </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">*      *      *</p>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>What’s <em style=""color: orange;"">quick</em> and <em style=""color: silver;"">silver</em> and <em style=""color: orange;"">dances</em> all over?</strong></h3>
<p>Hello! and Welcome to the 2013 Indiegogo campaign for Quicksilver Dance: a modern dance company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is growing like crazy!  In the last year, we’ve had two prestigious residencies, created several new, exciting dances, built up our core number of dancers from five to eight, and continued to reach out to new audiences.  We are on a roll! </p>
<p>And now, Simmons Hall at MIT wants us back!  In what is becoming an annual tradition, Quicksilver Dance will transform the quirky theater in the architectural wonder that is Simmons Hall into another world.  On April 19th and 20th, 2013, we present our newest show:</p>
<h3 style=""color: red;""><strong>“Rites of Passage”</strong></h3>
<p>The dances in “Rites of Passage” will bring you back in time to many different ages of humanity:</p>
<ul>
<li>""Epoch Tales"" is back by popular demand! Eight dancers echo the movement of various life-forms throughout evolutionary history, illuminating how the world may have moved from protozoa to primates.</li>
<li>“Got Art?” takes you on a journey through the history of consumerism, using text and movement inspired by print advertisements of the last hundred years.  This new dance promises to make you laugh out loud and think different(ly) about your daily dose of ads.</li>
<li>New sections of ""Festivals and Visions,” based on 14 grand murals by the Spanish impressionist painter Joaquin Sorolla, explore the rituals, festivals and lifestyles of different regions of pre-WWI Spain. At our fall performance, we presented the first 6 sections, and now we are working on the remaining 8.  When all the sections are complete, “Festivals and Visions” will be Quicksilver's first full evening-length piece, a moving feast of ritual and culture. </li>
</ul>
<p>We hope you are as excited about these new pieces as we are. And guess what?  You can help to make it happen!</p>
<h3 style=""color: #04b404;""><strong>Our Goal is $4,000</strong></h3>
<p>This goal will allow us to pay each of our eight dancers $12 per hour and cover our fundraising costs.  It's not much; and in the future we hope to be able to pay the dancers more – but it's a start.  And in a world where dancers usually work several different jobs - waitressing, tutoring, teaching dance to kids - to support their passion, being paid to dance is what makes high-quality performances possible.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to have limited costs for the show.  Simmons Hall very generously funds the lights and lighting designer, in addition to providing their magical theater.  And because of Simmons’ sponsorship, <em>tickets to the show are FREE!</em></p>
<p>So every dollar you give will go directly to the hard-working artists who will share their passion with you on April 19th and 20th! </p>
<p>We have several fun and personalized perks available for you as a thank you for your donation.  See the sidebar for details!  Many of the dancers, and local friends’ businesses, will be contributing their creative energy and skills for these perks - so look for an option featuring your friend.</p>

A tremendous thank you to all of our supporters! We are so honored and grateful for your contributions -- and inspired by what a community can do when it comes together to reach a goal! Let's keep this momentum going!
Our Reach Goal is $5,000 -- for our Summer Season
For those of you who would still like to contribute -- fear not! All additional funds raised above and beyond our orginal goal will be saved to continue paying the dancers for our exciting Summer Season.  (Quick preview: this includes a full-length performance on the Boston Common in July as part of the brand new Outside the Box Festival!) 
A total of $5,000 will allow us to pay the dancers an honorarium for summer performances.  So every dollar you give will still go directly to the artists involved.  Thank you again for your support!

What’s quick and silver and dances all over?
Hello! and Welcome to the 2013 Indiegogo campaign for Quicksilver Dance: a modern dance company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is growing like crazy!  In the last year, we’ve had two prestigious residencies, created several new, exciting dances, built up our core number of dancers from five to eight, and continued to reach out to new audiences.  We are on a roll! 
And now, Simmons Hall at MIT wants us back!  In what is becoming an annual tradition, Quicksilver Dance will transform the quirky theater in the architectural wonder that is Simmons Hall into another world.  On April 19th and 20th, 2013, we present our newest show:
“Rites of Passage”
The dances in “Rites of Passage” will bring you back in time to many different ages of humanity:

""Epoch Tales"" is back by popular demand! Eight dancers echo the movement of various life-forms throughout evolutionary history, illuminating how the world may have moved from protozoa to primates.
“Got Art?” takes you on a journey through the history of consumerism, using text and movement inspired by print advertisements of the last hundred years.  This new dance promises to make you laugh out loud and think different(ly) about your daily dose of ads.
New sections of ""Festivals and Visions,” based on 14 grand murals by the Spanish impressionist painter Joaquin Sorolla, explore the rituals, festivals and lifestyles of different regions of pre-WWI Spain. At our fall performance, we presented the first 6 sections, and now we are working on the remaining 8.  When all the sections are complete, “Festivals and Visions” will be Quicksilver's first full evening-length piece, a moving feast of ritual and culture. 

We hope you are as excited about these new pieces as we are. And guess what?  You can help to make it happen!
Our Goal is $4,000
This goal will allow us to pay each of our eight dancers $12 per hour and cover our fundraising costs.  It's not much; and in the future we hope to be able to pay the dancers more – but it's a start.  And in a world where dancers usually work several different jobs - waitressing, tutoring, teaching dance to kids - to support their passion, being paid to dance is what makes high-quality performances possible.
We are fortunate to have limited costs for the show.  Simmons Hall very generously funds the lights and lighting designer, in addition to providing their magical theater.  And because of Simmons’ sponsorship, tickets to the show are FREE!
So every dollar you give will go directly to the hard-working artists who will share their passion with you on April 19th and 20th! 
We have several fun and personalized perks available for you as a thank you for your donation.  See the sidebar for details!  Many of the dancers, and local friends’ businesses, will be contributing their creative energy and skills for these perks - so look for an option featuring your friend.

<p>I AM NOT I is a new full-length play set in modern-day America. 15-year-old Jane Jiménez, the daughter of a Jewish mother and Mexican father, is about to have her quinceañera. However, as the celebration of her “transition into womanhood” approaches, Jane isn’t as much excited as she is horrified—because she doesn’t feel like a woman…In fact, she knows she’s not female at all.</p>
<p>Jane isn’t the only one trying to break free of the waltz she’s been taught in order to create a dance of her own. Her mother, Lisa, seems trapped in the past but is unable to find anyone else to live in it with her. Her father, Reynaldo, is about to break under the weight of the secrets he’s been hiding. Her lesbian girlfriend, Dawn, would run away from the trailer park in a heartbeat—if she didn’t have to play parent to her alcoholic mother. All four characters find themselves stepping off-beat, attempting to figure out the proper choreography. <strong>Do we truly have control over <em>who we are</em>? Are we <em>fated</em> to a prescribed story? Or do we have a choice in <em>who we become</em>?</strong> </p>

<p><i>Airmid brings the
work of forgotten or unknown female playwrights to life for today’s
audience - their productions are professional and profound - addressing issues
that are both universal and timeless - thank you Airmid for keeping these works
alive</i>.
--sirschwendy</p>
<p><i>I have attended
readings and full productions. The crisp, professional acting and directing as
well as the plays chosen provide exciting and enjoyable entertainment. The
outdoor setting during the summer is delightful. I particularly enjoy becoming
more familiar with works from women of various eras. Airmid Theatre Company is
great! </i>--
smdsings </p>
<p><i>I think Airmid
offers a great service to the community, both adult and youth. The productions
I have experienced have offered top quality entertainment. I would recommend
others to become fans/members/ or patrons of this company. </i>-- flibertigibet</p>
<p><i>My wife and I
attended our first outdoor Summer Festival Production and were extremely
impressed with the quality of the acting and production value. Professional
actors… brought genuine heart and soul to the performance. The humor they
brought to the performance was a wonderful touch.</i>--cmattern</p>
<p><i>I am a theatre
professor with a specialization in plays by women, so I have been interested in
Airmid for a while. The summer before last, I was in New York for a research
trip. I took a train to Long Island to see both Airmid's children's play and a
fabulous production of Aphra Behn's The Emperor of the Moon. Both productions
were staged outdoors in a beautiful park, and both were very good. The company
operates on donations, bringing free theatre to its community. I think they
also serve an important function by bringing attention to neglected classic
works by female authors. I am impressed with what they were able to do on a
shoestring budget.</i> --

WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT AIRMID!
Airmid is a
non-profit organization who brings the arts into a deeper dimension for the
community. The productions are all first class! – maryg
Airmid brings the
work of forgotten or unknown female playwrights to life for today’s
audience - their productions are professional and profound - addressing issues
that are both universal and timeless - thank you Airmid for keeping these works
alive.
--sirschwendy
I have attended
readings and full productions. The crisp, professional acting and directing as
well as the plays chosen provide exciting and enjoyable entertainment. The
outdoor setting during the summer is delightful. I particularly enjoy becoming
more familiar with works from women of various eras. Airmid Theatre Company is
great! --
smdsings 
I think Airmid
offers a great service to the community, both adult and youth. The productions
I have experienced have offered top quality entertainment. I would recommend
others to become fans/members/ or patrons of this company. -- flibertigibet
My wife and I
attended our first outdoor Summer Festival Production and were extremely
impressed with the quality of the acting and production value. Professional
actors… brought genuine heart and soul to the performance. The humor they
brought to the performance was a wonderful touch.--cmattern
I am a theatre
professor with a specialization in plays by women, so I have been interested in
Airmid for a while. The summer before last, I was in New York for a research
trip. I took a train to Long Island to see both Airmid's children's play and a
fabulous production of Aphra Behn's The Emperor of the Moon. Both productions
were staged outdoors in a beautiful park, and both were very good. The company
operates on donations, bringing free theatre to its community. I think they
also serve an important function by bringing attention to neglected classic
works by female authors. I am impressed with what they were able to do on a
shoestring budget. --

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello! First, we want to thank you for taking the time to visit our project's page. Just by doing so, you have shown yourself to be a supportive member of the theatre community. You are our favorite kind of people! +1,000,000 points for you!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are a group of students at Brown University who have taken on the enormous, daunting, and thoroughly exciting task of founding a repertory company! The Repertory Project (the company's current name) is founded on the values on creating an open, giving, and, most importantly, collaborative environment for creating theatre, while producing work that is both accessible and important to the community at large. We may no know much, but we all believe in the power that theatre has to affect a community, and we want to do just that.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are new to running a company, but we are jumping in head first, producing our first season this February. The theme of this season is 'The Art of Collaboration."" Collaboration is an enormous part of every person's life. From negotiating challenging foreign relations issues to putting on a play, collaboration is about how we connect with each other in our attempt to make a difference in our world. Through the two productions we will present, David Mamet's contemporary classic ""Speed-the-Plow,"" and Michael Hollinger's new play ""Opus,"" we hope to start a conversation in the community about the joys and challenges of collaboration in each of our lives, and what it means to work with others toward a single goal. In a community of young people who are the world's future movers and shakers, we feel like this is an important conversation to have, and one that theatre can effectively take a part in starting.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our project's impact is two-fold. First, there is the impact of important learning experience for the students involved. Students involved in the repertory project (15 and counting) have the unique experience of working in a professional, but fun environment where they teach and learn from each other on a daily basis. For example, all actors work on the stage crew of the production the are not performing in, to give them a different perspective on the theatrical creative process. In such ways, we hope The Repertory Project will help student artists grow into working professionals with the skills to be great leaders and collaborators.</p>
<p>The second leg of our impact is on the community at large. We will be presenting our shows FREE (that's right, absolutely free) for the entire weekend. With six total performances, over 500 people will be able to see theatre without spending a penny. That doesn't just apply to Brown students. ANYONE in the world can reserve a ticket and come to the show. In such a way, we hope to reach out beyond Brown's borders and bring together students with members of the community at-large to share the work we will have created.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have trimmed our needs down to the bare minimum. We don't want to waste your money! We want to put it to good use. However, all we have now working for us is a free space and a lot of enthusiasm. Below are our bare minimum needs:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Royalties: $650- That's right. Just to be legally allowed to put on our six performances, this is the price we must pay.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Sets: $350- That's right. We are going to attempt to build two ENTIRELY different sets for just this much. It will take a lot of work and savvy spending, but we think we can do it.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Costumes: $200- We need over 20 costumes to make our season run. We have our amazing designer attempting to make this happen for only $10 per costume. She has her work cut out for her.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Props: $200- Screenplays and cheesecake and violin cases, telephones and wine glasses and music stand bases, smashable instruments tuned up with strings, these are a few of our necessary things.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Publicity: $100- Word-of-mouth is golden, but how can we create word-of-mouth without fliers and posters to spread to the community?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Remember: This is the BARE MINIMUM we need to function. Please help us meet and exceed our goal. Any funds beyond our goal of $1500 will go to bettering our productions and outreach to help bring diverse audiences to our shows. </p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3><span> </span></h3>
<h3><span>The GOOD Works Theatre Festival is an international, <span class=""text_exposed_show"">four-day festival celebrating new and emerging playwrights, presenting original works July 25-28, 2013.</span></span></h3>
<h3>
<br/>The Good Works Theatre Festival is more than a theatre festival; it is representative of a grandiose, international community of artists who have collaborated as playwrights, actors, directors, stage managers and designers. Selected works will be presented to an audience in a festival setting where the heart of the matter is the celebration of the craft and artistry of playwrights. GOOD Acting Studio has facilitated a strong line-up of national, local, and regional talent to be your storytellers for a four-night engagement, turning a bright spotlight on Atlanta, Georgia.</h3>
<h2><strong>Why we are different</strong></h2>
<h3>We are an international festival! One goal of the festival is to facilitate an exchange of works from country to country.</h3>
<h3>The GWTF spirit is a desire to see a circulation of works and ideas that will become a movement that will celebrate and revitalize playwrights everywhere.</h3>
<h3>We want to use this festival as a vehicle to bring the world of the arts together. To take one piece of work in one geographical location, and then see it in a new place and culture, seeing how similar it can be and different at the same time.</h3>
<h3>The top two plays will be sent to  theatre companies around the world in an exchange of works that will become international productions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2>We need your help!</h2>
<h3>Our Indiegogo fundraising goal is $1200.</h3>
<h3>Publicity, lighting and sound equipment, set and props , printing costs, oh my!</h3>

</div></div>","Who we are and What we do
 
The GOOD Works Theatre Festival is an international, four-day festival celebrating new and emerging playwrights, presenting original works July 25-28, 2013.

The Good Works Theatre Festival is more than a theatre festival; it is representative of a grandiose, international community of artists who have collaborated as playwrights, actors, directors, stage managers and designers. Selected works will be presented to an audience in a festival setting where the heart of the matter is the celebration of the craft and artistry of playwrights. GOOD Acting Studio has facilitated a strong line-up of national, local, and regional talent to be your storytellers for a four-night engagement, turning a bright spotlight on Atlanta, Georgia.
Why we are different
We are an international festival! One goal of the festival is to facilitate an exchange of works from country to country.
The GWTF spirit is a desire to see a circulation of works and ideas that will become a movement that will celebrate and revitalize playwrights everywhere.
We want to use this festival as a vehicle to bring the world of the arts together. To take one piece of work in one geographical location, and then see it in a new place and culture, seeing how similar it can be and different at the same time.
The top two plays will be sent to  theatre companies around the world in an exchange of works that will become international productions.
 
We need your help!
Our Indiegogo fundraising goal is $1200.
Publicity, lighting and sound equipment, set and props , printing costs, oh my!
Ticket revenue currently only offsets roughly one-third of theatre production costs, which makes your involvement crucial to our success.
Your donations will go towards funding these essential areas of our festival
Imagine the thrill of knowing YOUR gift is another step closer to putting a dream on center stage.

<p>Roaring Lion Theatre is raising money to put on a dream project, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Goblin Market, </span>at the 2011 Vancouver Fringe Festival.  We are a group of 3 women who have been talking about putting this show on for about 5 years.  We have pitched it to a few theatre companies in town, but none, due to funding challenges were willing to take a risk on the project.  <br/></p>
<p>This year we decided to take a leap and not only produce the show ourselves, but to do it in a beautiful outdoor venue as part of the Vancouver Fringe Festival.  This is an exciting but risky venture financially( and possibly environmentally due to the Vancouver weather)! <br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We need to raise $2500 in total to get this show up on its feet.  Part of the reason this amount is so low is that we are not paying our artists.  Roaring Lion Theatre is a collective, which means that the artists agree to do the show for free and then split the box office equally after ticket sales.  <br/><br/>Your money would pay for:<br/>- costumes<br/>- props<br/>- lighting<br/>- instrument rental<br/>- Theatrical Rights for the show (this means the people who wrote the show are paid for this wonderful piece of art they have written).  The show costs $100 per night to produce.  <br/><br/>Our potential ticket sales per night are $500 if we sell out every night.  <br/><br/>A successful show in Vancouver plans for 30% attendance per night.  That means 15 people per night.  <br/>That is only $150 per night.  <br/><br/>Our costs per night:<br/> - $50 for the venue<br/> - $10 for lighting<br/> - $10 for props<br/> - $15 for costumes<br/> - $10 for instrument rental<br/> - $100 for Theatrical rights<br/><br/>Total costs per show: $195.  So we are running a $45 per night deficit before we even start to think about paying artists.  <br/><br/>I am sure you see our challenge.  We plan to hold our own fundraiser, a summer party, but every little bit helps! <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">You can donate on this page with your credit card, or if you want to use another method, please contact us at roaringliontheatre@yahoo.com. </span><br/><br/>

Roaring Lion Theatre is raising money to put on a dream project, Goblin Market, at the 2011 Vancouver Fringe Festival.  We are a group of 3 women who have been talking about putting this show on for about 5 years.  We have pitched it to a few theatre companies in town, but none, due to funding challenges were willing to take a risk on the project.  
This year we decided to take a leap and not only produce the show ourselves, but to do it in a beautiful outdoor venue as part of the Vancouver Fringe Festival.  This is an exciting but risky venture financially( and possibly environmentally due to the Vancouver weather)! 

About Goblin Market

""We must not look at goblin men,

We must not buy their fruits:

Who knows upon what soil they fed

Their hungry thirsty roots?""




Set in a magical outdoor venue this sensual voyage through the 
labyrinths of the Laura and Lizzie's imaginations will weave an enchanting spell
that will linger long in your memory. Goblin Market is a beautiful, intimate
musical about the sexually charged fantasies of  two proper Victorian
sisters.  
Laura and LIzzie are both now grown women and mothers, and they return to their childhood nursery to
relive the haunting memories of their youth. Magically, they are transported
back to their girlhood, as their nursery becomes a woodland glen peopled by
bizarre goblins who entice them with luscious fruits and promises of unimagined
ecstasies.   

Who we are:

Barbara Tomasic directs a stellar cast of Vancouver actors; Lauren Bowler, currently starring in Anything Goes at Theatre Under the Stars plays Lizzie and Tracey Power, the writer and star of the Fringe hit Living Shadows: A Story of
Mary Pickford, plays the younger Laura. 
They are joined by the amazing musical talent of Steve Charles (Brief Encounter,
Back To You, The Fugitives) who will bring the intricate music to life.



Impact
Goblin Market will be have its BC Premiere at the Vancouver Fringe Festival with Roaring Lion Theatre.  The impact of this campaign is that it will allow a piece of theatre to happen that would not be produced in Vancouver under different circumstances.  In this time of a lack of artistic funding, theatre companies are not taking risks on new unknown pieces.   If Goblin Market is successful there is an excellent chance that it will be picked up by a larger theatre company and produced again.  

This will provide work for at least 5 artists directly and potential for more in the future! 


What We Need & What You GetWe need to raise $2500 in total to get this show up on its feet.  Part of the reason this amount is so low is that we are not paying our artists.  Roaring Lion Theatre is a collective, which means that the artists agree to do the show for free and then split the box office equally after ticket sales.  Your money would pay for:- costumes- props- lighting- instrument rental- Theatrical Rights for the show (this means the people who wrote the show are paid for this wonderful piece of art they have written).  The show costs $100 per night to produce.  Our potential ticket sales per night are $500 if we sell out every night.  A successful show in Vancouver plans for 30% attendance per night.  That means 15 people per night.  That is only $150 per night.  Our costs per night: - $50 for the venue - $10 for lighting - $10 for props - $15 for costumes - $10 for instrument rental - $100 for Theatrical rightsTotal costs per show: $195.  So we are running a $45 per night deficit before we even start to think about paying artists.  I am sure you see our challenge.  We plan to hold our own fundraiser, a summer party, but every little bit helps!

<p><strong>My name is Joe Beck. I wrote <em>A Homecoming</em> after meeting an elderly couple who had spent their lives working hard and raising children of their own. Instead of being blessed with good health and a peaceful retirement, they were assaulted with a life changing diagnosis-Alzheimer's. James and Lee, both in their mid to late seventies, refused to be defeated however, and James took care of his wife until the end. This is a tender, long goodbye; a love story so genuine it can be called part Virginia Wolf, Romeo and Juliet, The Brady Bunch and The Adams Family.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Alzheimer's is a national issue and this story, I'm proud to say, puts a human face on it.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>The funds raised will go to paying for rehearsal space, administrative fees, the actors and sets, props, costumes, insurance and transporatation.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Writing, directing and performaing a play about Alzheimer's and how it affects families and loved ones and friends we hope will have a strong inpact on audiences in a way that is respectful, tender and educational.

<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Why this show is important to Vancouver Pride 2013?</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Eleanor Rigby: The Untold Story</em> deals with current issues using the backdrop of the 1940-60’s worldview. A coming of age and self-discovery story, <em>Eleanor Rigby: The Untold Story</em> explores how coming to terms with oneself is a unique journey that crosses the boundaries of sexuality, faith, and morality. In the show, we see how mixed feelings and messages result in an emotional rollercoaster for our heroine and how ultimately the only opinion that matters is your own.</p>
<p>This story takes place in a period where no one talked about sexuality or how to resolve certain feelings and conflicts. Furthermore, it demonstrates that historically not many people were brave enough to openly be in a homosexual relationship because of social stigmas.</p>
<p>Breaking barriers between communities through music, dance, and storytelling, Eleanor Rigby: The Untold Story teaches that being authentic to one’s self, no matter what, is the most important thing in life. </p>
<p>Rae of Life Productions along with Vancouver Pride Society is committed to serving the Vancouver community a brand new experience during pride – a musical!  What could be more appropriate? </p>
<p>We are booked for 5 shows over the course of 4 days at the Orpheum Annex Theatre - a beautiful 150 seat theatre located in the heart of Vancouver and sister theatre to the world renowned Orpheum. There’s not a bad seat in the house! This is a fantastic venue which boasts brilliant acoustics, state of the art lighting and the most helpful and wonderful staff in town!</p>
<p>It is the hope of the Rigby Team that by taking the show to this next level of development that we will educate and encourage people to embrace their uniqueness, no matter what it is, and that the show will become a vehicle to spread this message to a larger worldwide audience.</p>

Before Ellen, there was Eleanor Rigby.
Eleanor Rigby: The Untold Story is the story of a young woman who in the early 1940’s begins a struggle between her faith and her own demons as she comes to terms with her sexuality.
A feast for the senses, Eleanor Rigby: The Untold Story combines elements of live music, dance, and storytelling, as it weaves together musical styles from “Annie” to Ani (DiFranco).

Why this show is important to Vancouver Pride 2013?
Eleanor Rigby: The Untold Story deals with current issues using the backdrop of the 1940-60’s worldview. A coming of age and self-discovery story, Eleanor Rigby: The Untold Story explores how coming to terms with oneself is a unique journey that crosses the boundaries of sexuality, faith, and morality. In the show, we see how mixed feelings and messages result in an emotional rollercoaster for our heroine and how ultimately the only opinion that matters is your own.
This story takes place in a period where no one talked about sexuality or how to resolve certain feelings and conflicts. Furthermore, it demonstrates that historically not many people were brave enough to openly be in a homosexual relationship because of social stigmas.
Breaking barriers between communities through music, dance, and storytelling, Eleanor Rigby: The Untold Story teaches that being authentic to one’s self, no matter what, is the most important thing in life. 
Rae of Life Productions along with Vancouver Pride Society is committed to serving the Vancouver community a brand new experience during pride – a musical!  What could be more appropriate?

In Brief
After two years of training and theatre creation together at the Jacques Lecoq Theatre School in Paris, Jo Even Bjørke, Jon Levin, Oda Kirkebø Nyfløtt and Vincent Vernerie have come together to create THE KRUMPLE THEATRE COMPANY.  We are at this very moment rehearsing and developing our first show “Go to Sleep, Goddamnit!” in Norway, which we will premiere at the Camden Fringe Festival in London this August.  
 
While we're lucky enough to have free theatre space in Norway to rehearse, we still need to pay for theatre rental in London, transportation, festival fees, marketing, props, costumes, etc to make this show a reality.  We've been putting everything we've got into this show, but we need your help to get us there. 
 
With your help we will be able to finish creating this show, and bring it to London for our premiere.  Beyond this summer, having this show under our belt will help us apply for grants and residencies next year.  It's a crucial moment for us and we hope you'll consider supporting us as we take this leap.  

What We Need & What You Get
We’re asking for 2000 euros to help us pay for the costs of the show. This money will be going towards rental of the Camden People’s Theatre in London, the Camden Fringe Festival fees, transportation, the creation of our masks, sets, props, costumes and rehearsal space in London.  This amount won’t pay for all the show’s expenses, but with ticket sales we’re hoping to break even.  
We’ve got perks for every level, giving away personalized postcard creations, photo prints, a knitting/sewing surprise, mini masks and a gourmet dinner.If we don’t reach our goal, we will still get the funds that we’ve raised (though we’ll get less of them, because Indiegogo will take a higher percentage).
The Impact
This show is a huge step for our company.  It’s our first full length production and we’re doing it all ourselves; writing, directing, designing, producing and marketing. This first step will allow us to apply for funding from Norway and France, and will pave the path to presenting our show in Edinburgh next summer.  
Although we’re a new theatre company, our members have a lot of experience creating and producing theatre. Jon, Oda and Vincent have all had experience establishing and leading theatre companies. Jon has worked on the producing and directing side of Sinking Ship Productions in New York for four years.  We’re confident that our communal experiences have given us the skills we need to create and produce this project.  For more information on each of us, please look at the “About us” section of our website.  
Other Ways You Can Help
If you aren’t able to donate financially, please consider liking our company page on Facebook and sharing our campaign with your friends using the Indiegogo like buttons.
Come to our show!  There’s no show without an audience.  We’ll be playing in London from August 17-19th.  Click here for tickets.  We hope to see you there!

Please note:  The donation will appear as Oda Kirkebø Nyfløtt and not The Krumple, as we are in the process of formalising our company.  
 

 
En bref, 
 
Après deux ans de formation à l'école Jacques Lecoq, Jo Even Bjørke, Jon Levin, Oda K. Nyflott et Vincent Vernerie ont créé ensemble le Krumple Theatre Company. 
Nous sommes actuellement en pleine répétition de notre premier spectacle ""Go to Sleep, Goddamnit"" en Norvège, dont la première aura lieu en août, à Londres, pendant le Camden Fringe Festival. 
 
Nous avons la chance d'avoir un espace gratuit en Norvège pour répéter. Cependant, il nous reste à payer la location du théâtre à Londres, les frais de transport, les frais du festival, la communication, les accessoires, les costumes, etc, pour que ce spectacle devienne réalité. Nous y avons mis tout notre cœur, mais nous avons besoin de votre aide pour nous permettre d'aller jusqu'au bout. 
Avec votre soutien, nous pourrons finir la création du spectacle et l'emmener jusqu'à Londres pour notre première.
 
 Après cet été, le fait d'avoir joué ce spectacle à Londres va nous permettre de demander plus facilement des subventions et des résidences pour l'année prochaine. C'est un moment crucial pour nous, ce serait un grand pas en avant si pouviez nous supporter. 
 
Ce qu'il nous faut, ce que vous obtenez
 
Ici, les details:
 
- Nous demandons 2000 euros pour nous aider à couvrir les frais du spectacle. Cela comprend la location du Camden People's Theatre à Londres, les frais du Camden Fringe Festival, les frais de transport, la création de nos masques, notre scénographie, accessoires, costumes et espace de répétition a Londres. Ce montant ne couvrira pas toutes les dépenses du spectacle mais avec la vente des tickets, nous espérons bien rentrer dans nos frais. 
 
- Nous avons des ""petits cadeaux"" pour chaque niveau, des cartes postales personnalisées que nous créons nous-mêmes, des photos et affiches de notre spectacle, des surprises ""cousues à la main"", des mini-masques et un dîner gourmet. 
 
- Si nous ne parvenons pas à atteindre ces 2000 euros, nous pourrons quand même recevoir la somme atteinte au bout des 30 jours. Néanmoins, celle-ci sera diminuée puisqu'en pareil cas Indiegogo prélèvera un pourcentage plus élevé.
 
L'impact 
 
Ce spectacle est un grand pas pour la compagnie. C'est notre première production et nous faisons tout nous-mêmes; l'écriture, la mise en scène, la régie, la production et la communication. Ce premier pas va nous permettre de demander des subventions en France et en Norvège, nous pourrons ainsi tracer notre sentier vers Edimbourg pour y présenter notre spectacle l'été prochain. 
 
Même si nous sommes une jeune compagnie, chacun d'entre nous a de l'expérience dans la création et la production d'un spectacle. Jon, Oda et Vincent ont créé et dirigé des compagnies de théâtre.

<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p></div>","Onebody Works was founded in 2009 with the vision of creating an ensemble of individuals committed to nourishing the bonds among people and their environment. 
 
In pursuit of our vision the Onebody Works Summer Intensive was created. During the summer of 2009 the Onebody Works ensemble incorporated the experiences of collective living, daily farm work, and an organic, local diet into a co-creative process to produce  ""Late Harvest"". The piece traveled on a national performance tour to venues in Louisiana, New Mexico, Alabama and California and the Burning Man Festival in Black Rock, Nevada. 
 
In August of 2010 the second Summer Intensive focused specifically on deepening our commitment to local artistic and agricultural community development. Over a four-week period six actors generated “The Seed”, touring locally to several venues in Asheville, Warren-Wilson College and Black Mountain and closing at University of North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem, NC to a crowd of hundreds of students, faculty and community members.
 
During the intensive, we minimize our environmental impact by living on the land in a tent camp without electricity, cooking over fire or with propane, fetching water from the mountain spring and bathing in the pond. We work 20 hours a week toward the farm’s operations, in exchange for our campsite, rehearsal space and food produced by the land we work. We spend an additional 25 hours each week in rehearsal and artistic exploration that culminates in the creation of a new, challenging performance piece.
 
This summer we are continuing to grow and evolve by participating in the Capital Fringe Festival in Washington, D.C. Our new piece ""I See You""  explores our relationship to technology and is currently in co-creation on Hickory Nut Gap Farm with an ensemble of eight artists including:
 
Kayla Carter, Carrie Davis, Drew Madland, Ben Mandelbaum, Sam Mandelbaum, Shannon Mackenzie, Nathaniel Mendez and Nathan Vargo, with help from Victoria Campbell.
 
In our effort to live and create sustainably, the bulk of our needs while on the farm-- a campsite, rehearsal space, meat from Hickory Nut Gap and vegetables from Flying Cloud-- are provided in exchange for the ensemble's work. While we are able to provide these things through our work we still need your help to launch us out into the community; your contribution will support bringing this vision of sustainability in art and life to the masses! 

Here is how our budget breaks down and what your tax-deductible contribution will be used toward:
 
$700 Transportation to performances in Asheville, Washington, D.C. and Winston-Salem (1000 miles with two cars)
 
$775 Capital Fringe Participation Fee (entrance fee and performance insurance)
 
$500 Marketing (flyers, posters and newspaper ads)
 
$640  Food Staples and Supplies (rice, beans, bread, peanut butter, oats, honey, bug spray, sun screen, candles, bio-degradable soap)
 
$500 Administrative Cost (non-profit status fee, communications, outreach)
 
$250 Materials (lights, wood, rope, screws, propane, tarps)You can meet the artists and follow our progress this summer through periodic video posts on this website, so stay tuned for more to come......
 
Also, you can help get the word out by forwarding this page to your friends, family and colleagues!

I am taking the initiative by producing and directing and acting in a rehearsal project of William Shakespeare's greatest tragedy <em>King Lear</em>.<br/><br/>I chose to produce <em>Lear</em> as the themes of control, faith, and how a crisis of the two (in others and in ourselves) are extremely topical. We as young student artists have very little control in regards to rising prices of such things as food and rent. There is little representation or connection between us and the political machine. We have faith that learning, teaching, producing art is somehow redemptive and our production needs your help to regain faith in the power of the people to come together to make something of their own. This project is what amounts to the first production of a burgeoning theatre company I've called the Jung Actors' Company ('Jung' is pronounced 'Young' by the way ;)...). I hope that our pooled resources of talent and determination to 'make' are enough to help us produce good work and for you to help contribute to a company of young idealists looking to strengthen their faith in the power of you...the power of us.<br/><br/>The production is using NYU &amp; Adler actors. Rehearsals take place several times a week at the Stella Adler Studio. As of right now, we are opening up a rehearsal as a benefit. This will show the public where we're at creatively and how your funds have been applied. We hope to continue to raise interest and additional funding in order to stage the entire play on a raised-stage later in the summer. The upcoming workshop benefit will be held at Theaterlab (137 W 14th Street) Wednesday 27 June @ 7pm.</p>

<p>The $1,920 is broken down into performance and rehearsal fees which have been shopped for and kept to a minimum. To book an off-off Broadway venue on off-peak evenings costs $345 per night. Our company is rehearsing for free at Adler and will more than likely be using living rooms and parks. That said, two rehearsals at the 13th Street theatre are mandatory: one tech and one dress rehearsal. These rehearsals are billed at $45/hour and will be requiring the black box from 10am-5pm the Thursday and Friday prior to the run. Therefore...</p>

<p><em><strong>We are the BASiC Theatre Project and we need your help.</strong></em> In April 2012 a group of guys got together and unknowingly created a truly powerful presence in the Downtown NYC Theatre world with a production of Mois<span>é</span>s Kaufman's <em>Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde.</em> With that, Zi Alikhan (BASiC's Artistic Director) and Anthony Jackson (BASiC's Executive Director) saw a hell of a lot of dreams come true. <strong>With your support we are going to continue realizing dreams with a fully produced, four-show season in 2013.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>What we're doing is important.</strong></em> We are here to create theatre that is a catalyst for social change. We aren't just making theatre. We're making theatre about contemporary issues, hot-button topics, stuff happening in the world right now, and inciting our audiences to actual change. We're collaborating with other artists to incorporate visual and mixed media to enhance the audience's experience and promote other artists striving to achieve the same thing. We're not the next broadway show. We are the next campaign for important social change.</p>
<p>When we reach our campaign goal we will have a huge portion of the funds we need to make awesome, mind-blowing, powerful, important theatre. We will be able to rent better performance venues, have real rehearsal space, print legitimate programs and advertising materials, build beautiful sets, find amazing props, and <strong>PAY OUR ACTORS</strong>.</p>
<p><em><strong>The quality is already there. We just need you.</strong></em></p>

<p><b>We want your attention. And a little financial help wouldn’t

Istropolitana, international festival of theatre schools. </b></p>
<p>Istropolitana Project is an international festival of theatre
schools, held at the Theatre Faculty of Academy of Performing Arts in
Bratislava every two years. The oldest art school in Slovakia, where all of
the  Slovak important actors, directors,
theatrologists or movie makers have studied. This project gives a unique
opportunity to young artists, theatre scientists and cultural managers to confront
their work with an audience and professional public, which may result in future
cooperations and making a worldwide network of cultural activities. This
festival is one of its kind in Central Europe and has served as a place for
meeting young promising actors and future theatre or movie stars since 1977 -
some of whom are still waiting to be discovered. It is also a place where you
can meet various  authorities for the
industry from all over the world. During the 19 years of existence, our
festival has presented students, educators and important figures from various
countries, such as Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, France, Indonesia,
Switzerland, Bulgaria, Great Britain, Macedonia, Moldova, Spain, Croatia,
Russia, Latvia, Romania, Iran, Italy, Columbia, India etc.</p>
<p>Festival offers natural environment for developing
international art projects. By its character and ambitions, it is an important
event within the European culture with emphasis on theatre and art education.
Our project has had remarkable outreach, during its existence we have hosted
artists from more than 90 countries from around the world.</p>
<p>Within our festival, we as students are organising theatre
displays, discussions, seminars, performances, new ways of education,
intellectual reflection, presentation, confrontation, site specific space for
the audience, off-program, afterparties (with your name and attendance ;)<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">), workshop Jacques Copeau - New commedia dell’arte, Matthew

<p>About organisers:<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Theatre Faculty of the Academy of the performing Arts is the oldest educational
institution in Slovakia, which fosters all our stars in field of theatre,
music, dancing, movies and tv production (for example Gabriela Marcinkova who
has appeared in a movie with Jude Law...). Did you know that Angelina
Jolies grandparents originated from Slovakia? We have got talent flowing in our
blood ;)</span></p>
<p>Our school was established in 1949 in Bratislava. Theatre
Faculty is independently and freely developing educational, artistic and
scientific activities and creates suitable conditions for artistic production.
We cooperate with art schools, cultural and social institutions at home and
abroad. Our alumni are notable artists working in Slovakia and throughout the
world. Our faculty offers study programs in: acting, musical acting, theatre
directing and dramaturgy, theatre management, puppetry, puppetry directing,
dramaturgy, scenography and techology, theory and criticism of theatre, scenic
and costume production.</p>
<p>And what does the faculty offer to us? Opportunity for
imagination and independent creativity. </p>
<p>That is the reason we came up with this video for supporting
our project.</p>
<p>In terms of education, Theatre Faculty of Academy of
Performing Arts produces 14-15  productions
of drama or alternative character every year. A large amount of our
productions were awarded at festivals at home and abroad and have received our
most honorable theatre award - DOSKY..</p>
<p>In terms of international meeting, the festival gives an opportunity
for artists to discuss their activities and discover new tendencies and aims of
performance art and allows presentation of these productions.</p>
<p>It is a great place for presenting new creative methods and
it can serve as the beginning of new creative relationships and further
cooperation.</p>
<p>Festival Instropolitana 2014, by its wide artistic and
non-artistic offer, brings an opportunity of cultural realisation for both
professional and amateur public.</p>
<p>We have been working on it since September 2013! Let's make
our work count!</p>
<br/><p>We need 4321,- euro for whole project. Please support us, we have special perks just for you! :)</p><p></p><p></p><h3><br/></h3></div>","Hello! Thanks for visiting the ""Istropolitana

Within our festival, we as students are organising theatre
displays, discussions, seminars, performances, new ways of education,
intellectual reflection, presentation, confrontation, site specific space for
the audience, off-program, afterparties (with your name and attendance ;)), workshop Jacques Copeau - New commedia dell’arte, Matthew
Rogers workshop of modern-day dancing and physical theatre, creative workshops
and various art workshops.• VŠMU Stage,• Student jury and its interaction with generationally
congenial theatre enthusiasts• Reflektor – a festival journal• Professional culture - workshop of management skills for
cultural managers• On-off meeting )
About organisers:Theatre Faculty of the Academy of the performing Arts is the oldest educational
institution in Slovakia, which fosters all our stars in field of theatre,
music, dancing, movies and tv production (for example Gabriela Marcinkova who
has appeared in a movie with Jude Law...). Did you know that Angelina
Jolies grandparents originated from Slovakia? We have got talent flowing in our
blood ;)
Our school was established in 1949 in Bratislava. Theatre
Faculty is independently and freely developing educational, artistic and
scientific activities and creates suitable conditions for artistic production.
We cooperate with art schools, cultural and social institutions at home and
abroad. Our alumni are notable artists working in Slovakia and throughout the
world. Our faculty offers study programs in: acting, musical acting, theatre
directing and dramaturgy, theatre management, puppetry, puppetry directing,
dramaturgy, scenography and techology, theory and criticism of theatre, scenic
and costume production.
And what does the faculty offer to us? Opportunity for
imagination and independent creativity. 
That is the reason we came up with this video for supporting
our project.
In terms of education, Theatre Faculty of Academy of
Performing Arts produces 14-15  productions
of drama or alternative character every year. A large amount of our
productions were awarded at festivals at home and abroad and have received our
most honorable theatre award - DOSKY..
In terms of international meeting, the festival gives an opportunity
for artists to discuss their activities and discover new tendencies and aims of
performance art and allows presentation of these productions.
It is a great place for presenting new creative methods and
it can serve as the beginning of new creative relationships and further
cooperation.
Festival Instropolitana 2014, by its wide artistic and
non-artistic offer, brings an opportunity of cultural realisation for both
professional and amateur public.
We have been working on it since September 2013! Let's make
our work count!
We need 4321,- euro for whole project. Please support us, we have special perks just for you! :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In the running time of 300 Snapchats (50 mins), #ArtistLife is a coming-of-age comedy that asks what it means to be an artist when everyone in your social stratosphere is online and #envy is trending. I mean, if you make art but don't post it, does it actually exist?</p>

<p>#ArtistLife came from a place of constructive dissatisfaction. A few months ago, as actors we felt we were in a place where our careers were not our own. We were losing control and going to audition after audition, waiting on others to give us a magical ‘Yes’. We have big dreams and nothing that we could sink our teeth into was popping up.</p>
<p>We kept hearing the best way to keep working, growing and learning is to make your own work. So we signed up for #sydneyfringe in 2017.</p>
<p>We've been active in indie theatre for several years now, but this is the first time for both of us taking on producing, writing, performing and directing all in the one go.</p>
<p>We've set ourselves a pretty big task and up till now been financing the project ourselves. We're so close to being stage ready, and with the production just a month away we'd like to offer you some cool perks as you help take #ArtistLife to the next level.</p>
<p>Your donations will be used to subsidise the following production costs:<br/>- Venue Hire<br/>- Performance Rights<br/>- Design Elements including Set and Costumes</p>

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I'm a Dancer, Teacher and Choreographer of Indian dances. Born in Poland , I grew up learning Polish national dances for 12 years. Meanwhile, I also trained in Ice-skating and Ballet for 6 years.<br/>My love for Indian culture, especially Indian Music and Dance started at a very young age and it came along with our family interest and practice of Sahaja Yoga meditation. Since then, my only dream was to learn Indian dance. Unfortunately at that time, it wasn't possible for me to pursue my dream in Poland and I had to wait until 2007, when I started learning Kathak basics in Poland (under a Polish dancer Magdalena Niernsee, graduated from Kathak Kendra, New Delhi) and then finally visited India for the first time in 2009.<br/>It happened naturally that my love and passion for dance became my profession. I graduated with a  Bachelor's degree in Choreography and Dance Techniques from the Music Academy in Lodz, Poland (2013) and continued Masters in Choreography and Dance Theory at University of Music, Warsaw, Poland (2015). Teaching and performing in Poland is definitely what I love to do, but deep in my heart there was unending desire to learn more and experience this beautiful tradition of Guru-Shishya parampara (Master - Disciple tradition) in India.<br/> So since 2009, I visit India every year for 2-3 months for my Kathak training. By God's grace and my immensely supportive friends, I had the opportunity to learn from the best Gurus - Pt. Arjun Mishra, Pt. Birju Maharaj, Mamta Maharaj and Saswati Sen and for the last 5 years I've been a part of Abhinava Dance Company, learning under Smt. Nirupama and Shri T.D. Rajendra in Bangalore, India. This year I decided to stay for 5 months for a more intensive training but especially to prepare for my solo performance LEELA.</p>
<p>About LEELA </p>
<p>Traditionally, in Indian Classical dance, when the Guru deems a disciple ready after years of  training, he or she does a special dance performance called ""Rangapravesh"", which is a graduation, a celebration on the completion of formal training, a humble offering of gratitude towards the Dance Guru (teacher), family, friends, other dancers, art connoisseurs and special guests of honour.  It is a Dance Diploma, when after performing with a good review a dancer joins the professional circle of classical artists, and that the dancer can now move forward and pass on the art form to other aspiring learners of the art. <br/>So LEELA is my Rangapravesh, 2 hours solo stage performance with live music. It consists of 5 choreographies of traditional kathak repertoire.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I need your support? </strong></p>
<p>The cost of this event in a city like Bangalore is more than what I can afford right now. I don't have a steady income, like most freelance artists, and I am simply running on my savings , especially for the last 5 months that I am in India, I am totally devoted to my training and gearing up for this performance, which frankly is one of the most important performances in my life! And you can help me realize this dream!</p>

<p>After another
amazing season, with amazing work onstage, with amazing audiences, who were in

Inc. again shines the looking glass onto 2 of literature’s most famous
characters, who on the surface appear to be complete opposites. One, a certain
boy who will never grow up. The other; one of Shakespeare’s kings who has grown
quite old. Yet they both seem to suffer a clear case of “Peter Pan Syndrome”;
flying about from place to place, searching for a mother, and oblivious to the
destruction they leave in their wake.<span>

<p>A reimagining of the classic children’s story
adapted from the original J.M. Barrie play, The Terrible Tragedy of Peter Pan
casts adults in the roles traditionally played by children. And explores
through this new lens, what it really means to never grow up. Director
Christina Sheehan’s sparse yet gritty design, institutionalizes each character
in a way that lets us look into their psychology as we watch each “play”
through their individual psychoses. A world made of “faith, trust, and fairy
dust” that makes us ask ourselves are we in Neverland, or is Neverland inside
all of us? </p>

Our project 



http://newyorklivearts.org/event/let-my-peopleIn Astrid Bas's latest creation, LET MY PEOPLE GO, second to a series initiated  by ""Life or theater""  by Charlotte Salomon, the worlds of Sarah Kane—English poet and playwright, depressive, in and
out of institutions, who took her own life at age 27—and Charlotte Solomon—German Jew
from a prestigious family haunted by multiple suicides, a visionary and
prolific painter, who died at age 26 in a concentration camp—The worlds of these two women collide, as have the voices of those such as Angela Davis, Nelson Mandela, and other courageous souls who have struggled and fought for the meaning of true freedom and liberty over bondage of all kinds.

Astrid Bas has worked predominantly within French Government subsidiary institutions and has well proven her worth as an artist. She is exploring the works of Charlotte Salomon and Sarah Kane, both oppressed, one by Nazism and one by her alienation, mental illness. 


In LET MY PEOPLE GO,  movement,
text, and video (Ghiora Aharoni) blend together to express the poetry of life, love, creation, liberty. 
 Who we are 
Astrid Bas, actress, dancer, director has had a long career as an actress working with directors such as Georges Lavaudant, Anatoli Vassiliev, Jean Marie Patte, Frederic Fishbach, Raimund Hogues, Edward Niermans, Benoît Jacquot, Hélène Vincent, Christophe Perton, Frédéric Berthes, Nicolas and Bruno...As a director she has staged Tchekov's three Sisters (Odeon theater, Paris) , Duras's The lover and La musica 2, Life or theater, Materiau Platonov, Phaedra in India. As a dancer, she has worked with Peter Goss, Robert Moses, Raimund Hogues and Alonzo King, enriching and expanding her vision and ways of telling stories through the body.
 Frederic Moulin, Actor As a theater actor he has among others worked with E. Cerruti, Geiger, Nicolas Maury, Robert Cantarella...In film he was an actor with Pippo Delbonno, Robert Cantarella, Russ Holt, Soukourov, Dick Turner... He trained as an actor at International Center of Performing Arts in Paris. He also holds a master in translation studies. He is fluent in English and Italian.

Darrell Davis, Consultant, was a   Ballet dancer at the Dance Theater of Harlem, he then worked with Jean Claude Gallota for 14 years as a dancer,  assistant choreographer and trainer for the company. He has been teaching at the CCN in Grenoble, at the Australian ballet, at the CNSMD in Paris and at the DV8 company. In his teaching he uses a technique develloped by Balanchine and works on fast paced movement in space. 


What we have accomplished


After many efforts and much support from talented, generous, and committed collaborators, Astrid Bas and company have secured two performances at NY LiveArts on June 28th and 29th. 
Where we wish to go

Creating new work is always a challenge. Creating new work in another country is an even greater challenge. But creating a new work for New York is the greatest challenge of all! LET MY PEOPLE GO has been fully supported by the Gibney Dance Center, ODC in San Francisco, Alonzo King's Lines Ballet, Centre National de la Danse and generous individuals, moving the piece from workshop to a full fledged show. 
LET MY PEOPLE GO has been invited to perform at Joe Goode Annex in San Francisco. The funds from your generous support will be used to ensure further production costs and allow the show, through outreach and publicity, to be seen in New York, San Francisco and Paris.


                         JOIN THE TEAM                        

The Astrid Bas Company needs your support to realize these goals. 

Any contribution helps.
Come and see the show at New York Live Arts June 28th and 29th at 7:30pm.
More information about post-show talk backs, the NYLA show, and the show at the Annex will be forthcoming closer to the dates of the debut. We hope to see you there!

Notre projet
LET MY PEOPLE GO est une création originale de danse théâtre d'Astrid Bas, seconde partie d'une série initiée lors d'une Villa Medicis hors les murs par ""La vie ou le théâtre ?"" de Charlotte Salomon.
Astrid Bas y poursuit sa réflexion sur l'univers​ de Charlotte Salomon, ainsi que  sur celui​ de Sarah Kane, deux femmes artistes toutes deux opprimées, l’une par le nazisme, l’autre par son aliénation au monde et  la maladie mentale, à la recherche de leurs propres voix.
Sarah Kane, poétesse et auteur dramatique britannique, sujette à la dépression, a vécu des séjours en hôpital psychiatrique et met fin à sa vie à 27 ans. Charlotte Salomon, juive allemande, née dans une famille prestigieuse hantée par de nombreux suicides, peintre prolifique et visionnaire, est morte à 26 ans dans un camp de concentration. 
Apr​è​s sa Villa Medicis hors les murs et  ""La vie ou le théâtre"" à ODC theater qui ont permis d’élaborer le travail, LET MY PEOPLE GO a été présenté en résidence à Gibney Arts Center et au Centre National de la Danse à Pantin en 2015. LET MY PEOPLE GO sera créé à  NY Livearts les 28 et 29 Juin 2016. 
Le mouvement, le texte et la video (Ghiora Aharoni) se rejoignent pour exprimer la poésie de la vie, l’amour, la création, la liberté…

the city is having one of its own: the 2003 blackout. Reclusive novelist Hugo Thomas
hasn’t written anything in years. After accepting an advance for a new book, he’s
assigned a beguiling yet challenging young editor to assist him at his
downtown apartment. When Hugo's apartment is plunged into darkness, secrets are
revealed and the two men launch into a psychosexual game of cat and mouse. 
Setting: New York, August 2003

""I'm delighted that Michael Raver's compelling play, Fire on Babylon, has been selected for this year's Fresh Fruit New Play Festival,"" says director Paul Mason Barnes. ""Michael's is a unique voice in the American Theatre.  His wit, intelligence, sense of tension and surprise combined with his knack for writing dialogue that sounds like what real people actually say make his plays a pleasure to direct. I'm excited that this new work will be shared with a wider audience; very happy to get to work with Michael as both playwright and actor; and honored to help Fire on Babylon take this next step forward.""  







""Fire on Babylon is passionate, it is ABSOLUTELY fearless, it is
beautifully, and professionally, written and it announces a
genuine playwriting talent. It is a story of the very many complexities involved in any
passionate love between two people. And the meanings of it
unfold, constantly. In other words, it unfolds with a seriously
developed dramatic sense.""
                                              -Austin Pendleton (actor/director/playwright)

""One of the richest and most riveting plays I've seen in a long time, grounded in the power dynamics of age difference, but universal in a very soulful way.""
                                                -Stephen Greco (author, Now and Yesterday)

<h3>Wit's End Theatre has a new play-in-development!</h3>
<p><em>Science Inaction</em> [working title] is set to receive a workshop and performances this June in Halifax, NS but we need YOUR help to do it!</p>
<h3><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></h3>
<p>A TV-obsessed young grad student studying amphibian neurobiology can’t help but be charmed by the gawky doctoral candidate visiting her lab. But when he doesn’t turn out to be all she had hoped, she takes matters into her own hands, making him an object of scientific experimentation. Set in the height of civilization that was 1997, the play reimagines the so-called Science Wars of the 1980s and 90s as a War of the Sexes.</p>
<p><em>Science Inaction</em> will receive a two week workshop with performances in late June, 2012 at the Bus Stop Theatre in Halifax. </p>
<h3><strong>ABOUT WIT'S END</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Long:</strong></p>
<p>Halifax-based Wit’s End Theatre creates, produces, and presents new and classic comedic plays. We promote the role of comedy in theatre and enrich our community by facilitating educational outreach programs and providing opportunities for local artists. Our goal is to provoke thought and discussion through and about humour, wit, and laughter.</p>
<p>Wit’s End is not just out for shallow laughs. The organization recognizes the inherent value in laughter for laughter’s sake and privileges the role of comedy in artistic and intellectual exploration. Often something is funny because it’s out of the ordinary: comedy points us to the bizarre, the unexpected, and the extra-ordinary.</p>

</div></div>","Wit's End Theatre has a new play-in-development!
Science Inaction [working title] is set to receive a workshop and performances this June in Halifax, NS but we need YOUR help to do it!
THE PROJECT
A TV-obsessed young grad student studying amphibian neurobiology can’t help but be charmed by the gawky doctoral candidate visiting her lab. But when he doesn’t turn out to be all she had hoped, she takes matters into her own hands, making him an object of scientific experimentation. Set in the height of civilization that was 1997, the play reimagines the so-called Science Wars of the 1980s and 90s as a War of the Sexes.
Science Inaction will receive a two week workshop with performances in late June, 2012 at the Bus Stop Theatre in Halifax. 
ABOUT WIT'S END
The Long:
Halifax-based Wit’s End Theatre creates, produces, and presents new and classic comedic plays. We promote the role of comedy in theatre and enrich our community by facilitating educational outreach programs and providing opportunities for local artists. Our goal is to provoke thought and discussion through and about humour, wit, and laughter.
Wit’s End is not just out for shallow laughs. The organization recognizes the inherent value in laughter for laughter’s sake and privileges the role of comedy in artistic and intellectual exploration. Often something is funny because it’s out of the ordinary: comedy points us to the bizarre, the unexpected, and the extra-ordinary.
The Short:
We make funny theatre.

<p><strong>Facing Page Productions </strong>is producing our next event! It is <strong>Company’s Marathon 2013: a reading of all of Shakespeare’s plays… in a row!</strong></p>
<p>That’s right everyone. We are going to read the entire canon, 24/7 starting <strong>Tuesday, April 16</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> at 8pm</strong> (kickoff party at 7pm) through <strong>Saturday, April 20</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> at 10am</strong>! This event, created by Gordy Hoffman in 1998, has been done in Chicago and Los Angeles. Company’s Marathon 2013 will mark its New York debut!</p>
<p>For our inaugural year in NYC, we asked André Braugher to set the reading order for us. He’s put together an exciting line-up: keeping the Histories in historical order and alternating the Comedies and Tragedies throughout.</p>
<p>There are two goals to the <strong>Marathon</strong>: create a community of folks to honor the Bard by reading his words aloud and to finish the <strong>Marathon</strong> by reading the entire canon without stopping. Anyone can sign-up to read in any play they want. Just come with a positive attitude and an interest in Shakespeare! It’s free to sign up and since we are reading for 86 hours in a row, there is bound to be a time that works for you!</p>
<p><strong>We need YOUR HELP:</strong></p>
<p>We need <strong>funders </strong>to help us raise money to make this event a reality. Right now, Winnie and Ryan are using their own coffers because they believe in the importance of bringing the words of Shakespeare to as many people as possible. And, to be honest, it’s exciting to be building a community of people in New York who love Shakespeare and are willing to help us reach our goals.</p>
<p>We’ve created an Indiegogo campaign. With Space Rental, staffing, postcards, swag (yes, swag!), etc. It will cost us about $6000 to produce this event. Please join us in making this a reality and donate!!! No amount is too small!</p>
<p>                                 Please Help (or we’ll starve…literally)!</p>

<p>
For her tenure as the Reigning Queen of Burlesque, Trixie Little is creating a new play that combines the art of burlesque with classic theater in a fuckloric folktale for the ages. Opening March 17th in Baltimore, April 1 in NYC.
</p>
<p style=""font-size: 28px; line-height: 1.3; font-family: georgia;""> 
The Queen of Everything tells the story of milk maid, Trixie Litttlewurst, who is slave to the demands of a giant Cuckoo Clock and taunted by her shadows, The Nightmares. Until one day, a chance encounter with an old beggar woman launches Trixie on the ultimate heroine’s journey to retrieve the crown that will buy her freedom. 
</p>
<h4>WHAT IT IS</h4>
<p>Conceived by a genius group of women, <b>The Queen of Everything</b> is a striking, visual immersion into a charmingly twisted fairy tale landscape of the imagination. Performed with raw physicality to a live original score by the psycho-Mambo band, Gato Loco, the show is a true fusion of physical, visual and traditional storytelling. Starring Trixie Little, Edie Nightcrawler, Georgia Sanford, and directed by Justine Williams.
</p>
<h4>WHAT WE NEED!</h4>
<p>We need $18,000 to make this show. Our work/build space and theater rentals in New York and Baltimore are 50% of our budget alone. The rest of our budget is going to fund an original score with an incredible band and set and costume builds by a creative team assembled from the New York performance community. Your funds help support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theater for 9 Performances in NYC and 3 Performances in Baltimore</li>
<li>3 Months of Space Rentals</li>
<li>Original Music by Mambo Band, Gato Loco</li>
<li>Materials for Sets, Costumes and Props</li>
<li>Lighting, Puppeteering and Stage Hands</li>
</ul>
<h4>WE NEED IT NOW! (LIKE REALLY)</h4>
<p><b>The Queen of Everything</b> opens this spring. The theaters are booked, the website is up, our team is hard at work every single day trying to give this show the attention it needs. We need a timely infusion of cash to keep all of the energy and momentum flowing without interruption. We are directly asking you to support the project’s completion in any way you can.  If you believe in innovative new theater, in your queen (Trixie Little), and in art itself, WE NEED YOUR HELP!

My biggest fear is not that I'm going to fail. My biggest fear is that I will succeed.   ""I'm strapped for cash, mate!"" I completely understand if you're saving your hard earned money for a ticket at the door ;)
That said, if you cannot donate, if you wouldn't mind sharing this on Facebook with that handy-dandy link down there, that'd be great. ANDMention me to your friends! Gather them all and bring them out to see my show!

<h3>YoungCastle Theatre Collective</h3>
<p>YoungCastle Theatre Collective began in 2016 with the idea that there should be no bounds to theatrical creativity. Founding artists Rebecca Anne Muhleman and Hannah Polaski wanted to share that belief with the community and thought who better to go on a crazy creative journey than young people! Since 2016 we and the newly formed board (comprised of youth ages 16-20) have created and produced numerous shows, workshops and concerts to benefit local charities. Now we would like to ask for your help to produce full length work, starting with their summer show, Grave Myth-Takes.  </p>
<p>This campaign will help us fund the venue, costuming, prop, sound design, make-up and set costs for our August show, Grave Myth-Take, but will also allow us to plan and implement a 2017-2018 season. You see, we want to be a resource for young people who have the passion and desire for story telling, performance and art, but we also want to contribute and be an outlet for all disciplines of visual and performance art in our community. We want to create connections with people. We want to inspire people to chase their dreams. And we want to offer a safe and welcoming home for young artists to express themselves and to see their art resonate within society. </p>
<p>But all of that, unfortunately takes funding. Nearly $1000 of our goal will go directly to fund Grave Myth-Takes in August. That breaks down to:</p>
<p>$750 to rent Art Works (<a href=""http://www.artworksrichmond.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.artworksrichmond.com</a>) for 3 nights</p>
<p>$100 for costumes and make-up</p>
<p>$100 for set dressing and display of the original visual art that is being CUSTOM made by local youth artists for the show</p>
<p>And the remainder will go to sundry things like printing and promotional needs.</p>
<p>The second $1000 will enable us to create a costume storage, pay dedicated talent, and will help us secure rehearsal and performance venues for our 2018 mainstage season. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We are SO grateful for any donations, big or small!</p>
<p>$5 donations will receive a cool, limited edition YoungCastle button!</p>
<p>$10 donations will receive a signed picture of the cast of Grave Myth-Takes, and a button!</p>
<p>$25 donations will receive a voucher for a complimentary ticket for any night of Grave Myth-Takes, and a button!</p>
<p>$50 donations will receive a behind the scenes look at Grave Myth-Takes, including a private look at fight call, and the make-up and costuming that brings the show to life! And you'll get a button!</p>
<p>$100 donations or more will receive a piece of art that was CUSTOM made for the show! And of course a button!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation to YoungCastle's campaign is so appreciated! It will impact the artistic and creative dreams of dozens of teens in the central Virginia area by giving a safe place for them to express, collaborate, create and connect. It will show them that their opinions, and their messages are important and deserve a voice. It will also help us to reach out to the community and to show them that the meaning of art is truth, connection and love.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We can not thank you enough for considering our campaign, but we know that not everyone is in a place to give financially! No donation is too small, and donations of time and connection are SUPER valuable! If you are able, please consider SHARING this campaign with others who might be interested! Facebook, Twitter, Insta, Snapchat---We NEED help getting the word out about our mission! And if you want to drop by our Facebook page, @YCTheatreCollective, or visit our Instagram page, @yctheatre, and say hi, get info, connect with us or just check out or pics---We WELCOME you!</p>
<p>Thank you so much again!</p>

It will impact the artistic and creative dreams of dozens of teens in the central Virginia area by giving a safe place for them to express, collaborate, create and connect. It will show them that their opinions, and their messages are important and deserve a voice. It will also help us to reach out to the community and to show them that the meaning of art is truth, connection and love.

Other Ways You Can Help
We can not thank you enough for considering our campaign, but we know that not everyone is in a place to give financially! No donation is too small, and donations of time and connection are SUPER valuable! If you are able, please consider SHARING this campaign with others who might be interested! Facebook, Twitter, Insta, Snapchat---We NEED help getting the word out about our mission! And if you want to drop by our Facebook page, @YCTheatreCollective, or visit our Instagram page, @yctheatre, and say hi, get info, connect with us or just check out or pics---We WELCOME you!
Thank you so much again!

<h3>Who We Are:</h3>
<p>Marie-Christine Giordano Dance (MCGD) is a Brooklyn based dance company. In celebration of its 15th anniversary, the company is developing a new evening-length work to premiere at BAM Fisher on June 2nd and 3rd, 2017. MCGD is a non for profit (501)(c)(3) and your donation is tax-deductible to the full extent provided by law.</p>
<p>Giordano has developed her own technique over the years, based on principles of modern dance and ballet that she values. It strives to develop a powerful core in dancers by strengthening the muscles of the trunk, granting them the freedom to explore the full potential of their physical and artistic expression.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">""Ms. Giordano is clearly a choreographer committed to constructing a personal dance vocabulary.”  -Gia Kourlas, <i>The New York Times.</i></p>
<p>Building on our continual outreach to the community we serve, prior to our BAM premiere we will present excerpts of our work in progress followed by a Q&amp;A session to multiple Brooklyn public schools. Additionally, we will offer them discounted and free tickets to the BAM Fisher event. </p>
<h3>The Work:</h3>
<p>Our society and the Earth are at a crossroad. We face questions that may be difficult to answer and challenges that seem overwhelming. For all that, there remains the transformative power of the breath, the mystery and exhilaration of energy in motion and being alive now.</p>
</div><div><h3>Where Your Support Goes: </h3></div><div>
<p>It goes without saying that the impact of your support is invaluable.</p>
<p>Your donation will be used to contribute to:</p>
<p><strong>Dancer Pay</strong>: This project will provide an opportunity for seven dancers to perform professionally at BAM. Some are recent graduates of B.A. or B.F.A. programs at universities and will thus make their stage debut. With your support, the project will provide a unique opportunity for these young dancers to grow artistically. The training of the cast for this project is thorough and precise, and requires extreme dedication and hours for the dancers to master its sound principles and technique. Since the  artists are devoting so much of their time, it is vital we provide them with compensation.   </p>
<p><strong>Free &amp; Discounted Tickets for Students</strong>: Our work seeks to engage our community. With your help, we can provide public school students tickets.  It is our hope that the work will inspire these young attendees and demonstrate to them how discipline, perseverance, resilience and love leads to an artistically relevant and satisfying end, and your support lends a helping hand. </p>
<p><strong>Technical Fees</strong>: Your support will help us literally make it to the theatre! Rehearsal space fees, costumes, lighting designer, transportation of ourselves and materials, you will help ensure we get to the stage. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am a graduate of the Writing Seminars (Creative Writing) and Theatre Arts &amp; Studies programs at Johns Hopkins University, where I also was the president of the student-written theater group Witness Theater. As a theater-person out in the world in search of a stage, I am constantly being reminded that there is nothing like the theater to bring people together and share stories of our lives.</li>
<li>Sharing stories with an audience is very important in my household: my wife, Michelle -- a poetry MFA candidate -- and I are both trained actors, improvisers and writers. We read Robert Frost to each other at home and argue over aesthetics and value and everything else about art after leaving any venue (in a museum, a cinema, a theater), sometimes agreeing and often not...</li>
<li>I've tried my hand at other disciplines (fiction, humor writing, filmmaking), but theater <i>is my thing.<i> </i></i>It's what I'm good at and what I have the most passion about. Human moments and stories played out right in front of an in-person audience -- we're the ones that say it to their faces! It's exhilarating to start my own company, doubling-down on the theater and how important it is in my life and how vital an art form it is to a community.</li>
<li>Nothing is more important to me than to present credible, honest work that is engaging, exciting, funny (!) and true--in short, work that is a thoughtful and truthful reflection of life.</li>
<li>I've been fortunate enough to be a part of the community at the Steel City Improv Theater for the past several years where I have been given the opportunity to perform and produce shows on a regular basis. I also served as the Lead Producer for the Fall 2017 Season. I have been overwhelmed with the enthusiasm for this project from my peers and friends there and have been able to bring many of them into the fold for the BSE inaugural production this Spring: Pigeon (3.5).</li>
<li>The original ensemble members for the project, each an equal member in the production of Pigeon (3.5), are: Jon David, Elizabeth Hildreth, Jane Hyland, Jeremy Lesifko-Bremer, Michelle Lesifko-Bremer, Emily Naples, and Andrew Yankes.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>For this production we have two goals: to put on an awesome, excellent, exciting, funny (!), moving (?) play <i>and</i>  to bring in as large an audience with whom we can to share that experience.</li>
<li>We are looking to raise funds for our modest prop, set, and costume needs and our advertising costs, to get the word out about our show and the BSE mission.</li>
<li>Whatever level our funding we achieve will help us in these areas. The more that we're able to raise, the greater the impact of the show on the Pittsburgh theater community and BSE's ability to mount more ambitious, original works in the future.</li>
<li>We have a number of giving levels that come with some great perks including specials thanks, hanging out at the cast party and -- of course -- merch!</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>BSE's goal is to connect with individual people on a local level, both those that are interested in creating theater and those that want to experience it.</li>
<li>By contributing to BSE, you're investing in the belief that the theatre is a safe space in which all people can take refuge; that theater is a home and a sanctuary, where we can all drop our daily defenses and indulge in contemplation and introspection.</li>
<li>To paraphrase our laureate, of sorts, Robert Frost whose poem ‘Birches,’ gives us our name, it is our mission to take our audience away from earth awhile when things are too much "" like a pathless wood"" and allow them to come back to it and begin again, with a fresh perspective.</li>

What We Need & What You Get

For this production we have two goals: to put on an awesome, excellent, exciting, funny (!), moving (?) play and  to bring in as large an audience with whom we can to share that experience.
We are looking to raise funds for our modest prop, set, and costume needs and our advertising costs, to get the word out about our show and the BSE mission.
Whatever level our funding we achieve will help us in these areas. The more that we're able to raise, the greater the impact of the show on the Pittsburgh theater community and BSE's ability to mount more ambitious, original works in the future.
We have a number of giving levels that come with some great perks including specials thanks, hanging out at the cast party and -- of course -- merch!


The Impact

BSE's goal is to connect with individual people on a local level, both those that are interested in creating theater and those that want to experience it.
By contributing to BSE, you're investing in the belief that the theatre is a safe space in which all people can take refuge; that theater is a home and a sanctuary, where we can all drop our daily defenses and indulge in contemplation and introspection.
To paraphrase our laureate, of sorts, Robert Frost whose poem ‘Birches,’ gives us our name, it is our mission to take our audience away from earth awhile when things are too much "" like a pathless wood"" and allow them to come back to it and begin again, with a fresh perspective.


Risks & Challenges

We are starting from the ground up. We have no budget, no reputation, and no followers (on social media or otherwise).
This is also our first show: we don't know what we can expect.
I feel equipped to handle all the unexpected challenges due to my boot-strapping shows into existence for the better part of the past decade.  Some examples:
At Hopkins, I directed multiple outdoor Shakespeare productions on the library steps, with every actor playing multiple roles, no budget, and Mother Nature's whims to contend with (aka: that time it rained...).
With Witness Theater, I've led multiple entirely-student written, produced, and acted productions.  I have experience in lighting design, set construction, directing, acting, and playwriting that easily transfer to my role here at BSE.

I've also put together a great team of collaborators with a variety of experiences to help me along the way.  By investing in BSE, you're not just investing in me--you're investing in all of them, too.  You can count on the entire ensemble to help make this company and our inaugural production a success.

<p>I'm also a wife, mother of two, part-time waitress, and full-time graduate student. I decided almost a few years ago that in order  to pursue writing as a career, I needed to learn more of the craft and legitimize my credentials so that calling myself a writer didn't just sound &amp; feel like a pipe dream. I applied to, and got accepted at University of Southern California's School of Dramatic Arts. I'm 2/3 of the way to my MFA in Dramatic Writing and I'm a Teaching Assistance there as well.</p>
<p>One of the many amazing opportunities for graduate playwrights is the <b>Intiman Theatre's Emerging Artist Program</b>. It's ""designed to prepare a diverse group of theatre makers for a successful future in the industry."" At the encouragement of my professors, I applied. I submitted one of my plays — <i><b>Black Super Hero Magic Mama</b></i> — and received an overwhelmingly positive response to the play and an invitation to train, work and ""emerge"" at this Summer's Intiman EAP! This is a huge opportunity to study in masterclasses, collaborate, and network with other emerging artists and theatre professionals. It is an opportunity to further develop my play (which has recently won three other development opportunities), and to introduce my work to the Seattle theatre industry.  </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why I Need Your Help</h3>Well, all that sounds perfect. Except, Intiman is in Seattle, WA, and the program is 7 weeks long. I live in Northridge, CA, where I wait tables part time. I need to get to Seattle, fund living there for that month and a half, and maybe eat something. And wash my clothes.<br/><p></p>
<h3>About Intiman</h3>From the <a href=""http://www.intiman.org/emergingartistprogram/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Intiman site</a>, here's info on this incredible 7-week program:<p></p>
<p>This summer 20-30 Emerging Artists (including actors, directors, writers, stage managers, and producers) will participate in workshops and masterclasses led by distinguished theatre professionals, receive guidance and mentorship from experts in their field, collaborate with peer Emerging Artists, and gain exposure and connection to the inter-workings of Intiman Theatre. This year’s selected Emerging Artists will also create a showcase that features and celebrates great American playwrights who also happen to be black women.</p>

<p>Emerging Artist Program goals include:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Recruiting a diverse pool of candidates based on talent and potential.</strong> In the spirit of Intiman’s mission to “produce theatre that is relevant to our time and as diverse as the community in which we live,” and to be a more community-engaged professional theatre, the Emerging Artist Program will train a diverse group of talented theatre artists to lead the next generation.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Training to prepare artists to work professionally.</strong> The Emerging Artist Program will cultivate and train a diverse pool of artists who might not otherwise have access to professional theatre opportunities.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Placement within the industry.</strong> The final goal of the program is to get participants hired or engaged in future Intiman mainstage productions, or other professional opportunities in Seattle and nationally. This is an ongoing goal with Emerging Artists who successfully graduate IEAP. We want to help you succeed!</p>

<p><em>Collective
Unconscious Performance is a sponsored project of </em><a href=""http://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/fiscal/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em>Fractured Atlas</em></a><em><em>, a non-profit arts service
organization. Contributions for the purposes of Collective Unconscious
Performance must be made payable to Fractured Atlas and are tax-deductible to
the extent permitted by law.<br/></em></em><b><br/>WHO WE
ARE<br/></b>Founded by David Hanzal and Katharine Sherman in 2014, Collective Unconscious
Performance creates original, multidisciplinary performance works in
Minneapolis/St. Paul.<br/>
<br/>
David and Katharine met as graduate students at the University of Iowa’s
Theatre Program, through their collaboration in the nationally-recognized Iowa
Playwrights’ Workshop. Originally bonding over a mutual love of fairy tales,
ancient mythology, autobiographical performance art, glitter, and blood, they
began to create work together during their graduate studies. <br/>
<br/>
David and Katharine are now ready to present their first full-length performance
work in Minneapolis, which they have been developing together since spring
2013. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>WHAT IS
YOUR SHOW ABOUT?<br/></b>Dark fairy tales and puppets collide at love-sick Victor von Valentine’s Cabaret
for the Broken-hearted. Directed
and conceived by David Hanzal. Written in collaboration with Katharine Sherman,
and loosely inspired by the life and stories of Hans Christian Andersen. <br/>
<br/>
This new performance work is a dream about a dreamer. Celebrated storyteller
Victor von Valentine secretly morphs his tortured life story and failed love affairs
into beautiful and tragic fictions, which he performs exquisitely with his handmade
puppets. Accompanied by his whiskey-slinging, side kick Emma the duck, Victor
crash lands into the final performance of his world tour. There’s something off
about Victor’s performance tonight, and as he weaves his bittersweet tales with
his intricate puppets, his stories change shape and the moods shift. <br/>
<br/>
Ice maidens, mermaids, sequins, blood, glitter, red dancing shoes, and a
bottomless sea of whiskey: a meditation on isolation, creativity,
transformation, and why sometimes it seems we only write with broken hearts.<br/><br/><strong>
</strong>With your support, this new work will run for a week of performances at the
Bryant-Lake Bowl Theater in Minneapolis, MN, in summer 2015. <br/><strong>
<br/>
<br/>
WHY DO WE
NEED YOUR HELP?<br/></strong>Our work is made possible by our generous supporters. Creating
visually-driven theatre from scratch in any urban arts community is expensive,
and as emerging theatre artists in a new city we rely on charitable
contributions for a portion of our funding. </p>
<b>
</b><p>Every penny we receive from you goes directly into bringing our new
production to life. We have a lot of work to do before then, so any help you
can offer will go a long way.<br/>
<br/>
This is a very ambitious project that is unlike anything that you’ve ever seen
before, and if we don’t raise enough money for the production, you never will!<br/>
<br/>

Unconscious Performance is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service
organization. Contributions for the purposes of Collective Unconscious
Performance must be made payable to Fractured Atlas and are tax-deductible to
the extent permitted by law.WHO WE
AREFounded by David Hanzal and Katharine Sherman in 2014, Collective Unconscious
Performance creates original, multidisciplinary performance works in
Minneapolis/St. Paul.

David and Katharine met as graduate students at the University of Iowa’s
Theatre Program, through their collaboration in the nationally-recognized Iowa
Playwrights’ Workshop. Originally bonding over a mutual love of fairy tales,
ancient mythology, autobiographical performance art, glitter, and blood, they
began to create work together during their graduate studies. 

David and Katharine are now ready to present their first full-length performance
work in Minneapolis, which they have been developing together since spring
2013. 


WHAT IS
YOUR SHOW ABOUT?Dark fairy tales and puppets collide at love-sick Victor von Valentine’s Cabaret
for the Broken-hearted. Directed
and conceived by David Hanzal. Written in collaboration with Katharine Sherman,
and loosely inspired by the life and stories of Hans Christian Andersen. 

This new performance work is a dream about a dreamer. Celebrated storyteller
Victor von Valentine secretly morphs his tortured life story and failed love affairs
into beautiful and tragic fictions, which he performs exquisitely with his handmade
puppets. Accompanied by his whiskey-slinging, side kick Emma the duck, Victor
crash lands into the final performance of his world tour. There’s something off
about Victor’s performance tonight, and as he weaves his bittersweet tales with
his intricate puppets, his stories change shape and the moods shift. 

Ice maidens, mermaids, sequins, blood, glitter, red dancing shoes, and a
bottomless sea of whiskey: a meditation on isolation, creativity,
transformation, and why sometimes it seems we only write with broken hearts.
With your support, this new work will run for a week of performances at the
Bryant-Lake Bowl Theater in Minneapolis, MN, in summer 2015. 


WHY DO WE
NEED YOUR HELP?Our work is made possible by our generous supporters. Creating
visually-driven theatre from scratch in any urban arts community is expensive,
and as emerging theatre artists in a new city we rely on charitable
contributions for a portion of our funding. 

Every penny we receive from you goes directly into bringing our new
production to life. We have a lot of work to do before then, so any help you
can offer will go a long way.

This is a very ambitious project that is unlike anything that you’ve ever seen
before, and if we don’t raise enough money for the production, you never will!


WHAT ARE
WE DOING WITH THE MONEY?While we have self-funded the creation of many of the puppets and
masks in this visually-driven production, we still need your support to cover
additional production expenses.  

We are asking for $3,000 to help cover the cost of renting rehearsal space,
costumes, props, scenery, promoting the show, and paying the performers and
designers!
Any donations
above and beyond our goal will be used toward our next production, to be
presented in 2016.

<h3>The Impact</h3>I believe the timing is perfect for this show. We’re in the age of the ""helicopter parent"" and ""trigger warnings.” It’s startling to see just how much times have changed since the 1970's when some of us (who refuse to admit to our age) were set loose after school to fend for ourselves while Mom and Dad went to a key party. It's no surprise to me that we children of the 70’s became anxious helicopter parents. For all its craziness, though, I believe the lesson of that decade (and my play) is that no matter how “unique"" the family, no matter how great our parents' foibles or how unusual their philosophy, if we are loved, we're gonna be okay. No matter what happens in those early years, a whole lot of unforeseen crap is gonna go down in each of our lives. In the end, the secret to happiness (in my humble opinion) is resiliency, forgiveness and love. And I certainly learned that in spades from my colorful family.</div><div>
<p>I have found that audience members of every age really resonate with this message in the play - and everyone seems to enjoy a lot of laughs along the way.</p>
<p>Your contribution will enable a unique piece of theater to come to life and will give amazing artists the opportunity to practice their craft and bring joy to the masses. Helmed by our Drama Desk Award-winning director Josh Hecht, our cast includes multiple Broadway actors and downtown darlings. A professional actress with off-Broadway credits and a full resume of on-camera commercials myself, I’m also a newly minted playwright who specializes in plays with female protagonists. My work has already been produced or developed by New Georges, the SoHo Playhouse, Naked Angels, Ensemble Studio Theatre, the Axial Theatre, Core Artists Ensemble and more. My first ten-minute play was made into the short film THE DUCK INCIDENT, directed by Emmy Award-winner Barbara Rick.</p>
<p>Thisbe Productions has a track record for successfully bringing women-centered stories to the stage. We had great success in the 2009 Midtown International Theatre Festival when we produced Jennifer Fell Hays' SEAL SONGS, directed by Kathy Gail MacGowan. That play garnered rave reviews, a sold out run and a Best Actress Award nomination for moi, Katie Atcheson. Thisbe Productions also brought IN TRANSIT - written by Matt Hoverman, directed by Padraic Lillis and starring yours truly - to FringeNYC 2006. The production sold out its run and won the Best Playwriting Award.<br/><br/></p>

<p>Though we are, first and foremost, a teaching studio, we're now launching our first production: Polly Pen and Peggy Harmon's <i>Goblin Market</i>, adapted from the narrative poem by Christina Rossetti. </p>
<p>This intimate chamber musical is written for just two characters—sisters Laura and Lizzie—portrayed in our production by students Anna Plummer and Meagan Raker, directed by Melinda Beasi, with choreography by Connie Flachs and musical direction by Lemuel Gurtowsky.  </p>
<p>The script is entirely in verse, and the music has a classical sensibility, appropriate to the poem's victorian setting. It is a challenging, beautiful, and occasionally dark work, filled with rich, vivid language and fantastic imagery that must be evoked solely by its two young actresses and the small musical ensemble.  We're thrilled to be able to work with such fine young performers, and are anxious to match their commitment with equal care and dedication. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p></p>

</div></div>","Who We Are Act Too Studio is a small, family-run performing arts studio serving the Pioneer Valley.  We offer private and classroom study, workshops, and master classes for students of all ages who wish to pursue excellence in the the areas of voice and acting.  The studio's founders, Bob and Jan Klump, have been training performing artists for over fifty years, and many of their students have gone on to prestigious university programs and professional performing careers.  Joining them is their daughter, Melinda Beasi, a seasoned professional now teaching and coaching full-time, as well as a host of professional guest artists. 
Though we are, first and foremost, a teaching studio, we're now launching our first production: Polly Pen and Peggy Harmon's Goblin Market, adapted from the narrative poem by Christina Rossetti. 
This intimate chamber musical is written for just two characters—sisters Laura and Lizzie—portrayed in our production by students Anna Plummer and Meagan Raker, directed by Melinda Beasi, with choreography by Connie Flachs and musical direction by Lemuel Gurtowsky.  
The script is entirely in verse, and the music has a classical sensibility, appropriate to the poem's victorian setting. It is a challenging, beautiful, and occasionally dark work, filled with rich, vivid language and fantastic imagery that must be evoked solely by its two young actresses and the small musical ensemble.  We're thrilled to be able to work with such fine young performers, and are anxious to match their commitment with equal care and dedication.    What We Need  
At Act Too Studio, we believe that the arts are vital to the health of our community and all the people in it.  To that end, one of the motivations always driving us has been to keep our services affordable for anyone with the will to move forward in the arts.  This means that we charge only what we need to operate on a very basic level. So when we realized that we wanted to try to offer this unique performance opportunity to Anna and Meagan, we also realized that we'd have to raise money to do it.  
Your donations will help us pay for rights to do the piece, rent performance space, build our small set, acquire period costumes, and pay technical and artistic staff, including the  choreographer, musical director, and musicians to support the talent of these two girls, and to help create something truly beautiful and empowering for them as young performers.

</h3>Everyone has a relationship with <i>Hamlet.</i>  It's one
 of the most studied, most produced, and (arguably) best pieces of 
English theatrical literature we have.  Shakespeare's done such 
incredible work presenting one of the most fully-realized depictions of 
the human psyche in the title character. But Hamlet's dominance of his 
play leaves only so much room for the other characters in his life- 
characters which, I believe, have just as much at stake as he does.<br/><br/>In my own study of <i>Hamlet, </i>I
 became excited and frustrated by Ophelia's place in the story and in 
the world of Denmark. What was her relationship with Hamlet like? How 
much did she know about the Ghost and its accusations? What did she see 
that drove her mad?<br/><br/>And
 so she shared the soliloquies. Lines were cut and re-assigned so that 
they became conversations: Ophelia talking Hamlet into bating the King 
with a play, the two of them debating the nature of mortality, and so 
on. And once she had this new life, her story became more interesting to
 me than his. It quickly became very clear that Ophelia was the heroine 
of a new story running parallel to Hamlet's.<br/><br/>The completed text of the play is a collage of <i>Hamlet,</i> my own verse, and a number of other plays in the canon: <i>The Winter's Tale, Twelfth Night, Richard II, Othello, King Lear, The Tempest, Love's Labour's Lost, Romeo and Juliet, </i><i>All's Well That Ends Well, </i>and<i> Cymbeline, </i>to
 name a few. Lovers of Shakespeare will find the words of their favorite
 plays echoed here, finding new and rich resonance from being placed in a
 new context.<br/><br/>Finally, it's my 
hope that the piece flows seamlessly and stands alone as a completely 
new piece of theatre, which tells the story of a young woman fighting to
 make her own place in the world.<i><br/><br/>- James Parenti<br/><br/></i><h1><i></i></h1>

</div><p>Following our incredibly successful production of <i>Catch Me If You Can</i> last spring, Tisch New Theatre (TNT) will mount another cross-departmental, cross-school musical for a one- weekend engagement in The Grand Hall this November, with this year’s show selection being Sondheim's <i>Company</i>.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, we intend to bring the NYU community together in an unprecedented way by bridging the gap between the many schools and departments within the university. Developing a cross-school musical of this size will give students, regardless of their field of study, the opportunity to exercise their passion for the arts with other students they would not normally interact with. West Side Story marked a great change in the way NYU students can collaborate together on a project with the cast containing students from four of NYU's schools.</p><p>The collaboration that happens when performers of these different backgrounds come together is something truly outstanding, with every single person bringing something completely unique to the process. This year, we have taken that idea of cross-school collaboration and have attempted to maximize its full potential, with students from six of NYU’s schools being represented in our cast and on our production team.</p><p>We truly want to make this the production that students can get behind and be proud of. We believe that the NYU community is ready for a project of this caliber to be a yearly tradition, and we are eager to share this with the NYU community this November.</p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>Tisch New Theatre (TNT) was born out of a pressing need for a participatory theatre outlet for all NYU students.

Developing a cross-school musical of this size will give students, regardless of their field of study, the opportunity to exercise their passion for the arts with other students they would not normally interact with. West Side Story marked a great change in the way NYU students can collaborate together on a project with the cast containing students from four of NYU's schools.The collaboration that happens when performers of these different backgrounds come together is something truly outstanding, with every single person bringing something completely unique to the process. This year, we have taken that idea of cross-school collaboration and have attempted to maximize its full potential, with students from six of NYU’s schools being represented in our cast and on our production team.We truly want to make this the production that students can get behind and be proud of. We believe that the NYU community is ready for a project of this caliber to be a yearly tradition, and we are eager to share this with the NYU community this November.Tisch New Theatre (TNT) was born out of a pressing need for a participatory theatre outlet for all NYU students.

Two of our six performances of 35MM will be ""Pay What You Can"" performances, meaning any amount is welcomed and appreciated.   While we're keeping prices affordable and including these low-cost initiatives, we are still compensating every artist for their time and talent.   Your contribution of any size to this campaign helps make that possible! We want to make it quick and easy for all of our patrons to help make 35MM a big success, so we're running this campaign. Every dollar counts when you make a donation to MTM!   A $10 contribution to 35MM via this campaign gets you a personalized photo thank you posted to our Facebook page and Twitter. And not just any photo.  We're MTM, so we'll go out and find something weird and awesome just for you! Think $10 can't help? Here are a few things $10 gets us: 
50-100 postcards
10 programs
A day of use for the Goodman Center's projector, which will display the 35MM photographs during the show. 
A few props

<h3><span>We are afraid of what we don't understand. What is hidden in the dark. It’s time to bring mental illness into the spotlight. Sharing our light through storytelling, we can stop the stigma and save lives.</span></h3>
<p>One in four adults and one in five youth in the United States lives with a mental illness in any given year. Yet the culture of our society is to sweep it under the rug and to speak in whispers when discussing mental health disorders.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This stigma prevents people from seeking treatment. Individuals fear discrimination at work, rejection from friends and family, even damage to their reputation - all because of an illness in their brain.

<p>We believe this needs to change - and that together, we can do it. </p>
<b><i>This Is My Brave - The Show</i></b>  was born of the idea that no one should be ashamed of talking openly about living with a mental illness. Instead we should be applauded for our bravery by allowing ourselves to be vulnerable in order to help other people know they are not alone.

Our success from year one of This Is My Brave provides us with the experience to do it all again only on a bigger scale with the show's message reaching triple the audience.
Our goal is to raise all the funds we need for 3 shows through this campaign, but if we're unable to do that, we will create other means of financing the shows through off-line fundraisers, reaching out for pro-bono services, or good old fashion bartering.   
  Other Ways You Can Help We understand if contributing financially isn't in the cards for you right now. There are plenty of other ways you can help! Would you be so kind as to consider: 
Sharing our campaign via email with your friends and family, telling them why it's important to you
Sending out a message on your social networks with our campaign link - Indiegogo has easy-to-use share tools!
Tell friends and family at in-person gatherings, share with colleagues at work
Post flyers about our campaign in your local library, coffee shops, cafes, anywhere people gather and would see it & potentially donate

And that's all there is to it.",6.0,1,"1 Campaign

<div>Since 1983, McMaster Musical Theatre (MMT) has been fostering the talents of individuals with a passion for performing arts, not only as actors or actresses, but also as musicians and technicians. Comprised primarily of members from the McMaster University community, but also with those around it, MMT consistently awes audiences with professional grade productions from many dedicated volunteers. in order to continue this trend of high caliber productions, we are seeking donations in whatever you or your business can provide, no matter the size. </div>
<div>These contributions, whether monetary or otherwise, will be put to good use throughout the entire production to enhance elements such as costuming, makeup, props, and audio-visual technologies, just to name a few. MMT is entering our 32nd season, and we know that it will be a memorable one. As an organization that prides itself on being one  of the longest lasting student-run clubs at McMaster, I would personally like to ensure that this organization continues to make a positive image both within McMaster, as well as Hamilton as a whole. </div>
<div>Matt Clarke (President, MMT)</div>
<div>For our campaign, we are looking to raise $2,500. This money will go towards costumes, props, set building materials, advertisement and many other technical elements. We have big dreams for this production and every dollar counts towards making it all a reality. If monetary support is not the way you want to go, we also would love any in-kind donations you would be willing to offer! We will happily create a package suited to whatever you can offer.

<div>Sweeney Todd is about human nature. At least in the sense that it explores <p>that it explores very common human emotions and reactions. Now, of course, as with all art (theatre and otherwise) these feelings and reactions are exaggerated; they're made into a larger than life representation of the real world. Through Sweeney Todd, we explore vengeance, fear and obsession. It reminds us to meter our responses in situations like those that Sweeney, Lovett, Judge Turpin, Anthony and Johanna face. </p>
<p>I can personally guarantee that this show will not only be worth seeing, but worth supporting as well. Our production team has spent the last few months working tirelessly to prepare for the show, even prior to casting.

The idea to adapt it into an original stage production had been on my mind for almost a decade. Now in my senior year of college, the decision to go forth with this entirely student-run, extra-curricular, non-profit production of the album that shaped my adolescence and formed the foundations of much of my personal beliefs has been the most cathartic experience of my life.</p><p>The Wall isn’t a very literal story. It’s an abstract journey that follows our protagonist Pink, born parallel to the murder of his father by the Nazis during World War II. His childhood in shambles, Pink begins to build a metaphorical wall between himself and what he perceives to be a cruel and heartless world.

The idea to adapt it into an original stage production had been on my mind for almost a decade. Now in my senior year of college, the decision to go forth with this entirely student-run, extra-curricular, non-profit production of the album that shaped my adolescence and formed the foundations of much of my personal beliefs has been the most cathartic experience of my life.The Wall isn’t a very literal story. It’s an abstract journey that follows our protagonist Pink, born parallel to the murder of his father by the Nazis during World War II. His childhood in shambles, Pink begins to build a metaphorical wall between himself and what he perceives to be a cruel and heartless world. While there are certainly unfair forces that work against him, his lack of responsibility and his willful neglection eventually trap him behind his wall. The variables he uses to cope – nostalgia, self-pity, and drugs – lead him down a path of extremism resulting in his transformation into the very fascist forces that killed his father in the first place.The fact is that The Wall is now more relevant than it has ever been since its release in 1979.

<h3>ReVisions Play | NYC Summerfest Premiere</h3>
<p><strong>By Gur Arie Piepskovitz</strong></p>
<p><i>The Director has a vision. Good. So does everybody else. With a motley crew of young actors and aging thespians, can he create meaningful theatre in a room bursting with egos, unrequited loves and raging jealousy? </i></p>
<p>Following a successful run at Camden People's Theatre in London, Gur Arie Piepskovitz (Writer/Director/Performer) has been selected to bring his show to the prestigious NYC SUMMERFEST,<i> a festival celebrating original full-length, one-act and solo theatre productions, where self-producing is the magic wand that feeds the core of art and creativity. </i></p>
<h3>About ReVisions:</h3>
<p>Re-Visions is a satirical, meta-theatrical play which investigates the power of role-playing in achieving the unrequited and how one alters reality only by perceiving it differently. The piece brings into the ring five different personas, each with its own monstrous ego, who will attempt to mimic reality, enhance it, or sometimes override it completely. And what better setting for this fistfight of conflicting desires than the ultimate enemy of reality- a theatre stage. Through fast- paced dialogues, exaggerated characters and banter, the play observes social issues in a provoking manner, incorporating documentary material with illusion.</p>
<h3>Feedback:</h3>
<p><i>A tangled web of perversity, history and the authentic! </i> - Simon Vincenzi, Arts Admin artistic resident, theatre director.</p>
<p><i>Extraordinary: funny, original, ridiculous, exhilarating and clever </i>- Hanna Berrigan, theatre director</p>
<p><i>Curiously unexpected and intriguing</i> - Jessica Ziskind, Programme Assistant, New Contemporaries</p>
<p><i>Gur Piepskovitz, director of Re-Visions and his team of performers brought to life a challenging and brave new work. This layered and challenging piece raised many questions that engaged the audience to think and seek answers for themselves. I was excited and consistently interested throughout and left wanting more </i>- Craig Leo is an associate puppetry director at War Horse</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal:</h3>
<p>Traveling from London to NYC for the ReVisions NY Premiere is thrilling and fantastical! But it's trans-Atlantic and involves some extra cost. We are raising $5000 for these production costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional Stage Manager</li>
<li>Rehearsal Space (2 Weeks)</li>
<li>Videographer/editing</li>
<li>Marketing (printing/shipping posters &amp; programs)</li>
<li>Set Design</li>
<li>Travel</li>
<li>Accommodation</li>
</ul>

<h3>It's Been One Year of Keeping Live Theatre ALIVE!</h3>
<p>On March 16th, 2020, the theatres and renaissance festivals went into lockdown. </p>
<p>On April 1st we did a show.</p>
<p>The Social Distancing Players was born with the sole mission of keeping live theatre alive - and we have. In our section of the internet, we've managed to stay connected with our audiences and keep theatrical professionals and ren faire actors semi-quasi-gainfully employed.</p>
<p>And we've done it all because of your help.</p>
<p>Over the last year we've done adaptations of your friendly, neighbourhood Shakespeare's ren faire stage shows: <i>12th Night and the 3 Bears!, Romeo &amp; Juliet: The Flying Implement of Doom Edition!, Julius Caesar: Beware the Ides of March of the Penguins!, The Tempest: A 3-Hour Tour (A 3-Hour Tour)!, Macbeth: Death by Fluffy Kittens!, The Hamlet X-mas in July Special!, Richard: 2 Fast, 2 Furious!, A Midsummer Night's Dream: A Gaye Olde Tyme!, Titus Andronicus: Ya Know - For Kids!, </i>and produced <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> and <i>Six Lovers in Florence </i>(and we also did <i>The Hamlet X-mas Special! </i>again, but in the holiday season). </p>
<p>12 shows. About 50 performers. And all because YOU were there for us, keeping us going in this time of murder hornets and Joe Exotic.</p>
<p>And now we want to celebrate our 1 year anniversary with you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We're Putting the Band Back Together!</h3>
<p>On Wednesday, April 14th, 2021, 1 year and 13 days after the original performance, the Social Distancing Players are performing <i>12th Night &amp; the 3 Bears: Take 2!</i> - it's (mostly) the same show with the original cast as we had in April of 2020, when we were all thinking that this would be over in 2 weeks, 3 months tops. And we've learned a lot in this last year. We've learned how to light ourselves properly for Zoom. We've learned how to maximize crappy internet connections. And we've learned how to have hope again.</p>
<p>As our performing spaces start to open back up, we're still performing with you here, in THIS venue where you get the best seat in the house, and we're going to keep this going. Maybe not quite as often as before, but the shows will go on(line), because we're here for you just as you've been here for us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Do We Need?</h3>
<p>We're looking for $1,200. That's $100 each for the professional performers from the theatre and renaissance festival communities who are performing the show for you, and with you. </p>
<p>That $100 each can buy groceries, or pay for a dental visit, or a phone bill, get your oil changed or your car inspected. It can go towards rent. It helps to keep these performers semi-quasi-gainfully employed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Parts Available</h3>
<p>One of my favorite parts of theatre is the interactivity it can have with the audience members - in fact, my stage shows are crafted to be able to play WITH the audience, with YOU as the performers. And so FOUR audience members will be able to play ""on-stage"" with the professional actors in this piece:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baby Bear</li>
<li>Mama Bear</li>
<li>Sir Toby Belch</li>
<li>Sir Andrew Aguecheek</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a $50 donation to have a part in the show, and only four slots are available - but don't worry! there are other perks, too!</p>
<ul>
<li>$30 gets you a signed copy of the performance script, mailed to your house by May 1.</li>
<li>$20 gets you a PDF of the performance script</li>
<li>$10 and you can join the cast ""backstage"" after the show in a private Zoom meeting</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Every Little Bit Helps</h3>
<p>Even if you can only spare a dollar, it helps. And if you can't spare the change, please share out this campaign.</p>
<p>We've been doing this for a year - and we're still all in this together.</p>

<h3><strong>a play written &amp; performed by Haley McGee</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>directed by Alisa Palmer</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>executive producer Derrick Chua            </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>as originally produced by Theatre Passe Muraille</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>original lighting, sound &amp; costume designs by Dave DeGrow, John Gzowski &amp; Cami Koo<br/></strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>i'm so glad you're here.</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Haley McGee, and I am an emerging Toronto-based writer and actor.  I created a solo show OH MY IRMA.  This campaign is to raise funds to assist me in taking this award-winning, critically acclaimed play on an international tour to Amsterdam, Wirksworth (UK), Moscow, New York City, Kiel (Germany).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>take a step back. tell me about this play.</strong></h2>
<p>""OH MY IRMA is the award-winning solo play by Canadian rising star <strong>Haley McGee, </strong>dubbed “<strong><em>the next darling of Canadian theatre</em></strong>” (<em>See Magazine)</em>.  Directed by Siminovitch Prize Finalist, Chalmers and Dora Award winning director <strong>Alisa Palmer</strong>, <strong>OH MY IRMA</strong> sees McGee bring the memorable Mission Bird, a socially inept young woman with an insatiable appetite for connection, to the stage in her hilarious and mesmerizing “<strong><em>tour de force</em></strong>” play.</p>
<p>A comedy with razor teeth, Mission Bird finds herself in front of an audience, defending an unnamable crime which YES, she committed, but it wasn’t her fault.  The story takes macabre turns and Mission Bird’s ardent defense crumbles as she comes closer to revealing to the audience what she’s done - who she’s killed. </p>
<p>Originating as a five-minute piece at an emerging artist cabaret at Toronto’s legendary <strong>Theatre Passe Muraille</strong>, <strong>OH MY IRMA</strong> was presented it to rave reviews and sold-out houses at the <strong>Edmonton International Fringe Festival</strong>, before its professional debut back at Theatre Passe Muraille. In Toronto it was met again with sold out and performances critical acclaim.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2011 the play was selected to be part of the <strong>United Solo Theatre Festival</strong>—an international solo show festival in <strong>NYC</strong>. I went to New York City, and performed OH MY IRMA <strong>off-Broadway</strong> at Theatre ROW.  It <strong>won Best Production</strong> of the 77 shows there and has now been invited to festivals around the globe.</p>
<p>I have been invited to perform OH MY IRMA at five festivals in Amsterdam, Wirksworth (UK), New York City, Moscow and Kiel (Germany).  I am emboldened, encouraged and thrilled by the hunger for this play around the globe.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>the ask</strong></h2>
<p>These festivals are full of innovative, sexy, cutting edge new performance.  I am thrilled and honoured to be invited to them with my show.  But as I am an emerging theatre artist, these festivals, though very cool, are not rich, and they don’t cover the costs of my travel nor my living expenses while I’m there. </p>
<p>I have put together a shoestring budget for a show and tour plan that are as modest and simple as possible.  I will travel alone, billet where possible and pinch pennies at every turn. </p>
<p>I will be on tour from September 3-November 17, 2012, with performances at festivals in five cities.  My entire budget is $15,000 and those funds will cover travel, accommodation, food on the road, marketing, publicity, promotions, festival fees and technical costs abroad. </p>
<p>I have applied to our arts councils at the national, provincial and local levels, and am pursuing corporate donations and sponsorships.  With this online campaign my goal is to raise a third of my budget.</p>
<p>I need your help. Financially.  ANYTHING YOU CAN GIVE IS AMAZING.  Check out my perks over there to the right.  It all helps and it's all important and I thank you effusively for even considering it.  (If you can't donate but want to help me out in other ways scroll down the bottom of this page for some suggestions.)</p>
<p>If you donate to the <em>OH MY IRMA</em> tour you are not only supporting me and my work as a Canadian theatre artist abroad but Canada’s reputation in the international theatre scene.  You are contributing to the development of a young voice in Canadian theatre by allowing me to take part of an international conversation with a milieu of the finest theatre artists in the world.  Presenting my work in an international context will make me a stronger artist and give me more to contribute to the arts community in Canada.  And beyond that, you are ensuring that this story keeps getting told.</p>

a play written & performed by Haley McGee
directed by Alisa Palmer
executive producer Derrick Chua            
as originally produced by Theatre Passe Muraille
original lighting, sound & costume designs by Dave DeGrow, John Gzowski & Cami Koo
 
i'm so glad you're here.
My name is Haley McGee, and I am an emerging Toronto-based writer and actor.  I created a solo show OH MY IRMA.  This campaign is to raise funds to assist me in taking this award-winning, critically acclaimed play on an international tour to Amsterdam, Wirksworth (UK), Moscow, New York City, Kiel (Germany).
 
take a step back. tell me about this play.
""OH MY IRMA is the award-winning solo play by Canadian rising star Haley McGee, dubbed “the next darling of Canadian theatre” (See Magazine).  Directed by Siminovitch Prize Finalist, Chalmers and Dora Award winning director Alisa Palmer, OH MY IRMA sees McGee bring the memorable Mission Bird, a socially inept young woman with an insatiable appetite for connection, to the stage in her hilarious and mesmerizing “tour de force” play.
A comedy with razor teeth, Mission Bird finds herself in front of an audience, defending an unnamable crime which YES, she committed, but it wasn’t her fault.  The story takes macabre turns and Mission Bird’s ardent defense crumbles as she comes closer to revealing to the audience what she’s done - who she’s killed. 
Originating as a five-minute piece at an emerging artist cabaret at Toronto’s legendary Theatre Passe Muraille, OH MY IRMA was presented it to rave reviews and sold-out houses at the Edmonton International Fringe Festival, before its professional debut back at Theatre Passe Muraille. In Toronto it was met again with sold out and performances critical acclaim.
In the fall of 2011 the play was selected to be part of the United Solo Theatre Festival—an international solo show festival in NYC. I went to New York City, and performed OH MY IRMA off-Broadway at Theatre ROW.  It won Best Production of the 77 shows there and has now been invited to festivals around the globe.
I have been invited to perform OH MY IRMA at five festivals in Amsterdam, Wirksworth (UK), New York City, Moscow and Kiel (Germany).  I am emboldened, encouraged and thrilled by the hunger for this play around the globe.
 
the ask
These festivals are full of innovative, sexy, cutting edge new performance.  I am thrilled and honoured to be invited to them with my show.  But as I am an emerging theatre artist, these festivals, though very cool, are not rich, and they don’t cover the costs of my travel nor my living expenses while I’m there. 
I have put together a shoestring budget for a show and tour plan that are as modest and simple as possible.  I will travel alone, billet where possible and pinch pennies at every turn. 
I will be on tour from September 3-November 17, 2012, with performances at festivals in five cities.  My entire budget is $15,000 and those funds will cover travel, accommodation, food on the road, marketing, publicity, promotions, festival fees and technical costs abroad. 
I have applied to our arts councils at the national, provincial and local levels, and am pursuing corporate donations and sponsorships.  With this online campaign my goal is to raise a third of my budget.
I need your help. Financially.  ANYTHING YOU CAN GIVE IS AMAZING.  Check out my perks over there to the right.  It all helps and it's all important and I thank you effusively for even considering it.  (If you can't donate but want to help me out in other ways scroll down the bottom of this page for some suggestions.)
If you donate to the OH MY IRMA tour you are not only supporting me and my work as a Canadian theatre artist abroad but Canada’s reputation in the international theatre scene.  You are contributing to the development of a young voice in Canadian theatre by allowing me to take part of an international conversation with a milieu of the finest theatre artists in the world.  Presenting my work in an international context will make me a stronger artist and give me more to contribute to the arts community in Canada.  And beyond that, you are ensuring that this story keeps getting told.

<h2>The Show</h2>
<p><em>Telemachus, Darling</em> is a tender exploration of the life of an eight-year-old boy following his father's death at sea during World War I. Twining together the dreams and realities of young Darling's life with episodes from the story of Odysseus's son, Telemachus, this play is a strange, poetic look at loss, its tolls and redemptions, in the lives of two young men. <br/><br/>An original story from playwright Patrick Barrett, <em>Telemachus, Darling</em> is the third collaboration between Barrett and director Carly Hoogendyk, following last summer’s <em>Dr. Apple's Last Lecture</em> (named a “Hot Show” of the 2011 Edinburgh Fringe by The Scotsman). Our design team is currently dreaming up and implementing plans for a multimedia yet tender style of storytelling. Design elements and staging will partner archive and fantasy to bring this extremely rich script to life. By interweaving narration with an evocative soundscape, live music, inventive staging, and projections of original  illustrations, we aspire to deploy an array of artistic tools to create a sensorily engaging and immediate theatrical experience.</p>

Rodriguez""Such an amazingly talented group of artists and a wonderfully creative collage of acts.  The show was charming and funny with wonderful moments of tenderness including the original song ""Fragile"".  This is a show and a group not to be missed. Absolutely delightful!""J. Murdock
 
""I think any artist would agree there is nothing more thrilling than collaboration.  The cabaret has been the most challenging and exciting experience I've had working with other performers.  The productions have been a chance to create anything, break the rules, break the forth wall, reach out and surprise the audience and ourselves.  It has been pure creation!""
 
Shanna Jones, singer/songwriter

""Working on the Cabaret with this powerful group of artists has truly been a blessing. The caliber of artists and their commitment to their craft is at the heart of why this project has been so successful. The Cabaret wasn’t just a wonderful presentation for an audience to witness, but a beginning of numerous creative collaborations among the artists.  I look forward to taking part in it for a long time to come.""Simón Hanukai, Director""I have worked for big Theatres and small ones and I have never encounter this kind of commitment and creativity like this before. These artists get into a room and magic happens. Words, sounds, colors and movements are coming together creating an unexpected story that gets you right there, between your lungs and your belly button and gives you chills all over.""MA Désy, Producer

<h3><strong>ABOUT SPACEMAN</strong></h3>
<p><strong>""We're all humans and the idea of sending one of our kind on a trip like that would be a wonderful adventure for the entire world. the whole world would get behind it.""</strong> <em><br/></em></p>
<p> - <em><a href=""http://www.thespacereview.com/article/669/1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">James McLane</a>, Former NASA engineer discussing a one-way, solo trip to Mars</em></p>
<p>In 2010, a bill was signed in the United States authorizing manned missions to the planet Mars by 2030s. But, the reality of such a trip comes with a catch - such a flight would take over eight months, would be performed solo and would offer no return trip.</p>
<p>In this brave and funny new play, the difficulties of interplanetary space travel are brought to life in exacting detail. Radiation exposure, long term weightlessness, low light, extensive communication delays and poor hygiene are just a few of the challenges astronaut Molly Jennis must face as the first to Mars. But she soon finds nothing compares to the psychological effects of having so much time alone. Time spent mulling over the decisions she has made and what might be waiting for her when she finally reaches her destination.</p>
<p>Spaceman simulates space travel for the stage using low light, a claustraphobic set and simulated micro-gravity. The play will also use an immersive sound design featuring works by experimental composers such as Kevin Drumm, Alva Noto, Daphne Oram, and Aiden Baker among others.</p>
<h3>WHY WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THIS PLAY</h3>
<p>We at Loading Dock love to take theatre beyond the upper-middle class living room.  Doing a play about surviving in outer space is exciting to us because it grapples with both science and mythology. This combination allows us to explore what is timeless in mankind: science always pushing us forward into new frontiers, while mythology keeps us bound to our primal urges, desires and loves that have existed since time began.  Making space and science theatrical and visceral is infinitely facinating to us -- we're never bored of working on this project!  Spaceman grapples with these ideas in meaningful and funny ways.</p>
<p>And the idea of transporting an audience to a completely  new world -- largly through our immersive sound design -- is just really freakin' fun. And check it out – this is a real, one way trip to Mars funded by reality TV!  Almost straight out of the script!</p>
<p>Contributing to this play will help us realize our design to the fullest extent.  We want to simulate micro-gravity and the vacuousness of space in the most realistic way possible.  That includes a fully realized space module complete with internal lighting and a life-like space suit (see the video!).  A full set will really help transport audiences out of the theatre and into the big empty void, where we want ‘em! </p>

But self-producing theater in NYC isn't easy.<br/><br/>Your support will go directly towards the mounting of our play, SPACEMAN. We are producing this on our own and need help paying for sets, lights and costumes.<br/><br/>The design is particularly important to the success of this play.

<p><a href=""http://www.loading-dock.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Loading Dock</strong></a> was formed by playwright/director Leegrid Stevens and actor Erin Treadway. The primary focus of Loading Dock is to create original plays that explore the extremes in human behavior. The company often juxtaposes ancient mythology with modern social thought and convention to explore the conflicted relationship of the modern man to his/her more primal instincts. While grounded in the traditions of realism, Loading Dock does not subscribe to a universal or stable reality but instead seeks to present the warped realities of its subjects as they perceive the world. These augmented realities are created using both traditional and innovative theatrical conventions. Avant-guarde and experimental techniques such as exploratory language, contradictory or non-linear narrative, video, and experimental sound are combined with the theatrical traditions of complex, emotionally expressive characters, recognition and reversal, and focus of action that were established by theatre's forbearers such as Sophocles, Anton Chekov, and Tennessee Williams.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I started this show over a year ago, workshopping the script with Eric Trules. In that workshop, a deadline was provided to get our shows completed: The Hollywood Fringe Festival. I did manage to pull it all together in time and presented my one man show, Blood Fruit, about how I came out to my Catholic Iraqi parents. The audience laughed and cried and the show was so well-received I even won BEST of the Hollywood Fringe! I was given an encore show at the Theatre Asylum, and then I embarked on producing the show on my own at the Lounge Theatre where I originally opened. I just had to cancel all future performances because the production is lacking in funds! Please help!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What's so special about my show is that people connect to it in very personal ways. When I see a play, I can tell the actors ""good job"", but it's hard to say how personal it was to see the show because the actor isn't the whole show. Blood Fruit is different. It is me telling my own life story. What the audience gets is my true story overcoming my own fears and my own challenges being gay. The result is that my audience can connect with material and with me. They learn more about themselves and how they can be different. The BEST example of this was a friend of mine who was so moved by the show he couldn't stand to greet me afterwards because he had to contemplate his relationship with his father (I opened before Father's Day, so it impacted him even more). He was inspired by my show to visit his father and try to make peace despite his rejection of my friend's sexuality. I keep hearing how inspiring my show it, and I have to continue to share it and inspire others!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This fundraiser will SAVE Blood Fruit and allow me to produce it again. Your donation will go directly towards all of the production costs, the space rental being the biggest. The first grand will go towards the next production and the second grand will be for the continuation of the show. I hope to take the funds submit the show towards more Fringe Festivals around the US. If I don't have enough by then I'll do whatever I need to to get it and let this show thrive. Help me make it happen! Of course, depending on your donation, you could receive something as well! Check it out!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>SPREAD THE WORD! Tell people about the show, especially if you've seen it. Most of my audience has come from word of mouth. Keep 'em coming! And if you know any people that work with the LGBT community or are themselves queer, tell them to donate! Tell everyone to donate! Let's do it!</p>

This fundraiser will SAVE Blood Fruit and allow me to produce it again. Your donation will go directly towards all of the production costs, the space rental being the biggest. The first grand will go towards the next production and the second grand will be for the continuation of the show. I hope to take the funds submit the show towards more Fringe Festivals around the US. If I don't have enough by then I'll do whatever I need to to get it and let this show thrive. Help me make it happen! Of course, depending on your donation, you could receive something as well! Check it out!


Other Ways You Can Help
SPREAD THE WORD! Tell people about the show, especially if you've seen it. Most of my audience has come from word of mouth. Keep 'em coming!

<p>Our Company prides itself on our collectivity and the empowerment of our peers by offering the opportunity for full-scale, fully funded, fully organized and realized Off-Off Broadway productions. </p>
<p>In this spirit we are proud to present company member Colby Day's Felix and The Diligence, a hilarious comedy set at sea with nazi spies, sea monsters, mistaken identities, romance, weird vibes and a mostly happy ending. <br/></p>

We (Collin Clay Chace and Seth Lepore) first started doing theatre together while attending an alternative high school in Providence, RI called School One. We were cast in a play called “Inside Al”. This script was about a man whose inner struggle with having cerebral palsy comes to a head as his inside self (played by Collin) gets completely fed up with how he presents his outside self (played by Seth) to the world. 

The Reunion Minus Male Pattern Baldness 

Twenty years later we started chatting about touring two new one-man shows together. We found that we’d been living parallel lives on different continents (Western Mass and London respectively), sharing similar solo performance trajectories and grappling with our own spiritual quests and emotional upheavals.  

Huge admirers of each other's work, we came together again to expand the boundaries of where theater can take an audience. Here's what our shows are all about:

The Rock N' Wrestle Roadshow

In Chace’s “one-man/multiple personality” Rock N Wrestle Roadshow, what we’re wrestling with is mental health. Yet the “funny folks” involved - from a multi-racial porn stud to an heiress-turned-peace activist to an 8-year-old poet – all eschew chat about diagnosis. 

Instead, they skip out of the hospital “crazy ward” to relay their unexpected conclusions about the curveballs life has thrown them. The show celebrates those folks who’ve been written off as deranged and affirms them as essential voices for social change. 

SuperHappyMelancholyexpialidocious

Following on the coat tails of his award-winning monologue Losing My Religion: Confessions of a New Age Refugee, Lepore continues with the second part of his trilogy on the underbelly of the self-help movement.  

Lepore explores the rise in popularity of the happiness industry across the American landscape through the trajectory of hysterical character-driven scenes, as well as autobiographical digests of his personal struggles.  Lepore uses his fecund observations of our fascinating hang-ups with happiness to expose the true cost of this ongoing pursuit. 
The Bottom LineThis is much more than two solo shows playing in one evening; it’s a collaboration that creates room for two autonomous experiences, mirroring back to the audience the craving we all have for community, even in the midst of xenophobic obstacles. 

The Double Trouble Tour Storms the Mid-West and Northeast

We got to work last February planning a 7 week tour with including stops in Boulder, Minneapolis, Chicago, NYC, Providence, Boston, Northampton and Brattleboro. Our good friend Karen Spies was enlisted to be our Business Manager as her experience as the CFO of the Boulder Fringe Festival and as a bookkeeper would be invaluable.

As of right now the tour is booked in several theaters in the Mid-West and NorthEast. All of these shows are self-produced which means we are doing all the work: booking the venue, hiring technicians, marketing the shows on a grassroots level and handling all the administrative duties. We are also generating some college gigs and other paid appearances through various arts presenters. Needless to say it’s a lot of work but we’re super excited about how it’s all coming together.

Where You Come In

Our project is fiscally sponsored through Fractured Atlas. That means contributions to our tour are tax-deductible to the full extent of the law (for U.S. bank account holders). We love being able to extend this benefit to our donors.

We will be asking everyone and their mother to help us achieve our goal of $10,000 for the 7 week tour. Renting the theaters, paying technical support, outsourcing some of the PR and marketing, liability insurance and transportation are a few of the many things that quickly add up. 

How You Can Help Us Live the Dream (Levels of Giving) 


$250- Graphic design services for our amazing posters, postcards and programs from paperandcloud.com

$500- Two nights of rental fees for a theater including technical assistance and box office help
$750- Full color Program/ Poster/ Postcard printing for the entire tour
$1000- Flyering and distribution services of posters and postcards for the entire tour
$2500- The cost of outsourcing our PR/Marketing campaign


What’s Next?

Check out the perks to the right and donate away. Any amount donated will be tax-deductible to the full extent of the law.

Thank you in advance for your generous support.

wheelchairs ready to dance. It always
takes a few minutes for me to realize that these are regular kids who just want
to DANCE and have FUN like their typically functioning peers. The
hour flies by and the joy and excitement
for the program is written in their smiles. The
joy spreads and follows them back to
their rooms and changes the perspective life of those present forever!"" -Richard Gormley,
ZES 

""We
are trying to get our children to move
because this accelerates the process of healing. Our hospital is strongly
committed to promoting wellness so we frequently recruit outpatients and
families to join in the Soaringwords
+ Zumba® Fitness classes each month. Parents that are here
for a long time really appreciate the opportunity to get out of their child's
hospital room and have fun and be with other
people and dance. It's a tremendous motivator for our staff who do so much to
care for others, this
is the one hour each month that we can take care of ourselves."" -
Darlene Kelly, Director Recreation Therapy/Child Life
Department, Shriners Hospitals for Children,
Chicago

<p> </p>
<p>Have you ever watched a dance or theatre performance and think to yourself, ""I wish I could do that!"" Well, wish no more! Alexa Luthor, of Green Mountain Cabaret, and Aeshna Mairead, of Silk Lotus Dance, are teaming up to create Soul Fire Studio, a place for all to openly indulge in burlesque, belly dance, hooping, yoga, improv, stand up, sketch, and much, much more! But before we can offer such fantastic classes, we need your help... yes YOU! Help us build a home for the arts so we can share our passion for performance with you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About This Campaign:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>With your generous contribution, you will help secure and build an all-inclusive performing arts studio, where anyone with passion can learn and practice the style of expression they desire in a comfortable and judgment-free zone or rent a rehearsal space. All contributions will go towards renting our studio in the South End of Burlington and paying the utilities for our first few months.  Contributions will also be used in obtaining the necessities to help make the space more welcoming and user-friendly. Only you have the power to help us create a home for the artistic community to bare its soul!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are looking for $10,000 total, to cover two month's rent, utilities, purchasing of items necessary to everyday operations like internet and phone, and to fund the installation of the lower level classroom flooring. If we don't reach our goal, whatever funds we do accumulate will still go towards the payment of as much of the monthly rental/utility fees/flooring costs as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Besides the perks from your donation, you will have access to learn in a welcoming space where we plan to run unique dance and theatre classes taught by educated professionals. Here are just a few of the great teachers you can expect to take classes with at Soul Fire Studio:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>~Alexa Luthor: Classically-trained in ballet for 19 years at Vermont Ballet Theatre School, Alexa moved out to Chicago to pursue graduate school and instead ended up falling in love with burlesque. She trained and graduated from Studio L'Amour, a prestigious burlesque studio in Chicago, IL. She then joined the cast of Boobs of Khan: A Star Trek Burlesque with Gorilla Tango Burlesque and later, Kiss Kiss Cabaret, premiere burlesque companies located in Chicago. She moved back to Vermont (because frankly, she missed it) to start her own company, Green Mountain Cabaret, a neo-burlesque variety show that performs monthly at Club Metronome. She is looking forward to teaching men and women burlesque, adult ballet, and more!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>~Aeshna Mairéad: Aeshna has been belly dancing since 2010 in the Burlington, VT area. Fascinated with the art form since seeing belly dancers at the renaissance faire as a teenager but never having the opportunity to pursue it, she was finally able to find a belly dance fitness class in the summer of 2010. This class led her to other teachers in the area and she began studying American Cabaret, Improvisational Tribal Style, and Tribal Fusion. Aeshna also has experience in Turkish Romany dance.</p>
<p>Aeshna received her General Skills for ATS® and Teacher Training I and II Certifications in Atlanta, GA in 2012. She is a FatChanceBellyDance® Sister Studio. Aeshna has a great passion for American Tribal Style® and one of her greatest joys is found in building the community of dancers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>~Dustin Bruley: Dustin Bruley is a native Vermonter who studied improv for 4 years at Saint Michael's College. In addition to Saint Michael's, he has performed improv at the Waterfront Theater at Main Street Landing, the FlynnSpace, the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in New York City, and at private events. He is also a founding member of local improv troupe People With Faces. He has taught improv for Diversity Arts, the Burlington School District, and Milton High School.</p>
<p>He has performed as a puppeteer for The PuppeTree, a puppet company based out of Thetford, VT, intermittently since 2011. In this capacity, he has constructed and performed with a variety of styles of puppets. This position has brought him into schools, libraries, and theaters in 6 states around the northeast. He has taught puppetry in classes lasting several hours, several days, several weeks, or several months, in various circumstances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>~Vienna Velvette: Vienna, as her name might suggest, has been enthralled by and involved with music since her mother's womb where she listened to her father play on stage while her mother ran lights while on tour. She was destined to be an artist even before she could understand the definition of one.</p>
<p>For many years, she took to the stage as a vocalist and actress, performing with several musical theater companies and attending North Carolina School of the Arts, where she majored in Opera and double majored in Wigs &amp; Makeup. Vienna has had the privilege to work with and under the direction of Marion Pratnicki and Glenn Siebert for Voice and the amazingly talented and renowned Martha Ruskai for Wigs &amp; Make Up. She has been involved with over 175 theater productions off and on stage including the Millennium Celebration at The Kennedy Center under the direction of James Allbritten, and Bizet's Carmen where she assisted Martha Ruskai under the direction of former Metropolitan Opera stage director, Bodo Igesz.  After over 20 years of performing, Vienna has finally found her home in cabaret and burlesque.  ""The perfect trifecta of performance art, it encompasses everything I've learned over the years... sass, class, and seduction."" </p>

She has been teaching ballet to children ages 3 to 12-years-old since the fall of 2009.  In the summer of 2011, she was hypnotized by some amazing hoop dancers.
