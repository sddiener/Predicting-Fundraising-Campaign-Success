The feeling of this board is quite different to the others as the front and back wheels are all pulling at the same time. This, combined with the centered position of the batteries on both sides of the deck makes you feel like a serious machine is under your feet. It is. The extra weight makes for a very comfortable, smooth ride. The main benefit of the 4WD is the capability to do what you never thought was possible on an electric skateboard.

</h3><h3><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong></h3><p><strong>Q. How far will the Electric Bike go on a charge?</strong></p><p>A. Depending on terrain and power level settings usually 20-25 miles.</p><p><strong>Q. How much do they weigh?</strong></p><p>A. The bikes all weigh about 70 LBS with batteries installed.</p><p><strong>Q. Can I ride in water?</strong></p><p>A. Our Electric Bikes are water resistant for rain and general use. Obviously, electronics and water don’t mix. Especially SALT WATER. Riding on the beach is okay, but stay out of the water. Warranties do not cover any damage caused by water of any type.</p><p><strong>Q. What is the weight limit of these bikes?</strong></p><p>A. The bike design has a max rider weight of 399 lbs.</p><p><strong>Q. Can these bikes be ridden on the highway?</strong></p><p>A. The bikes can be ridden anywhere a bicycle can legally operate. They are not legal to operate on limited access roadways in most states. They are classified as bicycles and not mopeds or motorcycles.</p><p><strong>Q. How does the warranty work?</strong></p><p>A. If you experience a problem, you must contact us before any repairs are made to the bike. We will then instruct you on the repair or coordinate with a bicycle repair facility nearest you for completing service if you are unable to do so. (Transporting bike to a facility is NOT covered by the warranty).  If you are capable of, and elect to make the repairs yourself, you must send us the faulty parts before we can send you new ones. We will direct you on diagnostics etc. Do not open or disassemble any electronic component under any circumstance. No user serviceable parts are inside of them. Do not attempt to cut or splice wiring under any circumstance.</p><p><strong>Q. What service do the bikes require?</strong></p><p>A. Bicycles, like any other equipment require periodic service and inspections. Your bike may require more or less service depending upon where and how you ride. Off road use will require much more periodic and in-depth service due to the dirty conditions that it will encounter. Head and chain bearing inspections, wheel bearing inspections and adjustment, tire inspections, spoke adjustments, chain lubrication and or replacement, brake adjustments are just a few of the inspections and service the bike may need over its lifetime.</p><p><strong>Q. Does my bike have a title?</strong></p><p>A. The bikes are sold with a bill of sale / receipt. They do have serial numbers stamped on the bottom of the bottom bracket or the front lower edge of the neck if you wish to record and or register your bike for insurance etc. No license is required other than that which may be required by local municipalities in some areas.</p><p><strong>Q. Are parts readily available?</strong></p><p>A. Yes! We carry a stock of all components for these bikes as well as most common parts such as pedals, grips, brake levers and parts, derailleur parts, crank sets, chains are readily available in the market place. We are also developing an affiliate sales network that will be able to supply parts.</p><p><strong>Q. Are accessories available?</strong></p><p>A. Yes, we have several accessories available and several in development.  Rear spring racks, front sportsman (gun, bow, fishing) racks as well as locks, lighting, bells etc. are available and we are working on a golf bag towing set up and several other surprises.  Stay tuned!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","Innovators In the Fat Tire Electric Bike Industry Since 2013

<p>Tideline has been operating a commuter ferry service between the Berkeley Marina and Pier 1.5 since March 2017.</p>
<p>We have received many requests to extend our service to other locations, like <strong>Jack London Square to San Francisco's Pier 40</strong>.  Our riders have described our service as....</p>
<p>""a life changing experience""</p>
<p>""a favorite part of the day""</p>
<p>""refreshing and invigorating"" </p>
<p>Tideline would like more people to experience a friendly, fast and affordable commute, that is why we are crowdfunding more lines of service between Berkeley and San Francisco</p>
<p>We are pre-selling monthly passes at $325 and one Roundtrip Tickets at $9.  We need $7,000 to launch, but more importantly we need committed riders to keep the service going.</p>
<p><u><strong>Here is the proposed schedule:</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Oakland Departures:  </strong>                                                          <strong>San Francisco  Departures:</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Each one-way trip takes 25-30 minutes between the Oakland's Jack London Square and Pier 40, South Beach District of San Francisco (including boarding and disembarking).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hello, My name is Louis Bricker. I am as stated above, a senior at the Steward School in Henrico Virginia. I recently turned 18 years old on May 30th. I live in Richmond with my loving mother Janet Scagnelli. My sister lives in South Carolina and is teaching a 5th-grade classroom. Just recently my family suffered a huge loss; that loss is my own father, Stephen Bricker,  a well respected and loving man. The disease which claimed my father's last breath left me and my family broken. This horrible disease which goes by the name of MSA is a disease which attacks the brain and slowly brings huge amounts of pain and also slows movement. When my family adopted me they owned a sports car which was a 1992 Miata in a bright red color scheme. My father babied that car and loved it until the sad day he was forced to sell it so he could take care of my sister Melina and I. My mother forced my father to sell the Miata when she realized he could only drive one of us kids at once and it was impossible for him to pick me and my sister up from school. Now after losing my father I searched and thought for many hours on what meant something to him and found it. The 1992 Miata was his pride and joy. I would like to bring that pride and joy to my mother in my senior project. </li>
<li>I am asking for 6 thousand dollars to not only purchase the car but to have enough money for maintenance and anything else needed for the car itself. I will be buying the car and fixing it up so it looks just like the one my father bought back in the day. I will not only be fixing but I will also be taking care of and painting the vehicle to match the old one my mom and dad loved so dearly. The purpose of my Senior project is to bring a smile to my mother's face and have her remember all of the good moments she spent with my father in his 1992 Miata. </li>
<li>I miss the smiles my mother and father used to exchange and would really like to see it again so I am asking for money to try and make that wonderful smile appear yet again on my mothers gleaming face.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am asking for $6000. This money will be going to the purchase of an old Miata, any replacement of parts for the vehicle, maintenance of the vehicle and any extra will be for parts which will make the car safer and more to my mothers liking. The goal is to finish this project by May of 2018 and to present my mother with her new car.</li>
<li>If I am unable to reach my goal of $6000 within the 40 day period the money I do make will still go towards the Miata. Any money I make is added to the money I get from working at Buz &amp; Ned's on West Broad street. </li>

Risks & Challenges  We are confident we can make this happen, but then again, so is everyone...  We have a solid Bluetooth circuit design that we have been shipping for nearly a year and we will be building up from this.
Our manufacturing partner for this product is the same company we work with today. We will be using silicon rubber for the control housing and we have not done this before, although our manufacturing partner has.
The circuit board redesign to re-position the switches will require a new FCC certification.
There is still a little hesitation when people hear ""bone conduction"" but this is getting better and usually goes away once they try it.    Other Ways You Can Help So maybe you don't ride a motorcycle...  Send this to someone you know who does, or to a friend who knows someone who rides. Participate but selecting one of our existing products as a perk   What We Have So Far...This is our vision for how the control would sit on the side of the helmet:                             
This is our mocked up prototype using one of our existing Bluetooth headsets:

<h4><b></b></h4><p><b><b><i>Simplicity Above All Else</i></b></b></p><p>Son of a Hitch fills the need for safe and easy vehicle recovery, which can be confidently set up and used by the average Joe or Jane to tug their light vehicle out. This is groundbreaking technology that can get you out of some of the worst road or off road situations, and should be part of everybody's car emergency kit.</p><p>We made the Son of a Hitch for the outdoors man and families who like to enjoy off road sports but have no safe way of recovering their ATV’s or side by sides when they get stuck. The Son of a Hitch is safe and reliable, but more suitable for pulling smaller vehicles, and much more practical for the average car owner.</p><p><b><i>Nothing Is Safer</i></b></p><p>There is nothing else like Son of a Hitch available to the average outdoor enthusiast at the moment. It is a unique product for small quad towing with no other competing products on the market. Typically, chains, tow ropes with hooks, shackles and tow balls are used in emergency vehicle recovery when a tow truck is not available. These improvised tools are dangerous and are known to snap or unexpectedly disconnect, causing injuries, damages and even fatalities.</p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437511181/dqrgcrswowmurb8xs99b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p><br/></p><b></b><p></p><b></b><p><b><i>Nothing Is Stronger</i></b></p><p>Strength tested at 35,000 lbs, the Son of a Hitch has a 4:1 safety factor, stamped at 8,000 lbs. The Son of a Hitch can be shock loaded at 8,000 lbs for one million cycles before it needs to be re-certified (this will not happen in your lifetime). The Son of a Hitch can be shock loaded with 3 ft runs to ensure optimum safety. It is no longer necessary to unsafely recover a vehicle using chains, slings with tail chains, tow ropes with hooks, trailer balls and shackles. With the Son of a Hitch users are able to eliminate the use of these hazardous towing mechanisms that were never intended to support the forces required to free a stuck vehicle.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p></p><h4><b></b></h4><p><b><i>Versatile</i></b></p><p>Son of a Hitch can be lifesaving, particularly for those who work in remote locations or go off road frequently. Son of a Hitch will be an indispensable tool for:</p><ul>
<li><p>➔Outdoor enthusiasts such as hunters, fishermen, campers and off-roaders</p></li>
<li><p>➔Those who work in mining, forestry, the seismic industry, and surveyors, where off road travel is frequent</p></li>

</b><p>Using the Son of
a Hitch system is the safest way to get your vehicle out of tough situations.
Fully equipped and ready for vehicle recovery, this complete system comes with
2 Son of a Hitch units, the Fuse Link Recovery Strap, Snap Trap, 2 Quick Links
and a Son of a Hitch System Carry Bag.  </p>
<p>The system works
by bringing together a recovery vehicle and a stuck vehicle by inserting a Son
of a Hitch into each of their standard 1 ¼” frame mounted receivers (or a 2""x 2"" receiver with Adapter) and attaching them with the Fuse Link strap secured with
the Snap Trap. With both the recovery vehicle and stuck vehicle equipped with a
Son of a Hitch, it will ensure a safe recovery as the units can withstand the
massive force needed to pull out a stuck vehicle.</p>

This is groundbreaking technology that can get you out of some of the worst road or off road situations, and should be part of everybody's car emergency kit.We made the Son of a Hitch for the outdoors man and families who like to enjoy off road sports but have no safe way of recovering their ATV’s or side by sides when they get stuck. The Son of a Hitch is safe and reliable, but more suitable for pulling smaller vehicles, and much more practical for the average car owner.Nothing Is SaferThere is nothing else like Son of a Hitch available to the average outdoor enthusiast at the moment. It is a unique product for small quad towing with no other competing products on the market. Typically, chains, tow ropes with hooks, shackles and tow balls are used in emergency vehicle recovery when a tow truck is not available. These improvised tools are dangerous and are known to snap or unexpectedly disconnect, causing injuries, damages and even fatalities.Nothing Is StrongerStrength tested at 35,000 lbs, the Son of a Hitch has a 4:1 safety factor, stamped at 8,000 lbs. The Son of a Hitch can be shock loaded at 8,000 lbs for one million cycles before it needs to be re-certified (this will not happen in your lifetime). The Son of a Hitch can be shock loaded with 3 ft runs to ensure optimum safety. It is no longer necessary to unsafely recover a vehicle using chains, slings with tail chains, tow ropes with hooks, trailer balls and shackles. With the Son of a Hitch users are able to eliminate the use of these hazardous towing mechanisms that were never intended to support the forces required to free a stuck vehicle.VersatileSon of a Hitch can be lifesaving, particularly for those who work in remote locations or go off road frequently. Son of a Hitch will be an indispensable tool for:
➔Outdoor enthusiasts such as hunters, fishermen, campers and off-roaders
➔Those who work in mining, forestry, the seismic industry, and surveyors, where off road travel is frequent
Son of a Hitch is light and easy to use, accessible to anybody, including beginners. Assemble Son of a Hitch within 5 minutes and be confident that your vehicle is securely attached for safe vehicle recovery.PREVENT INJURIES

COMMON INJURIES

Common injuries experienced with vehicle
recoveries are due to drivers, passengers or bystanders being struck by flying
metal objects such as hooks, chains, trailer balls or shackles used in the towing system. 


SHOCK LOAD READY

The Son of a Hitch is designed to withstand the shock load of a
vehicle recovery operation.

What is Shock load?  Most times shock loading is the necessary evil needed to free a stuck vehicle.  Shock load is a sudden increase of load that
has a hammering effect on your equipment. Shock loading can instantly increase
the load beyond the capabilities of traditional towing equipment and cause
accidents.
FUNCTION

Removable
U-bar allows for use of Son of a Hitch Fuse Link Recovery Straps.

Removing the pin and sliding the
Son of a Hitch’s U-bar off the stock allows you to slip a Son of a Hitch Fuse
link recovery tow strap through the U-bar securely mounted to the
vehicle(s) or quad(s). Once properly inserted into the U-bar, the towing strap
is safely locked into the unit. Using the Son of a Hitch with our Fuse
Link strap eliminates the danger of flying metal objects while recovering
a stuck vehicle.

PIVOT DESIGN

Patented
Pivoting Design prevents dangerous side-loading

The U-bar swivels on a specially
engineered high-tensile steel pin. The pivoting design ensures the load is
always transmitted evenly from the towing strap to the pulling vehicle to
eliminate side-loading. The broader surface of the U-bar helps protect the eye
of the towing strap. Our patented pivoting design provides over 180º of
rotation, which prevents dangerous side-loading.
ALUMINUM

Solid
Aluminum construction is lighter and stronger than steel

Both the U-bar and Stock of the
Son of a Hitch are composed of solid marine-grade aluminum. Due to it’s unique
design, preliminary testing has shown the aluminum Son of a Hitch has a 15% greater
load capacity than steel.  
FABRICATION

Crafted
to the Highest standards using the finest materials

The Son of a Hitch unit will be precision
machined and will be completely weldless and
seamless. The two specially designed pins are attached together by a
plastic-coated stainless steel galvanized 3/16″ aircraft cable to
prevent pin loss and fumbling for loose pins. The Son of a Hitch will be made
in Canada and USA by certified machinists and industry professionals. The Son
of a Hitch will not mass-produced. They will be batch produced with the highest
quality source materials.





DURABILITY

All-weather
materials brush off the harshest conditions

The primary components of the Son
of a Hitch will be made of aluminum which is impervious to corrosion from the
elements. The pins will be composed of galvanized, corrosion-resistance,
high-tensile steel. The Son of a Hitch is an heirloom product and will provide
years and years of all-weather service and will outlast the quad, atv or
vehicle it’s attached to.

REWARDS:Son of a Hitch to Son of a Hitch
Using the Son of
a Hitch system is the safest way to get your vehicle out of tough situations.
Fully equipped and ready for vehicle recovery, this complete system comes with
2 Son of a Hitch units, the Fuse Link Recovery Strap, Snap Trap, 2 Quick Links
and a Son of a Hitch System Carry Bag.  
The system works
by bringing together a recovery vehicle and a stuck vehicle by inserting a Son
of a Hitch into each of their standard 1 ¼” frame mounted receivers (or a 2""x 2"" receiver with Adapter) and attaching them with the Fuse Link strap secured with
the Snap Trap. With both the recovery vehicle and stuck vehicle equipped with a
Son of a Hitch, it will ensure a safe recovery as the units can withstand the
massive force needed to pull out a stuck vehicle.
Snap Trap Kit
Connecting each
Son of a Hitch unit is a Fuse Link strap. 
The Fuse Link strap is guaranteed to be the weakest part in the system
hence the name “Fuse Link”. Use of the strap ensures no metal objects will be
dislodged that could cause harm or damage to personnel and equipment. This 1” x
25’ strap is 100% nylon UV protected with a stretch of 8%. It will store 80-85%
of the energy generated in a shock load situation. The breaking point for this
strap is 8,000 lbs.The Snap Trap
is a kinetic energy diffuser that will capture a failed vehicle recovery strap
or winch line which could cause injury to persons or equipment damages.  The Snap Trap is not to be used as the primary recovery strap.  The
Fuse Link strap or winch line is threaded through the loops of the Snap Trap
and tied off to a secondary location on both vehicles using the Quick
Links.  No more flying accessories.The Snap Trap Kit comes with one Fuse Link 1"" x 25' nylon recovery strap, one Snap Trap, 2 Quick Links and one Snap Trap Carry Bag. 


Adapter


Some
light weight vehicles on the market come equipped with a standard 2x2 receiver.
By using the Adapter you can reduce the 2” receiver down to the same size as
the 1 ¼” Son of a Hitch.  The Adapter
comes equipped with a 5/8” pin to secure the Adapter into the receiver.  Included free for early Backers!

<h3>About</h3>
<p>We have been manufacturing custom electric bikes for a couple of years and this brought us to  the idea to make something different and unusual. We don't try to make something incredible, we just like things which have a good and attractive design, and we like to bring our ideas to life.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473243472/tmjjh7uvzexbl0vzlmkw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The ESnail  is much smaller than an ordinary bike, it's length is only 145cm.  and it's weight is just 18kg. It's easy to carry and it doesn't take up much space for storage. In the rear wheel we have integrated an 500w brushless hub motor with max power of 600w, it has enough powerful to climb uphill. The top speed of the ESnail is 30kmh. and in one charge it can go as far as up to 45km. In the frame, there is an integrated 36V 13Ah Li-ion Panasonic battery with more than 1000 recharge cycles, LCD display and thumb throttle, front V brakes, rear disk brakes. The ESnail has great looking lightning, powerful 8w front and rear LED lights and an amazing looking under frame light. Sometimes we get a question from different types of people - ""why there is no pedals?"" , but after their first ride they never ask us about it again. After their first ride, everyone comes back with a wide smile on their faces, and their first and main question is - I love it, can I go again?</p>
<p>You can choose whatever colour you want your ESnail to be!</p>
<p>Available colors are:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>To recharge an empty battery with 2A charger will take up to 7 hours, and with 5A charger it will need less than 3 hours to charge. To fully recharge an empty battery will cost less than 0.1€! Battery life time is more than 1000 cycles, which is more than 30000km, and even if you recharge the battery more than 1000 cycles, you still can ride the ESnail, but just with reduced range by 20-30%. Battery can reach more than 2000 cycles overall, new replacement Panasonic battery price is 220€.</p>
<p>We have work experience of 5 years in designing and manufacturing the extraordinary ebikes, this experience had helped us to design and manufacture the ESnail. The biggest challenge was to accommodate all of the components to the small frame, but it has already been done. In pictures you see the first generation ESnail, next generation ESnail will have new improvements such as integrated in rear wheel brushless hub motor and LCD screen.</p>

<p>This campaign will help us to change peoples attitudes to the bikes, our mission is show the world that the extraordinary things can be useful and practical.</p>

We have been manufacturing custom electric bikes for a couple of years and this brought us to  the idea to make something different and unusual. We don't try to make something incredible, we just like things which have a good and attractive design, and we like to bring our ideas to life.

The ESnail  is much smaller than an ordinary bike, it's length is only 145cm.  and it's weight is just 18kg. It's easy to carry and it doesn't take up much space for storage. In the rear wheel we have integrated an 500w brushless hub motor with max power of 600w, it has enough powerful to climb uphill. The top speed of the ESnail is 30kmh. and in one charge it can go as far as up to 45km. In the frame, there is an integrated 36V 13Ah Li-ion Panasonic battery with more than 1000 recharge cycles, LCD display and thumb throttle, front V brakes, rear disk brakes. The ESnail has great looking lightning, powerful 8w front and rear LED lights and an amazing looking under frame light. Sometimes we get a question from different types of people - ""why there is no pedals?"" , but after their first ride they never ask us about it again. After their first ride, everyone comes back with a wide smile on their faces, and their first and main question is - I love it, can I go again?
You can choose whatever colour you want your ESnail to be!
Available colors are:
 White
 Yellow
 Blue
 Red
 Green
 Black
 
To recharge an empty battery with 2A charger will take up to 7 hours, and with 5A charger it will need less than 3 hours to charge. To fully recharge an empty battery will cost less than 0.1€! Battery life time is more than 1000 cycles, which is more than 30000km, and even if you recharge the battery more than 1000 cycles, you still can ride the ESnail, but just with reduced range by 20-30%. Battery can reach more than 2000 cycles overall, new replacement Panasonic battery price is 220€.
We have work experience of 5 years in designing and manufacturing the extraordinary ebikes, this experience had helped us to design and manufacture the ESnail. The biggest challenge was to accommodate all of the components to the small frame, but it has already been done. In pictures you see the first generation ESnail, next generation ESnail will have new improvements such as integrated in rear wheel brushless hub motor and LCD screen.

This campaign will help us to change peoples attitudes to the bikes, our mission is show the world that the extraordinary things can be useful and practical.

What you get ?
Ready to drive next generation unique design ESnail for low price.

<h3>What is Dirty Billy?</h3>
<p>Some of you know what I’ve been up to but for the rest; Here goes.</p> <p><strong>First</strong> and foremost - Dirty Billy is a community garage and co-working space that will be located in the Bushwick/Ridgewood area of NYC. A workshop and shared parking garage with a bit different concept than you may have seen. A secure environment but also a creative and inviting co-working garage designed and built for the adventurous and demanding NYC motorcyclist. Parking and wrenching on your motorcycle is a hassle in NYC to say the least. We want to be a part of the solution.</p>
<p>Dirty Billy will host not only full time spaces but also hourly lift and day rates. We’ll be able to do some projects for you if you like and one of the coolest aspects of the shop will be the learning platform that we’re developing. For those of you that are interested in learning how to maintain and customize your own ride we will have workshops to help you along the way. Think basic maintenance and changing your tires, to custom projects like building your cafe bike, tracker or vintage restoration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Second</strong> is our look. This is where I think we step out from under the predisposed notion of a garage. For us motorcycles aren’t just transportation. They have seeped into our bloodstream. It’s what we do, think about and surround ourselves with every minute of our free time. Any way we can.</p>
<p>I see Dirty Billy as part gallery too. I love all of the moto centric art that’s out there but it’s scattered about and I want to bring it closer together in one space. A modular gallery to showcase the amazing artwork from in and around the motoring community will be in the space at all times. I thought, “What better place to have it then around a bunch of bikes, builds and all the people that would love to support the artists that document our obsession with these machines.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, and most important is our community, Dirty Billy will be a hub, a jump off point for our rider groups, organizing adventures and a non judgmental space. We have a few places that we gather now as riders in New York and we love them dearly. We are building Dirty Billy to add our name to that short list.</p>
<p><i>A space to learn, wrench, ride and get a little Dirty.</i></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Being that we’ve decided to build a community garage.  What better way than to have it crowdfunded by the community that it serves. <strong>This really is your garage. </strong>This crowdfunding campaign is the test to see if there’s a place for Dirty Billy in the NYC riding community. I want to build it for us and I need you to let me know it should be done.</p>
<p><strong>On to the fun stuff.</strong></p>
<p>As well as the obvious pre-sale of full time spaces and hourly packages we've curated some early bird as well as other awesome perks and thank you gifts for your generous support in making Dirty Billy real. More will be released as we go along and most are limited to a finite number so, if something catches your eye, make sure you snag it up before it's gone! Keep checking the perks sidebar and we'll keep updating it. </p>
<p>We’ll be sending out a bunch of updates to keep you posted on new stuff and an event that we’re planning too so if you have another minute (<i>after you donate of course</i>) head over to <a href=""https://www.dirtybilly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dirtybilly.com</a> and sign up for the <a href=""https://www.dirtybilly.com/contact/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mailing list</a>, like our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/DirtyBillyGarage/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook</a> page, and follow along on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dirtybilly_bk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">instagram</a>.

<h3>Why Diva</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This project was born from the meeting of ""Pro-Lite advanced composites technology"" and ""Giulio Paz Design"". In ten years we have worked on many projects, mainly in the field of nautical and motorcycles competition. <br/>Most of all we share the passion for motorcycles and so we decided to converge our skills in this project.</p>
<p>We want push over this project, before to start production. To go further in this direction, going up in riding performance, safety and style.</p>
<p>This will be possible to do by extending the use of carbon fiber from the bodywork to the frame and swingarm and, where is useful, to all the structural parts. Through an innovative design in the motorcycle field. This will give a lighter overall weight, for the body and the for not suspended masses. Also a greater stiffness, where it's needed. <br/>With a better yield of all components.<br/>Which will result in an exceptional riding precision, better braking, better acceleration, better cornering grip, super handling, and consequently an improved safety. </p>

<p>First of all we rethink  the man-machine interface, crossing the classic schemes. The position is inspired by the first decades of last century's motorbike, and picking something from off-road saddle.

<p> </p>
<p>The other advantage is the carbon fiber large use, extended to all structural parts, to get lightness and great reactivity, with strong benefits for all motorcyle dynamics.

<h3>The Rideshare industry is fragmented, and needs to change!</h3>
<p>The leading Transportation Network Companies (TNC) have lowered riders fares to unsustainable levels, while taking extremely high commission rates, anywhere between 20% to 28% per ride. When you factor in all cost to operate a vehicle, a driver is only making $0.06 to $0.07 per mile.</p>
<p>At Rhyd our team has over 10 years of commercial transportation, TNC, and Telematics  consulting and fleet management experience in the Bay Area.  When we came across these figures, we knew there is a need to build a platform to fix the exploitation of drivers pay. </p>
<p>The success of the major TNC companies has been at the expense and financial livelihood of drivers, who are making below minimum wage. There is a growing need to fix this problem and to bring transparency and to inform riders, drivers, and government regulatory bodies of  the questionable and unethical strategies the major TNC practice with no regards to social welfare and sustainablility.</p>
<p>With your support, we can build a rideshare platform that is fair for everyone, not just for a handfull of investors. At Rhyd we have only one mission, and that is to ask you to Rethink How You are Driven. </p>
<p>You can learn about the Rhyd team, and find informative articles about the Rideshare industry at <a href=""http://www.rhyd.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rhyd.co</a></p>

<h3>The Rhyd Platform can be a success with your support</h3>
<p>We can change this industry, but we can't do it alone. It will take the support of both riders and drivers that would like to see true change happen. Our goal at this stage in our campaign is to validate the market for future investors, finalize our patent, technical drawings, and documents of incorporation.  </p>
<h3>Our Goal!</h3>
<p>We are looking to only raise <strong>$3000</strong> to validate the market for future investors, cover our patent &amp; lawyer fees, technical drawings, and articles of incorporation. Any additional contributions will go to the further development of the Rhyd platform. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A Driver Focused Rideshare platform will revolutionize the industry for decades to come:</p>
<ul><li>Drivers can finally make a sustainable living while allowing riders an option to support a platform with a mission of corporate social  responsibility and social welfare</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>The Rhyd team has over 10 years of TNC, Commercial Transportation, Telematics, and Fleet management experience. We have seen the pitfalls of how other TNC's operate and know how to fix this industry so it's sustainable and fair for everyone, not just corporate interests.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Our model will be the stepping stones for future products and services that will increase drivers pay and vastly change riders experience. Rhyd is just at the beginning, but with your support, we will be rolling out services that have not been done yet in the rideshare industry.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There will be hurdles in our mission, but we know that if drivers and riders support our cause we can make a impact that will be a turning point in the Rideshare industry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dealing with heavily funded competition will be a challenge, but our belief is simple. Pay drivers a liveable and sustainable wage and watch their loyalty grow with Rhyd and away from the competition. </li>
<li>Rider adoption will be another factor. At Rhyd we know that it will be a challenge to get the word out, so our plan is to solely concentrate on drivers wellbeing and pay. If there are no drivers on the other platforms, riders will likely download the app with the most drivers and least wait-time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, which is perfectly fine. Here are other ways to help:</p>

Rider adoption will be another factor. At Rhyd we know that it will be a challenge to get the word out, so our plan is to solely concentrate on drivers wellbeing and pay. If there are no drivers on the other platforms, riders will likely download the app with the most drivers and least wait-time.


Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, which is perfectly fine. Here are other ways to help:

Share and join our Twitter & Facebook groups, please feel free to leave a written or video comment about how you feel the rideshare industry needs to change and why Rhyd is needed for that change

<p>Welcome to the official page of Marlin1 project. My name is Viktor Polyakov. I’m the author of Marlin1. As long as I remember, I’ve always been inventing and constructing something. Industrial design is my passion. I’ve always dreamed of creating something brand new in cycling which also could offer new options for outdoor family activities. It took me long to design a technologically and esthetically perfect vehicle from scratch, to design and adjust it. I'm not the first who try to promote such idea but my project is unique in its own way. The patent for Marlin1 hydrobike proves it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530716094/qedthckdzuuvzgynuqjw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We created Marlin1 hydrobike for all cycling lovers and those who can't imagine their life without exercise. Marlin1 is a pedal-powered bike designed for peddling on water with the rotational force transmitted to the propeller blade. Marlin1 is easy to handle, user-friendly and looks cool. The hydrobike is a small floating craft and an additional bike gadget. Marlin1 is primarily made for water cycling and other water activities.</p>
<p>Now the project is at the concept stage. We have designed a computer prototype of the hydrobike, including the models and 3D visualizations, worked on obtaining patent protection and on getting all papers ready for the launch of our product. The team is ready too. All is set to start the Marlin1 prototype production. <strong>All we need is to raise USD 38,000.</strong> I count on you! </p>

<p>Despite the fact that many authors tried to design similar vehicles before us we started from scratch and created a technologically and esthetically perfect vehicle. It took us a lot of time to adjust the idea, come up with the design and get in touch with potential producers of necessary component parts. <strong>In 2016 the hydro bike Marlin1 and its folding design were patented as a utility model primarily made for water cycling and other water activities. </strong>We worked hard on getting the project ready for launch making some adjustments in computer design sketches and model drafts.

<p>Marlin1 is a high-tech hydrobike made for water sports and active outdoor activities.</p>
<p><strong>Have you patented your invention?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, by all means. The project’s legal protection matters a lot to us. In 2016 the Marlin1 hydrobike and its folding design were patented as a utility model. The two-seater hydrobike brings a variety of water activities to all cycling lovers and can be used as an independent floating craft.</p>
<p><strong>Where is your production site located?</strong></p>
<p>The production site and other facilities related to our project are located in Kaunas, Lithuania.</p>
<p><strong>How would you define your vehicle?</strong></p>
<p>Basically the Marlin1 hydrobike is a latest high-tech product. This pedal-powered bike is designed for peddling on water with the rotational force transmitted to the propeller blade.</p>
<p><strong>How safe and compact is your vehicle during transportation?</strong></p>
<p>Marlin1 hydrobike is very user-friendly and safe. You can easily fold and transport it on top of your car. When folded the hydrobike is almost halved and can be easily attached to the car roof box.</p>
<p><strong>What materials do you intend to use in your hydrobike manufacturing?</strong></p>
<p>We’ll use only high-quality materials such as carbon fiber and aluminum.</p>
<p><strong>How many people can the Marlin1 hydrobike hold?</strong></p>

<p>Our initial goal was to organize production of the first three samples. Upon successful completion of tests, we plan to go into large-scale production of the hydrobikes.</p>
<p><strong>What is a planned in-store price for the hydrobike?</strong></p>
<p>Its retail price is planned to be USD 5,700.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to change the store price in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, certainly. The current premium model will consist of expensive materials and therefore costs USD 5,700. For 2-3 years of production, the team will work to create more affordable models and reduce the cost of the gadget.</p>

<p>The Beachman idea came to fruition in 2016 to stand for the best things in life - enjoying afternoons by the water, weekends on the road, and the glory days of 1960’s industrial design. We wanted to build incredible things that make those moments even better.</p>
<p>Our two founders Ben Taylor and Steve Payne encountered each other in 2019, and instantly connected. Ben, having the idea for an electric cafe racer &amp; Steve, the mechanic who could bring that dream to life, knew this was the perfect match.</p>
<p>A year later, Steve finished building our first prototype - a modified 1979 Kawasaki KZ200 dubbed “Bike Zero”. Using this as inspiration, we designed our first bike using standard motorcycle &amp; E-bike parts. Two weeks after we opened the first shipment, all 30 bikes of the Founders Edition E-Bike had been sold.</p>
<p>We've been working day and night to build Beachman into the company we’ve dreamed of. From road trips across Canada to get that perfect shot, to hand building our own retail store in the West End of Toronto. With the ‘64, we hope to build the greatest E-bike the world has ever seen. </p>
<p>There's much more to come from Beachman, from apparel and outdoors, to home, and to the beach. We're excited to embark on this journey and we're glad you're along for the ride.</p> <p>See you down the road.</p>

<p><strong>Ben Taylor - Co-Founder, CEO</strong></p>
<p>Ben grew up in the west end of Toronto, Ontario. After moving to Vancouver at 18 to attend Film School, he fell in love with the west coast and there fostered a love for design, adventure, and everything retro. While working in the film &amp; TV industry in Vancouver for some years, Ben created the Beachman Instagram page as a personal creative outlet and a mood board for his dream company. 6 years later, back in Toronto and teamed up with Steve, Ben is working to bring Beachman across North America and eventually to the world with the goal of reviving the best designs of the past with modern technology and materials.</p>
<p>Ben's next dream Beachman product? ""The Parachute is always at the top of the list. I want people to be able to walk into our store and walk out a little closer to James Bond.""</p>

<p><strong>Steve Payne - Co-Founder, COO, Head of Motorcycle Design</strong></p>
<p>Steve grew up in St. Johns, Newfoundland. In his teenage years while on a road trip out west, Steve joined up with some friends to do an epic motorcycle road trip from Vancouver to Sturgis and all the way to the East coast only a day after getting his Motorcycle license. From that day on a deep love of bikes was fostered, and Steve continued to work on bikes and get a formal education in motorcycle mechanics. After working as a professional sound engineer for the Film &amp; TV Industry for many years and building bikes and electric Volkswagens on the side, Steve has teamed up with Ben to bring his motorcycles to the world. </p>
<p>Steve's next dream Beachman product? ""An electric car concept that uses hub motors to power all 4 wheels and a modular design system like the Dune Buggy/Beetle of the '70s that could be a Baja dune blaster, dragster, or city runner.""</p>

No matter where you ride, the Beachman '64 is ready for any escape. Inspired by the classic 60s and 70s era in Malibu, the Beachman ‘64 E-bike is timeless.
 




Shipping costs based on destination / carrier, determined post-campaign.
 
The Tee
Simple, comfy, 70's style pocket tee featuring original artwork by French surf collage artist Yoann Fournier done for Beachman's summer collection. Featuring a 35mm film capture of an actual beachman at an actual beach, doing a whole lot of relaxing.


From Santa Monica to Monaco, you’ll find no e-bike like this.





Here's a look at each color option in its natural habitat.


Check out this video from the founders telling the story of the bike, how the company came to be, and what to expect from the Indiegogo campaign:
 



 

 

 
 

 
The Beachman idea came to fruition in 2016 to stand for the best things in life - enjoying afternoons by the water, weekends on the road, and the glory days of 1960’s industrial design. We wanted to build incredible things that make those moments even better.
Our two founders Ben Taylor and Steve Payne encountered each other in 2019, and instantly connected. Ben, having the idea for an electric cafe racer & Steve, the mechanic who could bring that dream to life, knew this was the perfect match.
A year later, Steve finished building our first prototype - a modified 1979 Kawasaki KZ200 dubbed “Bike Zero”. Using this as inspiration, we designed our first bike using standard motorcycle & E-bike parts. Two weeks after we opened the first shipment, all 30 bikes of the Founders Edition E-Bike had been sold.
We've been working day and night to build Beachman into the company we’ve dreamed of. From road trips across Canada to get that perfect shot, to hand building our own retail store in the West End of Toronto. With the ‘64, we hope to build the greatest E-bike the world has ever seen. 
There's much more to come from Beachman, from apparel and outdoors, to home, and to the beach. We're excited to embark on this journey and we're glad you're along for the ride. See you down the road.
 

The Beachman Retail Store at 2879 Dundas West in Toronto, Canada

Ben Taylor - Co-Founder, CEO
Ben grew up in the west end of Toronto, Ontario. After moving to Vancouver at 18 to attend Film School, he fell in love with the west coast and there fostered a love for design, adventure, and everything retro. While working in the film & TV industry in Vancouver for some years, Ben created the Beachman Instagram page as a personal creative outlet and a mood board for his dream company. 6 years later, back in Toronto and teamed up with Steve, Ben is working to bring Beachman across North America and eventually to the world with the goal of reviving the best designs of the past with modern technology and materials.
Ben's next dream Beachman product? ""The Parachute is always at the top of the list. I want people to be able to walk into our store and walk out a little closer to James Bond.""
 

Steve Payne - Co-Founder, COO, Head of Motorcycle Design
Steve grew up in St. Johns, Newfoundland. In his teenage years while on a road trip out west, Steve joined up with some friends to do an epic motorcycle road trip from Vancouver to Sturgis and all the way to the East coast only a day after getting his Motorcycle license. From that day on a deep love of bikes was fostered, and Steve continued to work on bikes and get a formal education in motorcycle mechanics. After working as a professional sound engineer for the Film & TV Industry for many years and building bikes and electric Volkswagens on the side, Steve has teamed up with Ben to bring his motorcycles to the world. 
Steve's next dream Beachman product? ""An electric car concept that uses hub motors to power all 4 wheels and a modular design system like the Dune Buggy/Beetle of the '70s that could be a Baja dune blaster, dragster, or city runner.""
 
Here's an inside look at our earliest drawings and 3D renders from 2018-2020

The original concept featured an inline mid-drive motor, as hub drives were still considered inferior 3 years ago when we began development. Things have changed dramatically since.
 

Other early designs featured a leather bag in the frame opening. This accessory will surely make a comeback down the road...

The BlackTea Moped combines vintage design with insane performance on-road or off-road, regardless. To have more fun you can take a friend and second battery with you.​

 
 


 

 
 

80 km/h top speed. 70 km range.
High performance hub motor. Maintenance free. 
Storage for two batteries. Easy removable.
Designed for two passengers. Street legal.  
Simple customisation. Manual for repairs. 
 

 
The clean and quiet characteristics of the bike offer new possibilities without disturbing the environment.  Go faster and farther than any bicycle and get to places motorcycles can't.
 

The BlackTea Moped is the most exciting vehicle to get around town & explore the outback. Avoid road congestions, park directly at your destination & discover new paths off the beaten track.   
 

Conquer new terrains with your electric adventure moped
 
Nothing can stop you if you want to explore new places. The BlackTea Moped can withstand rain, dirt, shallow rivers & off-road tracks. If there is no path, make your own.
 
 

 
Inspired by the open source idea of the IT industry we will develop a manual and a video series for the BlackTea Moped. This will allow everyone to repair their moped without an existing workshop network and design it to their own taste. 
 

 
We want to give our customers the necessary know-how so that they can take care of their BlackTea and do not have to rely on external help. Riding a motorcycle stands for independence, and we want it to stay that way. 
 
 
 

The BlackTea Moped is street legal in the US & EU. It is equipped with two mirrors, indicator lights, reflectors, fenders, license plate carrier, a horn & an LCD display.
 
 

 
*In Europe you only need a car or a moped license to operate it. In the US, the required license depends on your state’s regulation. Please check beforehand.
 

 
The BlackTea Moped is equipped with dual sports tires & two hydraulic disc brakes for optimal handling on streets & off-road. The halo LED lights look sexy & the alarm keeps thieves away.
 
 

 
You can take out the battery to charge it at any normal power outlet.  A second battery fits into the moped to double the range.

 
 

 


 

 

More and more local authorities are promoting the purchase of electric two-wheelers to reduce pollution in cities. Please check with your local authority if this applies to crowdfunded products. In case we can provide you with an invoice, so that you can enjoy additional savings.

While there are a lot of electric sit-down scooters in Europe, there is no appealing affordable motorcycle alternative. Disappointed about the state of the industry, Viktor started working on his own vision of a cool moped inspired by the vintage designs of the 70’s.
 

 


After building the first prototype, he realized that more people felt the same way & that an electric moped has the potential to inspire people to ride on two wheels. Viktor decided to put everything on one card. He paused his Master studies & set out to create a brand of creativity & adventure.
 


 


With the supporting network at the Technical University Munich and his mechanical engineering background, Viktor was able to move from an idea to a fully working prototype in under 6 months. The next step is clear, series production of the BlackTea Moped – with your help.
 
 

 
​
We are ready to take riding to the next level - We have a fully functional prototype that we have shown you here on Indiegogo. We have discussed and confirmed the remaining development steps until series production with our suppliers and partners. If all goes as planned, we will be able to complete production in schedule and ship the BlackTea Moped to you next spring.
 
 

Whatever happens on the way – we will keep you informed. Building a hardware product is hard and we may face unforeseen events that are going to delay us. But you can count on one thing: we will always keep you updated about our status.  
We are aware of the risks associated with this project. That is why the BT Moped is based on existing petrol motorcycles. This helps us keeping development time & costs down to ship the first products to you as soon as possible.
 
 

Kicking off a big production entails high set-up costs. As an independent startup company, we can only get it done with your help. Only if enough supporters back our project by pre-ordering, we will have enough funding to produce, assemble and ship. So – are you taking the ride with us? 
 
 

Help us by spreading our message into the world. Let’s show that electric mopeds can be damn sexy and fun-to-ride. Follow us on Social Media & share our story.",32.0,3,"1 Campaign

We have also treated a 7500 HP diesel engine with proof of principle testing verified by Azima DLI in 2015 which proved to increase cylinder compression and HORSE POWER while lowering overall system vibration, as well as engine head &amp; cylinder temperatures. We acquired the exclusive service license for this patented and patent pending nanomaterial from its American inventor and now we have the exclusive retail license. He discovered a process to create a new form of carbon in 2004, identified as the ONLY Spherical Nanodiamond. The goal of our company is to reverse environmental damage with a multidimensional approach that solves previously unsolvable issues that could not be addressed with current chemical lubrication or other technologies.

Add only after 7,000 or more miles are on the engine. The rings must first be seated to wear off the sharp edges on the rings, or pressure blow-by and loss of power will occur. Once the ring surface has flattened it is safe to add QuantumCoat™.  Contact the dealer for ring seating information.</p><p>What engine will show the most improvement?</p><p>High mileage engines gain the most with QuantumCoat™, such as auto engines with 150K or more miles and Semi Engines with 250,000 + miles. These high mileage engines also react the quickest and worn contact surface high spots coat quickly, resulting in rapid reduction of noise and vibration. Gas, diesel. propane and steam engines can all be treated.</p><p>What can I expect from this product?</p><p>Wherever you apply our product you get protection against wear, cooler, smoother, operating temperatures plus increase in fuel economy. The more places you protect, the higher the fuel economy rises because friction is lowered at the treated surface.</p><p>What are limits of QuantumCoat™ ?</p><p>It displays superior performance to oil and grease under low to extremely high pressures (3-4 million psi cannot break the particles), as well as in extremely low to extremely high temperatures.  It displays superior performance even after the oil or grease has burned away and is great on high temperature oven bearings such as automatic bread toasters used by all the major fast food chains.</p><p>How long should QuantumCoat™ be left in the Engine?</p><p>At least 3000 miles are when you normally change the oil, however oil analysis has proven its OK to change the oil filter, top off the oil and run it two times longer without changing the oil. Since wear metals will not be produced and the rings will be better sealed - carbon blow-by into oil is greatly reduced and the oil naturally stays cleaner. An Owner operator Ray Neal ran his own test after the treatment was fully worked in. He changed the oil to full synthetic and ran oil analysis at 20,000 miles (standard for OTR trucks) and the oil was OK. Again performed oil analysis at 40,000 and oil was OK, changed filter to be safe. Continued oil analysis every 5,000 and oil was OK. Stopped the test at 120,000 on that oil change because he got a little nervous, even though oil analysis showed the oil was still OK to use. On engines with heavy carbon deposits, this nanomaterial has been shown to creep under and loosen the deposits which puts the carbon into the oil turning it black, so change the filter and use the oil longer.</p><p>How much longer will an oil change last after QuantumCoat™ fully treats the Engine?</p><p>Normally new oil lasts 2 to 3 times longer because particulates no longer saturate the oil. It is normal for the oil to turn reddish brown with newly added oil, even at 10,000 and higher. Tribology testing (at Falex) of the oil at 10,000 miles (Castrol GTX that turned RED) from a treated Lincoln Continental proved the oil was as protective after 10K miles as it was when new, and it could have lasted another 10,000 miles or more - but that was good enough for the initial test performed in 2006.</p><p>Has QuantumCoat™ ever failed to work?</p><p>No, its a scientific principal that works every time the product is added, however adding a standard engine treatment to a semi, or extremely large engine will not produce optimum results. A special note to owners of 2012 vehicles and newer. An oil exec fully treated his 2015 Mustang GT (engine, trans, rear differential, water and power steering pump) and the efficiency gauge (computer) jumped to 30MPG while putting on 99% highway miles. After a couple weeks the efficiency display dropped back to the original 25MPG and he wanted to add more, but I said you don't need more. His testing finished when, on the highway (with a spare can of fuel in the trunk) his computer hit low fuel with 50 Miles to go. Noting the highway marker, he continued to drive exactly 50 miles, pulled over and the gauge read 25 miles to go. Never rely solely on the computer and they can reset themselves to factory presets.</p><p>What else can QuantumCoat™ be used on?</p><p>Any friction area such as Automatic or Manual transmissions, gear boxes, hydraulics, wheel bearings, Fifth wheel plates, any sliding contact surface (i.e. suspension components) etc.</p><p>Does QuantumCoat™ cause slipping in Automatic transmissions?</p><p>NO, This Nanotechnology works differently from chemical products and while under lower PSI conditions it reduces friction, under extreme loads it increases “stiction”. Exactly how it happens is somewhat of a secret, but tribological testing proved that is exactly what happens. Automatic transmissions tend to STOP slipping and shift faster.</p><p>Can QuantumCoat™ be added to airplanes or helicopters for preventive maintenance?</p><p>YES. The FAA informed us that our product was not restricted for use in aviation and the specifics are within the original FAQs at <a href=""http://www.diamondlube.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.diamondlube.com</a></p><p>Can QuatumCoat™ be applied to propellers to reduce or eliminate cavitation, or pitting?</p><p>YES. Rubbing the nanomaterial into the surface provides a quick and cost effective treatment. Friction drives the nanomaterial into the surface material, creating an extremely slippery surface so water or even air can easily slide over. This removes the conditions that cause cavitation.</p><p>Will QuantumCoat™ reduce Vibration?</p><p>YES. AzimaDLI, a world renowned Vibration Analysis Specialist tested the effects of QuantumCoat™ on vibration within a 7500 HP diesel engine, pump and gearbox. Vibration immediately decreased upon its addition to all treated areas of the system and continued to decrease over time.  While the original vibration did not return, areas not treated were still vibrating. The result was a 30 year old system that was more efficient and reliable than when it was new.</p><p>What happens when QuantumCoat™ is added to the high speed gearbox of a 400 megawatt windmill?</p><p>Many things happen, and they are all good for the environment and owner. The $2 Million gearboxes that normally last a couple years will last for 10 to 20 years or longer, saving $20 to $40 Million in replacement cost alone. Less service increases SAFETY and a smoother running windmill translates into higher power output. Heat is a known parasitic loss in any system, and the less power lost in the production of heat, the overall efficiency of any system increases.</p><p>Can anything else be treated on a windmill?</p><p>YES. All bearings from roller, ball and slip style will benefit. A 40KW windmill in Ireland had two worn four foot diameter shaft bearings that could be heard howling from 1500 feet away. Within minutes of treatment virtually all noise vanished and the bearings no longer required replacement.</p><p>Does QuantumCoat™ REBUILD worn out metal?</p><p>Nothing out of a bottle can do that. We are dealing with a nano particle thick coating that is extremely thin, however it is virtually impenetrable once applied. What happens is the CONDITIONS that resulted in wear, vibration, power loss, oil blow-by, and excessive heat are altered, and the treated friction surfaces then slide effortlessly past each other without the usual metal on metal contact. This condition causes the problems to appear to be reversed, but it is actually a lowering of friction and NOT reversal of wear which is ridiculous. Once applied, wear cannot occur as the friction surfaces are now both coated with Diamond Hard Carbon™. Once metal on metal contact is no longer possible, heat from that contact is severely reduced, noise and vibration are quieted, and overall efficiency is increased. Because there are now mated Diamond Hard Carbon™ surfaces, wear is not possible and the surfaces slide effortlessly. We are preparing a video that shows exactly how the effects of seeming wear reversal, increase compression and elimination of wear caused by cold starts occurs.</p><p>What is the secret ingredient in QuantumCoat™?</p><p>A newly created invention called Spherical Nanodiamond that measures .1-4nm and was first offered in 2006.</p><p>What is the carrier of the nanomaterial?</p><p>100% synthetic motor oil. The standard treatment uses 1/2 fl.oz. while the semi engine treatment has 1 fl.oz. The oil is simply a carrier of the novel, safe nanomaterial.</p><p>How do you manufacture this unique nanomaterial?</p><p>That’s a trade secret.</p><p>Thank you for considering being a contributor.</p><ul>

Never rely solely on the computer and they can reset themselves to factory presets.What else can QuantumCoat™ be used on?Any friction area such as Automatic or Manual transmissions, gear boxes, hydraulics, wheel bearings, Fifth wheel plates, any sliding contact surface (i.e. suspension components) etc.Does QuantumCoat™ cause slipping in Automatic transmissions?NO, This Nanotechnology works differently from chemical products and while under lower PSI conditions it reduces friction, under extreme loads it increases “stiction”. Exactly how it happens is somewhat of a secret, but tribological testing proved that is exactly what happens. Automatic transmissions tend to STOP slipping and shift faster.Can QuantumCoat™ be added to airplanes or helicopters for preventive maintenance?YES. The FAA informed us that our product was not restricted for use in aviation and the specifics are within the original FAQs at www.diamondlube.comCan QuatumCoat™ be applied to propellers to reduce or eliminate cavitation, or pitting?YES. Rubbing the nanomaterial into the surface provides a quick and cost effective treatment. Friction drives the nanomaterial into the surface material, creating an extremely slippery surface so water or even air can easily slide over. This removes the conditions that cause cavitation.Will QuantumCoat™ reduce Vibration?YES. AzimaDLI, a world renowned Vibration Analysis Specialist tested the effects of QuantumCoat™ on vibration within a 7500 HP diesel engine, pump and gearbox. Vibration immediately decreased upon its addition to all treated areas of the system and continued to decrease over time.  While the original vibration did not return, areas not treated were still vibrating. The result was a 30 year old system that was more efficient and reliable than when it was new.What happens when QuantumCoat™ is added to the high speed gearbox of a 400 megawatt windmill?Many things happen, and they are all good for the environment and owner. The $2 Million gearboxes that normally last a couple years will last for 10 to 20 years or longer, saving $20 to $40 Million in replacement cost alone. Less service increases SAFETY and a smoother running windmill translates into higher power output. Heat is a known parasitic loss in any system, and the less power lost in the production of heat, the overall efficiency of any system increases.Can anything else be treated on a windmill?YES. All bearings from roller, ball and slip style will benefit. A 40KW windmill in Ireland had two worn four foot diameter shaft bearings that could be heard howling from 1500 feet away. Within minutes of treatment virtually all noise vanished and the bearings no longer required replacement.Does QuantumCoat™ REBUILD worn out metal?Nothing out of a bottle can do that. We are dealing with a nano particle thick coating that is extremely thin, however it is virtually impenetrable once applied. What happens is the CONDITIONS that resulted in wear, vibration, power loss, oil blow-by, and excessive heat are altered, and the treated friction surfaces then slide effortlessly past each other without the usual metal on metal contact. This condition causes the problems to appear to be reversed, but it is actually a lowering of friction and NOT reversal of wear which is ridiculous. Once applied, wear cannot occur as the friction surfaces are now both coated with Diamond Hard Carbon™. Once metal on metal contact is no longer possible, heat from that contact is severely reduced, noise and vibration are quieted, and overall efficiency is increased. Because there are now mated Diamond Hard Carbon™ surfaces, wear is not possible and the surfaces slide effortlessly. We are preparing a video that shows exactly how the effects of seeming wear reversal, increase compression and elimination of wear caused by cold starts occurs.What is the secret ingredient in QuantumCoat™?A newly created invention called Spherical Nanodiamond that measures .1-4nm and was first offered in 2006.What is the carrier of the nanomaterial?100% synthetic motor oil. The standard treatment uses 1/2 fl.oz. while the semi engine treatment has 1 fl.oz. The oil is simply a carrier of the novel, safe nanomaterial.How do you manufacture this unique nanomaterial?That’s a trade secret.Thank you for considering being a contributor.

<p>The Iota uses two small wheels instead of one to better stabilize the rider without the use of leg supports and in order to stand alone. The patent-pending design includes a parallelogram-based turning assist mechanism which makes the Iota maneuverable and easy to use. In addition to an intelligent rider detection system, folding pedals, lights and a convenient carrying handle, the Iota will include Bluetooth capabilities with smartphone and watch apps coming soon. A suspension system is also in the works. </p>
<p>Our self-balancing technology is the best in the industry. We only use high-quality battery packs and motors as well as a full suite of electronic safety features giving the rider a gliding/flying free sort of feeling that enables you to move effortlessly and gracefully through the landscape. </p>
<p>Hoverboards and Segways are not good for transportation because of their wide footprint. You need to be constantly watching the path of the wheels on both sides of your feet. If you hit something you can make the vehicle spin, which could throw you off balance. The Iota eliminates these hazards.

Safety is key, so we’ve included two regenerative brakes, a stable deck and a heat-treated  ergonomic handle to keep you safer than being on a skateboard.
Our unique riding position lets you look behind to always be aware of hazards you could miss on electric scooters.
You'll be in full control of the board using the handle so you can react quickly to avoid any dangers.

 

We've made that awesome feeling of riding an electric skateboard safer and more stable, so you can hit every turn with confidence.

 

With 2 x 700W motors supplying a peak output of 3000W, the huge torque lets you sail up hills with ease.

 

The quick release handle folds flatter than most existing scooters to make storing your YAWBOARD a breeze.

 

When you can’t ride, the fold flat handle and lightweight construction lets you carry and transport easily making it the perfect companion for every journey.

At just 12kg it tips the scales much lighter than most scooters which average at 20kg.

 

With a deck constructed of bamboo and fiberglass, we found the perfect combination of strength and flexibility supplying suspension and improving feedback throughout every turn.
 With a 14AH battery, you can ride for longer without the worry of running out of juice.  With a battery status monitor for both the board and remote, the digital display also includes a speedometer and an odometer.Optional front and rear light kit mean you can go carve any time of the day. Compared to products with a similar spec, our discounted price is the clear winner at less than half the price of the closest vehicle.The YAWBOARD All-Terrain One-Deck is the easiest to learn, giving that awesome carving experience with minimum effort. This board has a removable handle so you can choose to use it as a 'scooter' or an electric skateboard! Available now with various payment options. For just a little extra, you can upgrade to the limited edition Stealth One-Deck board, black on black livery with all the added extras included to pimp your board and keep you safe.Our patent pending split-deck board is still in the final stages of development. At YAWBOARD, we're committed to keep our backers happy. We promise to offer 100% transparency on the manufacturing process and guarantee delivery of the product to your door. If you're an urban dweller, or a nature lover - this vehicle is for you. Whether you want to commute to work, hit the beach, cruise through the park, shred the hills or ride off-road, the YAWBOARD All-Terrain can satisfy your needs.Explore the World, conquer the hills, or cruise to work. The possibilities really are endless. Switch between the 3-speed modes at the touch of a button, perfect for every level of experience.  With the YAWBOARD All-Terrain One-Deck you'll get:YAWBOARD AT One-Deck x 1 / Skate Tool x 1 / Battery Charger x 1 (Correct for your country) / Remote control and charger x 1 / User Manual x 1 / Spare Belts x 2With the YAWBOARD All-Terrain Stealth you'll get:YAWBOARD AT Stealth One-Deck x 1 / Skate Tool x 1 / Battery Charger x 1 (Correct for your country) / Remote control and charger x 1 / User Manual x 1 / Spare Belts x 2 / Spare Remote x 1 / Front and Rear ShredLights / Helmet x 1 / Grip Tape Cleaner x 1 / Set of Cloudwheels and Belts / Bashguard x 1 Pitch, yaw and roll are the three dimensions of movement for a moving object. Yaw is when the nose moves from side to side, which represents the unique carving ride style that you find on a YAWBOARD.   The power of trial and improvement has featured heavily in the final design of the YAWBOARD-All-Terrain. We learnt an important lesson after every one of the 7 prototypes making improvements until we reached the perfect ride.  The money from the campaign will be put towards die-cast tooling and certification testing for standards and directives. These are an essential to be able to start on large scale production and to keep costs as low as possible for you.The remainder of the raise will go towards manufacture of the boards and for quality inspection before shipping. We need those boards to be on point for you when they arrive.  We don't want to charge you a penny more than we need to, and as shipping costs around the world are very high right now, we think it's only fair to calculate the shipping when we're closer to shipping to make sure you get the best deal. We're hoping this will be around $105-$135 (£80-£100) to your door. We have worked extremely hard to ready this product for Indiegogo, and full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but here are what we see as the risks and our plan to assess them:MANUFACTURING: The manufacturer is lined up, and we have quality assurance people on site during production.FULFILLMENT: Sometimes things get a bit crazy and stuff happens that can’t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a global pandemic, customs clearance or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. We are using an experienced logistics team to get our products to you. We’ll keep open and honest communication with you through our process so you know where your product is and when it’s going to get to you.",69.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Because an electric bike should be just that, a familiar pair of wheels that provides the power when it's needed but doesn't hinder you when it's not. We've kept the gears, the disk brakes and even a cheeky little bell. That's not to say we didn't make a few adjustments; how about a powerful motor and whopping battery for conquering those hills or arriving to work without breaking a sweat? </p>
<p>And all of this for... &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>Inspired by others, we too set out to deliver a stealthy electric bike. Having searched the globe, studied countless candidates, we’ve finally found it ... the PAPERBOY®. One of the sleekest and best concealed eBikes we’ve seen yet. What we wanted was the feel of a traditional hybrid road bike, infused with 21st-century tech. We too hid the bulky powerpack and the messy wires right inside the downtube. Then we went further, increasing the battery capacity by 50% and adding 21-speed gears. the PAPERBOY®’s a lightweight eBike that rides just like a traditional hybrid road bike. This is our interpretation of 21st-century active transport. Simple and sustainable. the PAPERBOY® is set for manufacture. Pledge for yours now. With your support and our know-how, the PAPERBOY® will deliver.</p>

<p>Production units of the PAPERBOY® are the subject of ongoing road tests. The alpha unit, 'Ada' reached 800km, without a significant issue, on 21st Nov '20 and reached 2,000km in early Jan '21.  The beta unit, 'Brian' had a controller failure shortly after assembly but nothing since. One of a number of solutions agreed with the manufacturer, arising from frailties uncovered during the road tests, is relocation of the controller to the seat tube.</p>
<p>The ‘2,000km Teardown’ is the name we’ve given to the feature-length interview we’ve transcribed about the 2,000km road test of the PAPERBOY® which we conducted in the British winter of 2020-21.</p>
<p>In the interview we,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>explain</strong> what caused a veteran video game company to decide to offer an eBike</li>
<li>
<strong>describe</strong> how the PAPERBOY® was selected</li>
<li>
<strong>introduce</strong> you to Dave Neale, an eBike designer and builder and co-creator of the PAPERBOY®</li>
<li>
<strong>discuss</strong> what we learned about the PAPERBOY® during the 2,000km road test</li>
<li>
<strong>reveal</strong> how what we learned is being used by the manufacturer to improve the eBike, that’s already in production, to ensure that the PAPERBOY® delivers</li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently and uniquely, the manufacturer of the PAPERBOY® has enabled two key components, the display / meter and the controller, to be treated as user-serviceable parts (just like a worn-tyre). In so doing the manufacturer has, we believe, minimised the costs and mitigated the need for the PAPERBOY® to spend days, weeks or longer in the hands of an eBike engineer who would otherwise be required to repair or replace these notoriously frail components of all eBikes.</p>
<p>Note 1: In early Mar ’21 a preview of the “2,000km Teardown” was record by one of the PAPERBOY®’s creators. In the preview it’s claimed that <i>“the ""2,000km Teardown"" is the name we’ve given to the short film we’re creating about the 2,000km road test and that the “2,000km Teardown” will be published on the day the Indiegogo campaign for the PAPERBOY® goes live”.</i> Whilst Covid-19 restrictions mean that’s not yet been possible, for completeness the preview is available to view <a href=""https://youtu.be/EnJrT3V-uI0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>You might ask, ""What Experience Do You Have In Running A Crowd Funding Campaign?""</strong></p>
<p>In 2013/4 Elite EV’s sister company ran a crowd funding campaign to pay for the tooling for and production of 1,000 units of a system known as the Recreated ZX Spectrum; a 21st century recreation of a popular 1980s’ home computer. The campaign was successful and 10,000 units of the Recreated ZX Spectrum were manufactured. Today they typically resell on auction sites at a premium to their original £49.99 SRP.</p>
<p><strong>You might also ask, ""What Did You Learn From Your Previous Crowd Funding Campaign?""</strong></p>
<p>We learned that however careful you are in choosing your manufacturing partner, unforeseeable issues and unexpected consequences can arise. In the case of the Recreated ZX Spectrum, we’ve documented those issues and consequences and how we successfully addressed them. (A copy of the document is available by request to: paperboy@elite-systsems.co.uk) We’re applying what we learned to the production of the PAPERBOY® by using a variety of techniques, including scheduling delivery.</p>

<p>If justified by demand (which we won't be able to guage until after this campaign is launched), we'll make the PAPERBOY® available for test rides - whist this campaign is running - by bringing 'Ada' (and or 'Brian') to railway stations around the United Kingdom.

<p>the PAPERBOY® is already being manufactured.  Nonetheless, manufacturers and their suppliers change their products and components from time to time. So, there may be some modest differences between the version of the PAPERBOY® described in the Technical Overview and the final product(s). The nature and position of the decals on the frame of the PAPERBOY® is for illustration and may vary. Also, demand for the premium components used in the PAPERBOY® is at an all time high. Shortages of these components and other issues could adversely affect production schedules and therefore deliveries.</p>

We've kept the gears, the disk brakes and even a cheeky little bell. That's not to say we didn't make a few adjustments; how about a powerful motor and whopping battery for conquering those hills or arriving to work without breaking a sweat? 
And all of this for... >>>>>>
That's us, that's the PaperBoy, simply uncompromising. 
 
 
 
 
  

 
 


 


 
Inspired by others, we too set out to deliver a stealthy electric bike. Having searched the globe, studied countless candidates, we’ve finally found it ... the PAPERBOY®. One of the sleekest and best concealed eBikes we’ve seen yet. What we wanted was the feel of a traditional hybrid road bike, infused with 21st-century tech. We too hid the bulky powerpack and the messy wires right inside the downtube. Then we went further, increasing the battery capacity by 50% and adding 21-speed gears. the PAPERBOY®’s a lightweight eBike that rides just like a traditional hybrid road bike. This is our interpretation of 21st-century active transport. Simple and sustainable. the PAPERBOY® is set for manufacture. Pledge for yours now. With your support and our know-how, the PAPERBOY® will deliver.
 

 


 


 

In US factory-specification the PAPERBOY® has 500W max, power output, a 20mph top speed and is Class 1 eBike compliant. In UK factory-specification the PAPERBOY® has 250W max. power output, a 25kph top speed and is EAPC compliant. See ""Outline Technical Specification"" at the foot of this listing further details.
the PAPERBOY®'s versatile KT LCD3 display/meter offers 5 modes of assistance plus""Cruise Control"" and 6kph ""Walk / Push Power Assistance"". the PAPERBOY® is stealthy by design. The bulky power-pack's hidden in the down-tube, so no one can see it's powered.**: In UK spec. get 50+ miles / 80+ km of assistance from a single charge in mode 3. (Assisted range is dependent upon factors including rider weight, gradient / elevation, temperature and riding style.)the PAPERBOY®'s 21-speed gears ensure that, even when the battery's depleted, you can continue to ride all day, whatever the gradient / elevation - something eBikes with just one or only a few gears simply don't enable a typical rider to do.  

 
Production units of the PAPERBOY® are the subject of ongoing road tests. The alpha unit, 'Ada' reached 800km, without a significant issue, on 21st Nov '20 and reached 2,000km in early Jan '21.  The beta unit, 'Brian' had a controller failure shortly after assembly but nothing since. One of a number of solutions agreed with the manufacturer, arising from frailties uncovered during the road tests, is relocation of the controller to the seat tube.
The ‘2,000km Teardown’ is the name we’ve given to the feature-length interview we’ve transcribed about the 2,000km road test of the PAPERBOY® which we conducted in the British winter of 2020-21.
In the interview we,


explain what caused a veteran video game company to decide to offer an eBike

describe how the PAPERBOY® was selected

introduce you to Dave Neale, an eBike designer and builder and co-creator of the PAPERBOY®

discuss what we learned about the PAPERBOY® during the 2,000km road test

reveal how what we learned is being used by the manufacturer to improve the eBike, that’s already in production, to ensure that the PAPERBOY® delivers

The “2,000km Teardown” interview can be read (and downloaded) by clicking on the image below.

Consequently and uniquely, the manufacturer of the PAPERBOY® has enabled two key components, the display / meter and the controller, to be treated as user-serviceable parts (just like a worn-tyre). In so doing the manufacturer has, we believe, minimised the costs and mitigated the need for the PAPERBOY® to spend days, weeks or longer in the hands of an eBike engineer who would otherwise be required to repair or replace these notoriously frail components of all eBikes.
Note 1: In early Mar ’21 a preview of the “2,000km Teardown” was record by one of the PAPERBOY®’s creators. In the preview it’s claimed that “the ""2,000km Teardown"" is the name we’ve given to the short film we’re creating about the 2,000km road test and that the “2,000km Teardown” will be published on the day the Indiegogo campaign for the PAPERBOY® goes live”. Whilst Covid-19 restrictions mean that’s not yet been possible, for completeness the preview is available to view here.

The alpha unit, 'Ada' reached 800km, without a significant issue, on 21st Nov '20 and reached 2,000km in early Jan '21.
You might ask, ""What Experience Do You Have In Running A Crowd Funding Campaign?""
In 2013/4 Elite EV’s sister company ran a crowd funding campaign to pay for the tooling for and production of 1,000 units of a system known as the Recreated ZX Spectrum; a 21st century recreation of a popular 1980s’ home computer. The campaign was successful and 10,000 units of the Recreated ZX Spectrum were manufactured. Today they typically resell on auction sites at a premium to their original £49.99 SRP.
You might also ask, ""What Did You Learn From Your Previous Crowd Funding Campaign?""
We learned that however careful you are in choosing your manufacturing partner, unforeseeable issues and unexpected consequences can arise. In the case of the Recreated ZX Spectrum, we’ve documented those issues and consequences and how we successfully addressed them. (A copy of the document is available by request to: paperboy@elite-systsems.co.uk) We’re applying what we learned to the production of the PAPERBOY® by using a variety of techniques, including scheduling delivery.
 

 

If justified by demand (which we won't be able to guage until after this campaign is launched), we'll make the PAPERBOY® available for test rides - whist this campaign is running - by bringing 'Ada' (and or 'Brian') to railway stations around the United Kingdom. Look out for an announcement of the ""Station To Station - Tour"".
 


 
The service we offer to you is important to us. the PAPERBOY® is our interpretation of 21st century active transport, simple and sustainable. Our commitment to service and sustainability requires we that we are local and that, in the unlikely event of you wishing to return the PAPERBOY® for repair or another reason, you can do so in the UK (where we are located) or the US (where our activities are lead by the former head of our North American video games publishing unit). 
 
 


Getting the PAPERBOY® / Saving An ADDITIONAL £500

the PAPERBOY® Delivers, However You Get It: As it’s available in the UK / US exclusively from Elite EV there are no intermediaries to pay and so the PAPERBOY®’s arguably the best value stealthy lightweight hybrid eBike currently on offer.
Better, if you have the good fortune to be eligible for a £500 Travel Better voucher (you can read more about that here) then you can order one of the perks and you may get upto an ADDITIONAL £500 discount. If so, you may need to deliver your £500 Travel Better voucher to us before your perk is despatched. 
Bettter yet, on 25th Jan '21 the UK's Department of Transport confirmed to us ""“We will establish a national eBike support programme, which could include loans, subsidies, or other financial incentives, using the learning from other schemes in the UK and abroad for eBikes, adapted eBikes and other eVehicles”. The eBike support programme is still being developed and decisions have yet to be made on options detailed above. Further details will be announced in due course.""  You can read more about that here. So, in the event the £500 Travel Better voucher programme, or a comparable voucher programme, is extended across the UK and if you are eligible, then you too can order one of the perks and you may get upto an ADDITIONAL £500 discount. If so, you may need to deliver your UK national eBike support programme voucher to us before your perk is despatched.
In the event of comparable schemes being launched in the USA we'll reference them here.
Production capacity is limited. Order the PAPERBOY® here, now to get priority delivery.
Note 2: if there's sufficient demand, we'll add a perk or perks which include 2 or more units of the PAPERBOY®. If you'd like us to do this then do please let us know by sending an email to paperboy@elite-systems.co.uk 
 
 

 
The people who, in 1986, published the home computer versions of Paperboy®, a coin-op from American arcade game legends Atari® Games. The home computer versions of Paperboy® topped the UK game charts for a then record breaking 3 months. Tap on ""Elite EV"" above to read our full profile.

 
 

 
the PAPERBOY® is already being manufactured.  Nonetheless, manufacturers and their suppliers change their products and components from time to time. So, there may be some modest differences between the version of the PAPERBOY® described in the Technical Overview and the final product(s). The nature and position of the decals on the frame of the PAPERBOY® is for illustration and may vary. Also, demand for the premium components used in the PAPERBOY® is at an all time high. Shortages of these components and other issues could adversely affect production schedules and therefore deliveries.
 
 

 

A 2019 study published in the journal Injury Prevention found that crashes involving the power-assisted, potentially higher-speed cycles (eBikes) were more likely to result in hospitalization and internal injuries for riders compared to traditional bikes. It goes without saying that we want you to enjoy the PAPERBOY® safely. The UK government has published Cycle Safety information, with helpful tips and advice for cyclists and drivers. Consequently, we urge every reader, whether they back the campaign or not to devote 60 seconds of their time to this helpful read.

Whether we are riding to work, the shops or getting out exploring at the weekend, there is no doubt that getting out on two wheels keeps our bodies and minds in shape. And that cycling is a fantastic eco-friendly mode of transport.But it can be really hard to quickly find a good, safe route and a simple way of following it.  Existing solutions can be distracting, expensive and fragile.We changed that when we released our Velo in 2017. And now, with years of feedback from tens of thousands of riders, we are very excited to bring you our updated Velo 2.It combines everything that riders have loved about the Velo with a totally revamped design and an all-new interface that makes road rating (feeding back on your route to help us make your future rides - and those of other riders - better) even easier.    And will incorporate all of the following features:      What if you could follow routes that were selected by cyclists like you for cyclists like you? What if someone could tell you the quick ways, the quiet ways and the in-between ways? Where feels safe, and where feels scary?Velo 2 is here to do just that.Via its companion app (iOS and Android), Velo 2 offers its own Beeline Smart Routing* which blends all of the best available mapping and road use data with insights from cyclists who have ridden the road before. All you need to do is type your destination, and you’ll be offered up to three routes to get there.A fast route will get you there as quickly as possible, a quiet route will prioritise roads that feel the safest, and a balanced route will blend the two. All of them will show you which parts of the route have been well rated by other riders, and which have been poorly rated; so you know when you can relax and enjoy the ride and prepare for any trickier sections.It’s pretty simple, really. Anyone using Beeline can say at any point of their journey whether they’re having a positive or negative experience. We call them Beeline Road Ratings.On the Velo 2, we make road rating even easier.Just give your Velo 2 a press on the plus button if you like a road, and a press on the minus button if you don't. We’ve put little markers on the device so that it’s nice and simple!After you have given your feedback, it feeds directly into our routing algorithm to adapt and improve your future routes, and those of other cyclists in your area. Win-win.Combining real user data with road data, our routing is much better optimised for a good safe bike ride. You can see how we compare to well-known routing providers below:   Sometimes we want to follow a very specific route, sometimes we want to throw caution to the wind and have a bit of an adventure! That’s why we have a routing option for every occasion.Choose turn-by-turn with Beeline Smart Routing for when you want to follow a fantastic route from A to B.  Choose our original Compass Mode for as-the-crow-flies navigation; an arrow will point at your final destination and allow you to pick your own path to it.  Or, if you have found a super route elsewhere, import a GPX into the Beeline app to be guided along it by your Velo 2.   Once you have a well planned route, being able to follow it is the next challenge!Sometimes just navigating a navigation device makes you want to toss it into the nearest hedge. And how are you supposed to read and ride at the same time anyway?!We know that a big part of feeling safe in the saddle is being able to keep your attention on the road in front of you. That’s why we have developed and tested an exceptionally simple navigation interface; so that all the information you need is just a glance away.Want to check that you’re on track to arrive where you need to be on time? You can tap across to check your speed, time and how much of the route you have covered so far.  Knowing where to turn next is just part of the experience. Velo 2 will also have a speedo, odometer, clock and ETA so that you can keep track of your progress as you ride.     At Beeline, we don’t believe that it matters how far you went, or how fast you rode. But it’s still pretty cool to know, isn’t it? That’s why we allow you to keep a record of everywhere you have been and how far you’ve ridden.  We know that everybody’s different and that no two rides are the same...even for the same person!  That’s why we have made a product that will be as useful zipping around cities as it will be exploring the countryside. It also works worldwide* out of the box - no need to buy any additional maps!  Our bicycles are often our trusted companions for years, if not decades, and we believe that the Velo 2 should be no different. That’s why we have designed, and manufactured, Velo 2 to withstand the elements with you. It will be shock and water-resistant - we’re targeting a high rating to ensure you can ride with confidence in the worst of weather conditions.   We get it. Having to keep track of what you need to charge is annoying! That’s why Velo 2’s battery offers up to 10 hours of daytime use, 20 hours of night-time use and up to six months on standby. Velo 2 pairs with your smartphone to work. And drastically reduces the battery drain of navigation on your phone in the process! You can see how running Beeline navigation with Velo 2 compared against running navigation on Strava below:    Beeline Velo 2 is a smart device, connected to your phone and to the cloud. This means it can keep getting better through software updates and we’re committed to doing just that. Since we launched our first product back in 2017, we’ve released 10 major feature updates based on the feedback we’ve heard from our community. And we’re only just getting started!   Every Velo 2 device comes with a twist-lock mount (with bands to fit standard handlebars) and a USB-C charging cable.   Velo 2 will integrate the best of recent technology to bring new features and an all new design. Here's a full tech spec and how it compares to our original Velo device:  And here's how it compares against our competitors:    We have thousands of Beeliners who have joined the journey over the last few years. Here's what some of them have to say about their Velos and our app:   ""LOVE IT!Excellent device!

 Whichever mode you are using, braking will freeze your backlights and increase their intensity as you brake.This feature is made possible with a built-in accelerometer in the Raylier jacket along with our proprietary algorithms. 
 
 
 We have made an optional connectivity module that connects your bike to your Raylier jacket. Compatible with 100% of motorbikes. Just connect it to the blinker cable of your bike. Don't worry, no tools are needed, we made it plug and play! >> Please ADD $45 to your pledge if you want the connectivity module <<  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 We're thinking of a fall detection feature. Let us know if that's something you'd like to see as a future update on your Raylier jacket and we'll consider adding it as a stretch goal. 
 
 Our mission has always been to solve the safety issues when riding a motorbike. While adding features that will become the standard of tomorrow, we made sure to design a jacket with today's highest safety regulations. We are proud to say all RAYLIER jackets have passed class AA certification. It is the toughest range of tests we could make our jackets go through. The outer shell is one strong armor you will feel comfortable in. Each jacket is equipped with level 2 visco-elastic protection shells. Recognized as the higher safety standard, they offer optimal protection while providing extreme comfort. The back shell is optional, you'll be able to add it to your order at the end of the campaign in the survey (+$40). 
 
 
 At Raylier quality and comfort are some of our top priorities.             All our jackets include an extended back panel that helps to protect you from the wind coming in at your back.  We use only anti-abrasive, tear-resistant fabrics.  All the jackets include high-quality YKK zippers and branded buttons and snaps that are custom made, helping to ensure that your jacket will last for a lifetime. We also made sure the lighting system is non-intrusive, so you will never feel that you are wearing it.         The most important feature, however, is the comfort of knowing that you are being seen on the road.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You'll choose your gender and size after the campaign ends.Each jacket comes in Men/Women edition. As for the sizes, men come in XS to 5XL while women jackets are available in XS to 2XL.  
 For the sizing chart and how to measure guide, please refer to the surveys that we'll send out by January 2021. 
 
 
  We launched our first generation of RAYLIER leather jacket 2 years ago and since then, shipped thousands of units worldwide. We gathered hundreds of feedback to design the safest jacket you've been dreaming of.

<h3>What is the Electrom LEV?</h3>
<p>The Electrom is a completely emissions free Light Electric Vehicle that legally qualifies as an e-bike in most parts of the world.  It uses a fraction of the energy used by a car to transport a single person and because it is legally a bicycle, it has real advantages when it comes to getting through congested traffic.</p>
<p>At just 60 cm / 24 inches wide the Electrom can easily slip through stalled traffic like a bicycle, and you can park it anywhere you can park a bicycle. Wherever you are going, the Electrom will get you there free of pollution and faster.</p>

<h2>How We Will Bring the Electrom 1 LEV to Market</h2>
<p>Our crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo will raise the money to create a Production Sample and then Beta Test models. After a reasonable testing period, assembly line production will begin. We don't need a lot of money to get this done; the Electrom has been developed carefully and under budget to this point and we aim to keep it that way. All of the funds raised will go directly to the creation the Electrom 1 Production Sample.</p>
<p><strong>Wait list plan</strong><br/>We value transparency, and want to make sure that we set realistic delivery dates and goals. As such, we are not taking big deposits or trying to pre-sell a bunch of Electroms. Instead we are offering wait-list positions with prices based on how soon you want your Electrom. You can get on the wait-list for as little $25, and  if you really believe in the project you could pledge $1000 to be one of the five Beta Testers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526364672/uaakdlwgfxeaujqp8lsj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>No mystery parts or cheap gimmicks</strong><br/>The Electrom is designed around popular and proven pre-existing parts. This will help get them made quickly and offer end users lots of choice in sourcing replacement parts. We have established relationships with some of the best e-bike and bicycle parts providers out there. All of the components used will be top-of-the-line  and selected for performance and reliability. The first generation of Electrom 1s will be produced on a small scale and sold in easily assembled  kit format. The delivery as a kit will help with shipping costs  and offers flexibility to suit local e-bike laws . Once we have a proven market we will take the next step to true mass-production.</p>
<p><strong>A question of timing</strong><br/>Many efforts have been made in the past to bring a single-passenger electric vehicle to market, and most of them failed. Some failed because they were bad ideas, but many failed because neither society nor the technology was ready. We believe that modern population, time,  and environmental pressures have brought us to the point where people are eager to give up their cars in exchange for a vehicle like the Electrom. This combined with the fact that electric vehicle battery and component technology has taken giant steps forward in the last decade leads us to believe that the world is finally ready for LEV's.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptable to e-bike laws in almost any area</strong><br/>There are a variety of rules for e-bikes for different countries. The Electrom is built on a modular platform that will be able to run a variety of electric drive systems to suit local laws. Whether you need a direct drive hub motor, geared hub motor, or mid-drive system, all are possible with the Electrom. It can qualify as a moped in many countries. The moped designation allows for more power  and a higher top speed than a regular e-bike.</p>
<p><strong>Made in North America</strong><br/>A number of well-meaning crowdfunded e-bikes have had delays and other challenges when it comes to getting bikes built in Asia. We have taken steps to avoid this phenomenon by designing a vehicle that is less complicated and uses as many off-the-shelf components as possible. The early Electrom 1s will be built locally to get them to the backers as quickly as possible. Once the Electrom 1 has proven itself, we will work to optimize production on a larger scale.</p>
<p><strong>Hit the ground running</strong><br/>Our first milestone will be building the Electrom 1 Production Sample; this work will start as soon as the campaign is funded. After the Production Sample is complete and some testing has taken place we will invite our Beta Test Backers to review the bike as built.  They will then have the option to exercise their wait-list position. The five Beta Test bikes will be built in Victoria BC and delivered quickly, with the first in buyers' hands as early as December 2018.<br/> </p>
<h2>Differences Between the Prototype and the Production Model</h2>
<p>We are very happy with the basic design and geometry of the Electrom Prototype but the desire to make it legal in as many areas as possible, combined knowledge gained over two years and 4500+ kilometers of testing has resulted in a few changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>20"" bicycle / 16"" moped wheels </strong>- Some areas define a bicycle as having a minimum wheel size of 20"" outer diameter. To meet this requirement we have outfitted the Electrom 1 with heavy duty 20"" bike wheels. This is the same tire size as the 16"" moped standard, so users will have access to a wide variety of tires styles and tread patterns. This wheel size will also offer a smoother ride on rough roads.</li>
<li>
<strong>Different rear hatch design</strong> - two years of testing have shown that a different style of rear cargo hatch is required. The Electrom 1 hatch will still be removable to carry a passenger, but it will hinge at the back instead of the top.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lighter weight </strong>- The Electrom 1 will make use of lightweight components where necessary to achieve a balance between efficiency and durability. The final vehicle weight is expected to be 120 lbs.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592006699/vkuvckwczfcey7kbj3me.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Electrom 1 Specifications:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Welded aluminum Frame.</li>
<li>203 cm / 80 inch wheel base.</li>
<li>55 kilo / 120 lbs weight without batteries.</li>
<li>100 mm/ 4 inches of front and rear suspension travel.</li>
<li>20"" diameter wheels.</li>
<li>Fiberglas and carbon fiber body panels and tailbox.</li>
<li>72 volt battery system (user configurable). Base battery is 72 volt, 20 amp-hour Lithoum pack. Approximately $750 USD landed.</li>
<li>Up to 300km/186 mile range.</li>
<li>Regenerative braking and hydraulic disk brakes</li>

<li><p>Able to accommodate rider sizes ranging from 1 meter 52cm / 5' 0""  to  2 meter /  6' 10"".</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>How Much Will the Electrom 1 Cost? </h2>
<p>It is difficult to give an exact estimate until we have completed the production sample, but we estimate that the Frame kit will sell for $2500 USD, the Base Kit will sell for as low as $4,000 USD, and the Deluxe Kit with full tailbox and front fairing will be around $6000 USD. All of the above options are sold without battery. This will allow the end-user to select a battery that suits their individual needs. As one of the big costs of a battery is the Hazardous Materials Shipping Charge, it doesn't make sense to ship a battery to the Electrom  assembly plant and then on to the final destination. We will provide a list of known reputable local battery suppliers to Electrom purchasers, and should there be no local supply of batteries we will be able to provide a battery at cost.</p>

<h2>Some Details of the Electrom 1 LEV</h2>
<p><strong>Range and Power</strong> - The Electrom was designed to be configurable to e-bike rules in as many countries as possible. In its stock configuration it  uses an electric hub motor that easily produces enough power to travel as fast as 60 kph / 40 mph. Using one 72 volt, 20 amp-hour battery and traveling at 32 KPH / 20 mph it has a range of 100 +  kilometers / 62 miles. The frame has room for three such batteries yielding a potential range of 300+ Kilometers / 186 miles.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525210620/fuoniymlypfgpzfiv0rj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Immune to Traffic Jams </strong>- The Electrom is legally a bicycle, and is allowed to lane-split, use bike lanes and the medians on the side of highways.  This and the Electrom’s very narrow profile–less than 60 cm / 24 inches–allows the rider to easily slip through stalled traffic.</p>

<p><strong>No complicated gearshifting needed and all the exercise you want - </strong>The Generator Drive acts like an automatic transmission for a bike.  At speeds under 10 kilometers / 6 miles-per-hour the rider's effort goes to the back wheel via chain drive and helps the Electrom get up to speed. This is also helpful when they encounter a steep hill because  the rider's pedaling helps the electric motor get the vehicle up the hill. At speeds above 10 kilometers / 6 miles per-hour, riders can pedal at a constant speed and their efforts are converted to electricity to supplement the battery. If the operator wants a hard workout, they need only pedal a little faster and the resistance increases.  If they wish to take it easy, they can pedal slower and the resistance decreases. The system is automatic and no levers or buttons are required to switch between modes. Although this may sound complicated, the Generator Drive is mechanically simple, with only 7 moving parts, and does not rely on electronic control so there's very little to go wrong.</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""360"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/274883584"" width=""640""></iframe></div><p></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Configurable</strong>- The Electrom’s controller is easily programmable for different jurisdictions. For example, in the state of California the top speed for a Class B electric bike is  30 mph / 42 KPH and 750 watts of power draw–with a few minutes of programing the controller can be set for these parameter.  It also has an unlimited setting for track or off-road use. Depending on your local laws you may wish to configure your Electrom to use a Direct Drive Hub Motor, Geared Hub Motor or Mid-Drive System, at time of order, you will be able to specify your desired configuration (the Generator Drive will not be available on a Mid-Drive).</p>

<p><strong>Real Exercise</strong> - Many electric bikes are really just electric scooters with pedals attached to exploit e-bike standards as a loophole.

</div><p>A special thanks to our model, Erin McGuigan is in order. </p></div>","What is the Electrom LEV?
The Electrom is a completely emissions free Light Electric Vehicle that legally qualifies as an e-bike in most parts of the world.  It uses a fraction of the energy used by a car to transport a single person and because it is legally a bicycle, it has real advantages when it comes to getting through congested traffic.
At just 60 cm / 24 inches wide the Electrom can easily slip through stalled traffic like a bicycle, and you can park it anywhere you can park a bicycle. Wherever you are going, the Electrom will get you there free of pollution and faster.








Immune to Traffic Jams - Because it is legally a bicycle, the Electrom is allowed to use bike lanes, the median on the side of highways and to lane-split in stuck traffic.




No time wasted looking for parking - As a bicycle the the Electrom can be parked right where you want to go on the sidewalk, and the narrow profile means pedestrians can easily get past.




Cargo & Passengers - The Electrom can carry 100 liters /22 gallons of cargo in a waterproof lockable trunk.  With the easy removal of the cargo hatch it can carry a passenger (passenger size varies depending on the confidence and size of the driver).




Extremely Cost Effective - The Electrom requires no insurance or fuel. At the average US electricity cost of about 12 cents per kilowatt-hour, it costs about 18  cents to charge the battery. That works out to .225 cents per kilometer /.36 cents per mile. Conversely; The American Automobile Association puts the cost of owning and operating a new vehicle in 2017  at an average of $8,469 annually. 




Safety - The Electrom comes equipt with high-visibility LED lights and turn signals,  as well as side mirrors that offer a full view of the road behind. The vehicle itself is highly visible to drivers and they tend to give Electrom riders more room in passing than they would to a conventional bicycle




Exercise -  At the heart of the Electrom is the Generator Drive, which makes pedaling your bike easier (there are no gears to think about), and offers better exercise. There is still a direct connection between the pedals and the wheel which allows the rider to help propel the Electrom up steep hills and to meet the legal definition of a bicycle.




Built to Last - The Electrom is designed to last with an aluminum frame and molded fiberglass and carbon fiber body parts. It has very few moving parts and uses mostly off-the-shelf bicycle components available in any bike shop This guarantees that replacement parts will never be hard to find.




Proven - The current Electrom Prototype has been on the road for over two years, and in that time it has logged over 4500 kilometers / 2800 miles  of travel in a variety of conditions. The design has more than verified it's reliability, safety and comfort. 


 

The Electrom is an emissions-free vehicle packed with features that will allow you to get where you are going with style and convenience, while providing as much or as little exercise as you desire. It looks different because it is different. For the better. 

Electrom 1 Highlights:
Vehicle Features

72 volt electric assist system with regenerative braking. Top speed of 60kph, adjustable to suit local laws.
100 kilometer / 62 mile base range, 300 kilometers / 186 mile  with extra battery packs.
Over 100 liters / 22 gallons of secure waterproof cargo space.
The removable cargo hatch allows for passengers.
Full set of headlights, turn signals, brake lights and horn.
Electronic security features and keyswitch. 
USB charge port and  cell phone mount built in.
A narrow profile allows the Electrom to go anywhere and park anywhere a bicycle can park.
The Electrom is designed to be comfortably ridden in wet weather. The front fairing completely protects your legs and feet so no special footwear or rain pants are needed.
The Electrom is designed around a recumbent riding position that is extremely comfortable, especially on longer trips. The design also puts the majority of the vehicle's weight close to the ground which makes for a superior center of gravity and handling compared to an upright e-bike.
A low step-over height of only 17 inches makes getting on and off of the Electrom a snap.
The tilt away front fairing allows for easy entrance and egress, and is made of a pliable plastic that will crumple in the event of a head-on collision
The Generator Drive acts like an automatic transmission and removes the need to shift  through a complicated set of bicycle gears while allowing the rider to exercise as much or as little as they want.
All aspects of the vehicle chain-drive system are enclosed inside the body so there's no worry about chain grease on clothing.
The quick-deploy center stand allows for easy parking and resting at stop lights
The Electrom will be available with a number of drive options to suit local laws

 
Environmental and Health Benefits

A true zero emission vehicle, the Electrom is 100% human and electric powered.
The Electrom uses very little energy - the power from a 500 Watt solar panel can charge the Electrom in three hours.

Financial and Legal Advantages

Legally a bicycle, so busts through traffic jams.
As an e-bike the Electrom requires no registration, license or insurance.
Very few moving parts = very low maintenance cost and less down time.
As a bicycle it can park almost anywhere. Never look for a parking spot again
The Electrom Qualifies for priority loading on BC ferry and Washington State Ferries, passage costs only $1.00 in Washington on Washington State Ferries and as little as $2.00 on BC Ferries


 
How We Will Bring the Electrom 1 LEV to Market
Our crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo will raise the money to create a Production Sample and then Beta Test models. After a reasonable testing period, assembly line production will begin. We don't need a lot of money to get this done; the Electrom has been developed carefully and under budget to this point and we aim to keep it that way. All of the funds raised will go directly to the creation the Electrom 1 Production Sample.
Wait list planWe value transparency, and want to make sure that we set realistic delivery dates and goals. As such, we are not taking big deposits or trying to pre-sell a bunch of Electroms. Instead we are offering wait-list positions with prices based on how soon you want your Electrom. You can get on the wait-list for as little $25, and  if you really believe in the project you could pledge $1000 to be one of the five Beta Testers.

No mystery parts or cheap gimmicksThe Electrom is designed around popular and proven pre-existing parts. This will help get them made quickly and offer end users lots of choice in sourcing replacement parts. We have established relationships with some of the best e-bike and bicycle parts providers out there. All of the components used will be top-of-the-line  and selected for performance and reliability. The first generation of Electrom 1s will be produced on a small scale and sold in easily assembled  kit format. The delivery as a kit will help with shipping costs  and offers flexibility to suit local e-bike laws . Once we have a proven market we will take the next step to true mass-production.
A question of timingMany efforts have been made in the past to bring a single-passenger electric vehicle to market, and most of them failed. Some failed because they were bad ideas, but many failed because neither society nor the technology was ready. We believe that modern population, time,  and environmental pressures have brought us to the point where people are eager to give up their cars in exchange for a vehicle like the Electrom. This combined with the fact that electric vehicle battery and component technology has taken giant steps forward in the last decade leads us to believe that the world is finally ready for LEV's.
Adaptable to e-bike laws in almost any areaThere are a variety of rules for e-bikes for different countries. The Electrom is built on a modular platform that will be able to run a variety of electric drive systems to suit local laws. Whether you need a direct drive hub motor, geared hub motor, or mid-drive system, all are possible with the Electrom. It can qualify as a moped in many countries. The moped designation allows for more power  and a higher top speed than a regular e-bike.
Made in North AmericaA number of well-meaning crowdfunded e-bikes have had delays and other challenges when it comes to getting bikes built in Asia. We have taken steps to avoid this phenomenon by designing a vehicle that is less complicated and uses as many off-the-shelf components as possible. The early Electrom 1s will be built locally to get them to the backers as quickly as possible. Once the Electrom 1 has proven itself, we will work to optimize production on a larger scale.
Hit the ground runningOur first milestone will be building the Electrom 1 Production Sample; this work will start as soon as the campaign is funded. After the Production Sample is complete and some testing has taken place we will invite our Beta Test Backers to review the bike as built.  They will then have the option to exercise their wait-list position. The five Beta Test bikes will be built in Victoria BC and delivered quickly, with the first in buyers' hands as early as December 2018. 
Differences Between the Prototype and the Production Model
We are very happy with the basic design and geometry of the Electrom Prototype but the desire to make it legal in as many areas as possible, combined knowledge gained over two years and 4500+ kilometers of testing has resulted in a few changes:


20"" bicycle / 16"" moped wheels - Some areas define a bicycle as having a minimum wheel size of 20"" outer diameter. To meet this requirement we have outfitted the Electrom 1 with heavy duty 20"" bike wheels. This is the same tire size as the 16"" moped standard, so users will have access to a wide variety of tires styles and tread patterns. This wheel size will also offer a smoother ride on rough roads.

Different rear hatch design - two years of testing have shown that a different style of rear cargo hatch is required. The Electrom 1 hatch will still be removable to carry a passenger, but it will hinge at the back instead of the top.

Lighter weight - The Electrom 1 will make use of lightweight components where necessary to achieve a balance between efficiency and durability. The final vehicle weight is expected to be 120 lbs.


Electrom 1 Specifications:

Welded aluminum Frame.
203 cm / 80 inch wheel base.
55 kilo / 120 lbs weight without batteries.
100 mm/ 4 inches of front and rear suspension travel.
20"" diameter wheels.
Fiberglas and carbon fiber body panels and tailbox.
72 volt battery system (user configurable). Base battery is 72 volt, 20 amp-hour Lithoum pack. Approximately $750 USD landed.
Up to 300km/186 mile range.
Regenerative braking and hydraulic disk brakes
Grin Technologies programmable 72 volt 40 amp controller and Cycle Analyst V3 Console.

4.5 meter/14 foot turning circle.
Able to accommodate rider sizes ranging from 1 meter 52cm / 5' 0""  to  2 meter /  6' 10"".

How Much Will the Electrom 1 Cost? 
It is difficult to give an exact estimate until we have completed the production sample, but we estimate that the Frame kit will sell for $2500 USD, the Base Kit will sell for as low as $4,000 USD, and the Deluxe Kit with full tailbox and front fairing will be around $6000 USD. All of the above options are sold without battery. This will allow the end-user to select a battery that suits their individual needs. As one of the big costs of a battery is the Hazardous Materials Shipping Charge, it doesn't make sense to ship a battery to the Electrom  assembly plant and then on to the final destination. We will provide a list of known reputable local battery suppliers to Electrom purchasers, and should there be no local supply of batteries we will be able to provide a battery at cost.

 

Some Details of the Electrom 1 LEV
Range and Power - The Electrom was designed to be configurable to e-bike rules in as many countries as possible. In its stock configuration it  uses an electric hub motor that easily produces enough power to travel as fast as 60 kph / 40 mph. Using one 72 volt, 20 amp-hour battery and traveling at 32 KPH / 20 mph it has a range of 100 +  kilometers / 62 miles. The frame has room for three such batteries yielding a potential range of 300+ Kilometers / 186 miles.

 
Immune to Traffic Jams - The Electrom is legally a bicycle, and is allowed to lane-split, use bike lanes and the medians on the side of highways.  This and the Electrom’s very narrow profile–less than 60 cm / 24 inches–allows the rider to easily slip through stalled traffic.

 
No complicated gearshifting needed and all the exercise you want - The Generator Drive acts like an automatic transmission for a bike.  At speeds under 10 kilometers / 6 miles-per-hour the rider's effort goes to the back wheel via chain drive and helps the Electrom get up to speed. This is also helpful when they encounter a steep hill because  the rider's pedaling helps the electric motor get the vehicle up the hill. At speeds above 10 kilometers / 6 miles per-hour, riders can pedal at a constant speed and their efforts are converted to electricity to supplement the battery.

With over 1000+ happy Lux board owners around the world, we are proud to launch the LX, adding a sense of adventure to our board mix. We started Lux four years ago and launched our first ever electric longboard the Lux LT. After fulfilling ALL OUR ORDERS, we decided to launch a more X-TREME, EPIC, and adventurous board, the LX. 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
Here at Lux, LX's are in production at our light manufacturing space in Phoenix, AZ. So much thought was put in from specs to design in order to give you a board that looks as epic as it rides.

 What are the differences between the LX and the LX Extreme?The LX Extreme comes with the same internal specs as the Standard LX but with upgraded components that help handle a more extreme Off Road experience! The LX Extreme comes with Military Grade CNC Billet Aluminum Bash Guards, Military Grade CNC Billet Aluminum Motor Mounts, Shred SL200 Off-Road Lights, Shred SL200 Rear Red Lights. How fast does the board go? The Lux LX and Lux LX Extreme have a top speed of 30 MPH. The speed of the board depends on a couple factors such as weight, terrain, and wind. If you weigh more or ride on grass or if there are greater winds, the speed will be slower. How do I control the board? The Lux LX is easily controlled through our ergonomic remote! Simply slide the throttle forward to go and pull back to brake. You can choose from 4 different speed modes and 4 different braking modes to easily customize your ride. What is the range of the board? The Lux LX and the Lux LX Extreme will provide you with a range from 19-25 miles depending on how much you weigh and the terrain you are riding on. If you weigh more, the range will be less. If you weigh less, the range will be greater. How long does it take to change the wheels?Depending on your skill level it can take as little as 5 minutes! How do you change the wheels? Its super easy! The LX comes standard with the two necessary tools to change the wheels: A T-tool and an Allen Wrench! Its as simple as taking off the tire, switching the belt and placing the new tire on!  How long does it take to charge the board?On average it takes 3-4 hours to charge the board with the potential to take longer if it is completely dead. However, with the LX Rapid charger, you can charge the board in up to half the time! What terrain can I ride the board on? With the 2-n-1 interchangeable wheels, the LX can go almost anywhere. The street wheel allows you to travel any road smoothly while the all-terrain wheels allow you to go on grass, hard sand, dirt roads and any gravel. Be sure to clean your board after your off-road travels to help avoid replacement needs.  Why should I consider getting the adventure package?The adventure package is built to increase the hill climb of the board upto 10%. Basically the LX gearing ratio is currently geared more for speed. This is optimal on flatland travel. The adventure package almost doubles the gearing ratio (which lowers the speed and increases the torque). This creates more optimal hill climbing conditions. What are the water restrictions with the board? All Lux Longboards are IP57 water resistant! If you happen to take the board through a puddle, or get it a little wet, it should be fine. All the motors and most of the internal components are sealed! We do however suggest keeping the board out of the rain and not ride while the ground is saturated with water. What type of battery is used?The LX uses 18650 battery technology! The same battery technology used in the Tesla Model X. We use name brand SANYO GA cells. The total size of the battery is a 14Ah 10S4P making a total of 504WH of power. Can I still ride the board if the battery dies? Yes! The board has very little resistance if the battery dies. It can be used like a normal longboard without any power. Will the LX and the LX Extreme be exactly like the pictures?Although we love what we have put into the board, the Lux LX is still getting its finishing touches so design specifications are subject to change. The images provided up above are the latest prototype designs, however, if any changes do occur in either appearance, cost, or function of the board, updates will be made available to you on Indiegogo in the updates section and via email. What ESC is used in the LX? The LX is built with a waterproof 30A ESC. When designing the LX, the Lux Engineers chose to build a custom ESC to optimize for off-road travel. Name brand ESC’s such as Hobbywing simply did not give the LX enough power for off-road travel which is why we built our own.  Can you install cloudwheels on these boards?Yes! The cloud wheels should be interchangeable with the Kegel street adaptor!  Can street wheels be put on these boards? Yes! The LX comes standard with 97mm street tires. You can easily swap between the street wheels and the off-road wheels!  Are the wheels Aluminum? Or what material are the wheels made of?To optimize off-road travel, we decided to injection mold our rims with a high density plastic instead of aluminum! This allows for the board to be light weight and extremely durable!  What wheel core does the LX use? Kegel, ABEC, or something else? The LX uses the Kegel core system! This makes it easily interchangeable with other wheels on the market! 
 
 

 
 
 Do you offer financing?Yes! If you want to purchase the board, but need to finance it, we will be offering financing starting on 6/30! We have paired up with Affirm to offer financing! When will the board be shipped? Once the funds are released from Indiegogo, we can start production on the boards! We expect most orders to ship close to 3-4 months from our light manufacturing space once the funds are released.  Where are the boards shipped from?All boards will ship from our light manufacturing facility in Phoenix, AZ. We get parts of the board manufactured overseas and do partial manufacturing here in the United States!  Do we ship internationally? We do ship internationally! However, there will be different costs associated depending on your location!  Is there a refund policy?Please refer to IndieGoGo's policy HERE. Shortly after an order is placed, we will lock in the contribution. This means we have started placing orders for the components to start the process of manufacturing the board. This means we can’t change or refund the order. When you order a board, we build you a board! Can I pick up my board in Phoenix to avoid shipping charges? Our main priority is to get these boards shipped out to everyone as soon as possible! Because of the delicacy of our system, we will not be offering local pick up so we can speed up the shipping process. 
 
 

 
 
 Is there a warranty on the board?The LX comes with a 6 months manufacturer's warranty! All repairs are done inhouse at our light manufacturing spacing in Phoenix, AZ. With the warranty, we cover the entire board from any defects or malfunctions that happen during standard use. If there are any issues, feel free to reach out to us at customerservice@luxlongboards.com or via phone at 1 (602) 932-2917. Just a reminder, the warranty does not cover any misuse, altercations, tampering or modifications that are done to the board. What happens if my board breaks after the warranty or I break it accidentally? Don’t worry! With our excellent support, we can get you taken care of asap! You can reach out to Lux Longboards with your issue via phone at 1 (602) 932-2917 or through email via customerservice@luxlongboards.com. Who can I contact if I have a question about the purchase?You can reach out to a Lux Longboards representative with any question via phone at 1 (602) 932-2917 or through email via customerservice@luxlongboards.com. Will I actually get a response if I reach out? At Lux, we make you a priority! As one of the few US based E-skate companies, we prioritize any and all communication. You have a question, we are more than happy to help you. You can guarantee to get an answer from us within a day of reaching out! 
 
 

 
 

 Do I have to wear a helmet while riding?You do not have to wear a helmet, but we always recommend wearing a helmet! Accidents happen and we want you to be safe! Is the LX hard to ride? No! The LX is so easy to ride (its actually easier to ride than a traditional skateboard/ longboards). With four different speed modes and four different breaking modes you can easily control your ride. With the larger deck, there is ample space for your feet on the board, giving you increased stability! Can I take the LX on a plane?The LX was designed with a massive battery! It is a little over 5 times over TSA’s watt hour limit. So, unfortunately, you cannot take it on a plane. The easiest way to take it on vacation if you are flying is to send it to your destination via mail (so make sure to keep your box). Most times it costs about the same as checking a bag.",40.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Thank you so much for supporting our first project SDREAM E-Bike. We couldn't be more grateful to witness the success together with our backers! And now we are proud to announce that all the orders from the first project have been shipped properly. We are back, with a new robust beauty.   Are you a daily commuter or a frequent traveler? Are you seeking a new way to get around in the city with a more powerful, comfortable and portable electric bicycle?SDREAM Ur is the smoothest folding e-bike for urban explorations. It brings unprecedented comfy with the innovative rubber anti-vibration damping system, providing the most enjoyable riding experience to the crowded city hassle-free. Powerful, foldable, ultra-lightweight, SDREAM Ur is the next optimal traffic way to freedom.  In the past, riding comfort has been the disadvantage of most portable bikes. To pursue a lighter body, they had to give up the suspension devices at the expense of user comfort.To tackle this, SDREAM has finally developed the patent rubber anti-vibration damping system, it can absorb 95% of the shaking while only takes the weight of a small bottle of water. The durability is 3 times higher than traditional suspensions.From the frame design to the patented hub damping structure, SDREAM Ur achieves the amazingly comfortable riding, as well as the minimalist shape and weight. We chose the premium rust-resistant magnesium alloy to build SDREAM Ur. It makes SDREAM Ur 30% lighter than aluminum alloy ones and much sturdier than carbon fiber. It’s strong to carry a weight of 220lbs/ 100kg, yet its portability makes it ideal for taking with anywhere, no extra sweat needed.You know what, magnesium alloy is recognized as an environmentally friendly material, it greatly reduces the toxic gas and waste liquid during producing carbon fiber.  An electric bike is not only an alternative to polluting vehicles but a more optimized way to go green, go traveling. Powered by an advanced brushless DC Motor, SDREAM Ur can make you go faster at the speed of 20mph (32km/h), and it’s also easy to reach 25mph (40km/h) with your pedaling efforts. SDREAM Ur perfectly optimizes the efficiency between e-power and pedal, smartly making you get through rush-hour as well as reduce the waste of energy. Before you know it, you can easily get the amount of exercise you need for the day while improving city's environment. The enduring lithium-ion battery is hidden in the seat post, charging up from 0-100% only in 4.5 hours (varying from different models ). No key lock needed, you’re able to charge your bike anytime, anywhere, simply remove the seat post as you can.You can go up to 50miles/80km per charge with the long-lasting battery, pairing with the advanced torque sensor which can precisely sense your pedal effort and offer the optimal electric-assist timely. Ur features the easiest folding mechanism, folding down to a third of its volume in less than 6 seconds, making this a perfect portable magic. You can always have SDREAM with you anytime, anywhere, and never worry about Ur bike being stolen.Don’t forget the power of magnet suction buttons, their strong suction ability keeps the folded frame always compact, allowing you to take the bike onto the crowded metro or elevator easily. PRODUCTION PROGRESS

 SDREAM Ur adopted the design of a single-sided front fork. The experiment proved that thanks to the unique physics and asymmetricity of the fork, Ur weighs lighter but truly withstand heavier bending forces and stiffer than a conventional double-sided fork. It's also easier to change your tire without removing the wheel. SDREAM Ur simplifies all tedious and complicated operations smartly, frankly displaying all your cycling efforts: assist levels, speed, trip miles, electricity, etc. Just enjoy the 6 hybrid modes with the standard or upgraded LED dashboard, and experience the speed and convenience SDREAM brings. Anti-dust, waterproof, super easy, you can always view clearly even in the sun. * What are the benefits of the torque sensor?1. It feels more naturally like a bike – you control the speed through your pedals, you don’t have to fiddle with the controls much.2. An e-bike with a torque sensor will use less battery power and your range will be much longer. *Limited 400 pics smartphone mount for early backers.Ur SDREAM is in Pre-production

<p>Boomerang uses advanced motion detection to optimize battery life when stationary.</p>
<p>If your Boomerang is in armed mode and gets moved, real-time location data is streamed to the app for up to 10 hours while the bike is in continuous motion. When the bike becomes stationary again, battery life is extended. Boomerang gives you ample time (days or weeks) to track down your bike if it's stolen and moved between several locations.</p>

<p><strong>Chain-free</strong> - Elbi cycles do away with messy chains that ruin clothes and feature clean belt drives that’ll make your ride smooth. In 1984 Harley Davidson replaced their chains with belt drives, too. Why? Chains require lubrication, they rust, and are susceptible to the weather. Belt drives are more durable, more quiet, and cleaner.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:-1.2pt;""><strong>“We wanted to create a minimalistic design with a nod to 80’s nostalgia</strong>, the era we grew up in. The quality of the bikes back then may have been sub-optimal, but our lives revolve around it and as adults, <strong>we wanted to take its head-turning looks and improve its functionality</strong>,” said Henrik Ahlström. “So we came out with the ELBI, <strong>a bike that is easy to ride and even easier to own and can take you to all the places where you want to go.”</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:-1.2pt;"">The final design of the <strong>bike is primarily driven by function. To keep it lightweight and virtually maintenance free,</strong> the bike is <strong>powered by a Gates reinforced Carbon Belt Drive that last longer than chains and requires no lubrication.</strong> The electric models also feature a <strong>slim and lightweight lithium battery enabling 45-60km (27-40 miles) of range</strong> depending on the battery pack and it can even be removed, while not in use, to be used as a <strong>USB power bank.</strong> With the addition of the brushless Bafang motor on the front wheels, the ELBI bike can tackle any hill with its low-resistance three or eight (upgrade <strong>Plus Package</strong>) - speed motor.</p>

The campaign is finally here and ready to kick-off! We're super excited and proud of our ELBI and the work everyone has put in to make this happen. We're now officially ready, set, GO! to bring this beauty out to all of you.
Welcome ELBI to the new Green World that we start making bike by bike.
 
ELBI, Your Everyday Hero.
Low-Maintenance Bicycles that Make Cycling, Carrying and Owning Easy

ELBI is your everyday hero you can count on day and night. ìt won't let you down!
ELBI Bike mixes BMX features (handlebar, sloping top tube, 20” wheels), mini-bike features (low elongated top tube, upright seating position), carrier bike features (front basket), to create a new typology.
 
Our Unique Product​

Chain-free - Elbi cycles do away with messy chains that ruin clothes and feature clean belt drives that’ll make your ride smooth. In 1984 Harley Davidson replaced their chains with belt drives, too. Why? Chains require lubrication, they rust, and are susceptible to the weather. Belt drives are more durable, more quiet, and cleaner.

Smart oversized front carrier – Designed for convenient city living for all your urban needs. With large storage for a quick and dirty drop of grocery bags. The carrier helps you to get al your everyday needs possible with a smile. The Slim High-Quality Battery is integrated into the front carrier for easy removal.

The Slim High-Quality Battery is integrated into the front carrier for easy removal.
 

Lightweight Aluminum Frame – Unlike conventional steel frames, ELBI bikes is made from strong, lightweight aluminum to make it easy to carry the bike up and down stairs. The aluminum is also rust-proof, making ELBI bikes perfect if you live near the beach or somewhere with rain or snow.
Upright Seating Position – Sore backs can be a byproduct of biking, but not with ELBI. It references a BMX, but holds the body in an upright, heads up position for city commute – ideal navigational position o ensure you feel as good after the ride as you did before.

Henry Thomas Signature Edition

The actor Henry Thomas has appeared in more than 40 movies and is best known for his role as Elliott Taylor in the 1982 movie ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"".
Henry Thomas Signature Edition takes you right back to the 80`s with color inspiration from his BMX bike he used when he was cycling with E.T in the front of the basket, but this time you can fly with the help of electricity to all the places you want to go.
Be Good to the Planet and start cycling instead of taking your car.
 
The Design


 
“We wanted to create a minimalistic design with a nod to 80’s nostalgia, the era we grew up in. The quality of the bikes back then may have been sub-optimal, but our lives revolve around it and as adults, we wanted to take its head-turning looks and improve its functionality,” said Henrik Ahlström. “So we came out with the ELBI, a bike that is easy to ride and even easier to own and can take you to all the places where you want to go.”
The final design of the bike is primarily driven by function. To keep it lightweight and virtually maintenance free, the bike is powered by a Gates reinforced Carbon Belt Drive that last longer than chains and requires no lubrication. The electric models also feature a slim and lightweight lithium battery enabling 45-60km (27-40 miles) of range depending on the battery pack and it can even be removed, while not in use, to be used as a USB power bank. With the addition of the brushless Bafang motor on the front wheels, the ELBI bike can tackle any hill with its low-resistance three or eight (upgrade Plus Package) - speed motor.
 
Man's best friend.


ELBI is the perfect urban commuter that is designed to take on salt, sand, and water. It can carry your loved ones and make your everyday life a little bit easier.

Torque Sensor
incl in model : EL250, EL250+
We’ve engineered a sensor that automatically senses your cycling and produces different electrical signals to guide the motor output depending on where and how you’re riding by the force you ride. Whether you’re cruising down the boardwalk or pedaling up a hill, our torque sensor system optimizes motor output to provide 30% more distance on one charge.

 
 





 
Cadence Sensor
incl in model : EL500, EL500+
cadence sensor uses a magnet on the crank, it turns the motor ON when you start pedaling and turns it OFF when you stop pedaling. It works more or less like a switch. You control the boost level and speed by adjusting the assist mode manually up and down. ELBI 500 and 500+ uses this type of sensor as it is most often used with the throttle only.

 
 





 
Rust-free components
The component has been carefully selected to ensure your e-bike will last for years. It is built to be as rust-free as possible – from top to bottom.

daily commute of one or two people plus their usual luggage load into a safe and effective workout, by monitoring and controlling the level of fitness effort that will help you reach your goals.  DITCH YOUR GYM MEMBERSHIPForget wasting hours idling in traffic every day, only to have to rush to the gym after work. Instead, use your daily commute to improve your health and physical condition while avoiding traffic at the same time. The Xmera e-bike features a BPM (beats per minute) sensor integrated with the e-bike controller (computer of the e-bike) so the motor assistance adjusts to your body's needs and your pre-programmed workout goals.      Now available and included with all ""Plus"" PerksOur sensor is designed to accurately and effectively monitor your heart rate in real time. The Xmera bracelet comes with built-in Bluetooth connectivity and PCG heart rate sensors which pass the information to bike’s controller. Xmera comes with different types of battery cells depending on the model:
Xmera 250:  36V 10AH(Samsung) Lithium-ion Battery
 Xmera 250S: 2 batteries of 36V 17.5AH/24.5AH(Samsung) Lithium-ion Battery Each
Xmera 750: 48V 17.0AH(Samsung) Lithium-ion Battery
Xmera 750S: 2 batteries of 48V 17.0AH(Samsung) Lithium-ion Battery Each
Xmera 500SS: 2 batteries of 48V 14AH/21AH(Samsung) Lithium-ion Battery Each
The controller of the Xmera is designed to recharge the battery while riding the bike and reduces the need to connect it to a power supply.   The sensors can assist the biker in several workout modes. For example, Xmera can facilitate a constant BPM rate while commuting (fat burn mode)  - a real cardio training session, previously only possible in the gym. The major benefit? Save our Xmera owners' precious time and help them improve their health and condition by keeping their bodies in shape.While our core mission is the body and machine harmonization, BPM e-bike cardio assisted technology is just the beginning of our e-bike biometric sensor integrations.












  Xmera mobile app unlocks the e-bike while the integrated GPRS signal continuously communicates with the central server and GNSS updating the real-time location of the e-bike on the smartphone app.Xmera is a medium weight (74 lbs) high performance, long-range electric bicycle and workout machine with a top speed of 20 mph in the US and 24 km/h in the EU. The average battery life ranges from 37 miles (60 km) to 124 miles (200 km) depending on the rider's weight and e-bike's configuration (Xmera comes with a second back-up battery as an add-on option). Xmera is equipped with Bafang hub motors and comes in 2 options:1 motor on the back wheel or 2 motors (back and front wheel) for increased torque and power.",66.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Transform your bike into a folding bike  </h3>
<p>FUBi fixie is designed with minimal changes to the existing bicycle design. FUBi uses only standard bicycle parts except for the frame. This allows you to use your own custom parts or any available standard parts.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459367484/ztbj7jmb5g3xy7sikfu3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>High performance </h3>

<h3>Easy to fold</h3>
<p>FUBi is easy to fold without having to use any tools. It can be folded and unfolded in 5-10 seconds. When used as a fixed-gear it rolls on the front wheel when folded. If used as a single gear (with freewheel) it rolls on both wheels.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Similar to many crowdfunding projects, we face several risks and challenges in undertaking this next step in the evolution of FUBi. The primary risks for us include:</p>
<p>ENGINEERING</p>
<p>We have already completed the prototyping and the test phase of the FUBi fixie to our full satisfaction. In the design and construction, we still have some small issues we want to solve in order that the bike functions better. However, we are very confident that we will be able to find the best solutions to solve these issues.</p>
<p>SUPPLY CHAIN</p>
<p>Many crowdfunding campaigns can encounter problems when taking their prototypes to production. Smooth execution is significant to overcome such risks. <br/>The bikes and the frames will be made by the producers we know and trust. We are therefore confident to be able to produce the bikes on time. However, unexpected things can happen sometimes. If there is a delay, it is for a good reason and most likely because we only ship when the bikes fulfill our requirements.</p>
<p>THE FUBi TEAM</p>
<p>Finding the right people is a challenge for any endeavor. Success in this major step of the evolution of FUBi requires a team of talented, passionate and motivated designers, engineers and entrepreneurs. <br/>Fubicom is an existing business run by a small team of real people with a passion and ambition for new, different and innovative solutions in the field of bicycles. Because of the major undertaking, this means for us that we are already actively looking for new members to join us.</p>

The FUBi team
 
FUBi folding systemThe basic idea with FUBi fixie folding principle is to keep as much of the traditional diamond frame as possible. This allows you to transform your existing full-size bike into a folding bike. This without sacrificing riding performance and looks.The bikeFUBi fixie is a full-size folding bike with the same looks, price and riding features as a ""normal"" fixie/bike, yet can be folded with ease for convenient transport and storage. It's a has full-sized 700C wheels.    


Transform your bike into a folding bike  
FUBi fixie is designed with minimal changes to the existing bicycle design. FUBi uses only standard bicycle parts except for the frame. This allows you to use your own custom parts or any available standard parts.

High performance 
Experience the best riding performance among folding bikes. It has the same performance as a normal fixie.
 

Easy to fold
FUBi is easy to fold without having to use any tools. It can be folded and unfolded in 5-10 seconds. When used as a fixed-gear it rolls on the front wheel when folded. If used as a single gear (with freewheel) it rolls on both wheels.
 

Patented frame technology
FUBI fixie has the FUBI patented frame technology that utilizes the triangular principle in order to have a very rigid and light frame.
 

Secure locking system
The folding system allows you to lock FUBi in a more secure way. Lock it around a pillar with front wheels, frame and pillar all locked together with a U-lock.
 

Affordable
Usually folding bikes are expensive. FUBi fixie offers a competitive pricing that can compete with normal bikes, fixed-gear bikes and single-gear bikes.
 

Single-speed, fixed-gear or 3-speed hub
The bikes have a front and rear brake and a flip-flop hub. The bike can be used as a single-speed or fixed-gear bike by turning the rear wheel around. There is also a 3 speed freewheel hub option.
 

 Where it fits
FUBi fixie fits folded in elevators, metro, bus and in most cars.
 
FUBi fixie will be made in Finland to ensure the right production quality. The bikes will be manufactured by our manufacturing partner and our team specialized in both manufacturing and bicycles. 
 Fubi will be made of quality parts.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>The risks and challenges that we face, are based on the molding of the frame. We must ensure that we meet the perfect balance of a water resistant ebike, while being able to do any minor modifications like swapping out parts. With anything that is electric it needs to be as sealed securely to avoid corrosion, and as we all know getting caught in the rain is always a real possibility when riding your bike.</p>
<p>With that being said, we have more than 10 years experience developing ebikes, fulfillment, testing, quality assurance. So when we deliver, we truly deliver. No surprises!</p>

Own your very own EC1 from $999 USD!!!The EC1 Carbon frame weighs only 1.15 kg/2.53 lbsModular – Exchange the rear wheel with the standard wheel provided and remove the Battery Pack to switch your carbon fiber ebike into a fully functioning bicycle. Save energy for when you really need it with the pedal assist or drop the weight even more and switch to the regular wheel for when you feel like some exercise.Choose whether you want the motor in the front or the rearLightweight – The EC1 uses carbon fiber frame and aluminum alloy components to reduce the weight significantly with the bike weighing only 15.5 kg/34 lbs. Additional carbon fiber upgrades to the rims, handlebars and more can be done to reduce the total weight of the bike even further.The EC1 weighs only 34 lbs/15.5 kg!Built to Last – Using unidirectional carbon fiber. We offer the strongest weave of carbon fiber compared to the regular 12K or 3K tow. By doing this we have reduced the weight significantly without sacrificing the structural integrity of the bicycle.Streamlined – By having the slim frame design you significantly reduce air resistance so you can hit speeds you couldn’t imagine. We also offer racing bike handle bars for those who want to take it to the next level.We understand that in trying to appeal to all clients, we must cater to them! We allow customization of frame size between 480 mm - 560 mm upon ordering your bike, and if you don't know which size is best for you can refer to this chart: All backers will be contacted at the end of the campaign to find out what size of frame you want! Indiegogo is a great platform to see if there is interest in our vision. Does the world want a Carbon fiber ebike/bicycle under $2,000? Indiegogo opens the doors to the world’s community and gives us the answer. Plus, Daymak’s goal is to reduce the carbon foot print one ebike at a time and Indiegogo helps us share that vision with the world!The funds raised will be used for:
Finishing the frame mold
Finalizing the design of the EC1
EN 15194 testing & certification for Europe
Develop an international network of service dealers

Here is our expected timeline from development to delivery for the EC1.




We want to thank you all in advance for even taking the time to check out this project. We aim to show the world that we can escape the habits of old and make new trends. Trends that are, stylish, trends that are innovative, trends that are good for the planet.

Risks and challenges
The risks and challenges that we face, are based on the molding of the frame. We must ensure that we meet the perfect balance of a water resistant ebike, while being able to do any minor modifications like swapping out parts. With anything that is electric it needs to be as sealed securely to avoid corrosion, and as we all know getting caught in the rain is always a real possibility when riding your bike.
With that being said, we have more than 10 years experience developing ebikes, fulfillment, testing, quality assurance. So when we deliver, we truly deliver. No surprises!",26.0,1,"2 Campaigns

Off?</strong></p><p>Your Smart Ped wakes up when you reach 6 km/h, then your smart ped will turn off automatically after 2 minutes when no action is detected. If you connected with your smartphone, the turn-off time is raised to 10 minutes.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How long does it take to fully charge the battery?</strong></p><p>Approximately 2,5 hrs when the battery pack is completely empty. We also offer a car charger that can use the 12V plug of your car/RV to charge your Smart Ped!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Will I damage the battery if I run it all the way dead?</strong></p><p>No. There’s no need to worry about over discharging your battery from riding. We have designed the system to always stay within a safe operating range while in use. However, do not let your Smart Ped stays empty for long periods of time, otherwise please charge it at least once every 45 days.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can I make it go faster than the listed top speed?</strong></p><p>We limit the speeds for safety. Sorry, we won’t raise the max limit for anyone nor can you access the software in any way to change that yourself as higher speeds can damage the electronics. Any alteration, tampering or modification of the electronics, battery, controller, throttle, motor, circuitry or related electrical wiring will not be serviced or supported by Smart Ped and will void the warranty. What backers do on their own after they receive their models outside the warranty is up to them.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How does the regenerative braking (KERS) work?</strong></p><p>Regenerative braking returns charge to the battery whenever you command the Smart Ped to slow down. Examples include using braking to stop, or braking while going down a hill. Simply coasting, or kicking without engaging the brake does not put any amount of charge back into the battery</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can I ride it off-road, jump off ramps/curbs or other hardcore trick riding?</strong></p><p>We have engineered the scooter to handle shock and vibration, riding off curbs, doing jumps/hops, etc. To prolong the life of the product we recommend minimizing stunt riding. However, the scooter can ride off-road in general since it’s components are sealed from dust, dirt and water, or on grass or hard pack dirt. Even with the thick 16"" wheels, we recommend slower speeds on loose gravel as the product was mainly designed for and performs best on paved or urban street riding and for occasional rough terrain. Please always check tire pressure before riding. Low tire pressure may result in loss of range and damage to the rims / frame.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How do I know when the battery is low?</strong></p><p>Check easily the battery charge indicator within the BitRide app, your Smart Ped travel console.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How long of a lifecycle does the battery have?</strong></p><p>Smart Ped uses only premium lithium cells in its battery packs. Battery pack is guaranteed for 2 years, but Riders can expect their battery to last many more (approx 5 yrs) under normal daily use.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Is the Smart Ped rustproof and waterproof?</strong></p><p>IP54 Water resistant body &amp; IPX5 Weatherproof battery/motor/controller electronics system. The scooter is water resistant (splash proof) during normal riding but it goes without saying that it should not be submerged under water. The sensitive and sophisticated electronics are sealed within the water &amp; dustproof frame and the throttle. Never expose the enclosed electronics/wiring to water. Riding the scooter in wet environments like rain, snow or mud can still cause the bearings and hardware to corrode over time requiring regular replacement long term. In addition, riding in wet conditions is slippery and extremely dangerous on any scooter, so we don’t advise it on a regular basis. Damage due to water is not covered under your warranty. Always wipe off water afterward and keep it dry to preserve the scooters life. It is always best to store the scooter indoors (in a garage or closet) rather than outdoors for prolonged storage.</p><p> </p><p><strong>If the battery runs out can I kick with the scooter?</strong></p><p>Yes, absolutely. The Smart Ped is designed to be kicked along just like any other kick scooter with the electrics either turned on or off.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Do I need a special license, insurance or registration to ride a Smart Ped?</strong></p><p>Nope! According to European regulation, the NEW Smart Ped is categorized as a Pedelec25 and does not require a license. However, we recommend that riders are at least 14 years old and wear a helmet at all times. Check your local and state laws for requirements specific to your area. Smart Ped is legal and classified as an electric bike almost everywhere, and as such don’t require a special license. There are a few jurisdictions with more specific laws and we recommend to check those before riding if you are concerned.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Is it legal to ride the Smart Ped in my country?</strong></p><p>European and US laws may vary. Many state laws approve the use of electric scooters in bike lanes of general road traffic and of course on private land and off-road. All countries have their own rules on light electric vehicles so it’s best to consult with your local transportation authority. Helmets are required by law in some places and optional in other places. Please check your local regulations</p><p> </p><p><strong>When does it ship?</strong></p><p>We want to make sure the quality is perfect so we don’t want to rush them out sooner than promised, so will be ready to ship starting February 1st. Please check out our ""production timeline"" and we’ll be updating weekly as the production process continues to see if we can speed up the process and shipping.</p><p> </p><p><strong>I want to be a rep/distributor/retailer, how do I start?</strong></p><p>We are open to amazing retailers worldwide that have awesome physical retail spaces.

What you saw in the videos above is real and functioning.We are experienced and ready to deliver according to plans, as we have worked for over 4 years in delivering products for smart commuting.Tiny inconveniences happen from time to time, and if they do, we will let you know and work out a solution.Our products are assembled and shipped from Milan, Italy  Is Smart Ped an electric scooter?No, the Smart Ped is an e-kick bike. Smart Ped has an electric motor but no control knobs. You just need one kick to activate the engine: after that, you won’t need to do anything else for almost a kilometer. How does the innovative engine that runs the motor work?The technology behind it is quite complicated, but it is very easy to explain. One kick, and it’s working. You brake, and it’s slowing down and it’s stopping What if I want to kick less than a kilometer?You just need to open Bitride app and change the ‘kick assist’ setting with a click. Is Smart Ped legal? Can I use it in my city?The new Smart Ped is categorized as a Pedelec25 so you can use it in your city without any worries. Why would I have to support you?The new Smart Ped is ready to go and ready to be produced. We just need your help to make it real!  Is there a warranty on my Smart Ped?Yes, there is a limited warranty of 2 years on your Smart Ped. How do I turn on the e-kick bike? Off?Your Smart Ped wakes up when you reach 6 km/h, then your smart ped will turn off automatically after 2 minutes when no action is detected. If you connected with your smartphone, the turn-off time is raised to 10 minutes. How long does it take to fully charge the battery?Approximately 2,5 hrs when the battery pack is completely empty. We also offer a car charger that can use the 12V plug of your car/RV to charge your Smart Ped! Will I damage the battery if I run it all the way dead?No. There’s no need to worry about over discharging your battery from riding. We have designed the system to always stay within a safe operating range while in use. However, do not let your Smart Ped stays empty for long periods of time, otherwise please charge it at least once every 45 days. Can I make it go faster than the listed top speed?We limit the speeds for safety. Sorry, we won’t raise the max limit for anyone nor can you access the software in any way to change that yourself as higher speeds can damage the electronics. Any alteration, tampering or modification of the electronics, battery, controller, throttle, motor, circuitry or related electrical wiring will not be serviced or supported by Smart Ped and will void the warranty. What backers do on their own after they receive their models outside the warranty is up to them. How does the regenerative braking (KERS) work?Regenerative braking returns charge to the battery whenever you command the Smart Ped to slow down. Examples include using braking to stop, or braking while going down a hill. Simply coasting, or kicking without engaging the brake does not put any amount of charge back into the battery Can I ride it off-road, jump off ramps/curbs or other hardcore trick riding?We have engineered the scooter to handle shock and vibration, riding off curbs, doing jumps/hops, etc. To prolong the life of the product we recommend minimizing stunt riding. However, the scooter can ride off-road in general since it’s components are sealed from dust, dirt and water, or on grass or hard pack dirt. Even with the thick 16"" wheels, we recommend slower speeds on loose gravel as the product was mainly designed for and performs best on paved or urban street riding and for occasional rough terrain. Please always check tire pressure before riding. Low tire pressure may result in loss of range and damage to the rims / frame. How do I know when the battery is low?Check easily the battery charge indicator within the BitRide app, your Smart Ped travel console. How long of a lifecycle does the battery have?Smart Ped uses only premium lithium cells in its battery packs. Battery pack is guaranteed for 2 years, but Riders can expect their battery to last many more (approx 5 yrs) under normal daily use. Is the Smart Ped rustproof and waterproof?IP54 Water resistant body & IPX5 Weatherproof battery/motor/controller electronics system. The scooter is water resistant (splash proof) during normal riding but it goes without saying that it should not be submerged under water. The sensitive and sophisticated electronics are sealed within the water & dustproof frame and the throttle. Never expose the enclosed electronics/wiring to water. Riding the scooter in wet environments like rain, snow or mud can still cause the bearings and hardware to corrode over time requiring regular replacement long term. In addition, riding in wet conditions is slippery and extremely dangerous on any scooter, so we don’t advise it on a regular basis. Damage due to water is not covered under your warranty. Always wipe off water afterward and keep it dry to preserve the scooters life. It is always best to store the scooter indoors (in a garage or closet) rather than outdoors for prolonged storage. If the battery runs out can I kick with the scooter?Yes, absolutely. The Smart Ped is designed to be kicked along just like any other kick scooter with the electrics either turned on or off. Do I need a special license, insurance or registration to ride a Smart Ped?Nope! According to European regulation, the NEW Smart Ped is categorized as a Pedelec25 and does not require a license. However, we recommend that riders are at least 14 years old and wear a helmet at all times. Check your local and state laws for requirements specific to your area. Smart Ped is legal and classified as an electric bike almost everywhere, and as such don’t require a special license. There are a few jurisdictions with more specific laws and we recommend to check those before riding if you are concerned. Is it legal to ride the Smart Ped in my country?European and US laws may vary. Many state laws approve the use of electric scooters in bike lanes of general road traffic and of course on private land and off-road. All countries have their own rules on light electric vehicles so it’s best to consult with your local transportation authority. Helmets are required by law in some places and optional in other places. Please check your local regulations When does it ship?We want to make sure the quality is perfect so we don’t want to rush them out sooner than promised, so will be ready to ship starting February 1st. Please check out our ""production timeline"" and we’ll be updating weekly as the production process continues to see if we can speed up the process and shipping. I want to be a rep/distributor/retailer, how do I start?We are open to amazing retailers worldwide that have awesome physical retail spaces. If you have a retail store you would like to carry Smart Peds in, inquire by emailing us at dealers@flykly.com. How can I contact you?You can email us anytime at hello@flykly.com or like us on Facebook, follow us on Instagram and Twitter, and subscribe on YouTube!",31.0,0,"2 Campaigns

The hardware is becoming more expensive to maintain and there is no prospect of any software upgrade in the future. </p><p>The BlueMAX adapter enables you to access the same engine data as the MFD uses but stream it wirelessly via Bluetooth to a portable device such as a phone or tablet allowing easier and more versatile ways to view the data.</p><h3>Benefits</h3><ul>
<li>Redundancy - if your MFD fails, or has to be removed for maintenance you can still see all your engine data.</li>
<li>Features - the BlueMAX software application goes beyond the MFD user interface, offering higher resolution logging, individual fuel tank tracking, easier data uploads and much more.</li>
<li>The option to completely remove the MFD - virtually all the other functions of the MFD can already be replicated on a portable device - with BlueMAX engine monitoring the last reason to keep the legacy MFD disappears.</li>
<li>Customisation - you may want to run your engine more conservatively than the redline and caution limits that are hardwired into the MFD - the BlueMAX app will allow you to choose your own limits and be alerted when they are reached.</li>
<li>Logging - instead of the 6 second data logging interval used by the MFD, BlueMAX logs engine data every second at a higher resolution. Uploading log files to SavvyAnalysis or Cirrusreports is much easier - just connect your portable device to WiFi or a mobile network and upload instantly - no need to be at the plane, on ground power, with a carefully formatted USB stick.</li>
</ul><h3>The Project</h3><p>Right now prototype hardware is working and has been installed into one aircraft. The software app is working on Android and has been tested on multiple devices.

<p>Let’s face it, getting around in a city can be a real pain in the butt.  The problem is that most trips are short, and existing options just don't cut it.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Cars</b> are expensive / hard to park / stuck in traffic</p></li>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Buses</b> are slow / unreliable / stuck in traffic</p></li>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Motorcycles</b> are heavy / require a special license</p></li>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Bicycles</b> are exhausting / range-limited / slow</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>The M-1 solves these problems in a way that makes you look forward to getting around in your city, whether it is your trip to work, to get a burrito across town, or just for a joyride.  Don’t waste time in traffic or looking for parking; spend your time doing things you love...like riding your M-1.</p>
<p>In addition to the nuisance of parking and traffic, there is a need for renewable-energy-powered vehicles.  The M-1 is not only fully-electric, but it uses the most environmentally friendly lithium chemistry available, and our patented batteries are 100% serviceable and 100% recyclable. </p>

<p>We have seen a number of projects delayed for over a year due to poor planning and execution.  Many of these companies used too much smoke and mirrors in their campaign, and their design was not ready for production.  Others had a refined prototype, but their inability to scale to large orders resulted in long delays and unsatisfied supporters.</p>
<p>At Bolt Motorbikes, three years of nights and weekends have been devoted to developing the next generation motorbike.  For the last two years, our full-time efforts have been on the M-1 with a focus on design for manufacture.  We have created multiple prototypes, tested and refined our electronics, and we’ve had over 250 real people ACTUALLY RIDE our motorbikes. </p>
<p>Our years of experience in product design has taught us that you don’t make 100 in the first run.  You make a handful to iron out the process.  The next 20 validate the process so that we can scale to 100 and more.  This scaling concept is embraced in our production plan and reflected in our rewards.</p>
<p>From now until our bikes roll off the line, we have a few areas of focus:</p>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<ul>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Refine the UI and Bluetooth connectivity</p></li>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Develop cloud-based data logging</p></li>

<li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Order large batch of big-ticket items</p></li>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Refine tooling for body and plastics fabrication</p></li>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Assembly refinement</p></li>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Production testing</p></li>

<p><span>Bringing an electric vehicle to production has high up-front costs.  Your support will help bring production cost down by allowing for larger orders on big-ticket items. Your support will also help develop next-generation tooling and fixtures for ease of manufacturing and assembly.  This allows us to continue to offer the M-1 at the competitive price of $5,495.</span></p>
<p>Having proven the concept and technology of the M-1 with over 4,000 miles of aggressive testing, we want to get these beauties into your hands.  Your feedback will help us continue to make the best motorbike that meets the needs of real riders.</p>
<p>Support from the Indiegogo community also reassures us that we are on the right path.  It also uncovers deficiencies that we might have overlooked.  With such a diverse audience, Indiegogo is a great way to stay in touch with riders of all types.</p>Please share our campaign through social media and your friends.</div>

<p>The risks associated with this project are essentially the same as you would find taking any ambitious technological project to production.  We worked hard to minimize risk in all aspects of the project.</p>
<p>• <b>Reliability</b>: Some projects fail because their products are not reliable or rugged enough for consumer use.  Our motorbikes have over 4,000 miles of real-world testing of the chassis, drive train, and electronics.</p>
<p>• <b>Sourcing</b>: A risk that many hardware projects face is that of discontinued items. Our team has experience with production volumes in the thousands-per-week range.  We’ve learned the value of reliable sources and secondary suppliers for key items and embrace that philosophy in our motorbikes.</p>
<p>• <b>Safety</b>: Particularly with electric vehicles, it is important to have redundant systems.  We only use quality electronics and assembly practices, and all of our motorbikes have redundant safety built-in.</p>
<p>• <b>Scalability</b>: Another area many projects fail is inability to meet higher-than-anticipated demand.  Our suppliers can handle larger orders, and our assembly story leverages modular subassemblies to minimize downtime and switching between tools.  We have also implemented product lifecycle monitoring on all parts.</p>We have an aggressive execution plan, and are ready to face the challenges ahead.</div>

<p><b><i>How fast does it go?</i></b></p>
<p>To meet California electric bicycle regulations, Economy Mode is tuned for a top speed of 20 mph. For off-road use, engage Sport Mode to reach 40 mph and higher power.  </p>
<p><b><i>How far can it go?</i></b></p>
<p>In Economy Mode and cruising at 20 mph on a bicycle path, the M-1 can travel up to 50 miles (30-35 in city) on a single charge and WITHOUT PEDALING ONCE.  For the adventurous (and “for off-road use only”), activate Sport Mode for a thrilling 5.5kW, 40 mph ride for 20-30 miles.  </p>
<p><b><i>How do I charge it?</i></b></p>
<p>Our standard 5-hour smart charger carefully manages battery health and ensures maximum range.  Simply plug one end of the charging brick into any standard wall outlet, the other into the bike, and press GO.</p>
<p>If you live in an apartment and don’t have a garage, simply remove the batteries with the theft-resistant quick-release, lock your bike outside, and charge your batteries inside using our charging adaptor. </p>
<p><b><i>Really... No license required?</i></b></p>
<p>Correct!  The M-1’s Economy Mode is limited to a top speed of 20 mph and 1,000 watts to comply with California electric bicycle regulations.  Each state may have its own restrictions which you can view <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bicycle_laws#United_States%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p>In California, as long as you are 16 years or older and wear a bicycle helmet, you can ride an M-1,  and you don’t need a license, registration or insurance. </p>
<p><b><i>What do I do if I run out of batteries?</i></b></p>
<p>You can actually set the M-1 onto its center stand and charge the batteries by pedaling.  However, conservation of energy suggests that you are just as well off pedaling home.</p>
<p><b><i>How long do the batteries last?</i></b></p>
<p>Our patented Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries are rated for over 2,000 cycles before any noticeable reduction in performance.  What that means is that you can ride your M-1 30 miles a day, every day for 5.5 years.  Just like a Tesla, your batteries will last 5-8 years depending on how hard you ride.</p>
<p><b><i>What is the maintenance schedule?</i></b></p>
<p>Unlike vehicles with internal combustion engines, the vibrations that the M-1 experiences are far less, so nuts and bolts don’t loosen over time.  With no oil to change or valves to adjust, the M-1 saves you even more money.  Just like with a bicycle, periodic chain, brakes and tire maintenance are required.  The M-1 is smart enough to know when it is time to perform routine maintenance.</p>
<p><b><i>I've never ridden a motorcycle, will I be able to learn?</i></b></p>
<p>If you can ride a bicycle you can ride an M-1.  We have people who never twisted a throttle as well as experienced motorcyclists hop on and effortlessly ride away. </p>
<p><b><i>How does the M-1 handle rain?</i></b></p>
<p>The M-1 performs flawlessly in rain, though just as with a bicycle or a motorcycle, extra caution must be used for safety and maneuverability.  You can actually ride the M-1 under water (assuming it has very low ionic content), though it is not recommended.</p>
<p><b><i>Where is the M-1 built?</i></b></p>
<p>We are proud to say that the M-1 is built in the USA.  In fact, we just outgrew our home in San Francisco's Richmond district and will be moving to a sweet new home just south of San Francisco in sunny Brisbane.  It will serve as out new Bolt Labs for development and construction, showroom, and demo rides.  Drop by to say hello!</p>
<p><b><i>What does the 1 year warranty cover?</i></b></p>
<p>Our warranty covers all manufacturing defects and not parts with damage due to abuse or misuse.  We provide technical support and consultation.</p>
<p>This warranty is effective only if the product is used under normal conditions for its intended purpose and the product receives all necessary maintenance and adjustments.  We reserve the right to determine what damage is due to defective materials and what is due to product abuse or misuse.  All warranties are void if abuse or misuse is detected.  </p>
<p>This warranty extends only to the original customer and is non-transferrable.</p>
<p>Common wear items are not covered under warranty, such as tires, brakes, lights, rubber covers, seat covers, and other plastic parts. </p>
<p><b><i>Does the warranty cover me if I don’t live in California?</i></b></p>
<p>The same as above.  However, if a shipment is required, you must pay for the shipment of the broken part to our service center via UPS, FedEx, or US Postal. When we receive the broken part, we will ship you a replacement part free of charge.</p>
<p><b><i>I'm tall.  Will this work for me?</i></b></p>
<p>We’ve had people as tall as 6'7"" ride an M-1.  If you’re shorter than that, the M-1 is perfect for you.  Actually, the taller you are, the more like a supersport motorcycle it feels.  We are motorcycle riders and particularly love supersport, so that was our inspiration.  We think you will like it as well.</p>
<p><b><i>I'm short.  Will this work for me?</i></b></p>
<p>We've had petite 5'0"" ladies hop on the M-1 and transform into total badasses (5'0"" men do the same).  The M-1 is light enough to be comfortably managed by a smaller person.  We suggest riders are at least 4'11"" to ride. </p>
<p><b><i>Is this M-1 model the same for men and women?</i></b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">It sure is.  Women and men love the M-1 equally and every test rider comes back with a grin that just won't quit. </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p><b><i>Is there a weight limit?</i></b></p>
<p>The M-1 accommodates 2 riders or up to 350lbs.  Passenger pegs are sold separately through our website.</p>
<p><b><i>What about theft?</i></b></p>
<p>There is no substitute for good judgment, and that includes where you lock your  M-1.  Nothing is theft-proof but we can slow thieves down.  First, the M-1 is keyless and password protected.  Only you and authorized users can start your M-1.  When locking outside, we recommend a 9"" U-lock that you can buy at any bicycle shop, hardware store, or online.  Simply lock your M-1 to a bicycle rack as you would a regular bicycle, and your M-1 should be right where you left it when you return.</p>
<p><b><i>Can I customize my bike?</i></b></p>Not quite yet.  Currently, the M-1 Bolt Motorbike is available in Classic Black, but we're working on other color schemes and aftermarket upgrades including passenger pegs, storage and basket options, extra batteries, and more.  Everything not listed here will be available through our website, so stay tuned.  If you have specific requests or cool ideas, please contact us directly...we wanna hear from you!<br/>

There is something inherently cool about motorcycles.  The M-1 delivers freedom and style with a twist of the throttle.  On an M-1, you feel like a superhero everywhere you go.  Hills flatten, distances shorten, and you don't have to pedal once.
The M-1 will turn heads and take you anywhere at anytime - just twist and go.  If you can ride a bicycle, you can ride an M-1.  There are no gears to shift, no clutch to grab, and the ride is whisper quiet.  Go faster and farther than any bicycle and get to places motorcycles can't.

The ride experience is at the heart of our design process.  As passionate motorcycle riders, we set out to make a motorbike that we were excited to ride, but also that anybody can ride.  We have riders who had never twisted a throttle hop on, and in seconds, they are riding like naturals.Cruising in the park, commuting to work, riding doubles, or tearing up the twisties, riders find new reasons to get out on an M-1.  And the best part is that you can do it without a license, registration, or insurance.  







Playboy  - “Part of it is the cool factor.”



Cool Material  - “The perfect vehicle for the city dweller: an e-bike that effortlessly blends the style of a vintage motorcycle with the practically of a bicycle.”

Ferrvor  - “Password protected, a USB charger for your phone, and connect digitally through your smartphone, makes it one of the most hi-tech and functional electric bikes out there.”


Motorbike Writer - “A bike that gets it right with styling, practicality and technology.”


Engadget - “For urban environmentalists tired of showing up to work all sweaty, it could be the ultimate commuter.”

Top Speed - “There are a multitude of things to like about the Bolt M-1.”

The M-1 has rugged construction and is designed to handle mean city streets and off-road trails in all-weather conditions.
In Economy Mode, the M-1 is tuned to meet California electric bicycle regulations, but don't be fooled.  At 20 mph and with a range of 35 miles (city), you can ride all day, use the bicycle lane, and park anywhere.  You can even cruise into Golden Gate Park on Sundays when it is closed to vehicular traffic!


Sport Mode delivers pure power, style, and attitude.  Thrill-seekers and the adventurous can rip at speeds of 40 mph and have enough torque to climb the nastiest hills in San Francisco.  Feel the rush of a 110cc motorcycle without the responsibility of a 300+ pound machine.

Our 5-hour smart charger carefully manages battery health and ensures maximum range.  Simply plug one end of the charger into a standard wall outlet, the other into the bike, and press “GO.""  Five hours and twenty-one cents of electricity later, you are ready to ride again.

We designed the M-1 with city-dwellers in mind.  No garage, no problem.  Our patented battery quick-release allows you to lock your M-1 outside, remove the batteries, and charge inside.








Let’s face it, getting around in a city can be a real pain in the butt.  The problem is that most trips are short, and existing options just don't cut it.


Cars are expensive / hard to park / stuck in traffic
Buses are slow / unreliable / stuck in traffic
Motorcycles are heavy / require a special license
Bicycles are exhausting / range-limited / slow



The M-1 solves these problems in a way that makes you look forward to getting around in your city, whether it is your trip to work, to get a burrito across town, or just for a joyride.  Don’t waste time in traffic or looking for parking; spend your time doing things you love...like riding your M-1.
In addition to the nuisance of parking and traffic, there is a need for renewable-energy-powered vehicles.  The M-1 is not only fully-electric, but it uses the most environmentally friendly lithium chemistry available, and our patented batteries are 100% serviceable and 100% recyclable.

This limited run of 100 M-1 motorbikes is only shipping within the U.S.  For the rest of the world, don’t worry, your motorbikes are coming.  Even within the U.S., there is quite a range of shipping options, and we want to get you your M-1 as quickly and affordably as possible.  We will coordinate tax and shipping with each customer at the close of the campaign.

Bolt Labs pick-up in Brisbane, CA- Free
San Francisco Bay Area (within 100 miles of Bolt Labs in Brisbane) – $75
Everywhere else in the U.S. - we are negotiating nationwide shipping rates, but plan for $300 - $700 depending on your location and delivery arrangements.




We have seen a number of projects delayed for over a year due to poor planning and execution.  Many of these companies used too much smoke and mirrors in their campaign, and their design was not ready for production.  Others had a refined prototype, but their inability to scale to large orders resulted in long delays and unsatisfied supporters.
At Bolt Motorbikes, three years of nights and weekends have been devoted to developing the next generation motorbike.  For the last two years, our full-time efforts have been on the M-1 with a focus on design for manufacture.  We have created multiple prototypes, tested and refined our electronics, and we’ve had over 250 real people ACTUALLY RIDE our motorbikes. 
Our years of experience in product design has taught us that you don’t make 100 in the first run.  You make a handful to iron out the process.  The next 20 validate the process so that we can scale to 100 and more.  This scaling concept is embraced in our production plan and reflected in our rewards.
From now until our bikes roll off the line, we have a few areas of focus:



Refine the UI and Bluetooth connectivity
Develop cloud-based data logging
Package our charger solution
Order large batch of big-ticket items
Refine tooling for body and plastics fabrication
Assembly refinement
Production testing
First shipment





Bringing an electric vehicle to production has high up-front costs.  Your support will help bring production cost down by allowing for larger orders on big-ticket items. Your support will also help develop next-generation tooling and fixtures for ease of manufacturing and assembly.  This allows us to continue to offer the M-1 at the competitive price of $5,495.
Having proven the concept and technology of the M-1 with over 4,000 miles of aggressive testing, we want to get these beauties into your hands.  Your feedback will help us continue to make the best motorbike that meets the needs of real riders.
Support from the Indiegogo community also reassures us that we are on the right path.  It also uncovers deficiencies that we might have overlooked.  With such a diverse audience, Indiegogo is a great way to stay in touch with riders of all types.Please share our campaign through social media and your friends.



The risks associated with this project are essentially the same as you would find taking any ambitious technological project to production.  We worked hard to minimize risk in all aspects of the project.
• Reliability: Some projects fail because their products are not reliable or rugged enough for consumer use.  Our motorbikes have over 4,000 miles of real-world testing of the chassis, drive train, and electronics.
• Sourcing: A risk that many hardware projects face is that of discontinued items. Our team has experience with production volumes in the thousands-per-week range.  We’ve learned the value of reliable sources and secondary suppliers for key items and embrace that philosophy in our motorbikes.
• Safety: Particularly with electric vehicles, it is important to have redundant systems.  We only use quality electronics and assembly practices, and all of our motorbikes have redundant safety built-in.
• Scalability: Another area many projects fail is inability to meet higher-than-anticipated demand.  Our suppliers can handle larger orders, and our assembly story leverages modular subassemblies to minimize downtime and switching between tools.  We have also implemented product lifecycle monitoring on all parts.We have an aggressive execution plan, and are ready to face the challenges ahead.



How fast does it go?
To meet California electric bicycle regulations, Economy Mode is tuned for a top speed of 20 mph. For off-road use, engage Sport Mode to reach 40 mph and higher power.  
How far can it go?
In Economy Mode and cruising at 20 mph on a bicycle path, the M-1 can travel up to 50 miles (30-35 in city) on a single charge and WITHOUT PEDALING ONCE.  For the adventurous (and “for off-road use only”), activate Sport Mode for a thrilling 5.5kW, 40 mph ride for 20-30 miles.  
How do I charge it?
Our standard 5-hour smart charger carefully manages battery health and ensures maximum range.  Simply plug one end of the charging brick into any standard wall outlet, the other into the bike, and press GO.
If you live in an apartment and don’t have a garage, simply remove the batteries with the theft-resistant quick-release, lock your bike outside, and charge your batteries inside using our charging adaptor. 
Really... No license required?
Correct!  The M-1’s Economy Mode is limited to a top speed of 20 mph and 1,000 watts to comply with California electric bicycle regulations.  Each state may have its own restrictions which you can view here.
In California, as long as you are 16 years or older and wear a bicycle helmet, you can ride an M-1,  and you don’t need a license, registration or insurance. 
What do I do if I run out of batteries?
You can actually set the M-1 onto its center stand and charge the batteries by pedaling.  However, conservation of energy suggests that you are just as well off pedaling home.
How long do the batteries last?
Our patented Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries are rated for over 2,000 cycles before any noticeable reduction in performance.  What that means is that you can ride your M-1 30 miles a day, every day for 5.5 years.  Just like a Tesla, your batteries will last 5-8 years depending on how hard you ride.
What is the maintenance schedule?
Unlike vehicles with internal combustion engines, the vibrations that the M-1 experiences are far less, so nuts and bolts don’t loosen over time.  With no oil to change or valves to adjust, the M-1 saves you even more money.  Just like with a bicycle, periodic chain, brakes and tire maintenance are required.  The M-1 is smart enough to know when it is time to perform routine maintenance.
I've never ridden a motorcycle, will I be able to learn?
If you can ride a bicycle you can ride an M-1.  We have people who never twisted a throttle as well as experienced motorcyclists hop on and effortlessly ride away. 
How does the M-1 handle rain?
The M-1 performs flawlessly in rain, though just as with a bicycle or a motorcycle, extra caution must be used for safety and maneuverability.  You can actually ride the M-1 under water (assuming it has very low ionic content), though it is not recommended.
Where is the M-1 built?
We are proud to say that the M-1 is built in the USA.  In fact, we just outgrew our home in San Francisco's Richmond district and will be moving to a sweet new home just south of San Francisco in sunny Brisbane.  It will serve as out new Bolt Labs for development and construction, showroom, and demo rides.  Drop by to say hello!
What does the 1 year warranty cover?
Our warranty covers all manufacturing defects and not parts with damage due to abuse or misuse.  We provide technical support and consultation.
This warranty is effective only if the product is used under normal conditions for its intended purpose and the product receives all necessary maintenance and adjustments.  We reserve the right to determine what damage is due to defective materials and what is due to product abuse or misuse.  All warranties are void if abuse or misuse is detected.  
This warranty extends only to the original customer and is non-transferrable.
Common wear items are not covered under warranty, such as tires, brakes, lights, rubber covers, seat covers, and other plastic parts. 
Does the warranty cover me if I don’t live in California?
The same as above.  However, if a shipment is required, you must pay for the shipment of the broken part to our service center via UPS, FedEx, or US Postal. When we receive the broken part, we will ship you a replacement part free of charge.
I'm tall.  Will this work for me?
We’ve had people as tall as 6'7"" ride an M-1.  If you’re shorter than that, the M-1 is perfect for you.  Actually, the taller you are, the more like a supersport motorcycle it feels.  We are motorcycle riders and particularly love supersport, so that was our inspiration.  We think you will like it as well.
I'm short.  Will this work for me?
We've had petite 5'0"" ladies hop on the M-1 and transform into total badasses (5'0"" men do the same).  The M-1 is light enough to be comfortably managed by a smaller person.  We suggest riders are at least 4'11"" to ride. 
Is this M-1 model the same for men and women?
It sure is.  Women and men love the M-1 equally and every test rider comes back with a grin that just won't quit.  
Is there a weight limit?
The M-1 accommodates 2 riders or up to 350lbs.  Passenger pegs are sold separately through our website.
What about theft?
There is no substitute for good judgment, and that includes where you lock your  M-1.  Nothing is theft-proof but we can slow thieves down.  First, the M-1 is keyless and password protected.  Only you and authorized users can start your M-1.  When locking outside, we recommend a 9"" U-lock that you can buy at any bicycle shop, hardware store, or online.  Simply lock your M-1 to a bicycle rack as you would a regular bicycle, and your M-1 should be right where you left it when you return.
Can I customize my bike?Not quite yet.  Currently, the M-1 Bolt Motorbike is available in Classic Black, but we're working on other color schemes and aftermarket upgrades including passenger pegs, storage and basket options, extra batteries, and more.  Everything not listed here will be available through our website, so stay tuned.  If you have specific requests or cool ideas, please contact us directly...we wanna hear from you!

<h1><strong>What's a TriTrack?</strong></h1>
<p>The patented dual mode TriTrack is a 4-passenger electric car with plenty of cargo space which can be driven both on the ground and on an elevated monorail. Its speed on the ground is up to 70 mph. On the monorail TriTrack travels at a breathtaking 180 mph. It fits the legal description of a 3-wheel motorcycle in all 50 states, so it can be driven on the road like any other vehicle. In some states the TriTrack can also be recognized as a Neighborhood Electric Vehicle (NEV) with a software change. </p>
<p>TriTrack is introducing structural composite system: light-weight, impact resistant, cost reducing and efficient. It uses our structural composites technology to redefine what you expect from a car. We would love to claim TriTrack is the first car with a composite body, but we would upset a lot of European exotic car makers. </p>
<p>What we can say is that we are the first to bring this ground-breaking technology to the masses. Unlike the uber exotics, we don't use high-cost raw materials. Our processes allow us to utilize materials that are more readily available (thus less expensive) while still delivering incredible strength and light weight characteristics.</p>
<p>When you're in a TriTrack and a half-million-dollar supercar pulls alongside, you'll know your car is sporting the same advanced technology without the advanced price tag. Gloating is permissible.</p>

<h2><strong>How Does it Work?</strong></h2>
<p>On the ground, the TriTrack is powered by a battery mule stored underside of the car. When it gets on the monorail, the battery mule drops out of the TriTrack and a linear motor built into the monorail accelerates the car to cruising speed. A smaller battery inside the car maintains its speed on the monorail  and a linear generator recaptures the car's energy as it comes down off the rail. When the car reaches the ground again, it picks up a different, fully charged battery mule and continues to its final destination.</p>

<h1><strong>Who are you?</strong></h1>
<p>MaglevTrans is a team of like-minded people driven by the desire to revolutionize the transport industry and make our world better - a much cleaner and safer place to live in. The electric car is the step in the right direction, but it does not solve traffic problems, so we designed the solution for the transportation industry using Magnetic Levitation technology and <strong>TriTrack is the first part of this solution</strong>.</p>
<p>TriTrack is one of 19 patented ideas that Jerry Roane registered. Jerry has been involved in start-up companies since college.  Many of the projects that he has worked on have made it to the mainstream. The transmission that is like the one in the Toyota Prius that accounts for the high mileage on the highway was his first start-up out of college.  The continuously variable transmission with computer control was 25 years ahead of its time. The computerized credit card that is built into our American Express card was built first in the US by the factory that Jerry managed the construction of as a manufacturing engineering manager.  Jerry designed electronic packaging for the world’s thinnest production heart pacemaker of its time - the 8mm Quantum pacemaker. Now Jerry joined forces with the team from MagLevTrans and we are very close to finalizing creation of the new mode of transportation. <strong>Be part of this revolution in transportation.</strong></p>

<p>With your support, we can bring TriTrack into all cities worldwide. While we're close to entering production (we have got quotes for all components and ready to start), your contribution will help fund the completion of the prototype, do extensive testing and fine tuning. Following that we can start production tooling and the first production batch. Ultimately we want to establish a full highly automated production facility in the US to build TriTrack for every family.</p>
<h1><strong>Why Are You Doing a Indiegogo?</strong></h1>
<p>A few reasons.  First and foremost, we want to build a community around this project. We think Indiegogo is a great way to find interested people, to gather support and to get feedback.  </p>
<p>We also want help from the community in bringing the price of TriTrack as low as possible - to be the cheapest car you can find on the US market. We can only achieve that by creating tooling for mass production after vigorous testing of initial prototype vehicles.</p>

<p>We have invested a lot of our personal money and have serious investors who are prepared to invest. However, when you are as passionate about your ideals as you are about your product, finding investors who share the whole vision (not just the profits) can be tricky. When we started talking about Indiegogo, we were motivated and excited by the spirit of the community. We want to create vehicles that make the world better for everyone, from the rider whose time is very precious, to the worker who gets a new job building something sustainable, to the city dwellers who breathe a little easier with less pollution in the air. We feel that since getting these vehicles out in the world can have such a big impact on everyone, why not give everyone the opportunity to support the idea and help make it happen. We want to make these vehicles affordable and accessible for all people around the world, starting from US, and funding the first TriTrack through Indiegogo will help us achieve that goal.</p>
<p>By launching this project through Indiegogo, we hope we can get a head-start on all of these things. TriTrack has a lot to offer mankind in energy savings, cleaner air and time given back to families each day.</p>
<h1><strong>We Know We Can Do This! </strong></h1>

<h1>Ideas behind TriTrack – Safety, Convenience, Efficiency</h1>
<p><strong>Safety</strong> has been one of the top priorities while developing the TriTrack. The TriTrack car is very lightweight. Unloaded and without the battery mule, it will weigh approximately 300 lbs. Fully loaded and on the ground it will still be weigh less than 1,500 lbs. What this means for safety is that if you hit a pedestrian or other car, the likelihood of injuring them is greatly reduced. The reason why we can keep the TriTrack so lightweight compared to traditional cars is that it is built like an airplane. The strength of the structure is in the outer honeycomb shell rather than in a heavy steel frame. New technologies are worthless if they don't protect what’s most important. That's why safety is the most important part of the efficient vehicle design. Our impact resistant composite safety cage, which acts like a cocoon around passengers, is at the core of every TriTrack. Additionally, TriTrack composites are strong and tough, so they are less likely to crush during impact. In fact, our composites distribute the force across the body instead of bending like steel during an accident.</p>
<p><strong>Convenience</strong> is another major priority for the TriTrack. It is all well and good to design an extremely safe car, but if it is too impractical or inconvenient, then nobody will drive it and it doesn't help anything. The problem with current (even electric) cars is that they have to share the same road. Nobody likes sitting in traffic, and who wants to add time to their daily commute? When on the monorail, the TriTrack can move at a much faster pace. Ideally, from anywhere in the city, you will be no more than a half mile from the nearest monorail ramp. This ensures that the majority of your travel is on the high-speed monorail and you're not stuck in traffic on the ground. Another inconvenience is having to stop to re-fuel or recharge. This is a major drawback of most clean-powered cars available today because it limits the cars' range. Because the distance a TriTrack travels on the ground is relatively short and because you always pick up a fresh battery mule when you get off the monorail or make a turn inthe city-wide grid, you have through logistics infinite range within the network and never have to stop to re-fuel. The smaller battery that is used to maintain speed on the monorail is quickly charged on the fly by the battery mule, so you don't have to stop to recharge it either. When a car is designed to hold a full day's (or week's) worth of power, it requires an incredibly large and expensive battery pack. The car's structure then must be stronger to support it, and thus heavier. A heavy car is not as energy efficient when it comes to moving people, and so range and performance are dropped, and it costs much more to replace the batteries. Due to recent developments in electric batteries we were able to design TriTrack with travelling distance of up to 205 miles, which is sufficient to travel anywhere in the city even without monorail. Thanks to installation of nation wide network of supercharging rolling swap stations (Patents 6,9239124 -- 7,127,999 -- 7,334,524) soon you will be able to travel across the states like in traditional gasoline car.</p>

<p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Finally, the solution has to be efficient and feasible. It is very important for the transportation revolution to happen as soon as possible. We've been promised flying cars and non-polluting vehicles for such a long time that people don't really believe it anymore. Everybody agrees that air pollution is a major problem, that traffic keeps getting worse, and that fossil fuels won't last much longer or still remain affordable. A car that can solve these problems and more sounds like a dream solution. Help make it a reality with TriTrack. </p>
<p><strong><em>The TriTrack dual mode, ultra-light, high-speed, monorail electric car will revolutionize both personal and shipping transportation. Be part of it by providing your support.</em></strong></p></span></div>","Dual mode TriTrack is a 4-passenger EV with 5 cents per mile energy cost. It can be driven on the ground up to 70 mph and on an elevated monorail at 180 mph.




Do you hate wasting your precious time in traffic? 
Are you tired of spending money filling up your gas tank every week? 
Do you feel guilt over your personal contribution to climate change every time you get in your car?
Do you want to revolutionize personal transportation?
Do you want to end transport dependency on oil?

 
We have a solution: take Airplane Aerodynamics and Lightweight Design, add Moving repulsive magnetic fields and throw in advances in the Electric Battery logistics and you get the TriTrack - the cleanest, safest and most efficient vehicle on the planet. We also decided to make it Very Affordable, so your family can own one without any financial stress. Our reason for starting this project is simple: there is no low-cost electrical vehicle on the market that can change the way we move, dramatically saving lives, time, money, energy and making our planet cleaner.

 

What's a TriTrack?
The patented dual mode TriTrack is a 4-passenger electric car with plenty of cargo space which can be driven both on the ground and on an elevated monorail. Its speed on the ground is up to 70 mph. On the monorail TriTrack travels at a breathtaking 180 mph. It fits the legal description of a 3-wheel motorcycle in all 50 states, so it can be driven on the road like any other vehicle. In some states the TriTrack can also be recognized as a Neighborhood Electric Vehicle (NEV) with a software change. 
TriTrack is introducing structural composite system: light-weight, impact resistant, cost reducing and efficient. It uses our structural composites technology to redefine what you expect from a car. We would love to claim TriTrack is the first car with a composite body, but we would upset a lot of European exotic car makers. 
What we can say is that we are the first to bring this ground-breaking technology to the masses. Unlike the uber exotics, we don't use high-cost raw materials. Our processes allow us to utilize materials that are more readily available (thus less expensive) while still delivering incredible strength and light weight characteristics.
When you're in a TriTrack and a half-million-dollar supercar pulls alongside, you'll know your car is sporting the same advanced technology without the advanced price tag. Gloating is permissible.
 


The specs

Power Source

Solar panels installed on the TriTrack custom kit built garage and the monorail
Battery mule - 10 hp electric motor to drive on the road 
Vehicle - 80.5 hp electric motor to drive on the monorail
Up-ramp - 230 hp linear motor with magnetic linkage to the car to accelerate on the monorail
Down-ramp - 230 hp linear generator with magnetic linkage to the car to recover energy getting off the monorail
18.7kWh mule lithium iron phosphate battery per mule

Body/Frame

Windshield  - Lexan TM (the same as private jets windshields) 
Body - Honeycomb sandwich monocoque (the same as used for an airplane body) 
LED lighting including headlights, brake lights, markers, cabin, map and turn signals
Alloy wheels front and rear option
Dynamic brakes rear and disk brakes front wheels
Curb weight street version 1,300 lbs
Storage compartment with room for 5 suitcases - 125lbs cargo


Performance

180 mph (290 km/h) on the monorail
70 mph (112 km/h) on the road
205 miles (330km) range at hgighway speed with each battery mule (we will increase that by optimizing the battery manufacturing process)

 
How Does it Work?
On the ground, the TriTrack is powered by a battery mule stored underside of the car. When it gets on the monorail, the battery mule drops out of the TriTrack and a linear motor built into the monorail accelerates the car to cruising speed. A smaller battery inside the car maintains its speed on the monorail  and a linear generator recaptures the car's energy as it comes down off the rail. When the car reaches the ground again, it picks up a different, fully charged battery mule and continues to its final destination.

Who are you?
MaglevTrans is a team of like-minded people driven by the desire to revolutionize the transport industry and make our world better - a much cleaner and safer place to live in. The electric car is the step in the right direction, but it does not solve traffic problems, so we designed the solution for the transportation industry using Magnetic Levitation technology and TriTrack is the first part of this solution.
TriTrack is one of 19 patented ideas that Jerry Roane registered. Jerry has been involved in start-up companies since college.  Many of the projects that he has worked on have made it to the mainstream. The transmission that is like the one in the Toyota Prius that accounts for the high mileage on the highway was his first start-up out of college.  The continuously variable transmission with computer control was 25 years ahead of its time. The computerized credit card that is built into our American Express card was built first in the US by the factory that Jerry managed the construction of as a manufacturing engineering manager.  Jerry designed electronic packaging for the world’s thinnest production heart pacemaker of its time - the 8mm Quantum pacemaker. Now Jerry joined forces with the team from MagLevTrans and we are very close to finalizing creation of the new mode of transportation. Be part of this revolution in transportation.
 
Where we're at
We have a full engineering design completed, did testing in the University of Texas Wind Tunnel:

We then started building the first TriTrack. The picture you see below is a mold of the body shell of the first TriTrack.

We also ordered a lot of parts for the first 50 vehicles:



With your support, we can bring TriTrack into all cities worldwide. While we're close to entering production (we have got quotes for all components and ready to start), your contribution will help fund the completion of the prototype, do extensive testing and fine tuning. Following that we can start production tooling and the first production batch. Ultimately we want to establish a full highly automated production facility in the US to build TriTrack for every family.
Why Are You Doing a Indiegogo?
A few reasons.  First and foremost, we want to build a community around this project. We think Indiegogo is a great way to find interested people, to gather support and to get feedback.  
We also want help from the community in bringing the price of TriTrack as low as possible - to be the cheapest car you can find on the US market. We can only achieve that by creating tooling for mass production after vigorous testing of initial prototype vehicles.

<p><strong>Amarok Racing</strong> was founded by partners <strong>Michael Uhlarik</strong> and <strong>Kevin O'Neil</strong> in the winter of 2010 with the aim of designing &amp; building the lightest, best handling high performance electric racing motorcycle possible, to challenge existing electric motorcycle limitations. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""cover"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/822959/pictures/full/20130521122826-AMAROK_INDIEGOGO_COVER.jpg?1369164512"" src="""" style="""" title=""cover""/> </p>
<p>Using our combined 40+ years of experience as professionals in vehicle development, we started with a clean sheet design that grew around the largest and most limiting part of the motorcycle : the batteries.  From there, inspired by our passion for aeospace design and Canadian design icons like the <strong>AVRO Arrow</strong>, we constructed an all aluminum, stressed-skin monocoque that radically reduced weight, added stiffness and balanced the motorcycle like the very best gasoline powered bikes today.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""PPIHC"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/822969/pictures/full/20130521123008-PPIHC_START.jpg?1369164611"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p><strong>The Mission</strong></p>
<p>The real test starts with our unprecedented entry in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb race, near Boulder Colorado this June 24 - 30th.  This is the second oldest motor race in the United States and a brutal 156 turn, 10,000 foot ascent up Pikes Peak, that tests the resolve of professional drivers and that pushes the performance the endurance limits of vehicles.  </p>
<p>The electric motorcycle record up the hill stands at just under 13 minutes, a feat that was done on a big gasoline-powered Suzuki that had been modified with electric power but as a consequence weighed over 250kgs!  </p>
<p>Our <strong>Amarok P1A weighs almost half that</strong>, and was designed without compromise to be electric from the start.  Together with trusted partner and advisor Greg Tracy, a man who has won the race 6 times on a motorcycle, we plan to beat that time and set a new record for an electric motorcycle.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Challenge </strong></p>
<p><img alt=""van"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/822971/pictures/full/20130521123049-TRAVEL.jpg?1369164653"" src="""" style="""" title=""van""/> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are an entirely self-funded team made up of motorcycle industry pros, but this isn't our day job.  Based in Altantic Canada means that our race will take us nearly <em>7000 kms round trip</em>.  Thats a lot of gas for our van (pictured above), roadside food and some lodging (we can't sleep in the van every night without risking our partnership).  </p>
<p>Money raised will offset the cost of transportation of the motorcycle, spare parts, tools and crew, plus airfare and accomodations for our racer and development rider from Toronto and Atlantic Canada to Colorado and back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- gas for van ($1400)</p>
<p>- return arifare for racer ($800)</p>
<p>- return airfare for videographer ($800)</p>
<p>- accomodations for team of 5 x 10 days ($2400)</p>
<p>- food for team ($1200)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Extra funds will go towards manufacturing lighter parts for the bike, that will further increase our chances of success on the mountain.  </p>
<p>We need your support to help fund our attempt, the first for any Canadian built motorcycle, to get to Pikes Peak and proove <strong>Why Less is More</strong>.</p>

<p>Amarok Racing believes in the power of hand craftsmanship and human experience to overcome limited resources.  Thats how we designed an electric motorcycle with the same power-to-weight-ratio of leading gasoline-powered 600cc supersport bikes without resorting to exotic materials and without hundreds of thousands of dollars in development budget.</p>

<p>Supporters of Amarok Racing will be up close and personal as we continue to document our project with live updates, a special event video and opening our doors and desk drawers so that you can see how we make this happen.  </p>
<p>We aim to punch above our weight, literally and figuratively.  In the months since we announced our intentions Amarok has garnered tons of media attention all across the racing and alternative energy world, and going ahead we expect to validate our concept of lightweight efficiency.</p>

<p>Amarok Racing is international award winning motorcycle designer Michael Uhlarik, and life-long motor racing mechanical design technician Kevin O'Neil.  Together with a dozen or so close friends, colleagues and supporters, we have made this ground-up project happen, from idea to track test in two and half years.</p>
<p>Michael has cut his teeth as a senior designer for Yamaha Motor in Europe and Japan, penning machines like the MT-03, TZR and 2003 M1 MotoGP.  He has also worked for Aprilia, Derbi, Bombardier and others.  He teaches design at the Nova Scotia College of Art and writes about the motorcycle industry for Hell For Leather and Cycle Canada magazines.</p>
<p>Kevin has been mad about Formula One and motorcycles since his teen years, owned and wrenched a March 71B formula race car, worked as a Norton, Laverda and Ducati mechanic, built kit airplanes and designed and manufactured just about every mechanical part found on performance motor vehicles, including the P1, for the better part of three decades.  What Kevin can do with a lathe and hand tools has to be seen to be believed. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Amarok Racing is entirely self-funded.  We are raising corporate sponsorship and have been supported by <strong>AGNI Motor</strong>, <strong>Dunlop</strong> tire, <strong>Pro 6 Cycle</strong>, <strong>iamphoto</strong> media, <strong>CZ Carrozzeria</strong>, as well as a small army of supporters.  We expect to secure a title sponsor soon to compete in TTXGP / E-Power world championship events, but Pikes Peak is going to be all on us.</p>
<p>Going forward Amarok wants to keep developing the P1 concept so that we can race full time in 2014 and eventually bring our lightweight electric performance motorcycles to market for you to enjoy.</p>

<p>Team Amarok Racing</p>
</div></div>","Amarok Racing was founded by partners Michael Uhlarik and Kevin O'Neil in the winter of 2010 with the aim of designing & building the lightest, best handling high performance electric racing motorcycle possible, to challenge existing electric motorcycle limitations. 
 
 
Using our combined 40+ years of experience as professionals in vehicle development, we started with a clean sheet design that grew around the largest and most limiting part of the motorcycle : the batteries.  From there, inspired by our passion for aeospace design and Canadian design icons like the AVRO Arrow, we constructed an all aluminum, stressed-skin monocoque that radically reduced weight, added stiffness and balanced the motorcycle like the very best gasoline powered bikes today.
 
 
The Mission
The real test starts with our unprecedented entry in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb race, near Boulder Colorado this June 24 - 30th.  This is the second oldest motor race in the United States and a brutal 156 turn, 10,000 foot ascent up Pikes Peak, that tests the resolve of professional drivers and that pushes the performance the endurance limits of vehicles.  
The electric motorcycle record up the hill stands at just under 13 minutes, a feat that was done on a big gasoline-powered Suzuki that had been modified with electric power but as a consequence weighed over 250kgs!  
Our Amarok P1A weighs almost half that, and was designed without compromise to be electric from the start.  Together with trusted partner and advisor Greg Tracy, a man who has won the race 6 times on a motorcycle, we plan to beat that time and set a new record for an electric motorcycle.  
 
Our Challenge 
 
 
We are an entirely self-funded team made up of motorcycle industry pros, but this isn't our day job.  Based in Altantic Canada means that our race will take us nearly 7000 kms round trip.  Thats a lot of gas for our van (pictured above), roadside food and some lodging (we can't sleep in the van every night without risking our partnership).  
Money raised will offset the cost of transportation of the motorcycle, spare parts, tools and crew, plus airfare and accomodations for our racer and development rider from Toronto and Atlantic Canada to Colorado and back.
 
- gas for van ($1400)
- return arifare for racer ($800)
- return airfare for videographer ($800)
- accomodations for team of 5 x 10 days ($2400)
- food for team ($1200)
 
Extra funds will go towards manufacturing lighter parts for the bike, that will further increase our chances of success on the mountain.  
We need your support to help fund our attempt, the first for any Canadian built motorcycle, to get to Pikes Peak and proove Why Less is More.
 




 
 
Amarok Racing believes in the power of hand craftsmanship and human experience to overcome limited resources.  Thats how we designed an electric motorcycle with the same power-to-weight-ratio of leading gasoline-powered 600cc supersport bikes without resorting to exotic materials and without hundreds of thousands of dollars in development budget.
 

 
Supporters of Amarok Racing will be up close and personal as we continue to document our project with live updates, a special event video and opening our doors and desk drawers so that you can see how we make this happen.  
We aim to punch above our weight, literally and figuratively.  In the months since we announced our intentions Amarok has garnered tons of media attention all across the racing and alternative energy world, and going ahead we expect to validate our concept of lightweight efficiency.


Amarok Racing is international award winning motorcycle designer Michael Uhlarik, and life-long motor racing mechanical design technician Kevin O'Neil.  Together with a dozen or so close friends, colleagues and supporters, we have made this ground-up project happen, from idea to track test in two and half years.
Michael has cut his teeth as a senior designer for Yamaha Motor in Europe and Japan, penning machines like the MT-03, TZR and 2003 M1 MotoGP.  He has also worked for Aprilia, Derbi, Bombardier and others.  He teaches design at the Nova Scotia College of Art and writes about the motorcycle industry for Hell For Leather and Cycle Canada magazines.
Kevin has been mad about Formula One and motorcycles since his teen years, owned and wrenched a March 71B formula race car, worked as a Norton, Laverda and Ducati mechanic, built kit airplanes and designed and manufactured just about every mechanical part found on performance motor vehicles, including the P1, for the better part of three decades.  What Kevin can do with a lathe and hand tools has to be seen to be believed. 
 

Perks
Amarok swag, limited edition poster prints, original artwork, trackdays with us and corporate team sponsorship are all on the table.  We want to show you that we apprecitate you help, your support and your enthusiasm by offering value as well as excitement.  Our new clothing is being made in Halifax by local people so we can ensure quality and reliable delivery.
 
 


 
The Impact
Amarok Racing is entirely self-funded.  We are raising corporate sponsorship and have been supported by AGNI Motor, Dunlop tire, Pro 6 Cycle, iamphoto media, CZ Carrozzeria, as well as a small army of supporters.  We expect to secure a title sponsor soon to compete in TTXGP / E-Power world championship events, but Pikes Peak is going to be all on us.
Going forward Amarok wants to keep developing the P1 concept so that we can race full time in 2014 and eventually bring our lightweight electric performance motorcycles to market for you to enjoy.

most successful recycling program. <br/></p><p> Although not nearly as recyclable as the AGM cells, the Lithium Cells (Lithium Iron Phosphate) used in the Fusion have the highest recycle-ability rating versus other lithium chemistries. The Fusion is constructed of more than  80% T6061 forged aluminum alloy. This has three benefits; Light weight, durable, and recyclable. </p><h2><br/></h2><h2>    DOT Approved and Non-Hazardous</h2><p>       The
 advantage of the sealed valve regulated AGM design is that the battery 
needs no water,  there is no free acid to leak or spill, they can be 
operated in any position, and can be used in close proximity to people 
and sensitive equipment. They are used in toys, medical equipment, 
mobility equipment, security, industrial equipment, consumer devices, 
and many other applications because of these features. The sealed 
batteries AGM were originally designed for the US air force and are DOT 
approved for air transport, and deemed non-hazardous. This makes them 
suitable for shipping around the world without hassles. It also allows
 travelers flexibility to carry them in E-bikes, mobility chairs and 
scooters abroad. </p><p><br/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><br/></h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Long Beach, CA,  Prototype ride by ElectricRideReview.com</h3><p><br/></p><p>*Note this was a prototype version of the Fusion.

criteria for electric bikes (1000 watt).  As long as you wear a helmet 
there is no license or insurance required      The Fusion electric bike will not only provide a reliable and economical means of transportation, Its also thrilling and high-tech. Packed with technology that other bikes just don't offer. Regenerative braking, disk brake, large LCD display, and a full suspension really set the Fusion apart in its price class. 
New Perks Added!Fusion 2000 watt conversion kit  Extra Batteries for AGM and Lithium  Heavy Duty Thick tubesIntegrated lighting system 25 watts      The power comes from a controller designed and tuned by Cutler cycles to be extremely reliable and powerful. The  48V MOSFET  controller that delivers up to a peak of 2000 watts of power*.The Fusions controller can also be tailored to adhere to any local laws international or domestic(250watt, 350watt laws ) The power level can be set on the LCD dashboard  and adjusted for off-road use back to maximum power. 
                 *1000 watt nominal controller. 40A Peak= 2000watt



The Difference is Power2000-2500 watts to be exact. When it comes to ebikes power equals acceleration, its as simple as that. What other bikes in this price class are lacking is the torque and acceleration that you need to get in and out of city traffic or that extra push when you need to accelerate quickly. .Brushless Gearless Direct-drive electric motors offer a greater than 7 year life expectancy and regenerative braking!No
 gears to replace every few years! Like lots of other popular bikes. The
 Fusion electric bike requires no motor maintenance! for its life time.The Fusion is delivered 95% assembled and can be up in running in minutes!Take a ride with me on the Fusion Electric Bike!.Race onboard with 3 Fusion ebikes!
Watch the Front suspension in action in this quick lap around Legg lake in California.
 Rear suspension Feels like floating on a cushion especially at high speeds or bumpy terrain.Go where other bikes ebikes can't!!!  Come take a ride with the Fusion Electric Bike                                 El Monte, CA,  
Motorcycle inspired design      We wanted to place the 
battery cells so that the center of gravity would be at its best. Long term battery solutions should be protected and mounted with vibration dampening. We 
packed in some of the most powerful cells available.  The Fusion is  able to achieve average ranges between 30-70 miles at cruise speeds at 
up to 30 mph with efficiency greater than 85%       The Fusion electric bike 
is designed more like a very light motorcycle than your average short 
range slow speed E-bike. Its a different breed! This provides a whole new level of battery protection unlike most other bikes which when tipped or dropped can damage the battery. The Fusion's batteries are mounted inside a very light weight T6061 forged aluminum fairing.9 cents is all  it cost to recharge the Fusion.Battery SchoolThe Fusion's Batteries


LiFePo4
The Fusion uses Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFep04) Lithium cells. This type of chemistry differs in 3 ways.  This provides high output power 40Amps,  and can last over 2000+ recharges. 



*At an average of 20 miles per charge that would equate to 40,000+miles.






AGM 

batteries are an untapped resource for high power long range electric bikes



 High recharge effciency and high power output combined with the reliability of over 500 recharges. 
Check out Court Ryes Brief on EBR. The differences between AGM and Lithium Batteries.
Charge Controller ensures proper battery life and performanceAll components can be registered for warranty1 Year- Controller/computer, LCD screen and all  Battery packs2 Year- 1000 Watt 40Amp direct drive hub motor5 Year- Forged aluminum frame      The Fusion is Practically 100% Recyclable              We created the 
Fusion around the 6-DZM-12 batteries which were developed for use in commercial consumer products. They are made from recycled materials and AGM batteries have the worlds 
most successful recycling program.  Although not nearly as recyclable as the AGM cells, the Lithium Cells (Lithium Iron Phosphate) used in the Fusion have the highest recycle-ability rating versus other lithium chemistries. The Fusion is constructed of more than  80% T6061 forged aluminum alloy. This has three benefits; Light weight, durable, and recyclable.     DOT Approved and Non-Hazardous       The
 advantage of the sealed valve regulated AGM design is that the battery 
needs no water,  there is no free acid to leak or spill, they can be 
operated in any position, and can be used in close proximity to people 
and sensitive equipment. They are used in toys, medical equipment, 
mobility equipment, security, industrial equipment, consumer devices, 
and many other applications because of these features. The sealed 
batteries AGM were originally designed for the US air force and are DOT 
approved for air transport, and deemed non-hazardous. This makes them 
suitable for shipping around the world without hassles. It also allows
 travelers flexibility to carry them in E-bikes, mobility chairs and 
scooters abroad. Long Beach, CA,  Prototype ride by ElectricRideReview.com*Note this was a prototype version of the Fusion. The bike has been significantly upgraded

Update:
Even though we probably won't reach our goal of $10,000, all of the contributions will still be used for some of the materials; the prototype will still be constructed, albeit later than planned. I would like to Thank Everyone who has shared, liked, commented and donated towards this campaign!
 
What the Magnetic Battery is:
Following in the footsteps of Tesla, Maxwell, Farraday & Crookes, I've used concepts from electrodynamics, chemistry, magnetism and physics to devise a modified electrodynamic generator that accepts Alternating Current (AC) electricity to be converted into an electromagnetic field. Circulating without resistance (heat) and stored in-phase, the magnetic flux acts as both a seal between the surrounding alloys (preventing damage to circuitry) and as a plentiful power source.
Why this Should be made
Modern electrolyte batteries store a nominal voltage & current, which is not sufficient for renewable energy sources, electric vehicles or makeshift shelters.
Imagine a modern electric car for example: Current battery banks consist of dozens of large (and low amp) 12volt batteries; this device could fit into a socket, emit electricity and not release any hazardous materials or radiation. It could store more than 700 times the amount of energy than the 12v battery alternative.
The design can be scaled to mostly any size, with exponential storage ability.Besides, longer-life batteries means less toxic material in landfills, and less chemical pollutants from manufacturers!If you take the effects a step further, you'll see how this concept affects everyone. Gasoline has a dominant role in creating Greenhouse emissions from hydrocarbons (which are warming the atmosphere); if your substitute the combustion engine/drive-shaft for batteries & DC motors, you're actually saving money.
How it will be made
The exoskeleton (chassis) will be made of a soft iron alloy to prevent EMR (electromagnetic radiation) from being emitted under unwanted circumstances and nullifying any energy that is stored.
Modern batteries function on closed-circuits, which nullifies the current when not attached to a load (outside of air conductivity). In order to maintain the magnetic field though, the current is required to be constantly moving. One circuit I invented is a trans-connection circuit (TCC); self-generating the current by mechanical means, inside a closed system.If I was using DC power, the magnetic fields generated by the flow of current wouldn't move (unlike AC) due to constant voltage; however I need shifting waves working in conjunction with each other to amplify the signal.
There are few ways to convert the primary energy source from electromagnetism --> electricity. The most common way is by moving a piece of metal, like Iron, alternating past the face of a coil, cutting off the field lines.
What are the materials needed?
The materials that I need are mainly transition elements and alloys that I will need to melt & forge myself. Most are inexpensive, but one compound in particular is rare in its' purest form. Pretty much all types of circuitry components are needed (and will be sealed from EMR - except basic coils & some non-logical circuits).
I will also need to purchase several pounds of graphite to form the mold of the chassis, and upgrade some equipment to assemble the components.

It looks to show how it can be improved while ensuring the most current pressing transport-related challenges including traffic congestion and accidents, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and transportation inequity are addressed.<br/><br/>My name is Galo Bowen and I am the author of <i>Mobility 2040: Re-engineering the Fragmented US Transportation System to Drive Mobility for All</i>. I wrote this book because I see a huge potential for a very fragmented US transportation system to be re-engineered in the coming years to effectively drive seamless and sustainable mobility for all people.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a more holistic vision of how the US transportation system can be re-engineered and re-imagined. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn about US transportation system related challenges, discover new and emerging technology trends in mobility, and become an advocate for improving access to mobility for all.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are a commuter, an investor, a current employee of a mobility and technology company or public transportation agency, a politician, or just someone interested in improving transportation in the United States.<br/><br/><i>Mobility 2040</i> speaks to transportation and mobility companies, public transit agencies, and government officials who want to grapple with transport-related challenges and mobility trends in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Mobility 2040</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><ul>
<li>How can current existing mobility trends be leveraged to fix the US transportation system?</li>
<li>How can public-private transport partnerships and ecosystem help empower mobility in the US?</li>
<li>How can we ensure a sustainable and inclusive US transportation system that drives mobility for all people?</li>
</ul><p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing mobility trends, public-private transport partnership and ecosystem, transportation sustainability and inequity will change us all for the better.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>The Book - <i>Mobility 2040</i></strong></h3><p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains chapters 1-3. This part explains how we got here — it covers the modern history of the US transportation system and all the transport-related challenges of today. I explain why I am yet hopeful that such a broken system can be re-engineered over the next few decades. In this part I discuss how data and software companies including StreetLight Data and INRIX Inc. are leveraging emerging technologies like Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to drive effective and efficient transportation planning.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 4-8. This part explains how five distinct mobility trends are empowering mobility. It covers electric vehicles (EVs), Mobility as a Service (MaaS), autonomous vehicles (AVs), micromobility and microtransit. It includes the story of former ride-hailing company Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, and how the firm made it through the ride-sharing space upon recognizing the need to reduce costs and their carbon footprint. It also includes the story of Travis VanderZandern — CEO and Founder of electric scooter rental company Bird — and his motivation to work on last mile dockless electric transportation upon leaving his job at Uber.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 </strong>contains chapters 9-11. This part discusses in detail the concept of MaaS, its origins in Europe and its gradual penetration in the US. It describes how the future of the US transportation system could look over the next decades with a MaaS implemented system enabled by the autonomy and electrification of vehicles. It includes the story of Sampo Hietanen, known as “the father of MaaS”, and CEO and founder of MaaS company MaaS Global and its “Whim” mobility app. It explains the business case and purpose of MaaS, consisting of a movement away from personally owned vehicles towards mobility solutions provided by a combination of public and private organizations. It also includes the story of founder and head of MaaS America Tim McGuckin, and differences between MaaS in Europe versus MaaS in the US, and the need for the public and private sectors to work together for a successful deployment of MaaS.<br/> </p><h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607109890/wfqz8lfrrrnhanlefghr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>And our next goal is:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607109755/flolkmdjnz16u9uakpxa.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>And this is where things get even MORE exciting...</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607109582/sq4sfnnmctd98oi78ikf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

It looks to show how it can be improved while ensuring the most current pressing transport-related challenges including traffic congestion and accidents, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and transportation inequity are addressed.My name is Galo Bowen and I am the author of Mobility 2040: Re-engineering the Fragmented US Transportation System to Drive Mobility for All. I wrote this book because I see a huge potential for a very fragmented US transportation system to be re-engineered in the coming years to effectively drive seamless and sustainable mobility for all people.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a more holistic vision of how the US transportation system can be re-engineered and re-imagined. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn about US transportation system related challenges, discover new and emerging technology trends in mobility, and become an advocate for improving access to mobility for all.You will love this book if you are a commuter, an investor, a current employee of a mobility and technology company or public transportation agency, a politician, or just someone interested in improving transportation in the United States.Mobility 2040 speaks to transportation and mobility companies, public transit agencies, and government officials who want to grapple with transport-related challenges and mobility trends in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that Mobility 2040 inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:
How can current existing mobility trends be leveraged to fix the US transportation system?
How can public-private transport partnerships and ecosystem help empower mobility in the US?
How can we ensure a sustainable and inclusive US transportation system that drives mobility for all people?
I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing mobility trends, public-private transport partnership and ecosystem, transportation sustainability and inequity will change us all for the better. The Book - Mobility 2040The book is written in 3 parts.Part 1 contains chapters 1-3. This part explains how we got here — it covers the modern history of the US transportation system and all the transport-related challenges of today. I explain why I am yet hopeful that such a broken system can be re-engineered over the next few decades. In this part I discuss how data and software companies including StreetLight Data and INRIX Inc. are leveraging emerging technologies like Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to drive effective and efficient transportation planning.Part 2 contains chapters 4-8. This part explains how five distinct mobility trends are empowering mobility. It covers electric vehicles (EVs), Mobility as a Service (MaaS), autonomous vehicles (AVs), micromobility and microtransit. It includes the story of former ride-hailing company Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, and how the firm made it through the ride-sharing space upon recognizing the need to reduce costs and their carbon footprint. It also includes the story of Travis VanderZandern — CEO and Founder of electric scooter rental company Bird — and his motivation to work on last mile dockless electric transportation upon leaving his job at Uber.Part 3 contains chapters 9-11. This part discusses in detail the concept of MaaS, its origins in Europe and its gradual penetration in the US. It describes how the future of the US transportation system could look over the next decades with a MaaS implemented system enabled by the autonomy and electrification of vehicles. It includes the story of Sampo Hietanen, known as “the father of MaaS”, and CEO and founder of MaaS company MaaS Global and its “Whim” mobility app. It explains the business case and purpose of MaaS, consisting of a movement away from personally owned vehicles towards mobility solutions provided by a combination of public and private organizations. It also includes the story of founder and head of MaaS America Tim McGuckin, and differences between MaaS in Europe versus MaaS in the US, and the need for the public and private sectors to work together for a successful deployment of MaaS. What I Need & What You'll GetAnd our next goal is:And this is where things get even MORE exciting...This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:
The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April, 2021.
The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)
The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring.
I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

</h1>
<p>The single greatest factor that goes into the decision to drink and drive is the low risk of getting caught<sup>[1]</sup>. Increase the risk of getting caught and you decrease impaired driving. RTV is building predictive software that identifies vehicles that are at the highest risk of being used by habitual drunk drivers, even when those drivers have never previously been charged for impaired driving. Using this intelligence, Police can take action that significantly increases the risk of getting caught.</p>
<p>There is a misconception that impaired driving rates are declining. The reality is that the total number of motor vehicle deaths has declined for <strong>both</strong> alcohol and non-alcohol related deaths; however, the <strong>ratio </strong>of deaths involving alcohol is trending upwards.</p>
<p>Over one-third of fatal car crashes in North America involve alcohol. More than 10,000 people die in alcohol related accidents in North America every year<sup>[2]</sup>. Hundreds of thousands more are injured, costing society over $70 billion annually<sup>[3]</sup>.</p>
<h3><strong>There is a very small group of prolific, habitual drunk drivers that are virtually unknown to police.</strong></h3>
<p><img alt=""3% are responsible for 86% of all driving trips"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://rtvgroup.ca/indiegogo/3-86percent.png"" src="""" style=""font-size: 10px;""/></p>

<p>It is a very small group of habitual drunk drivers that are responsible for most impaired driving trips. Less than 3% of licensed drivers are responsible for 86% of all impaired driving trips. Sadly, this small group of drunk drivers offend more frequently and with higher levels of alcohol in their system. Typically, habitual drunk drivers will offend between 80 and 2,000 before they are ever caught, which is why most accidents that involve alcohol are caused by drunk drivers who have never previously had a DUI charge. This small group of prolific, habitual drunk drivers are virtually unknown to police.</p>
<h3><strong>The Solution</strong></h3>
<p>Based on patterns that appear in large data sets, we can identify vehicles that represent the highest risk of being involved in a drunk driving incident, even if the driver has never been previously charged for impaired driving.</p>
<p>The methodology works like this:</p>
<p>A complaint is made to 911 about a vehicle that is suspected of being operated by an drunk driver. An officer is dispatched but the vehicle is often ""gone on arrival"" by the time the officer arrives and so no contact is made and no file is generated. Research has shown that vehicles reported to 911 for impaired driving, which have previous 911 complaints, have a high probability of a future incident within the next 60 days. To determine the level of risk for a given vehicle, RTV mines data in real-time identifying all activity involving that vehicle.  It is common for these vehicles to have other incidents of anti-social and aggressive behaviours reported. Based on data from multiple sources, including past behaviours reported to police concerning a vehicle and its owner, RTV is able to identify vehicles that pose the highest risk to public safety for impaired driving.</p>
<p>An intelligence bulletin is prepared on that vehicle and appropriate action can be taken by police to influence the driver’s behaviour before, during and after the offense. A letter may be issued to notify the owner of a suspect target vehicle. A concerted effort can be made to intercept the vehicle on a number of occasions to check for impairment. Removing the ability for offenders to live in comfort thinking that they have eluded police increases both the real and perceived risk of being caught; as the single largest factor in the decision to drink and drive, this results in reduced levels of impaired driving. </p>

<h3>F.A.Q.</h3>
<p><strong><em>When will the solution be available?</em></strong></p>
<p>Development is expected to be complete within six to eight months of initial funding. Following development, testing and trialing will be complete with at least one to three trial partners over three to six months. We expect to be able to deploy the software within 12 months of initial funding.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where will the solution be trialed and made available?</em></strong></p>
<p>We are very interested in hearing from law enforcement agencies willing to work with us to implement the solution. Furthermore, your contributions will also influence the decision to deploy RTV in your community.</p>
<p>We will track all contributions to help determine which communities have contributed the most; this will be an important factor in determining the priority placed on deploying in your community. It is important to recognize there are several factors that will go into the final decision where we will do trials and early deployments; however, your contributions and support will influence the decision. </p>
<p><strong><em>Does the system use profiling?</em></strong></p>
<p>No, the system only uses data that has been previously reported to police and targets individual vehicles based on reported behaviour; in fact, this form of evidence-based policing is the antitheses of profiling.</p>
<p><strong><em>How much will it cost to develop?</em></strong></p>
<p>The total development budget is approximately $750,000, including testing and initial trials. Software development is expected to be $350,000 to $450,000, of which a portion has been completed; we require $230,000 of funding that will enable us to access additional funding sources of $220,000 to fully complete software development and begin trial deployments.</p>
<p><strong><em>What will you do if you raise in excess of $230,000?</em></strong></p>
<p>Amounts in excess of our target will be used in three ways: 1) to lessen the requirement for outside funding to complete the software development (e.g. reduce borrowing requirements), 2) to accelerate the development and move to trial more quickly, and 3) reduce the cost of deployment for testing and trials, perhaps even eliminating deployment costs for trial participants or early adopters.</p>
<p><strong><em>What will you do if you raise less than $230,000?</em></strong></p>
<p>Concurrent to our efforts to raise funding on Indiegogo, we continue to speak to a number of stakeholders that have a vested interest in reducing impaired driving. These advocate funders could play a key role in advancing the development of the software even if we were unable to reach our funding goal. All amounts raised will contribute directly to our goal of developing this technology and to reduce impaired driving.</p>
<p><strong><em>If the solution is already proven to work, why are trials required?</em></strong></p>
<p>The methodology is fully proven; however, the software that automates the methodology needs to be trialed to eliminate any initial bugs, develop the implementation process, and begin the improvement process to build the most effective tool possible.</p>
<h3>Contribute, share, and engage in the fight against impaired driving.</h3>
<p>We are looking for your financial contribution to help us complete the development of this innovative software. Every dollar raised is most appreciated in helping us reach our funding goal.</p>
<p>Sharing our story and encouraging friends and family to help us reach our goal is equally important.</p>
<p>If you are an influencer or decision maker in a community that would like to deploy this technology, or a stakeholder group that would like to support the deployment of this technology, please contact us through our web site at: <a href=""http://www.rtvgroup.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">rtvgroup.ca</a></p>
<p>Most importantly, please continue the discussion with your family and friends, particularly young people, that drinking and driving is wrong. And should you ever see someone you suspect of drinking and driving, please call 911 and report them; that call may be the data point needed by RTV to stop them from driving impaired the next time.</p>
<h3>An engaged community is the key to success.</h3>
<p>RTV Group wants to work with communities that are interested and engaged in the fight against impaired driving. If you live in such a community, be sure to rally your community's support for our campaign to raise your community's profile and improve the possibility of an early deployment in your community.</p>
<p>If you have the opportunity to introduce RTV Group and influence the decision making process in your community you might want to become a Promoter or Super Promoter to prequalify your community for early deployment and create an opportunity for RTV to be deployed in your community sooner.</p>
<p>A community that is engaged in the fight against impaired driving will have the greatest impact and success at reducing impaired driving rates with the system. Contribute, share, and engage in the fight against impaired driving.</p>

<p><br/><a href=""#Portuguese"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">Switching to electric mobility is not only a domain of cars. Precisely in urban areas switching to bicycles is desirable. But who wants to come already sweaty to the office? This makes the bimoz just right. The bimoz allows a choice between bicycle riding and electric drive. The real bimoz feeling is like ""Downhill with a tail wind"". In just a few minutes, almost everyone can turn their bicycle into a Pedelec.<br/><br/>No parking problems, no traffic jams – this is how the world looks with bimoz. bimoz is a quality product and behaves like a Swiss watch: It precisely and sensitively supports the bimoz rifer. The battery is removable and can be recharged so comfortably at home or in the workplace.</a></p> <a href=""#Portuguese"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""340"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FANhXNiaGFvw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DANhXNiaGFvw&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FANhXNiaGFvw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""620""></iframe></div></a><br/><br/><br/><a href=""#Portuguese"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457102096/zvrp6uoznm2xlpvttf95.jpg"" src=""""/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""340"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FziIcLiWa13A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DziIcLiWa13A&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FziIcLiWa13A%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""620""></iframe></div><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457102158/pspzoxeyubpqqkcnaztm.jpg"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457102183/zhcbkusrf7ouxvwo1trw.jpg"" src=""""/></a><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""#Portuguese"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self""><b>Production, Design, Electronics and Control:</b></a></p>

At this moment in time there is no alternative way to order something anywhere else. If you have further questions about payment please contact our support team at: <a href=""mailto:support@bimoz.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@bimoz.ch</a></p>
<p><b>When are the perks expected to be delivered?</b><br/>We will start delivery in October 2019.</p>
<p><b>How fast is the shipping?</b><br/>Please email us on: <a href=""mailto:shipping@bimoz.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">shipping@bimoz.ch</a></p>
<p><b>What is included in the delivery?</b><br/>According to the perk you order you will get the elements which are in the description. The bimoz-system always includes the connector, the control-unit, a battery, the power regulator, a bluetooth-speed-detector and the installation guide. </p>
<p><b>Can I pick-up the bimoz locally?</b><br/>No, we only offer shipping at the moment.</p>
<p><b>Do you offer a warranty? If so, how does the completion or transaction work?</b><br/>We offer a two years warranty according to the EC regulations. If you have further questions, please contact our service: <a href=""mailto:support@bimoz.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@bimoz.ch</a></p>
<p><b>Who do I contact if I have questions concerning the product or the payment?</b><br/>Please contact our support team directly regarding this at: <a href=""mailto:support@bimoz.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@bimoz.ch</a></p>
<p><b>Why is the bimoz so light?</b><br/>Because it is the first gearless permanent magnet direct drive, which makes it quiet, robust and brilliantly simple in construction and requires only a minimal time to install.</p>
<p><b>How good is the quality?</b><br/>We deliver high quality – made in Europe!</p>
<p><b>What kind of feeling is it to drive the bimoz system?</b><br/>Since the bimoz system is directly linked to the bottom bracket, the engine support fits perfectly on the turn – we call it „the flow“! The highly sensitive sensors optimally adjust the motor support to match your pedalling: bike riding remains bike riding and the support adjusts itself to your “flow.” This makes the support seem very smooth, harmonized and integrated into your own riding style.</p>
<p><b>Must I necessarily press in the pedals?</b><br/>Yes, of course! This is what makes cycling what it is. A little movement is good for your health. This means when you press in the pedals the bimoz gives you support. You decide how much by regulating the amount of support. Scooter driving is something completely different, and takes away the fun of riding.</p>
<p><b>Can I drive the bimoz system without motor assistance?</b><br/>Because bimoz is a gearless direct drive motor, your bicycle can be used without motor support as a normal bike without any friction or resistance!</p>
<p><b>Is the bimoz meant just for old people?</b><br/>No! The bimoz is for all people. Women who cannot keep up so readily with their sporting men, children who have the same problem as their fathers, older people who have the problem as their grandchildren – commuters, sporty people, fitness fanatics or their complete opposites. The bimoz app will make it especially essential for us all.</p>
<p><b>Can I use the bimoz for any bicycle?</b><br/>Primarily yes. There are a few bikes where the bimoz does not fit. 2 factors are crucial: The length of the frame (for the battery with control) and the crank length. The bimoz will have 5 different crank lengths, covering about 95% of the usual crank lengths. As to which crank length you require is something we can determine after the Indiegogo campaign is successfully completed. Of course the bicycle should be in an impeccable state and safe to use on the roads. Especially the brakes should work correctly. If you have any questions, please contact our support team at: <a href=""mailto:support@bimoz.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@bimoz.ch</a></p>
<p><b>How do I know how to install the bimoz sytem on my bicycle?</b><br/>We provide you with a full installation guide, also you will find installation videos on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK_bj3ycqB5i6gYCEl7MzFA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our Youtube channel</a> for all different typ of pedals (more to come).</p>
<p><b>Do I need extra tools to install the bimoz on my bicycle?</b><br/>No, any special tools are part of the delivery.</p>
<p><b>Do I need to bring my bicycle to a workshop to have it installed?</b><br/>No, because the bimoz is inherently a retrofit kit. Briefly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mount battery</li>
<li>remove only left pedals and crank</li>
<li>put our connector on your bottom bracket</li>
<li>fit bimoz</li>
<li>attach control unit and affix cable</li>
<li>finished!</li>
</ol>
<p>However, we do admit that you must have had a wrench in your hand. The time of the installation amounts to about 20 minutes.</p>
<p><br/><b>How far do I get with the bimoz?</b><br/>Honestly? To this question there are many answers or none! Depending on altitude, terrain and level of support, full-day tours are also feasible. But honestly, you are riding a bicycle, and if you ride straight ahead or downhill you can still step on the pedals. The bimoz functions without drive, without friction or extra effort on your part as with your normal bicycle. As additional batteries are offered, you should pack a second battery in your backpack on exhausting tours. For the ride to work (average 19 kilometers, in major cities 11 kilometers) a single battery charge is always sufficient.<br/>Small battery: up to 60 km*<br/>Large battery: up to 150 km*<br/><i>* depending on speed, terrain, rider weight, driving conditions</i></p>
<p><b>What is the maximum torque?</b><br/>The torque is limited to 50 Nm, this is to protect the switching gear.</p>
<p><b>Can the bimoz get wet?</b><br/>Yes, the bimoz works in any weather, at any temperature, and also in all types of terrain. Always make sure that the battery does not stay out all night that is something they generally do not like.</p>
<p><b>Is it possible to lock the battery to the bicycle? Is the battery removable?</b><br/>The battery is securely fixed to the bicycle during operation. The battery can be removed on its own for example when charging.</p>
<p><b>What is the lifespan of the battery?</b><br/>Up to 1000 cycles over a period of 5 years.</p>
<p><b>Can I use other battery packs?</b><br/>Unfortunately not, because bimoz is a self-contained closed unit. The bimoz is a smart drive and can do more than all other Pedelec retrofit kits. The controls for the bimoz and the connection for the bimoz app are located in the lower part of the battery. For this reason, batteries from other manufacturers are not suitable for the bimoz.</p>
<p><b>Where can the bimoz be used legally?</b><br/>Everywhere in structures with your local road laws.</p>
<p><b>Do I need an addition registration for the bimoz, or an additional driver's license?</b><br/>You do not need a license for the bimoz (support up to 25 km/h, max. 250 watts). However, there are the relevant road traffic regulations in different countries. If you have any questions in this regard, please contact our customer service: <a href=""mailto:support@bimoz.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@bimoz.ch</a></p>
<p><b>Do I need any safety equipment when using bimoz?</b><br/>No, but we do generally recommend wearing a helmet.</p>
<p><b>How much is the bimoz app?</b><br/>Nothing – if the Crowd Funding targets are reached, we will provide you with this app for Android and iOS for free and will continuously maintain and develop it, so you can really use it.</p>
<p><b>Is there also a cell phone mount for the bimoz?</b><br/>No, because these are available elsewhere for a reasonable price. There are already proven products from the Internet or bike stores – we do not want to reinvent the wheel here.</p>

In wenigen Minuten kann fast jeder sein Fahrrad in ein Pedelec verwandeln. Keine Parkplatzprobleme, kein Stau - so sieht die Welt mit dem bimoz aus. bimoz ist ein Qualitätsprodukt und verhält sich wie ein Schweizer Uhrwerk: So präzise und feinfühlig unterstützt der bimoz den Fahrer. Der Akku ist abnehmbar und kann so bequem zuhause oder am Arbeitsplatz aufgeladen werden.</a></p>

Zurzeit gibt es keine alternative Möglichkeit irgendwo anders zu bestellen. Wenn Du weitere Fragen zur Bezahlung hast, kontaktiere bitte unser Support-Team: <a href=""mailto:support@bimoz.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@bimoz.ch</a></p>
<p><strong>Wann werden die Perks voraussichtlich ausgeliefert?</strong><br/>Wir werden ab Oktober 2019 mit der Auslieferung beginnen.</p>
<p><strong>Wie lange dauert der Versand zu mir nach Hause?</strong><br/>Bitte sende uns dazu seine E-Mail an: <u>shipping@bimoz.ch</u></p>
<p><strong>Was ist in der Lieferung enthalten?</strong><br/>Du erhältst passend zu dem von dir ausgewählten Paket alle Bestandteile, welche in der Paketbeschreibung aufgelistet sind. Das bimoz-System enthält immer den Adapter, die Steuereinheit, einen Akku, den Leistungsregler, ein Bluetooth-Geschwindigkeitsmesser und eine Montageanleitung.</p>
<p><strong>Kann ich den bimoz auch abholen?</strong><br/>Nein, wir bieten aktuell nur den Versand an.</p>
<p><b>Bietet ihr eine Garantie an? Wenn ja, wie kann man diese in Anspruch nehmen?</b><br/>Wir bieten eine 2-jährige Garantie, entsprechend den EU-Verordnungen. Bei weiteren Fragen wende dich bitte an unseren Support: <a href=""mailto:support@bimoz.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@bimoz.ch</a></p>
<p><b>Wen kann ich kontaktieren wenn ich Fragen zum Produkt oder der Bezahlung habe?</b><br/>Bitte kontaktiere diesbezüglich unser Support-Team direkt unter: <a href=""mailto:support@bimoz.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@bimoz.ch</a></p>
<p><b>Warum ist der bimoz so leicht?</b><br/>Der bimoz ist der erste, getriebefreie Permanentmagnetmotor-Direktantrieb. Dadurch ist er superleise, widerstandfähig, brillant einfach konstruiert und superschnell anzubringen.</p>
<p><b>Wie gut ist die Qualität vom bimoz?</b><br/>Wir liefern hochwertige Qualität – Made in Europe!</p>
<p><b>Wie fühlt es sich an mit dem bimoz-System zu fahren?</b><br/>Da das bimoz-System direkt an der unteren Pedalaufhängung angeschlossen wird, ist die Antriebsunterstützung perfekt im Einklang zur Tretbewegung – wir nennen es ""den Flow"". Die ausgeklügelten Sensoren erkennen deine Tretbewegung und passen die Motorleistung entsprechend an, d.h. Fahrradfahren bleibt immer noch Fahrradfahren. Der Support fühlt sich sehr smooth und harmonisch an und passt sich perfekt an deinen eigenen Fahrstil an.</p>
<p><b>Muss ich unbedingt in die Pedale treten?</b><br/>Ja natürlich! Das macht Fahrradfahren erst zu dem was es ist. Ein bisschen Bewegung ist gut für deine Gesundheit. Das bedeutet, wenn du in die Pedale trittst, unterstützt dich der bimoz. Wie viel, das bestimmst du, indem du die Kraft der Unterstützung regelst. Mofa fahren ist etwas ganz anderes, und nimmt unserer Meinung den Fahrspaß.</p>
<p><strong>Ist es mit dem bimoz möglich auch ohne Motorunterstützung zu fahren?</strong><br/>Da der bimoz ein getriebeloser Permanentmagnetmotor-Direktantrieb ist kannst du dein Fahrrad auch jederzeit mit ausgeschaltetem Motor fahren - ohne Reibung oder Widerstand.</p>
<p><b>Ist der bimoz nur etwas für alte Leute?</b><br/>Nein! Der bimoz ist für alle Menschen gemacht. Frauen, die nicht so ohne weiteres mit ihren sportlichen Männern mithalten können, Kindern die das gleiche Problem mit ihrem Vater haben, ältere Menschen, die das Problem mit ihren Enkeln haben – Pendler, Sportcracks, Fitnessfanatiker oder das komplette Gegenteil davon. Insbesondere mit der App wird der bimoz für uns alle unverzichtbar.</p>
<p><b>Kann ich den bimoz für jedes Fahrrad benutzen?</b><br/>Prinzipiell ja. Es gibt wenige Fahrräder bei denen der bimoz nicht passt. Ausschlaggebend sind 2 Faktoren: Die Länge des Rahmens (für den Akku mit Steuerung) und die Kurbellänge. Den bimoz wird es mit 5 unterschiedlichen Kurbellängen geben, die ca. 95 % der gängigen Kurbellängen abdecken. Welche Kurbellänge Du benötigst klären wir gemeinsam nachdem die Indiegogo-Kampagne erfolgreich abgeschlossen ist. Natürlich sollte dein Fahrrad in einem tadellosen, verkehrsfähigen Zustand sein. Vor allem die Bremsen sollten einwandfrei funktionieren. Wenn Du Fragen hast, wende Dich bitte an unser Support-Team unter: <a href=""mailto:support@bimoz.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@bimoz.ch</a></p>
<p><b>Wie erfahre ich, wie ich das bimoz-System an meinem Fahrrad montiere?</b><br/>Wir liefern eine umfangreiche Bedienungsanleitung und werden ausserdem Montagevideos für alle möglichen Pedaltypen auf unserem Youtube-Kanal bereitstellen (weitere Infos folgen).</p>
<p><b>Benötige ich Spezialwerkzeuge um den bimoz an meinem Fahrrad zu montieren?</b><br/>Nein, alle benötigten Spezialwerkzeuge sind Bestandteil der Lieferung.</p>
<p><b>Muss ich mein Fahrrad zur Montage in eine Werkstatt bringen?</b></p>
<p>Nein, denn der bimoz ist von Natur aus ein Nachrüstsatz. In Kürze:</p>
<p>1. Aukkupack dran<br/>2. Linke Pedale und Kurbel abmontieren<br/>3. Verbindung ans Tretlager anbringen<br/>4. bimoz drauf<br/>5. Bediengerät anbringen und verkabeln<br/>6. fertig!</p>
<p>Dennoch geben wir zu, dass man schon mal einen Schraubenschlüssel in der Hand gehabt haben muss. Die Zeit der Montage beläuft sich auf ca. 20 Minuten.</p>

Where can I buy the bimoz?Here on Indiegogo there are ""Perks"" which are packages with corresponding equipment. At this moment in time there is no alternative way to order something anywhere else. If you have further questions about payment please contact our support team at: support@bimoz.ch
When are the perks expected to be delivered?We will start delivery in October 2019.
How fast is the shipping?Please email us on: shipping@bimoz.ch
What is included in the delivery?According to the perk you order you will get the elements which are in the description. The bimoz-system always includes the connector, the control-unit, a battery, the power regulator, a bluetooth-speed-detector and the installation guide. 
Can I pick-up the bimoz locally?No, we only offer shipping at the moment.
Do you offer a warranty? If so, how does the completion or transaction work?We offer a two years warranty according to the EC regulations. If you have further questions, please contact our service: support@bimoz.ch
Who do I contact if I have questions concerning the product or the payment?Please contact our support team directly regarding this at: support@bimoz.ch
Why is the bimoz so light?Because it is the first gearless permanent magnet direct drive, which makes it quiet, robust and brilliantly simple in construction and requires only a minimal time to install.
How good is the quality?We deliver high quality – made in Europe!
What kind of feeling is it to drive the bimoz system?Since the bimoz system is directly linked to the bottom bracket, the engine support fits perfectly on the turn – we call it „the flow“! The highly sensitive sensors optimally adjust the motor support to match your pedalling: bike riding remains bike riding and the support adjusts itself to your “flow.” This makes the support seem very smooth, harmonized and integrated into your own riding style.
Must I necessarily press in the pedals?Yes, of course! This is what makes cycling what it is. A little movement is good for your health. This means when you press in the pedals the bimoz gives you support. You decide how much by regulating the amount of support. Scooter driving is something completely different, and takes away the fun of riding.
Can I drive the bimoz system without motor assistance?Because bimoz is a gearless direct drive motor, your bicycle can be used without motor support as a normal bike without any friction or resistance!
Is the bimoz meant just for old people?No! The bimoz is for all people. Women who cannot keep up so readily with their sporting men, children who have the same problem as their fathers, older people who have the problem as their grandchildren – commuters, sporty people, fitness fanatics or their complete opposites. The bimoz app will make it especially essential for us all.
Can I use the bimoz for any bicycle?Primarily yes. There are a few bikes where the bimoz does not fit. 2 factors are crucial: The length of the frame (for the battery with control) and the crank length. The bimoz will have 5 different crank lengths, covering about 95% of the usual crank lengths. As to which crank length you require is something we can determine after the Indiegogo campaign is successfully completed. Of course the bicycle should be in an impeccable state and safe to use on the roads. Especially the brakes should work correctly. If you have any questions, please contact our support team at: support@bimoz.ch
How do I know how to install the bimoz sytem on my bicycle?We provide you with a full installation guide, also you will find installation videos on our Youtube channel for all different typ of pedals (more to come).
Do I need extra tools to install the bimoz on my bicycle?No, any special tools are part of the delivery.
Do I need to bring my bicycle to a workshop to have it installed?No, because the bimoz is inherently a retrofit kit. Briefly:

Mount battery
remove only left pedals and crank
put our connector on your bottom bracket
fit bimoz
attach control unit and affix cable
finished!

However, we do admit that you must have had a wrench in your hand. The time of the installation amounts to about 20 minutes.
How far do I get with the bimoz?Honestly? To this question there are many answers or none! Depending on altitude, terrain and level of support, full-day tours are also feasible. But honestly, you are riding a bicycle, and if you ride straight ahead or downhill you can still step on the pedals. The bimoz functions without drive, without friction or extra effort on your part as with your normal bicycle. As additional batteries are offered, you should pack a second battery in your backpack on exhausting tours. For the ride to work (average 19 kilometers, in major cities 11 kilometers) a single battery charge is always sufficient.Small battery: up to 60 km*Large battery: up to 150 km** depending on speed, terrain, rider weight, driving conditions
What is the maximum torque?The torque is limited to 50 Nm, this is to protect the switching gear.
Can the bimoz get wet?Yes, the bimoz works in any weather, at any temperature, and also in all types of terrain. Always make sure that the battery does not stay out all night that is something they generally do not like.
Is it possible to lock the battery to the bicycle? Is the battery removable?The battery is securely fixed to the bicycle during operation. The battery can be removed on its own for example when charging.
What is the lifespan of the battery?Up to 1000 cycles over a period of 5 years.
Can I use other battery packs?Unfortunately not, because bimoz is a self-contained closed unit. The bimoz is a smart drive and can do more than all other Pedelec retrofit kits. The controls for the bimoz and the connection for the bimoz app are located in the lower part of the battery. For this reason, batteries from other manufacturers are not suitable for the bimoz.
Where can the bimoz be used legally?Everywhere in structures with your local road laws.
Do I need an addition registration for the bimoz, or an additional driver's license?You do not need a license for the bimoz (support up to 25 km/h, max. 250 watts). However, there are the relevant road traffic regulations in different countries. If you have any questions in this regard, please contact our customer service: support@bimoz.ch
Do I need any safety equipment when using bimoz?No, but we do generally recommend wearing a helmet.
How much is the bimoz app?Nothing – if the Crowd Funding targets are reached, we will provide you with this app for Android and iOS for free and will continuously maintain and develop it, so you can really use it.
Is there also a cell phone mount for the bimoz?No, because these are available elsewhere for a reasonable price. There are already proven products from the Internet or bike stores – we do not want to reinvent the wheel here.

Zurzeit gibt es keine alternative Möglichkeit irgendwo anders zu bestellen. Wenn Du weitere Fragen zur Bezahlung hast, kontaktiere bitte unser Support-Team: support@bimoz.ch
Wann werden die Perks voraussichtlich ausgeliefert?Wir werden ab Oktober 2019 mit der Auslieferung beginnen.
Wie lange dauert der Versand zu mir nach Hause?Bitte sende uns dazu seine E-Mail an: shipping@bimoz.ch
Was ist in der Lieferung enthalten?Du erhältst passend zu dem von dir ausgewählten Paket alle Bestandteile, welche in der Paketbeschreibung aufgelistet sind. Das bimoz-System enthält immer den Adapter, die Steuereinheit, einen Akku, den Leistungsregler, ein Bluetooth-Geschwindigkeitsmesser und eine Montageanleitung.
Kann ich den bimoz auch abholen?Nein, wir bieten aktuell nur den Versand an.
Bietet ihr eine Garantie an? Wenn ja, wie kann man diese in Anspruch nehmen?Wir bieten eine 2-jährige Garantie, entsprechend den EU-Verordnungen. Bei weiteren Fragen wende dich bitte an unseren Support: support@bimoz.ch
Wen kann ich kontaktieren wenn ich Fragen zum Produkt oder der Bezahlung habe?Bitte kontaktiere diesbezüglich unser Support-Team direkt unter: support@bimoz.ch
Warum ist der bimoz so leicht?Der bimoz ist der erste, getriebefreie Permanentmagnetmotor-Direktantrieb. Dadurch ist er superleise, widerstandfähig, brillant einfach konstruiert und superschnell anzubringen.
Wie gut ist die Qualität vom bimoz?Wir liefern hochwertige Qualität – Made in Europe!
Wie fühlt es sich an mit dem bimoz-System zu fahren?Da das bimoz-System direkt an der unteren Pedalaufhängung angeschlossen wird, ist die Antriebsunterstützung perfekt im Einklang zur Tretbewegung – wir nennen es ""den Flow"". Die ausgeklügelten Sensoren erkennen deine Tretbewegung und passen die Motorleistung entsprechend an, d.h. Fahrradfahren bleibt immer noch Fahrradfahren. Der Support fühlt sich sehr smooth und harmonisch an und passt sich perfekt an deinen eigenen Fahrstil an.
Muss ich unbedingt in die Pedale treten?Ja natürlich! Das macht Fahrradfahren erst zu dem was es ist. Ein bisschen Bewegung ist gut für deine Gesundheit. Das bedeutet, wenn du in die Pedale trittst, unterstützt dich der bimoz. Wie viel, das bestimmst du, indem du die Kraft der Unterstützung regelst. Mofa fahren ist etwas ganz anderes, und nimmt unserer Meinung den Fahrspaß.
Ist es mit dem bimoz möglich auch ohne Motorunterstützung zu fahren?Da der bimoz ein getriebeloser Permanentmagnetmotor-Direktantrieb ist kannst du dein Fahrrad auch jederzeit mit ausgeschaltetem Motor fahren - ohne Reibung oder Widerstand.
Ist der bimoz nur etwas für alte Leute?Nein! Der bimoz ist für alle Menschen gemacht. Frauen, die nicht so ohne weiteres mit ihren sportlichen Männern mithalten können, Kindern die das gleiche Problem mit ihrem Vater haben, ältere Menschen, die das Problem mit ihren Enkeln haben – Pendler, Sportcracks, Fitnessfanatiker oder das komplette Gegenteil davon. Insbesondere mit der App wird der bimoz für uns alle unverzichtbar.
Kann ich den bimoz für jedes Fahrrad benutzen?Prinzipiell ja. Es gibt wenige Fahrräder bei denen der bimoz nicht passt. Ausschlaggebend sind 2 Faktoren: Die Länge des Rahmens (für den Akku mit Steuerung) und die Kurbellänge. Den bimoz wird es mit 5 unterschiedlichen Kurbellängen geben, die ca. 95 % der gängigen Kurbellängen abdecken. Welche Kurbellänge Du benötigst klären wir gemeinsam nachdem die Indiegogo-Kampagne erfolgreich abgeschlossen ist. Natürlich sollte dein Fahrrad in einem tadellosen, verkehrsfähigen Zustand sein. Vor allem die Bremsen sollten einwandfrei funktionieren. Wenn Du Fragen hast, wende Dich bitte an unser Support-Team unter: support@bimoz.ch
Wie erfahre ich, wie ich das bimoz-System an meinem Fahrrad montiere?Wir liefern eine umfangreiche Bedienungsanleitung und werden ausserdem Montagevideos für alle möglichen Pedaltypen auf unserem Youtube-Kanal bereitstellen (weitere Infos folgen).
Benötige ich Spezialwerkzeuge um den bimoz an meinem Fahrrad zu montieren?Nein, alle benötigten Spezialwerkzeuge sind Bestandteil der Lieferung.
Muss ich mein Fahrrad zur Montage in eine Werkstatt bringen?
Nein, denn der bimoz ist von Natur aus ein Nachrüstsatz. In Kürze:
1. Aukkupack dran2. Linke Pedale und Kurbel abmontieren3. Verbindung ans Tretlager anbringen4. bimoz drauf5. Bediengerät anbringen und verkabeln6. fertig!
Dennoch geben wir zu, dass man schon mal einen Schraubenschlüssel in der Hand gehabt haben muss. Die Zeit der Montage beläuft sich auf ca. 20 Minuten.
Wie weit komme ich mit dem bimoz?Ganz ehrlich? Auf diese Frage gibt es entweder ganz viele Antworten, oder gar keine! In Abhängigkeit von Höhenunterschied, Gelände und Support-Level sind so auch Ganztagstouren machbar. Aber ganz ehrlich, Du fährst Fahrrad - und wenn es geradeaus geht, oder bergab, da kannst du auch mal in die Pedale steigen.

We startet our indiegogo campaign with a small facebook community and thought to spread our mission in a short time. May be our target was to high ...We will be back next year - with new content, videos, smaller staggered targets and hopefully a big community all over the world.Lets stay in touch on facebook or twitter((Of course we informed our supporters and pay back their money for this campaign))THIS CAMPAIGN IS CANCELED  I  THIS CAMPAIGN IS CANCELEDENGLISHDon´t
you worry about rising gasoline and electricity prices ?
Are
Batteries and Accus empty right in the moment you need them ?now comes freee !
There is only one difference to the
energy out of your power pointThe freee cell will produce 24/7 energy
for free
!

We explore and
elaborate different kinds of free energy systems by a magnetic drive
in an interdisciplinary team of
subject-specific priorities
since 3 years. Now we are ready to dare the
breakthrough.Our goal is a global independent and public use
without economic interests. Since
our objective pursued no economic factor other than the manufacture
of the freee cells we do not receive subsidies and focus consciously
against the marketing of energy companies to enable a free
future-oriented power supply for everybody

All
this does not work without revolutionary developments … and even
not without you.


We
develop different energy concepts that make magnetic power useable.
First we transform this power into electrical energy by using a
dynamo. In this step the electrical energy already can be used.How it works
Of course we have technology and components already developed significantly. Now
we will develop this energy modules in different frame sizes and
amperages to enable power supply in buildings as well as batteries
used in cars, home appliances and of course batteries for
multifunctional use in small devices.
Safety first ! push the stop button if
you do not need electricity. The freee cell is ready to use shortly
after the resolve of the button.


Magnetical
Power is not harmful, nevertheless it is necessary to encase it for
direct use to shield it´s attraction to screens and metallic objects
in the immediate environment.

Now
we need your help for complementary research, material tests,
advanced technical requirements and the development of
maintanance-free prototypes up to the first series production to
permit a full-fleged use of „freee“ the independent energy system
no later than 2018.


Climate
change was largely caused by the improper or exessive use of existing
energy systems. Among other things, more exhaust gases were emitted,
than our nature can handle … freee could make a decisive
contribution to stop climate change and to regenerate the nature

Natural
resources are affected too. Thus, the global petroleum occur will be
depleted irretrievably in the next 50-100 years … freee waives
entirely on external energy. We need minor raw materials and aim to
use renewable resources.

Developing
countries need help on several areas. Next to water shortage, hunger
and education, energy is also an essential factor which should be in
balanced dependence to the disposal … freee is an independent
energy system which takes no more than its component and production
costs. It can be used individually and everywhere. In this way you
give future a new drive

Think
about our planet and the people who live on it

After a year and a half of designing and prototyping, our first bike seats were delivered to customers in the fall of 2013, and there are now over 200 bike seats in 7 countries across 3 continents. The number one thing our customers have asked us for over the last year: a backrest for their bike seat. So that's exactly what we plan on delivering!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1017338/files/20141115093449-splash_header.png?1416072889"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our aim is to make the backrest compatible as a removable add-on accessory to our bike seats, that way folks who've already purchased a bike seat can get one too. It will quickly and easily attach onto the back of the bike seat frame, and you're ready to go!</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">It came as a little bit of a surprise to us, but the vast majority of our customers are parents with young children. Companion Bike Seat is a great alternative to expensive cargo bicycles and gives you much the same functionality: it comes with a locking, waterproof storage compartment underneath the seat. It's a perfect way to offer to bring your kids along for the ride, and adding a backrest will make it safer to do so, especially for smaller children. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Here's what one of our more </span><a href=""http://www.thebikeseat.com/reviews.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">recent customers</a><span style=""background-color: initial;""> said about their bike seat:</span></p>
</div><blockquote><i>""I wanted to thank you for making this wonderful product.  My bike is the only form of transportation for me and my daughter, and when she approached 40 pounds and can really no longer fit into the Co-Pilot, I started to sweat. Xtracycle costs a minimum of $400 for a cargo seat for a child, and your product does it and so much more affordable! Thank you thank you, thank you!!!""<br/></i></blockquote> <div> <h3>&lt;What We Need &amp; What You Get&gt;</h3> <p>I created a proof-of-concept design for our bike seat backrest earlier this year, using parts that I purchased at the local hardware store. I'm now working on finalizing the design of the backrest and creating the necessary specs so our factory can start prototyping.</p>
<p>We initially set out to raise $2000 to pay for the cost to design and prototype our first backrests. Now that we've reached that goal, we've set for ourselves a stretch goal of $5,000, which will completely cover the cost of tooling and manufacturing of our first 100 bike seat backrests, plus all of the design costs as well. We've already received some initial feedback from the factory on the designs, and we're very close to having the factory start prototyping! We've got a couple of small changes to make, then we'll be giving the factory the go-ahead to get started on the first prototype. If all continues to go according to plan, we'll have our backrests ready for purchase in March of 2015.</p>
<p>In addition to getting a backrest for your bike seat before everyone else, we're also offering a couple brand new perks that aren't available anywhere else:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companion Bike Seat t-shirts</li> <li>Companion Bike Seat cycling caps</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <p>Here is an artist rendering of the new backrest design for our bike seats, installed onto a bike seat, overlooking San Francisco:</p>

<br/><h3>&lt;The Impact&gt;</h3> <p>Bicycle commuting has <a href=""http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/7/11/bike-lanes-study.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">massive benefits</a> to society and may be the single-most-important mass transit option we have as populations (and traffic) in cities continue to grow. Not only does it reduce traffic and pollution, but it dramatically reduces healthcare costs as well, since exercise becomes a regular part of the daily commute.</p>
<p>Companion Bike Seats make bike commuting more accessible to folks by bringing the bicycle one step closer to the automobile - now there's room for an extra passenger and cargo space to store your valuables while you're riding. All of a sudden your bicycle can be used to run so many more daily errands: picking up the kids from school, going grocery shopping, taking the bicycle out for date-night, the possibilities are endless. Just imagine, instead of driving everywhere, you're riding everywhere, and getting exercise while you're running all of your errands!</p>
<p>Adding a backrest to the bike seat makes it even easier and safer for parents to bring their children along for the ride. Plus it makes the bike seat more comfortable for passengers of all ages and sizes. Of all the things our customers have asked us for over the last year, the backrest has been by far the number one accessory requested.</p>
</div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>&lt;Backrest Design Progress&gt;</h3>
<p>Here are some photos showing the step-by-step progress we've made on the backrest design so far.</p>
<p>Initial concept drawings exploring various ways to mount the backrest onto the bike seat. We wanted it to be easy to install and remove, yet provide ample load support as a backrest for the passenger.</p>

This is about where we were at in the design process when we started our Indiegogo campaign.<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1076816/files/20141206175841-attachment_concept_2.jpg?1417917521"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Next we modeled out the design to test how much weight the backrest would be able to support. The top right screenshot show the initial concept under load testing. Based on the results of this modeling, we decided to modify the design to add more support capacity. The bottom right screenshot shows an updated model with support struts added in. <p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1076831/files/20141206180817-backrest_screenshots.jpg?1417918097"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We also reduced the height of the backrest to reduce the lever effect for the final design. Here's a screenshot of the more finalized design for the backrest, under load testing. This design almost doubled the amount of support the backrest could provide as compared to the initial design we started with.<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1076833/files/20141206181249-backrest_screenshots_2.jpg?1417918369"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Next we put together some renderings of the backrest to get a feel for how it looked on the bike seat. We used some photos of the bike seat to add the backrest in.<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1076847/files/20141206182550-backrest_renders.png?1417919150"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Based on these renderings, we decided to make a couple small changes, reducing the height of the backrest and reducing the size of the cushion slightly. Here are a couple of diagrams from the finalized specs that were sent over to our factory for cost estimates.<p></p>

<h3>&lt;Potential Risks &amp; Challenges&gt;</h3>
<p>We learned a lot about the challenges of manufacturing a wholly new product during the first year and a half launching Companion Bike Seat. Finding a suitable, trustworthy manufacturing partner is difficult at best, but thankfully that's all behind us now. The biggest risk with our backrests will be how quickly we can finalize our ""golden unit"" prototype and begin manufacturing. A golden unit is a prototype that meets all of our requirements for the final product, and enables us to tell the factory, ""Yes, that's exactly what we want. Now let's go make a thousand of them just like that.""</p>
<p>Here are pictures of the multiple iterations we made while prototyping our bike seats (this spanned around 5 months):</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1063669/files/20141202001847-bike_seat_development.png?1417508327"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>By April of 2013 we had everything nailed down and our golden unit was 95% complete. However, the storage compartment wasn't waterproof and we needed to find the right gasket material to solve this. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1076879/files/20141206183923-IMG_0920_cropped.png?1417919963"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It ultimately took our factory three months to source suitable material to begin manufacturing our bike seats. We could have moved forward without the gasket material and delivered our bike seats many months earlier, but it was critically important to deliver the highest quality product possible, so we stuck with it despite the delay.</p>
<p>We even put one bike seat through destructive load testing  to see how much weight it could withstand.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1063670/files/20141202001918-defect1.jpg?1417508358"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It ended up taking over 4000 lbs before our bike seat bent under the load.</p>
<p>Our backrests will be no different. We will make sure that the backrest is easy to install and remove, and that it's of the same high-quality standards we require for our bike seats. This may result in some small time-delays before they're ready to ship, but it will be well-worth the wait.</p>

</div> <p>Thanks for your support in making bicycle commuting the <u>norm</u> rather than the exception!</p></div>","Companion Bike Seats We launched Companion Bike Seat in 2011 with the goal of putting a second passenger on a bicycle. After a year and a half of designing and prototyping, our first bike seats were delivered to customers in the fall of 2013, and there are now over 200 bike seats in 7 countries across 3 continents. The number one thing our customers have asked us for over the last year: a backrest for their bike seat. So that's exactly what we plan on delivering!



Our aim is to make the backrest compatible as a removable add-on accessory to our bike seats, that way folks who've already purchased a bike seat can get one too. It will quickly and easily attach onto the back of the bike seat frame, and you're ready to go!
It came as a little bit of a surprise to us, but the vast majority of our customers are parents with young children. Companion Bike Seat is a great alternative to expensive cargo bicycles and gives you much the same functionality: it comes with a locking, waterproof storage compartment underneath the seat. It's a perfect way to offer to bring your kids along for the ride, and adding a backrest will make it safer to do so, especially for smaller children. 
Here's what one of our more recent customers said about their bike seat:
""I wanted to thank you for making this wonderful product.  My bike is the only form of transportation for me and my daughter, and when she approached 40 pounds and can really no longer fit into the Co-Pilot, I started to sweat. Xtracycle costs a minimum of $400 for a cargo seat for a child, and your product does it and so much more affordable! Thank you thank you, thank you!!!""  <What We Need & What You Get> I created a proof-of-concept design for our bike seat backrest earlier this year, using parts that I purchased at the local hardware store. I'm now working on finalizing the design of the backrest and creating the necessary specs so our factory can start prototyping.
We initially set out to raise $2000 to pay for the cost to design and prototype our first backrests. Now that we've reached that goal, we've set for ourselves a stretch goal of $5,000, which will completely cover the cost of tooling and manufacturing of our first 100 bike seat backrests, plus all of the design costs as well. We've already received some initial feedback from the factory on the designs, and we're very close to having the factory start prototyping! We've got a couple of small changes to make, then we'll be giving the factory the go-ahead to get started on the first prototype. If all continues to go according to plan, we'll have our backrests ready for purchase in March of 2015.
In addition to getting a backrest for your bike seat before everyone else, we're also offering a couple brand new perks that aren't available anywhere else:

  Here is an artist rendering of the new backrest design for our bike seats, installed onto a bike seat, overlooking San Francisco:


<The Impact> Bicycle commuting has massive benefits to society and may be the single-most-important mass transit option we have as populations (and traffic) in cities continue to grow. Not only does it reduce traffic and pollution, but it dramatically reduces healthcare costs as well, since exercise becomes a regular part of the daily commute.
Companion Bike Seats make bike commuting more accessible to folks by bringing the bicycle one step closer to the automobile - now there's room for an extra passenger and cargo space to store your valuables while you're riding. All of a sudden your bicycle can be used to run so many more daily errands: picking up the kids from school, going grocery shopping, taking the bicycle out for date-night, the possibilities are endless. Just imagine, instead of driving everywhere, you're riding everywhere, and getting exercise while you're running all of your errands!
Adding a backrest to the bike seat makes it even easier and safer for parents to bring their children along for the ride. Plus it makes the bike seat more comfortable for passengers of all ages and sizes. Of all the things our customers have asked us for over the last year, the backrest has been by far the number one accessory requested.
  
<Backrest Design Progress>
Here are some photos showing the step-by-step progress we've made on the backrest design so far.
Initial concept drawings exploring various ways to mount the backrest onto the bike seat. We wanted it to be easy to install and remove, yet provide ample load support as a backrest for the passenger.


Concept drawings for the shape of the cushion and how it attaches to the frame of the backrest:

Here's the design we ultimately settled on below. This is about where we were at in the design process when we started our Indiegogo campaign.
Next we modeled out the design to test how much weight the backrest would be able to support. The top right screenshot show the initial concept under load testing. Based on the results of this modeling, we decided to modify the design to add more support capacity. The bottom right screenshot shows an updated model with support struts added in. 
We also reduced the height of the backrest to reduce the lever effect for the final design. Here's a screenshot of the more finalized design for the backrest, under load testing. This design almost doubled the amount of support the backrest could provide as compared to the initial design we started with.
Next we put together some renderings of the backrest to get a feel for how it looked on the bike seat. We used some photos of the bike seat to add the backrest in.
Based on these renderings, we decided to make a couple small changes, reducing the height of the backrest and reducing the size of the cushion slightly. Here are a couple of diagrams from the finalized specs that were sent over to our factory for cost estimates.

We hope to start prototyping within the next couple of weeks, and we'll share pictures of those as soon as we have them!
<Potential Risks & Challenges>
We learned a lot about the challenges of manufacturing a wholly new product during the first year and a half launching Companion Bike Seat. Finding a suitable, trustworthy manufacturing partner is difficult at best, but thankfully that's all behind us now. The biggest risk with our backrests will be how quickly we can finalize our ""golden unit"" prototype and begin manufacturing. A golden unit is a prototype that meets all of our requirements for the final product, and enables us to tell the factory, ""Yes, that's exactly what we want. Now let's go make a thousand of them just like that.""
Here are pictures of the multiple iterations we made while prototyping our bike seats (this spanned around 5 months):

By April of 2013 we had everything nailed down and our golden unit was 95% complete. However, the storage compartment wasn't waterproof and we needed to find the right gasket material to solve this. 

It ultimately took our factory three months to source suitable material to begin manufacturing our bike seats. We could have moved forward without the gasket material and delivered our bike seats many months earlier, but it was critically important to deliver the highest quality product possible, so we stuck with it despite the delay.
We even put one bike seat through destructive load testing  to see how much weight it could withstand.

It ended up taking over 4000 lbs before our bike seat bent under the load.
Our backrests will be no different. We will make sure that the backrest is easy to install and remove, and that it's of the same high-quality standards we require for our bike seats. This may result in some small time-delays before they're ready to ship, but it will be well-worth the wait.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Let's improve our economy, our national security and our environment all in one simple step - by driving electric!  $1.5T per year is leaving our economy for foreign oil and military support and that is way too much (<a href=""http://www.rmi.org/rftransportationexecutivesummary"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.rmi.org/rftransportationexecutivesummary</a>).  Let's get off foreign oil and use local electrons to move us around.  This is not as much of a technical challenge as a political one and a public awareness issue - and that's where crowd funding can make a difference.  Here's a recent article called ""Electric Vehicles Strengthen US Competitiveness"" - <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phyllis-cuttino/electric-vehicles_b_2059945.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phyllis-cuttino/electric-vehicles_b_2059945.html</a>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
I've already built a prototype and it works well.  I can do much better by using composite materials, computer-controlled manufacturing and lithium batteries.  I have the skills and experience required and the support of a very talented team.  We need funding for tools, supplies and overhead for the shop.  This requires Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machines, honeycomb panels, electric drive systems and battery packs with battery management systems.  A desktop CNC and a desktop 3D printer will be used to create one-quarter scale models.  A large CNC is required for the full-size prototypes along with parts and materials.  At least two versions will be built using the same frame - an economy version and a performance version.  The website will be updated at least weekly with pictures, video and all information about the builds (including CAD files and parts lists).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The main focus is the frame design.  The rest of the vehicle will be relatively easy since other similar vehicles have been built based on the same or similar components.  All parts will be off-the-shelf and simple to install on the frame.  This project will produce plans, parts and complete vehicles so that people can build their own, buy a kit, or get a fully-assembled vehicle.  In addition to the frame, all attachment brackets will be provided, and wiring harness will be prefabricated.  This project will result in open-air vehicles, registered as motorcycles in most states (check your local laws).  After this project is completed, work will continue to provide bodies that can be added if desired.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Not even counting the big stuff like Global Warming and the fate of future generations, there is war, terrorism and more oil spills.  This will empower people to buy cars that are locally manufactured, will last for generations, and be easily maintained and upgraded while having the capability to make your own ""fuel"" with solar panels.  Even when charged from the grid, electric vehicles are cleaner and keep money local.  By promoting these vehicles, we can change the direction that the world is headed.  These vehicles will provide local jobs building clean transportation.</div>

Presentation
PodRide is a velomobile that is meant to be a practical every day vehicle.It has approximately the same seating position and seat height as a small car, allowing easy access and good visibility in traffic. It has four wheels to be narrow enough for bicycle paths but still be stable in the curves. It has a full waterproof body to keep you warm and dry in any weather, heated windshield, soft seat with back support, air suspension and studded tires in winter. A small trunk for your shopping bags and a tow bar for a bike trailer when you want to bring your kids.The electric motor and control system are from a standard e-bike system and should make it a street legal bike in many countries. And may then be operated on bicycle paths and without a drivers license.

  Planned actions 
Reaching: 10 000Plan one is to make drawings and building instructions of the existing prototype.Requires: that a designer puts 2-3 months of work on the project.
Reaching: 30 000Plan two is to make key parts available such as wheels and drive shafts which are difficult to manufacture yourself.Requires: more design work, find and buy parts, order and test parts and probably buy batches of some parts. 
Reaching: 50 000Plan three is to make a complete kit with all the parts and materials needed.Requires: finding manufacturers for all parts, production molds, test build kits and build infrastructure to pack and ship kits.
Reaching: 100 000Plan four is to make an easy to build complete kit, no fabrication needed (like a IKEA Furniture).Requires: redesign of many parts and details, molds and manufacturing tools and more infrastructure for pre-assembly, quality control, pack and ship kits, a lot of test building of the kits and making good instructions.
Reaching: 200 000  or morePlan five is to also offer completed kits and start developing a longer version with a small rear seats for children, dogs or more cargo
 
 Risks and problemsIt is a complex product and most of the parts have to be specially manufactured.My job is to design and purchasing machine parts but I have no experience in designing and purchasing textile parts.I'm the only fully dedicated team member today.The price on the kit may turn out to be too expensive.I do not have any big resources so if I for some reason must end the project, it is not certain that I can repay all contributions.The rules on electric bicycles differs from country to country, and some places do not allow 4 wheels on bicycles.The project is intended to promote practical bicycle cars and can lose much of its meaning if for example Toyota suddenly releases a practical bicycle cars.This may sound negative but I want to be honest and not pretend that there are no risks and problems. However, I am convinced that I can put together a good team and solves these difficulties and make a great velomobile. Spread the wordThis campaign is designed to raise money, but the long term goal is to promote bicycle-cars.

<h1>Know The Creator</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Mohsin Khan from Australia, I have been doing various science projects but this is the first one I am going to commercialize through crowdfunding. This idea Came to my mind when I was fined by traffic officer for tinted car windows as I loved them a lot. After few months I got an idea and made this prototype shown in pitch video. <br/>Now I have also tested this Electro magnetic film on a full sized room window(video attached). I have not done this thing on a commercial level, I am just raising funds so I can launch it on a commercial level.<br/><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F150553692&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F150553692&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F550063505_295x166.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<h1>IDEA</h1>
<b>It is about tinting/shading</b> your car windows/room widows only when you need. You can make you car/room windows transparent or opaque with just a click of the remote.<br/><br/><b>We are successful </b>in making a prototype of electrochromic film as shown in video we just have to make it according to the size of your car window to fit it in your car and give you the feeling of controlling the shade. It can easily be installed on car windows or any window ans is controlled by a remote. <br/><br/><b>What new have we done</b> We just made it that cheaper so everyone can afford it and secondly we have extended this high tech product to be used for any window of the world, either that be a car window or a room window. <br/><br/><b>100% successful prototype</b> shows our dedication to the project still we believe we can enhance its quality and control. We Believe that you have a right to decide when to tint your car windows and when to make them transparent.<br/><b><br/>Purpose Of Campaign</b> We need to produce these Electronics Remote Controlled at commercial level and export them through online platforms for which we need money. With 5000$ we can buy enough material to cover our day to day orders because we start production after getting orders and not pile up stock. <br/><br/><b>Hopefully</b> we will get a lot of support from you people. We will keep on updating you about our project. Thank you (Stay Tuned We will Bring Many new Innovative Projects after this)<br/>

This idea Came to my mind when I was fined by traffic officer for tinted car windows as I loved them a lot. After few months I got an idea and made this prototype shown in pitch video. Now I have also tested this Electro magnetic film on a full sized room window(video attached). I have not done this thing on a commercial level, I am just raising funds so I can launch it on a commercial level.
IDEA
It is about tinting/shading your car windows/room widows only when you need. You can make you car/room windows transparent or opaque with just a click of the remote.We are successful in making a prototype of electrochromic film as shown in video we just have to make it according to the size of your car window to fit it in your car and give you the feeling of controlling the shade. It can easily be installed on car windows or any window ans is controlled by a remote. What new have we done We just made it that cheaper so everyone can afford it and secondly we have extended this high tech product to be used for any window of the world, either that be a car window or a room window. 100% successful prototype shows our dedication to the project still we believe we can enhance its quality and control. We Believe that you have a right to decide when to tint your car windows and when to make them transparent.Purpose Of Campaign We need to produce these Electronics Remote Controlled at commercial level and export them through online platforms for which we need money. With 5000$ we can buy enough material to cover our day to day orders because we start production after getting orders and not pile up stock. Hopefully we will get a lot of support from you people. We will keep on updating you about our project. Thank you (Stay Tuned We will Bring Many new Innovative Projects after this)

Risks & Challenges
 Obviously every innovative idea has inbuilt risks involved in it but successful prototype reduces these risks. I am confident that I can produce them on a level where I can provide it to the contributors and make a setup for commercial production.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you like our idea but you can't contribute it is not a problem, just help us by spreading the word.",0.0,1,"4 Campaigns

<p><span style=""font-size: 18pt;color: #e34e09;""><em><strong><span style=""font-family: 'times new roman', times;"">Our Unique Safety Features:</span></strong></em></span></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><strong><em>Our Braking System:</em></strong></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">We only use Avid Disc Rotors and Calipers and we use a 180mm rotor on both the Front and Rear for maximum stopping power.</p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><br/><strong><em>Our eBike Motor:</em></strong></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">Our motor only works with your thumb on the throttle; it shuts off automatically when you release it.</p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><br/><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><em>Our Tires:</em></strong></p>
<p>Our Fat Tires are the widest width available which provides stability and superior stopping power.</p>
<p>Most other Fat Tire E-Bikes utilize either Center or Rear Wheel Drive Systems. This not only is a Safety Factor in Loose or Soft Terrain but, it also prohibits their ability to move through loose terrain or over obstacles.</p>
<p>The Rear Wheel Drive System is proven to turn poorly in Soft Terrain and can be hard to maneuver which can be dangerous at high speeds in soft terrain such as snow, grass or sand.</p>
<p>The Center Wheel Drive Systems can become unstable on uneven terrains and negotiating obstacles and have far more difficulty in climbing obstacles compared to the ALL-Wheel Drive System.</p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><strong><em>We have designed the first ever ALL-WHEEL Drive for SUPERIOR SAFETY and BEST for getting through most any terrain, and over obstacles!</em></strong></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">Our Copyrighted and patented Skull Tire with its’ 5” width is made of Puncture-Resistant Rubber and is currently the <strong>WIDEST FAT TIRE</strong> being  manufactured.<br/> </p>

<p>This tire is not only the coolest out there, but is very functional as well with its Center Bead.</p>
<p>You can Ride on only 10mm of tire when on hard surfaces and with 5” of width you have the widest tire made for soft terrain. This tire works with 5 PSI to 30 PSI, so it can be flattened out for very Soft Terrain and add pressure to 30 PSI for the road. This tire with its large air capacity acts just like a Shock for Jumps and Rough Terrain.</p>
<p><strong><em>Electric Bike Battery:</em></strong></p>
<p>Our batteries are made by Greenway, one of the top Battery Manufacturers is Asia. It uses a separate Water Bottle Mount that is not part of the battery like most other companies use and can be easily removed without having to take off any wires from the battery. This battery has a sealed shell that is completely <strong><em>Water Proof </em></strong>with its own built in voltage meter to tell if it needs a charge or not. Plus it has a neat carrying handle attached to it for <strong><em>Easy Removal  </em></strong>to carry for security or take with you to charge. Our 48 Volt system and uses only the best Lithium Ion Technology with Sony Cells.</p>

<p><em><strong><span style='font-size: 18pt;font-family: ""times new roman"", times;'>Frequently Asked Questions:</span></strong></em></p>
<p><i><strong>Why Doesn't Our Bike Have Shocks?</strong></i></p>
<p>Installing shocks on a Fat Tire Bike offers no significant value. The Fat Tires behave like shocks due to the large volume of air they contain and will cushion your ride over rough terrain and obstacles.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Xtreme E-Bike the Only “REAL” Fat Tire E-Bike</strong>?</p>
<p>Fat Tire Electric Bikes with Rear Wheel Motors are really not true Fat Tire E-Bikes they are really just Electric Bikes with Fat Tires and are limited to cycling on streets and hard terrain.</p>
<p>Here’s why:</p>
<p>The Rear Wheel Drive E-Bike’s front wheel will dig in and bog down in loose terrain, making it dangerous to ride. In addition, the E-Bike not drive over loose terrain and obstacles. Everyone in the auto industry will tell you Front Wheel Drive is preferred in snow and dirt and that All Wheel Drive is the most effective method for riding to places you cannot get to with Rear Wheel Drive. Our Xtreme E-Bike will allow you to cycle in any and all terrain. You will not get this with a Rear Wheel Fat Tire E-Bike. Instead all you get is an E-Bike with the look of a Fat Tire Bike!</p>
<p><strong>Our Electric Bike is Front Wheel Drive. What Exactly Does This Mean? </strong></p>
<p>The Front Wheel Drive makes our Bike the only All-Terrain Electric Bike currently in production. The Xtreme E-Bike can take you anywhere. You can ride on sand, snow, mud, upstairs and over obstacles. No other E-Bike in today’s market will allow you to do anything except ride on streets and other hard surfaces. If you are someone who enjoys riding on the beach, in the snow, on trails as well as the street, than this is the best E-Bike for you.</p>
<p><strong>What Makes Our Company Better and Able to Guarantee You Will Receive a Bike? </strong></p>
<p>We have already produced and sold close to 100 “Real” Fat Tire E-Bikes. Our Xtreme E-Bikes are not only being used for personal use but for commercial use as rental units at beach and ski resorts. What better way to tour the country side of a resort town than on a Fat Tire All Terrain E-Bike?</p>
<p>We have recently sold several E-Bikes to a company that conducts cavern tours at the Louisville Mega Cavern, a 100 acre set of caves system in Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
<p>In addition, we have received only positive feedback from everyone who has tested and ridden our E-Bikes. They all agree that Front Wheel Drive combined with peddling power allows them much more freedom to ride to places that they could not go with a Rear Wheel Drive E-Bike.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Difference between the E-Cherokee and E-Grizzly? </strong></p>
<p>These are the exact same E-Bike. The E-Cherokee is all Camouflage; the E-Grizzly is Matte Black with Neon Yellow Rims. </p>
<p><strong>What is the Difference between the 1000 Watt and 1250 Watt E-Bike? </strong></p>
<p>Power is the only difference between our 1000 Watt and 1250 Watt Electric Bikes.</p>
<p>The 1250 Watt has more power which you can use to get a little more speed to about 25 - 30 MPH and climbing and riding over obstacles; the 1000 Watt will reach speeds of 22 - 25 MPH and while it cycles over obstacles, it does have less climbing power.</p>
<p><strong><strong>How Do You Get Maximum Speed from your E-Bike?</strong></strong></p>
<p>Check and make sure that none of your brake pads are rubbing the tires. Also, be sure that your tires are inflated to 28 Ibs.</p>
<p><strong><strong>How Do I get a correct reading from my Spedometer?</strong></strong></p>
<p>Spedometers measure speed based on the diameter of tires. Most are not calibrated to proper settings. Make sure it is set at 29.5 tire diameter to ensure proper readings.</p>
<p><strong>How Far can you Travel on a Charged Battery?</strong></p>
<p>Both the 1000 Watt and the 1250 Watt Electric Bike can go around 30 Miles on hard surface at top speed without any peddling. The distance will vary if you are on soft terrain or going up hills as that takes more power.</p>
<p>If you add peddling to your journey you can substantially increase the distance you can travel on a fully charged battery.</p>
<p><strong>How Long Does it Take to Fully Charge the Battery?</strong></p>
<p>A completely depleted battery takes approximately three hours to charge.</p>
<p><strong>How Long Will the Battery Last?</strong></p>
<p>The battery is rated to last 500 cycles. A cycle = depleting a battery then fully charging it 500 times. So how long the battery last depends on how much usage. Most batteries last a lot longer than 500 Cycles more like 1000-1500 Charges because, typically a battery is never completed depleted prior to charging.</p>
<p><strong>What is Our Warranty with Our Electric Bikes?</strong></p>
<p>We offer a one year manufacturer’s warranty on all parts except the battery which is warrantied for six months.</p>

Also, with others rear torque systems, at top speed, in soft terrain, when you attempt to turn you easily could dig the wheel in and cause a dangerous situation.

Xtreme’s Fat E-Bikes will get you there!

What makes Xtreme’s eBike so much better than the rest?
Our Unique Safety Features:
Our Braking System:
We only use Avid Disc Rotors and Calipers and we use a 180mm rotor on both the Front and Rear for maximum stopping power.
Our eBike Motor:
Our motor only works with your thumb on the throttle; it shuts off automatically when you release it.
Our Tires:
Our Fat Tires are the widest width available which provides stability and superior stopping power.
Most other Fat Tire E-Bikes utilize either Center or Rear Wheel Drive Systems. This not only is a Safety Factor in Loose or Soft Terrain but, it also prohibits their ability to move through loose terrain or over obstacles.
The Rear Wheel Drive System is proven to turn poorly in Soft Terrain and can be hard to maneuver which can be dangerous at high speeds in soft terrain such as snow, grass or sand.
The Center Wheel Drive Systems can become unstable on uneven terrains and negotiating obstacles and have far more difficulty in climbing obstacles compared to the ALL-Wheel Drive System.
We have designed the first ever ALL-WHEEL Drive for SUPERIOR SAFETY and BEST for getting through most any terrain, and over obstacles!
Our Copyrighted and patented Skull Tire with its’ 5” width is made of Puncture-Resistant Rubber and is currently the WIDEST FAT TIRE being  manufactured. 


This tire is not only the coolest out there, but is very functional as well with its Center Bead.
You can Ride on only 10mm of tire when on hard surfaces and with 5” of width you have the widest tire made for soft terrain. This tire works with 5 PSI to 30 PSI, so it can be flattened out for very Soft Terrain and add pressure to 30 PSI for the road. This tire with its large air capacity acts just like a Shock for Jumps and Rough Terrain.
Electric Bike Battery:
Our batteries are made by Greenway, one of the top Battery Manufacturers is Asia. It uses a separate Water Bottle Mount that is not part of the battery like most other companies use and can be easily removed without having to take off any wires from the battery. This battery has a sealed shell that is completely Water Proof with its own built in voltage meter to tell if it needs a charge or not. Plus it has a neat carrying handle attached to it for Easy Removal  to carry for security or take with you to charge. Our 48 Volt system and uses only the best Lithium Ion Technology with Sony Cells.

Front Hub Electric Bike Motor:
Choose From:
1000 Watt or 1250 Watt with 48 Volts for the Xtreme Rider in You.
This allows you to have a Fat E-Bike that can take you literally anywhere!
Rear Wheel System:
Rear Wheel is a Quick Release Hub with a Shimano 11-36T Cassette and an 8-Speed Shimano Alivio / Altus Rear Derailleur.

Now add these two great features together and here’s what you get:
The only Fat Bike which is All-Wheel Drive on the Market. This Bike’s Drive System will literally take you anywhere, over most any object, even upstairs and over logs with ease.

Why is Xtreme E-Bike the Only “REAL” Fat Tire E-Bike?
Fat Tire Electric Bikes with Rear Wheel Motors are really not true Fat Tire E-Bikes they are really just Electric Bikes with Fat Tires and are limited to cycling on streets and hard terrain.
Here’s why:
The Rear Wheel Drive E-Bike’s front wheel will dig in and bog down in loose terrain, making it dangerous to ride. In addition, the E-Bike not drive over loose terrain and obstacles. Everyone in the auto industry will tell you Front Wheel Drive is preferred in snow and dirt and that All Wheel Drive is the most effective method for riding to places you cannot get to with Rear Wheel Drive.

What Makes Our Company Better and Able to Guarantee You Will Receive a Bike? 
We have already produced and sold close to 100 “Real” Fat Tire E-Bikes. Our Xtreme E-Bikes are not only being used for personal use but for commercial use as rental units at beach and ski resorts. What better way to tour the country side of a resort town than on a Fat Tire All Terrain E-Bike?
We have recently sold several E-Bikes to a company that conducts cavern tours at the Louisville Mega Cavern, a 100 acre set of caves system in Louisville, Kentucky.
In addition, we have received only positive feedback from everyone who has tested and ridden our E-Bikes. They all agree that Front Wheel Drive combined with peddling power allows them much more freedom to ride to places that they could not go with a Rear Wheel Drive E-Bike.
What is the Difference between the E-Cherokee and E-Grizzly? 
These are the exact same E-Bike. The E-Cherokee is all Camouflage; the E-Grizzly is Matte Black with Neon Yellow Rims. 
What is the Difference between the 1000 Watt and 1250 Watt E-Bike? 
Power is the only difference between our 1000 Watt and 1250 Watt Electric Bikes.
The 1250 Watt has more power which you can use to get a little more speed to about 25 - 30 MPH and climbing and riding over obstacles; the 1000 Watt will reach speeds of 22 - 25 MPH and while it cycles over obstacles, it does have less climbing power.
How Do You Get Maximum Speed from your E-Bike?
Check and make sure that none of your brake pads are rubbing the tires. Also, be sure that your tires are inflated to 28 Ibs.
How Do I get a correct reading from my Spedometer?
Spedometers measure speed based on the diameter of tires. Most are not calibrated to proper settings. Make sure it is set at 29.5 tire diameter to ensure proper readings.
How Far can you Travel on a Charged Battery?
Both the 1000 Watt and the 1250 Watt Electric Bike can go around 30 Miles on hard surface at top speed without any peddling. The distance will vary if you are on soft terrain or going up hills as that takes more power.
If you add peddling to your journey you can substantially increase the distance you can travel on a fully charged battery.
How Long Does it Take to Fully Charge the Battery?
A completely depleted battery takes approximately three hours to charge.
How Long Will the Battery Last?
The battery is rated to last 500 cycles. A cycle = depleting a battery then fully charging it 500 times. So how long the battery last depends on how much usage. Most batteries last a lot longer than 500 Cycles more like 1000-1500 Charges because, typically a battery is never completed depleted prior to charging.
What is Our Warranty with Our Electric Bikes?
We offer a one year manufacturer’s warranty on all parts except the battery which is warrantied for six months.
How Do We Let You Know What Size and Color E-Bike We Want?Please indicate the model and style you wish when you select a perk.

Marc Granet
Position: Partner / Driver Marc Granet, Driver, pilots Miss GEICO, the fastest offshore racing catamaran in the world and is an eight time World Champion. Like most offshore powerboat racers, he started in a v-bottom performance boat until a friend took him for a ride in a catamaran boat. ""We hit about 90 mph and that was it for me and v-bottoms,"" Granet recalled. Marc spent several years in the American Power Boat Association/Super Boat International racing circuit earning the respect of his competitors before Miss GEICO came calling in 2004. Soon, Granet found himself settled into the cockpit of Miss GEICO whose turbine engines cranked out 3700 horsepower and the boat reached speeds unheard of in the sport of offshore racing. With Miss GEICO, Granet and Throttleman, Scott Begovich, hold numerous speed records and world titles. In 2016 Granet and Begovich look forward to steering Miss GEICO to winning another National title in Clearwater and the coveted World Title in Key West. Competition from all over the world will be tough and Miss GEICO looks forward to the challenge.


Gary Stray
Position: Partner / Crew Chief World renowned master rigger, Gary Stray, joined the Miss GEICO team in 2009 and made an immediate impact in helping guide the team to another convincing World Championship victory. Gary began his career in the racing business in Southampton, England in 1988 with Cougar Marine. In 1994 he signed on with the Victory Team of Dubai rising to the head of Research & Development and ten world titles later, he set up his own rigging company in the United States. Gary established Supercat Rigging, Inc. in 2001 and his boats have won multiple championships and set numerous speed records. He has also created some of the most prestigious pleasure craft in the world today such as Speed Racer, Batman, Mercedes, Ferrari and Corvette. Miss GEICO was in the right place and time to land Gary Stray. ""Each year we have to continue to improve because our competitors are introducing newer lighter boats with greater horsepower in an effort to take away our World crown and we simply will not allow it to happen.""

<h2>The Plan</h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Drawing inspiration from motorcyclists who rode cross country in the 1930's, I plan to rebuild a 1933 Harley-Davidson VL, ship it to the west coast and ride it back across the country on US Route 50.  I'll be joined by another rider on his 1934 Harley-Davidson VLD, but that will be the extent of my support crew.  There will not be any chase trucks or other support personnel.  We'll be left with just the tools/parts we can carry, our wits and hopefully a bit of luck.  I want to prove that these old motorcycles are still viable forms of transportation and should be ridden instead of gathering dust in museums or private collections. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/173451/files/20131103184215-TrainVL.jpg?1383532935"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span><p></p></span><p></p>
<h2>Why A 1933 Harley-Davidson VL?</h2>
<p>Aesthetically, the 1933 VL is a stunning machine.  It still carries the lightweight look of an early motorcycle thanks to it's open rear fender and minimal options.  The iconic paint scheme was only available for the 1933 model year and is arguably the best that has every come out of Milwaukee.  The '33 also performs as good as it looks, which makes it well suited for this adventure.</p>
<p>The V-series went into production in 1930 to replace the F-head V-twins which had powered Harley's for almost 20 years.  This new side-valve powered motorcycle featured a number of modern improvements like an enclosed valve train, I-beam forged front forks, drop center rims, a duplex primary chain and many others.  All of these combine to make a highly dependable motorcycle, capable of crossing the US.</p>
<p>Besides dependability, the V-series is also relatively fast for an antique machine.  In 1933, the VLE model set an American production motorcycle speed record of 104 mph.  This made them popular with police forces and the following footage taken in 1935 demonstrates their ability to reach speeds over 100 mph. </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/i81lzERPC8I?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div></span><p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I don't plan on riding mine at those speeds, but this shows that a VL can handle speeds found on today's modern highways.</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">  </span></p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>Work will officially begin on the VL at the end of November on Black Friday.  The first step is to prepare the engine for rebuilding.  Appropriate engine parts will be cleaned, bead blasted and painted per original factory specifications.  All threaded holes will be chased, old bearings will be removed and all other tasks needed to completely break down the engine will be preformed.  From there the engine will be sent to American Cycle Fabrication for rebuilding and bench testing.  </p>
<p>At this point, the project will continue forward at a rate based on the amount of capital that has been raised.  In order to help insure that I reach my goals, funding for this project comes from four sources; crowdfunding on indiegogo, advertising proceeds from <a href=""http://www.ridingvintage.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Riding Vintage</a>, articles published in print magazines and the sale of personal assets.  This is a costly endeavor and I'm sure that it will take all four to see this project through to the end.</p>
<p>A completion date of mid-May has been set for having a rideable motorcycle, with hopes of riding it to the AMCA meet in Denton, NC.  This also leaves the<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> entire summer available for breaking in the engine and working out any issues that may arise.  At the beginning of September 2014, the motorcycle will be shipped out to California in preparation for my cross country ride.  That ride will begin mid to late September, with two weeks set aside for the journey across the US.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Distribution of Funds</h2>
<p>After careful calculations, I've determined that the minimum cost of purchasing all the necessary parts and assembling a bare bones 1933 VL will be about $15,000.  In comparison, a full restoration would be on the order of $30,000.  That leaves room for a lot of improvements and upgrades that could be made with additional funding.  If the budget permits, I'll first concentrate on changes to the engine to increase power and reliability.  Next I will invest in upgrading the brakes and lighting for increased safety when on the road.  Once those things are covered, I'll worry about other details like paint, additional NOS parts and possibly even a sidecar which would really come in handy for hauling gear and spare parts.  Then there are also the fundamentals like food and gas which I'm sure to need on the trip. </p>

Drawing inspiration from motorcyclists who rode cross country in the 1930's, I plan to rebuild a 1933 Harley-Davidson VL, ship it to the west coast and ride it back across the country on US Route 50.  I'll be joined by another rider on his 1934 Harley-Davidson VLD, but that will be the extent of my support crew.  There will not be any chase trucks or other support personnel.  We'll be left with just the tools/parts we can carry, our wits and hopefully a bit of luck.  I want to prove that these old motorcycles are still viable forms of transportation and should be ridden instead of gathering dust in museums or private collections. 


Why A 1933 Harley-Davidson VL?
Aesthetically, the 1933 VL is a stunning machine.  It still carries the lightweight look of an early motorcycle thanks to it's open rear fender and minimal options.  The iconic paint scheme was only available for the 1933 model year and is arguably the best that has every come out of Milwaukee.  The '33 also performs as good as it looks, which makes it well suited for this adventure.
The V-series went into production in 1930 to replace the F-head V-twins which had powered Harley's for almost 20 years.  This new side-valve powered motorcycle featured a number of modern improvements like an enclosed valve train, I-beam forged front forks, drop center rims, a duplex primary chain and many others.  All of these combine to make a highly dependable motorcycle, capable of crossing the US.
Besides dependability, the V-series is also relatively fast for an antique machine.  In 1933, the VLE model set an American production motorcycle speed record of 104 mph.  This made them popular with police forces and the following footage taken in 1935 demonstrates their ability to reach speeds over 100 mph. 

I don't plan on riding mine at those speeds, but this shows that a VL can handle speeds found on today's modern highways.  
Details
Work will officially begin on the VL at the end of November on Black Friday.  The first step is to prepare the engine for rebuilding.  Appropriate engine parts will be cleaned, bead blasted and painted per original factory specifications.  All threaded holes will be chased, old bearings will be removed and all other tasks needed to completely break down the engine will be preformed.  From there the engine will be sent to American Cycle Fabrication for rebuilding and bench testing.  
At this point, the project will continue forward at a rate based on the amount of capital that has been raised.  In order to help insure that I reach my goals, funding for this project comes from four sources; crowdfunding on indiegogo, advertising proceeds from Riding Vintage, articles published in print magazines and the sale of personal assets.  This is a costly endeavor and I'm sure that it will take all four to see this project through to the end.
A completion date of mid-May has been set for having a rideable motorcycle, with hopes of riding it to the AMCA meet in Denton, NC.  This also leaves the entire summer available for breaking in the engine and working out any issues that may arise.  At the beginning of September 2014, the motorcycle will be shipped out to California in preparation for my cross country ride.  That ride will begin mid to late September, with two weeks set aside for the journey across the US.






Distribution of Funds
After careful calculations, I've determined that the minimum cost of purchasing all the necessary parts and assembling a bare bones 1933 VL will be about $15,000.  In comparison, a full restoration would be on the order of $30,000.  That leaves room for a lot of improvements and upgrades that could be made with additional funding.  If the budget permits, I'll first concentrate on changes to the engine to increase power and reliability.  Next I will invest in upgrading the brakes and lighting for increased safety when on the road.  Once those things are covered, I'll worry about other details like paint, additional NOS parts and possibly even a sidecar which would really come in handy for hauling gear and spare parts.  Then there are also the fundamentals like food and gas which I'm sure to need on the trip.

commuter trains to environmental catastrophes on hazardous freight trains. The
Federal Railroad Administration’s accident records in the last decade (Tables 1
&amp; 2 below) categorized the various cases of derailments, collisions and
crossing accidents to profile gaps in rail safety. Eventually, the deadly
Chatsworth, CA train collision of 2008 accelerated the passing of the Federal
Safety Improvement Act (Public Law 110-432), which we believe is the beginning of
a new chapter in US rail safety. To augment these efforts to increase safety, Solfice
Research is proposing to develop a safety enhanced system to reduce the
likelihood of derailments and collisions.</span></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/283139/files/20131229163323-table.png?1388363603"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">

It is obvious to conclude
from the tables above that human error is the main cause of collisions. One of
the biggest infractions is red light violations by the train operators. If the
train automatically detects the signal state as the train approaches the
signal, red light violations can be averted. The Madera, CA accident on June
14th, 2006 and the Gary, IN crash on January 18th, 1993 are two examples that
may have been averted with such technology. Train control systems such as
Positive Train Control (PTC) use network-wide and nationwide train position tracking
to ensure that no collisions occur between any two trains. However, the GPS
(and differential GPS) localization used by PTC for achieving this goal is
insufficient in regions of high track density due to the precision needed to
identify specific track occupancy by a train. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p><p></p><p style=""font-weight: normal;"">In
addition to human error the other main cause of accidents is “faulty track
lines”. (Table 1) We could avoid many of these accidents if we develop
technologies to:</p><p style=""font-weight: normal;"">1. Stop trains automatically or remotely in addition to
cautioning/forcing train operators to follow certain recommendations and </p><p style=""font-weight: normal;"">2.
Detect faulty track lines in real-time, thus providing timely warning to
control stations. </p><p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/283142/files/20131229163615-interlocks.png?1388363775"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Solfice
Research is developing technologies to avoid both train-to-train collisions and
derailments. Our technology mitigates the human component by integrating
camera-based signal detection with the braking and acceleration interface, thus
facilitating the automatic or remote breaking and conductor notifications. This
would be instrumental in deterring certain derailments, where excessive speed
is at the root of the accident (e.g. Kensington, MD on July 29, 2002). </p><p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/283145/files/20131229163645-snow.png?1388363805"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><br/><p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">In
addition to enabling Positive Train Control technologies, Solfice Research
technology will allow for constant monitoring of the track.
Fusing high-resolution imaging output with on-board vibration measurements, we
hope to detect dangerous track conditions. Comparing the data in real-time with
historical recordings, we aim at devising decision algorithms for adjusting
locomotive speeds for safer train operation, as well as optimal preventive
track maintenance. For example, early detection of fatigue may have prevented
the environmental disaster near Superior, WI on June 30, 1992. Certain kinks in the tracks, much like
the ones that caused the May 9, 2009 derailment near Palm Coast, FL might not
have gone undetected by the high resolution cameras.</p><p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/283146/files/20131229163703-tracks.png?1388363823"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A low cost vision based solution that enables a

<li>We are asking for $150,000.00 dollars to get started on this ambitious project to help improve safety and efficiency of US Railways. Rail is the cheapest and most economically friendly way to transport goods on the surface. We are seeking to help improve the efficiency of the rail industry by deploying our remote sensing system on-board trains.</li>
<li>Our perks include everything from a thank you note, a dinner with our CEO to a complete train set for your kids to play with.</li>
<li>We will refund any unused funds. Each system costs about 50k to design and develop. We hope to deploy in 50k increments. If we don't reach the initial 50k, we will refund the entire amount. If we cross 50k we will get started on our research work.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p><p>As mentioned above, most PTC
implementations use something called a Wayside Interface Unit (WIU). This
system costs roughly $25,000 per unit for just the hardware and requires
supporting infrastructure that costs another $25,000 to deploy. In addition,
the Positive Train Control <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">communication antennas are also a prerequisite for the hardware to
communicate to a central backend control station. Extrapolating on these costs,
the FRA forecasted an expenditure of $13.2 billion for deploying PTC systems in
major U.S. railroads including those owned or operated by Union Pacific, BNSF,
Amtrak, CSX, and Norfolk Southern by the end of FY 2015.</span></p><p>Using TVS, railway operators can
achieve the same levels of safety and functionality by relying on machine
vision to extrapolate the state of the signal in the track segment and
identifying the track ID at a much lower price. Listed are the advantages of TVS:</p>
<p>1. This remote sensing based approach when added to the current
rail ecosystems enables the train to obtain context without heavy reliance on
signaling equipment. Currently a train needs constant communication with
wayside transponders resulting in plenty of integration overhead to coordinate
within a PTC ecosystem. In addition, the locomotive should be interoperable with antiquated
signaling infrastructure regardless of PTC compliance by the railroad infrastructure.
Therefore, one of the goals of TVS is to also enable trains to operate in an
ecosystem that is not currently PTC enabled.</p>
<p>To enable this, the locomotive will be equipped with 3D
LIDAR (Light detection and ranging) scanners &amp; FLIR cameras to extrapolate
information about the environment constantly in real time.  The locomotive can now detect and isolate
which train track it's currently occupying. This functionality would enable the
train to augment the current signaling infrastructure that might or might not
be PTC compliant to ensure higher line capacity and better safety envelopes.</p>
<p>A similar analogy would be if you are driving down a dark
road in a car:</p>
<p>1) The road
can have thousands of street lights alongside the road to illuminate the path;</p>
<p>2) Or the
car can utilize its headlights to see what is in front of the vehicle;</p>
<p>3) Or both approaches can complement each other to
generate a more comprehensive view </p>
<p>By taking that analogy to heart, the strategic value
addition of TVS is when the train is passing through ""dark territory""
where signaling equipment doesn't exist. TVS can provide information to the
operator to enable PTC in “dark territory”. We fuse the information obtained
from the train onboard signal bus (odometer &amp; directional heading), GPS
coordinates, and the vision based extrapolation of track ID. The communication
platform on the train can obtain the track offset position from the vision
apparatus in TVS and query the backend with the GPS coordinates to checkout a
track ID.</p>
<p>2. The system is scalable since the train vision system can
use image-stitching algorithms along with the point cloud datasets from the 3D
LIDAR scanner to accurately calculate the train position to the centimeter <b>using off the shelf components</b>. In
comparison, GPS is not accurate at a sub-meter level without deploying
expensive wayside hardware. It is a much better approach to augment the GPS
positional data with another orthogonal measurement and utilize data fusion
techniques to get centimeter level accuracy.</p>
<p>3. Trains can determine their location without relying on signaling
and can report their position to nearby trains. Even in territories where there
is no signaling infrastructure, trains can collaborate and synchronize their
speeds to prevent collisions. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Don't have cash?</p><ul>

<p></p><p></p></div>","How it works?Hardware:The Train Vision System consists of a LiDAR, FLIR camera, and a dashboard camera mounted on the locomotive.Software:The algorithms which support the Train Vision System consist of the track identification algorithm, and the signal state extrapolation algorithm.1) We identify the track the train is occupying2) We identify the signal state of the train track3) We identify where the other trains are present4) We adjust the throttle on the train and apply brakes if need beWhat we are solving?Train wrecks are incredibly destructive, from casualties on
commuter trains to environmental catastrophes on hazardous freight trains. The
Federal Railroad Administration’s accident records in the last decade (Tables 1
& 2 below) categorized the various cases of derailments, collisions and
crossing accidents to profile gaps in rail safety. Eventually, the deadly
Chatsworth, CA train collision of 2008 accelerated the passing of the Federal
Safety Improvement Act (Public Law 110-432), which we believe is the beginning of
a new chapter in US rail safety. To augment these efforts to increase safety, Solfice
Research is proposing to develop a safety enhanced system to reduce the
likelihood of derailments and collisions.


It is obvious to conclude
from the tables above that human error is the main cause of collisions. One of
the biggest infractions is red light violations by the train operators. If the
train automatically detects the signal state as the train approaches the
signal, red light violations can be averted. The Madera, CA accident on June
14th, 2006 and the Gary, IN crash on January 18th, 1993 are two examples that
may have been averted with such technology. Train control systems such as
Positive Train Control (PTC) use network-wide and nationwide train position tracking
to ensure that no collisions occur between any two trains. However, the GPS
(and differential GPS) localization used by PTC for achieving this goal is
insufficient in regions of high track density due to the precision needed to
identify specific track occupancy by a train. In
addition to human error the other main cause of accidents is “faulty track
lines”. (Table 1) We could avoid many of these accidents if we develop
technologies to:1. Stop trains automatically or remotely in addition to
cautioning/forcing train operators to follow certain recommendations and 2.
Detect faulty track lines in real-time, thus providing timely warning to
control stations. 
Solfice
Research is developing technologies to avoid both train-to-train collisions and
derailments. Our technology mitigates the human component by integrating
camera-based signal detection with the braking and acceleration interface, thus
facilitating the automatic or remote breaking and conductor notifications. This
would be instrumental in deterring certain derailments, where excessive speed
is at the root of the accident (e.g. Kensington, MD on July 29, 2002). 
In
addition to enabling Positive Train Control technologies, Solfice Research
technology will allow for constant monitoring of the track.
Fusing high-resolution imaging output with on-board vibration measurements, we
hope to detect dangerous track conditions. Comparing the data in real-time with
historical recordings, we aim at devising decision algorithms for adjusting
locomotive speeds for safer train operation, as well as optimal preventive
track maintenance. For example, early detection of fatigue may have prevented
the environmental disaster near Superior, WI on June 30, 1992. Certain kinks in the tracks, much like
the ones that caused the May 9, 2009 derailment near Palm Coast, FL might not
have gone undetected by the high resolution cameras.
A low cost vision based solution that enables a
network-wide PTC implementation with interoperability between the operators is
essential for enabling a safer railway system, and compliance with the Railway
Safety Improvement Act of 2008.

We are asking for $150,000.00 dollars to get started on this ambitious project to help improve safety and efficiency of US Railways. Rail is the cheapest and most economically friendly way to transport goods on the surface. We are seeking to help improve the efficiency of the rail industry by deploying our remote sensing system on-board trains.
Our perks include everything from a thank you note, a dinner with our CEO to a complete train set for your kids to play with.
We will refund any unused funds. Each system costs about 50k to design and develop. We hope to deploy in 50k increments. If we don't reach the initial 50k, we will refund the entire amount. If we cross 50k we will get started on our research work.
The ImpactAs mentioned above, most PTC
implementations use something called a Wayside Interface Unit (WIU). This
system costs roughly $25,000 per unit for just the hardware and requires
supporting infrastructure that costs another $25,000 to deploy. In addition,
the Positive Train Control communication antennas are also a prerequisite for the hardware to
communicate to a central backend control station. Extrapolating on these costs,
the FRA forecasted an expenditure of $13.2 billion for deploying PTC systems in
major U.S. railroads including those owned or operated by Union Pacific, BNSF,
Amtrak, CSX, and Norfolk Southern by the end of FY 2015.Using TVS, railway operators can
achieve the same levels of safety and functionality by relying on machine
vision to extrapolate the state of the signal in the track segment and
identifying the track ID at a much lower price. Listed are the advantages of TVS:
1. This remote sensing based approach when added to the current
rail ecosystems enables the train to obtain context without heavy reliance on
signaling equipment. Currently a train needs constant communication with
wayside transponders resulting in plenty of integration overhead to coordinate
within a PTC ecosystem. In addition, the locomotive should be interoperable with antiquated
signaling infrastructure regardless of PTC compliance by the railroad infrastructure.
Therefore, one of the goals of TVS is to also enable trains to operate in an
ecosystem that is not currently PTC enabled.
To enable this, the locomotive will be equipped with 3D
LIDAR (Light detection and ranging) scanners & FLIR cameras to extrapolate
information about the environment constantly in real time.  The locomotive can now detect and isolate
which train track it's currently occupying. This functionality would enable the
train to augment the current signaling infrastructure that might or might not
be PTC compliant to ensure higher line capacity and better safety envelopes.
A similar analogy would be if you are driving down a dark
road in a car:
1) The road
can have thousands of street lights alongside the road to illuminate the path;
2) Or the
car can utilize its headlights to see what is in front of the vehicle;
3) Or both approaches can complement each other to
generate a more comprehensive view 
By taking that analogy to heart, the strategic value
addition of TVS is when the train is passing through ""dark territory""
where signaling equipment doesn't exist. TVS can provide information to the
operator to enable PTC in “dark territory”. We fuse the information obtained
from the train onboard signal bus (odometer & directional heading), GPS
coordinates, and the vision based extrapolation of track ID. The communication
platform on the train can obtain the track offset position from the vision
apparatus in TVS and query the backend with the GPS coordinates to checkout a
track ID.
2. The system is scalable since the train vision system can
use image-stitching algorithms along with the point cloud datasets from the 3D
LIDAR scanner to accurately calculate the train position to the centimeter using off the shelf components. In
comparison, GPS is not accurate at a sub-meter level without deploying
expensive wayside hardware. It is a much better approach to augment the GPS
positional data with another orthogonal measurement and utilize data fusion
techniques to get centimeter level accuracy.
3. Trains can determine their location without relying on signaling
and can report their position to nearby trains. Even in territories where there
is no signaling infrastructure, trains can collaborate and synchronize their
speeds to prevent collisions. Other Ways You Can HelpDon't have cash?

</div>","Pon is:
Easy. Just slide what you want to display inside the coil. There's even a special angle in the coil that allows for objects to be inserted without crumpling.


Flexible. Pon was designed to have just the right amount of spirals to maintain a full grip and can hold thick objects like coasters and album jackets, or many layers of small objects like reminder notes. It's made from heat-treated stainless steel, which allows it to spring back to it's original shape even after it's expanded.


Small. About the same size as a regular thumb tack. 


Strong. Pon can do some serious heavy lifting.


Versatile. You can now express yourself and display things you would have previously stashed in a drawer or shoebox.


Ready to go. Pon has been prototyped extensively and fine tuned to have the best tolerances for the most amount of jobs. 


Made in The USA. We've explored where to make Pon and have been lucky enough to find an exceptional and experienced local manufacturer ready to go.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The Scharf AeroCar is a street-legal car that can fly like a normal private aircraft such as a Cessna.  On the road it can be driven at speeds up to 80 MPH and can achieve 30+ MPG fuel mileage.  In the air it can be flown at 150 MPH and can achieve 23 MPG fuel mileage.</p>

<p>The Scharf AeroCar also features a state-of-the-art hybrid electric/diesel 200 horsepower motor that is capable of providing power to both the drive-train for car operation and the propeller for aircraft operation.  The motor can be fueled at any neighborhood gas station with regular diesel, off-road diesel, or bio-diesel fuel.  This is a major achievement, as these fuels are less than half the cost of AVGAS and jet fuel that is normally required by small aircraft.</p>
<p>On the road, the Scharf Aerocar can drive at speeds up to 80 MPH and can achieve more than 25 MPG fuel economy.  In the air, the Scharf Aerocar can fly at speeds up to 150 MPH and can achieve 23 MPG fuel economy.</p>
<p>Its excellent fuel performance allows the Scharf AeroCar to have a carbon footprint the size of a normal SUV.  By contrast, a small aircraft has the carbon footprint of three SUV's.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/162707/files/20131029193143-AeroCar_game_changer2.jpg?1383100303"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p>The Scharf AeroCar can be manufactured and brought to market for a cost less than $100,000.  Because its wings fold flush alongside the passenger compartment, it can be parked in any garage, saving an owner the expense of hanger space.  It can be insured using a hybrid auto/air policy at less cost.  It requires far less maintenance than a standard small aircraft and does not require fuel loading at an airport, as the owner can simply drive to the nearest gas station.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest savings, however, is the operating cost.  In the air, a small aircraft will burn between 10-15 gallons of AVGAS per hour.  AVGAS is at least $6.00 per gallon and can be as expensive as $12.00 per gallon ($60-$120 per hour).  The Scharf Aerocar burns just under 5 gallons of road-grade diesel fuel per hour at cruise ($20 per hour).</p>
<p>On the road, the Scharf AeroCar can transport 4 passengers and 500 pounds of load at at least 25 MPG.  It is possible the Scharf AeroCar will actually achieve 40 MPG due to its streamlined shape, but that will be impossible to test until it actually drives on the highway.</p>

<div>Day by day born a new, good solutions what satisfy more and more on-demand while they want to tackle a „last mile problem”. The size is very defining in all cases. In section while we were looking for a solution for this problem and thought forward this borned a w scooter. A (human forced) vehicle what you can transform a practical small size and wear part of your clothes also. If you wear a vehicle live together with a crowded public transportation became more efficient, because no need more special place and attention. Neither while you travel nor when you direct, because the vehicle (if you wear it) is not a special, but that and the user form a unity.<br/>

Our vision</b><br/>
</div>
<div>Have you ever wanted to get somewhere fast but always had the problem of where to put your bike? Of course you could have taken your skateboard but you haven’t learned to jump the curves yet. And there is always the dilemma of where to put your ride. Well, we have come up with a perfect solution. The w scooter is a foldable scooter that you can wear. That’s right, after getting where you want to go, you can fold it up and carry it on your waste. It fits your body perfectly and when you want to bolt, you just whip it out and go! Some of the advantages of the w scooter:<br/>

</div>","About this project

Day by day born a new, good solutions what satisfy more and more on-demand while they want to tackle a „last mile problem”. The size is very defining in all cases. In section while we were looking for a solution for this problem and thought forward this borned a w scooter. A (human forced) vehicle what you can transform a practical small size and wear part of your clothes also. If you wear a vehicle live together with a crowded public transportation became more efficient, because no need more special place and attention. Neither while you travel nor when you direct, because the vehicle (if you wear it) is not a special, but that and the user form a unity.









Our vision

Have you ever wanted to get somewhere fast but always had the problem of where to put your bike? Of course you could have taken your skateboard but you haven’t learned to jump the curves yet. And there is always the dilemma of where to put your ride. Well, we have come up with a perfect solution. The w scooter is a foldable scooter that you can wear. That’s right, after getting where you want to go, you can fold it up and carry it on your waste. It fits your body perfectly and when you want to bolt, you just whip it out and go! Some of the advantages of the w scooter:





get to wherever you want fast and easy (it’s a simple scooter)


environmentally friendly (no motor)


has health benefits (you are outside and moving)


fits around your waist without bumping into doorways


you can carry it with a strap


you can take it anywhere (trains, busues, subways, and even the beach)


thief-proof (it is strapped to you)


Target audience
Just about anyone with 2 legs and feet. Of course people who have ridden skateboards, scooters, longboards are at an advantage but basically anyone can learn using it in 5 minutes. All you need is a little sense of fun. There is no age limit.






Used materials, technical details: plywood, stainless steel, steel, foamed PVC, polystyrene, weight: 2,3 kg
How it works






Development

At the current stage the w scooter is a great ride (it is on 70%) but we would like to make the following developments what will be finished until the middle of summer 2016.




develop and refine the use of materials


improve on the weight and durability


research water resistance


find a way for easy cleaning


tiller size adjustability and customization


customization to fitting around the waist


maximizing efficiency of the wheel size


adding a feature to hide the wheel so it makes no direct contact with clothes


adding an extra element to rest the second foot

Q:The price is very low for an electirc bicycle. Why?
A: Coolpeds USA's mission is to offer great products that are affordable for everyone.

Q: Does the iBike 2 come in different sizes? 
A: The iBike 2 is designed to be one size fits all, because it is highly adjustable. The seat ride height and front handle can be adjusted based on your build.

Q: How much does the iBike 2 weigh?
A: It weight about 18 kg, which is about 39 lbs. 
Q: How long does the iBike 2 battery last?
A: The iBike 2's lithium battery provide reliable power for up to about 37 miles on power assist pedal mode.  The battery takes around 3-4 hours charge.  
Q: Can I still go on the iBike if the battery runs out of power?
A: That is a BIG Yes!  You can still ride it like a normal bike and it is a very smooth bike to ride.
Q: Can the battery be removed?
A: Yes. The battery is replaceable and can be removed in less than 5 seconds after you unlock it with your unique key.
Q: Can I test ride the iBike 2?
A: At this stage test rides are only available in Los Angeles. Please contact us by email for a test ride.
Q: Does it require assembly?
A: It will require minimal assembly, and we recommend customers with no experience in bikes take their iBikes to a local bike shop before use.
Q: How much does shipping cost for the iBike 2?
A: International shipping will cost $160 USD because each bike is shipped directly from the factory to you in order to minimize costs for you.  Now we are offering a limited number of bikes with a much discounted shipping of only $99, duty and taxes not included, within the US and Canada!
Q: What kind of warranty does the iBike have?  
A: All iBikes and batteries come with a 2 year manufacturer's warranty. But wearable items such as brakes and tires are not covered by the warranty.   Parts will be sent to customers for most repairs, and most local bike shops can repair it since the iBIke 2 is based on many standard bike parts.   It is basically very easy to maintain!

</div><div><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'><br/></span></div><div>
<p>Coolpeds USA's Briefcase is a high-quality carry-on suitcase with a built-in electric scooter that you can ride at up to 20 km/hour to your destinations like the office, subway, trains, Starbucks, airport boarding gates, restaurants, scenic spots near your hotel, etc.  <b>It is like a ""mini Tesla"" at your service all the time!</b></p>
<p>When you arrive, just fold it up and pull it along like a normal suitcase.  From the app, you can track its location.  With <span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>the USB charging port, you can juice up your phone and iPad, all while alleviating the pollution and congestion in the city!</span><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'/></p>

<p>After more than a century of little innovation in the luggage industry, we re-invented the suitcase to make life easier for the modern commuter and traveler. No more tiring walks to the train station, boarding gates, to remote parking lots, classrooms, etc. <b> With the Coolpeds Briefcase, you will travel more comfortably and be the coolest frequent traveler flying across the airport!</b><br/></p>

<h2>Save more than 50 trees every year by reducing CO2 by commuting on an electric scooter for 10 km everyday. </h2>
<p></p>
<p>A single young <span>tree can only
absorb about 11kg of CO2 per year.</span><br/></p>
<p>Average emission of a car is 160 gram of CO2 per km.</p>
<p>10 km per day x 160
gram of CO2 x 365 days = 584 kg of CO2 reduced per year
per 1 Coolpeds user</p>
<br/><p><strong style=""line-height: 24px;font-size: 18px;"">The Coolpeds Briefcase makes urban commute and travel fun</strong><br/></p>
<p>Commuting is tough for people living in big cities plagued by air pollution, traffic congestion and an energy crisis. Urban people usually commute within a radius of 2-5 km, a distance too far to walk and too difficult to drive and to find parking or taxis.  Bikes are great but are too big for many places such as offices, supermarkets, cafes, trains, subways, etc; so they get stolen easily.</p>
<p><b style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>By 2030, there will be about 5 billion people living in cities globally, and they all need compact and green forms of transportation.</b></p>

What is the Coolpeds Briefcase?

Coolpeds USA's Briefcase is a high-quality carry-on suitcase with a built-in electric scooter that you can ride at up to 20 km/hour to your destinations like the office, subway, trains, Starbucks, airport boarding gates, restaurants, scenic spots near your hotel, etc.  It is like a ""mini Tesla"" at your service all the time!
When you arrive, just fold it up and pull it along like a normal suitcase.  From the app, you can track its location.  With the USB charging port, you can juice up your phone and iPad, all while alleviating the pollution and congestion in the city!


After more than a century of little innovation in the luggage industry, we re-invented the suitcase to make life easier for the modern commuter and traveler. No more tiring walks to the train station, boarding gates, to remote parking lots, classrooms, etc.  With the Coolpeds Briefcase, you will travel more comfortably and be the coolest frequent traveler flying across the airport!




Save more than 50 trees every year by reducing CO2 by commuting on an electric scooter for 10 km everyday. 

A single young tree can only
absorb about 11kg of CO2 per year.
Average emission of a car is 160 gram of CO2 per km.
10 km per day x 160
gram of CO2 x 365 days = 584 kg of CO2 reduced per year
per 1 Coolpeds user
The Coolpeds Briefcase makes urban commute and travel fun
Commuting is tough for people living in big cities plagued by air pollution, traffic congestion and an energy crisis. Urban people usually commute within a radius of 2-5 km, a distance too far to walk and too difficult to drive and to find parking or taxis.  Bikes are great but are too big for many places such as offices, supermarkets, cafes, trains, subways, etc; so they get stolen easily.
By 2030, there will be about 5 billion people living in cities globally, and they all need compact and green forms of transportation.

<p><b>Your electric
bill is a major part of your budget, along with gasoline, food and other energy
related necessities that our government and its special interest partners are
denying us of this technology that has the potential to not only end dependence
on foreign oil, but to lower energy prices to what they used to be 20 years
ago. We can’t build our own cars but we can generate our own electricity. Join us
and we can make this happen!</b><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><b>My name
is Rod Nelson, a self-educated, retired 83 year old mining and construction
business owner. Businesses can absorb these costs, by price adjustments </b><b>but us home owners</b><b> don’t
have this luxury. Competition forces a business to lower costs wherever
possible. When you don’t have a college education, challenges must be solved
with common sense learned from experience.</b>
</p>
<p><b>As a
child, like most children, when given a chore by mother. I often rebelled, with
“I can’t”, which invariably earned a vociferous, “can’t never did nuthin”,
from mother and the chores got done.</b></p>
<p><b>This
engrained ethic is responsible for my business successes and the many patented
inventions to resolve difficult challenges. Most of my inventions were labor
saving tools and machines used in my businesses and never commercialized, but
fuel costs for my heavy equipment and portable generators drove me to
developing more efficient engines. Two patents were issued for engines that
were 3 times more efficient and non-polluting. I received no support from the
government, auto industry nor the elitist universities, so for the next 10
years I devoted my efforts to adapting these engines to power electric
generators using CO2 as the working fluid. <br/></b></p>

<p><b>Needless
to say, no support, rather a collective “you can’t” response from the

dollars on energy projects that are historically inefficient, while denying the
world of this obviously disruptive technology, that not only substantially
reduces the demand for oil but ends the perceived CO2 global warming threat and
the funding of mid-eastern sponsored terrorism. Government and their special
interest partners have demonstrated their collective determination to keep us
from enjoying the monetary benefits of these patented technological advances.

<p><b>“Everybody talks about the weather but nobody
does anything about it!”(Mark Twain)</b></p>
<p><b>This technology does something about climate
change, global warming, smog and acid rain. Many global politicians are
convinced that Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is changing the weather, but are doing
nothing about it <span>and apparently don’t
want to. </span></b><b>Our engine principals are covered in the first 2
issued patents. The efficiency alone reduces the CO2 emissions by more than
50%, which is significant and possible if the electric and Auto industry will
recognize and adopt it. Market forces will make this happen but probably not
for 10- 20 years. These two industries account for 80% of man-made CO2
emissions into the atmosphere. </b></p>
<p><b>The environment need not
suffer this inexcusable time delay!</b></p>
<p><b>Our efforts are now concentrated on making
available to all global electric users, even those that do not have access to
fossil fuels. Our 3<sup>rd</sup> patent allows us to power standalone
generators of any KW output using CO2 as the power source, the auto industry
has demonstrated strong opposition, as will the utility industry, </b><b>we can’t build our own
cars, </b><b>however the electric
companies cannot stop anyone from making their own electricity, which is
exactly what our commercial CO2 powered generators are designed to do. Unlike
solar PV cells and wind turbine standby generators that provide limited storage
capability (2-3 days @ minimum usage) and require continued obligation to the
utility grid, our generators, using any heat source (solar, waste heat from any
source) <span>will provide whole house power
24/7 all year long, total freedom from the grid, with its unpredictable
seasonal disruptions, </span></b><b>and no

Short Summary

</h3>
<p><b>Our planet is threatened by 2
paradoxical dilemmas: 1. Global warming caused by CO2. And 2. Global TERRORISM.
Seemingly, unrelated, the reduced cost
of energy, made possible by this technology, means lower prices of your food,
gasoline and all of life’s necessities.<span> 
</span></b><b>The global impact may not guarantee world peace
but the effect of billions of dollars removed from terrorist hands will
certainly restrict the actions emanating from the mid-east making the world a
much safer place, WITH A MUCH CLEANER ATMOSPHERE.</b></p>

<p><b>Pegi here, Having worked closely with the public all
of my life, I am very aware of the concerns of the average person, it is
discussed everyday.</b></p>
<p><b>We feel that nothing is ever going to change but that
is not true and change can come about not by politicians but by you and
me.<span>  </span></b></p>
<p><b>Now I am going to tell you how, about 13 years ago our
group began work on a simple engine, it was found through R&amp;D that this
technology could be powered by Carbon Dioxide/CO2, you may or may not believe
CO2 is the cause of global warming, we just know that it can be used in the
most productive manner, proven by us. </b></p>
<p><b>So your next question is probably so what does this
have to do with my life ?</b></p>
<p><b>Everything, from the cost of your electric, primarily,
to the cost of your food, clothes, you name it and it is costing you, simply
because every dollar you spend for electric is also being spent by the folks
who manufacture and grow those necessities.</b></p>
<p><b>The Nelson CO2 engine used to generate electricity in
your home or business frees you from an electric bill each month, the money
spent on electric can be used to pay for the generator that will give you
electric 24/365 for pennies a day, let the winds blow, throw rain, sleet, snow
and hail at us and you are still in a home or business with electric. And you
are not going to die in your bed from carbon monoxide poisoning<span>  produced by todays standby generators, and
you are not going to have to go out and refuel the thing every hour or so.</span></b></p>
<p><b>How can I get one is probably your next question ?</b></p>
<p><b>This is how, you know the old saying it takes a
village, our village is all of you contributing to our crowd funding campaign,
give as you can and help us get this on the market and out to you, we need your
help, we and our small group have paid for everything so far and I have to tell
you we have hit a financial brick wall.</b></p>
<p><b>Together we can do this, oh and I forgot to tell you
this technology is as green as grass. </b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F_Fj2Uc-M_5o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_Fj2Uc-M_5o&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F_Fj2Uc-M_5o%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>

<h3><b><u>WHAT WE NEED</u></b></h3>
<p><strong>The government and their industrial partners
have prevented you from enjoying the benefits this technology will give you.  $95,000
will make possible the final production design,
special tooling and safety requirements, making possible the commercialization
of an electric generator for your home or small business, freeing you from the
monopolized electric companies and their monthly billing forever.
Continued development of
patentable products, learned from this work, will create a market force for
greatly reduced food, gasoline and fuel prices for everyone, which will also
reduce CO2 in the atmosphere. Pegi and I have invested our life savings to get

GLOBAL PEACE MACHINE

Your electric
bill is a major part of your budget, along with gasoline, food and other energy
related necessities that our government and its special interest partners are
denying us of this technology that has the potential to not only end dependence
on foreign oil, but to lower energy prices to what they used to be 20 years
ago. We can’t build our own cars but we can generate our own electricity. Join us
and we can make this happen!
My name
is Rod Nelson, a self-educated, retired 83 year old mining and construction
business owner. Businesses can absorb these costs, by price adjustments but us home owners don’t
have this luxury. Competition forces a business to lower costs wherever
possible. When you don’t have a college education, challenges must be solved
with common sense learned from experience.

As a
child, like most children, when given a chore by mother. I often rebelled, with
“I can’t”, which invariably earned a vociferous, “can’t never did nuthin”,
from mother and the chores got done.
This
engrained ethic is responsible for my business successes and the many patented
inventions to resolve difficult challenges. Most of my inventions were labor
saving tools and machines used in my businesses and never commercialized, but
fuel costs for my heavy equipment and portable generators drove me to
developing more efficient engines. Two patents were issued for engines that
were 3 times more efficient and non-polluting. I received no support from the
government, auto industry nor the elitist universities, so for the next 10
years I devoted my efforts to adapting these engines to power electric
generators using CO2 as the working fluid. 

Needless
to say, no support, rather a collective “you can’t” response from the
government and their industrial partners, who are spending billions of our tax
dollars on energy projects that are historically inefficient, while denying the
world of this obviously disruptive technology, that not only substantially
reduces the demand for oil but ends the perceived CO2 global warming threat and
the funding of mid-eastern sponsored terrorism. Government and their special
interest partners have demonstrated their collective determination to keep us
from enjoying the monetary benefits of these patented technological advances.
They are saying ""you can't"" I am saying ""WE CAN AND
WILL"", and you cannot stop us from making our own electricity.
ENERGY
EFFICIENCY AND CLIMATE CHANGE!
For the last 13 years I have worked to bring a
bench model to its present state, which functions as described in the patent
applications, but not to a level for commercialization. Because to fast track
this stage and take advantage of the many intellectual properties that will
evolve from continued R&D, we are exploring alternative funding sources.
Pegi and I have invested our life savings to get to this stage and despite the
hardships and lack of government support we know you and the rest of the world
need and deserve this God given economic break. 
 
“Everybody talks about the weather but nobody
does anything about it!”(Mark Twain)
This technology does something about climate
change, global warming, smog and acid rain. Many global politicians are
convinced that Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is changing the weather, but are doing
nothing about it and apparently don’t
want to. Our engine principals are covered in the first 2
issued patents. The efficiency alone reduces the CO2 emissions by more than
50%, which is significant and possible if the electric and Auto industry will
recognize and adopt it. Market forces will make this happen but probably not
for 10- 20 years. These two industries account for 80% of man-made CO2
emissions into the atmosphere. 
The environment need not
suffer this inexcusable time delay!
Our efforts are now concentrated on making
available to all global electric users, even those that do not have access to
fossil fuels. Our 3rd patent allows us to power standalone
generators of any KW output using CO2 as the power source, the auto industry
has demonstrated strong opposition, as will the utility industry, we can’t build our own
cars, however the electric
companies cannot stop anyone from making their own electricity, which is
exactly what our commercial CO2 powered generators are designed to do. Unlike
solar PV cells and wind turbine standby generators that provide limited storage
capability (2-3 days @ minimum usage) and require continued obligation to the
utility grid, our generators, using any heat source (solar, waste heat from any
source) will provide whole house power
24/7 all year long, total freedom from the grid, with its unpredictable
seasonal disruptions, and no
more electric bills forever!!




Short Summary


Our planet is threatened by 2
paradoxical dilemmas: 1. Global warming caused by CO2. And 2. Global TERRORISM.
Seemingly, unrelated, the reduced cost
of energy, made possible by this technology, means lower prices of your food,
gasoline and all of life’s necessities. 
The global impact may not guarantee world peace
but the effect of billions of dollars removed from terrorist hands will
certainly restrict the actions emanating from the mid-east making the world a
much safer place, WITH A MUCH CLEANER ATMOSPHERE.

Pegi here, Having worked closely with the public all
of my life, I am very aware of the concerns of the average person, it is
discussed everyday.
We feel that nothing is ever going to change but that
is not true and change can come about not by politicians but by you and
me.  
Now I am going to tell you how, about 13 years ago our
group began work on a simple engine, it was found through R&D that this
technology could be powered by Carbon Dioxide/CO2, you may or may not believe
CO2 is the cause of global warming, we just know that it can be used in the
most productive manner, proven by us. 
So your next question is probably so what does this
have to do with my life ?
Everything, from the cost of your electric, primarily,
to the cost of your food, clothes, you name it and it is costing you, simply
because every dollar you spend for electric is also being spent by the folks
who manufacture and grow those necessities.
The Nelson CO2 engine used to generate electricity in
your home or business frees you from an electric bill each month, the money
spent on electric can be used to pay for the generator that will give you
electric 24/365 for pennies a day, let the winds blow, throw rain, sleet, snow
and hail at us and you are still in a home or business with electric. And you
are not going to die in your bed from carbon monoxide poisoning  produced by todays standby generators, and
you are not going to have to go out and refuel the thing every hour or so.
How can I get one is probably your next question ?
This is how, you know the old saying it takes a
village, our village is all of you contributing to our crowd funding campaign,
give as you can and help us get this on the market and out to you, we need your
help, we and our small group have paid for everything so far and I have to tell
you we have hit a financial brick wall.
Together we can do this, oh and I forgot to tell you
this technology is as green as grass. 

WHAT WE NEED
The government and their industrial partners
have prevented you from enjoying the benefits this technology will give you.  $95,000
will make possible the final production design,
special tooling and safety requirements, making possible the commercialization
of an electric generator for your home or small business, freeing you from the
monopolized electric companies and their monthly billing forever.
Continued development of
patentable products, learned from this work, will create a market force for
greatly reduced food, gasoline and fuel prices for everyone, which will also
reduce CO2 in the atmosphere. Pegi and I have invested our life savings to get
to this stage and consider this technology a God given gift to humanity worth
dying for. With your help it will be your gift to yourself,
your loved ones and the rest of the world.



WHAT YOU GET
Your generator
will be set up and running, with no out of pocket expense and half of your
previous electric bill will pay for the generator, the other half is yours to
do whatever you enjoy. When the generator is paid off (3 to 5 years) you no
longer have an electric bill for the rest of your life and if you ever choose
to sell your home the added value will add substantial appeal to a buyer and
the appraisal value. Your contribution at this time will make possible mass
commercialization and a gift
that keeps giving to yourself, your loved ones and the rest of the world.",0.0,6,"2 Campaigns

Mainly, how can we guarantee that this bike will be reliable for different riders, load weights, road conditions and environmental conditions.</p><p>So we built a testing rig... </p><p> </p><h3><b>The Chariots</b></h3><div>

<p>When it comes to product testing, controlled lab tests only tell part of the story. With great (electrical) power comes great responsibility and the electronics needed to be absolutely reliable.</p>
<p>To test the bikes at triple their intended tow weight we built The Chariots, the spawn of a late-night brainstorm into how to measurably stress test the AM1 in real world conditions.</p>
<p>The idea was to capture the weight of the rider and passenger, then conduct a series of tests to learn how each electrical component behaves under increasing loads. To no ones surprise, they were SERIOUSLY FUN to ride. To date, we've successfully completed tests with a leisure cyclist effortlessly towing over 250 kg’s (2 passengers + 1 rider) proving the power of the AM1. See for yourself.</p>

<h3><b>The Battery</b></h3>
<p>We completed an extensive program of battery development to find the perfect voltage, power and size of battery. We hand-soldered prototype batteries ourselves, rode tens of thousands of miles on them, and continually revised the size and placement until we we achieved the right power to weight ratio in a durable, portable and safe form factor.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
<p><b>Assembly:</b> Due to the nature of shipping bikes internationally some assembly will be required. We provide clear video and written instructions, as well as the tools required with every bike. If you don't feel confident with basic assembly we have a process in place where can, for a small fee, ship the bike to your local bike store where it will be assembled for you and collected in person. Please add on 'Local Assembly' to your pledge to activate this option.</p>
</div><div><div>
<p><b>Battery life:</b> On medium assist with a 165lbs (75kg) rider the battery life ranges from 25-50km. Actual battery life will vary based on a numbers of factors including rider weight, effort contributed by rider, wind, elevation and external temperature.</p>
<p><b>Production:</b> All AM1 models in this campaign are production samples made using the manufacturers and supply chain we have in place. There may be some changes, modifications or improvements made to the scaled manufactured version which will be shipping to all backers.</p>
<p><b>Local Taxes for non-EU:</b> While we do our best to comply with local tax laws you may be subject to import taxes or duties.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>All the bikes shown in our film and campaign, unless labeled as a prototype are a production-ready factory sample. We have a 4 year relationship with our main manufacturer. The samples they have sent us have over 50,000 miles of testing, by us and our beta testers. We did not want to end up as another crowdfunding project that promises the world and delivers nothing years after the campaign ends. So we invested a lot of time and money early on in the process to ensure that when our campaign ends, we know how we're going to scale our manufacturer to fulfil your pledges.</p>

</div></div></div>","The AM1 is a lightweight motorised bike. It looks like a bike, handles like a bike, weighs the same as a bike but rides like you're freewheeling downhill with a tailwind. The best part, you can own one starting at $799.Moving through cities is expensive, uncomfortable and time-consuming. Our aim is to relieve you from the shackles of public transport and endless queues of traffic, through our product the AM1. Electric bikes on the market today don't address these issues, but add further problems, like features you don't need, complexity and lots of extra weight. 
 That's why we created the AM1. It brings together the lightweight handling and simplicity of a single speed bike, with the effortlessness of an electric bike. It has a lightweight 20-mile battery that easily covers an average commute of 8.5 miles each way with plenty of range spare to meet your friends after work.A lean battery meant we could create a compact motor that gets rid of gears altogether. We've merged the best of a classic single speed bike with the effortlessness of an electric one, into a sleek, minimal design.You can own the AM1 starting from $799. 

  Did we mention that the AM1 is light? It's 13.5kg (30lbs)  including battery. The average bike weighs 25lbs while the average city share bikes (Santander Cycles, London / Citibike, NY) weighs 23kg's (50lbs)  The AM1 is easy to take upstairs, throw in the back of a car or hang on the wall if that’s what you’re into.   Inspired by the simple and ultra-reliable mechanics of single-speed bikes, the AM1 has a single-speed in it's DNA and electrons in its blood.  The motor gives you a boost when you really need it. The sensor in the pedals delivers smooth, controlled power relative to the speed of your pedalling. Pedal slower to slow down, faster to speed up. Smile as you pass lycra-clad roadies with the knowledge that the AM1 probably costs less than their carbon fibre rear wheel.   How does it work? The pedal sensor detects when you're pedalling and assists you depending on how much effort you put in.Want to go faster with less effort, turn the assist up. Want to get your heart rate up, turn the assist down.With the assist off, the AM1 rides like a normal bike without the motor resistance often found on conventional electric bikes.  The goods news is that all mechanical parts are compatible with standardised bike components. Support your local bike store and fulfil your 'dog in basket' dreams. BYOD.  Pre-order the AM1 now from $799. This is an industry first price-point for an e-bike of this design, weight and capability. 
  The AM1 is our entry level e-bike designed to suit daily commutes. The progressive frame geometry is inspired by fixed gear track bikes. The 16.5"" (420 mm) straight handlebars provide a responsive and agile feel. The deep-rimmed wheels create a clean aerodynamic aesthetic. Finished with silver hardware.  Want something a little more laid back? The AM1 STEP features an open frame design and cafe style handlebars. The silver deep rimmed wheels are complemented by ergo-grips and a super-plush sprung saddle. Embrace the pot-holes and enjoy a seriously comfortable ride.  The e-bike without compromise, the AM1+ features the same track inspired frame geometry and 420mm (16.5"")straight handlebars as the AM1 but is 30% more powerful. The AM1+ features Tektro mechanical disc brakes to ensure it stops as well as it goes. The deep-rimmed wheels are available in silver or black with matching hardware.   The ultimate utility e-bike, the AM1 STEP+ is 30% more powerful than an AM1 STEP and features Tektro mechanical disc brakes to ensure it stops as well as it goes. The AM1 STEP+ has the same open frame design and cafe style handlebars, brown ergo-grips and a sprung saddle as the AM1 STEP but the wheels are available in silver or black with matching hardware. Summary

Tool Kit
The AM1 arrives partly-assembled. This is one of the ways we kept the cost low. We offer written and video instructions to make sure assembly is super easy and takes less than an hour for a first timer, or even in as little as 20 mins.We also supply everything you need to put it together - all hex/Allen keys, spanner and a screwdriver. However, if you have any doubts, we can ship the bike directly to your local bike store as part of our Build Local Program. They can arrange for assembly at an additional fee and you can then ride it away; assembled and fitted to you. When we send out the shipping survey we will ask if this is something you'd be interested in.If you run a bike shop and want to be part of the Build Local Program, learn more about it here.  
Boast your build with a ""Built by"" sticker. Included with every bike.
 
  The AM1 had to be beautiful. We were inspired by the minimal approach of single speed and fixed gear bikes and were determined to make the e-bike equivalent. The AM1 has the minimum number of components.
 The AM1 needed to be as simple to ride as a regular push bike. Our earlier prototypes featured complicated displays and frame integrated batteries but these presented more problems than solutions. The AM1's battery clicks in and out in seconds. Park the bike outside and charge the battery inside. And to ride it... switch it on and pedal. The battery removes in seconds and charges just like a phone. Fully charged in 3 hours
 Turning up the assist to increase the power is a simple button press.
 Durability is also key to the AM1; a bike should be robust. We tested each and every iteration for months on real roads to ensure the AM1 is as maintenance-free and as hardy as possible. The early prototypes frames where made of steel. But for a bike that's designed to be left outside, steel is cursed by a tendency to rust.  Early AM1 steel frame rusting away Aluminium is lighter and doesn't corrode so is as happy outside in the rain as it is in a nice dry bike shed. This is why the AM1 has an aluminium frame-set. With tough rims, a 2-stage paint finish and waterproof connectors we take pride in endorsing the day-to-day durability of the AM1.  Sweat the small stuff. A studio time-lapse captures Nav and Jack poring over a frame detail.
  We're two product designers and bike nerds who've spent the last 4 years working on this bike. The AM1 is a distillation of all the knowledge and learnings gained through a relentless effort to pare-back an electric bike to the bare essentials.The testing and development of the AM1 brought its own test of challenges. Mainly, how can we guarantee that this bike will be reliable for different riders, load weights, road conditions and environmental conditions.So we built a testing rig...  The Chariots
Two AM1s pulling an additional person on the roads.
 
When it comes to product testing, controlled lab tests only tell part of the story. With great (electrical) power comes great responsibility and the electronics needed to be absolutely reliable.
To test the bikes at triple their intended tow weight we built The Chariots, the spawn of a late-night brainstorm into how to measurably stress test the AM1 in real world conditions.
The idea was to capture the weight of the rider and passenger, then conduct a series of tests to learn how each electrical component behaves under increasing loads. To no ones surprise, they were SERIOUSLY FUN to ride. To date, we've successfully completed tests with a leisure cyclist effortlessly towing over 250 kg’s (2 passengers + 1 rider) proving the power of the AM1. See for yourself.

 
The Battery
We completed an extensive program of battery development to find the perfect voltage, power and size of battery. We hand-soldered prototype batteries ourselves, rode tens of thousands of miles on them, and continually revised the size and placement until we we achieved the right power to weight ratio in a durable, portable and safe form factor.

Safety is paramount for lithium batteries. We made it one of our first ground rules that our batteries had to be of the highest quality and completely safe without compromise.

Disclaimers
Assembly: Due to the nature of shipping bikes internationally some assembly will be required. We provide clear video and written instructions, as well as the tools required with every bike. If you don't feel confident with basic assembly we have a process in place where can, for a small fee, ship the bike to your local bike store where it will be assembled for you and collected in person. Please add on 'Local Assembly' to your pledge to activate this option.

Battery life: On medium assist with a 165lbs (75kg) rider the battery life ranges from 25-50km. Actual battery life will vary based on a numbers of factors including rider weight, effort contributed by rider, wind, elevation and external temperature.
Production: All AM1 models in this campaign are production samples made using the manufacturers and supply chain we have in place. There may be some changes, modifications or improvements made to the scaled manufactured version which will be shipping to all backers.
Local Taxes for non-EU: While we do our best to comply with local tax laws you may be subject to import taxes or duties.
 
Risks and challenges
All the bikes shown in our film and campaign, unless labeled as a prototype are a production-ready factory sample. We have a 4 year relationship with our main manufacturer. The samples they have sent us have over 50,000 miles of testing, by us and our beta testers. We did not want to end up as another crowdfunding project that promises the world and delivers nothing years after the campaign ends. So we invested a lot of time and money early on in the process to ensure that when our campaign ends, we know how we're going to scale our manufacturer to fulfil your pledges.
That said, we are building hardware with components that are created in multiple facilities around the world. Sometimes components become discontinued or a particular part faces a supply chain issue. While this is certainly not our first rodeo, there are numerous logistical, political and natural events which we can't control, but we can handle them with minimal drama while maintaining clear communication with our backers.
Global shipping can also present some logistical and tax challenges but we have lined up a number of different partners to assist with navigating this.",34.0,2,"3 Campaigns

While the bikes certainly turned heads on the streets of New York, we couldn’t help but notice the time it took for us to ride the electric bikes from our hotel to Yankee stadium in the Bronx, (about 10 minutes), as we zipped along in the bike lane, past traffic jams and pedestrians alike. </p><p>The commute coming back to the hotel was another story.

Most Electric Bikes are either rear wheel drive mid - drive, rear system. This puts all the torque on the rear and as anyone who has ever driven through soft terrain like sand, snow, mud or over obstacles like curbs, stairs or logs, would know front wheel drive torque performs better. Ask anyone in the auto industry and they will give you the same answer.</p><p>With the motor in the front, you can go through any terrain. Also, with others rear torque systems, at top speed, in soft terrain, when you attempt to turn you easily could dig the wheel in and cause a dangerous situation. With our E-Bike, you just power through those turns. And by adding a little pedal power you have an ALL-WHEEL DRIVE E-BIKE that will cycle through any terrain and over almost anything!</p><p><span style=""font-family: 'times new roman', times;color: #e34e09;font-size: 18pt;""><em><strong>Why Ride a Fat Tire E-Bike?</strong></em></span></p><p>If you are a commuter looking to protect the environment or just a person looking to save money on gas then this e bike is for you. You can easily get around town, avoid traffic jams and enjoy the outdoors on our Electric Bikes.</p><p>Other great uses for our fat E-Bikes are for hunters, or a rider looking to go places they have only been able to get to on foot before, or someone that’s just up for some xtreme riding.</p><p><span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><strong><span style=""color: #e34e09;font-family: 'times new roman', times;""><em>Xtreme’s Fat E-Bikes will get you there!</em></span></strong></span></p><p>What makes Xtreme’s Electric Bike so much better than the rest?</p><p><span style=""font-family: 'times new roman', times;font-size: 18pt;color: #e34e09;""><em><strong>Our Safety Features:</strong></em></span></p><p><strong>Our Braking System:</strong></p><p>We only use Disc Rotors and Calipers and we use a 180mm rotor on both the Front and Rear for maximum stopping power.</p><p><strong>Our eBike Motor:</strong></p><p>Our motor only works with your thumb on the throttle; it shuts off automatically when you release it.</p><p><strong>Our Tires:</strong></p><p>Our Fat Tires are the widest width available which provides stability and superior stopping power.</p><p>Most other Fat Tire E-Bikes utilize either Center or Rear Wheel Drive Systems. This not only is a Safety Factor in Loose or Soft Terrain but, it also prohibits their ability to move through loose terrain or over obstacles.</p><p>The Rear Wheel Drive System is proven to turn poorly in Soft Terrain and can be hard to maneuver which can be dangerous at high speeds in soft terrain such as snow, grass or sand.</p><p>The Center Wheel Drive Systems can become unstable on uneven terrains and negotiating obstacles and have far more difficulty in climbing obstacles compared to the ALL-Wheel Drive System.</p><p>Our Front Wheel Drive System with Pedal Power creates the first ever ALL-WHEEL Drive for SUPERIOR SAFETY and BEST for getting through most any terrain, and over obstacles!</p><p><strong>Electric Bike Battery:</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fattirebikeparts.com/images/Removable_Battery_With_Lock.png"" src="""" style=""margin-left:auto;display: block;margin-right:auto;""/></p><p><br/>Our batteries are made by Greenway, one of the top Battery Manufacturers in Asia.

While the bikes certainly turned heads on the streets of New York, we couldn’t help but notice the time it took for us to ride the electric bikes from our hotel to Yankee stadium in the Bronx, (about 10 minutes), as we zipped along in the bike lane, past traffic jams and pedestrians alike. The commute coming back to the hotel was another story. It took over an hour by taxi cab as we waited in the traffic jams we encountered, enduring honking horns, road rage, not to mention the exorbitant taxi fare and tip! OUCH.So we got to thinking …“Why wouldn't more people commute using our Electric Bike?”The only thing we could come up with is where to safely store the bike when it’s not being ridden so we thought …Why not apply our patent pending front wheel / all wheel electric bike technology to a lighter weight, folding bike that a commuter could compactly fold in half and bring right into his office or apartment.We think we have really hit it out of the ball park with this one! Our electric bikes are already unique to all other e-bikes on the market in so many game-changing ways.1. Premium Kenda Tires to travel in any terrain from paved streets to soft sand, to trail to mud to snow, making this a go anywhere, any season, mode of transportation.2. Our patent pending front wheel / all-wheel drive, (adding pedal power), that SAFELY takes you upstairs over curbs and obstacles that might otherwise send you flying over the handlebars with a rear wheel electric system. Without power and torque of a front wheel system riding in any soft terrain like snow, sand and mud can allow for the front wheel of a bike to dig in and stop making it extremely dangerous.3. Top of the line rust-resistant components for extended durability and life of the bike.4. Ability to travel 30 plus miles on a single battery charge.5. Top quality certified and safety inspected sealed lithium ion batteries that easily remove from the bike for charging and safe-keeping.6. Both USB port and a 110 Volt Fanned Battery Charger to prevent overheating.Now add our electric bike system to the compact light-weight folding bicycle and you have: 1. A lighter faster electric bike with the ability to compactly fold and store in your home, college dorm, apartment, office, on boats or RVs, your car trunk … just about anywhere!Just unfold it and you are ready to go!2. The E-Buffalo is the absolute best green energy commuter bike on the market today … designed for commuting not only on the busy streets of New York City, but any city and in any season, snow or wet icy pavement without having to worry about traffic jams, and parking fees!Don’t live in a big city? Our fat tire, all terrain electric bike can handle a commute on country roads and trails as well.3. It’s a “no sweat” commute. Arrive “office-ready”; with no need to change from biking attire to office wear.4. The ability to bring your bike on a bus, subway, train, or high speed rail, tremendously extending the commuting distance.5. Year-round, street legal transportation ... No driver’s license necessary.6. An awesome bike for RV owners and Boat Owners, who need a way to easily get around town at a RV park or Marina. (We even sell tire covers to protect your boat, RV, home or office form scuff marks and tire debris.)Island hopping? This is the ideal bike to take you through the gravelly terrain of remote islands.7. But most importantly, our electric bike is safer than rear wheel drive, and more fun!Not only will you enjoy your commute, you will want to ride it everywhere and on any terrain … From sandy beaches, to mountain trails! We also have a camouflage painted sports version, designed specifically for hunting and gaming.Of course, we think are folding electric bike is nothing short of Spectacular! But you don’t have to take our word on it. We hired an independent professional engineer to analyze our bike design and his report supports the superiority in front wheel drive along with our rim design and fat tire.Download the independent report.Now Available in Three Distinct Styles and Color Combinations:Choose from:
Our popular Matte Black Bike with Neon Yellow Rims or Matte Black Rims
Our Camouflage Bike with Camouflage Rims, 
Or Our White Bike with White Rims!
Need to Finance Your Contribution?Click here to learn how to Finance Your Folding Electric Bike---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why Front Wheel Drive?Here's Why: By taking our ultimate Fat Bike and adding our Front Wheel Drive Electric System we feel we have designed and patented a ONE OF A KIND E-Bike. Most Electric Bikes are either rear wheel drive mid - drive, rear system. This puts all the torque on the rear and as anyone who has ever driven through soft terrain like sand, snow, mud or over obstacles like curbs, stairs or logs, would know front wheel drive torque performs better. Ask anyone in the auto industry and they will give you the same answer.With the motor in the front, you can go through any terrain. Also, with others rear torque systems, at top speed, in soft terrain, when you attempt to turn you easily could dig the wheel in and cause a dangerous situation. With our E-Bike, you just power through those turns. And by adding a little pedal power you have an ALL-WHEEL DRIVE E-BIKE that will cycle through any terrain and over almost anything!Why Ride a Fat Tire E-Bike?If you are a commuter looking to protect the environment or just a person looking to save money on gas then this e bike is for you. You can easily get around town, avoid traffic jams and enjoy the outdoors on our Electric Bikes.Other great uses for our fat E-Bikes are for hunters, or a rider looking to go places they have only been able to get to on foot before, or someone that’s just up for some xtreme riding.Xtreme’s Fat E-Bikes will get you there!What makes Xtreme’s Electric Bike so much better than the rest?Our Safety Features:Our Braking System:We only use Disc Rotors and Calipers and we use a 180mm rotor on both the Front and Rear for maximum stopping power.Our eBike Motor:Our motor only works with your thumb on the throttle; it shuts off automatically when you release it.Our Tires:Our Fat Tires are the widest width available which provides stability and superior stopping power.Most other Fat Tire E-Bikes utilize either Center or Rear Wheel Drive Systems. This not only is a Safety Factor in Loose or Soft Terrain but, it also prohibits their ability to move through loose terrain or over obstacles.The Rear Wheel Drive System is proven to turn poorly in Soft Terrain and can be hard to maneuver which can be dangerous at high speeds in soft terrain such as snow, grass or sand.The Center Wheel Drive Systems can become unstable on uneven terrains and negotiating obstacles and have far more difficulty in climbing obstacles compared to the ALL-Wheel Drive System.Our Front Wheel Drive System with Pedal Power creates the first ever ALL-WHEEL Drive for SUPERIOR SAFETY and BEST for getting through most any terrain, and over obstacles!Electric Bike Battery:Our batteries are made by Greenway, one of the top Battery Manufacturers in Asia. It uses a separate Water Bottle Mount that is not part of the battery like most other companies use and can be easily removed without having to take off any wires from the battery. This battery has a sealed shell that is completely Water Proof with its own built in voltage meter to tell if it needs a charge or not. Plus it has a neat carrying handle attached to it for Easy Removal to carry for security or take with you to charge. The 48 Volt system and uses only the best Lithium Ion Technology with Sony Cells. These cells are insulated and manufactured for maximum safety.Front Hub Electric Bike Motor:Choose From:- 1000 Watt with 48 Volts E-Bike System - 1250 Watt 48 Volt E-Bike System This allows you to have a Fat E-Bike that can take you literally anywhere!Rear Wheel System:Rear Wheel is a Quick Release Hub with a Shimano 11-36T Cassette and an 8-Speed Shimano Altus or Alivio Rear Derailleur.Now add these two great features together and here’s what you get:The only Fat Bike which is All-Wheel Drive on the Market.
